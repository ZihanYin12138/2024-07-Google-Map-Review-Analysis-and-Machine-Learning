I called to set up an appointment, but when the phone was answered, I was Rudely told the machine is broken & he doesn't plan on getting it fixed,
So then I asked him what I'm supposed to do with the Groupon,
He sighed & said Trade it in for something else..
That's fine if you cannot honor your gift certificate, but you don't have to be Rude in doing so,
Is this how your shop is ran ??
Maybe I don't want to try out their store for any other Service...
So Hard 2 Find a Quality Shop Anymore !!!
Oh Well...<//Text>

My homeboy told me about this place and I'm happy I went. Very friendly positive attitudes and it took less than an hour for them to put my new muffler on. I will definitely be back and I recommend this place to any and everybody. Thanks again👍</Text>

<review>I had an emergency exhaust issue having to do with thieves take trying to take something that wasn't theirs. I told USA mufflers about my issue and they responded promptly and told me to bring it in immediately. They fixed my problem very quickly & got my muffler and catalytic converter patched up and installed back where it originally was without breaking my pockets or Bank. USA mufflers is very professional and gets the job done.<//review>< Pics>

** BEWARE -- This is not a place to take your vehicle, shady stuff going on. **

I had a groupon for a 4 wheel alignment. I called them yesterday and they stated to come in today at 2PM. When I got there, I was informed the internet was down and they could not complete the alignment. I have the ability to work remotely so I let them know i'll work from their lobby and if the internet comes up that is good, but if not, i'll return another day.

Towards the end of the day at 4:45PM, the technician comes back into the lobby and states the internet did not come back up and will have to try another day. I was ok with this as i took the chance of it not coming back up.

When I asked for my keys, the technician went into the garage to retrieve them and then told me that my front two windows are completely down and that it just started raining. I told him i NEVER leave my windows down especially on a rainy day. He then said... I'm just letting know as to imply that i left my windows down. The car was completely drenched on the inside. In addition, my two hubcaps on the passenger were not completely secured and they were just hanging on there partially secured.

I can't help but wonder 1) why did they put both windows down, 2) what work did they really do by taking the two hubcaps off and 3) there was no work authorization form completed? If their internet was down, there was no reason for them to even get in my vehicle....

I cancelled the groupon and will be taking my business elsewhere. I've always been the type of person to support local business, unfortunately this is not one of them.

Its sad to see shops that rip people off, based on reviews I cant imagine what the charge would be once they get you in the door.
I found several places nearby and got the work done for $180, no suprises.

This is a very nice and noligable muffler shop. My wife needed a muffler on her car.. They new all the parts I needed and had them in stock..the price quote was very fair. All employees were neat clean and polite. I made a appointment and will update after install. But from what I experience this day and saw what kind of work they did. Noligable nice caring people and quality work on other installs.  I believe that I will not change a word and will keep this at 5 STARS. If you are In need of a muffler or other work I recommend this be your 1st. Stop. UPDATE AS OF 06-26-2020. I have been back here 3 times since my 1st. Review for some other muffler work and it's exactly as I said before I donot change a word. I will be back again. Keep up the great work...........<//Text>

I called around and got some quotes on a rear brake job for my truck.  I asked about time frames and prices.  I made an appointment because they were reasonable and timeframe fit into my schedule.  I arranged for a ride for me to be picked up, a ride for my daughter to her job, and ride back to pick up the truck.  I get there and was told it could take all day, I was also told the the price could be 100 dollars more. That so many things can go wrong. I am sitting there with tears in my eyes from disappointment. My ride was waiting for me and because I cried and questioned they in turn said they didn’t want to work on my truck.  Well I hear they do great work but they definitely need to work on customer service.</text>

<Text>Worst customer service experience in my life when coming back to fix a problem with labor and work. I truly thought they were a great company when it came to deals, customer service until I had something wrong. So the first visit for my breaks/ rotors went great. I even recommend them to friends. However my breaks where done on 11/27/17 and I went back on 01/23/18 . Since parts and labor where 90 day warranty after front knocking when  pressing breaks. I had already paid for a previous place to look at my car (not touch breaks because I didn't want to void the warranty) the owner I believe his name was Robert. He then tells me if he has his guys take a look, if he doesn't see it or think there is a problem then would charge me for labor.  I feel as a owner you would want to help and have customers return. I guess someone people just chase the dollar and don't actually care about having a credible company. When I ran or managed I always had higher business standards for myself.. different business morals... however if you decide to use them/ save with a deal Groupon good luck because you get what you pay for in the long run. If by chance you have any issue. The owner won't work with you at all.<//Text>< rate>

Skilled Techs, professionals, down to earth, Keith is a wizard in the shop. These guys do great custom work, multiple lifts and bays to get work done quickly and effectively. They carry a lot of specialized equipment to get jobs done that other places cannot

Rob is reasonable with pricing, he not out to scam like some other shops in the area.

Location has plenty of parking and spots in the back in case the car needs to have major work done.

They do Transmission services

Rob has the Hook on the MMA too</text>

They may have five stars from everyone else, but I can't give five stars if you don't even operate with the hours you told me just hours earlier on the phone. If you can get seen by this place I hope it's a complete 180 from my service.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Bought a Groupon for a 4 wheel alignment. Went in a week ago and they stated too busy and made appointment for weel later, today. Came in 10 minutes early and could tell not really interested in doing it but took my info. Said it would take up to two hours. Mechanic drove car came back, put up to machine, drove out and then told me he could not align as their machine did not have specs for a 2015 Kia Optima. Complete jerk around and grouoGrwill take 10 days to refund. New to Carmichael and will not come to this shop again.</review>

Where to start? I bought a Groupon for front and rear brake pads with tire rotation. Called to setup the appointment and was told I would need another $90 plus dollars tacked on due to SUV size charge and a special kind of brake pad. I agreed and made my appointment for 9am on Saturday. Showed up to the shop, no one was there. Shop was locked. Called after 10 minutes and it went to voicemail. Then I get a call from Jason, the gentleman that I initially spoke with, that he is going to be there in 5 minutes. He showed up at 9:20 and said that "he had a rough start that morning". I leave him my car and my friend and I leave. I get a call 30 minutes later. He can't do my back brakes because I have City lock and he needs a special tool for that. He knew what make and model and year my car was before I came in, a week after I scheduled my appointment, he could've done his research and looked up the specs on my SUV or asked me originally as I know my car as City lock brakes. I say ok, well please just do the front ones then. Another 20 minutes he calls back and says it isn't my brake pads it my rotators and those need to be replaced, but again he can only do the front ones. He also would have to put whole new brake pads on. Now my quote has gone up, on top of my Groupon, another $200. I tell him I'm going to come get my car and I do not want him to do anything. Legitimately the whole situation was unprofessional and I lost two plus hours out of my day because he didn't bother to do a little research before I brought my car in. He seems really lazy, especially when he couldn't be bothered to even show up on time to his own place of work.</Text>

Thank you for the excellent service you gave to my Pontiac Sunfire.  I found the experience to be fast and cost-effective.  In the past, I've gone to garages who would take advantage of me by adding unnecessary services to inflate my bill.

I will gladly recommend this establishment to anyone I should come into contact with.

Sadly I can't even give this place 0 stars or else I would.  I found this place on groupon and seen all the reviews so it looked like a good place to go to but that was not the case . I was told to come in at 12pm for my front brakes to get replaced I was told $30 more for the better brake pads which I was fine with.  I understood that only one person was working so I had to be patient but it took an hour for him to even touch my car. Then he said i needed new routers and he gave me a price i said no problem let's do that.  Then about 2 PM he said my car was almost done.  Then by 2:30 PM he said my brakes were not working at all and that he was going to bleed my brakes and see if that works.  He only bleed the front and then said it did not work and that I needed new boosters then said calipers so at this point i was upset and was trying to figure out how much everything would cost me and what was going on . I then called for a ride and my friend is a mechanic and once he got there he asked the guy what he did . The employee jason couldnt even explain what he did or what was wrong.  I no longer wanted him to work on my car . He then was rude and proceeded to try and charge me so I guess he talked to the owner and the owner said not to charge me.  So he acted as if I then owed him something.  I had to pay for my car to get towed to another shop which cost $100 and then they did a full diagnostic and fixed my car all he had to do was properly bleed all of my brakes that then costed me $120 . I dont appreciate that he tried to charge me for parts and services I did not need.  And i spent 6 hours at that shop when i didnt have to . In the end my car got fixed and I will never go to this shop again nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone.< /text>

<text>I'm not really the greatest customer when it comes to auto repair. I've been jacked by too many places. At Automotive USA, both Robert and Mike were honest and knowledgable. They took care of me from start to finish. More importantly, these guys know how to treat there customers. I won't go anywhere else from this point on and I'm coming from Elk Grove but it's worth it. Oh and free wifi, video games for the kids, GREAT COFFEE and just plain fair and honest business.< /text>< response>

<review>These guys are a step above! I came here to get smog ready and I received just that. I had a bad o2 sensor, that they replaced durring inspection they noticed that my vacuum lines were bad, oil was low and transmission was low. They took care of all my loose ends that were not required for the smog and topped my fluids free of charge. Thanks guys.

The sign out front says Free Estimates... I went inside they tell me it's $85.00 diagnostic charge. This is a scam to get people in the door...<//Review>

< Review>
It is a very pleasant place to be. Not necessarily the Pacific Corinthian Yatch Club, but just being away from your home town, wherever that may be, is very invigorating. The California coast line is very beautiful. If you own a Yatch and rent slip then I guess it's the place to be, Unless you're already a member of another yatch club. It's a great place to be on the weekend especially if you've had  a very stressful work week. The coastline of California is a great place to decompress. Yatch clubs are just a part of the decompression process. Where do the locals go to decompress? Hopefully they have their own decompression techniques, or maybe living there is enough to keep anyone grounded.< /Review>

<Review>I give them 5stars. I had little wait time in line when dropping my car off. The manager explained to me my tires were ordered but they hadn’t received them yet, he said they were due in by ten. He went over everything and offered me nitrogen to fill my tires, I had never had this offered before. He explained the pro’s to getting this nitrogen and I thought it sounded great so I accepted this @ $18 per tire. Overall I had great service and I will definitely go back.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

So now My sister in law will be be paying them a visted soon and get her car taken care of. Thank you to Mr Guillermo and his staff for helping me out.</Review>

Free alignment check which is a nice additional service to getting tires.  Realize this is NOT a part of American Tire!  The price they quote on the phone is NOT the finish price. (I should have asked for out-the-door price, my bad.)  For 1 tire, out the door was $50 more than quoted price.  No time quoted for service to be completed,, and, probably Covid related, but very boring wait room (no wifi, tv not working, no magazines, ect.  yes free water!).   I guess you could just call this a basic, no-flash-in-the-pan tire store.<//Text>

I  came in complaining about a sharp metal noise coming from my driver's side tire. I had a missing bolt/ caliper pin on my tire. I never would have thought that could be the problem considering I just had my brakes done by another shop. They were so quick to address the problem. Very thorough.< /Text>

<Review>Been here a couple times.  Always looking to upsell you items or repairs you don’t need.  So many independent places that do the same work or better for HALF the price.  Don’t be fooled by their “free inspections” —if even your brakes or alignment are new, they say they aren’t.  Owner (bigger guy) acts like he’s your buddy, but he’s not.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>I was not sure if the store was open today due to Memorial Day nonetheless it was open
The workers are very friendly and respectful to all its customer.  Also purchase the alignment plan for 3 year and take your vehicle in as often you need to check your alignment.  I have had the plan for 2 year so and it has pay for itself.  When the plan expires I will purchase another plan for a peace of mind.  Thank you for being there.</Review>< pics>

Definitely had a good experience here at the tire depot. Had to get a few tires changed and the service was great! Had two of my tires replaced and one of them repaired. Workers were professional and considerate. Took a while to get it done but all in all I was satisfied.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Our service at American Tire Depot II was very good! Guillermo, Ordered Michelin tires that hadn’t come in yet, from day before around 6pm. My wife at the latest The following day needed to be at work at 2:30 so Guillermo found a Toyo tire that was cheaper to get us on our way on time and even was able to squeeze in a front end and rear end alignment. CJ courteously moves our car to customer area and informed us on work performed. Great service from good men. Thanks!</Text>< pics>

I noticed my tire was going flat so I filled it up. I could hear the air still hissing out. Walmart automotive was closed. I just barely made it to the driveway when it said 0 air and on straight rims. They told me to go very slowly and park in the 1st spot. They got me a matching tire and I was out in less than 20 minutes. They beat the tow truck. Thank God. Now I’m on my merry way to finish all my shopping. Thanks Guys</Text>

< Review>
Absolutely horrible over all experience. First I call got two different quotes both times I called. Then on top of that I got four new tires didn't come with the warranty that they talked about they didn't state whether the outside tire damage would be fixed under the 45,000 mile warranty tried to sell me a warranty turn around the valve stem for the tire was defective or didn't install it properly then when I went back in they said if it's anything around the outside of the tire they would charge me for an additional tire. Managers name was Guillermo the district manager name is Tony then when I tried to contact Tony he didn't answer the phone he would only text back with no action. Not professional for a business at all.</Review>

<text>Service was horrible and the staff was a bunch of liars!! I went in for new tires and  was told that I need to replace tire sensors that were fully functional. When I refused the up sell I was told that I  couldn't  purchase the tires without the sensors. I went right over to another  tire shop and purchased new tires WITHOUT new sensors and also received   better customer service.< /text>< pictures>

I got a used rim and bold tire for a customer car and the cost was totally  out of reason 142.00 that's way to much other tire stores like the tire store no more than 50.00 tonys  tire the same I  do business with  both I'm a mechanic and been here since 1956 and the staff are rude.<//Review>

<review>Great service! Needed my master cylinder replaced and they got it done for less than I was quoted elsewhere. Also had them replace my worn brake pads. They installed new tires on my car a while back and they had the best prices and tire selection I could find. Will be going back!</review>< Pics>

Tito and his guys were amazing! They don't throw you around and tell you need everything done that you don't need. I got in and out in less than an hour with 4 tires without blowing my budget! I will be coming back and definitely will recommend them HIGHLY!< /Review>

< Review>
I've purchased several tires in many years. my last visit here was to replace a tire that was defective good thing I purchased the road hazard insurance. the problem was that they forced me to purchase the hazard insurance on the tire being replaced. if I didn't purchase the insurance they would not give me my tire that I purchased with the insurance for the first time around. it does not indicate anywhere on the documentation that i had to repurchase the hazard insurance.not sure if I should pursue legal action.< /Review>

Looked online, closest one to me was Eastside Car Wash & Oil Lube. Posted time for closing was 6pm. I drive over there @ 5:25pm & it's already closed. Locked up tight. Since most places close @ 5-6pm, I'm upset because it wasted precious time. It's now 5:40 before I get to the next place that also states they close @ 6pm. But they claim it's​ too late to do an oil change today, even tho the bay is empty, employees kicking back chatting. That's how I wind up here. They were very accommodating, courteous & professional. Waiting room was tidy, as was their service bay. The employee who wrote up my service order was Jose and he couldn't have been any kinder. And the absolute best thing of all? No ridiculous up-sell for other things I knew I wouldn't need. My car had just hit 100k miles, Jose explained and recommended paying a bit xtra for the synthetic oil vs reg oil, which I did. Also told me I needed new tires in the rear, which was true. I already knew that. Can't recommend this place enuff. Best xperience I've had in a LONG time. Thank u Jose & staff @ American Tire Depot. You've earned my business & I'll b telling everyone I kno.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1592319929577, 'text': 'Hi Brandi,\nThanks for the awesome review!

I went to the store and was refused service because they were too close to closing time.
I was in quite a spot because I needed my truck for work in the morning. The repair would’ve taken only five minutes. I was so mad I wanted to tell the guy that I need a lot of work done to my truck and he just lost all of my business.
I went down the street to Primos Tires at division x J St. they took care of me right away!</Review>

Food was super late. Super cold and super tasteless. I really wish the restaurant would have issued me a refund. I don’t complain and I don’t argue but this was plain nasty. It really was a larger order and everything was nasty. I can’t imagine all the food being cold and gross. I will never come back and also not let any of my friends or associates. They tried to an order and send it cold and had no care for the customer. I’m here trying to help the small business but it sucks they stuck me with that poor quality< /text>

They have canceled delivery items on me several times and quality has been low on delivered food. Seafood items + hot pho soup don’t make for great items delivered. This was my last time giving them a chance but failed again. When they first opened, quality and service was good, but now well below that. Bummer. Was really rooting for them. :-(</Review>

Great little mom and pop spot. I had the protein roll and the ring of fire. Both were packed full of flavor!  Staff was friendly and took protection for the COVID pandemic. It's a must try spot.<//review>

EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING

Literally walked in and felt good, the people were nice. We sat down and the chairs were comfy. The table setup was really nice and calming. The place is pretty small, but its really comfortable. The tables and separated with in of space that you wont feel crammed. It took them a few minutes for them to come and take our order. We ordered 2 Chicken Pho bowls, edamame and does white vegetables rods. The Pho was amazing 1000/10. After we payed a decent price and gave a tip and left! Thanks so much for the best service and great food! Definitely coming here again!</Text>

Will be coming back again indefinitely. luckily for me this place is absolutely close to us which makes me happy. What I found was the prices for my fav type of rolls are cheaper and at great quality. Though they were late to open they made up for it! good job hope you guys get plenty of business.</Review>

Husband and wife killing it! Best sushi in town, the lazy chef we have renamed fat chef! Their pho broth is superb and everything was amazing. Fresh fish on the rainbow roll, the salmon melted in my mouth! Please try support, they deliver via grub hub and door dash!!! Amazing! Will be back again and again!< /Review>

< Review>
Nov2020: it saddens me to have to change my review from a 5 star to a 1 star. I was happy to have a pho place so close to home that took pride in the food quality. We should've knew something was wrong when the restaurant was closed early on sunday. We decided to try again and noticed all the staff was changed, possible new owners? We still wanted to give them a chance, but was disappointed by the service. We ordered pho and sushi lunch and the pho arrived quick without any chopsticks or eating utensils. then were informed there was no fresh bean sprouts or basil. They offered carrots as a substitute, but that would change the whole composition of the flavor. We asked why they didn't tell us before the food arrived so we could order something else, we weren't given a answer and walked away. We then asked for the sushi lunch to go and we waited another 15 minutes till we realized the sushi was never made. Instead the owners just talked in the back, obviously not happy with our decision to not want an incomplete pho. I've never walked out from a restaurant in my life, but we weren't given much choice at that point.

March2020: Delicious broth, hearty portions and tasty sushi. Happy to have this place close to home. (Photos from this visit)<//Review>

<Text>Currently, this is the best Sushi in Imperial Beach. Most of the Nigiri was very well prepared. A couple ones had the rice a little too compact concerning the Nigiri, but not a big deal. The fish is fresh and the rolls are well prepared. We especially enjoyed the salmon Nigiri. Also, they give you good sturdy chopsticks, and not the cheap ones that will give you splinters or split apart incorrectly.  I'll edit this review when I try the Pho. A must go in IB for a close by sushi fix!<//Text>< GmapID>

Took a more than 45min to get the food. They didn't want to issue a refund. Buyer beware this place lost its touch. The employees don't really care, they should let you know before hand if its going to be a whole hour before you get your food.< /text>

I usually have to add extra spices to my noodle soup before I eat it. This place knows flavor! Didn't have to put anything before devouring. Their sushi (and customer service) is rivaling Sushiya in Eastlake. Since I live right down the street I will probably not go anywhere else for my pho or sushi cravings.< /review>

My kids love this place. The Doctor and the staff are very welcomed, friendly, helpful, and experienced. Doctor Kareem spends as much as you need of time to explain about your kids teeth’s health.
I highly recommend Children’s choice pediatric dental care.😊<//Text>

Best dental place! Honestly my daughter's loves going to the dentist as everyone is always so great. You feel that they care, not just their job, but you can see they enjoy being there, from making sure your child feels comfortable and actually conversating with them. The whole experience is always so pleasant. Dr. Linda has been amazing for the time my daughter has been going to this dental office. We had a bad experience with a prior dental office and we were recommended to childrens dental and have always stayed loyal to return. They explain everything so thorough and so happy with them! Once you enter the front door the amazing experience starts!< /text>

<Text>We were clients for more than 3 years there, love doctor and technicians. Unfortunately their lack of payment options stopped us to visit this place. Keep in mind they don’t have any modern options like Apple/Google/Samsung payments, they do not accept checks either. They accept only card payments or cash. After a year of global pandemic you would expect doctor’s office to embrace new no-contact payments but no they are still operating like it’s 2019< /Text>< date>

Hello, I am a person that rarely leaves any reviews. However, I felt compelled to leave a review due to a recent experience with Children’s Choice Dental Care in Glendora. All the staff was extremely professional and polite. Dr. Kareem was great with our daughter and Rosa his assistant was very informative. She answered all of our questions and concerns in a very professional manner. We had a very positive experience there and recommend this location.<//Review>

This place is amazing!

We love bringing all 4 of our kids here! They have a clean and spacious waiting area with games to keep the kids entertained, and appointments are always timely.

All of the staff is extremely welcoming and sweet, they are considerate, calm, fun, and really good with kids, you can tell they truly care about what they do!

They always give balloons and little gifts at the end of the visit, which the kids look forward to.

All the procedures are explained very well, they explain every step to the kids very patiently, treatment plans are emailed to the parent, and the parent gets to sit in during  treatment.

I am 100% satisfied and happy that my kids are seen here now, we will definitely keep coming back!</text>

<Review>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.
This facility may look like they have everything available.  Orthodontist and Anesthesiologist who work with them but in reality THEY DONT EVEN COMMUNICATE WITH EACHOTHER 🥴
I have 4 kids and 1 has Autism. Been waiting for weeks to get treatment for my son and now he has to wait because the Anesthesiologist decided to take the holidays off (blames COVID-19) yet the dentist will have 3 kids in a row in chairs and they are not 6 feet apart.
They also advised me to go somewhere else for my Autistic son.
My other son had to return to get an extraction because the dentist didn't see his teeth growing behind his baby teeth. I caught it after and didn't understand how the dentist missed it.
My daughter needed braces and the dentist didn't even recommend her to get them (the assistant made the call and told me )
This is what I'm talking about with no communication with in eachother and they are ALL suppose to work together 😒 . 2 weeks ago the Anesthesiologist decided to stop, unfortunately they didn't tell the patients that were already waiting.
I was mad , agitated and annoyed with everything because at the end of the day they don't understand.  If they did they would of cared more about how to help him but all they really care about is 💰 money.

I will take my kids somewhere else and I have been coming here for years. I hope the owner reads this because this is unacceptable.  I always end up paying out of my pocket , even with insurance. You would think they would treat my kids better.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

My son was traumatized at his last dentist place I had to look for one that would make him completely comfortable, as my first time there and my sons Erika was sure enough make sure we were all comfortable. She did an amazing job getting my son to be calm and comfortable and not afraid of what she was doing to him. I loved that she explained everything to him before she did it, just awesome even the dentist so kind and patient that after the visit my son said “mom I liked this dentist” I’m so happy they also have dental appointments after 2pm  that was actually why I chose them first out of everyone else it was important to me that I did not have to interrupt my son at school.</Review>

<Text>Monday was my first time ever going to a Dentist she just turned 3 and i put it off for so long because i was nervous about how she might react.  Her Dental Asst Anna was SO SO AWESOME!! She made her feel comfortable and was explaining everything in detail to me and was letting my daughter help with holding the tools to make her feel comfortable.  I was honestly so surprised at my daughter reaction.  My daughter didn’t have any cavities which was a big plus . I’m so happy I chose this place<//Text>< pictures>

Children's Choice is the best dental office I've had for my children!  The staff is so friendly and patient with my children.  One of my children is autistic and requires special handling. Dr. Kareem works so well with my autistic son.  He is patient and so competent. This office is the best ever!< /Review>

I have been taking my children here for almost 3 years. My 8 year old is extremely sensitive when it comes to teeth, but all the staff help him feel comfortable and do all his cleanings as fast as possible.  My now 2 year old is now on her 3rd cleaning...her 1st appointment was more just introduction to the tools, and a fast look at her teeth. Now that she just finished her 3rd appointment she sat for an entire cleaning! The dentist talked to her and even sang to her the whole time keeping her very distracted and entertained. She was very happy. My 12 year old loves coming here too. I would 100% recommend this dentist.</review>

The best dentistry ever! I definitely recommend this place. My kids enjoy the dentist and the staff. Always a quick process and never any complaints. The staff really take pride in handling each patient according to their comfort and needs. My daughter had the hardest time at the beginning but now enjoys coming! I thank each and every member for their patience and warm personalities each time they handle one of my children. Thank you so much!</review>

<text>Anna and Dr. Kareem are miracle workers. My son was incredibly nervous to get a crown today. Anna reassured my son everything was going to be okay. She was able to speak to him on a "motherly level," dry his tears, and get him to sit through the apt. Dr. Kareem has such a calm presence to him. I absolutely love the relationship he has built with our family over the years. I would highly recommend these two and the entire office!< /text>< Pictures>

I have been taking my daughter here for the past several years and could not be happier.  It is always a pleasant experience for me and, more importantly, it is a place where my daughter feels extremely safe.  On this particular occasion, Anna helped us out today.  She had a wonderful personality and was very interactive with my daughter, which kept her mind off the cavity she was getting taken care of:( Hopefully the next visit is under different circumstances lol</Text>

Have always had a great experience here. My daughter had an area of concern for me.  i called to make an apt and they allowed me to come in the very next day to have it checked out.  Was made comfortable the whole time and all concerns where addressed and the Dr. even offered his email address so I could take pictures later on if any more concerns came up and he could let me know if I should come in or not.  I love this Dentist, wish I had known about them with my son several years ago.</Text>

Amazing facility!! They make you feel really comfortable. The Facility is very clean and kid friendly. My son has been coming to this place since he was 2 years old, the care we receive at Children's Choice is amazing. The staff is very knowledgeable and helps adapt to each child's particular needs , yesterday I got the honor of being attended  by Domonique. I will like to say thank you for making my son feel comfortable at his visit I appreciate. Definitely 5 stars!</text>

Best children's dentist! The Dr. and staff are great, they make the child comfortable and talk to them so they understand what is going on and what all the tools do.  They have a movie to watch if they need to wait and once the Dr or hygienist it working with the child they make it fun with silly stories  and when they are done they get to pick a prize and get a balloon! The office is always clean and the staff is very professional. Dr Kareem is the best!<//Review>

I scheduled an appointment for all three on my children for the first time and was pleased to find available appointments the same week. The office they went to before scheduled so far in the month. Their previous dentist also had a tiny office, very dull looking (considered it was a children’s dental office) and they wait time was horrible. The moment we walked in we were greeted by Elizabeth, super friendly. The office was so nice, colorful, updated, and clean. So much waiting area space for the kids and my eight year old loved the tablets on the wall to keep them occupied. Paper work was a cinch and the staff was all so nice. They were super friendly to my daughters who both were nervous. Jennifer was our assistant, she’s the best with kids!! Dr. Kereem seemed to love his job. I recommend this office to everyone. We will be making this our official dentist.< /Review>

After being through 3 different dental offices we are definitely pleased to have found Children's Choice.
We have 4 boys ages 18months, 4, 5 and 11 and the staff and Doctor were very caring, patient and thorough. They made sure the boys were comfortable and talked with them throughout their cleaning and exam so that they would not be afraid or nervous. They explained everything clearly to both my husband and I and listened to our concerns, never making us feel beneath them. We were able to schedule appointments with out any issues and they are not weeks out like with the other dental offices we have been too. Definitely staying with children's choice!</Text>< pics>

I would give Children’s choice Pediatric Dental Care 100 stars if I could.  I have to say it was an amazing experience from beginning to end.  My 3 year old son was visiting for his first dental appt. ever.  He was crying at home in fear not wanting to go.  We got him there and he was a bit hesitant.  Erica called him in and sat down to talk to him to explain everything that was going to take place. (Brush, floss, clean, pictures, Dr. count his teeth) She earned his trust immediately in how genuine and kindly she spoke with him.  She took him back put on a movie for him and began his service.  She was so gentle and entertaining as she got him to be comfortable with “Mr. Kisser” (the suction instrument)  and “ Mr. tickle” (the cleaning instrument) before ever putting in his mouth.  She has a magical way with children and you can tell she loves her job and children.  The office was very clean. I noticed after my son had x-rays she cleaned everything up and even wiped down the seat with a disinfectant wipe prior to next client sitting in seat.   I observed all the staff and all were so friendly from receptionist, hygienists, Dr. and other staff.  I watched them all interact with the children, parents and co-workers. Smiles and kindness all around.  During his short wait for his x-rays my son said “ mommy you were right, there is nothing to be afraid of….this is great! When can we come back?” He took his x-rays like a champ and Dr. Kareem came over and was so calm, caring, playful and he was wearing a spider man costume.  Come on how fun is that? Upon leaving he received a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, balloon and toy.  I found them from a review and so I wanted to help spread the word of excellent service!   Erica, thank you again for taking care of my son!<//Text>

Horrible and careless place to take your child....my child was having a very bad toothache (he had a cavity)I called and got an appointment all they did "they charged the issurance as a visit and asked me to come back afternoon " I went and Shannon the Glendora manager told me "I am sorry we can't take your child R.in bcs Dr. Tarek doesn't want to stay here longer is our last day working 05/23/19 you can bring your child on 05/27/19 if you want" . I was bagging her bcs on 05/24 I was traveling to Europe.
Shame on all of you .....FYI we've been going to The Glendora Children Choice Since 2017..
I took my child to Dr. Alquiros to fix his tooth.< /text>

<Text>I just took my two daughters here for their very first dentist appointments. I have to say, I was VERY pleased with the way all of the staff made it a pleasant experience for my girls. When they did a cleaning on my older daughter, she showed each instrument to her and told her what it does. Everything went so well. My younger daughter went in for just an exam since she is too young for a cleaning but they did well with her too despite her wiggling and not wanting to cooperate. They were so patient and pleasant. I wish there would have been more places like this when I was a kid! As a bonus, the girls got to pick a movie to watch and they got balloons, 2 little prizes and toothbrushes at the end. We are DEFINITELY coming here again! Thank you for giving my girls such a positive experience! =)< /Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<text>I came here for a check-up for my two-year-old.  We arrived on time for our appointment at 11 am.  After 5 minutes at the lobby we were taken to the examining room.  We waited, in the reclined examining chair, for a long time, watching cartoon on the TV.  During the wait, I was told repeatedly by the assistant/technician that the doctor would be with us "shortly"...and that he was with another patient.  The doctor finally showed up around 11:35 am and performed an exam that lasted less than a minute.

I do not think it is acceptable to make a two-year-old wait for that long.  It was getting close to his lunchtime.  The last thing I wanted was a cranky, hungry two-year-old having a negative first-time experience at the dentist.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c326329aa2d119:0xc0ebc494de7ceebd<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I have four kids, all half Hispanic.  this office is well aware of how many kids I have, and that THREE of them are special needs.
I get covid is going on, but to not be told when you make treatment plans that you will be expected to leave one of your special needs kids 100% alone in a waiting room for over an hour while one gets treatment, then do the same to the next is OUTRAGEOUS. But hey only one parent and the patients.   I get that i am white, but I never expected to be treated differently based off that. While discussing this another ENTIRE Family comes in three kids two parents.... They say nothing, one child even hugged a dental assistant.  All while telling me that me leaving a child alone is due to "safety" and can only have ONE PARENT, and they can not break rules due to Safety.

It was pure discrimination, even my Hispanic special need kids were asking why i was treated differently. I 100% feel if my Mexican husband had taken them, they wouldn't have said a word.</text><username>Heather White (Bettycrockerburn)<//username>< GmapID>

<Review>Recently had an emergency in which one side of my 4 year-old's face was considerably swollen to the point of disturbing the area under her eye. It caught us by surprise. Took her to hospital where they thought it was either a sinus infection or possible tooth issue. They prescribed an antibiotic and sent us on our way. I believed it might be a tooth issue and took her into Children's Choice. They gave me an emergency, same day appointment, took x-rays and extracted the tooth given there was an abscess around the root under a crown she had put in 8 months earlier. To make a long story short, they were very kind and efficient.They also let us know what our options were. It was difficult to see that happen to our child but they made her as comfortable as possible. The new doctor there is great and she has a good bedside manner. I would recommend it.<//Review>< Pics>

The office is exceptionally clean and a pleasure to visit. There are TVs with a movie going most of the time for the children in the waiting room, as well as, believe it or not, a few low-key video games. In the chair, the child has a screen above him or her to watch his or her movie of choice in order to make the child comfortable and distract the child from the procedures - though we have not yet come upon a procedure that the office did not handle exceptionally gently, quickly and with care - and we've had some pretty big procedures. I would absolutely recommend this choice for your children. I should add that one of my children has special needs (autism and intellectual delay) and the office treats him with dignity, courtesy and with full understanding, at all times.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< username>

<Text>Hands Down-Children's Choice was the absolute best in accommodating my 7 year old for his first dental procedure (a cavity and crown/mini root canal) . Being this is our only son, and this is was his first time -I was deep down inside extremely nervous but Children's Choice and their entire staff did a wonderful job in explaining the whole procedure-calming my son's nervousness, accommodating by filling our request in Dental Assistant (Sabrina) and most important being supportive to our very little nervous patient. Dr. Kareem is AMAZING-working wonderfully with children-making our son feel comfortable and assured him all would be ok. Dr. Kareem's bedside manner is spot on and he has by far a great way with children.  5 full stars to an absolute wonderful childrens dental office-Thank you!!!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< time>

<resp>None</resp><text>Getting the initial appointment with referral process was a nightmare. Paperwork is not their strong suit and there was very minimal follow up after I had called numerous times to see if the treatment they had diagnosed for my daughter had been approved. Somehow the direct referral was filled out incorrectly from my primary dentist office and then Children's Choice did not send in x-rays like they should have to Delta Care to have treatment approved. This ordeal was very stressful as I had to be calling parties on all side because it seems like no one knew how to fill out the correct paper works!

I was getting ready to say forget it and wanted to go to another Pediatric Dentist. But that would have needed ANOTHER referral!

After all said and done..... everyone was great when I got into the office. They were patient with my daughter, explained all the equipments/instruments that would be used on her in kid friendly terms (She's 4). They knew all the tricks in the book to get her comfortable. During the treatment, the dentist was kind, polite, and very accommodating!

The only bad experience was the all the hassle of getting the referral..... getting ALL parties to do fill out their paper work correctly. Everything else has been great......< /text></record>

Overall, the dental experience was a positive one for my son's first trip to see a dentist. The way Cherie took the time to explain everything she was about to do before she did it, and let him ask questions and touch the instruments beforehand, even hear the noises they'd make, made for an easy first visit. It didn't hurt that he also got to pick out a movie to watch on the ceiling above him while they did his teeth. (where are these choices for grown-ups?!)

The one thing I was frustrated by was not so much in personnel but in practice. I had called to make an appointment specifically with Dr. Jaclyn Bae. And had waited for a time that she was available. When the dentist came in to work on my son, I noticed it was not Dr.Jaclyn. The attending dentist was fine. But that is not who I had booked an appointment with. Nothing had been said to me, no one had called ahead to let me know or ask if I wanted to re-schedule. It felt less than honest. And I had not chosen this practice, rather, I had chosen to bring my 4 year old here for this specific doctor. They have a 24-hour cancellation policy and the patient pays a fee if you cancel for any reason with less than 24 hours. I would assume they would afford the patient the same luxury and let us know if something changed and they had to cancel.  I am hopeful that this was an oversight, rather than a common practice, with the end game of just keeping a full calendar to make with the bottom line in mind.

For this reason, I cannot give CCPDC the highest rating.

I'm hopeful they will take this into consideration in the future.<//Text>

The staff at Children's Choice always show knowledge and treat us with courtesy starting at the front desk Jasmine helped me with my appointment and Alvida Harris dental assistance including the Dr Kereem Husain with his great sense of humor make the kids feel at ease. The crown job are not easy but the Dr and his staff make sure isn't a problem and a bad thing. I will recommend to other people. As I have done it before to various friends. Thanks for everything .

My 4-year-old daughter ran into a friend at school the previous week. Bruising to gums noted soon after with some wiggling to lower front tooth noticed a few days later. Called the Glendora office and was set up with an appointment the following day with minimal hassle (this includes handling referral issues). Immediately greeted when I entered and my daughter headed off to the iPad/video game section. Called back within five minutes and was immediately taken to the x-ray machine. One quick picture and then she was off to the exam chair. The patient gets to choose any movie or show they can pretty much think of and it is quickly running up on the ceiling. The technicians are all wonderful and know exactly how to work and speak with children. Dr. Kereem arrived within five minutes of my daughter getting into the exam chair. He immediately addressed my daughter's bleeding disorder and showed some knowledge/interest that is all to commonly overlooked (surprisingly) with medical professionals. Walked me through the x-rays and gave me some expectations over the coming months. Dr. Kereem is fantastic. He speaks with the children, never above them, and is extremely personable and accommodating. We are already making plans to adjust our insurance next year so we can be primary patients at this location.<//Review>

<Review>I have been taking my sons and daughter since their first birthday. With out hesitation I reccomend children's choice! When you walk Into the office you get greeted by kind receptionists who always have an answer to any questions you may have and if they don't they find out. The waiting room has iPads and PS for for the older kids to play. There is a tv with a little kids movie always playing and lots of toddler books and toys. The chairs in the back are colorful and inviting for the children and they have every childhood movie you can think of to play while procedures are done. They are clean and well organized. The dentists I have seen have been amazing! They are good with the kids and friendly and work off of their terms. I hate feeling rushed or not important but they aren't like that at all! At the end of the visit they always offer kids a new toothbrush, toy and balloon! Makes them excited for coming back and an incentive for getting a teeth cleaning or filling filled. I babe reccomended this place to many friends!!!</Review><rating>5</rating><gmap_id>0x80c326329aa2d119:0xc0ebc494de7ceebd</gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures>< name>

I took my son to children's choice for his first ever dental visit. As we arrived, we noticed that the building was new and modern which was nice compared to allot of dentist offices we've seen. When we walked in, nervous about taking our young child to the dentist because of our own horrible experiences, we were greeted by a smiling receptionist. She was very nice and helpful, and even offered us something to drink. Our son instantly ran to the wall of tablets set up for the kids to play with while we wait. They had tons of games on them for the kids of all ages to play. We only waited about 10 min's- top, even though the office was busy with lot's of other waiting families. It probably helped that I had my paperwork ready, printed from their website ahead of time and filled out before we arrived.

We were called back by a VERY nice dental assistant whom also was smiling-I don't know what her name was but she was a pretty young Latina, to a secondary waiting room, to await his ex rays. We waited about 5 more min's, and we were able to utilize their sink with their free tooth brush and tooth paste to brush his teeth before his ex rays.

When she called my son back to have his ex rays, he grabbed onto me and didn't want to go. The nice young Latina girl said to him "do you like movies?" and she asked him what movie he liked and told him she'd put it on for him. Instantly he let go of me and followed her. I thought to myself "BRILLIANT!", as I was a little teary eyed because I hate to make my son go this. It's absolutely brilliant that they do the movies for the kids. Bravo!

He sat through the ex rays for his first time with a smile on his face. That really made me and my husband relax. After ex rays, another very nice nurse took us to our spot for him to get his teeth cleaned and meet the Dentist. This nurse was an older Latina lady, smiling and kind just like the rest. She made my son feel comfortable, and me and my husband feel relaxed. Such a relief! I can't even tell you how relieving this is. My husband and I have never seen this at any dentist before. It was the best feeling to know our son was in good caring hands.

The dentist came out, a pretty young Asian lady. Again, she was smiling and kind. She explained to him what she was going to do, then she counted his teeth and examined them, she was very sweet to him and you can tell she was born to work with children. She reviewed his ex rays with us, and went over any concerns.

Then another very nice nurse a young black girl with braces and a beautiful smile that makes you smile, took us back to let our son pick out a balloon and a toy. What I call the cherry on top!

I could not be happier with our experience. My husband and I walked out of their almost shocked because we did not expect that. All our memories of the dentist were not good, and we were dreading taking our son. All those feelings are gone, and my son has been begging me to go back to the dentist. Wonderful!

Thank Children's Choice, God bless your entire staff. Your kindness, and understanding of children's fears and needs are outstanding! You definitely get my nomination for BEST Children's Dental Office! Keep up the good work, and we'll see you in 6 months!

The Ruppert's,

<name>Christina Edwards<//name><time>1470200483764< /time><Rating>2< /Rating><Review>I was semi comfortable taking my son here the last few years. The place is nice and entertaining for the kids, but they go thru doctors atleast once a year. The first dentist who did treatment on my son got rough and visibly agitated with my son for crying and moving (his first treatment ever!). His face looked like it was being handled roughly afterwards. Complained to Sharon who is now the manager and a man with so little patience should not be working on kids. She assured me they do not run their practice that way and will escalate this to the owner. She made me feel comfortable and confident to come in again and he was no longer there. Today, Sharon would not give me the time of day to talk about my $52 balance that was causing them to not continue with our appointment.  I was offering a payment arrangement, as I did not have the money to pay today. Another girl came out and said "Sharons in a meeting and we cant see you today but you can reschedule when your going to pay. If I call the billing department to ask, they would yell at me". I asked for the billing department number and we left. (she handed me the business card to their location). Very disapointed in the interaction I had today and I am back to being uncomfortable with this office. I cannot bring my son to a dentist that is all about the money.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c326329aa2d119:0xc0ebc494de7ceebd<//GmapID></record>

<Review>My CCP is Amazing and I have never felt more comfortable taking my daughter any where else. The doctor Mr.Kereem is amazingly talented with my toddler he goes in there and trys to make the procedure as fast and painless for the child. I always recommend my childrens choice because you are in good hands here All the staff is friendly and very helpful. I can't describe how happy I was when I finally found CCP. Like I said if you have a Toddler and are scared of the dentist go here they do the best to make it fun as well they play movies while your waiting and even getting your treatment done plus your child gets a prize when they leave it's a win -win situation.</Review>< Name>

::Update 1 to 3 stars they reimbursed me for the cost to repair the wheel.

Went in for a simple tire change, was told they could do it. Picked up the next day to find my wheel severely damaged and from the start, NO ACCOUNTABILITY and still haven't received an apology. There has been no effort to make things right and fix my wheel. I had to pay out of pocket and drive to the bay area to get the wheel fixed. Manager repeatedly said they didn't do it, and then I got him to admit they messed it up, but then they had the nerve to claim my paint job was cheap, (ITS A VIPER WHEEL) and started chipping it off in front of me. I will be reaching out to corporate and filing a formal complaint and to get reimbursed for the damage they did. Very untrustworthy, no effort made, never received one phone call from them, or an apology. I had to take everything into my own hands. FIRST PICTURE LITERALLY BEFORE I DROPPED IT OFF, 2ND PICTURE AFTER I PICKEC IT UP.< /text>

I was in Tire Choice twice in the past week for my two vehicles. One for routine maintenance service and one for emergency tire repair service because the rear driver side tire was punched by a nail on the road. The store manager, Greg, inspected the vehicle first and then let me know if I have any other safety issues which I am not aware of and need attention. He has lots of patience explaining the issues.  He pointed out that the 4 tires are no longer safe ( I am totally unaware of the fact) because they are over 5 years old! I care very much of the vehicle safety. Gregg convinced me and changed all 4 tires for me at a reasonably good price.  The key is the job was expeditiously well done! He just repaired the punched tire, apparently it was evaluated to be salvageable, which saved me some money. I am thankful for the tire repair job too.<//Text>

I went in to see how much it would be to remove the nail from my tire and to my amazement they said it was free. Not only did they remove the nail from my tire but they also reset my TPMS for me and adjusted the PSI of all my tires. All of this absolutely free and the latter without me requesting.</text>

Upon arrival they must’ve been busy because I stood there for about five minutes before anybody came out to help me. There was no one else in line only me, there were people waiting in the lobby for their car to be finished. I used my cell phone to call the store phone, only then did somebody come out. The staff is very professional and knowledgeable but I left for the second time with my tire pressure incorrect, on the courtesy inspection paper they said the tires were at 32 psi, but they were not and they still are not a few days later.< /review>

<Review>Son's 2006 Mustang into them for rear brake job as squeak must be the brakes.  They found bent drive shaft and damaged shock.  Brakes were perfect.  Repaired except for axle which will be replaced later.  Great job.  I think they are super good!<//Review>< Resp>

Great service!!! My alternator went bad on my car, the mechanic Dave took the time to drive to my house to jump start my car,(so glad I live nearby). Talk about going above and beyond for their customers. My wait time for the job to be done was faster than expected. Now my wife, who is a nurse that works the graveyard shift, can make it to work on time at ease knowing that Nicholas at the shop took the best care of us. Will go back. Thanks again!!!</Text>

<text>Being new to Tracy coming from the The Bay, I searched around trying to look for  a Tire Store/Shop  but found very few and I've always dreaded having to want to go the Costco / Pep Boys .. especially when it comes to specific brand Tires and  non shelved models that I was needing.  Having done my research and confirmed what I wanted,  I came across Tracy Tire Pros  and read the reviews.  Though Few,  It gave me enough peace of mind to give these folks a go.   Having Talked to Christy last week she answered my questions and within a few minutes confirmed and placed the order for a set of Michelin Pilots and an appointment for install.  Upon Install day which was today .. everything went seamless. As with all Automotive services, it WILL take about one to two hours tops with no problems presuming.   IN THE END,  I have received top notch real world service, got the product that I needed at a fair price to boot.  Thank you Tracy Tire Pros. Will see you again when I hit the 5K mark on the Michelin Pilots.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Excellent customer service! Had a tire that constantly seemed to lose pressure! Had taken it to another local tire shop to have air pressure checked! They would periodically put more air in my tires, especially the rear driver's side! Never realized the reason I was having a problem with air pressure was because I had a nail wedged in it until Good Year (Certified Tire) noticed it and were able to repair it immediately at no charge! Thanks for going the extra mile for me and providing me peace of mind!<//Review>

< review>
👍🏻T., Tony and David treated me right!
I left my car with them in the am and told them I’d come back about 5-5:15 to pick it up.
I randomly stopped by the shop, between job site visits, I found my car was already finished!
So I went in to confirm that was the case, pay and at least get my keys, to come pick it up later after work.
I went out to my car and, in such a rush, I accidentally locked the keys inside! T. Got Tony and David to come rescue me right away, and in a matter of a few minutes had my door opened and me back to work!
Thank’s Guys you’re awesome!</review>

T took my back, had me look at what he saw and explained to me what my options were. I like how he walked me through everything that was going to happen. I’m also fairly young and look younger. No one in the shop took advantage of that and tried to provide extra services that were unnecessary.
Upon leaving they provided me with the next steps to continue to maintain my vehicle.

All of the workers there were very friendly and professional with the perfect amount of humor. I’ll definitely return for future car maintenance.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>I took my 18 year old RV in to get the tires and fluids checked, Christy and John took care of me. They recommended changing the brake fluid, which hasn’t been done in 10 years, they did it, and even gave me a ride to get my car.

Can't give a zero.  Why? Before I found out, they sold my wife a new rack and pinion. Really? Not like she was hitting every curb or pothole for the last 2 years. Con artists! My daughter's car went in because a/c wasn't working. Told her she needs a completely new system as the entire system is dead. Cut her a deal, only $1450. I said no and the next day, the a/c works just fine. 4 months later, it went out again and a different garage replaced the condenser for $400. No problems since. Not like the old owners, these guys see a chance and they swoop down for the kill.  Women, in particular, steer clear of these guys.<//Text>

This is the new shop for both my cars. Duke and Ron are the nicest most down to earth guys around. They have performed strut replacements, smog check, new tires, ac check, and breaks for me. The price has been very competitive the work is done in a timely manner. I would recommend this shop for all your car troubles.</Text>

Date of incident: 6/9/2019 - 7:55AM & 8:05AM
Please monitor date of recorded phone call with Robert.

Alrighty, let's make this feedback constructive: First encounter with Christy (front counter admin) was about a grade level 5 out of 10. Here’s why: I walk-in and she bypasses a greeting. No worries, she’s on the phone, completely understandable.

However, head mechanic walks behind the counter of the lobby area, we then begin discussing my BMW’s service codes. I presume via eavesdropping, Christy interjects with probing questions. Probing questions not delivered as, “I want to take care of your problem,” but more-so, “do you know what you’re talking about?”

Rather than introducing herself or clarifying if she was the designated spokes/person to ask questions too (which she never did) because again, she was on the phone and didn't bother greeting me. She interjects and says: ”Just because you say that's what's wrong with your car, doesn't mean that's all that's wrong with it,” which is an agreeable statement (after all you are the expert). But it’s now what you say, it’s how you say it.

At this moment, due to body language, mannerisms, authoritative tonality and interesting customer service or lack thereof, I’m taken back and realize... She is either having a bad day or extremely power-tripped. Christy eventually finishes her phone conversation, I share my car information with her and schedule it for servicing.

Upon diagnosis, it turns out, my detailed maintenance reporting was accurate. My Serpentine Belt was worn out and caused my ‘Battery Malfunction’ code to appear on my dash. Mechanic diagnosis’ my vehicle, places an order on corresponding parts, replaces the belt, courteously refills my window washer flume and voila. I pay and receive keys.

6 days later:

’Battery Malfunction’ code appears again and car starts driving weird, so I am forced to pull over on the freeway. As result I have to use my limited emergency road side insurance and have my car towed home.

The following morning during reg business hours, I speak with Robert about Tire Choice coordinating a tow from literally just 5 miles away as the initial error they were suppose to correct is now present again. Robert isn't sure if I’m worth his discretionary decision so he deliberates with Christy.

Lo and behold he gets back on the phone with the news. When I express to him the decision does not make sense and verbally initial how BS the decision is, he begins debating with me, talking over me, all while raising his voice.

All in all, despite the warranty on their work, these two have managed to make me uncomfortable enough to never trust them with my car again. The maintenance was bad, the customer service was worse and the lack of accountability for the work performed was the cherry on top. After all, attitude is a reflection of leadership.

Corporate - I have dialed your website number and have sent over an email to you as well. Please advise</review>

This place is terrible. Came in for an alignment fix, took half a day and they gave me my car back in the same condition it was before. Not only that, a few days a later I got a flat tire and went to Les Schwab and they told me i had wires sticking out from the front two tires probably from Good Year's unprofessional at fixing my alignment. If you could go anywhere do so, do not choose to go to Good year for anything.</Text>

So I decided to give a local mechanic a try in Tracy. Scents I did not want to keep going to Manteca for my car repairs. But only this time I just needed a oil change.
When I dropped my car off. I got a call about all the things wrong with it and potential problems. When I heard how much it was, I was blown away, over $1000 to fix everything. I felt there was no way my car had all them problems. A day later I took it to Jack's Transmission in Manteca.
An honest man and said to me that my car looked good. All it needed was spark plugs. So don't be fooled by Goodyear mechanics. They will rip you off.
Rack and pinion is one of there favorites.< /Text>

<Text>Everything seems so much higher in price now.  The shower gels are $14.50 each. The sale was buy 2 get one free so for $30 you get 3. That's expensive.  The sales people are too pushy and annoying you cant walk in without them hounding you like a car sales man. I was asked 4 seprate times by 4 different people if I knew what I was looking for or what was I shopping for. You dont need that many sales people around hounding customers. That's why I hate going to Ashley furniture they are the same way ! Less employees means you can lower the prices down a bit< /Text><Rate>3</Rate><UserId.>100865091327858251071<//UserId.><Gmap_id>0x80dc71890ff40c13:0xc4a368aee9014f7b</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Be prepared to stand in line, they are only letting up to 15 people in the store at a time. I recommend checking their hours of operation since they have also changed their hours and was told by a sales rep that they open later than some of the other stores. For the most part the sales reps were polite, helpful, and taking the proper precautions. Only wish that the sales reps were all trained on their products. There were some of the sales reps that did not know about products, current promotions, and pricing.<//Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I absolutley love their candles! I have them burning all over my house, and the smells are just divine. They last so much longer than anything I've bought prior, so its totally worth the splurge. And to top it all off, the candles scents can still be smelled even hours after they've started to burn. They are, quite simply,  the best candle out there.<//text>< Pictures>

<Time>1560261505263< /Time><rating>5</rating><text>I love their sales! You can really stock up for months if you shop right. I signed up for emails so I can have extra deals sent to me daily. They seem to have a special on something each week. Hand soaps for $3 instead of $6.50. I love the foaming soaps. They last a long time. They have white barn candles here too. I look for those first. You cannot go wrong with a soy based candle. It's tough to decide on just one.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWwJKM11rFyQOQJ4b8iX7_Bdn-hbpORK3_-0DY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I love this place! You can literally spend 6 hours there. People say the stuff is overpriced, but I think it's perfectly fine for the high quality products they have. The whole month of January and June are my favorite times of the whole year because they have AWESOME sales. The only complaint I have is that it's too addicting and I can't stop going there 1-2 times a week. They have so many delicious scents there- I can't stop buying things! Best. Place. Ever.<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc71890ff40c13:0xc4a368aee9014f7b<//Gmap_id>< Pics>

This is one of my favorite shops. I like how the merchandise is displayed and appreciate being able to 'test' the various products. The candles smell great and last a really long time. The only negative is I always spend too much $$s in here!</Review>

<Review>What a pleasant place! There's quite a big array of scents and you can try out a selection of products you're thinking about buying, the staff is very helpful and friendly. I've spent quite a lot of time in here and especially love the different kinds of soaps they have. The little baskets are so cute and they have many hand sanitizers and funky little covers to go with them!</Review>< Pics>

I like the candles here my favorite is mahogany teakwood. My only problem is that I can only do a quick stop in here. The smells are all over powering in the small area. That is all Bath & Body Works though.<//review>

< Review>
Worst experience of my life!!! They have the worst cashiers ever! They need way more training. I went there to get buy 3 and get 3 free. Payed for everything and it was $60 WHAT! I did not see what the amount was after I  put my card because it did not show up and she did not tell me. Then she told me when I was done paying that $60 was my amount. I told her that I wanted to return everything because I don’t know why I was paying $60 if you buy 3 and get 3 free. She did not know how to return my money back to my card because it did not let her. She give me back the money in cash; however. She give me back $26 first I don’t know why. Then she give me the rest. THIS IS WHY YOU DONT HIRE YOUNG PEOPLE TO WORK IN THE CASHIER PLACE!! I was there for half an hour just getting my money back.</Review>

Nowhere on their website does it say that the discount I was looking to get was exclusive to their website. In fact, I found a number of offers on candle discounts that were mysteriously not available in the store. The employee informed me that the website does different sales from the store. Yet the website does not mention "online exclusive" or differentiate itself from the retail stores.
So let me get this straight, I can price match at Fry's Electronics for a price on amazon... a totally different company... But bath and body works... Won't price match their OWN website. Never wasting my time there again.</Text>

I think this is the largest William Sonoma in the south bay. They are fully stocked with a variety of kitchen/home supplies.  They also have a large selection of books on sale. The employees were very helpful when I asked a question. During Christmas time, they wrap your gift at no cost (complimentary).</review>

Unless your face is full of Botox and your bag says Gucci...the employees ignore you. They must work on a commission. Bunch of old lady's who pick n choose who they help. Very discriminatory customer service skills!< /Review>

Pricey, but has a gigantic variety of high quality cooking and dining goods. I like their samples and hope to someday take one of their offered cooking classes. The store is clean, well organized, and has beautiful displays.</Text>

Was just in this store. Tried to get someone’s attention for 10 min to pick up a coffee maker. There were 4 who could have helped us. They did their best to ignore us. We walked out. Cannot recommend this store.<//Text>

<text>We've been to this store many times in the past 5-7 years. The customer service is always top notch (and of course they have high quality products). I found Kaitlin Brown to be particular very helpful on one occasion when we wanted to price match an expensive purchase.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<review>I went to Williams-sonoma to purchase an all clad set.  I called ahead of time to check the stock and they were down to the last set. I asked them to hold it for me, they had no problem doing so and were very polite on the phone. I went at prime time during the holiday season and did not have a horrible time parking. The store was fairly busy but the staff was still polite and helpful. I would defanitely recommend shopping with William-sonoma.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

This Williams Sonoma location is ground zero for wealthy Los Gatos foodies to congregate and shop for gorgeous high-end kitchen gadgetry, flatware, Shun knives and other fun stuff. While this shop is richly decorated, the aisles between merchandise are quite narrow. As you can expect, this makes for a crowded (but polite) scrum on weekends. The friendly clerks roam the aisles, and are always very proactive in making sure that your questions are answered - a mark of responsive customer service.<//text>

<rating>1</rating><review>*UPDATED June 4th 2021*

For those that require proof about the company and other negative reviews, I have the email trail/documentation that supports my claim and can provide if requested. I will also provide feedback on additional websites to ensure others are not caught off guard by their products offered (bait and switch) or their customer service. I only want the truth to be revealed about this "company".

The company has now stated that they will withhold the correct furniture I ordered because I left this review, and they will only ship the correct furniture if I remove the review and in Ana's exact words "promise not to post about the store". See below for full details:

I rarely write reviews but this was definitely needed. I ordered a leather living room set and I received the wrong color. Before I placed the order I called and they said the color I wanted was in stock, however they were deceptive and sent the wrong color instead.  I've made numerous phone calls and left messages via voicemail and have yet to receive a call back.

I wrote an email and Ana explained that I would have to wait until mid March of 2021 to receive it, but keep in mind this was in December of 2020. It's now the beginning of June 2021 and I have yet to get an answer. They are still not answering the phone or returning calls or emails, and have even closed the chat box on me when I tried to get an answer on their website (Thanks Kelly!).

Like the other negative reviews state, do not order from this company or risk getting defrauded out of what you ordered, dealing with low class customer service, or both. Please heed my warning as well as other's and DO NOT deal with this company or you'll regret it. Let myself and others serve as an example of the interaction you'll encounter should you choose to do business with this garbage company.< /review>< pictures>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>The bed we bought from Prime Classic Design is amazing.  It arrived on time and was well packaged.  The quality of the product is great but the only problem we encountered was the instructions were very minimal given the complexity of the bed.  So many pieces yet one page of cryptic instructions to follow.  Had my husband not been in construction there would have been no way he could have put the bed together.  We love the bed though and get so many compliments on it.</review>< pictures>

<text>The merchandise is top quality.  They (Prime Classic Designs) are very knowledgeable and courteous.  I needed the couch as soon as possible and they delivered it as requested. I was very surprised because no one else could do that.  I am going to buy another couch from this company because I know I will get top quality at an excellent price.</text>< Time>

Everything we ordered has been delivered as per schedule.
Very quality products, looks exactly as showing on website.
We are very happy, well worth the wait of few months to get all the items which came out of the country (from Italy).
Price was reasonable and we enjoy our bedroom and living room sets every day.
Thank you.<//Text>

Long story short, I ordered a king size bed which looked completely different online. Spoke to a gentleman named Mike and he basically said that’s what you get we can’t do nothing about it. Since it was already unpacked and built they couldn’t return it when it’s literally one day old brand new I didn’t expect a full refund but at least a portion store credit SOMETHING but nope did me dirty.....like this is a total scam I did not receive what I ordered !!!!<//text>

Received our couch in the 2-3 week time frame and was so thrilled to have it delivered. Courteous and professional driver and helper helped set it up in our living area. Beautiful couch, It’s Italian leather but made in China so that was our only misgiving.<//review>

< Review>
I called more then 20 times ( 11/6, 20,24,30, 12/4,9....etc), after finally got someone on the phone named Mike , he was extremely rude, he coldly responded there's nothing he can do about my exchange and  hanged up on me, other times no one actually answer the calls, it's much easier hit the lottery then getting anybody answer the phone. Stay away you will regret it< /Review>

i just don’t understand why this business runs this way.. like common now this is far the most unprofessional experience I have ever dealt with... It has been over a month and still no response on the shipping of my sofa cushions. Two weeks ago the customer service rep said she would get to me to verify my delivery address and a tracking number. Haven't heard a word from her. Emailed her again and my email to her was declined..... really disappointing<//text>

<Text>Pros-
visually nice furniture
some high end looking elements

Cons-

Poor customer service
Minimal support post purchase
Overpriced for the quality
Missing hardware

poor joinery, I was told that the headboard and frame of my bed should be attached with 8 wood screws, this is a $3000 bed, seriously!? I bought a interim bed for $200 from Amazon that was had better quality joinery... this is very important to the longevity Of a bed so I’ll have to do some preemptive  modifications.

After calling and talking to Mark, I realized I made a poor purchase. Price wasn’t a factor, I wanted a good quality bed... I didn’t find that here.

I just wanted to say thank you for a smooth transaction and a very speedy
delivery. The love seat is beautiful, well made, and looks very high end in
solid black. The delivery men were awesome! They worked quickly, were very careful, worked clean leaving no mess behind, and were personable and respectful. I will definitely deal with you in the future.<//Review>

<Text>My complaint is not with the furniture. I love the furniture and the  Quality. However the customer service sucks. I informed them from day one of receiving my sectional. That the recliner was inoperative. It's 1 year later and they still have not fixed the recliner. After dozen of emails and please.  I am now forced to go to the better business bureau and making  An  Official complaint.< /Text>< Pics>

I am currently using an alternate bed frame because I do not have the hardware needed to put the one supplied together. I reported that to prime classic. Sent emails with pictures of what was provided.

In our last conversation Mike was rude and condescending. I tried to get a resolution but they have stopped answering my calls.</text><UserId.>103066239507483117229< /UserId.><Time>1602364790436<//Time>< resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>My wife and I highly recommend this company! We had been searching for a new, quality leather couch locally in the Florida Panhandle for 7 months and extended our search to the internet before finally committing to Prime Classic Design. We were hesitant to purchase furniture from an online company (especially one over two thousand miles away), however Mike extinguished those fears in our first phone call. He was always quick to respond to emails with answers/solutions and was always punctual in returning our calls. My window of opportunity for phone calls is very limited, especially with the time difference, and Mike always accommodated my schedule.

The delivery was incredibly smooth with zero stress. There was very minor, superficial damage to the couch which was documented by the delivery crew upon installation. We contacted Mike, who quickly and adequately remedied the situation. The couch is, without a doubt, the most comfortable and supportive couch we have ever had the pleasure of lounging on. We are happy to have found a piece of furniture that does justice to our 400+ sqft living room.

Only time will tell if the quality of craftsmanship is as good as the customer service. We believe it is incredibly well made and the quality of Prime Classic Design's leather is not exaggerated. I hope this stands true five years from now, we'll let you know!

Should we need any furniture in the future, my wife and I plan to purchase from PCD and Mike. Thank you for being a company of integrity!</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2b8e720651abb:0x7bd7515dff277827</Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Yes sure Prime Classic Design offers an outstanding service I ordered a couple of home sets which were delivered in a timely matter you have to take into consideration that the furniture you order internationally has to go thru customs inspections which can take long delays be patient your furniture will arrive. Other than that I have no complaints.
Thanks.

I was not sure how good the quality of the furniture wood be considering that I ordered it online.

I had found this Sofa and Love Seat on lots of websites but it only came in white. I found Prime Classic Design and they had the Set I had been looking at and offered it to be made in the color I desired. I picked an Italian Lt Grey Leather sample and had it sent to me. After receiving the sample and confirming that the color was good. I ordered the Sofa and Love Seat in the color I wanted. I was told it would take about 12 to 16 weeks for a special order. I was contacted when the Sofa and Love Seat arrived in the States and again when it arrived and was ready for delivery. I received them and I love them, they are beautiful. It takes a while when you special order but it was well worth the wait. I would definitely recommend Prime Classic Design, Great job!!!<//Review>

First of all I am not a negative commenter, I just want to help other customers and this company for better turn.
I bought a queen bed set cost more than $4000,it took 3 months to receive, once it come ,it was so much different than photos in website ,the drawers and dresser is so small looks good for kids room ,bed headboard looked huge and luxury in photos, but it's just a tiny tinny short headboard ,hides behind pillows, the worst part is the pooriest quality ,it's very lightweight, feels like made out of double cardboard and a piece of wood was attached to sed for better style ,it felt apart because it was glued, probably cheapest glue have been used, I am very disappointed, they don't accept return, I wish i knew all this before my purchase and never bought from this store .< /Text>

<Text>BUYER BEWARE!!! This company will take your money and not allow you to return anything.  I paid $1800 for furniture and they sent the wrong color and wrong size. I asked for a return date and they refused. Their promise of hassle-free returns is a lie! And  the pictures and descriptions on the website are not accurate. Furthermore,  they promised delivery and set up. When the guys arrived,
they said  they don't set up anything. Lost $1800. Not worth the risk!< /Text>< GmapID>

Prime Classic Design is a wonderful store to shop for furniture. We purchased a beautiful contemporary dining table & chairs that you will not see in local stores. We also purchased a contemporary Italian  leather wrapped bed which we love. One very important service Prime Classic Design provided: free storage in their LA warehouse for over two months until our condo was completed in Palm Springs.<//text>

Bought an European bedroom set from Prime Classic Design.  It came without the mattress and side table which were ordered.  Once we received the mattress, it was like laying on plywood.  Their website states, "Hassle-Free Returns within 30 days, simply contact us for RMA"  We called the very next day after purchasing a new, softer mattress locally.  All the mattress companies we looked at locally offer 90 day up to 12 month full return credit.  They refused to take the mattress back even though it was unused.  We then started a dispute with the credit card company that issued a temporary credit for the mattress.  However the company provided the credit card company with a "policy" saying they do not accept returns and so we were recharged.  So they provided information never disclosed to us which refuted the stated policy on their site.  They lie!  Don't do business with this deceitful company!</Text>

I found exactly what I was looking for after looking all over the other furniture sites.  Customer service was beyond any experienced previously, I received several follow up phone calls, with accurate information.  I was extremely impressed with the quality of the bed and mattress I purchased, I would recommend this company very highly.<//text>

Mike provided a discount price on a buffet, one that he himself owns, or so he says.  He either doesn't know his own product or he's a liar.  Claimed that the doors and drawers were soft closing hinges which of course they're not.  Retrofitted hinges with soft closing hinges myself.  Delivery was prompt and buffet arrived in good order.  This is why salesmen are so hard to believe.< /review>

< review>
I ordered a bedroom set made in Portugal, 2 months later it delivered all pieces except the dresser. I called them,they said it was back ordered. I asked them why they did not tell me when I place the order,the guy answered he does not know. He responded in an angry manner like it really my fault. I called again after a month and got the same guy with the same answer which is still waiting for the dresser. So make the issue short, I got my dresser 5 months after the order. Another issue with this website is that I paid extra for delivery to the bedroom of my choice, but the driver said he did not about that and left everything just inside the house. I did not want to fight against the driver because I know it was not his fault. He just do what was on the invoice. I really have more problems with Primeclassic. Please take my advice,do not purchase anything from them. Good luck to you if you decided to buy from them.</review>

Simple put, don’t not buy from this company. No customer service, won’t take responsibility. I don’t understand why this company can survive this long.

I placed my order back in Dec 2018, soon it will be end of April, during this 4 months, no follow up from this company, I contacted them 3 times for details of my shipment. Needless to say, on their website it’s said as a 8-12 weeks order, which is so untrue.

Today, they actually sent me an email stating the shipment is damaged, and asked me to contact my credit card company to get a refund. They failed to delivery and won’t even issue an refund without troubling their customer.

Wish me luck for getting a refund.< /text>

<text>Dishonest and deceptive seller!!!! Beware! Ordered a sectional (sku 53078) originally advertised as genuine leather all around, confirmed by a gentleman presenting himself as Mike during a phone call. The couch arrived more than a month later than originally  planned. Upon inspection I realized that more than 60% of the sectional was covered by a cheap thin leathermatch like material. I talked to the delivery driver but they refused to take it back. I contacted Mike who then said he will reach out to the manufacturer in Italy. It took more than 3 weeks and multiple emails and vocemails to get a response back that the couch was according to the specifications. I opened the website and noticed that they removed the "genuine leather all around "description.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1556828259100, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback.

<user_name>Han Ph< /user_name><Text>I bought a half Italian real leather sectional sofa on this website in November 2015, but did not receive it until April 2016. They said the leather is from Europe and is manufactured in an Asian country.
The delivery crew was unprofessional. The store sent me an email with things to check upon delivery. But the delivery crew was in such a hurry to get the sofa into the house without giving me time to check everything. After unpacking, they literally threw all the packaging material into my garage (boxes, pallets...), which took my husband and I 2 months to clean up. We had to take a little bit out each time when the trash company came. That was a pain.
It has been 5 months since I had this sofa, but the plastic/leathery smell is still strong and is very unpleasant. I sent Prime Classic Design an email asking about this problem and they just sent back several web links on the internet that tell us ways to get rid of the smell leather without further help. I asked a leather expert. He said that even though it is real leather, if the tanning process is not done correctly, it doesn't stop the rotting of animal skin. Whatever the reason is, the smell of the leather is horrible. I am afraid that it may affect the health of my family.
One more thing, they said the real leather covers area where the body touch, but one arm rest has real leather; the other arm rest does not. I feel cheated. I paid $3,700 for their sofa and have serious buyer remorse now and want to get rid of it.  I don't recommend buying from this store. I am serious.</Text>< pics>

These people are despicable. Can't even get them to do their job before a sale. Finally got someone to call me back, the guys argued with me about a product they show as in their lineup on line NOW SAYS IT NO LONGER EXISTS!  Was given the item sku in early April, but I lost the paperwork.  These people are HORRIBLE DONT DEAL WITH THEM.  I will be contacting Houzz to advise them of their terrible behavior!  BEWARE! In addition they dont even have a customer service in their name, it's called Capri.  I was calling Prime Classic Design.< /Text>

The product that you like does not come in the color you want. We accept it is upsetting but it is what it is. If we could get it in the color you prefer, we would, but the factory simply does not make it. Hope you find another item and will enjoy for years to come!'}</response>

<Text>We ordered over two months ago. It was a christmas gift to my daughter. It is now April 30, 2014. My daughter called and emailed many times. We even paid for Premium Delivery. Today, I finally received a call that they will deliver the bedroom set. I asked about set up; the delivery guy stated they do not set up anything. They only take out of the box. After several emails back and forth with a "Mark P" and I quote "Your bedroom furniture will be put together but the bed. From my experience drivers do not have time to install the bed. The dresser and nightstands will be assembled and all unpacking will take more than 30 min in total. I will make sure they unpack all boxes but we usually do not have time to finish everything." NOT premium service. Especially when their site suggests and 30 minutes after unpacking they will set up. I will wait till tomorrow to see the furniture and how it goes. I will be responding back here and possibly contacting my lawyer. If they set up and love the product..i will recant here. I am not holding my breath.

Day 2 - movers arrived. Stated they ONLY unpack the furniture with no set up. Even after numerous emails to Owner Mark P. With him refuting that it means set up.... Sending my own invoice from Prime Classic Design showing I paid $245 for Premium Delivery and Set Up. LOW AND BEHOLD - the first piece was unpacked - both legs on the dresser completely cracked and fell off. 2nd piece of furniture unpacked - nightstand leg cracked and appeared to have been glued and painted over. At that point I told the movers. Take it all back - I refused the full order. Wrote within the 24 hours of delivery per their website. We will see what service, refund, etc will come forth. Again. Not expecting much. I would attach the pictures here if I could. Best of luck to all - I, 100% would not buy or order any furniture from Prime Classic Design.<//Text>< Pics>

<Response>{'time': 1420003398927, 'text': 'We always encourage all clients to go over our store policy prior placing order. The buyer purchased a bedroom set and paid for Premium Service. The order was made via website and upon checkout we explained every option to choose the level of service needed for this delivery. The email that we also sent acknowledging online order confirms "Two-man delivery inside + basic set-up". The customer was under impression that the bedroom will be fully assembled. However, the area the order was going to was not eligible for installation. Our websites clearly informs what service covers and how order is handled for each state. In this case it was qualified for basic set-up which was delivery inside and unpacking (pieces put on top of each other or next to each other in the room). The two pieces that arrived damaged were offered to be exchanged for brand new ones but that was refused. Due to disagreements about delivery and product, the order was cancelled. A full refund was provided within 24 hours.'}<//Response></record>

<Text>My first time at iPic Theater and I had a great time. $64 for two people is a bit pricey for my taste but being served food, alcohol in a soft leather lazy boy chair it’s worth the price. This theater was very clean  and the lounge area is beautiful. I would recommend coming here for a romantic date or a great place to hang out at the bar. Very upscale and nice. Valet is $3 per 15 Min but iPic will validate your ticket up to 2 HRs.

I love this beautiful old theatre! Going to see movies here is a very special experience because the theatre is very beautiful (inside and outside) and the organ man plays (almost) every evening show!The seating is great. A while back I tried the balcony for the first time. Awesome!<//Review>

<Text>My first time on this theater and what a great experience! We rented one of the rooms for a private event. Cozy yet super modern atmosphere - including two bars and good service. That's right, you can be watching a movie and order food and some drinks and they will bring it to your table. And yes indeed, between each pair of coaches you have a table where you can leave your items and orders. I definitely DEFINITELY will go back soon. Perfect place for a date< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<review>Excellent service and overall experience. The more intimate setting allowed us to more personally enjoy the movie as opposed to a giant auditorium. I suggest the VIP seas as they're basically large, comfortable recliners. We also enjoyed the cocktail bar right outside the theaters on each level.< /review>< Name>

Nice, comfy, roomy and quiet movie theater with amazing and delicious restaurant quality food and beverages, perfect to bring your date to. Upgraded seats get a free complimentary popcorn bag, with added blanket and pillow to their reclining seats. Spend a nice amount of money for the food and you won't regret it, I promise you can eat alot more of the food than you think and you won't feel overstuffed or sluggish at all, very delicious. Try the sangria and mini sliders.< /review>

Seats were $32.00 and for that you get an easy chair type of seat, adiet coke and a small bag of popcorn. I don't think it's worth the money. Lots of folks ate dinner at their seats and if you're into that then maybe it's worth the money. They did have a fairly extensive menu.< /review>

Pretty cool theatre that offers luxury movie watching experience. They have a restaurant inside where you can dine before or after your movie. You can also order items (food and or beverages) from your theatre seat and have them brought to you. Theatres are moderately sized so, not too big and not too small. Seats are nice and comfy. Plenty of leg room. Prices range from $18-36 per seat. Higher cost seats come with a blanket, pillow, reclining seats and food/drink service. If you are looking for something a step above or exclusive in your movie watching experience, Ipic is where it's at. Oh, and they do validate for parking.</text>

I always really enjoy watching a film at IPic Westwood. It’s really comfy, the staff are friendly and helpful, the food tastes fresh. It’s fun and relaxing to be able to watch a movie and press the button and have someone bring you a drink - whether it’s a cup of tea or a glass of wine!<//review>

<text>I can't think of a better place to watch a movie. Bar and food menu service at your seat. The food and drinks are fantastic to boot. Extremely comfortable seats that fully recline. Blanket and pillow available at your seat. Complimentary popcorn and water. The audio and video in the theater are top notch as well. You're paying more than a regular theater, but it's well worth it< /text>< Pics>

Great experience. They have reclining seats and provide you with a blanket and pillow. There is a variety of food and drinks that you can purchase from your seat throughout the movie. It is pricey but its worth it for the experience. However, I would recommend coming to see those extra long movies to fully enjoy everything they have to offer.</text>

<text>First of all, when people go to movies they are in a hurry to get in because a lot of times they're late especially in West Los Angeles California. The check-in was quick. But the person that I asked to make sure I was a gold member Never follow through with me. I never received an email pertaining to the fact that I asked her please follow up with management for the Goldmember.

Secondly, your bar computer software is Antiquated. It took me literally three minutes for him to give me a simple receipt for a drink I ordered.

Another thing, you're charging way too much for drinks. Isn't it insult enough that we have to pay $36 for two tickets?

Should be able to get a receipt within 30 seconds being the fact that we're in a movie theater trying to get to the show.

Your calamari was terrible in fact it came half Frozen when it finally got there. It was over salty and there is no texture of calamari. I suggest you use a different supplier.

There should be a place on the menu when you're ordering sliders that come with french fries that you can upgrade to truffle french fries if you would like to.

When you're spending that much for a seat you should also have a coat check especially in the winter time when people don't want to cram their beautiful coat into the chair that you're trying to enjoy the comfortability of because you paid so much money for a ticket.

You should Express exactly where parking is and how easy it is to get to the show that you may be running late for or you should suggest to the parking area. Moviegoers can somehow park close especially if they're handicapped and get into the show.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1576035967782, 'text': 'Hi Rich!

High price admission (which includes a blanket and unlimited popcorn) good food (Impossible Buger if your vegetarian), fantastic ambiance (reat bar and food even if you are not there for a movie). Good to go to on a date night maybe just once in your lifetime, otherwise go, to hang in bar/restaurant.</Text>

It is very pricey. And it took us about 30 minutes to find the parking. When we called to ask where the parking was located at no one answered. Once inside food and drinks are off the roof on prices. Good thing it comes with a small complimentary popcorn at least. Would not come back here again though.</Review>

Nice theater in general.
Menu is kind of expensive. There is a little brown blanket and pillow on each chair to make sure you're comfy but I don't think they change them after each use but I' m pretty much sure they're never wash them :)
Parking is complicated, you have to park in the next building parking garage for $3.30 cash. Make sure to memorize your spot otherwise parking employees refuse to take you find your car. They're offer you to take stairs, floor by floor to find your car which is horrible type of customer service to me.
Hey, It's me, you better get a ticket online and make your own experience.
HAVE FUN ;)</review>

Such a GEM of culture and history in this rapidly changing city. It really transports you to different time. The old school theatre still boasts excitement and allure, the small space, incredible movie selection of unique and independent films, and person popping the popcorn at the booth make for a really great movie experience.</text>

Number one you can never get anyone to answer the phone in guest services..I am serious never.  But the most important complaint I have is everytime we order food it's cold in the middle..yuck it really scares me from ordering food.  I ordered the beef skewers on three different occasions and they were cold on the inside, which tells me they are not fresh or worse frozen the  reheated.  My family loves coming to this theater but I am fearful to eat here.  I would love to get the tuna keto but because of my past experiences I fear I will get sick.  You need to address the food at this  theater because it is not good. Recently when we go I just eat the popcorn and nothing else.  Please address this, I would love to be able to order the food.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1573343493203, 'text': "Hi Rebecca. We are sorry to hear about your visit to IPIC.

First time and last time I will be coming to this theater. Paid $64 dollars for 2 adult movie tickets. My sister recommended this theater to me because she said they offered a small pillow, blanket and a small bag of popcorn with your ticket purchase. Well the pillow and blanket were on our seats but we never got the popcorn. I asked twice about it and the employees kept saying that we will get it in a moment. To top it off my recliner seat was broken. 2 stars because the theater itself is nice.<//text>

Great date spot! It costs a good amount more than a normal movie theater, but you get a super comfortable seat and food service.

If you don't want to pay extra, they do have normal movie theater seats at the front at normal movie theater prices.< /Review>

<Text>$64(!!!) for two movie tickets and about 11 pieces of popcorn, sodas are extra. While I want to like this place- because I believe in treating ourselves and enjoying some luxury- I just can't. I simply don't see the value. Now that most other theaters- AMC, Landmark etc- all have great reclining seats here you're basically paying DOUBLE for a blanket (they stopped the pillows) and a sample size taster of popcorn. In fact our seats didn't even have blankets today and the sachets of popcorn (I mean the bags really are provocatively tiny) arrived 30 mins(!) and two presses of the little service button later from our clearly very stressed and overworked server. iPic will tell you that what you're paying for is the option to have food and drinks served to you during the film. But shouldn't that privilege be covered by the cost of the food and drink? It's not as if these things are free, far from it! So really you're paying to be disturbed, and disturb those around you during the movie. The idea of eating these meals also makes a mockery of the fully reclining chair because the two really don't work together. Anyway people seem to like it, I don't get it personally. Maybe they're all so rich they don't have to think about value.<//Text>< gmap_id>

Being at the same location about 3 times in 5 years time frame. The most horrible experience each time. First 2 times just rude front desk people and simply horrible drinks from Tao plus once booked wrong tickets sure we got a refund but we drove all the way to the theater to find out they booked wrong tickets.. Last time (about a month ago) just hit  jack pot where I decided to post a review. I ended up filing a BBB case too and even then still chasing after Sr.General Manager who promised me re-issue a new $100 gift card since the one I was given was hacked and the balance was zeroed out. First initial response was: 'We can't help you...'  that's when a magic place like BBB comes into place but even then nothing worked for this particular business since they just don't care... I even called corporate office and still nothing. Then I decided to txt Sr. Manager since he gave me his card, sure enough my txt went one way then I decided to call hoping I can maybe get another manager on the phone who can help. Yes, 2nd guy ended up being better but then I had to deal with Sr. Manager again who claimed he never got my txt then he said gift card is ready to be picked up this is when I send him my address asking to mail it to me, next he went MIA! So far multiple txt msgs asking to confirm if the card was mailed out since I never got it and again no response. I tried calling Westwood location again 4 days in a row not once they would bother to answer a phone. On top of $100 gift card issue again we had  rude front desk people, another beyond horrible drink from Tao. VIP tickets for over $30 didn't do magic we had to go and pay our order after the movie; they couldn't even run our credit card. Still trying to understand the whole VIP experience seats. I tried to be nice and patient but come on... enough is enough.
I must say next door Arclight for half price of iPic treats you way way better!</text>

If you don't want to sit in the very first two rows, the pricing for normal people doesn't start with a $1 or a $2, at least not from what the ticket desk offered me.

I later noticed the actual ticket price was $18, which was reasonable, so what the hell was the other $12+ for? Fleecing fee and $0.50 worth of popcorn?</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2bc80209dfcc5:0x25bcb202b663fd8e< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Best spot to catch a movie in LA, besides maybe the Soho House or David Geffens pad (just assuming here haha)

Reclining super comfy chairs with pillows & blankets, seat side service plus a great vibe in the bar downstairs.

Show up early & enjoy the vibe, it's a really great one!<//review>

I really enjoy going to movies here. The premium plus seats are really nice and the service is good. It would be nice if they rotated their menu a bit more frequently. Parking costs you about $3.00 if validated. Be sure to validate otherwise, it will be $21. There is a nice bar/restaurant in the main area of the theater. Meet your friends before the movie and hang out.< /Review>

After an impromptu invitation to go and see a movie we decided to check out the iPic Theater which also had the Tuck Room connected to the theater.  The venue did have valet parking but we chose to do the validated parking which was only $3.30 for 4 hours which two me screams a deal compared to other parking places. We came in chose the movie and got the Supreme premium seats and then went over to grab a bite the prices were moderate at the tuck room. the food taste really great and everything paired Well together and you could tell that most of the drinks and the items on the menu have been thought out very well.

Our server then informed us that we were allowed to enter the theater 30 minutes before our show and that we could also order in the theater because of the premium seats and that these seats also came with complimentary popcorn.

The service was absolutely stellar we ordered chocolate chip toffee cookies french fries sliders and the complementary popcorn was really crunchy and fresh but kind of salty.

The movie theater held about 75 seats if even that. It was divided into two different sections Gray section and the yellow sections the yellow seats were recliners that came with a blanket and a little pillow of which you could also order food to be delivered to you from the yellows seated area.  The food came really quick and was really tasty along with the service they were moving in with ease without interrupting the movies for other.

Overall we had a great experience the bathroom was really spacious and it was also unisex there was also a convenient bar outside of the theater of which the bartender gave us some of the chef's on complimentary mixed nuts.

Just go check it out it's worth every bit of it we will definitely return.

Because I definitely. Would "Pic" this theater again, LOL see what I did there.< /text>

The seats were very comfy despite being in the economy section. Staff was very friendly and food was delcious. Only reason I dont give a 5 was because my seat in the economy section was not wiped down (there was a half-squeezed lime on the table) while the luxury seats clearly had had a lot of attention to look nice.< /Text>

Simply put, watching a movie here is an experience. It's really fun getting popcorn passed out to you at your seat or having food and drinks brought to you so you can eat in the middle of the movie. Enjoy Reclining almost completely flat in the chair and under the blanket. The real challenge is to stay awake for the whole movie. If you order food/ drink Expect it to cost about $100 for two though @@<//Review>

Really love seeing movies here during the week. You get the couch recliner seating, free popcorn,  a pillow and a blanket. It's hard to see movies elsewhere with the experience that's so good here! Easy to buy tickets ahead of time using the app or website, and it's priced pretty well compared to what it costs to see a movie these days, and the comfortable atmosphere along with free popcorn makes it worth it. Definitely a solid place to go for a date night.< /Review>

This place was awesome the staff was super friendly I was definitely looking like a scumbag with t shirt flip flops and shorts on as I didn't expect it to be such an upscale theater but everyone treated me great. This is a must stop theater!! Also I work in the TV and Film Industry, the sound and viewing experience was awesome!<//text>

I don't mind paying extra for the experience but would appreciate better customer service from the ticket sales, web side. Left multiple messages on email and by voicemail. Not possible to deal with a human. Good theatre as long as there isn't a problem buying a ticket or using  the website</text>

<Text>I had to truly say, today as I treated my best friend to a movie night & being her first time to this location the service was just bad... I been here every other Thursday night for movie night with my boyfriend & had never felt this way. From waiting to get serve or even ask if we needed a drink at the bar table to waiting for the check. It was a hassle to actually get a drink and yet being  there siting in the bar table. I wasn’t really happy with tonight’s service overall, from the outside bar to the service inside the theater I don’t know, my past visits have always  been easy going and just perfect...I’m just disappointed that my best friends first time here wasn’t what I wanted it to be for her.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Best theatre ever! Very comfortable, great service, free popcorn and great food and drink menu, even fried chicken. 3D was great at this theatre. We sat in last row and it was perfect, Very small theatre where every premium seat is good. Off the hook, only advise is to put watermelon on the menu!< /Text>

Unlimited [good] popcorn, quick service, courteous staff. The theatre itself has top-notch sound and picture quality. There is no 3d here, but I imagine that would make ordering and eating/drinking a challenge and that is their main profit center.</text>< pictures>

<Review>The movie watching experience was, of course, wonderful with the comfortable, reclining, armchair-style chairs and the food service.  However, what really made it great was that they were very willing to go off-menu to accommodate for our food allergies.  It allowed us all to enjoy the full 'premium plus' experience there.</Review><UserId.>110696070166004344271<//UserId.>< rating>

<Text>I love this place, it's just the best way to experience a movie. You're not squeezed in next to someone else like in a regular theatre, you have your own soft leather recliner with a pillow and small blanket and they bring you a free bag of tasty popcorn and waiters come to your seat so you don't have stand in a concession line. The menu choices rival a decent restaurant and you order alcoholic drinks as well. They have a Westwood and Pasadena location. Typical ticket price is from $22 to $29 but it's worth it to occasionally do it. They do movie going right!< /Text><Date>1489490646205< /Date>< user_name>

<Text>They seem to having a hard time operating normally right now. Went on a Saturday night and they didn’t have any butter for the popcorn. I asked a few times for the machine to be refilled and was told there was none in the building. Had to eat Very dry popcorn.
Limited menu at the restaurant as they are using the movie theater kitchen. Boyfriend said the men’s restroom was a mess.
Got the impression things were not running very smoothly. Disappointed with my experience.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I brought my wife here to see Into the Woods. This was easily one of the best movie theater experiences I've ever had. We bought the premium seats with the pillow, blanket, unlimited popcorn and full service dining. It was awesome. While it was not cheap (especially when factoring in the food cost as well), I think this will be our go-to movie theater for date nights.<//review>

If you have never been here, then I would recommend visiting at least once.  Great place for a date night for both dinner and a move, maybe even some drinks.  You can get dressed up and feel right at home.  No screaming kids, hoodlums, etc.</text>

<Text>I am a huge fan of the iPIC, I mean a huge one, especially of the exclusivity of the venues however, this location lacks in standard! I have visited multiple iPIC locations including Chicago (Bolingbrook-Promenade) and Houston (Galleria) both of these locations were put together a lot better than this location. It’s not that this location didn’t have symptoms of being an iPIC because it did but this location was dated and not as clean as the aforementioned locations.

The movie I saw was Avengers Endgame (Great Movie by the way) that in itself was fine; but the presentation of the auditorium as well as the blanket located in the premium seats (that cost a premium) was lacking. Not to mention you had to pay $3.50 to park and that is even with validate parking from the theater; I get it, I truly get it it’s SoCal, but come one! Lastly, the location was in what appeared to be a business district, shame on me for not doing enough research prior to booking two tickets. Service was fine, the staff was solid and so was the food! The details I covered above are a personal bother, I guess.

Until next time GoogleFam!

< Review>
I had an amazing experience. They have very comfortable seats, excellent service, and delicious food. The best part was the price though; with all these features one would assume that this theater might be expensive but in reality that it's not the case. The price of the ticket itself was exactly the sane as a regualer theater and the price of the food is also fair, your bill might increase only if you order alcoholic beverages, but then that would be expected any where. In short: I'm hooked<//Review>

<review>Last year, the day after the Nipsey Hussel VL concert in Hollywood at the Palladium.

Nipsey, Lauren, BH and myself. Watched the Black Panther matinée together. It was Nipsey's who chose IPIC! What I personally like about IPIC Theatre has everything to do with the way they make every customer feel like they're the owner of the location.

IPIC also has a dinner and drinks menu, with waiters to go along with that additional extra added feature. I simply loved the Black Panther DC Comic Motion Picture at IPIC with my close friends. This theatre has a special vibe and cosiness to it 🤓👍<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Best part: every seat in theatre is a good seat and you can reserve seats.

I was under the impression after talking to the cashier that the tickets were $18, which seemed spendy to me, a visiting senior who usually pays 5-7 bucks for a first-run matinee movie at home. I have a ticket that says the "PremPlus"  seat cost 18 dollars, but my credit card was charged $32. I haven't been able to get guest services to answer the phone, so I am going to talk to my credit card company and see if I can get them to contest it. The seats were definitely comfy, but no more so than the ones in my local theaters in Eugene, OR, and Palm Springs, CA. Those seats cost between 5 and 7 dollars for senior matinees with reclining reserved seats on certain days of the week, one including free popcorn. I will not be returning to this theatre!<//Review>

< Review>
Got the premium members only price for $18.00 comes with popcorn and table service.  I didn't get either one. I asked twice. They had one person serving all the theaters. Poor management. After an hour and forty minutes it was embarrassing.  Nothing. Popcorn was paid for so can help but feel totally ripped off.  So I left knowing I'll never go back. AMC will give you a much better experience for half the price.<//Review>

<Review>Bathroom was dirty. How are there soooo many nasty and disgusting women out there? Is that how they keep their homes 😒. Scottsdale, AZ iPic, got them beat 100%. In order to improve a work environment, hire staff that will care for the establishment as if they own it.</Review>< Pictures>

The review is for the film I saw called don't shoot I am the guitar man written by a Sebastopol local buzzy Martin.  Buzzy for many year has used music to help children and adults find a deeper expression of life.  The film is centered on his work at San Quentin and life challenged youth.<//text>

For a Bad-time, I mean really an expensive Bad time, Drop by! This place is suffering from Mass-confusion, the servers are bunch of snobby inexperienced amateurs as well. The only reason to go there is if you are purposely looking to had a Bad-time, broken heads, getting into fights and getting into trouble. Perfect otherwise.<//Text>

<Review>I have a 2 year old daughter and don't see movies as often as I used to. Last night my wife and I bought Friday afternoon tickets for Wonder Woman. I took the afternoon off of work. We got a bite to eat and then coffee in Westwood Village. I brought my backpack with a laptop so I could write before the movie. When we arrived at the theater they wouldn't let us in because I had backpack. I told the ticket lady she or her manager could look through it, but that was their rule and she wouldn't budge. I couldn't put it in my car as suggested because I live a mile away and I walk. There wouldn't be enough time for me to walk home and back to catch the movie. There was no compromise, so we had to get a refund. I wasted a day off. Thanks iPic. I won't step foot in your establishment again.</Review>< Pictures>

I LOVE iPic.  I'm so happy they opened a location in westwood - which is a bit closer to us then Pasadena.  Can we get one up in the valley now?! :)

The tickets are expensive but for a great date night when you know the movie will be good this is the place to go.

Spend the extra $10 and go for the fully reclining seats.  You get free unlimited popcorn, a pillow, and a blanket too.

The theaters are small and there isn't a bad seat in the house.  This is also a very fun place to go to with a big group of friends.

Come with your appetite. The food is also amazing.  We partook in lobster rolls and a panini.  The portions are small while the price is still high BUT the food was very good and had great quality.  We also realized that they probably want to serve small/normal portions so that you aren't uncomfortable or having to leave during the movie.

If you like alcohol, get the Marilyn Monroe lemonade!</text>

This is the best theater on the westside. Food and drinks served during the movie. My only complaint is that it's starting to have that dusty movie theater smell now that I hate. It needs renovation to justify the price. I will still go back but if they don't reupholster and recarpet it's not going to be worth it soon.< /review>

Nice little cinema screen - it was completely packed for our movie and because we bought tickets last minute we were consigned to the front two rows, the equivalent of cattle class with no reclining chairs and no at-seat dinner service. In other words, book your experience ahead of time to make the most of this fine venue!<//text>

<Review>iPic has ruined movies in LA for me.  In the sense that I I refuse to go absolutely anywhere else to see a film...  I know there's other upscale super comfy theaters in LA, but to me iPic is the best.

Being a Sapphire member (a paid membership, worth every penny) gets you pretty clutch deals like pre-release tickets before anyone else, allowing me to secure myself some great seats to the most popular new releases.

Tuesdays are also member happy hour nights, with drink and food specials.

During the week, member prices are beyond reasonable, $18 a seat.  Equal to or better than any "regular" theater in LA.  Weekends however prices get jacked up pretty high, so I tend to stick to mid-week showings.  You also get free popcorn!!

The restaurant and bar (Tanzy) are also pretty on point.

Go, and you will never want to go elsewhere for a movie again.<//Review>< pictures>

Expensive movie tickets but you get what you pay for. I'd much prefer enjoying a movie at ipic with the comfort of the seats and a drink. Seems like it's the way of the future in the age of huge flat screens in every house.</text>

<text>Its expensive for a movie theater but it's got great amenities. There is a bar and restaurant in the lobby, seat side service with recliners, and a nice enough screen and sound system. I was a little annoyed they didn't have prices posted on their site. $17 to sit too close and $30 for normal seating and waiters. I think maybe the price changes based on movie and time of day which is why it's not posted.< /text>< Pictures>

Over priced for the experience.  If you're looking to impress a date, definitely splurge for the premium plus seats over the base premium seats.  The base seats require you to strain you neck quite a bit.</review>

As a frequent visitor to iPic in Westwood, I really enjoy the premier plus seats
It's a comfortable environment away from the television screen
Everything about this place is 10/10 what really bothers me is that this is a high class place but almost always do not carry full inventory of drinks
As well as alcohol they only carry cheap whiskey and beer
I think they should definitely bring in more drinks to provide for the upscale people that come here< /Review>

<review>iPic had been on my list of LA things to do for a while, and I am so glad I finally went.

We arrived about 10 minutes before the movie we wanted to watch, to find it had been sold out. They fortunately had another movie we wanted to watch for a showtime about 40 minutes later. We had a comfortable wait in Tuck Room Tavern, examining the menu. No one bothers you to ask if you're going to order; they seem to understand that you may be waiting.

The cinema for your film opens about 30 minutes before the movie starts. I would recommend arriving early, given you get a chance to look at the menu and get comfortable with the chair, the blanket, and the pillow.

I loved it! Definitely on the expensive side, but what a great movie watching experience. Drinks and food were delicious, with unlimited popcorn. We ordered the homemade ginger beer, which was mango-habanero. Also loved the el corazon margarita (with pomegranate), and the truffle fries!

Service was very responsive. Granted, we were in the back where waiters could see us easily. Overall, may not do again because of the price but absolutely loved it.<//review><Rating>4<//Rating><Time>1481581810261<//Time>< user_name>

Very nice and very expensive. But if you're willing to dish out the cash, this theater has amazing decor, delicious food, and the comfiest seats you will ever watch a movie in. Think of it as the next step above Arclight.< /Review>

<review>Interesting and expensive place to see a movie. Reserved seating and premium seats are more like Lazy Boy loungers than anything else.  Full menu, bar, and waiter service on the premium seats.</review>< Pictures>

While I like the theater as a venue, I wonder what their concept is, if any. The tickets are much more expensive than in Westwood in general, so I would guess they are aiming at the non-college costumers. But the movies they do play seem aimed at a fairly dumb audience. If they would show movies even marginally based to Wilshire corridor folks, they could make a killing. But if they continue to show trash I am afraid they will be out of business soon.<//Review>

<review>The trouble with iPic is that people think they are in their own homes and so have no regards for the other people around them.  Tonight, two adults came into the VIP section late with 6-7 school-age children during the opening credits.  They were noisy but did settle down.  At the end of the movie credits, the adults allowed the children to jump, run and dance in front of the screen, wrap themselves in the theater drapes, and crawl in and out of the drapes under the screen.  The adults thought the behavior was okay because it was the end credits, not thinking that there are people who like to read the credits, look at the art work, listen to the music and see if there are any extra scenes at the end.  This is the second time that there was a problem in the theater and there was no staff that knew about it.  It's like a black hole.  Needless to say, I left before I credits were  finished.  Not my favorite place to see a movie</review>< Pictures>

I'd never been to one of these dine-in movie theaters but a very generous friend invited me out for an evening of movie pampering and I was excited to check it out! It sure isn't cheap (we even got the upgraded deluxe seats for $10 extra, woohoo), but I believe you get your money's worth in smoothly reclining leather seats, blanket and pillow, bag of popcorn, and chairside wait service for food and drinks. The food was good (if not outstanding) in my opinion (we tried their hummus plate and a flatbread pizza), but the service was great, from the ticket people to the wait staff, everyone was uniformly friendly and solicitous. I was also impressed with the luxe decor and sophisticated art on the walls--it's got a great ambiance. This is definitely one of those "Treat. Yo. Self." places and I'll be sure to return on occasion when I just don't feel like dealing with the rabble.<//review>

I've been to both AMC and IPic and I love them both for different reasons. I loved being treated as  an adult  and not just another movie goer at the IPic. Nice leather recliners. A wonderful glass of wine.  Most importantly, the quiet; no rustling of popcorn. Yes, AMC is cheaper, but it's just a movie house. IPic is so much more. I am willing to pay the extra price for the service, and adult atmosphere when I can afford to do so.<//text>

Okay, so I resisted giving just one star, based on the fact that I really used to love the iPic in Westwood. It used to be a 4-5 star experience and worth the extra money. Sadly, the iPic Westowwod location seems to be off the rails these days.

I was there with my girlfriend to see Cinderella on Sunday 4/12/15. As a Sapphire member, I would expect to be notified by email if there are any significant changes to the perks of membership. So I was quite surprised to learn that the self-parking fee was no longer covered for members when I arrived to check in for the movie. Seriously? When did this happen? This is not a good sign when the parking fee can no longer be covered as a membership benefit. Especially when you consider how much more it costs for the experience itself! Once we arrived to our seats, we were surprised to find no iPad/tablet at all, just the fixture that used to hold it! Instead, there was an actual menu sitting on the table. This is how it was at the very beginning when this location first opened, so it seems like things are regressing! What is even worse, is that these obviously old menus don't even list everything that had been listed in the tablet system. As a beer drinker, I know they offer that, but it was nowhere to be found on the menu. Worst of all, is the obvious decline in service once you get to your seat. That is really the whole point of paying extra for an iPic experience. Sure, the reclining chairs with the blanket and pillow are nice, but without prompt service, the experience is ruined. In the past we received fast service and there appeared to be more than one server working in the theater. On this occasion there seemed to be just one server working the entire theater. There seemed to be one other person that only delivered popcorn. Needless to say, it took forever for the server to finally get to us. By this point we had lost our desire to order any food since we could not trust when it would actually arrive so we settled for beer and wine instead. When the popcorn arrived, the quality was clearly not as good as we had remembered from past experiences and it was very salty! I could not enjoy my popcorn because I had to wait so long for my first drink to arrive.

This is not the iPic experience that I have come to expect. I am now seriously considering how I can cancel my membership and I am seriously doubting whether or not I want to shell out the extra money ($50 for the two CInderella tickets) in the future. So sad to see such a great concept run in to the ground in our neighborhood. I also tried contacting via the website, but have yet to hear back. :(</review>

Want to sit in a lazy boy chair and sip a glass of wine while you watch a feature film? You've found the right place. And tickets are actually cheaper here than they are at the regular old AMC down the street!<//review>

This is a excellent small movie theater. The Premium Plus seats is an experience and it will be hard for me to go to a regular theater and enjoy a movie.<//Review>

< Review>
I go to a lot of iPic theaters.  This one is OK.  If you are in LA and you don't want to make the drive to Pasadena,  then I guess this is the closest iPic near you.  Unfortunately the staff, service and upkeep of this one doesn't compare to their other locations around the country, especially Pasadena.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) An innocent and pretty idea for a cinema. Comfortable seats (like a business class of an airline). That's all. An elegant entrance that does not give the slightest idea of ​​a cinema. No indication and no staff to guide you. If this is the first time you go get ready to make do and have to take care of retrieving information / directions. The waiters are not very efficient and the organization in general can be improved. From the advertising they do I expected more. Or maybe I'm used to my reality, our services and feeling more pampered ... even at lower prices.

(Original)
Idea innotivativa e carina per un cinema. Sedili comodi (come una business class di una compagnia aerea). Tutto qui. Ingresso elegante che però non dà minimamente l'idea di un cinema. Nessuna indicazione e nessun personale addetto a fare da guida. Se è la prima volta che andate preparatevi ad arrangiarvi e a dover occuparvi di recuperare le informazioni/indicazioni. I camerieri non effecientissimi e l'organizzazione in generale può essere migliorata. Dalla pubblicità che fanno mi aspettavo di più. O forse sono abituata alla mia realtà, ai nostri servizi e a sentirmi più coccolata... Anche a prezzi inferiori.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The truth is disappointment, except the comfortable chairs are not worth the price, small screen and the food is paid

<review>(Translated by Google) It's good, but it's a little expensive, but they don't let the bag in. I don't know why ... the service is not bad. Very comfortable, $ 29 for a piece.
