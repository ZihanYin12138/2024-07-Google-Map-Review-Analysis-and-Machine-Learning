The best part of this place is the name and the red exterior, distinctive and easy to find.  It loses from there on.  Sparse on decor, loud music on poor speakers and a lot of merch on shelves and taking up almost a full booth..

We shouldn't have tried the Chinese chicken salad here.  We know better, there's a Mexican vibe and nothing else Asian on the menu.  Nice chunks of white meat chicken, fresh greens, and some very tiny fried noodles.  Add a little plastic cup of Mandarin oranges and a decent sauce without a lot of excitement. Passable but nothing special.<//text>

I had to Google the ingredients and ask the cashier. He confirmed and quickly fixed the situation! I loved that!! He spoke to the kitchen and had them make 2 special cocktails for me. He had glasses and was working the register. Please forgive me, I forgot his name. His customer service made our experience enjoyable and memorable!</review>< gmap_id>

There is something on the menu for everyone even the kitties. The place is beautifully decorated and feels somewhat like a diner ish. The hours have been fluctuating because of the pandemic and have been closed multiple times so be sure to call or go online to check their hours to make sure that they are open. They also have an indoor bar but will remain closed until the pandemic is over. But they do serve cocktails on the sidewalk. Have fun all day baby and Silver Lake!< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5Q760o4nj7V8eQOGb7VXaqckcOl3_2ka3b9fW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWDfHtXUuf7lqEhvIOBSqzYmTFebvvqnP8fh7s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8adZnEgxiTmNLLsA8cJnQ3JFKB76JcNP2fGad=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNvmJOKTkFG0q0lpKpwwcBqMnddy5wAvjBG-0X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2c73f4c3e2737:0x177630ebc52bd06d<//gmapID></record>

Went in expecting a great breakfast but left disappointed. Ordered the biscuit sandwich, fries and no drink and it came out to $25?! Would be one thing if it was worth it but sorry to say it’s not.< /Text>

I kept hearing about this place but had yet to visit. I love me a solid breakfast sandwich and all day makes one on a biscuit with jam. Finally got around to trying it today and was really surprised how huge it was. Clearly a home made biscuit which was super rich and good. This breakfast biscuit isn't messing around. Toasttab can be expensive so pick up recommended.<//review>

Incredible, I had the wedge salad and chicken sandwich, both were outstanding, the salad was so fresh and the soft eggs were prefect! The chicken sandwich was, out of ALL the chicken sandwiches in LA now, definitely in my top 3! So juicy with every bite, breading and seasoning to perfection, I opted out of the pimento cheese which I feel was a huge mistake, so I'll be having another one with the cheese very soon! I'm really looking forward to trying their loco moco and the dessert box, both of which are in my immediate future, I'm really excited to explore this menu as soon as i can! Ordering on their website and the drive up take out was so easy, food was ready as soon as we got there and they were all so friendly, I highly recommend All Day Baby!<//review>

The ABD biscuit sandwich is phenomenal and the BEST biscuits I've had in LA since leaving North Carolina. Their pumpkin spice bread is what my pumpkin dreams are made of.< /review>

Great sandwiches. I've tried the ADB biscuit sando with bacon / sausage, LT's Hot Catfish sando, and the fried chicken sando, and I'd recommend any or all of them. Now I just need to try the pastries...< /review>

Big fan of HLAY-- ADB is definitely at the same standard of quality and service. Wonderful selection of sandwiches and drinks. The owner is very kind. Contactless payment only. Everything is very clean and social distanced. Very happy with my first time dining out since the pandemic. Thank you!</review>

<gmap_id>0x80c2c73f4c3e2737:0x177630ebc52bd06d</gmap_id><rating>4</rating><review>In a city full of decades-old Diners it takes something special to make a splash in the genre, and at All Day Baby Chefs Jonathan Whitener and Thessa Diadem of Here’s Looking At You execute a melting pot menu with one-part precision and another whimsy.

Perhaps better described as “all American,” Los Angeles in particular drawing from broad cultural references across its ever-growing expanse, it was late-November 2019 that All Day Baby opened doors on Sunset, original hours from 8:00am until 3:00pm recently expanded to 10:00pm on Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday plus an hour later Friday and Saturday.

Situated in Silver Lake, Managing Partner Lien Ta responsible for an all-female service team that works efficiently with perpetual smiles, it is immediately upon entry to the 2,000 square foot space that guests feel a sense of ease, close-set seating responsible for sometimes high volume but the style of booths nonetheless providing privacy.

Dividing Bar from dining area, with bakery cases up-front offering added temptation, it was as a party of six that diners cut a wide swath through All Day Baby’s diverse offerings, Cold Brew Coffee and a classic Soda Shop Shake flavored by Pistachio plus self-service Water accompanying two soft-centered Cookies, a rich Blackout Brownie and one of four daily Concha that justifies its $6 cost with a housemade Jam center.

Trotting the globe for ingredients such as Vadouvan and Halvah, the latter creating a crunchy exterior for one of the aforementioned Cookies while the other teams with Apple Butter and Dukkah to yield exemplary Carrots, fans of “Chicken + Waffles” will not find them on All Day Baby’s menu, but rather a Buckwheat Waffle intended to be dragged through Butter and topped with housemade Ham plus a ubiquitous Fried Chicken Sandwich made better by Salt & Pepper Mayo plus spicy Pimento Cheese.

Further challenging conformity with French Toast, the Pineapple Jam, Rum Butter and crunchy Cereal dancing harmoniously while Smoked Maple Syrup is best added in small portions, those seeking even better “Bread” will find it offered by way of Mama May, her Banana slice more cake-like and made all the more enthralling by Ricotta, Honey and toasted Buckwheat.

Skipping everyday stacks for a single Hotcake, toothsome and golden beneath Fruit, Nuts and creamy Cheese that makes Syrup largely unnecessary, Buttermilk Biscuits are well-crafted but not revelatory, leaving Shrimp and Grits more room to shine in the spotlight beneath a fried Egg and crispy Leeks that play well off the “Bolognese.”

Not about to skip Dessert, Pie picked over Sundaes or Sticky Buns, All Day Baby’s intention to “illicit glee and satisfaction” is completed by a Marshmallow Sandwich that spins childhood memories on their head thanks to gooey Praline filling while a Banana Cream wedge sweetened by Dulce de Leche threatens Emeril Lagasse for best in the business.< /review><user>102310126330311462271<//user>< name>

Visiting from out of town and not sure where to take your family? Go here! Big portions. Mom & Pop shop. Quality food.
We ordered too much, but ate it all anyway.
The home fries were the best!!
This was our favorite place in LA and we had at least 10 restaurants under our belt.</review>

<text>My wife and I split a sweet dish and a savory dish for Sunday breakfast. The chicken fried steak is not your usual sad Salisbury steak. This is a perfectly medium-rare flank steak with a delicious gravy and a not-too-heavy breading. French toast is stuffed with pineapple jam and topped with toasted coconut and cinnamon crumbles and a rum butter. It’s served with smoked maple syrup as if you could make it any better than it already is. Service is friendly and easy-going. Physical space is beautifully designed. Just a wonderfully chill, laid-back environ for a Sunday (or any day) breakfast.<//text>< pics>

<review>Great diner style restaurant offering American breakfast and lunch classics with a modern twist. A few vegetarian options, a couple of vegan things. Our food was slightly over-seasoned but all in all a great meal and wonderful service.< /review>< gmapID>

<Review>We ordered biscuits from the biscuit window after many weeks of trying but missing the opportunity! Given how quickly they sell out of the chicken biscuit, we had high hopes for this one. The biscuit was great, buttery; chicken was very nicely fried. I didn’t love the pickles but my boyfriend did, so maybe it’s just a preference thing— I definitely prefer a dill pickle to a sweet one. However, all in all, I’d say $16 is a steep price to pay for this chicken biscuit. I get that is just part of the area’s “charm,” and hip restaurants can charge what they want. Although it was very good, I probably won’t be going back.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I loved it! Friendly staff, which is so nice to find in these trying times. I had the breakfast biscuit, which I wasn’t sure I would like. I’m  very particular about a good biscuit. And the fact that they are adding jam to cheese and eggs made me nervous. But...this was Dee-Lish!!!  I don’t mind spending a couple extra bucks for a sandwich that’s simple and great. Every restaurant LA is overpriced these days. Even the mediocre hole in the wall places who are still knocking off “avocado toast” are 30-50% more than cafes in SF and Portland (which are cheap and amazing, as a rule). So when I find a one-off neighborhood spot that is locally owned and offers tasty eats with high quality ingredients, I’m gonna support that! I’m not going to write a review that says  “great food, very tasty, but it’s not ‘almost free’ so I won’t go back”, and then leave 3 stars only because your cheap and selfish...like some others have posted. Thanks everyone at ADB! Keep it up and you’ve got a loyal customer in me.</review>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>I can’t believe they don’t have  Apple Pay functionality or the small square card reader you see in most stories. You have to scan the barcode and manually input your car information. Too much paper and time being wasted in their checkout protocols.

The chicken biscuit sandwich, Jack-Daniel/coke float and the apple pie were delicious.
However, I was so disappointed with their AAD burrito. It was too cheesy. The texture reminded me of Taco Bell’s and Hot pocket’s burritos.

Overall, I believe this restaurant is a bit overhype. The bill came out to $80 for two people and it wasn’t worth it. They should definitely improve on their checkout process.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Very interesting combinations of flavors. Great ingredients, great flavors but not sure that their artistic way of putting the food together is the best. We got the adb sandwich and the french toast. The white american cheese and the strawberry jam where not the best two pieces to put to on this sandwich. However the biscuit was awesome. The french toast was basically a pineapple upside-down cake with coconut topper and a smoky syrup. All of the flavors were good just too many happening at one time.<//Text>

Went here because of the "Worth It" episode by BuzzFeed on YouTube and they didn't have the two items they talked about in the video. I got the Barbacoa burrito which was good and the meat was smoked but nothing to drive out of your way for. My friend got a regular chocolate milkshake and it costed $11... It was completely plan chocolate with whip cream, no toppings, no syrups or anything. You can get the same shake at a fast food stop for a few bucks.
Overall it was good but I was disappointed.< /review>

<text>Overall very good food. I wouldn't say the food was a good value, a little expensive, but that's to be expected for a trendy place in Silverlake.  I really enjoyed the chicken biscuit and sandwiches, along with the banana bread. The chicken fried steak looked really good, but the batter got soggy really quick and that steak had that flavor of a steamed piece of beef. The banana cream pie was meh for me, but my friends really liked it; however, we got a chocolate hazelnut pie for pi day (3/14) and it was one of the best pies I've ever had.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>Great food, great atmosphere.  Love trying out something new on the menu each time I come back.  Favorites are the breakfast sandwich, beet salad, beef and cheese, white bean dip, pretty much any smoked meat and the michelada cocktail.  And then a concha and a coffee to go.<//Review>< pics>

For example, the Chicken Biscuit comes plain for $14. They ask you if you’d like cheese and hot sauce - I said sure, this was a $3 up charge. They gave me a sample size amount of hot sauce. $17 for a decent biscuit/chicken sandwich is asking a bit much. We also got a biscuit sandwich and added bacon.. also $17. The biscuit on that sandwich fell apart the first bite. Plus they charge you a 3% kitchen fee.. plus you tip on counter service. Two biscuit sandwiches with no sides and the bare minimum on them for over $40.00 is absolutely absurd.<//Text>< pics>

The main guy Joe helped me with an engine for a 08 honda odyssey, I mistakenly got an i-vtec and needed a regular Vtec engine. He helped me exchange it for the right one. Helped me out a lot, engine runs great no problems.<//review>

<Review>My friend recommended this place because he bought his 6 speed sti swap from here few months ago. I haven't bought anything from this shop but stopped by recently to check out what they had. Nick were incredibly friendly and super knowledgeable. The prices seemed more than fair and they had an incredible amount of motors and parts. HUGE INVENTORY at least 500 motors in stock ! I will for sure buy my STi swap from this swap.</Review>< Pics>

Repeat customer here, dealt with Nick multiple times. Very professional. I ordered my 06 STI front end and recently i just ordered the 6 speed drive train package. Very satisfied with the purchase. Quality parts at very good price.<//text>

<Review>Nick have been very helpful, communication is superb and our motor run like new. My dad and I drove from Sacramento to pick up a motor for our Toyota Tundra 2002. The drive was worth it. Super clean motor inside and outside. My dad doesn't speak English but thanks to Nick, he explained everything in Spanish. Good customer service. He showed us all his inventory and my DAD pick up the one he liked. Clean shop ! I will recommend to anyone. Thanks man!<//Review>< pics>

I called and spoke to Nick about a 13B twin turbo swap. I asked for additional pictures of the actual motor and received by email. Quick response and good communication. I drove from San Diego to LA and finally saw the item in person. I was amazed. Quick tour of the shop. This place was packed all the way to the roof. Motors and motors. I Never saw a big place like that. Nick was very honest and explained that the motor has low compression. He work out on the price and I was more then happy. Appreciate the honesty ! Anyways I was rebuilding that motor. They helped me to loaded the motor in my truck. Thank you !<//text>

I called and spoked to Nick regarding a 2010 Subaru Outback motor. I was told by another shop the early version of EJ25 will work into my car but wasn’t true. Nick took the time to explain everything before I bought. He also recommended a local mechanic shop and the engine was swap in 2 days. Knowledgeable staff and good quality engine at fair price.< /text>

He asked for another motor and we gave him. Suddenly, he called his buddy over the phone and then he starts teaching him where to see on the block if that the right one. I have showed him on the cylinder head that’s the number you are looking for? he starts arguing and saying you dont know about motors. We didn’t want to argue with him, so I asked his dad to tell him to sit in the car we want to talk to a mature and comprehensive person. Hes dad tell me what if we install and the engine don’t start. I propose hes dad we have a local mechanic shop that install motors and they will take care. They refused. At this point there’s nothing we can do.'}</Response>
<review>This place is trash, if your a Honda enthusiast don’t waste your time coming here, they don’t have any knowledge on any sort of Honda motors. Really bad customer service as well. The dude is really disrespectful. For sure don’t recommend this place and will never go here again!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< UserId.>

These guys are incredible! I drove to their shop to pick up a Rb26 motor from San Francisco . When I showed up the motor looked even better in person. Great swap. Great compression. This folks are legit. They answered all my questions and take times to show they inventory. I will recommend to everyone.<//Review>

I would not recommend this place I went with my dad and bought a motor from them and they said it was good and I would have no issues with it my mechanic who has been doing all our cars for years did the work and put in the motor and the motor is no good everything in my car is working but the motor is no good and because of the limited time of exchange or return on the receipt they couldn't do anything and my mechanic spoke to them and we can't return it or exchange they suck.< /text>

I purchased a CA18det engine on September 1st from Nick Rehm smooth transaction until I paid for the motor then he said that they’re no warranty on nothing else but the motor and transmission and if I didn’t agree he wouldn’t send the motor.the motor came in incomplete missing the MAF sensor, cut engine harness bad coil, bad ignitor I had to source parts internationally. He didn’t want to extend my warranty. The motor finally starts, but it smokes a lot. Has a bad turbo too. Wouldn’t recommend buying any turbo engines from them.< /text>

{'time': 1604987351934, 'text': "hello Dear Jessica ,\nWe are sorry to hear that .\nwe never mentioned that motor has no warranty , please check your invoice  that were  sent before you have committed to purchase .it is mentioned clearly that motor has limited 30 days warranty on head and block . it is a 30 years old motor .\nno external part is under warranty , this is very typical warranty type that's is been common all over the place that deals with used auto parts  .\nBefore the motor was purchased we did our best to  show you the condition of the motor like photos, live compression test video clip .\nbasic  accessories  were included to this package like wire and ecu , but mass air flow sensor  were not part of the deal .\nwe did not have this part in stock .\nwe have got an email from you recently ( after 30 days ) asking for the warranty extension , which your warranty has been already expired .\nour terms and condition requires the client to report any problem within 30 days , if within warranty time frame we were informed  we could have found a solution .\nplease accept our apologies ."}<//response>

Great Importer ! These guys are top notch in the industry. I bought my V7 STi front clip and couldn’t be more happy. The clip came with everything. My motor and drive train run like a new car. Body panels are in excellent condition for a 18 years old car. Highly recommend this place over a lot of other JDM place in California. These guys have the quality and quantity. Big warehouse full of parts. Great selection of wheels.This spot is Legit! Keep the great work guys I will for sure be a return client for my next project. Thanks !</text>

I was in search of a front and rear subframe for my R32 GTR. I saw a listing that they had and called to confirm it's availability. I spoke with Nick, who was able to confirm that the item was in-stock and advised me to come and take a look at it. Once I was there, Nick showed me everything (and even gave me a tour of the shop, very cool). He allowed me to take as much time as I needed to make sure it was what I needed. We even talked about cars in general, which was pretty cool. I'll definitely be back in the future when I need things for my GTR. Thanks again Nick.</Text>

< Review>
I bought my Rb26 from Nick at JDM California motors in Los Angeles. Great experience. I went 2 times before purchasing the motors and he was always very friendly and let me walk inside the shop. Legit jdm store. Everyone make sure to hit these guys up for your RBs swap. They have a huge selection and good price.< /Review>

<review>JDM California motors is the perfect place to get your used motor! The entire procedure was stress free and the service is impeccable.  The owner is straightforward. They answered all my questions before i bought my 2jz swap. Pics and videos of the actual swap was sent quickly thru email and it was an easy transaction.  Very friendly customer service. Make sure to hit these guys up for your project , they are the real deal !</review>< resp>

Great service and products from this company! Nick was very patient with me and answered all my questions.  I bought a few months ago a K20 typeR swap and a B18C Gsr long block. Both swap was perfectly described. I asked more
Pics and received. Fast communication, Easy transaction, well packed , great swap,
This is a good importer.
Ask for Nick , he’s the man!< /Review>

<text>Bought a V9 sti Ej207 motor and gear box along with some brembo brakes and axles from Nick at JDM California motors. It was one of the cleanest swap that I have ever ordered for my clients car. The engine is running great.
Had a great experience with Nick very responsive to all my questions and provided frequent updates on my order along with pictures. This is one of the best importer of JDM in USA. Great company ! I will for sure contact again for any other swap. Thanks<//text>< pics>

Everyone in SoCal should buy from this shop. Great motors. I bought a B18c typer from Nick a while back ago and recently bought a k24 from my dad TSX and couldn’t be more happy. They deserve 6/5. Honest and humble peoples at this shop. Called a few others jdm shop around LA and they don’t care about you they only want you money. Nick will treat you good. Peoples please give your business to this shop.<//text>

<Text>5 stars to this business. They value their customer. A few weeks ago I bought a 1JZ swap and they shipped to my house after few days. Motor was perfectly tight on the palette but my motor came with a broken VVTi selenoid. I called and spoke to Nick and he work out something right away. Item was perfectly described before the transaction. Additional pics and videos before I purchased. My motor started with No issue. Clean and complete swap. I will for sure be a return client and give them more business to this company. Thank you for the smooth transaction and customer service.< /Text>< Pictures>

I was recommended by a friend who dealt a few times with this shop. I called and spoke to Nick for a V6 STI Ra limited front clip and he ask me to come in person to see the clip. I asked for some additional pics  before I make the drive from San Diego to LA and he quickly sent to my email. When I show to JDM California motors to see the front clip I was surprised how clean it was for a 20 years old car. Nick hook me up for all the parts. I spend almost 10k  and I didn’t had enough money to buy the set of prodrive wheels that I wanted for long time at this time. He told me he will keep it for me until I have the money without any deposit. Overall I am happy with my clip. None of the Jdm shop has this kinda front clip. Ask for Nick at jdm California motors.< /Text>

I called for a bugeye Prodrive front end and they didn’t have at the moment. They guy who answered my call told me someone will call you when the new shipment will come in. After almost a month I received a call from Nick saying the front end is in stock. I asked for some pics and received thru email after 10 mins. I was very surprised with the customer service. I drove from Vegas to LA to pick up the front end. Great product, great selection, good customer service !</Text>

I dealt with Nick for few v7 STI 6 speed gear box and never had a single problem. This is the only spot in SoCal to get your Subaru motor and drivetrain. They are very knowledgeable in the auto industry. They can source almost any STI V7 parts. Beautiful selection and great customer service!</Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>My experience with these guys was absolutely outstanding!  Purchased a clean B18C typer swap with some Recaro seats.  They offered great price. Theres a lot of jdm shop in the area but none of them has the quality and good service. Compression tested in person. Quick tour of the shop and they have a lot of motors and parts. YOU CAN TELL THESE GUYS ARE DOING GREAT WITH ALL THE INVENTORY. They responded to all my questions.  Great business to deal with and I wouldn't hesitate purchasing from them again in the future. I will for sure coming back for the front end.

He referred me to Luis or Enrique at Oscars Motor 5954 Maywood Ave. Just a few blocks away from where his location was. The people at Oscars Motor are shady, unlicensed not to mention nobody there speaks English. They installed my motor but in the process they either damaged my exhaust manifold or replaced it with a damaged one in hopes to get more money. I called nick to see if he could help with this situation since it was his referral and the mechanics at Oscars Motor don't speak English and there was a language barrier.

After searching around at countless importers I decided to go with nick at Jdm California motors which ended up being the best descion I've made , motor had great compression and everything was included for swap. He's very nice and knowledgeable. He doesn't pressure wash the engines down also before you purchase it which helps a lot . Shinny motors are cool but it's on the inside that counts . He also did a compression text Right there on the spot and let me inspect the spark plugs . It was a positive experience. I will do slot more business with California Jdm motors in the future . I highly recommend them '!<//Review>

Got with Nick, I bought an IS300 automatic transmission, great deal on the transmission comes with short 30 day warranty but the product was good, I was a bit worried in the beginning but after installing it, it ran like a champ.  Thanks Nick for the great product, I'll come back for sure and recommend to others.</review>

Warning , this place is Garbage. Wasted my time and money . I was sold a used transmmision from junk yard. The Guy that sold it to me , said its from "JAPAN" ! But the transmission had greese and oil all over the place. When motors and transmissions come from "JAPAN" they are cleaned and tested , then rapped in plastic, shipped to US. I payed $350 for this garbage. I tryied returning this transmission the next day, the guy that works there did not want to refund my money. I told him I will call the police iff he did not pay me my cash . He said " Ill give u $250 back and charge u a $100 dollar stock fee !!!! I told him to give me $300 and keep $50 . Moral of story is , take a mexanix with you when you buy used parts. because theres alot of "Ratz" out there. Just like that Piece of  S_ _ T that sold me that Junk.< /Text>

I'm only giving 5star for service department only sales people only deserve negative 5star because I want to by new truck I went 2019 twice to talk about truck sales man told me he will get back to me once he put the truck together they never reach back so I went to buy truck in Alabama and my buddy got from texas I guess they only like to sell trucks in big quantities not 1 or 2 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Now I want to talk about service staff they are awesome #1 abraham Lopez and Enrique Lopez did take care of my truck very well and very polite  thanks thanks guys  keep up the great attitude</review>

I’ve ordered lots from here, and honestly, it’s hit or miss. I want to like this place because it’s so close to my house, but the food is not always as fresh or healthy as I wish it was. The vegetable soup I recently ordered had old mushrooms and so much oil, it defeated the purpose. Ordering from Baramee tonight proved to me that I’d prefer to spend more or go further for better food. Sorry Jasmine Hana, you need to up your game!<//Text>

They are fast, efficient, kind, and make incredibly tasty food. We have ordered to go from there often during COVID and I have zero complaints. I usually get the drunken noodles but have also gotten the yellow curry and loved it. You won't be disappointed.<//Text>

What a great place for a nice meal. Our waitress was a sweet young lady. The food is very tasty and was served quickly with beautiful presentation. I will definitely eat here again. I had the Pad Thai with tofu, yum! Go and enjoy, plenty of parking.<//Text>

<Text>Don't order extra shrimp. Once on delivery and three times for take-out I've ordered extra shrimp and three times I've not gotten anything more than when we sit down and don't order extra. One time we got 1 extra shrimp in one of two phad thai entrees ordered with extra shrimp. I think it's $4 extra per entree and if a dish comes with three or four shrimp I would expect 2-3 more shrimp. I have  never gotten them when I ordered on pineapple fried rice so I'm done asking for extra shrimp. Their food is delicious, but super frustrating when your take out or delivery isn't right and they know you won't drive there to argue the point.< /Text>< pics>

<text>Comfortable local, mom-and-pop restaurant.
They are friendly and very good people. They try to please their customers. But they are inexperienced servers and cooks (not chefs).

Food and drinks are too salty, too sweet, and too much. We ended up bringing the food home, added plain ingredients in them, and was able to yield 7 meals for 3 people. I ordered chrysanthemum tea; it was so sweet that there was nothing chrysanthemum about the tea. It was just a sugar juice.

When we asked them to pack the leftovers, they put rice and saucy food together. When we got home, we found that the rice was drenched and noddles were soggy by their sauce. This told us they are not experienced in food business and more.

I added stars for their willingness to help and effort they are putting in the service they are trying to provide. Unfortunately in this competitive business of food and beverages, eagerness is not enough.

So far, it is 4 strike out of 4 tries. Hopefully our 5th and what will be the final visit will be different. They are so nice that I want to see them change their ways and improve.< /text>< response>

My husband and I come in 2-3 times a month. We crave the Tom Yum soup and drunken noodles, also the combination fried rice is so delicious. The service is great and the staff is competent. We have always had a positive experience. I also like coming here because it's quiet and relaxing. Give it a try. Enjoy< /Review>

Good combo fried rice, but be advised they only add 2 shrimp.....That said, if you want more, you must request and pay for extra shrimp when you place your order.

The restaurant staff are also very nice and accommodating....that's a big plus because bo one likes great food and bad service. I would recommend this restaurant.<//text>

My husband and I first went here about a year ago.  We love their grilled mushroom miso, delicious and frequently come back for their Spicy Seafood Salad (you choose the heat) and veggie tempura. They also have very good sushi, although the shusmi is too oily for me.</Text>

<text>The best place to get Thai and sushi for many miles around. I love this place.

The crispy tuna rice cakes are a unique treat I've never seen anywhere else, and are amazing.

All of the sushi dishes and rolls I've tried have been exceptional, especially the baked rolls.

The sashimi is very fresh and firm. Very impressed.< /text><resp>{'time': 1462470209738, 'text': "Michael, thank you for the great review -- we were so happy to have you in.

<text>Have been here a few times already and usually order something different everytime. That's a bit because I'm indecisive on what I want and also because I have not been disappointed with anything I have selected from this place. I got the spicy beef salad and it was so spicy! I love spicy though so it was perfect. I washed it down with their thai tea and had a really great meal.<//text>< Date>

Good service and i like the drunken noodle. When I order papaya salad the waitress make sure I am ok with peanuts in it.
Sushi is also good and very reasonable price.< /review>

Loved the food here. The coconut seafood soup is ahh-mazing. So is the chowmein, orange chicken, and the eggplant dish. I would say everything else might also be delicious. Also way less expensive than other Thai food restaurants. And no I'm not fat Lol.</Text>

< Review>
Absolutely divine. One of the best meals I’ve had in my life and I cannot recommend it enough.

Steps:
Go to Napa and drink wine.
Go to Cook St Helena for dinner.
Tell everyone about both ✨</Review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>The menu had so many wonderful choices that we were only able to narrow it down to two appetizers and 2 entrees for the two of us. Three of the 4 items were outstanding. The mussels, calamari, and rabbit pappardelle were scrumptious.  The eggplant parmesan was good, too, but lacked the flavor of the other items.

The appetizer portions were so large that they could have each been meals.

The timing of the meal was perfect and our servers and wait staff  were always properly masked.

One comes here for the food and service...not the atmosphere when sitting outside.  The outside tables are under a small tent, next to the back of the building in the parking lot. Nevertheless, that shouldn't dissuade anyone from indulging in the wonderful experience.</Review><Response>None<//Response><username>M B</username>< GmapID>

We enjoy going out. Yesterday we arrived in this magnificent place which we didn’t know before. We spent a lovely evening there with excellent cooking and a courteous team and  a professional chief cook. We put this fine restaurant in our list  and we shall certainly visit again soon. We warmly recommend.< /Text>

The server James was excellent, the ambience so welcoming and modern. Food was amazing, they could have charged a lot more for the quality (very decent portions too). Definitely a great budget foodie pick.

Tip: they are the very few ones who goes continuously without break from lunch service to dinner service.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiQr2l3XJNZDWKtjtyQUYSchG7kpowjbmb5QeB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2dfnlL9oh-iX6DCA6U8ec62uBRyyGsJNQVsmz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNi1VI7bbDKNfS3Xna0iHJNi6PGsRg8XMkwoJXO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808450bd675fa9ed:0xab3d962f46b69b22<//gmap_id></record>

<review>Very friendly place in St Helena whose kitchen really cares about the food they serve. No wonder locals love it. The pastas here are super tasty, and the various starters (calamari fritti, grilled octopus etc) are brilliant too. Very nice wine list.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbbhf4gPAQr-sCnlthtNULKTtZciHD21Kb7HP5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1496865923642, 'text': 'Thank you for your comments!

Don’t get confused but there two different places under one name: tavern and restaurant. The place were empty when we arrived however we waited 55 minutes for our order. Lasagna was super oily. Too pricy for the quality.<//Review>

This is a small restaurant, so reservations are a good idea. I'm glad to say we had reservations and were seated immediately. There were 4 of us and we each got a taste of the meals everyone ordered and everything was delicious. The most pillowy gnocchi I've ever had. Highly recommend.<//Text>

< Review>
I must say that my fiance and I both were absolutely blown away by the pasta. Possibly the best dish I have ever had and she said the exact same thing.  Everyone knows we are huge foodies so this is saying something considering we live in. The heart of North Beach in San Francisco. Excellent job chef!!!!< /Review>

Great little local spot, nice room, great staff, great chef, some of the best pasta I've ever had ANYWHERE. I little loud and they serve their red wine way to warm. The gnocchi were melt-in-your-mouth to die for. I have a bunch of good food pics but Google is rejecting them. All compliments to chef Jude and the staff.</Text>

<Text>We had reservations for dinner after a day of wine tasting. We all enjoyed outlr dinners immensely. The big hit wass the mussels appetizer. We also enjoyed the calamari! The short rib dish and seafood pasta were yummy. The eggplant parm was good. The service was quick and attentive. We will certainly be back again!</Text>< pics>

< Review>
Right in the center of St. Helen's main strip, this elegant but unpretentious renovated diner) with both a counter or table seating) serves really tasty, affordable, distinctive dishes.

Vegetarian options are distinctive and tasty as well. They made sautéed zucchini and broccolini really pop.

Staff is really friendly and helpful if overworked. No fault of theirs but you can wait a while for things. But worth the wait.<//Review>

<review>Had cioppino never had so much tomato sauce on that dish. Seafood slightly over cooked. Even though we're had reservations they satis us at the bar saying they would move us when a table opened up... even though there were two open. Never moved us though. Service was good for food and drink though.< /review>< user>

<Text>My bf and I found this place while on a mini weekend getaway. There were some reviews that said a reservation isn't required, which is technically true but I would still recommend it. We didn't have to wait long, but customers with reservations were given (arguably better) tables instead of bar seating, which tbh looked more comfortable and had more elbow room. Not a deal breaker, but just something to be mindful of.

Food. OMG, the food is so good here! There's bread (with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, tsk) available upon request. For mains, he and I shared the gnocchi carbonara (it came highly recommended by some guests sitting nearby) and the cavatelli all'arrabbiata. Both were so good and complimented each other well since one was creamy and the other was slightly spicy. We also had a side of polenta since we don't see it often on menus. Finally, dessert was panna cotta with seasonal fruit. My only regret is that the restaurant isn't closer to where I live :(

Street parking was relatively easy to come by (it was even free at that time of night). Noise level was much louder than I would have liked, so much so that it was even difficult to hear my bf sitting right next to me sometimes. Service was fine but it was difficult to get their attention most of the time (even though we were sitting at the bar), and I also noticed what felt like a different "level" of service that didn't match what other customers sitting close by were experiencing. So... five stars for the food, but four for the overall experience.< /Text>< GmapID>

Heavenly! Everything about this restaurant is superb. Every dish we had was light, delicious and done to perfection. The eggplant Parmesan was a revelation, the best ever! The staff were brilliant and so nice. We are so glad they could get our reservation in. We will be back.</review>

<review>Lunch at the bar was delicious. Our group loved the freshly made pasta, very fresh ingredients, and the tasty sauces. I had the pork loin and it was one of my favorite meals of the weekend. Cooked perfectly, with very creative and delicious vegetables and a sauce that made me want to lick the plate. The ambiance felt bright and open, modern and lovely. The bartender took care of us very well and was lovely to chat with. Truly a mid-day treat!</review>< Pics>

<Text>A first visit had blown my mind off: green tomatoes were lightly breaded and fried, served over a delicate salad accompanied by some house-special fries. And then I went a second time, with high expectations. The lasagna (it was vegetarian): 2 sheets of dead pasta soaking in a thinner-than-water tomato sauce covered with layer of a cheese-like substance. No, not cool.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Probably our favorite bar in the area. Whenever we’re here for more than a few days we’ll stop in for some beer and a nice lunch or appetizers. It’s a great way to seek refuge from the... um... typical Napa Valley tourist crowd.< /Review>

< Review>
I was excited to try this place after learning the chef at Archetype was now here. And this place was good, but not memorable.  It will likely fill a niche for not too expensive, quality Italian in St Helena.<//Review>

<review>The homemade pastas at Cook are divine.  We tried the pasta seafood special and the pasta Bolognese. Both were delicious but our favorite was the Bolognese.   The chocolate flourless cake we got for dessert was rich and smooth-  a perfect way to end the evening.<//review><Date>1537922922061</Date><Gmap_id>0x808450bd675fa9ed:0xab3d962f46b69b22<//Gmap_id><UserId.>116076770241844718142< /UserId.></record>

<text>Stopped in for lunch after wine tasting and strolling through St. Helena. Luckily, they had room for us at the bar. Getting seated for 3 people is so tough sometimes.

Anyway, service was pretty good here. The food came fast and our water glass was never empty. The fried calamari is some of the best I've ever had. It's not heavily battered and fried lightly so it's not greasy. The aioli was light and citrusy, which was a perfect complement to the calamari.

The spaghetti and meatballs was absolutely amazing! It's a cream based sauce but it wasn't heavy at all. The portion size is small but perfect for lunch, especially in wine country, where you want a quick light lunch in between tastings and to save room for dinner. There was a great umami-ness to the sauce that really hit home for me. I could've done without the sun-dried tomatoes, but I can see why there is a tart element in the mix. It really wasn't necessary though because the pasta and sauce weren't heavy at all.

The value of Cook St. Helena is great for lunch. You can get by with $20-25 per person for a quality meal.</text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Worst experience of our 5 day trip to Napa.  3 couples traveling together on a 5 day fine wine and food adventure.  Tremendous dinning experiences at Mustards, French Laundry, Press, Celadon, Cindy's Backstreet Kitchen and Meadowood.  Arrived on time for our confirmed lunch reservations @ Cook.   A party of 4 entered just before us and were seated immediately despite the fact that they did not have reservations.  We were told that we did not have a reservation and that they were fully committed.  However, other than 3 occupied tables the place was empty!  While exiting the bathroom one of our party overhead the manager telling the hostess to "tell then to sit at the bar."  The Cook staff was aggressive, offensive and completely unaccommodating.< /review>

Joe and his wife run the shop, he is a very nice guy and if he can help you he will. He has been in the same spot for a very long time. He has a clean shop. Give him a shot if you needed some automotive repair.</review>

<Review>Placed an order for three meals all of which came  incorrect even though receipt says the correct contents for the order. Food for "bigger plate" was missing for two which means we paid for more than what we received. One meal had an order with peanuts, the customer is highly allergic to peanuts. It seems as though they paid no attention to the order and just put food in a box. Is this typical of Panda Express to do such a bad job?

Great food but they make door dashers and online order pickup wait outside in the hot sun for long stretches without even checking in with you.<//text>

Dynasty was not paying attention. She forgot to add Beijing beef to my order, she also forgot the teriyaki sauce in the chicken and the napkins. I was charged 15$ for a bigger plate without 1 side. Bad 👎

Really bad service.</Review>

<Text>I eat here all the time! Love it! I just need someone to show me how to order teriyaki sauce from here because it’s impossible apparently. I even ordered teriyaki chicken and didn’t get any sauce on it or on the side. Dry chicken and burnt rice for dinner, still kinda good 🤷🏼‍♀️< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80921d9a65fce7af:0xb771d97083f8451f<//gmapID></record>

<Text>Great place for quick meal.  Food is fresh and sometimes you have to wait for a batch of your order to be prepared. With Covid protocols in place you may find yourself standing in line but it's worth the wait. Love their chowmein and orange chicken. If your in the mood for American Chinese try them out.</Text>< Pictures>

Love Panda on those nights when I’m too tired or have been too busy too cook.  The online app is super easy, food is ready quickly  and always good! It’s been great especially during since the pandemic started.  I highly recommend!</Text>

<text>I mean the place is really good but before all this, it could get packed and it would be awhile wait and they should add a bit more food to the order. Well today I went and realized my order was messed up when I was already at home. I was even read each order of the plates and it was wrong in the inside.😬🤷🏻< /text><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80921d9a65fce7af:0xb771d97083f8451f< /GmapID><rate>3< /rate>< name>

Did a takeout order during our Corona quarantine. I tried to do a phone-in order and the automated system said all orders had to be submitted online. I went ahead and created an account, selected the time I wanted the food ready, and submitted my order. I entered my order at 5:00 for a 6:00 pickup time. I arrived about 7 minutes early because I was coming from another place in town. I decided to go in, figuring that they would simply prepare the order while I waited. Instead, the food was already in a bag, waiting for me. This doesn't necessarily have to be bad, but I discovered when I got home that the food was just tepid. I makes me think that they bagged the food as soon as the order came in and set it off to the side rather than preparing it right before a 6:00 pickup time. I have no idea how long my food sat out. This is not a good thing.<//Text>

Terrible customer service! They were out of ice and offered no alternative. No refund for my drink and when I suggested a bottle option she said no and gave me a look like I was trying to take advantage. I needed tea and they brew that fresh so it needs ice or its warm/room temperature. Worst part is the guy behind me also got a drink so then we were both screwed. When I told her she needed to tell people in line she snapped back and said she was. Not that guy though... all in all she was not helpful and just was like... sucks to need ice.< /text>

So slooooooow, and the drinks are warm. And they are always out of orange chicken and veggies. How are they out of their main selling orange chicken? Oh well. It's the only one around and at least the food is decent when you get it.< /review>

Terrible service. Online order. Waiting over 30mins just to have the Manager on duty asking me for a confirmation email multiple times when I had the confirmation number in hand for her to find my order. Took her multiple times and delay my order until she actually "found it". Ended up being an incomplete order after and had to wait a bit longer before getting the rest of it. Online ordering here is trash.<//text>

I'm also happy that this place is still so flipping busy. My rating is because they fail to smoothly run this store, and I witnessed a health violation. I ordered online for the first time, and I won't be doing it ever again. Food was to be ready by 7:10, so I show up at 7:12...waited over 10 minutes to talk with an associate who grabbed my order that had been sitting there since before I arrived. There were also 2 other people who ordered online waiting before me who had to wait just as long as I did. No associates asked us if we needed help, nor was there a designated online orders associate (there desperately needed to be one with a line out the door). While waiting I witnessed an associate at a cooking station drop a giant plastic bin lid on the ground. No big deal, put it in the sink, wash your hands and go back to work...NOPE. A fellow associate picked it up, placed it on a work surface, and continued to handle food...I'm just happy that my order didn't get messed up. No utensils though. I will happily never come to this location ever again.< /Text>< Rate>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>The food is good for what it is. No it's not authentic.  But it's fast food, let's be realistic.  The service is friendly,  the food is hot and conned properly and they try to move as fast as they can.  Only four stars because they tend to run understaffed,  so the line really backs up,  indicative of how good the food is.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>I have put up with the slow service without much compliant, Going in at 9:15 pm to a restaurant that doesn't quit serving until 10:00 pm standing in line for five minutes and when several others get in line they come up with we are not cooking anymore this is at 9:25 pm so the decision had been made before 9:15 pm not to cook anymore. So all you could get was line left overs. All I know is I want spend anymore of my money here it should be some customer services so you cook smaller portions until 9:45 pm are put it on your website and signs that you quit cooking at 9:15 pm so people understand that all they are getting is going to be leftovers.</Review>< user>

<review>2.5 stars, I suppose. It's hit and miss with both service and quality of food. Mostly it's the service. Compared to other Panda Express locations throughout the South Bay, the standards are low.

The other day, my wife watched an employee drop one of our meals on the floor. The kid who dropped it was about to pick it up and keep serving, but another employee saw my wife watching him. It wasn't until that point that he was told to remake it.

The food. Well, YOU have to be the one to decide if you're going to eat what's available. They'll leave stuff on the steamer all day if no one orders it, so it's buyer beware. Pretty easy to tell either way. No matter what you order, rest assured the servers will do something dumb, like give you egg rolls with no sweet and sour sauce.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Steam table food served cafeteria style. Food was okay, but bland in my opinion. I was disappointed as it was very busy. Did not meet expectations for quality or freshness.</Review>

It's good for quick Americanized Chinese food. The service is usually slow but always really friendly. The food is usually hot and they are always willing to make fresh food while you wait.< /text>

The food is good, what you would expect from a Panda restaurant. However, the people working the line are too slow. They need better training of the food servers to move things along.<//Text>

< Review>
If you've grown up eating Cantonese Chinese food you will definitely be disappointed. Panda Express is the Taco Bell of Chinese food. Vegetables are not crisp, items sit too long on the steamer trays. I thought it's one redeeming quality would be that it's one of the few places in Hollister that serve after 9 p.m. but it only serves leftovers after 9 p.m. . Smaller individual portions on The Late Night menu would go far in this town. I don't eat there anymore after three tries but I would if the late-night menu was fresher. Hope they listen to their customers.....<//Review>

<text>Slow service---I decided to give them another try.  Poor service and outright rude. She handed me my food in a bag, the box was leaking the liquid all over. They were almost ready to close to. She was trying to rush me out the door.
Forget this place!!!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rate>

Expensive. Go to the Chinese restaurant across the street, it's better!

They need to stop being so cheap, they want to charge you a lot for reheated food.

They should turn it into a buffet, $10 and you get anything you want. Then it would be better</review>

NO EGGPLANT, so if your vegan/veggi you get 'mixed stramed veggies' and that is it. Every other store I've ever been to has a decent menu and this place acted like I was insane for requesting it.</Review>

The workers in Hollister need to go and take notes from the Gilroy Pandas. There so slow in Hollister and people always have to wait for a new batch of food to be cooked because they run out of what they have on the line.< /Review>

The place was cheaper than the SF Bay Area as Panda Express but was sort of dirty. It was a clear day, but the bathroom floor had dirty black and muddy water. Tables were not very clean either... Only reason to eat here is if you are avoiding McDonald's and Burger King... They also didn't have a lot of the menu items here.<//Text>

Thank you so much for helping us create a special birthday for our son so far from home. With little notice you created delicious cupcakes from scratch, delivered them to our campsite, at a reasonable price. We are very pleased.</Text>

< Review>
People you want good bread around town that don't charge you an eye for each piece come here !!! Reasonable prices Good bread to eat with coffee. I come here to buy for small gatherings everyone asks me where did I get the bread  cause they love it ! They also sell tasty food like pupusas and tamales that are made with the green leaves those are also very good my favorite are chicken. Tbey also have arroz con leche on somedays in the mornings or corn atole it's one of my favorites you can taste the sweet pieces of corn while sippy your warm atole I really recommend it its the best tasting around town and even in price compared to a Other places I have tried. I recommend this place to all, the best times are mornings to find  everything still there available since they run out fast.<//Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) I think it is bad attention on your part to give a ticket without a description of the products for which one pays .... I went this morning and ordered and when I got home and took out my food I realized that something that I had ordered was not It was in my bag, so I have no doubt if they charged me or not then no idea if they told me and they did not give it to me or if not because besides that they do not have prices in view of the meals they offer .. ..the employees seem to be more interested in gossip than concentrating on their work.

(Original)
Me parece mal atencion de su parte al dar un ticket sin descripcion de los priductos por los que uno paga....hou fui esta mañana y ordené y cuando llegué a casa y saque mi comida me di cuenta que algo que yo habia ordenado no estaba en mi bolsa, entonces me queda la duda si me lo cobraron o no entonces ni idea si si me lo conraron y no me lo dieron o si no porque ademas de eso ellos no tienen precios a la vista de las comidas que ofrecen....las empleadas les parecen estar mas interesadas en el chisme que concentrarse en su trabajo.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZ6NLD4-kb2mmQfNa1gPXyUYfh40Vm2cBFUbpf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<text>(Translated by Google) Terrible service, I bought some guava empanadas that I have for years that I have always bought in this place and this time they were bitter and I went to return them and I was really disappointed by the service.
I never come back again

(Translated by Google) I like to support Latino businesses, but this place, they DO NOT have an appreciation for the people who are going to buy the staff is very rude, and the bread is not of good quality. He does NOT greet you and they are always in a bad mood.

<review>I was going to buy a car from this dealership and am so glad I did not. I felt they were dishonest and I walked out on what was an all but a done deal. I called about a specific car, talked to a pleasant salesman and ultimately agreed on a price and trade-in value. He  then sent me a WRITTEN AND SIGNED price sheet on the car showing all the details. I expressed some concerns about taxes and registration as I live in Arizona and this dealer is in California, but he assured me that they sell cars to Arizonans all the time and its perfectly routine and not a problem. So we cleared our calendars and drove 250 miles one way to close the deal and pick up the car. However, when we got there, we hear "oops, the computer made a mistake and miscalculated your sales tax", increasing our cost by $1,425. I do not have any problem paying sales tax, that was not the issue. I am perfectly willing to pay whatever it is. The problem was that we agreed on a bottom line price and we committed a full day and 500 miles to hold up our end of the deal. After much discussion about THEIR mistake they were unwilling to budge even a penny to compensate for it. So we got up and walked out and drove 250 miles back home, vowing never to return. We subsequently bought another vehicle from an Arizona dealer. I told some of this story to them and they rolled their eyes and said, wow, that's the oldest trick in the book. The sad thing is, if Rogers and Rogers had offered to make almost any sort of concession, we would have bought the car. But they would not, and did not, budge at all. Not a single penny. They knew that we were well committed after driving all that way and I'm sure felt that they had us over a barrel. Wrong. I've learned over the years how to deal with kind of behavior. I have no regrets whatsoever about walking out. I would rather live with the lost day knowing that I kept my word and integrity. There are plenty of other car dealers out there. My recommendation is to avoid these people. I'm sure they will try to claim that it was an honest mistake, but I don't buy it, and neither do any other the people I've talked to about it.</review>< pictures>

My service advisor was extremely helpful and professional.  He took the time to notice that I had not yet received my first free oil change on a previous visit.  I appreciated his effort and will definitely continue to bring my car to Rogers and Rogers for service as needed.  Thank you so much!< /text>

Service Department review:
Had an issue with our Nissan Juke and had to tow it to the dealership in the middle of the night. Carolina and her team got to work on it the next day. Diagnosed and fixed the issue and we are back on the road with minimal cost.

Thanks Rogers and Rogers Nissan!<//text>

Great customer service.
They value your time and ask you if you want a free car wash for waiting for your vehicle after the service is done. Basically you get your car serviced and a clean car for free. I've taken my other vehicle to the Ford dealer and never have been offered anything for free. That's how good Roger's service department is.
Keep up the good work.<//review>

I was interested in a car and spoke to a salesman. He told me to go in so we can look at the car and work some numbers for my trade in. I’m coming from Yuma, AZ. Went in and they told me the car was not there anymore. So I drove for nothing, but I wanted to see some more cars so I looked. Was getting pushed to buy a vehicle that I didn’t want. I told them my limit and still tried to go almost 200$ over what I said I can afford. I felt really pressured and uncomfortable. The salesman had my keys and registration for the vehicle I was going to trade in. Didn’t want to give me back my keys because he knew I was going to leave. Kept telling me to hold on. Kept asking why I didn’t want to buy the car. Asked why I was “getting cold feet”. I could tell that The “United” manager was upset for not wanting the over charged car. I said NO the first time. Made me feel bad for not buying a car when I drove out of my way for a car that wasn’t there. Nobody apologized nor was compensated for gas atleast. And still tried to over charge me. I guess they’re transitioning to a typical chain store called “United”. “United” together to take all their guest money. Would not recommend better deals out there instead of money hungry “salesman”. Should feel like family instead of manipulation. Haven’t even opened up as “United” and they’re already trying to squeeze every penny out of me. This new dealership “United” is not good people. Especially during this pandemic.</Text>

<Review>This dealership works with a company called auto credit express for poor credit autoloans, then forces you to pay transunion for your credit score which the dealership won't take, then that sends you to this dealership which will then run your credit, causing a hard inquiry on your credit report which is negative and will remain there for 2 years and then can't even tell you how much you're pre-approved for, until they force a car down your throat.</Review></record>

I was very disappointed by my recent survey, I took my car in for a recall and said since I am there let me get an oil change. They found my tail lights were out, did not discuss with me till I was paying, right now with the virus a simple thing like changing the light don"t you think they should have discussed and fixed right there??? I hope you change your way you guys used to be very reliable, thank you Mary Ann Swansbro< /Text>

Excellent car and customer service! Jerry listened to every si glue thing I mentioned and everything got solved. There’s only one issue pending, but only because they had to order the part. I thought it was going to take days to fix, but no. I dropped off in the morning and it was ready in a few hours. They even pick you up from work!

Thank you, Jerry!<//text>

It is unbelievable for the amount you charged me, that my car doesn't deserve to be washed... In other dealers such a Direct Auto Plaza my car just for an oil change, every time were delivered to me super clean... GRACIAS< /Review>

<review>This dealer and i have a love/hate relationship.  I took my truck in for help with some things i needed done and they couldn't do the work.  I also had a new noise from the truck that was bothering me so i took it back to them only to hear them tell me "that is normal".  Too my truck to a different dealer in La Quinta and they were able to correct everything and knew what the "noise" was almost immediately and fixed the problem that Rogers and Rogers said was "normal".  I like that this dealer is local but they don't know what the heck they are doing and their techs must not have much experience to diagnose problems resulting in having to go pay another dealer to do the work.  Don't plan on ever having my truck serviced here again.</review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< Rate>

After 50 minutes of waiting a supervisor was notified and in another 30 minutes she got to the bottom of things.  But a nice thing they did is provide a loaner car since the car wasn't fixed yet and this is a long weekend with no repairs being done till Tuesday.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>I absolutely love the service here...came to buy a car in January 2016 and sales rep Armando and Juan Carlos were absolutely great...they were very patient and extremely helpful and encouraging. I left that day very happy with a great  car ,I then came back with a very important issue that needed to be attended to..Carlos in  service department exceeded above and beyond my expectation for customer service. ..he went the extra mile in making sure my car was taken care of...me and my family are extremely grateful for the awesome service and care given by Carlos and the whole staff there.<//review><gmapID>0x80d75f4d7d96fe97:0xe46c93f7ec8d0201< /gmapID>< Pictures>

Dont buy hear! Warning!! If you do make a purchase make sure you read everything you sign as they will sell you things you don't need or want, my own damn fault for not reading! But still this isn't right, thats abuse of trust. They'll do anything even sneaky stuff to up sell you. Be careful!!< /Review>

Terrible sales and service.  Sales said they'd price match a dealership in the Phoenix area.  When I got to R&R, suddenly they won't price match.  Just an unethical tactic to get you to come in and waste your gas.

Had a service appointment.  Arrived 20 minutes early.  Told me it was a 2 hour wait.  Asked how it could be such a long wait if I had an appointment.  Advised me it was just the drop-off time.  Asked if they could hold my spot while I ran some errands.  No luck - apparently my car needs to "stand in line" or it will lose it's spot.<//Text>

Unprofessional trying to buy a car online to surprise my wife before I go on deployment on Monday and gave my information to buy the car besides running credit until I have roughly the payment I’m looking for. At the end of the day give what your customer ask to sell them a car and move on to the next. Maribel completely not helpful. I guess this place does not stand to help service members that want to do something special for its service members will buy a car when I’m back from my local dealership in Los Angeles when I’m back.</review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>This place is a joke. I have always disliked this dealership from the get go. Sadly, had I known I would end up back in the Imperial Valley, I would not have purchased a Nissan to avoid this dealership. I love Nissan and Infiniti vehicles but this place has horrible customer service and service department is a joke. Took my vehicle in to repair some ongoing issues and was told by them that the original issues with my car could not be located and probably weren't documented correctly at the dealership I purchased the car from. I contacted the dealership and they assured me that the information was documented and provided me with an email of the documentation and stated that they did not understand how a dealership would not have access to this information, as they document on the same system that is Universal for all dealerships. They couldn't explain why they were unable to see previous documentation and issues were not addressed.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>Service had me waiting in line for almost 30 mins before getting too me
Constantly kept asking me if I needed a ride even though I said I had someone picking me up (seemed desperate to get me out of the lobby - terribly rude)
Said they would call when service was finished but only sent text & email
When I came to pick up vehicle it took another 20 minutes (no organization)< /text>< Pictures>

I would like to thank Evalyn and Jorge in finance who resolved my issues in less than 10 minutes. Mr Cruz in service did everything I asked him to do and I was completely satisfied. Great job in management and all the way down the line! I would return again.< /text>

When we purchased the 2015 Nissan Juke the sticker said it was equipped with Sirius Radio (all our vehicles have Sirius because we live in Yuma and the reception is terrible). We get back home and call Sirius to get hooked up and find out the car IS NOT EQUIPPED with Sirius Radio. We contacted Rogers and Rogers and they FINALLY agreed to have a Sirius radio attachment installed. Three days later we pick up the car, drive 65 miles back to Yuma, contact Sirius Radio, and then find out that the installed equipment will not work. We have tried for 2 days to get a hold of our Roger and Roger contact and have got nothing but a runaround and left on hold to 22 minutes. Ongoing....any suggestions?<//text>

<review>BROKEN WINDSHIELD after oil service. At the time of pick up my infiniti they told me to go and pay because it was ready, at the cashier told me it was not, got back with the Service Rep and told me that they will car wash it and it will take 10 mins. 20 mins after finally got it, it was there since early in the morning and at 5pm they just put it thru the car wash. They gave me the keys and as soon I got into the car it had a foot and a half crack. They blamed it on me telling me that it “probably” had a chip and with the car wash just broke, how convenient. What makes me mad is that they didn’t tell me that was broken, they just hand me the keys like nothing had happpend. After arguing with the manager they agreed to pay 50% (of $180 that cost the windshield)  because when you sing the paper work before the service you agree that is something like this happens they are not responsible. At the end I payed 100% because it was getting complicated and I’m not planning to go back ever to that place. I serviced 3 of my cars there for the last 4 years but that’s it, not going back for service o buying a car.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

DO NOT BOTHER GOING TO THIS DEALERS SALES REPS. There is a Sr. Sales Rep that tried to sale me a car. The price was ok. It was not the best price but it was ok. But, the deal breaker was the attitude of the sales guy. He was unprofessional, impolite, aggressive, and has a plain bitchy attitude when his deal was challenge. The only reason I decline the offer was because he pissed me off. If you want a Nissan go to San Diego or Coachela Valley Sales Reps have a way better attitude.< /review>

<text>Went to Roges & Roger's Nissan to buy a car that was advertised for 7,999.00. (See picture) Ad does say + tax & license but when they came to our table with the numbers they added on an additional 2,000.00 for some kind of 10 year protection we don't want or need. The ad does not say anything about + any kind of protection. False advertising!!<//text>< response>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Terrible place, terrible service. The cars leave with factory failures and the agency does not want to be held responsible.
Bad place to buy a car.

(Translated by Google) I bought a car on Saturday they charged me for all of Saturday, today is Tuesday and they tell me that they still cannot deliver the car to me that probably until tomorrow, taking accounts, it will cost 25 dlls a day, the car up to now is going 100 dlls, do you plan to reimburse them? Or as? Because they told me to go buy that car and I pay for the car on Saturday and it is not fair that just for selling one they paint it very beautiful and leave me just like right now without my money and without a car.

(Original)
Compre un carro el sábado me cobraron todo el sábado hoy es martes y me comunican que aun no me pueden entregar el carro que probablemente hasta mañana sacando cuentas me sale en 25 dlls al día el carro hasta ahorita van 100 dlls me los piensan reembolsar? O como? Por que a mi me hablaron que fuera a comprar ese carro y yo pague por el carro el sábado y no es justo que nomas por vender a uno se la pinten bien bonito y me dejen así como ahorita sin mi dinero y sin carro.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) When you buy a car from an agency like Nissan, you only think that you are not going to battle in the future because it is a highly prestigious agency, but recently the transmission of my car broke down and had to be replaced by a new one. My car was for almost a full month in the workshop and nobody spoke to tell me what was happening, I had to be calling to find out how the process was going and this part was very unpleasant since nobody ever knew anything, they were always at lunch or alone they said "they are going to call you back" and never did. On Monday, June 8, I called in the morning and in the same way they did not know how to give me reason and decided to go in the afternoon to see what was happening and when I was there they told me "your car is already alone we lost the key", and nobody took the bother to tell me what happened I had to return the next day for the car. This experience made me feel that Rogers and Roger is not as professional as I once believed.

Cuando compras un carro en una agencia como Nissan solo piensas en no vas a batallar en un futuro pues es una agencia de alto prestigio pero recientemente la transmisión de mi carro se averió y tuvo que ser remplazada por una nueva. Mi carro estuvo por casi un mes completo en el taller y nadie me hablaba para decirme que pasaba, yo tenia que estar llamando para saber como iba el proceso y esta parte fue muy desagradable ya que nadie sabia nunca nada, siempre estaban en lonche o solo decian "le van a regresar la llamada" y nunca lo hacian. El lunes 8 de junio llame por la mañana y de igual forma no sabian darme razon y decidi ir por la tarde para ver que pasaba y al estar alli me dijeron "tu carro ya esta solo que perdimos la llave",  y nadie se tomo la molestia de decirme lo ocurrido tuve que volver al siguiente dia por el carro. Esta experiencia me hizo sentir que rogers and roger no es tan profesional como alguna vez crei.</text>

<Review>My absolute favorite place to shop for my little ones! Their prices are great and you can rest assured that everything in store is in great shape or else they wouldn’t be selling it. With kids growing so quick it is so nice being able to sell what doesn’t fit them anymore and put that money towards getting the next size up!< /Review>< Resp>

It’s been a great way to make some money on kids’ clothing, shoes, books, and toys without having to invest a bunch of time taking photos, posting them, meeting buyers, etc. If you want to sell, you sign up for a drop-off date on their website. Drop-off is very easy! Sometimes they can even look through your things while you shop if you don’t want to have to return later.

The prices are certainly higher than garage sales or some thrift stores, but I love that it’s organized by size, which makes it easy to find what I’m looking for and saves TIME. They also have great sales, which you can find on Instagram and Facebook. We will be back, love this place!< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Something about the staff at Children's Orchard Santa Clarita in general drives me crazy. I hate that hipster im too cool for you mentality. if you can look past the snooty staff you might find some buys! check out the shoes/boots and jeans! You are bound to find something you like. The dress section is worth taking a look through also.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1606579105817, 'text': 'Hi Penny- we are sorry to hear you had a less than ideal interaction with our staff.

< Review>
Made an appointment on Monday to bring in items to sell as I usually have done in the past. Drove from Ventura County all the way to Santa Clarita just to have them tell me that they aren't buying anymore. They are only taking our items in exchange for their store credit.  I am furious mind you I drove more than an hour with my young kid in the car. All they had to do was let me know the time I made the appointment over the phone.  Plus the cashier was very rude and aggressive when handing me a informational  brochure</Review>

Nice people and a good place to bring your old kids toys and clothes and get a couple bucks if you don't liking meeting with people and selling them yourself. All your toys must be in good condition and cannot be missing parts or they will not buy them but you can still donate. Slow but everything is nice and the process is easy. You won't get rich but you get something and get to pass your stuff on.</Text>

Then you have 24 Thathrs to pick up the money. would be nice to know before you go to the store and what they would actually like. I was told winter's winter's clothes, Harry Potter........

<Review>I've been here a couple times  first time I  was welcomed by a very nice lady overall first time experience was great! I went in today and wasn't very happy with the experience. I came in to sell some of my son's  stuff that he no longer uses, I'm a stay at home mom so I have my son with me 99% of the time I went in and asked first and explained to them what I had I had my son strapped to me and no one offered to help me carry anything in. So I carried a swing , bassinet , a musical seat and push cart all in by myself while having my son strapped to me..... .not only did this come off extremely rude sense there were 3 people working the front and none of them were helping anyone. no one even bothered to at least open the door for me as it was obvious I was struggling. Only at the end of everything a very wonderful lady who I didn't get the chance of getting her name ( she had red hair and an accent ) was so beyond nice to me ! She was the ONLY one to help me carry stuff out and help me and I believe she had not even clocked in yet. Very sad I really liked this store but after this experience I don't think I'll be back for selling or purchasing .</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>GREAT staff members who are friendly and go out of their way to help you; AMAZING deals on not only name brand clothes but boutique and luxury brands too (they have a pair of Gucci shoes and a Dolce & Gabbana jacket in the store RIGHT NOW); they PAY you for your gently used clothes; and the cherry on top is that by purchasing used clothes you are helping our planet & keeping more items out of land fills.

I like this place but have only found a few good deals here and there. Children’s place has better deals than them. The staff is short with you sometimes or don’t talk at all. I asked a staff member a question once and he completely ignored me and so did the rest of the staff standing around. They seem stuck up.<//Review>

Very clean and well organized place. The items in the store are in great condition and some are even brand new which is awesome. The staff wasn't much for interacting but was nice when checking out. Several things I believe were over priced but that was mostly for equipment and furniture items. My only problem is I was over charged $1.50 and I know it might sound like nothing but when you have several kids and you're going to this store specifically to save money and live 30 miles away, that $1.50 goes a long way. I have recommended this place to others with the advice to make sure they aren't being overpriced. Overall I liked it so I will give it another shot as I believe in second chances and I understand people sometimes make mistakes.</Review>

Cannot vouch for anything but the Greek Gyros.  They hold up to many places that specialize in Mediterranean food in the area.    Great quick lunch when we are out and on the go.<//review>

I love their food. Their service is great but I called to see if they could sell the bronco Berry sauce by itself and they don't. Really should be able to sell it for like maybe $0.50 cents to 75 cents a piece but other than that it's good</Text>

After seeing Arby's new promotions I wanted to try the Smokehouse Brisket $5.01, it's not bad, but small for the price, but you could taste the smoke flavor and the BBQ sauce was mild. I also had the Onion Rings $2.29 and they were pretty good. A small drink $1.99. Service was fast but we were the only people inside.<//Text>

There order microphone wasn't working and it took forever in the drive thru. We had to order at the window and it was just time consuming and confusing. But I got lucky when I finally got to place my order, they had one ready. My food was good.</Text>

We don’t normally go to Arby’s but decided to go get a fish sandwich for my husband and he brought me back what was supposed to be the smokehouse brisket sandwich. What I received was not a brisket sandwich. It was some kind of wrap with shaved meat I think possibly beef, tasted horrible. Arby’s fish sandwich was not near as good as McDonalds. I tried calling to complain and the phone just rang and rang and rang, they must be getting a lot of calls for in accurate orders today. We will never go there again I suggest you don’t either.<//Text>

Just waited over 30 minutes in their drive through. Just to be told, our system is down and we can only accept cash. People should not be sitting in the drive through for 30+ minutes. Absolutely horrible service. I won’t be back.<//Text>

I have an allergy that I was very specific about and I had to send my sandwich back three times so I wouldn't end up in the hospital while traveling.  Very scary!!<//Review>

Arby's is always good. This one is a little hard to get to if you are going west on the highway, but it's worth it. I love the beef and cheddar. So good.< /Review>

< Review>
The French Dip with Au Jus sauce is good but not well-seasoned. The AuJus sauce seemed to be lacking in salt and tasted watered down. I ordered the meal and was disappointed with the hard, not even warm curly fries and threw them away. For the $10 I paid it was not worth the meal I received. Maybe I should call and ask for a replacement meal. I've been to Arby's in the past and enjoyed the meal then. But this time around, no thank you.< /Review>

<review>This is the worst Arby’s to come to. Yesterday one person in store no help and shuts down the restaurant during lunch hours! Today not a sign posted not a warning drive thru is clear for customers but not a single person working and 8 cars in drive thru . Thanks for wasting my time and others while not even posting a sign that you are closed!!!!!! Horrible spot to eat at< /review><userid>113489513736421974660<//userid><time>1596919532040</time>< resp>

<review>Its been over a year since my husband went to Arbys. We were sitting in the restaurant trying to enjoy our meal but 2 of the managers were talking loud enough near the registers about an employee using her name, it was not flattering.  Her coworkers could here it, other customers.  I think that falls under public embarrassment.  I went to the counter. Called the mangers out on their behavior,  and suggested they move their discussion to their office away from listening ears.</review>< userid>

<Review>Arbys didnt disappoint us of course they never have, today's was a philly steak & cheese omg best I've ever had honestly. My husband had the Brisket Sandwich & loved his also, My only complaint with Arbys is there isnt 1 in Tulare Ca. Where i live, so we have to go to neighboring towns to get it, SO IM ASKING YOU TO PLEASE OPEN 1 IN TULARE WE NEED MORE THAN BURGERS & TACOS, THANK YOU</Review>< response>

<Review>This low review is no reflection on the employees or the food, but is about an owner that has a broken air conditioner and doesn’t repair it. The interior of their building today was oppressive. It is summer in the San Joaquin  Valley and the workers have one 10 inch fan on the floor.  It is outrageous  to expect their employees to work under these conditions. One customer ordering mentioned that their air has been down for months.<//Review>< Rating>

I went inside to try and eat and their air conditioning was broken. I asked them when they were going to get it fixed and the reply was that they were not because it was going to be too expensive. So if you enjoy eating where is approximately 100 degrees inside then go for it. Otherwise you might want to think about somewhere else!</Review>

It was good, but they forgot to give me my cheese sticks.  I called them and let them know and they were gonna have them under my name(Mary). My son (Mike)was gonna pick them up the other day but forgot. but I have yet to go get them. It was last week. But other then that. Everything was good.
I still haven't picked them up. I still want them. But I have a broken ankle and can't drive.😔</Text>

<text>I usually get great service everytime I go but tonight that was not the case I ordered through the drive thru and had to have everything remade the fries were cold both my roast beef sandwhiches were cold and the chicken was hard as a rock. I went inside to wait for my food to be remade and they were just putting in the microwave to warm it up when I asked them if they were microwaving my food the manager said that it was all fresh (it's not fresh if they are microwaving it) the cook was rude rolling his eyes at me and kept saying things about me out loud for me to hear with the manager right there not telling him to stop or apologizing for his behavior...worst service ever!!!</text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Fresh tasting sandwiches! Not surprised to see this location busy after the lunch hour.  Building facade is dated and in need of freshness to match the great sandwiches they sell on the inside. Unfortunately they forgot my requested Arby sauce to put on my classic.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x8095261d150efef7:0x528c613dad11cba</Gmap_id>< Resp>

<Review>We ordered our food paid for it at window waited 10 minutes different girl came to window asked what we needed we repeated the order told her we already paid. We waited another 10 min when they came out with our food get home and order was half right. I guess they where busy with the 4 customers in the restaurant.  It has been over 5 years and probably will not go back< /Review>< Pics>

<review>The commercials make it look appealing, and it's not bad, just a little expensive. I don't go often so I didn't remember that when you order a classic roast beef sandwich they make it up dry! No ketchup, BBQ sauce, nothing so I didn't care too much for that. Last straw for me was the air conditioning was broken when I went at lunchtime, very uncomfortably HOT, wasn't really hungry after being there for very long.</review>< name>

Nothing was refilled or it was broken.  no  paper towels in restroom. ketchup, horseradish,  Arby's sauce empty, not working,  or clogged with product.  employees didn't even attempt to offer product from behind counter. I had to approach them and ask for what I needed.  food was great but customer service and attitude from employees was lacking this visit.</review>

For this place specifically, the food is kinda cheap. But if you go inside it looks not very updated(the furnishes). Most likely all of it and not just the tables but like cup lids are way to cheap almost like paper. Haven't checked the bathroom. It looks like stains everywhere. Not very busy.</text>

I have alway loved arbys. Cant get enough of their roast beef and cheddar sandwiches. At $5+ per sandwich ....not including the meal... I dont go very often but when I do I really enjoy it. If your wanting a good meal, thats fast, and you have slightly more pocket change then a trip to mcdonalds definitely give arbys a try.< /text>

<review>Just pulled up to an Arby's in Visalia Ca. Was treated very curtly and disrespectfully by a staff that was also screaming at each other about the customers they were serving. I have worked in retail for 15 years, I understand the struggle but this was absolutely unacceptable. Will not waste my money there again.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I love Arby's. The service is great!
The staff are friendly and curteous.
The food is delicious!  The sandwiches have a lot of meat and the bread is fresh.  I love Arby's hearty meals, thank you.< /text>

Wow! They fired Lori the one person that always had a smile on her face and was one of the best customer service people I have EVER met. Anyone that misses her, she works at Sonic in Tulare...I would recommend that over this dump. It's a shame because I love Arbys but will never go to this one bc thier more worried about money than thier customers! MANAGEMENT better step up and realize what runs thier business everyday...and that is great people like Lori.</review>

<text>The inside of Arby's is literally falling apart the ceiling it looks like it's going to cave in there are some wires exposed by the drink despenser the place really needs alot of upgrades better seating arrangement better interior better ceiling protection and floors and everything needs to be all upgraded the place looks like it hasn't been upgraded in like 20 years it needs to be to have a serious upgrade I won't go back there unless that place is fully upgraded inside and out the drive-through can use a huge upgrade the entire building itself to use a huge upgrade and remodel they need to basically demolish the old one and it plays build a brand new one that's all modern and upgraded all new equipment all new computer systems the place can use a lot of TLC seriously I hope somebody reads this review and actually decides to do something to Arby's Andre and actually upgrad it cleans whoever reads this review do not dismiss it this is coming from a former customer review upgrade the Arby's here in Visalia Visalia has money to build houses so why can't they use that money to upgrade Arby's here in Visalia they have the money to build another restaurant and on top of that another gas stations when they could be upgrading Arby's they have McDonald's and Starbucks in the gas stations on every corner but we need to upgrade Arby's here in Visalia stop wasting money on things we don't need Arby's needs a lot more attention than you think so please upgrade everything in Arby's restaurant.the sound system of Arby's could use. A really nice upgrade as well inside and out<//text>< pictures>

I gave it 3 cuz the employee was nice and she was being tortured by the company not fixing the air conditioning for 2 summers now and it was hot and humid they had a house fan on top of a trash can oscillating the carpet was beyond disgusting and tables where from 1996 when they first opened the chair I sat it almost fell apart all the chairs seem to be from 1996 also the tiles on ceiling were black from dirt and dust from years of neglect it was very disappointing since there is only one in the surrounding county and it looks horrible which also makes me wonder about the cleanliness and food preparation hope this reaches the CEO of arby's pass it along</Text>

Nice place, shake machine broken. But when you get a most roast beef sandwich it is probably for the best that the shake machine is broken. I am taking that as the cardiac gods are watching out for me.< /review>

I like that they rarely pre-cook their chicken and side items, always fresh and delicious! I talked to them and they explained that they believe in quality and that fresh is always better~ I don't mind waiting for fresh food, that works for me! Also, I have noticed that EVERY time I have gone to Arby's, that going inside to order is faster than drive through- So if you don't mind a wait, got that route~ But for me, I will go inside :) THANK YOU ARBYS! Great food, great customer service and great people! We will see you soon!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I love Arbys but this location is not worthy of “having the meats” as their meat here are not even suitable for for sale at the dollar store. For some reason the the roast beef here does not have that full flavor that i have gotten at other arby locations. We ordered the gyros as well, which even a Greek person would have been disgusted by, as selling such an atrocity is a low blow to the country of Greece. The lack of tziki suace paired with dry meat.......need i say more. Dont count (no pun intended) on ordering 6pc mozzarella sticks, they will give you a 4pc instead. Save your tummy and your money unless you want to pay the 6pc price for a 4pc.<//review><Response>None<//Response><pictures>None<//pictures>< Rate>

<Review>I have been calling weekly since the first week of July 2016 and they still do not have the milkshake machine fixed!!! This is not good for business, not for something that can be so easily  repaired!!! Will not return, will no longer call, will say so long to Arby's Visalia.< /Review><username>CL Pacheco<//username><Gmap_id>0x8095261d150efef7:0x528c613dad11cba< /Gmap_id><user_id>115952888006480843040< /user_id>< Pictures>
