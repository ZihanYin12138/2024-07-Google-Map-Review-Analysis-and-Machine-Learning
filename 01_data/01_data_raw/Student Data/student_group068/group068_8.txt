I have been coming here for 15 years.  Fast service with a reasonable price.  Use the coupon on their website to get the cheapest price.<//Review>

<Review>I have been taking all of my cars here  for about 10 years now. They have always been honest, fast and a pleasure to do business with. Lee even fixed my a/c in my old Gimmy. It would be very easy for a smog shop to take advantage of customers,  but not here. Key word, HONEST.</Review>< gmap_id>

<review>There were about 3 vehicles ahead of me, so I was told it would be about 20 minutes. I had a coupon I had printed out and gave it to Lee. I checked in on Yelp and a $20.00 coupon popped up. I asked Dan if I could use that too since I already have the coupon. He went and asked Lee. They said they would take off another $5.00 since I already was using a coupon. Wow! Honestly, I was prepared for them to say no since I had the other coupon. $5.00 is $5.00, I'll take and appreciate it!
My vehicle was done in avout 20 minutes. And yes, it PASSED!!! Yhanks Lee and Dan.<//review></record>

Owner treated me right.
He explained the new rules after getting a check engine light fixed on the vehicle.

I was there three times with the car and he was patient.
He only charged me for one smog check and at the end when the car finally passed he just charged me the $8,25 fir the certificate< /Review>

Took my RV in for a smog check. Tight parking lot conditions however, probably one of the best smog checks I ever had to deal with. Owner and single technician shop with a very pleasant deminor that I would even send my wife to deal with. Will be returning with my other vehicles as they become due for testing. Highly recommend</review>

Thank you Lee for being you!  Today I came into your shop to get a Smog Check and was fully satisfied.  I was in and out in about 15min.  The shop itself, including the bathroom, was clean.  This is very rare in the industry of mechanics.  I will be recommending you and your shop to anyone who asks me for your kind of services.

I also appreciate you taking your time to check my power steering fluid, helping me learn and determine if I needed to add some.  I did need to and you simply educated me on the levels and sent me on my way to do this myself.

No sales pitch from you which supports my experience with you and why I will be recommending you to others.

I wish you the best in your business and family!
From a happy customer,
Nancy</review>

This is my favorite local spot for fresh fruit treats. I most often come here for their torta special, a torta with the agua of the day and chips for about $7. The owners are really sweet people and it’s a joy to come by either on my lunch break or for a sweet treat.<//review>

< Review>
Bionicos are awesome, and they have a torta combo that is affordable and very good. You get a drink, chips, and sandwich for 6.00. I like the sandwich cold since the hot sandwich wilts the vegetables and makes them warm.< /Review>

<text>I've tried many, I mean many bionicos and this is the only place that satisfies me. Super fresh fruit. Till this day (after 10 years of coming here) the fruit has always been on point. I appreciate places that take priority in cleanliness and freshness.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>We have been with Worldwide for many years. The whole process with the company is a breeze from start to finish. The women in the office and the service tech Don are always kind. Don has been servicing our machine for years. He’s always progressional, nice and kind. We’ve used different companies in the past but worldwide goes on the top when it comes to service. If you need help deciding who to choose I’d pick Worldwide. Thank you for great customer service and products!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Text>We had an issue crop up with our Emission machine and called for service. Frank called me back 10 minutes later to say he would be out the same day to look at our machine. Frank was at our shop, fixing our issues a half hour later. I couldn't have had better service. Thank you Frank for your super fast and knowledgeable service.<//Text>< Pics>

I have had a opportunity to work with wwe and every technician has been good, but the the one they have now (Don) has gone above and beyond helping me and my company. I can't say that about the manager who works for them he has NO business working there, I have dealt with him just a couple of times and he was rude, unappreciative and did NOT want to help me with my problem! He (John) should be FIRED<//Review>

A great and professional job done by Ben, one of the worldwide techs who has come and fix my equipment.  He is very knowledgeable  not only to troubleshoot problems but also on fixing them. Worldwide should use him to train some other techs who have tried and done their best to do their jobs as well, but are still lacking either experience or OTJ T.<//text>

George and Kenny from Worldwide ATL!! is very professional and reliable when it comes to any service rendered from these great gentlemen. They both bring a ready mindset to solve the issue at hand when the station needs to be serviced. I know that when the Dekra station needs help we can count on either guy all the time.
Excellent service everytime!
Thank George an Kenny!!! 🤝🏾< /review>

Minh came to our shop to help complete the set up for our inspection machine. He was very professional and if we had any questions he would answer them without hesitation.

<text>Love this company and doing business with them. Our first machine lasted almost 10 years and that is running just about 7/24 in a shop environment that gets into the low 100's in the summer.We got a brand new unit this year and are loving how functional it is. It is even faster than the original unit and now we can use the internet to transmit data instead of having to have a dedicated phone line!. Steve Clark is our service tech and is amazing to work with and supper responsive to any and all our questions.</text>< Pictures>

Wendy is an exceptional technician.  Her superb professionalism sets her apart from any other service technician I’ve dealt with  the last 30 years.  Wendy‘s expertise results in  a quick and thorough repair & back on operating status of the machines she repairs. Her initial diagnosis, fixes and follow ups, I suggest she qualifies as  top tier In her industry.  She’s the “On Call Doc” of choice when a desperate service call is made to corporate.  Keep up the great work in Vegas.  You are the best!!<//text>

So glad that we switched our smog OIS unit to Worldwide a couple years ago. Rarely have any issues and if we do Worldwide service is very good. Their technician Ben is very knowledgeable and always fixes the problem. Definitely recommend their OIS machine< /Review>

I own smog business in San Jose, CA for 20 years. I purchased my BAR97 machine in 2017 from Worldwide. Machine has been very reliable so far. When I have called for service I get a quick response. Their technician Ben is very professional and always resolves my issues. I am glad I choose Worldwide</review>

Matt at Worldwide Environmental is the best. Any time I call him with an issue he is there for me and my company.
He always answers the phone and is fixing whatever problem we have the same day. Hard to find a person or company that takes care of their clients as well as him and Worldwide.</text>

Great family owned and operated company. Had issues with my machine and the team went above and beyond to make sure I was up and running to tend to my regular customers. If your in the smog check industry you know its part of the business equipment will need repair at some point.  I'm glad I made the decision to use Worldwide to as my vendor for smog check equipment. Thank you Mike and Will for your dedication to your customers!<//Review>

We purchased a Worldwide emissions machine about 14 months ago for our Subaru dealership and were happy with the machine and the service we received. We then purchased 2 more for our sister Nissan store and the machines and technicians have been nothing but excellent.
When we had a small issue with the machine last week it was odd that we couldnt get through to the help phone number that was always answered promptly in the past. After sending an email to the company, I was immediately contacted by a technician and then received a follow up call and email from Will Delaney, Director of Business Development and one of the owners sons, apologizing and explaining they had a problem with their phone lines and were working to resolve it.
The issue with the machine started Thursday afternoon before Memorial Day and by early Tuesday morning Frank the technician was here and had us up and running in about an hour and the repairs were covered under warranty. Great service, great company. Would highly recommend them for emissions testing products.< /text>

They just work ! Just like anything else . I will need some work done and I call in and they send out a Tec and it gets repaired with out a bunch of up selling and the Tec's through the years have been great . The tec they have now is just amazing and never use's a excuse . He comes in asks what the problem is and goes to work ! They even keep him stocked up with the parts to repair the machine so he does not have to return . Just a great company and great repair Tec's .<//Review>< Date>

These two women in this company should be fired from there job immediately just for making lies up to a customer . So in future to anyone who is reading this please please record your conversation that you have with this company so that you have proof so people like this will be held accountable for there actions and lies< /review>< pics>

We bought this machine over a year ago at the very beginning of the transition in PA from dial up to cable internet.  We had high hopes of faster speeds, faster testing, and more reliable service than our 27 year old ESP dial up machine, boy were we disappointed. This is the absolute worst emissions machine on the market. The machine is so cheaply made its unbeliavable. The computer itself is a micro computer that sells for 125 dillars from chinese websites, the machine costs 6k. It constantly has communication problems, the fuel cap tester had already failed inside of 2 months.  The service reps are useless, and not knowledgrable. Now it appears this company has completely vaporized, cannot access their website, their phones don't even ring. I want my 27 year old, dial up machine it was way more reliable and was made way better.<//Text>

I just want to say we have had a great experience with the new equipment that we started using a couple weeks ago. The tablet is easy to use and the test is a lot faster then the previous equipment. I am glad to hear that we will be saving money with the transaction fee this company will charge us for the inspections. Great company!</text>

worse service ever. They have a mess at accounts receivable. They put on hold accounts when nothing is owed. Personnel don't talk to each other so they don't update records and information. They do quick fixes on the equipment so it will keep breaking again and again. They're prices are extremely high.  I don't recommend doing business with them to anyone. They honestly suck.<//review>

PA emissions machine is junk. We got 2 about a month ago and have not gone a single day without both of them having failures. Every day the machine needs to he rebooted and recalibrated multiple times in a row before it reads correctly. Communication issues on almost every single test that is run. I would go back to our old dial up machine in a heartbeat. That's like saying this VHS tape has better picture quality than this brand new blueray. The desktop part of the machine has a mouse and keyboard, but not enough room for both at the same time. And forget any area to write or set paperwork, you'll need to buy another standing desk for that. It's like they wanted to make sure the whole thing was sp terrible that they built in redundancies to guarantee awfulness. Clearly these machines are not programmed or physically designed by anybody who has any clue how they are actually supposed to be used.</Text>

<review>Service from this company is unfortunately terrible.  We're in Missouri and required to use them for our inspection equipment.  Tablet often goes down during the busiest time of the day, tech support is only provided on-site and it generally takes at least a day or two for a technician to arrive.  Often there is no definitive resolution.  We have spent eight months disputing an invoice for a replacement tablet, multiple phone calls and messages left, and no one from the company has ever called back.  The tablet provided to us was stated to be shatter-proof and we paid additional for a warranty plan.  The tablet was simply dropped, not from an extreme level, landed face up, did not bounce around or hit anything else, and the screen immediately shattered.  We had to have a replacement and they will not cover it under warranty.  These tablets are not being used in any type of clean IT environment - auto shops are basically hazardous duty environments.  The fact that these tablets cannot hold up to usual usage within the expected environment is unacceptable.<//review>< GmapID>

Their service is the worst. Our $25k machine has been a useless paperweight for about 3 weeks now.  We've placed multiple calls to WEP and every time, we're told that we're on the list, that the tech is in another area, they're short on techs, there's nothing that they can do. We've also left voicemails for managers and no one ever calls us back. My favorite is that we don't have a service contract so we're not priority. Anyone who spends that much money on a machine should be priority! This was one of our concerns when buying machine #3 from them and their salesman PROMISED us that we’d be taken care of. To date, we’ve been taken care of as well as the proverbial red-headed stepchild. This has happened multiple times and every time, it takes nearly a month or more to get this machine repaired! This is the last time we're purchasing a machine from this company and urge anyone considering purchasing one of their machines to steer clear. You're looking at a really expensive headache.<//Text>

I just bought new bar 97 world wide smog machine 3 week ago,
But I already having a problem not passing 3day calibration few times already such a floopy drive error, fuel cap test fail. so I called service call for repair more than 48 hours ago, but they did not show up
and service technician has not been contacted yet.
Technician came third day and he said machine works fine, everything OK. But Im have same problem again. I call the service call again then I have to wait 3days for repair again
If you are going to buy this machine think about it one more time</text>

It has been a few weeks and my machine is still down.

This company is the worst. their machine always break down on us and the repair guy take forever to show up.  the machine cost us 40k, but in the end it cost us a lot more than 40k. we lost a lots of customers because our machine is always need service, at once the machine was down almost 3 months. Can you believe it? 3 months? their excuse was they are low on tech and we dont a service contract with them.  if you care about your business and customers, do not business with worldwide.  i would never recommend this company to my worst enemy!!!< /text>

<text>Thanks to the state of Missouri for awarding this horrible company the contact to manage our emissions testing. Over a week has pasted and there are still "glitches". Shops haven't gotten their equipment, other shops have received faulty equipment, no connection issues and no support. Residents not able to register their vehicles.l because shops cant do the inspections.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Definitely was an enjoyable place! Came in on a Friday night around 7pm and it wasn't too busy. Our meals were about $12 bucks each which seemed pretty reasonable, especially for the area. The meals were delicious. We got the Caspian Panini and the Mediterranean Platter.<//Review>

<Text>We found this restaurant in the town center. It was not crowded at all... We were the only customers who ordered food. We ordered six plates it took them around 15 minutes to prepare. Customers service was ok... not the best... Food was also ok but for some plate they were too much of some vegetables. Some vegetables are not fresh and are coming from can. Suitable for vegetarian. It's bit sad to put 3 stars because you do not find such places anywhere else. I still recommend this Iranian restaurant.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPU-8jNkBQEx27x34bA3rQOSmE-2ADL1zzkzIpq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZPmSpxmxJeOWIQAtiiWkDfGvKgpBY16cqkTHu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

This is absolutely one of my favorite places to eat in Monterey. Its organic food (it's hard to find organic  restaurants) that taste great and it's not like any other food around. I'm sooo happy they're open again!</Review>

Loved the rice bowl with eggplant stew and flatbread with hummus & veg.  Rosewater lemonade !  So good.  And the best baklava I have ever had.  I felt elevated eating here.  The service was humble and kind.  All around good vibrations and good food.  I'll be a regular.  Go in and feel the love.<//Text>

<text>Delicious, fresh, reasonably priced, and friendly happy, helpful people who work there. They’re even pretty quick, to boot.

Mostly though, the food was very flavorful, lots of savory taste coming from the spices and herbs and sauces. Fast service to boot!</text><name>Preston Parry</name>< rate>

This place is well worth the money, considering the top quality ingredients and the portion sizes. I was hella satisfied. I believe the man who took my order to be the owner, and it is obvious that man cares about his food, and the customer eating it. Thank You for being in Monterey, Saffron Cafe!</text>

Delicious food with good portion sizes, and the owner and staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I had a ghormay sabzi basmati bowl, cardamom tea, and stuffed dates. The owner even asked me if I wanted a second helping of the stew. Highly recommend, even if you're not a vegetarian (I'm not).<//review>

Delicious, wholesome food at a great price. The majority of the menu is gluten free and vegan, which is hard to come by around here! They also have really good house made iced tea and the owner and staff are very friendly!<//Review>

They have paninis, flatbreads, rice bowls and soups and salad. You can also do half and half with soups or salads.
The Mediterranean panini and Marrakesh flatbread are a must have. We also tried the Caprese panini and Caprese flat bread which were equally good. Have all this with a side of hummus or one of the other mouth watering small bites which come with bottomless serving of freshly made warm Pita. The pita were amongst the best I've had, very soft and fluffy. Would surely recommend this to anyone coming in this area and looking for a good place for lunch or brunch or quick bites.</Review>< Date>

<review>This place was alright. We ordered a salad and the beets were a bit wilty and mushy. I also ordered he falafel. The sauce it came with tasted a bit old and a little fermented like it had been sitting there for a while. They were out of the first two things I’d ordered since they get a lot of ingredients from the international market when they are in season. Otherwise, the falafel was great and the paninis looked excellent!<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvgBR1wym0G4Ou33cTligpfoXDgs9CXviMQ98q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9e0iQqmHaWQirDATuZJSs_tXANTuhDE_mOZkF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

This places was wonderful. There's something that you just can't fake about a family owned business that cares. The gentleman that took my order was kind and attentive. I ordered stewed vegetables and saffron rice dish (simple, but flavorful and fantastically aromatic!), a baklava (very sweet, came 3 to a box...I ate all 3 by myself) and delicious lemonade that had a hint of rosewater in it. If you've never had a refreshing beverage with rosewater in it, oh my - are you in for a treat!
When a proprietor of a food establishment brings food out to your table, makes sure you have flatware and sincerely asks how the food is, it makes me feel genuinely taken care of.
I will be back when I return to Monterey!
Thank you!</text>

<Text>Everything we ordered was great. We ordered the roasted veggies, falafel, dolmas and hummus and ordered more food after. Even the kids loved the falafel and hummus and they've never eaten falafel before today.

If you're looking for some good vegetarian food definitely a great spot.< /Text>< Pictures>

The cafe is cozy and is designed for family friendly environment. Highly recommended!!  Their lemonade does not have its traditional taste but delicious nonetheless! Try their delicious tea as it is in their Persian culture as they're very proud of their tea making. Try this place and you will walk away being very satsified.

Excellent fresh, vegetarian food, good service, incredible portions.  Picky eaters beware - even though you can select specifically which vegetables you want in your bowl/salad, they will put a sizable pickled garnish salad on top of your food. Just tell them "no" in advance. Oh, and skip the vegetable soup.< /Review>

I enjoyed the experience but it comes with an asterisk. My expectations were from the descriptor of Mediterranean which is true so I expected Falafel, which is one of my favs, but they don't make it. I assume it is based on their stance of providing healthier options but not sure as the staff couldn't explain it (staff should be able to explain this). Food was okay, the rice was undercooked for my taste but the mains were not bad. Lots of vegan options for sure so that was a big plus. Very much a healthier take on Mediterranean and as long as you understand that then it will be an easier to manage.<//Text>

Finding a place that has vegan options is rare around here. I was told that the soup of the day was always vegan when they first started. I came in one day and asked what there soup was and it had dairy in it. I also asked the owner if there was dairy in the bread once and he made a snarky remark that the bread is bread. I don't think that's a good response to someone that is allergic to dairy and is concerned about not being sick. 2 stars only because the staff other than the owner was nice and accommodating.< /Text>

<rating>3< /rating><text>Tastes good but WAY overpriced for what it is. My bowl was almost entirely rice. It also included a small amount of Salad Shirazi in the dish, which was not clear from the menu, so beware if you have any allergies to cucumbers, tomatoes, or onions. The stew was really good, but there was so little of it that charging $12 for this dish is almost a crime. It should cost $6, at best. (I got it delivered, so after fees, etc., I paid over $27 for this and a tea only.) Really needs about twice as much stew to justify the cost or to even be considered an actual meal.</text>< user>

<Review>They have wide choice of good vegan food! One of the waitresses was a young girl maybe not even teen, which changed the portions in my ordered plate because what I ordered was half finished so "I hope it is ok otherwise just tell me". Tables were quite dirty and so the restroom. Moderately expensive. I took a rice bowl and it was very good, especially for a vegan choice which I m not used to at all. The person who was with me took another choice of rice bowl which was not good at all, very dry and just not tasty.< /Review></record>

<Text>I choose this place because it was near the conf center where we're staying, had several vegan options, and a dog friendly patio. Service was very nice, gracious, and helpful, especially when I asked for vegan options. The lentil and veg soup tasted homemade, with a slight spice kick to liven things. The Persian eggplant dip also tasted homemade and mashed by hand like how my Iranian friend makes it.  Both served with toasted pita bread upon request. I also got the Artisanal salad to go, which is a very large serving and he was very generous with the toppings. If we come to Monterey again we'll be back!</Text><Time>1568691758241</Time>< name>

The whole restaurant is Vegetarian/Vegan and boy is it delicious! It's a mixture of Persian and Mediterranean food with a dash of "Love". What I mean by that is that the owner has definitely put some care into every dish, it's very obvious. What was the best part was that everything is priced reasonably!

We came here and ordered eggplant stew dish, a bowl if soup and a few other items and they were all delicious. We loved Persian tea and the baklava was to die for!!!

All in all it was a fantastic experience and we walked away with a great memory of what it was like to dine at this great place.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

One of my favorite locations for quality mediterranean food. I love this place. Had a friend come into town and asked me to take him here again. Bring your hunger - portions are large.</Review>

I come for the veggie cheymeth stew over rice, hummus and pita and the rose faloodeh which is rose flavored shaved ice with thin rice noodles. Perfect on a warm sunny day.

Will come back to try the baklava and soft serve.</text>< Pictures>

I had a salad, which is custom made and includes any toppings you want. It was very good and filling, but I think they could have a few more options when it comes to greens, like arugula and kale. Other than that, I had no problems. The employees were nice and the shop was well-maintained.</Review>

Best Cafe in Monterey. We're lucky to find this place afternoon.
Service was perfect and very friendly! We ordered a soup and a 'create-your-own salad' and we really enjoyed the generosity and the fresh vegetables we found!
Don't hesitate and skip other fancy restaurant in town to enjoy a really healthy meal!<//review>

One the only fresh and healthy restaurants in downtown Monterey. If you're looking for vegan, vegetarian, or simply something not loaded with sugar, this is the place to-go! I absolutely love their house salad. It's loaded with olives, feta, croutons, cucumbers, onion, tomatoes, and this amazing dressing (possibly Tahini?). Anyway, it's to die for and pairs well with any of their panini's (my favorites is the caprese). The staff is hospitable and helpful.</text>

My husband and I (both vegan) stumbled upon Saffron and were so glad we did. We had a bowl with Persian stew plus rice etc. Plus mezze selection to share. It was delicious; really tasty/full of flavour and filling while still being healthy  without leaving us feeling heavy or like we'd over-eaten.

The team there were so lovely and pleasant. I can't recommend it highly enough.< /review>

Great vegetarian /vegan restaurant .
Usually when we go to these type (pure veg) of places we really feel we're giving up quality but this place was awesome. The service was wonderful and kind.
Great Persian cuisine for a great price.

Saffron Cafe is a vegetarian/vegan cafe that serves Persian and American style food. I don't usually like vegan or vegetation food but this place is great. The Persian stews are phenomenal despite not having butter in the rice or meat in the stew. The potato salad and dolmas are the best I have ever had. The place is kid friendly and reasonably priced. If you are looking for something to cleanse your palate after eating at all the local bar and grills, this is the place. California fresh cuisine at its best.< /review>

I don't share any of the positive sentiments from other reviewers. It's small portions for a high price. Their specialty rice bowls are unimaginative, dry, and bland. Cashiers presumably double as janitors as tables were not bussed and garbage cans were overflowing.</Review>

<Review>For the last two months I've been walking right by this little cafe thinking it was another in a growing line of emerging, commercialized, *meh* quality Indian fast food restaurants.  Knowing that the best Indian restaurant in Monterey was only 5 blocks away, I could not be bothered to spend my money there.

Boy was I surprised.

Today, I found myself hungry and caught in the 2:00-5:00 black hole of restaurant closure.  Not willing to succumb to the pressure of Subway, I decided to give Saffron a try.

My assumptions were SO wrong!

First of all, it is not Indian.  It is an organic, vegetarian, Persian cafe whose quality is on par with Bay of Pines.  (If Bay of Pines was Persian and into the order-and-go market, they would be Saffron).

Second of all, I spent less than I usually do at any of the other fast food places in the Alvarado area (i.e.: Taco Bell, Subway, Round Table, etc).  For the same cost as a meatball sub meal, I got a rather large falafel panini with cucumber salad and cardamom tea.

If you can't see the difference between those two meals...please, just go to McDonalds.

I often whine about my fast food consumption and justify it with an excuse of availability.  Unless I want to brave the Trader Joe's parking lot (*😱*), getting an organic, cost effective, quick, wholesome meal is impossible.

Saffron remedies that problem.  Given their availability on the Yelp 24 ordering app, all I could do was ask myself:  "What the **** was I doing wasting my money on crap?"

Everything we tried was exceptional: falafels, hummus, yogurt mint cucumber dip, falafel panini, oven baked vegetables (carrots, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, tomatoes, etc), walnut stuffed dates, baklava, cucumber infused water and a rice dish I can't name.

Everything was better than anything I could find on Alvarado...or Cannery Row for that matter.

So, if you are looking for  excellent, culturally rich, healthy, organic food that's priced comparably with the usual fast food restaurants; Saffron is your place and we need more of it.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It's been three days since it opened. That's why the farmers' shops run ice cream samples on the road the day Farmers Market stood. It's a vegetarian cafe, and I ordered an Eggplant Sandwich ($ 7.95, never tried it, but the eggplant in the sample I showed was huge, but it was actually very thin and small, so I was disappointed. Made ice cream. Soft ice cream is just a common flavor and it's got a full ball for $ 3.95. The eggplant sandwich was good with the pesto sauce and the feta cheese with the olive oil. I also got some potato salad on the side. But Dipping Season Young ... It's overly expensive and expensive. He asked me if I wasn't going to eat the original bread and baked half of the pita. The potato salad we had already eaten on the side comes with Greek yogurt and hummus made from chickpeas. It's an existing food but I don't know the difference. The space is tidy and there are not a lot of tables, but the atmosphere is good. There is also a salad bar to choose from. The service has just opened and the owner is here so it's nice and nice. It's the first review I've opened to leave you 4 stars. But there's no price, no taste, no menu, nothing special, so it's unknown how successful it will be. (If it weren't for the first start, I'd have given you three stars that nothing would be impressive.)

개장한지 삼일째 되었답니다. 그래서 그런지 파머스 마켓이 서는 날 인도계 주인이 도로에 아이스크림 샘플을 돌리며 호객을 하더군요. 채식주의 까페인데 전 Eggplant Sandwich($7.95, 한번도 안 먹어봐서 시켰는데, 전시해놓은 샘플 속 가지는 엄청 큰데 실제는 아주 얇고 작아서 좀 실망스러웠어요. 주의를 요합니다)와 디핑 트리오(Small Bite Trio, $6.95)를 시켰고 동행인은 아이스크림을 시켰어요. 소프트아이스크림은 그냥 흔한 맛이고 $3.95에 볼 한 가득 줬네요. 가지샌드위치는 페스토 소스에 페타치즈가 올리브 기름에 지진 가지랑 맛이 잘 어울려 좋았어요. 사이드에 약간의 감자 샐러드도 나왔구요. 그런데 디핑 시리즌 영... 넘 시시하고 비싸네요. 원래는 찍어먹을 빵도 안 주는 건지 나중에 물어보고 피타 반쪽을 구워 갖다주더군요. 아까 사이드로 이미 먹은 감자샐러드에 그릭요구르트, 그리고 병아리콩으로 만든 하머스(Hummus)가 나옵니다. 기존 음식들인데 이곳만의 차별성은 잘 모르겠네요. 공간은 깔끔하고 테이블은 많지 않지만 분위긴 좋아요. 골라먹는 샐러드바도 있어요. 서비스는 막 개장했으니 주인이 나와 있어 당장은 친절하고 좋네요. 오픈 첫 리뷰라 번창하시라고  별 4개 남깁니다. 하지만 가격이며 맛이며 메뉴며 특별한 건 없어 얼마나 성공적으로 장사가 될지는 미지수네요. (첫 개시가 아니었으면 인상적일 것 없다고 별 3개 주었을 거예요.)< /Review>

Kinda a time waster when the people in front of me don't know Peet's "lingo" for ordering. Also at the register is lacking some common sense; no ability to decipher simple misuse of words commonly used at any other coffee shop. Or maybe some people are just childishly to stubborn causing a constipation of customers walking out with coffee. 😎If you got time head on in!😃 The baristas are great!😉< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<review>Love the Peet’s brand and this location is exceptional. Roomy, yet cozy layout which does not feel packed even when it’s very busy. The staff is super kind and hard working. Very accommodating and quick. Easy to find parking and nice music playing inside.<//review><username>David Brenner</username>< resp>

The baristas are always so nice and make the best latte! I always mobile order and they are so quick. They go above and beyond to be cheerful and welcoming when I come in at 6:30 AM tired and grumpy. Makes my morning!< /Review>

Coffee was great- wait was a little long. It seems they got hit with phone orders & walk in orders all at once. It appears  there was only 1 barrista  making espresso's at a time? We waited 30min  for our coffee- a sign of a true Peetnik!</text>

You guys should open up your bathrooms if you are serving coffee.  Everyone is wearing masks and distancing.  We are also supposed to be washing our hands and stuff.  And we are drinking coffee and need to pee.</Text>

<review>I wonder if that adorable little Bantam rooster still lives all alone in their parking lot. I wanted to rescue him but nobody would help me from the counter....boo. They're no fun.

<user_name>Brennan McGee</user_name><Text>Stopped in here after a funeral, and ordered coffee with my parents. Our coffee was very bitter and scorched, so we went back in, and asked it to be remade. The girls at the front were very nice, but the barista Kevin replied “Well you’re gonna need to wait a second” snapping at us. He then threw things around the bar area, and slammed our drinks down on the table. My mother’s drink was half foam, and mine was made incorrectly. My mom replied to him “that’s not what he ordered, please make it right”. He snapped at us, saying “well that’s what it said, iced latte!” I told him no, iced americano. He then rolled his eyes and huffed “fine whatever” threw the coffee I’m the trash, and sloppily put my coffee together. Once it was done, he slammed it on the table, partially spilling it. I will be contacting the manager and HR, and update this with their response. Nobody should be treated so poorly.<//Text></record>

Good consistent coffee. I will always come here over Starbucks but the only downside is they are always packed which is a good thing I would think.< /Review>

Hyatt place to hang out, get some laptop-ing dinner, or just enjoy a cup of coffee. Coffee is fine, pastries are acceptable, and the staff is friendly and talkative. This location had ample room for small group chats, two-tops, and several comfy chairs. They are power outlet along most of the walls, too.

A 5min walk from Sonoma square, but well worth the hike.<//text>

I've been sitting here for about an hour now and I witness one of the employees cleaning the patio with a hose! My immediate thoughts, "Aren't we in a drought?! Why is she spraying down the patio wasting so much water?!" Of course, I don't have the courage to tell this person face to face so, I hope that this message gets to her somehow and a new practice is adopted please.

< Review>
I like this place.  I play tennis, so 22 courts which are well kept have always been the main draw.  However, this club also has very good fitness/exercise facilities, clean locker rooms and a fabulous cafe with excellent food.   The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that it can sometimes be challenging to reserve a tennis court when the club hosts tennis tournaments.  It would be nice if members could have a few more courts available during those times, instead of the majority of them being taken up by the tournament matches.</Review>

Been a member since 2008. Great facility with 22 tennis courts. I have also been taking tennis lessons from Alejandro Lacruz for the last six years, Alejandro is the "Very Best" at what he does, a great asset to Broadstone Racquet Club!!!</Review>

<review>Great tennis courts all other Sparetime Clubs should model themselves after Broadstone. Not a crack in a tennis court and they have over 25. LED lights are awesome!!!!... couple dead spots in a few courts but I'll take that any day over the canyons at Natomas Sports Club did I mention the lights?....AWESOME!!!!< /review>< date>

Due to covid, i can't use indoors that much . Only tennis courts so for thst the membership is high after discount periods.  Few courts have cracks so they dont fix it until spring,which is not good as we pay money to play in those courts .</Text>

<rating>1< /rating><review>If you have got children between the ages of 7-13, expect them to be stuck in a room that offers mainly a sedentary experience with a TV, Computer games, video games and crafts. Do not expect there to be any fitness activities for your children. Oh wait... they do offer "Family Yoga" once a week at 4:30 (while people are working!).
In fact, when your 10 year old child is sitting on a stationary bike trying to get in some exercise, with adult supervision and correct workout attire/shoes, by simply peddling at a very leisurely speed (and NOT in the main fitness room but in front of the racquetball courts) expect someone to come tell her to get off because she is not 13.
When you go speak to member services regarding this, they will suggest your child go run around and play basketball (she is a girl and this idea is not of interest to her) and/or go play tennis (Sorry but I won't send my daughter outside ALONE to some far off court to play Tennis in order to get exercise. And also, how do you play tennis alone?
OH and regarding your suggestion for Basketball, my husband did come with my 7 year old son to play last Sunday around 10:00-10:30; they were kicked out of the basketball courts due to Senior Citizen Pickle ball games.
As a result, we have already joined the new gym that is opening in Folsom. They will be offering mind and body enrichment classes for children which include, but are not limited to: Bootcamp for kids, tumbling, Cheer, Yoga, Martial Arts, Arts and Culture classes... just to name a few things. Broadstone does not offer anything for my 7 & 10 year old children, besides sticking them in front of some electronic entertainment. I am so done with this gym!!!!!!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>The gym is fair  and it's not an amazing place. The customer service is OK. Their equipment is pretty old and they need to update it.
The personal trainers suck if you are enough sleep or you know how to work out and you want someone to just push you a little bit more. They are great for overweight people who have never worked out in their entire life. The personal trainers are average people were there to train you with the simple stuff.   The club makes a lot of money on the personal trainers. I bought a 12 session personal training.  I used three with one instructor who did not know his muscle groups. He thought doing military press was working the back muscles. Then I switched to a skinny girl who could barely lift 25 pound plates.    When I worked out with her and put more weights on she was shocked and impressed. She wasn't helping me much.    Again if you have never ever gone to the gym and may be helpful to take if you sessions with a personal trainer but I understand that they are basically making the club a lot of money and not helping you very much.    If you want a great trainer find one who competes for a living and who lives the role not just talks about it and comes to the gym and collects his measly $20 an hour when they are training you.    I use voice to text so please excuse me if there are typos</review><user>108845629813108472883<//user>< Rating>

I joined BRC in 2006 and have consistently been impressed with their playcenter (infants to 6 year olds) and kids club (7-12). I have children that are currently in both and one more that has aged out. Throughout our family's time there, it has been comforting to know my kids like to go to Broadstone just as much as my husband and I do. They have everything there!! Tennis and Racquetball courts, a full size basketball court, great fitness equipment and classes and even a cafe. The food is incredible and healthy. This place definitely has a second home feel and it is really nice to have a bunch of like minded families as members to socialize with whether in the lobby or at swim team practice as this is home to the Broadstone Barracudas.< /text>

<review>August 2016: Had a terrible experience with the kids tennis class' instructor Jana Acri. Not only her classes were extremely boring for a 5 year old kid (she had them take turns jumping on the floor ladder for half the class!), she was rude, and a borderline bully as an instructor. Her teaching instructions were not clear and when kids failed to follow her instructions, she kept saying that they need to pay attention, asserting various sorts of "punishments" on them, like sending them to the back of the line without taking a turn at whatever exercise they were doing.

My son told me that day that he hated tennis. Since we quit her class mid-session I've met several other parents who told me that they had a similar experience with that coach.

June 2017 UPDATE: : Raised my review from 1 to 5 stars to reflect updated experience. For the past 10 months my son has been taking tennis classes outside of Broadstone Racquet Club since the club only has 1 instructor that teaches 4-6 years old age range and we didn't want to go back to her. However, a few weeks ago we were able to put him into the next age range group (7-9 years old) class and that experience has been wonderful. His new coach Dennise Chauvet is really great. She has the perfect (for us!) balance of praise/discipline and techniques/games. Calm and professional, Dennise has her students' attention and respect. We are very happy with our tennis situation now and are grateful to another great coach at the club, Alejandro LaCruz, who was extremely helpful in finding a solution for our family so that we can all enjoy our tennis at the Broadstone Racquet Club.

Thanks to Dennise and Alejandro, we are now fans:)))<//review><Gmap_id>0x809ae5ad929d85df:0xd975a8d0ee60c9f9< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I hardly write reviews for places I have been, but my experience at this specific location drove me to write this today. I called 3 other UPS locations to try and get my fingerprints done, and each one told me that their technician was out or their machine was down. I decided to try my luck here since I had little to no options; and boy was I surprised at the amount of professionalism, courteousness, and all around care of all the employees who work here! When doing my prints, the machine was giving me a difficult time and the whole transaction took over 45 min to get done. But in this time, they made sure to go above and beyond to get this done. One employee, who I unfortunately didn’t get his name, brought me a chair to sit when he noticed how long it was taking. Another even went as fat as contacting the maker of the machine to see if we could solve this issue. I even offered to give the employees an incentive of Starbucks for their time and help yet they turned it down. I am very very much happy with this experience and am going to be recommending anyone and everyone who needs any kind of postal need to this specific location! I can not reiterate how surprised I was at the fact they every single person in this location went above and beyond to make sure I was helped even if I made a mess and took up a large part of their day! I drove an extra 30 min to reach this location and I do not mind doing it again if I need too. Once again thank you to every single person who works here!< /review>

This is one of the best UPS Store locations I've visited.  The staff are always friendly and genuinely seem like they want to help you with whatever brings you in. Shout out to Abdi in particular for going above and beyond to help me out during my last visit!< /review>

I like coming here. The staff is friendly and professional. No one talks as if they’re yelling at you like the postal annex down the street.
I give it a 4 star because the store does need some improvement. Seem rather dull.</review>

<text>One of my favorite locations & go-to spot for my Amazon returns. Staff is always helpful courteous & friendly; even when they’re busy with a long line they still take the time out to greet & acknowledge your presence. Mailing transactions are quick & efficient.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>This place is top notch. Been here a few times and everyone is super friendly! They also knock out lines quick!

A worker there unfortunately got a rude customer and she was just completely ignorant. He did an awesome job of reminding her to keep her face covered(gotta love Karens these days)  and trying to delivery the policy. But this lady was a complete jerk. Keep your head up ☺️.

Thank you to everyone working and doing an amazing job especially during these tough times. You guys rock!< /Text>< Pictures>

Best, most helpful staff I’ve worked with at any UPS Store. I’ve had mail boxes at 5 different locations and this group has a great attitude and make it a pleasure to walk in and do business. Even when it’s busy. Had to move again and I’m going to miss the friendly professionalism.<//Review>

Apoorna helped me earlier this summer, when UPS lost a package I sent to Boston. The UPS phone and online customer service teams were poor; providing very incomplete information, after repeated contacts. Finally, after 6 weeks of lost time, they said I had to follow up with the UPS Store from where the package was shipped. Apoorna assisted me and I received my refund in about a week!

Today, Apoorna helped me with an Amazon return that was a little more confusing than the usual Amazon return. She guided me through the process with patience and aplomb. Thanks Apoorna! :)</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Wife sent me on a mission to return some Amazon items that had to be sent back. I didn't have any idea how to do that and Derrick working at this location was amazingly helpful. I had 3 items and only 2 links for him to scan and he informed me we were missing one so I finally got that and he was able to make the full return. Shout out to Derrick for all the help.

IMHO this is so far one of the two best UPS stores that I have ever been to. I used this store about at least two times per month since last year, and I observed:
1) the staff are very nice, never rude or arrogant,
2) they remember returning guests,
3) they know the technical details, and they help you to compare options, never tried to market an overpriced option,
4) they are very patient to explain to, and help taping and printing for elderly people.
I will continue to use this UPS store.< /text>

<Review>Absolutely NOT in love with them. Would go anywhere else if I had a choice. Was not handed a receipt because "people usually don't want those". Do people not do their taxes? I don't understand. To be clear, I have never ever been anywhere that did not hand me a receipt.< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Just called to see if a notary was available.  They told me there was. Got there shortly after calling and there was no notary. They told me to come back after the person’s lunch break in about 20 minutes. It’s 5:30 pm. They told me they’d be there until 6:00 pm when I called. Not cool.</review>

Employee started rudely arguing with me over his own mistake which forced me to return to the store. I tried to be civil and leave but the employee kept arguing. Very strange experience. On 2 occasions the employees have been needlessly aggressive. Do not come to this location.</Review>

The staff here seemed helpful and professional, but that’s the only good thing I can say. I dropped a package off on a Thursday and paid for DHL Express Worldwide shipping. The package was expected to arrive at its destination the next Monday. The package did not leave the store until the day of its expected delivery. If you need reliability, this is not the place to go.< /Text>

I came to print a big picture in high quality. the staff didn't really know what to do and how to do it, after two attempts that just came out in a quality of 1920's picture, I gave up. when I got back home I figure out I've been charged 20$ for this nothings and waste of time of their staff!!

I spoke to Phillip who assisted you in the store and he confirmed that the printer is given them issues. I'm constantly cycling out old equipment and replacing it and actually just ordered a brand new Ricoh machine for that store that I think you'll like! The $19.95 hold you see on your credit card statement is a hold to assure you have funds available on you card, but you are in fact only charged for your usage. That usage charge will appear later when the credit card batch is settled and the hold will be removed.

<Text>My online tracking said that my package had not left the shop (4 days after having dropped it off). I contacted online customer service and they told me to call the shop. I immediately did so and ended up getting yelled at for absolutely no reason. I couldn't get more than a few words out of my mouth before this horrible man kept interrupting me, and not listening to the fact that customer service had told me to call the shop! Yes, they might not have had my package, but he didn't have to yell that at me. I hope that they record calls and someone eventually hears how rude this man was. I've never been talked to like that before and was honestly stunned. I will never be using this UPS store ever again.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I would give this store no star but I have to give at least one to make a comment. The staff is rude! When I came in the store, none of them welcome me and just ignore me like air! I understand they were busy doing some other works but at least you should let your customers know that you see them and will help them ASAP. After five minutes standing there, I finally got to speak to one of the staff. But her attitude seems soooo rude and sounds so tired of speaking to me. Plus, I got an email notification saying my package is in this store and ready to pick up, but the rude staff rudely said to me “no, it’s not here yet. Come back at three.” (Without saying sorry) how rude!? So disappointed！<//text>

<Review>I self set my expectations when going to any business that normally would have a line.
I gave my business to the UPS store because it was near an address I was having lunch.
I set my expectation that I may have trouble asking for tape to close the package, I did not need another full roll at home. I also expected a Friday line and grumpy customers. My expectation was way off.
This is what happened:
I walked right up to the counter, the clerk, with a smile, reminded me what paperwork went in the package, which address label to use and handed me my receipt and tracking info before I even started to consider how to ask for a piece of tape.
My package was set out for pick-up by the time I returned from the restroom. Yeah I was even allowed to use the restroom.
This outfit is clean well organized, awesome customer service and the clerks are intelligent and spit on.
The gentleman in the beard; working at 450pm June 20th wS outstanding. Well done everyone.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>Went to the store this evening to send a tire back to the manufacturer (I bought the wrong size). The tire came without packaging so when I printed out the return label, I was a little worried I would have to buy a box and pay for packaging and all that on returning it. Nope :-). UPS folks just stuck that label right on, scanned it, and that was it. In and out in 45 seconds :-). My wife also tells me she has had really good experiences at this store. They are very friendly and helpful. Take the poor reviews with a grain of salt, usually it speaks more about the reviewer then the store...< /Review>< pics>

Looking at other reviews, I'd gone with low expectations but my experience was smooth and will certainly revisit for my future needs. Perhaps one thing to keep in mind is that most reviews are written when customers are dissatisfied, thereby presenting a biased picture</review>

Went there this morning.  Their hours online said that they open at 8AM.  Got there at 8:15, figured I'd be safe.  The hours on the door said they opened at 8AM.  They were still closed, nobody in the store.  Got some coffee, listened to NPR.  When I gave up and left at five till 9, there was still not an employee in sight, with several other potential customers joining me in the confusion.  Whoever runs the opening shift should be reprimanded; it was a major inconvenience, and I was late to work as a result.<//review>

< Review>
Picked up a package today and had dealings with Marshall, who was rude and needs to find a better way of communicating with customers. The only reason a rating of 1 star was given was because I had to rate something. I don't plan on going back to this location.</Review>

It's 8:10 in the morning and the store is still closed. Not professional at all. Wasting my time.< /Review>

{'time': 1464394115848, 'text': 'Hi Chiaokai,\n\nWe hope you will accept our sincere apology for this issue! We know how much of an inconvenience this is for our clients, as well as a financial loss to the business. We do have several safeguards in place to avoid late openings, including scheduling staff at least 15 minutes prior to the posted opening time and carefully tracking their arrivals at the store. Unfortunately there was one day this week in which our opener was stuck due to the traffic accident on the 5 which resulted in a temporary freeway closure, and we were unable to get alternate coverage there prior to the opening time. We regret that this was your experience at our store and hope you will give us another shot! If you’d like to provide an address we’d love to send out a gift certificate for your next visit. Please contact me personally at 858-663-7752 if you would like to discuss this further. My apologies, Dennis Stein Owner, The UPS Store #400 7770 Regents Rd San Diego CA 92122'}< /resp>

(Translated by Google) Excellent service by the staff, although I did not send by UPS for the price to international destinations, in the place they packed my things very well and at a good price. Good parking Easy to reach

I love Thai food and this place makes good Thai food. I ordered online and went to go pick up my food after 20 or so minutes. The workers were confused and stated I never called. I repeatedly mentioned that I ordered over the Internet. They took out a mobile phone and realized I ordered. They said 15 minutes, and carried my food out to my vehicle where I was waiting. Food was good. Customer service was nice.<//review>

Very quaint and lovely place. Loved the duck pho. As usual I ordered too much but again food is usually always good reheated. Lunch for 2 plus dinner for $35? Unbeatable< /Review>

Literally ordered 3 nights in a row the food was so good. The delivery was on time hot and fresh and very reasonably priced. From the yellow curry to the coconut shrimp to the pad Thai to the pot stickers, the papaya salad to the peanut chicken.. Its amazing! You gotta get the Thai iced tea and get the coconut ice cream for dessert. I will probably order from here every single time I come back.< /Text>

< review>
I have been to Champion Thai about a year ago and the food was great. This time around I was deeply disappointed. The curry was watery and the drunken noodles were basically dry with no sauce or flavor.

Very disappointed and will most likely not go back for a long time.<//review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>This small but welcoming establishment doesn't appear to be much else besides a small town purveyor of Asian cuisine, which they are, however the food speaks to something more going on here.

As other reviews will tell you, the service is great, and every single review that says that is absolutely correct. Service with a smile; good, but light conversation; and beverage upkeep made sure I never was without a crisp, refreshing glass of mint-citrus-apple infused water. I'd come back again just for the water, it's really that good.

Then we get to the food. My whole table was given egg drop soup to start with. A small, humble appetizer that was seasoned really well and had me draining the bowl in seconds. I then ordered a lunch special combination plate. All plates come with white sticky rice and a small, simple salad. Then you get two choices of entrees, of which I opted for yellow curry and Thai Grilled pork. The curry might be the best curry I've had from a small town place like this. The soup on its own was so flavorful, but add to it well cooked and seasoned chicken (the protein option I went with, but they also have beef, pork, and tofu), and hearty cuts of vegetables, and you've got yourself a real good curry going. The good times didn't end there, as I found myself marveling at the flavor and tenderness of the Thai Grilled pork. Cook just right in thin fillets served sliced, it was a fantastic balance of sweet and savory, with a hint of bitterness to cut through it coming from the char the grill provided.

The time spent here was an overall pleasant and surprising experience, one that garnered a high rating and a family of repeat customers; even if it's only for the water.<//Text>< Pics>

I'm not saying don't eat here. My only position is this isn't my personal preference for Thai cuisine. My friends enjoyed their meals more than I did.

Service was excellent and very friendly.<//review><UserId.>116371594373053284281<//UserId.>< Resp>

<Review>We stopped here on our way back to the Bay Area from Kirkwood ski resort. It's a cute local Thai restaurant. The lady serving that evening was very attentive and pleasant. They had run out of tofu which rather spoiled all the food as the chicken was a bit zombified. We'd go back - assuming they have tofu on hand.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Ive gone to several of the other thai restaurants in Lodi, and this one for me is the best. The flavors were on point, the portions were appropriate, and the service was kind and authentic. The spice was fantastic and the food was wonderful. I had while I was there, the pad kee mao (drunken noodle) w/ pork, the three brothers dish ( a sautee with pork, chicken, and beef and green beans and thai basil and chili), a chicken larb salad, and the fresh rolls with shrimp. I would definitely go back again! and they also do take away!< /text>

Still my favorite Thai hidden gem in Lodi! Being from Seattle I have had my share of amazing thai food, but for a small rown like this I would say it still ranks with some of the top thai spots from back home. I am a huge fan a Pho and there is NONE in Lodi. The chef here always makes me a custome chicken or beef Pho noodle soup when I come in. They have the limes, bean sprouts and basil on the side too! So if you're looking for a Pho like soup in Lodi you can get it here! Go try it out!< /text>

Probably the best autoshop in the La Mirada/Santa Fe Springs area!!! Charlie is super friendly and helpful and also extremely knowledgeable. The work done on my car was done in a conveniently short amount of time both times I've taken my car to get work done and the atmosphere of the shop is very friendly and welcoming. If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would!!!</Text>

<Review>Charlie is a great guy who will let you know what needs and doesn’t need to be done. No worrying about a shop trying to take your money for no reason. I’ll be back for my transmission service when it’s needed.</Review><Date>1622092766842<//Date>< username>

Charlie and his crew are the BEST.  Always do fantastic work.  These guys really know cars.

Charlie is a straight shooter ... he will tell you what needs to be repaired and what can wait.

You can tell just by talking to him that his focus is on how great his customers cars runs when they leave there.

I always recommend Brothers Automotive.
Pricing can’t be beat!!!

Thank you Charlie!!!! 😁👍🏻<//text>

I was referred to Brothers Automotive and I'm glad I went. Being a woman makes it hard to get a mechanic I can trust. I fired my last mechanic because of dishonest behavior and was referred to this place. I got first class treatment and felt very comfortable. Thank you for a job well done< /text>

I have always wanted to find a family mechanic for our cars. I am so happy we found Charlie and Brothers Automotive. We have had 3 family cars there so far and couldn't be more satisfied.  Honest, hard work, detailed , quick and friendly  is the service we get. Can't say much else. This is the type of business we like to support.<//Review>

I highly recommend Brothers Automotive for your automotive repairs. My 2006 Chevy Avalanche had an electrical problem that kept draining my battery overnight. Charlie took care of it in less than two hours. Turns out it was my seat cover that would press against my power seat button.  Charlie did not charge me for it since it was a simple fix. This is what I call great customer service! I'm a first time customer and now I will be a regular.<//Text>

I went there for an exhaust, oil change, and air filter. I saw the place online and decided to give it a try and was surprised about the great quality! If you’d like a place with good customer service, fair pricing, benevolent attitude, and professional workmanship, this is the place to go. I had no problems whatsoever; a completely smooth transition. Would recommend.</Text>

<review>I am very grateful for Charlie and his team. I have been looking for a good mechanic to check into the electrical on my Truck. They found the problem and fixed the issue. Some other places were trying to charge me an arm and a leg and keep it for days. Charlie and his team got it done within a few hours at a great price<//review>< Pics>

Anyhow, I checked in with Charlie Squires to see if he'd take a 2nd look at my sons car.  Thanks for being an HONEST shop, couldn't find anything wrong after a through check of the car.  Everyone knows the ONLY person who looks and or works on my cars is my dad, so it was hard to go anywhere else.  Lots of shops/mechanics will tell you all this work needed to be done to make money, it's hard to find honest shops that will not tell you work needs to be done IF it doesn't.  Grateful my sons car is in need of NOTHING at this time, however doesn't mean we won't be back WHEN work is needed   So if you need work and/or inspection... Check out this spot if you want an honest opinion.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Honest. When pep boys said we needed a brand new AC (not true!) brothers was able to fix a part and it works perfect. I trust them 100%. When purchasing a new car they inspected it for me and told me about damage I couldn’t see. Thank god for a mechanic we trust.< /Review>

So thankful to get the recommendation for Charlie at Brothers Automotive.  Now it starts the first time and he was able to fix other problems as well.

Visited with a lady friend on a photo trip, we liked it so much the first night that we went back for another!! Staff was wonderful here, "suite" was excellent and so comfortable!! Loved the free coffee in room and opportunities to actually cook in a real kitchen as well!! Toiletries are nice touch too!! If I ever get back that way, hope the funny day desk man is still there!! Lol. Thank you for letting us fill our ice bags, since we were there when it was 126 summer! Lol.< /text>

<text>I was really worried because I booked so late on a busy Pride weekend... but miss thing I was over done and over pleasantly surprised. The room was nice, updated and spacious also very clean. I didn't even feel the need to use my shower shoes or wrap the toilet The front desk Bela was super nice. Only 4 stars because of some construction that started at like 8am and because I couldn't book to stay again next year.<//text>< pictures>

-Mold in the shower, no reasonable counter space in bathroom
-Too-low water pressure
-Dirty floors with hair and grime
-Poor lighting
-Dirty, marked up, and poorly-patched walls and woodwork
-Itchy sheets and pillows
-The mattress platform was too big and its hard corner was exposed, so a leg injury resulted.  The following night in the dark, leg was injured in the same area which already had a puncture wound and a bump from the previous night
-TV didn’t work
-Fragmented parking</Text>

<text>For the price, it's everything that it needs to be. Sure you're not impressed, but it's not BAD, at all. I had a very comfortable time. The bed could be a little more comfortable, but that would be my only issue. Cheap easy, would definitely come again.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80db1b11c168e8c9:0xc1e390494da3ec9b<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I wanted to bring the following (health) concern to your attention which was handled inadequately and subsequently has affected our vacation.

During our stay from 7/29-7/31 we had booked a single room for 4 people. The single larger room is key for us considering
our family needs. Upon arrival at the location and checking into the room assigned, we discovered a very unsanitary situation.
As you can see from the visual depiction attached, bugs were crawling over the floor, in the bed, inside the pillows, bathtub and everywhere they could go.

When we alerted the reception desk of the situation, they attempted to find us another accommodation, but only the next morning.
While we were happy that the situation attempted to be resolved, albeit it being the next morning, my family was split over 2 smaller rooms now.
Because of the care and concern for my children in a new area, I could not sleep at all, not only because of the air conditioner in this room not working either.

After we brought this to the attention also, the manager on duty mentioned we had no need to complain anymore because they took care of the bug situation. Sure enough, but getting 2 other problems in return is not resolving the situation in my opinion.

While further trying to discuss the situation and finding a solution for our already somewhat affected vacation, there was no attempt made to resolve our situation nor was any compensation provided.

Our vacation unfortunately didn’t turn out the way we had hoped and I am reaching out here to share what the experience has been
both from a quality perspective, health and sanity perspective and the managerial approach taken.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Cleanliness was awful. Dirty spots on walls, under toilet, under sink, and on sheets. Dust on TV and windows. AC is very loud, impossible to sleep at night. But lobby personnel was friendly and polite. Quiet location and close to downtown. Not coming back unless they'll do some huge changes.</review>< Pics>

Very nice place, well cared for, bedroom very large, kitchen is quaint but usable. Bathroom is small and the shower lots of hot water, but does not have a down spout for setting water temp. The owners are caring so if you choose to stay their they are nice.</review>

The inn was decently clean and comfortable especially considering the price. The vending machines where out of service and there was confusion over the booking but the staff were polite and reasonable. The high power air conditioning in the room was a life saver and the pool and spa where pleasant. A perfect hotel if you are looking to not spend very much money.< /Review>

Better than average as the price shows.  I seemed to be in a newer section by the pool.  Wood floors, well appointed, fridge, microwave, comfy.  The AC kept me alive but when it cycled off, I felt the heat...UGH !!  The shower was very nice but no place to put the soap and shampoo.  Tiny bars of soap.  I didn't get a wifi username and password when I checked it.  I didn't need it, but I would have felt better having it.  I'll most likely be back.</Review>

The room was great, the staff friendly, but the wifi was pretty touchy and the water temperature in the shower was difficult to get just right. Also, the hot tub needs to be filtered. But cute and fun!</text>

<time>1521259152324< /time><review>I booked a night with this hotel and the dates were for tomorrow when I began the reservation and when I confirmed it the dates had changed to April 7th without me realizing. I called Expedia and the hotel to see if I could change the dates to what I had originally planned and even though it was an accident and I called immediately after the confirmation page popped up they refused to help me. No refund, no help from their end. The price difference of the two nights was $100, which I was not expecting, which is why I asked if a refund was possible. Not pleased with the service one bit.<//review>< username>

My stay at Knights Inn was great! Nothing too fancy or luxury but good value for money and has pretty much all the basics you need in a hotel. The bed was super comfy with 4 power outlets on each side of the bed. Air conditioned and a big TV with basic cable, free WiFi too. The bathroom had a separate shower. I couldn't figure out the hot /cold situation but luckily the bath tub also had a shower head that I could figure out. Good water pressure. The kitchen had a fridge, microwave and basic coffee maker. No cutlery or plates/bowls (only plastic cups for drinks) but I had my own, so it was ok.
Unfortunately it rained the first 2 days but the people at the front desk were really helpful in suggesting things to do! The location is pretty central, if you have a car there's free parking but I also noticed a bus stop right out the front. I used the pool on the third day - nice big, clean pool with lots of loungers and a shaded area as well. When I stayed it was really quiet and peaceful, no noise from the road or other guests.

Just remember to keep the swipey key cards away from your phone or it will demagnetize them and you'll be locked out!</text>

Reasonably priced budget motel with small, well appointed (albeit a little dated) rooms, a pool, and a jacuzzi just south of downtown Palm Springs.</text>

(Translated by Google) Unfortunately can not follow the good reviews here. Room not nice, bath mini and there is hardly any water. Pool does not look nice. Cleanliness ok but also upstairs.
Inexpensive yes, next time I like to spend more for the room.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Very nice little motel in Palm Springs. The rooms are clean and newly renovated and nice and bright. There is a pool, unfortunately the pool water temperature. But at 45 ° air temperature is not a miracle. The pump was not switched on because of the small number of visitors. Otherwise highly recommended. The reception is very friendly and helpful.

Sehr schönes kleines Motel in Palm Springs. Die Zimmer sind sauber und frisch renoviert und schön hell. Es gibt einen Pool, der leider Badewassertemperatur hat.

And when we asked if we could get a small discount for the disgusting sheets, he just said no,
because the laundry is washed elsewhere
And because of the stain, she's still clean.

Das Motel hat in meinen Augen nicht einmal einen STERN verdient, die Bettlaken hatten ekelhafte Flecken.
Und als wir fragten ob wir für die ekelhaften Bettlaken einen kleinen Rabatt bekommen, sagte er nur nein,
denn die Wäsche wird wo anders gewaschen
Und wegen dem Fleck ist sie trotzdem clean.</Text></record>

<Time>1501951627554< /Time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>(Translated by Google) Nice motel for a stopover between Los Angeles and Joshua Tree! Only 30min from the north entrance of the park and 15min from the south entrance this hotel is also equipped with a kitchenette with a large fridge, an oven and a microwave and a coffee / tea machine! We did not use the pool because we arrived late in the evening but it is with regret that we watched from the room

Sympathique motel pour une halte entre Los Angeles et Joshua Tree ! A seulement 30min de l'entrée nord du parc et 15min de l'entrée sud cet hôtel est aussi équipé d'une kitchnette avec un grand frigo, un four et un micro-onde ainsi que d'une machine café/thé ! Nous n'avons pas profité de la piscine car nous sommes arrivées tard dans la soirée mais c'est avec regrets que nous l'avons regardé depuis la chambre</review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

This location of Whole Foods Market in Campbell is a fantastic location with one exception, they only sell beer and wine. :-(.

The store is on the medium to large size and has a “nutrition section” that I have not yet explored. There is plenty of parking and it is easy to get in and out of the parking lot.< /Text>

<Text>Out of the 5 employees I interacted with while shopping in the store, one was helpful, three were extremely rude, and one was completely indifferent. Such a different vibe from my usual Whole Foods store. This location used to have excellent customer service throughout the early 2000s.<//Text>< Pics>

Tasty bakery with honest buttercreams rather than Crisco armor. Friendly counter staff. Tasty if expensive deli. Seem to be doing reasonably with c19 measures<//Text>

Prices are much better now than they used to be,  especially with a Prime membership,  but it still seems like I walk out with a pretty hefty bill every time I go there. There are a lot of things I have to get at Safeway, I guess those things don't pass the whole foods test or something.<//Review><user_id>101905823029002760442<//user_id><username>Jeff Thomas<//username>< Rate>

<text>I really enjoy this Whole Foods. Even though the lunch/ salad bar was closed, I was able to eat healthy. Organic free range chicken and salad for less than 12 bucks! They also still provide tables outside and plastic silverware.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOylcI5wlc3nyeUkBS6BF7PUku4bC2q8BNLBeRu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

I always come for the clam chowder, which is amazing. This time I went for the seafood cioppino, and it was just as good if not better. If you're in the mood for some good soups, whole foods is the spot ! The small size is also 2 for $7!<//Text>

<text>Its huuge! I've never seen or been to a whole foods as large as this one. And its whole body section was like its own little store, it. was. soooooo cool, all on its own. Until I went in.

Its too bad, that even though the whole body section was like its own little store, its inventory lacked in a MAJOR way. Really disappointing for the size of this store.  :(

It was late Saturday afternoon, when we went, so of course, there was a line to get in, they were only allowing 5 people in at a time.

I have never had a bad experience at ANY whole foods location, but I didn't even have to go into the store and already, a few of the employees had already been unfriendly & a but rude, in a very aloof manner. Which is highly unlike ANY Whole Foods, I have ever been too, incl. other states

I doubt I'll return to this store location. Unless I'm in the area again. Its far. So its highly unlikely, and the rudeness doesn't send the message "Come Visit Us" instead, it was one of "We hate our jobs and we don't care how we treat customers". The quality of products was just a disappointment. Even the varieties of certain products seemed few and far between. It was NOT worth waiting in line and the store didn't seem as bright, cheery or very clean as so many other whole foods locations I have frequented. And the employees werent as friendly or so willing to help, like so many other Whole Foods Stores< /text></record>

<review>The food is good quality and the staff is friendly and helpful. Very busy all the time but they check you out fast. No self-serve checkout nonsense. Not the cheapest place in town - everyone knows the nickname "Whole Paycheck", but easily the best of the upscale grocers in the area.< /review><resp>None<//resp><rate>4</rate><pics>None</pics>< Date>

<text>Customer service at this WF has always been excellent. Everyone is friendly and helpful. But the day after my dog passed away they went above and beyond. They accepted my return on 2 cases of unopened dog food and they gave me a beautiful bouquet. Losing a pet is tough, but their kindness warmed my heart and brought some sunshine into my quiet home. Thank you Whole Foods Bascom!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Date>1541996826983</Date>< Rating>

Everyone was wearing masks. Shelves were fairly full and very few produce areas were empty.  Only complaint was lines were very long with at least 25 people behind us waiting to checkout.</text>

If there's an office party, I shop for the pastries. The blackberry & raspberry are popular at the office parties I attended. Moreover, also, the freshly prepared pizza is really worthwhile!

Also, there's something about the shoppers  who frequent there as well as the attentive staff: For instance, I left my backpack (with wallet, phone, etc.) in the shopping cart in the parking lot, and drove away.

Hours later, I returned to the store to inquire, and  reclaimed my backpack, which had been turned in to the staff by some kind/thoughtful someone. It's one of my favorite stores.

Sadly, I can no longer special order pet food, for instance and there's no "rational" explanation why for the customer.<//Text>

< review>
I really like Whole Foods, it feels like a small family store as opposed to a large chain (even though its Amazon). They tend to have everything you’re looking for and the quality a pretty damn good.
Checkout always seems to be chaos which is the bit I don’t like, I feel that everyone is always searching for their Amazon QR code at checkout and this holding up the line - why in earth Amazon doesn’t make an iOS wallet card I don’t know.

As always, if you found this review useful please remember to like it. If people like the review (whether you agree or not), it encourages me to write more ;)<//review>

The large size of the store is great, but the staff are less friendly and often hard to find than other stores.  I often get cheeses and deli items.  The cheese staff are usually available, but the deli counter can be a REAL long stores.I love the olive bar, but its a bit pricey!  Fresh veggies at this store are good, though not always great.  Nice flower options.  Overall, not bad, but good management could make this into a powerhouse of a store.</review>

Food quality is excellent but the prices is insanely high.  I guess the term "Whole Paycheck" is true...  But the major thing that concerns me is that since Amazon took over slowly I've noticed some less selection and more less-than-polite employees.   They are probably being worked way too much but it's sad seeing Whole Foods slowly going downhill.  I think in the end we will find that Amazon buying them was not great for the store's brand.<//Text>

<review>Tough to rate with new owner. 2 years ago I'd have said something more positive. Employee turnover seems to have increased and sometimes it take three or four employees to answer whether or not they have the item I need or want. they are large stores stocked with lots of items they claim don't have excessive extra chemicals added but I found I still need to read the ingredients label. Hope the new owners get their store policies reconfigured soon for the employees and their customers.<//review><UserId.>107462665558974029669< /UserId.>< Resp>

I really like coming to Whole Foods in Campbell.
The selection of all the foods is really amazing,  I especially like the hot foods,  everything tastes like homemade :)
People there are very friendly. Sometimes I just like to go there to get the sweet treats, they are very delicious!
Thank you for making my days brighter and happier and filled with delicious foods :)< /text>

Amazon has to try harder. Fruit and veggies do not compare to Whole Foods.
At least not when I was there last week.

Great improvements overall.  Still need to improve grade of sushi.  Salmon is not good.  Liked the old sushi set up better.
Overall ... I love shopping there.
Especially everyone that works there.< /review>

Smaller Whole Foods but set up nicely. The non-food section (medicine, clothes, soaps, etc. is in a completely different part of the store than the food parts, which is nice. Great for getting quick burrito or sandwich for lunch, it's set up quite nicely for grab-and-go. Overall, it's nice!< /text>

Never a long line at checkout. Great place to grab a bite to eat from the hot foods buffet or the salad bar. Deli sandwiches made to order, hot burritos that you build, fresh pizza & lots of grab & go ready-made food to eat. The best selection of organic produce & fruit outside the local farm markets. Friendly customer service too!< /Text>

Ramon, Chris, Bryan and the others do a fantastic job, and, really, so does everyone in the store.

This location is pretty big for a Whole Foods. Great selection of vegetarian and vegan stuff. The bakery and coffee counter are awesome too. Some stuff is absurdly expensive, but the vast majority is about the same price as Safeway. If you're vegan or vegetarian, this place is your church.<//text>

<Review>This is the Whole Foods closest to me, and just so happens to be one of my favorites.  This place isn’t as up to date as other locations.  Meaning there’s no bar, no mini-restaurant, and it’s not super huge.  But the Campbell store does have a more hipster vibe to it, which makes it fun.  I usually go for the prepared foods section, and this place always seems to have some of my favorites on hand.< /Review>< Pictures>

I hadn't been to this Whole Foods in quite a while and found I was quite disappointed. The staff were very friendly but didn't have any idea where to find anything. I really like the WHOLE Foods on the Alameda in San Jose much better.<//review>

Whole Foods Market in Campbell is the first place I shopped with ‘healthy’ foods. The quality of meats and produce are extremely good, but the cost is also extremely high. The message the store gives with their prices is ‘only the rich deserve to shop here’.<//review>

The Campbell Location is smaller than most I've been to but you should be able to find what you need there. It can get pretty busy there (or at least feel like it because of its small size). Staff is friendly, location is clean, and items are easy to find.< /review>

<Review>Disappointed that they don't use healthier ingredients to prepare their food.  For example it took them forever to offer cauliflower mash, while the SF locations offered it long before this location did.  And when they did finally offer it, it was filled with unhealthy ingredients so I didn't want it anyhow.  For someone who is vegan, you don't take a nice healthy dish like cauliflower mash and then put dairy milk in it.  What are you thinking?  If you want to add an ingredient to make it creamy, then use coconut milk!!!   And then around the holidays, my favorite is Pumpkin Pie, yet the Whole Foods pie is filled with many unhealthy ingredients so I don't purchase it.  I look to them to set the example of providing healthy quality food, as their name leads you to believe, but it's all just a facade.   And their cookies are all loaded with way too much sugar.  For one, you need to put so much sugar in everything.  And secondly, why are you even using sugar, it is so bad for you, why not sweeten using something like maple syrup or coconut sugar!< /Review>< Pictures>

Spoiled as I remember how Whole Foods use to be. Now even the food bar closes early, was 9;30, then 9:15, now back to 8:30, and now stocked with broad selection of fattier heavy carb foods. Prepared foods as alternative, shelves empty at 8;30 pm.This was a great store that catered to locals with good healthy selections and stocked shelves. Now since "new" corporate took over they are constantly running out of items, with vacant shelves and the selection of items has diminished. Prices have gone up, I can get some of the same foods cheaper in Maui. Milk that use to be in landfill friendly containers has now reverted to non-environment friendly plastic and the freshness date is now "Drastically" reduced compared to other Organics. The staff remain excellent and apologetic.<//review>

<Resp>None</Resp><text>All needs in one store, but the prices are little costlier than the other grocery stores like sprouts. We’ve been a regular customer in sprouts and for a chance visited Whole Foods market located near my house. Really amazed by availability of products as the store belongs to amazon, but the prices are costly who are not having prime membership. For example mushrooms are $5.99 per pound whereas same can be bought cheaper in sprouts. So think smart before buying👍🏻<//text>< rate>

<Review>Like any Whole Foods this is on the high end of grocery stores in terms of prices. They have more exotic and organic ingredients. The quality is generally good and there is a massive selection of almost everything. The store itself has a rather chaotic layout. Its difficult to find what you need unless you've been there before and its usually quite crowded. That said if you just need something very specific and you don't paying a little more its a good place to grocery shop. Surprisingly they have a fairly decent craft beer selection as well.< /Review></record>

This whole foods has one of the best salad bars I have been to.  Great selection of fresh and organic items.  The fresh soups are also good (my favorite is the "black bean").  They also have a good deli that makes large sandwiches and also a burritto bar, which are also huge.  The prices are a little more expensive than the usual grocery and markets, but the food here is high quality and tastes good!</text>

This is now our go to grocery store. I would appreciate more vegetable variety, stuff you might find at a farmers market, but they have all the basics. The butchers, seafood butchers, stockers, cashiers are all very helpful.< /text>

Whole Foods,  used to recycle 🔋 battery,  no longer do. It's big,  but sells everything. A new complaints department or something was added not sure of the new addition. Always  clean and nicely organized.<//text>

Whole Foods' deli section is a game changer. If you haven't already, try some of their Smoked Mozzarella Pasta Salad. But be warned: you'll want to buy it by the pound !!<//Text>

I love this place. I often go here for lunch or a snack.

The prices are high but I guess you only live once. Right?

When you come here try the Einstein at the juice bar. It's great.</Review>

The place has so many tasty and good quality food products. Produce is mostly organic and fresh. Even non-organic items have good quality. The store is expensive but most of the time it is possible to find something on sale at reasonable prices.< /Text>

Staff is very condescending be warned!. The Cafe service should be closed down because they cant ever get the drinks right. I love the Chai latte and they just always give me the regular latte! Almost always, I have to go to another whole foods to get consistency in my drink :(  Even though this one is literally behind my apartment!</Text>

I like the juice bar here. They make everything with organic veggies.  I is a little pricy but it is worth it.

They always get the juice out fast whether there are a lot of people waiting or not.

If you haven't tried it yet I would highly recommend it.< /Review>

This Whole Foods has the whole body section which provides more choices for supplements and body care products. In the morning, they don't usually stock up on all the fruits. Other then that, it's pretty much like every other Whole Foods. Staff here are friendly.<//Review>

Dude really forget the strip club go here..
I would like to thank all those hard-working women out there that are going to the gym and wearing that spandex for everyone to go every witness your beautiful Splendor that is your bottom.  No I never really had this problem before it mainly because I used to shop at Walmart a lot and I never really bothered looking at anyone's bottom because that's all you could see there. But as soon as I came to Whole Foods I realized that less is more.   😂 For example get a bag of chips or some pizza at one of the chains or something else like that that's like mass-produced her basically has a ton of other Cretin eat it and you'll realize you can either eat the whole pizza or the whole bag doesn't matter you'll still feel hungry shortly after. Try that with just a slice of pizza from Whole Foods and you will feel unbelievably full after just one slice!  There is no magic going on not pulling the wall behind your eyes what it really is is good quality food that not only makes you a happier person but honestly I feel ten times better eating here. They say you can't have a pizza day I beg to differ if it's Whole Foods Pizza that stuff might add ten years to your life.  Or you can die in a horrible car crash because you could not stop looking at that woman's UPS Hoops I'm dead... It was a good way to go cheers everyone!< /text>

GREAT customer service is always excellent here. Cahiers efficient, friendly and helpful, AND, people think because it is specialty store, it is higher priced, I felt prices were very reasonable, but still had healthier, better choices.</Review>

Great atmosphere except near closing time.  I don't know of another store that acts like they want you the hell OUT at their posted closing rather than just not letting folks in but allowing those who already are in to finish up in peace.  The way this place puts the pressure on is inexcusable.</review>

Food side needs a re- haul. Hot food is not very healthy. I think whole foods on Soquel takes the cake when it comes to the hot food section. Maybe Campbell can take notes. Campbell staff is friendly but phone service is awful.</Text>

Very dissatisfied.  Loved wf. In the past.  Went yesterday and bought prebagged brussel sprouts.  Most of them had to have bad spots cut out out
It was obvious that they had not  been handpicked because most of them also had some kind of mechanical damage.  Doesn't effect taste, but not appetising to look at on your plate.  I will not buy prebagged produce here anymore.  I like my food to look appetising.</text>

The prices are Whole Foods prices (i.e., too high) but the quality is a disaster. I have bought their made-to-go meals many times and on several occasions i have gotten sick. I should have stopped going there earlier. Be warned, if you get their sushi, youll be playing russian roulette with your own underwear for the rest of your day.

Just okay for a Whole Foods. Quality can be inconsistent. They share a parking lot with some other stores so a lot of cars pass in front of the entrance while people are trying to get in and out. Doesn't seem very safe sometimes.<//review>
