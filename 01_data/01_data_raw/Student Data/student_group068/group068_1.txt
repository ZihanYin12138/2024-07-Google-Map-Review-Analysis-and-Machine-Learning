<Text>Couple of years ago, I went to Santa Clara to visit a Real Estate Agent. During that time I had some mortgage and rental properties real estate tax issues, I had to look for a CPA firm on Google. I found Bhuiyan & Associate, CPA on Google. I was in rush, without appointment, I went to Bhuiyan & Associates, CPA firm in Santa Clara. I was welcomed by Motin Bhuiyan without appointment at his office. After I reached his office. I explained all my rental property tax and mortgage tax issues, He listened carefully all tax related issues and explained me nicely. I  understand how to deduct mortgage interest along with other expenses associated with my rental properties can also be deducted ."
Bhuiyan & Associate CPA is an experience, knowledgeable , professional CPA firm, I ever seen before, who helped my 3 years back Tax.
I am so glad, I found him on time.</Text><date>1616480489209< /date>< Resp>

My CPA with another firm cancelled last minute due to a family emergency and wasn't available before my deadline, so I  Googled CPA and found Bhuiyan & Associates, CPA with great reviews.  Matin was knowledgeable and helpful.  Thank you Matin!< /Text>< Pics>

Motin is not only qualified, but also diligent and hard working as well. He spends time with you, answers all your questions, and works hard to get you the maximum refund. Between March and May he literally sleeps in his office. Where else are you going to find a CPA willing to spend this many hours working on your taxes??< /Review>

Contrary to some of the "1 Star" reviewer's experiences, I have had nothing but cordial and transparent relations with this company. I went in recently to have some complicated taxes filed and was helped by Mr. Bhuiyan personally. Not only did he review everything I had provided in a systematic approach, he also drew upon some resources and deductions I did not know I qualified for. The work was completed, presented, and filed in front of me during the one visit. You know exactly what you paid for and are filing. Mr. Bhuiyan also provided tips and hints on how to help your upcoming tax reductions for the year ahead so you can plan accordingly; priceless.

He was very well mannered and of course the outward appearance of his office seemed what some have quoted as "messy", but again it is tax season and he was extremely focused amongst everything. In terms of pricing, we asked up front and he had a set price without ambiguity or "sketchiness". His pricing is extremely competitive for the area.

His office also provided stickers for the kids as well as snacks to munch on during the duration of the appointment. Parking is convenient and appointments are flexible.<//review>

<review>The tax session was quick and got some good advice.
Was able to get some concrete answers to questions which I was unsure about and couldn't find information online about.
I was also able to schedule an appointment at 7 p.m (i think you can schedule up to 9 pm!) so did not have to take time off from work. Most other firms usually have a 9 to 5 rule so this was really convenient.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Mr. Motin was amazing!  My husband and I were looking for an honest CPA that will work with us to get as much as we can back, yet pay where payment is due without any monkey business.  He was kind, very attentive, and had answered all our questions and concerns.  He also gave us great advice for the next tax year and how to manage our money in a wiser way.  Thank you Mr. Motin!  God bless such honest people like you :)</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I used to file my taxes through other CPAs who would false promise me, I tried H&R Block, nothing comes even close to what Mr. Bhuiyan provides. They give you complete peace of mind and do your taxes according to rules and regulations. Since I have discovered them, whenever the tax season is around I just give them a call. And within hours they file my taxes. This year I gave them my W-2 at midnight and saw their email around 4 in the morning that my work is ready! Highly impressive. I highly recommend them!</review>< pictures>

<Text>My experience with Bhuiyan CPA was good.  created an LLC in 2014 with 2 foreign partners, which made the tax returns more complex than usual. I was expecting, because of the unusual complexity of an otherwise simple return, that I would have to pay a steep fee. but no, the fee was small and I also received a lot of great advice and guidance that might have come with an extra charge at another company.
All in all, having Bhuiyan CPA do my tax returns turned out to be great value for money.
Mohammed provided me with a good tax savings strategies, Keep up the good work. Thanks<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>I wish I could give negative stars. HORRIBLE experience. Not professional at all. Made us wait even after taking an appointment .VERY IMPATIENT just because we are having doubts and we have done a bit of our own research !!! He MISGUIDED us.  Would have made us lose $10k if we just nodded to what he said. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE.<//Review></record>

<Review>My advice to you guys don’t ever trust a cpa especially this guy always ask him what he is doing and how much he will charge you before doing anypaper work with him or you are going to be screwed,thats what happened to me cause am new here in the US and came to study and i was told that he is an honest guy and after i gave him the money and went back home and checked what he have done for me and i knew that he charged me alot for nothing and i could have done it for free cause its just a form you download online and its free and its not even for the taxs and he charged me 200$,
And cause my brother in law told me about him and he deals with him and i had no clue how much he will charge and didn’t ask cause of his reputation but he took advantage of me cause am new to this kind of stuff and trusted him.
And the funny thing after what happened i texted him and told him what you did is wrong and you took advantage of me and charged me alot for almost nothing so his reply was that he have to pay his bills and if i came in different time of the year he would have charged me ALOT CHEAPER and thats specifically what he said.
Bottom line don’t trust him unless you do your research and ask how much he will charge you for anything<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

BhuyanCPA has been helping me with my tax documents since 2007. I am travelling everywhere in the United States but I always knock Mr. Matin, when it’s come to tax filing. He is very organized and patient with my questions. Mr. Matin gives solid advice and take the stress out of tax season. I trust my taxes in his capable hands. Mr. Matin is extremely helpful.

< Review>
I have been using the services of Bhuiyan & Associates, CPA, 2118 Walsh Ave, Santa Clara, CA 95050 for the last many years. Motin at Bhuiyan & Associates is the owner and a very reliable person. I have three W2s in my family, a couple of stock trades and kids's education expenses. All I did was to leave my documents with him for only three days and thats all. He called us for signing the final documents and my tax papers were out with the IRS on-line, the same day, right there. I am expecting the refund soon. I would highly recommend Motin at Bhuiyan & Associates as a reliable person. Just an FYI that he has staff with Viet, Bangla and Spanish language expertise also that can help in personnel or business tax. He charges very nominal amount of fees that are much much lower than other CPAs. That is another reason for maximum benefit by filing taxes with him.< /Review>

<username>Oh Wheaton<//username><time>1426021127392< /time><rating>5<//rating><text>We had a small business that was closed in 2009.  To add salt to injury, the IRS sent us a bill for $500k and a 3 year audit notice.  My savvy business friend said "Get Motin."

Motin certainly masters the audit game.  He knows how to organize and present data convincingly. Motin helped to conclude the audit in 4 months.  It was certainly not a cake walk, Motin delivered the best possible result, "no adjustment." The IRS sent us the refund owed plus interest.

Motin give us our piece of mind back.  Worth every penny!</text>< pics>

<Review>We had a very unpleasant experience with this service. He is not at all professional and kept taking calls in between after making us wait. Did not bother answering our doubts clearly and was very impatient. He would have lost us more than $6k in refund if we hadn't done our own research and gone to the IRS tax assistance centre. Choose this place only as a  last resort.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

The car was clean and in excellent condition.  Check-in was a breeze and the person at check-in was very quick and very helpful.  Drop off was extremely simple and quick.  They were not open when we arrived early in the morning but the young guy working processed our car and drove us to the airport.  Amazing service from start to finish. Thanks.</Text>

I made a reservation specifically for an all wheel drive vehicle because we were going to big Bear Lake. After calling every single week to confirm that they actually had all wheel drive available to rent, on every phone call it was confirmed that they did. Upon my arrival on Tuesday, January 26 at my 10 AM pick up I was told that they do not carry any all wheel drive at all and that they were sorry for the inconvenience. Not only was I extremely upset as I now don’t even have a car to rent but now I’m looking all over in San Diego trying to find an all wheel drive vehicle. To say the least I will never use this company again.</Text>< name>

HORRIBLE!!! First, their address says they’re at the SD Airport but they’re not. I booked 2 months early, then after waiting 30min for a shuttle I finally call for them to send one. The shuttle guy shows up to about 15 people waiting to get a ride to the car place to pick up their rental, and he proceeds to say “hey, I can give you a ride but we don’t have any cars” ...whattt?!?... ya, so, here I am have no choice but to book with a new rental company on the fly for an outrageous rate. GARBAGE!! Never.</review>

We ordered a car online thru our travel agency and had unlimited miles and could drive anywhere in California and when I got there I was informed the car was only for local use and anything over 150 miles per day would incur a fee. When I said our email confirmation said unlimited and anywhere in California i was told I was wrong and when I showed the clerk I was told sorry, but local only and there was nothing he could do. Unbelievable and I was so mad I just had to leave.  I do not recommend this company at all.</review>

<review>I rent cars in San Diego often and so wanted to make sure this was a company located at the rental center. From the description it looked like it was. BUT on arriving, it was offsite. We tried to call the number but no answer and mailbox full. Finally took an Uber to the site and then found out there was a shuttle but again, not at all clear. Then I could not use a debit card, so after all that, back to the rental center to start all over. The customer service agent was nice but a very frustrating experience. If they would have been more clear about where they are and what payment they take, this would have saved two hours. AND they only hold a reservation for 2 hours, and told me I was out of the timeframe. I was not according to my confirmation email.<//review><userid>100545767078842744077</userid><username>Susan Saetre<//username>< resp>

<text>If I can give half a star I would. I  reserved A compact car through a third-party vendor. When I arrived they had no compact cars she had or wanted to upgrade me to an SUV which would’ve been an additional $200 not even willing to give me a discount because they didn’t have the car on the lot. She was crass, ill mannered, and rude.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>SCAM!!!!!  They deserve NO stars. I rented the car through Alaska Airlines app. I was going to be flying into San Diego and then driving to Arizona to visit my parents for a couple weeks and returning to drop off the car. When we arrived at the airport we had to take two shuttles to get to the car rental place. Once there they asked me where I was spending my two weeks. I told them Yuma. At that point they told me they couldn’t rent a car to me because they don’t allow their cars across state lines!  He also told me they are a small company and if I did take the car across the state border I would be penalized when I brought it back. It is only allowed to go as far as Los Angeles.  I was flabbergasted. NO where on the confirmation or during the rental process was there any Information detailing that. So here I am miles away with my disabled son, dog and husband and no way to get to my parent’s home. They advised us to walk up the street to enterprise and see if they had a car. I did and they didn’t. So we had to take to two shuttles back to the airports on site rental car center. After lugging our luggage around from place to place we finally found an agency that had one available. We had to pay $120 for a one day rental verses the $190 for two weeks. While on the road I called alaska airlines and told them what happened. They brought up the contract and I was told we COULD “travel to California, Arizona and Nevada but not Mexico”!! They lied to us!!!!!  I tried calling back to ace for hours and could never get a live person. The negative impact this has on vacation is immeasurable!  Hours and hours lost. Not having a car the whole time on vacation because we could only afford one day.  On and on. PLUS I DIDN'T GET A REFUND THEY STILL CHARGED MY CC. I think we should be compensated beyond what we paid!  Never will I rent through them and I’ve filed a grievance with alaska airlines to remove them from their partners. I will be filing with the Better Business Bureau!

Lastly, the responses ACE gives all these people are disgusting!  ACE don’t respond unless you want to make it right. It’s downright condescending!

Edited to add to their response!  You do not strive. 2.7 stars with a constant theme of promising services or cars and not following through. It is typical bate and switch. Message me if you truly want to make this right. It’s a scam otherwise.</Review>< pics>

I was overcharged. When talking to the agent, they did not help. Was told I would need to come in cancel the contract and sign up for another with no guarantees of the same price. It was not great service. The charge was almost double what was quoted.< /text>

Rented a car online and was sent the confirmation email with phone number and address of ACE rental. Arrived and was told our was the wrong location however "Don't worry. We'll just switch your reservation to our location". Great. Asked why I was given the wrong address and phone number and he just shrugged and said "Yea, It does that". Then he asked if we wanted the insurance but we declined. Then proceed to tell me it was included in the rental. Weird, so I questioned the price.  It's now $50 MORE than that what my confirmation was!! When I asked about that they told me it's because I'm at a different location. Or the insurance... but never the same answer twice!

Andrew the ONLY receptionist on duty stated that he needed to use the bathroom, but couldn't because there was no one to relieved him, and there was over 15 customers in line.if you are LOCAL renter there is a $500 deposit, LIMITED miles, and you CANNOT leave the county. Also, you can go to MEXICO with Ins., but you are not allowed to go out off state. So MEXICO is safer the OTHER STATES. This company is a JOKE....</text>< rate>

If I could give less stars I would. The lady at the counter was incredibly rude and I got charged more than the confirmation email said and she would not even look into the issue. Also, they did not have the car size that I actually reserved and had to accept a smaller car for more money because they were out of completely everything. I will never rent from here again. When it says they are located at the San Diego airport, they are not. You have to take 2 shuttles to get there. Very misleading.< /review>

We were charged for coverage even after coverage declined.  Our car smelled like smoke and we are non smokers so that got to us.

On the bright side the car was nice if it wasn't for the smell.  The driver on our way back was very kind, one of the highlights of this rental nightmare.

I suggest sticking with the rentals at the actual airport rentals.  This was off site so you have to go to the airport shuttle site then wait to catch another shuttle to this location... it's just to much...</Text><Response>{'time': 1602854846863, 'text': 'We apologize for your  experience and thank you letting us know about this issue, Rejina.

<Text>My experience with Ace rental was terrible. The car I was supposed to rent was supposed to be a Volvo but when I got there they told me that the only thing they had was a Kia Forte. When I got in the car and started driving it was a terrible smell coming from the seats or Mats in the car. It had a strong order of mold and mildew. The whole entire car smelled, even the trunk. Im not sure it the cleaned the car with mildew water or they didn't clean it at all. The smell was just unbearable to inhale when driving with the air on. I tried to call the rental place to let them know but I kept getting their voice-mail. I called at least 6 times with no answer and a full inbox and I couldn't leave a message. I was staying in a hotel an hour away and didn't want to go back to return the car unless I knew I was going to receive another one before I left, but I couldn't get anyone to answer the phone. I want a full refund from this rental and look forward to someone calling me soon to resolve this issue.</Text>< userid>

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! We were on our honeymoon and arrived to pick up the car we had reserved almost 3 weeks before. We were told they didn’t have the car we reserved and our only option was to rent a much larger car, which we would have to pay extra for.... Come on guys! If you don’t have the car you promised you’d have, At least upgrade us at no cost! Carmen at the counter in San Diego was surly and just said, “No, we don’t have your car, we rented them all” No I’m sorry or anything - SAVE YOURSELVES and never do business with these people-<//review>

These folks are friendly and they really hustle.  I’ll rent from them again.
If you’re wondering about the off-off site part of the equation, it does add about 10 minutes on each side, but  it was worth it in my opinion; others on the shuttle next to me had same experience.< /text>

The customer service was fantastic.  They were concerned about our experience on the area and went out of their way to make it better by sharing information on places to go and things to do. That was AWESOME. What wasn’t awesome was that the vehicle we were planning to get wasn’t available and we ended up with a huge vehicle that doesn’t fit in the parking structure and has made it difficult to find parking on our excursions.  The vehicle had warning lights and “the door is ajar” messages going off when it appeared nothing was wrong. We didn’t plan for something this large. Overall it is a great customer service experience but the rental itself left me feeling less than pleased.</Text>

Great company. Easiest pickup and drop off I have ever experienced. Pickup took about 25 minutes including standing in line. Drip off was less than 5 mins.They aren't pushy if you don't want to buy their insurance or do upgrades. Everyone there from front desk, to shuttle service to drop off staff were helpful, friendly and kind. Loved working with them.<//text>

Everything went very smoothly.   We're we're picked up within a few minutes and taken a short distance to their location.   They were very pleasant.   We're got the car and off we went.   I would definitely rent from them again.</Text>

<text>Absolutely worst experience anyone could possibly imagine concerning a rental car....complete nightmare.  Calling itself Mex Rent A Car in San Diego, they worked super hard on trying to steal money from me at every turn!!  I returned a 10 day rental after two days of fighting with them over several under-handed schemes they designed to make fraudulent charges to my debit card.  They have been reported to my bank for fraud investigation.  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT GO NEAR THIS PLACE!!!!!....EXTREMELY SWARTHY CHARACTERS WHILE SMILING AT YOU ARE ROBBING YOU!!</text>< pictures>

<time>1582131502746<//time><Rating>1<//Rating><review>I made a car reservation over a week before my trip. On the day of my trip I called to make sure they had the car I needed. Apparently, the company would not rent to locals due to being close to the Tijuana border and many thefts were occurring. They were extremely rude to me over the phone and hung up in my face when I asked for more information as to what was going on. Not only was this inconvenient since they did not notify ahead of time, but I had to find a rental at the very last minute. Thanks to Hertz, I was able to get what I needed with no hassle and the customer service was 100% better than this company. Never again will I use ace rent a car or refer friends to them.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Get there early... if more than one of you, one should beat feet over there to get in line... best price on Expedia means longer wait.   But ours was a 30-day rental, so worth it.  Andy was a total professional... kept it light and was very apologetic for the line.  Best deal around, just gotta deal with a little bit of a wait to get the car.< /review>

< Review>
I read all of the reviews about this car rental company. Maybe they read them too and they wanted to really help improve the car rental experience with them. I had no problems with this company. The car was clean the gas was full and they took care of us as quickly as they could picking the car up and dropping it off. My only suggestion is that they give people specific directions on how to catch their shuttle bus directly to their off-site location in San Diego. There is an airport shuttle bus that takes passengers to their car rental building at the airport but then we had to wait the ACE shuttle bus to take us to the off-site location. A little time-consuming but we made it it was okay.</Review>

<Text>Would give 0 stars if possible. We ended up using a different company on site the day we needed the rental. The rental location for ACE is off-site NOT at the airport and the “shuttle” number doesn’t work; tried to contact them multiple times and ultimately we were left stranded without any communication from them AND without a rental vehicle we had planned on. Left several messages and never heard back. We ended up using Alamo, for almost the same price with a respectable company. Would highly advise you do not use this company, waste of time and waste of money.</Text>< Response>

<username>Shareka Johnson</username><Text>The staff was extremely RUDE! We flew in from a long trip with small kids. First we had to wait at the rental car terminal for almost an hour. I called several times asking about how we would be picked up and they never sent a van. The last time I called the agent said that we were supposed to call and request a van to pick us up. I called 3 times before and never once did anyone tell me that. Then when they did come pick us up the driver was SO rude! He opened the van for us to put our bags in and then got back in the van. He did not help load all of our bags. He didn't help us with our luggage nor did he even close the door for us once we were loaded. When we arrived he literally parked the van and walked away leaving us to get everything...he didn't even open the door for us! I have never experienced such poor customer service. We will not rent with ACE again. I would rather pay more money and have a great experience! DO NOT RENT FROM THEM, the lower rate is NOT worth the hassle!< /Text>< UserId.>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>Made a reservation weeks ago. Thought I’d save money, ended up spending a rediculous amount of money. Came to San Diego on Presidents’ Day weekend for a friends wedding. Shuttled to the rental car area to find out they are off site. The directions said to call the number to request a second shuttle, so me and my wife sat for about 1 hour calling and calling but no one would pick up. So I had to rent a car last minute with enterprise on a holiday weekend and it cost me $130 per day plus tax... GARBAGE company and customer service. If you “want to make it right”, please pay enterprise the $200 difference I had to pay.

Don’t waste your time or money, book with a real company that will be there for your reservation.< /review>< Response>

I paid in advance for two days rental through ACE in San Diego Airport, Mex  was supposed to pick me up and deliver the car.  When I arrived at the Airport Rental car, after waiting for 30 minutes,  Mex rental car sent an unmarked car with a lady,  tattooed all over and in sweeping suit driver, along a guy to puck me up and took me to their place at 1002  W. Juniper St.  Mex rental told me they wouldn't rent me the car booked and paid in advance.  They did not give any reason.  I asked to credit back my money and take me back to the Airport car rental center so that I make an other rental car.  They refused to do either one.  After 30 minutes begging,  Mex rental would not take me back or pay back my money and threatening I called the Police.  Due to Covid-19 Police was more involved in rather serious matters.  I called Lyft and paid to take me to the Airport rental car center.  AVOID CHEAP CAR RENTAL BY ACE,  Mex , at any cost.  Mex ends up much more costly at the end.    AVOID AND DO NOT BE FOOLED.<//Text>

Paid for a car in advance for the weekend, unlimited miles. I've done this for years with numerous companies. Arrived to pick up the car. The guy behind the counter asked me where I was going to take the car, I said within the state. He then says there's a 150 miles milage limit on the car per for the whole 3 days. Tells me to go to hertz. First time experience.

I call the company number, they tell me it's unlimited and to show the email to the guy. He then becomes rude, says emails are worthless, they have the right to refuse service, says he won't rent a car to me, that they don't have cars for people like me, normal hater nonsense. Welcome to the 21st century ACE.

I call the company and ask for a refund, they tell me they want proof that it wasn't me cancelling the car. I go back in and ask for printout, the guy behind the counter just continues with his hate speech, I record a bit of it, but honestly, it's just incoherent blatter. I ask for a refund, he says email them. I decided to contact my credit card company and dispute the charge. Took 1 minute for them to reverse it. ACE sucks, shouldn't be in business in the modern era.<//Text>

It was just an average car rental. The service leaves a lot to be desired. I was given wrong information about the shuttle from San Diego, tried calling their shuttle phone number and couldn't get anyone to answer. Called their customer service to figure out where I needed to be and I kept being put on hold. Talked to three different people but they just kept putting me back on hold. Finally, another passenger overhead me complaining and helped me get to the right place. The car was fine. Nothing special.<//text>

Had a poor experience here. Waited in line with several small children and suitcases for an hour, only to find out that they did not have the 12 passenger van we reserved available.

The attendant called another lot but got no answer, and offered us two compact rentals as a substitute. I requested two mid size SUVs (to fit our large party and luggage), but was denied.

We cancelled the reservation and found another company that had no wait at the counter and could rent the van.

Extremely disappointed in the service, especially given the wait time and that the company admitted they knew they did not have the van earlier in the day but did not contact us.<//Review>

<text>If I could provide zero stars, I would.
First the car rental is not in the airport - so you have to take a shuttle to the airport car rental area and then call them to get another shuttle to their offsite location. Once I got there, I was told that I had no car since I arrived two hours after my reservation time and he seemed least interested in helping. When I asked if I could get a new reservation, I was told he only had a few cars and they were booked. I ended up having to go back to the airport car rental and renting a car from there.</text><pics>None<//pics>< user_id>

I would give 0 stars if I could. First we were unaware of the fact that after taking a shuttle to the central rental car facility at San Diego airport we would need to wait for another shuttle for off site rental car facilities. It was cold and raining and uncovered so I called to see if the shuttle was near. After three busy ring calls someone finally answered and said the shuttle just left and was on its way. According to google maps the Ace Rent A Car was 1.8 miles away, a 20 minute walk. Thirty minutes later the shuttle still hadn’t arrived. I called again three times and no answer, only busy tones each time. Our rental was reserved and not paid for yet so we proceeded inside to the wonderful Avis counter and rented a car for a comparable price with quick and courteous service. I called again the Ace and canceled our reservation. There was no questioning why or what could be done to change my mind, only an Okay, goodbye. Worst customer service ever.<//review>

This rental agency is not at the airport, which is fine. I got to the waiting area for the shuttle and it never came. I did a little searching and discovered you need to call for a shuttle. I called and waited about 10 minutes to request a shuttle. Nobody ever answered the phone, so I gave up and went to Alamo where Anthony treated me really well.</text>

I made a reservation for a 1 day rental for pickup at San Diego airport at 4 pm on March 31 2020. I called them at 3.55 pm and asked for a ace shuttle pickup. The representative mentioned that a shuttle was being sent. I waited for 15 minutes, no shuttle came. I called again and they said it was on the way. I waited another 15 minutes, no shuttle came. Finally, I get a message, the office closed at 4 pm and the manager asked me to pick up the car at 7 am on April 1 2020. How ridiculous is this?<//Text>

I told them 3 times I wanted to deny the optional insurance as my credit card covered tbe vehicle.  They added it without telling me and said they were just charging me the deposit.  I was charged for the optional insurance.  Do not trust them and review they do not add extras before signing!< /text>

Fantastic staff ! Friendly and courteous! Very clean car . Immediate pickup at airport. Paperwork check in seamless! And we saved over $150 , verses renting a car directly at the airport. ACE is only a few minutes from the airport. No hassles ! Highly recommend!< /Review>

Customer service is friendly and professional. Location is clean. Although a variety of cars, cars are ragged, typically scratched and dented, and not at maximum safety standards ( dry wipers, need tires balance etc.) And interior cleanliness is embarrassing for a reputable company. Most rental prices are comprable to higher-end rental places. If you're not doing a last-minute rental it is best to go to Hertz,  Avis, or budget</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Name>Steven Villegas<//Name><Time>1566932075632<//Time><rating>1</rating><review>I can't say anything good about this location in San Diego. I had booked my rental in advance with plenty of notice through Expedia, I was suppose to arrive at the car rental to pick up at 10am but since our flight was delayed we didn't get there until 2pm. Since I was late they couldn't hold my reservation, when I asked for another car less expensive they told me I would have to pay full price and didn't want to offer any discounts to down grade. The rep and manager we had was not helpful at all. Needless to say we had to walk about 3 blocks to another rental company with our 3 year old in a place we were not familiar with. Not very many options on vehicles, good prices but you better be on time or else they will get rid of your vehicle rental.</review>< pictures>

Slightly inconvenient as it's off site from the main SD rental car center. I think when I was there, they had one guy running the shuttle and checking out the cars. He was really nice. Luckily it wasn't busy but could see that taking longer at certain times. Desk folks were fine. They open at 7am so any drop-offs for earlier flights are at the park shuttle and ride for an extra $15, lame. The car itself was good, no issues. Smaller operation overall, provides cheaper rental options, which is why I went with them.< /review>

Terrible, staff person named Cynthia! Treated me horrible! Would NOT go there! Mean, not helpful, caused me even more problems. The most heartless,  rude PERSON I have EVER been subjected to. One person can make or break a company. She BROKE theirs! Do not go there to ask for even using their restroom! I would not rent a bicycle from them. I would not drive any of their cars for FREE! All Due to girl named CYNTHIA! Whew! Good riddance! Think shes lacking GOD. she told me she didnt believe in imaginary friends. To each their own. However, that might just be her cold hearted problem. Run as fast as you can for that rental company!</review>

<Text>Worst rental car experience I've ever had! Started our vacation off by leaving us stranded waiting for a shuttle pick up for 30 minutes. Called the office 2 times only to have them tell us they are having issues and someone would be on their way. Waited another 10 minutes before we asked a shuttle driver from another car rental company to give us a ride. When we arrived to the office they were unapologetic. We asked to be compensated the $15 that we ended up paying the shuttle driver from the other company for our ride there and Carmen (the gal that at the front desk) said she couldn't help us and gave us a number of someone that we could call which by the way was an invalid number! Do your research and look at all of the reviews!! This place is just as bad as everyone says!!</Text>< time>

<text>Worst rental experience ever. The rental facility was located at a different site than all the other car companies, so you have to call them for a shuttle ride.
I made 4 calls in total, 2 of which nobody picked up at all, and the other two, I spoke with someone and told them I needed a pickup from the terminal. I was put on hold both times and never responded to.
Horrible customer service.
I ended up having to rent a car from another place after waiting an hour for ACE only to realize they weren’t coming.</text>< date>

Don't rent here, shady practices! I am upset that the company did not offer me a way to pay the tolls for driving on the freeway in California and instead turned my information over to a 3rd party collection agency that is threatening me and trying to make me pay an outrageous fee (>$200). I am not from the area and did not understand how the tolls work.  Also, it was not clearly explained to me that I was purchasing additional insurance when I was renting the car. They asked if I just wanted the "basic" rental which I thought meant no additional insurance which was unnecessary because I was already covered. This is no way to treat a customer.</text>

Horrendous experience! Took forever to get a car, our car was beaten up and didn't even have a cover on the GPS antenna unit! Customer service was a nightmare, it was very slow and tedious. Everything was still done on pen and paper. Seem like all they had were hyundais and kias. And was located in what seemed to be an impound lot.< /review>

<Review>The email confirmation stated that Ineeded to go to information counter at airpoet car rental site.  At the airport there was no such place.  The shuttle took us to air port ground trsnsportation car rental where many othercompanies were.  Only one sign finally directed me to walk farther to find a shuttlesite to of site car rental.
I was tired and frustrated.  It was not pleasant getting the paperwork done.  Then salesman said go to row 4 oitside the car was there.  There was no car in #4.  He frustrated withme and came to the door looked, said they moved it and he beeped the car.  He told me that was it.
The car did not have auto lights and the night was confusing with lights.  I drove a few blocks without lights on.
I just would not put another through that at the end of a long day flying.< /Review>< Resp>

<text>I arrived at 7 pm at San Diego airport , called the office 8 times , they never pick up the phone then they picked up after number 9th ! One of the few company that they aren’t in the car rental center !!!! So they have to come pick you up !! Long story short ! They didn’t have the car that I’ve made the reservation for!!!! They are trying to give me a car which is way smaller for the same price !!!
I felt like whoever picked up the phone trying to do the best but the company doesn’t help him to do so !!!
Anyways!! Find another company to rent from !! Do not waste your time!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Terrible.  Very far from the airport rental terminal with no signs to find them.   Have to wait for a second shuttle.   When we finally arrived they didn’t have any suv’s Left even though that’s what we had reserved months before.   Only gave me a price discount after I heard them offering it to the woman next to me.    I would never use them again.</Review>< time>

<text>Reserved an SUV, at ACE. Priceline said that it’s at the San Diego airport, it’s not, it’s in down town. You have to take the airport car shuttle, then need go to another “offsite” car rental waiting area and call for a second shuttle to pick you up. They pick you up in a minivan and drives you off from the airport to downtown SD. It took 20 minutes for the second shuttle to arrive and 10 minutes to get to the car rental location. I got there and asked for the SUV which I reserved, all they had was bunch of KIA minivans. They said that they will upgrade me to minivan. That is not an upgrade. Now I have to get To the airport 2 hours in advance just so I have enough time for two car rental shuttles to get me to the airport. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS.</text><Resp>{'time': 1569353167836, 'text': 'We appreciate you providing your experience and letting us know about this issue, Vitaliy.

This company is not the best to rent from . First of all , I didn’t agree to holding $200 extra dollars on my credit card. That’s not necessary if you are renting with a major credit card . Shouldn’t have to do that on a major credit card. That should be for debit card rentals only . Secondly I requested a Car seat for my 2 year old . They give me the car seat saying that it’s my responsibility to put it in & it’s against their policy to do it . Huh ? So I’m struggling to figure out how to put “their” car seat in the car. The location wasn’t attached to the Sandiego airport . Their shuttle took so long to come I had to Uber myself to the location . The vehicle was basic , their renting is no different from someone with bad credit or prepaid options . Not renting again at all . Ever . Thrifty , Alamo , or Other companies are much better.</text>

Went to pick up the vehicle; it was offsite. Took 45 minutes to get the driver. When we got there, they said because we were late, they released our car. They only had 2 vehicles; both of which were upgrades; I could have the upgrade for twice the price!!! Bait and switch!!!  Looked like a shady operation. We left and rented from Payless. Would never use them.<//review>

<text>The worst rental car experience ever.  I reserved a 7 passenger mini van and when I arrived the surly and indifferent ACE Rep informed me that all they had was a compact car that was supposed to accommodate my 7 passengers.  She then informed that I got what I deserved because I booked through a third party - Priceline.  This car rental company has no integrity and cannot be trusted.  Simply terrible!<//text><time>1552320920618</time>< user_id>

The clerk was on his phone doing something 1 foot far from me and didn't notice a customer was in front of him until I ask for service, then I asked for a car and he said there is no cars without reservation. Great and "SMART SERVICE" for last minute customers. I don't recommend rent at Otay Pacifica Location, they don't care you as customer.< /review>

Yikes, I’m shocked this place sent me a survey. I was in line at the San Diego off site counter at Ace/Mex when they announced they were all out of cars. Everyone in line had reservations through Hotwire, Priceline, etc but Ace overbooked themselves so I had to scramble and find another rental car last minute. Cost me twice as much.<//Text>

Car promised was unavailable and attitude was very bad.  Only replacement was a minivan which I did not want. Basically they said too bad that's all we have.<//Text>

Beware. This Ace Rent a Car is 35 minutes from the airport. There is no shuttle. There is no phone number on the online booking receipt. The website does not alert the consumer to this fact. There is another Ace Rent a Car which is close the airport. We arrived at the Ace near the airport and thankfully they were able to serve us.</Review>

ACE rent a car was the worst customer service that I had in my whole life. They didn’t have the car available. The attendant was super rude and if they have the car available they would put 150 miles per day for use only. I don’t recommend for anyone!!!! Do not rent a car for this place never!!! Super disappointed. They ruined all my trip with my family<//Review>

<Review>The San Diego office of Ace rent a car evidently closes at 9 p.m., a fact not mentioned in any information provided by the company or Expedia.  When I arrived at 10:15 pm and tried to pick up my car I discovered this, after spending an hour trying to get the car.  I’m now trying to have the charges refunded, but the process takes several days and no one can say if they will be refunded.  All I can say is avoid ACE unless you enjoy this sort of customer service.<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1571426124937, 'text': 'We are sorry to hear of your unpleasant experience and would like to look further into your complaint but are unable to find a booking under your name.

Arrived before they closed at 9 pm, called, and the person who answered the phone said the shuttle will be there 10-15 minutes.
But no shuttle ever came, me and all other customers end up with no car at that time at the airport.  The worse thing is that most other companies had no available cars to rent at that time,  there are a few cars available, but it's $100+ a day.
I will no recommend this company.<//review>

(Translated by Google) bad experience with this company, they are not good to communicate the charges, the car in poor condition and was not ready, also their accounts do not add up and in the end they overcharge you, nor do they explain the breakdown of the charges correctly.

(Original)
mala experiencia con esta compañia, no son buenos para comunicar los cargos, el auto en mal estado y no estaba listo,  además que sus cuentas no cuadran y al final te cobran de más, ni explican el desgloce de los cargos correctamente.</Review>

< review>
Pho and donuts? Sure, why not! Two of some of my favorite things can be found at South Swell Donuts: Pho and donuts! And it is especially comforting on a rainy day for someone visiting from out of town like myself.

It was a rainy afternoon when I turned to my trusty Yelp app to look for a pho spot in the area. Surprisingly, South Swell Donuts popped up on my feed and I began perusing this shop’s Yelp photos and reviews. I was sold after reading a few reviews and I knew I had to try it out.

South Swell Donuts is located in Laguna Beach on PCH between 2nd and 3rd. There is limited street parking in front of the shop, as well as up the hill from the corner of the street. After snagging a parking spot, I walked in with my mom and we were welcomed with a friendly, “Hello, sweetheart!” This friendly owner was Jackie and she was the sweetest lady!

We asked about their pho but, with our luck and Mother Nature, Jackie told us they had sold out of pho earlier in the day due to popular demand and the rainy weather. No worries at all because we were able to take back some donuts. Jackie recommended we try their Cronut, which we got 2, as well as some twists and Apple fritter. We also picked up some milk to drink with our donuts.

For a family donut shop, their twisted donuts are on the smaller size; however, they tasted unbelievably delicious! There is something about them that tastes a lot milkier or creamier with a fluffier batter. It is definitely not like the hollow raised donuts with just sugar — South Swell Donuts are a step above mom-and-pop donut shop donuts. Their Cronut is definitely a MUST here! It is so dense, crispy yet fluffy and overall just good! Their donuts are not overly sweet like Krispy Kreme but they have that same melt-in-your-mouth consistency. Their donuts are not complex in flavor like Side Car Donuts but are classic in their flavors.

I was really pleased with their donuts and I definitely will stop by again the next time I’m in the area! Jackie’s customer service is enough to make you return for another visit and, hopefully, next time I’ll be able to grab a bowl of their pho (rain or shine)!<//review>

<Text>Ive had my share of donuts throughout my lifetime... Ive had Winchells, Krispy Kreme, fancy gourmet ones, stale 7-11 things, and almost everything in between; NOTHING compares to this place! I wound up in here by accident, only to discover they have THE MOST AMAZING donuts. Dont pass this place up.</Text></record>

My coworker from out of town loves this lady and we have dubbed her the "Pho' Queen." (Close enough, right? :)) Donuts are great here (including the cronut!) as well as the Pho' which you can order at lunch with different meats. Recommend beef or shrimp and then season to taste with the basil, cilantro, lime, sriracha, and bean sauce that comes out with it. Careful not to overdo as she normally doesn't bring out a salt option to rebalance back. I'm sure that can be fixed though. Pho' Queen is from Cambodia (close enough!) and has been been in the area for long time! :)</text>

Not only the best place in Laguna Beach for donuts, the ONLY place in Laguna for donuts. And far and away the best place for cronuts. And I notice that they are going to lengths to make sure that the place is scrupulously clean.</Text>

<Text>Quite the gem for a study spot or tea cafe. Constantly playing quiet lofi with a great atmosphere and outlets are plentiful for your recharging needs. The menu is surprisingly more robust and diverse than you would expect when you first see the place. Service is fast and polite with no complaints from me!< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>It's pretty good. My eyes lit up when I tasted the butter on the waffle because it was exactly that. Real butter. The presentation is also phenomenal. I will say though the cutting board was somewhat a confining eating experience. I'm not really one to draw within the lines so I was stressing neatness a little bit more than I would have liked while I was eating.

But yeah overall I really liked the place. Milk tea was just okay, but honestly the coffee seems to be the way to go. The tea did come out in a giant mug however so that was cool.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3xpCfDOoOXcvCGeT2j7QZtrx-j0ARFbxqfaxE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4hy81JM51ffzBthCTfiaM5c7IadKG51xfdNVo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzFWuN2NgAe55Fp3wv4cS9SjISevpTU4lG5qur=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><time>1580167003184</time></record>

Wanted a warm dessert whilst in the SGV and was not disappointed. The milk boba drinks are generous and the waffles of varying flavors are well worth it. Light, crispy, and flavorful. Highly recommend< /Review>

My favorite location for tasty cafe food. Service is always super even when they have a full house. The prices are well within reason for the quality.</Text>

So after my doctor's appointment we decided to look for something near the area and found the Hide Out, it did take us a minute to find it lol cause it's not in the visible shopping center outside its located inside. It does have a patio where you can sit and eat/drink but be aware that you're stuff will be packed to go.
To snack on we ordered a deep fried platter, which we chose, waffle fries, onion rings, chicken fingers and popcorn chicken. Its actually pretty filling and not bad. What was surprising was the chicken fingers those were actually pretty big, you know some places you actually get nuggets. The popcorn chicken was pretty good had little pieces of garlic, it was a nice touch.
Best part of coming here were the drinks! Who doesn't like a little ice cream with a shot of espresso, I was surprised with the size of the Affogato. But I do believe the best one was the Tiramisu Milk Tea, we will definitely be coming back for more!<//Review>

<UserId.>106074498535064782683</UserId.><Text>The name rings true. This cafe is wonderful. The lattes are great, the food is flavorful, and the milk teas are delicous.

My favorite coffee is the Tiramisu Latte. My girlfriend is especially fond of the Rose Latte. My favorite tea is the Hokkaido Milk Tea.

The menu items offered are a surprise, and are very tasty. The grilled check with rice, and BBQ Pork Belly are amazing. For desert, the Banana Nutella waffle is my favorite.

Highly recommend this place:)</Text><gmapID>0x80c32a583894ae63:0x3ada8a044b178df6< /gmapID><time>1582853516505</time>< name>

It was my first time here today at my friend's recommendation. As some other reviews state, I do think the menu is a bit on the pricey side for everything, except the actual "meals" (noodles, salads, rice dishes, etc), so even though it appears to be most popular for these things, I feel like this isn't the best place to go for a quick snack or drinks if you're concerned about prices.  I only ordered the dry noodles, and they were very delicious. The portion size is a bit on the small side, though it was filling for me, so I would definitely say that this is the place to go for small meals. If you're really hungry and looking for big portions for a low price, this is not the place for you. The male server my friend and I interacted with was extremely nice and accommodating 😊 I would consider coming here again for a small meal or to split some appetizers/desserts with friends, and this place definitely lives up to its name since it's quite "hidden away" in the back of the plaza! 😂<//text>

<review>I come here a lot when I hang with my friend. He loves coming here and so usually no matter what happens, we find ourselves here.

I like the atmosphere here tho, it doesn't feel like your normal Rowland Heights cafe. Feels more like a city spot. Got great coffee and teas, when you sit in there and chill it feels like a cozy den.

Some people study here, but to me it is a much better place to sit and chill. Has much more of a bar/pub feel than a cafe.< /review>< Pics>

I come here quite often, almost once a week.
The drinks here are pretty good and not too badly priced.

It is a very nice and chill hangout place to meet up with friends for tea or to eat snacks.

I love their hashtag fries so good!<//Review>

<Review>Okay drinks. I got the mango milk tea with boba and the milk tea was pretty tasty (standard syrupy mango flavor with creamy milk tea) but the boba was a little too sticky and soft. It was sticking to my teeth. Their other milk teas are also amazing. They have a more handcrafted type taste than boba shops. I think they use real milk. It's expensive here though, so I'd only come every once in a while. Great environment though. They have interesting designs and some vintage cameras out as decoration. The employees are very nice and accommodating. They fixed my orders without hesitation and are super polite.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Finally tried this cute tea spot that serves a handful of drinks, appetizers and some dishes . Enjoyed the drink I had and most of all the appetizers we ordered . The pop corn chicken may have been one of the best I have tried, maybe for the fact they have fried garlic in it . The cheesy tator tots was pretty good as well. Can't wait to try the other food and drinks they offer . Service was great no complaints on that end. This plaza does have plenty of free parking, but Folks please park your cars within the lines for parking spaces .</Review>

I originally came here to try their seaweed drink and ended up not appreciating as much as i did in the past. I ended up really loving the the churro ice cream we ordered. The presentation looked very mediocre but the taste was unstoppable. I loved it so much I ate the whole thing within seconds and wanted more!<//Review>

<Text>A cute little cafe in the heart of an up and coming plaza, offers a different style of drink from your traditional tea shops. They focus here on both coffee and tea, and our really trying to make a name as the go to spot for hipster-like behavior in the area. Can be crowded at times and quality of drinks fluctuates from barista to barista. Great place to meet and greet for the coffee meets bagel crowd, except no bagels here.</Text>< pictures>

I love their lattes! My favorite is their hazelnut and for milk tea I suggest the tiramisu! Their waffle with banana and Nutella is scrumptious! It isn't a whole waffle but it's bite size tear drop shaped put together to make one waffle I believe it comes in a total of 8 or 9 pieces with Nutella, banana chocolate sauce and whip cream on top. Popcorn chicken is also good lightly seasoned so it isn't to garlicky or salty.

Ambience of the place has a vintage motif to it. Makes you feel warm and cozy being that it's medium to small coffee shop. The great aroma of coffee beans and snacks welcomes you in. Service is good, they'll make suggestions based on what you are looking to try, food comes out in a timely manner. Would definitely return!< /text>

Quality drinks and food, cute and knowledgeable staff, great atmosphere. Coffee roasts are just a tad dark, but still very drinkable.< /Text>

<Text>Cute, little, hidden spot in Rowland! I was lucky enough to come on an off night! There was ample amount of parking spots. My friend has tried to come here before but, there was never parking. Luckily, she went with me this time, huh?! :P

What I Ordered
- Gummy Bear By Andy
- Churro Ice Cream

Custard filled Churro with Ice Cream!!! I wished I ordered one just for myself instead of sharing! Gummy Bear By Andy was a let down. It didn't wow me as much as the name did. It was refreshing but, nothing I couldn't get better at Tastea. I will be back to try other food items on the menu! The #Hashtag Waffle Fries look delicious!<//Text>< Time>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>Cool space for coffee. A/C, free wi-fi, fruity tea drinks - perfect for hot Summer days.

I've been coming to Hide Out for a while, to "work" (let's go, funemployment!). I keep coming back because the staff are awesome and the drinks are delicious and well presented (see pictures of the Tiramisu milk tea, par example). The big draw for me has been the coffee (Temple Coffee, last I checked), but there's enough variety to keep everyone happy (tea drinks, fruity tea fusions, cakes, pastries, french fries, ramen, etc). I haven't found any go-to food items yet, but the Hokkaido milk tea w/ an espresso shot and slice of green tea cake have been my usuals. I live large.

I'm probably scratching just the surface on the food and drinks only because I'm usually on my lappy, ahem, "working". The atmosphere is pleasant, crowd is your usual Rowland Heights type, with thinning number of younger kids now that school's back. Decor is, well, like if somebody had a Pinterest board of aged wood furniture, white spaces, small green house plants, and trendy yet ironic furnishings (looking at you typewriter on that strangely positioned bar area!). But! the baristas, seriously. No pretentious airs at all, just cool people who will help ya figure out what you'd like.< /Text>< pictures>

3.5 but I'm rounding up b/c of good service. I came here on a Sunday afternoon around 2pm and a table by the window was available. I came here to work on a project with someone and the atmosphere was so accommodating.

I put in an order of macrons (earl grey, rose, salted caramel, lavender, and green tea) All were tasty and not too sweet. My only comment would be that I saw the staff member taking the per-packaged macrons out of the freezer, came in a pack of 12 per flavor. Even though still flavorful, tasty, and not too sweet, I secretly hoped that they were freshly made.

I also ordered my usual milk tea, no ice, and less sweet. My items were brought to my table. The milk tea was yummy as in not watered-down and the right amount of sweetness.

Later #waffle cut fries were ordered. My goodness, the portion was HUGE! My project buddy and I couldn't finish. This kind of reminded me of chili cheese fries except with an egg on top, interesting touch. The ingredients weren't too greasy, but I probably couldn't eat this often for my health's sake.

Overall, we occupied this space for over 4 hours and no one hurried us out. In fact, the staff came by a few times to see if we needed anything else.

I'd come here again, but probably not before trying out another place. It was a bit difficult to have a conversation because of sound bouncing in all different directions as well as the blenders running behind the cash register.<//Text>

<Name>Jonathan Kong< /Name><text>Love the pizzas and the staff member I spoke with was great; but for patron awareness I have to share my recent experience.

I came in for a heart shaped pepperoni pizza with a gift card, but the staff member as friendly as he was, was unable to charge the gc- he even admitted he hadn't seen one before lol. So try as he might he couldn't utilize it...so I ended up paying cash, normally not a big deal, but wanted everyone (and even the owners) to be aware that's there's either some training issues or something that needs to be addressed!< /text><userid>103034549821459532424<//userid></record>

My family loves Mountain Mike's "The Everest" pizza. We order it frequently and it never disappoints. It's a classic combination of pepperoni, Italian sausage, salami, linguica, beef, mushrooms, black olives, bell peppers and onion in a classic red sauce. It's definitely one of our absolute favorite pizzas.</Text>

I eat in this lovely spot quite often! This is the best place to pass a nice evening.  I visit this spot regularly. The cooking is just great, the staff members are courteous and the rates are affordable. I like going in this restaurant over a rich dinner.< /Text>

Great classic pizzas. Be sure to use the online coupons when you order - you can get a large for less the price of a medium. The thin crust on the Pike's Peak is a great combination - especially if you give the crust to your pup!</text>

This is a busy place. Salad bar was clean and the pizza was great. Staff friendly and helpful. Only issue is the toilet needed paper and mopping. Really important when you got a lot of kids in the place.</text>

<rate>4< /rate><Review>We had a great time. The place is very big so you can easily find your own space with plenty of room. There is a cool arcade and the kids had lots of fun running around but did not bother any other guests! The pizza was very good (we had their veggie and a cheese and pineapple) as well as the garlic sticks (with and without cheese) and there is a decent selection of beers (though a couple more options would have been nice) with chilled glasses (nice touch that you don't see as often as you should). The staff was very helpful and nice. I'll definitely come again soon.< /Review>< Pictures>

On tues, March 31st I called at 3:55pm to order be phone a pizza delivered and left at my door after knocking to avoid any personal contact. I live 2 miles away and despite my directions after a knock on the door I was told that I had to sign a receipt and did I wabt to add a tip. I had orderered and told the phone order taker that there would be no tip and was told the bill would be 27 dollars. I signed the dareceipt but was not left a copy. I do no appreciate the exposure at this time and the lack of response to my directions. Shoyld hire better people to represent you. Thanks.< /Review>< name>

Have you ever wanted to.eat delicious pizza while watching 3 professional sports, simultaneously? On those rare occasions when they're all having timeouts at once, you can fill the entertainment gap by playing video games at the arcade. It's a good place for adults and kids. They do birthday parties.  They have free WiFi.</review>

Love the pizza. Best in town. The bummer is when the tv's are showing basketball, baseball and golf. What? It's hockey season. Where is the Sharks game? I was told they don't get that channel.
Really? Or is it that they don't know how to use their tv system? ....or didn't want to be bothered. ::sigh::
I cancelled my order and went to Murphy St to watch the game.< /Text>

Probably one of my favorite pizza spots- I'm very picky about my pizza, so that says a lot. Super creamy, cheesy, and delicious. The pepperoni is extremely crispy and amazing. Only downside is that it's on the pricey side, but certainly worth it.<//text>

<text>I ate here yesterday for the lunch buffet. The staff seemed really friendly. But I'm pretty sure that their Buffet gave me food poisoning. A few hours after I ate there I started feeling nausea and couldn't stop vomiting the entire night. I am a pretty healthy person and very rarely get sick, I don't even remember the last time I vomited. Needless to say I would not want this to happen to anyone of you guys!!!!!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Take out was very prompt, and the pizza was OK. It looks like they pre-bake their crusts.  Given that, it probably shouldn’t be as pricey as it is. Serviceable pizza, nothing special.</Review>

Had an end-of-the-seasoj little League get together here.  There pizza was decent and the staff somewhat attentive and we were able to use a back room.  The games in the back barely worked however and they placer IST not well lit.< /review>

Did a really nice job of pizza without cheese and a great covering of veggies.  Nicely setup for groups.  Beer for the grown-ups and arcade machines for the kids.< /Review>

Decent pizza, but I can't recommend the cheesy bread sticks.

The prices are good enough that we'll certainly order from them again.</Review>

I love this spot! They provide awesome food, their menu is rich, The chief cook in that place is well trained, I like very much tasting all their dishes. The food is always fresh, the service towards the guests  is good. I  go often to this place and I was never discontended. I recommend this place.<//Text>

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>Food was pretty good. Quick takeout service. Nice staff. Had the chicken marsala and a pepperoni pizza. Pizza was really good but very greasy, chicken was kind of saltly, and I am a salt-a-holic, so for me to say that, that's saying something.  Otherwise still pretty darn good< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>By far the best tasting AND most affordable Italian restaurant I've had nearby! The prices were all very affordable, and the selection of pasta is vast. I ordered the Pasta Special and it was perfect. It had a ton of chicken and artichoke. The tiramisu was excellent as well, it was full of flavor.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Last week was the first time we visited this place. But It is definitely not the last time. We had great time with the courteous service, with the finest  cuisine and booze and with the comfortable charge. We will definitely visit there in a short time.</Text>

They lost 2 packages i was suppose to recieve worth nearly $300. After 8 visits to here and over 3 hours wasted, I found out on my own they delivered both to the wrong address. After speaking to the very rude supervisor, he said they'll send the driver to "investigate." The other employee already told me this before and nothing was done. After responding to the case numbers by email, and all of the in person visits, I suspect they were intentionally stalling so that I couldn't make the deadline to file a report within the 30 day limit. (I should've just filed it from the beginning, hindsight) I've had several encounters with different employees here. A few were very polite, and a couple were very rude. As a whole the customer service is terrible.< /Text>

I have coming here for over 15 years. This post office always has very good service. The lines are handled professional & expeditiously. My PO Box is here and I sometimes have a long drive to get my mail but I don't mind. I wouldn't change it. The building is clean and safe unlike some other post offices with ugly exteriors.</Review>

Lost certified mail. Isn’t that supposed to be the thing you are  good with? That’s why it’s certified. Delivery from San Diego to Chula Vista...... And had a letter cut open and delivered then 2 months later.</text>

They get a pension and great benefits and you would think they would be happy with what most Americans don’t even have. This place needs a HUGE shakedown on customer service training.

I can see why FedEx, UPS, DHL, EVEN AMAZON, have been picking up the slack. Such an awful department.</Text>< Pics>

<text>This is by far the most USELESS post office I’ve ever had to use! The postal clerks are rude and extremely slow. For whatever reason, I cannot receive packages to my door because I live on a 3rd floor apartment. Because I am an essential medical worker  and work regular business hours, I
I’ve  spent my whole lunch 1 hr break at this establishment more than once. Don’t bother calling either because the phone just rings and rings! If the postal contracts in the ever-growing Eastlake/Otay Ranch areas include not delivering packages to 3rd floor apartments, then perhaps this post office should be staffed and prepared to handle the post office traffic, because this is just not acceptable< /text><user_id>113694759930676038612</user_id>< Rating>

Don’t come here. Staff is rude and lazy. There’s always a long line too and no parking. Mexican lady working there is really rude and has attitude issues. I tried sending something and bought an envelope there that was clearly labeled at 49 cents, and she said that it costs more.<//text>

If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I had been coming here for years, and for some time, they were consistent and relatively professional in dealing with mail on hold, delivery complications, etc. However, this is no longer the case as of this year. Despite my mother physically going to this location to declare our house as NOT vacant, and having previously (and recently) spoke with their manager, this USPS is still marking our house as vacant--and leaving a slip in our box to deter other carriers from leaving packages in our box. It is beyond frustrating, and almost seems deliberately done due to prior efforts made, on our part, to clarify this misunderstanding. We do our best to collect our mail at least weekly, but every member of my household is also working and/or in college--some of us with two jobs. It is just a shame that this USPS is no longer willing to accommodate hard-working families and their needs.</Text>

As much as I dislike this post office I had to go to drop off a package.  It was 10:30am on a Friday and surely they would be fully staffed, but nope. There was one person working the counter, 20 people or so in line.  If you're coming here, don't be in a hurry and you might want to pack a lunch.</review>

Received notification from Amazon that my package has been delivered and left near the door. Not even close. It was left on the pathway IN THE RAIN. 2 more measly feet and it would have been on my front porch, out of the rain, where it is dry. Seriously.
Well done USPS employee delivering in the 91913 area on 2/27/17 around noon.</text>

<text>To the discriminating Filipino lady who thinks I don’t understand Tagalog: You’re a disgrace that shouldn’t be working at a post office. Today 5/20/19 I came in to find a parcel that has been lost for two months now. And when she was explaining how she couldn’t help me find it even if I knew my address and the address I was sending it to. She said that the only way would be if I had a tracking number. It’s been over two months, what if I can’t find it? So I said, “This is BS.” Using the actual word for BS. And I guess she took that to offense because when I came in with the tracking number she was telling another customer to not lose their tracking number, in a mocking tone while making eye contact with me! As if that wasn’t enough, the next customer she was helping was Filipino and she started to talk about me in Tagalog! “This girl is so rude. She said BS to me. Bwisit ka, talaga?” Which translates to “BS you, right?” CAN YOU IMAGINE!? I’m so disgusted by this lady. Can you imagine what she says about customers in Tagalog, assuming they don’t understand, not only ruining the reputation of Filipinos out there but for this branch. Honestly, I think she deserves to be disciplined. It’s beyond rude. You wouldn’t be so rude if everyone could understand you.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80d9456a29bf28cb:0x4fe2b519222cfd31<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is sad because this week we received an opened Christmas card and found out that a gift card was supposed to be in there. Good thing we still have the card, this made me  think this is the same taker from last year when my Aunt sent my daughter a birthday card with 50 dollar bill. We never got t he card.  Why? :(</review>

Post office is great, no complaint there.  The reason for three stars is because they lost my passport.   Marked delivered but not in my mailbox.  State department had to Use UPS to make sure I got it.  I also have been getting my neighbor's mail in my mailbox every so often.< /Review>

<text>Laziest humans on the planet. Don't ever expect a delivery to show up if it is on the weekend. The past 5 times they claimed "undeliverable as addressed" rather than do their job. I also witnessed the lady that does the deliveries throw a package of mine the last few feet to the door. Just awful people.</text>< Pics>

Zero stars really. I ordered a packaging back in February... FEBRUARY.  And it arrived, October 12th in the afternoon. I checked it when i got home today and i was expecting the package to be in the bigger mailbox. No they shoved my package in the regular mailbox slot, scrapping and damaging it. It was supposed to be brand new and after waiting all this time some idiot shoves it into the mail card slot forcing the package in there and ruining what i have been waiting for to arrive for 8 months. Im super pissed off and the best part is of course calling does not help either, i’ve been on hold for 30+ mins at this point (46:42mins) and nothing. Worst service ever, I think the DMV people actually help you out more than this. Never had a problem there.<//Review>

They have been my Vet for more than 15 years. Always have been great. You are welcomed with smiles and they know your pet by name. Always so friendly and accommodating. They love your pets as much as you.</text>

My family has been taking our pets here for almost 30 years & even though our favorite veterinarian is retiring, I already like the new vet just as much. I always tell all my friends to take their pets here because the whole staff are the most honest and caring people I've come in contact with.<//Review>

<Text>Dr. T and his team are simply amazing, and there is no other vet in town like them. They made my Pepperanne feel like she is apart of their family, and that's something that is extremely important to me.  They have always worked in the best interest for my Pep with prices that can't be beat.
Love you guys,

<Text>I feel as if I have a second family here at the Downey Veterinarian Hospital. I haven't been there now for almost a year actually it's been a year plus but I will not return until I can see the doctor and bring my dog in.

This Veterinary Hospital super friendly and very helpful.  I would definitely keep taking my furry babies.  The Vet always takes the time to call and explain what is wrong and offer advice that what will be better for my furry babies.< /review>

Downey Vet's office took the time to listen and understand that my Yorkie had a really bad experience at another Vet's and was very frightened. They were "The Best", she was returned to me VERY happy and not bruised up. Thank you Downey Vet. I will never take my 4-legged little girl anywhere else ever!!!!<//text>

In these times of Covid they have made it pleasant for both our pet and us. I think and enjoy this new normal as they conduct the needs of our pet all while we're in our vehicle. The process of our visit while maintaining present day protocols are admirable. Thank you for being our Vet.< /Text>

As for ME, the ONLY place I would ever take my fur babies is Downey Vet Hospital. They’re professional, friendly, caring, and accommodating. I’ve been taking my furry kids there for over 25 years!!! Thank You, DVH for being BEYOND AWESOME all these years ❤️<//review>

<Name>Mark K</Name><userid>101370232608294120127< /userid><Review>NEVER WILL GO BACK! It’s a shame but true. We had been taking our pets to them for years up until the past couple which we noticed things weren’t the same, maybe new management has something to tell with it?!
Tried to get our dog in for routine shots last August was told had to wait 8 weeks for appointment. Instead called Ashton animal hospital and got in 2 days Later with appointment.
THE LAST STRAW! Since mor familiar with them we Set up another appointment with DVH again for regular shots and check up and again 6 week wait. Showed up for our dogs appointment ON TIME that we waited for 6 weeks just to find out that they cancelled our appointment. When I asked why,  they said we never reaffirmed our ALREADY SET UP APPOINTMENT. First said they texted us, except I told her the number is a land line so not possible, she then said sent to email, BS NEVER RECEIVED ONE! and she couldn’t be sure what happened except that my appointment was given to a sick pet TODAY. Im thinking THEY GAVE MY SPOT TO A SICK PET BECAUSE THEY WILL MAKE MORE MONEY IM SURE!!
HOPE IT PAID WELL BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOST OUR BUSINESS FOR EVER.< /Review></record>

Staff was very rude and not nice to customer. Was advised to go to different vet for services. I had been a previous customer and was shocked I was treated so horribly. The owner should be advised the staff is recommending customers to go to different vet for services.  Reading the other reviews, the staff must be selecting who they like and dislike??<//text>

< Review>
Communication is the key to success,  this whole team is very nice, but they all need to be on the same page,  they need a good leader/supervisor to run the show to meet customers expectations, on every visit, it looks like the poor girls are lost, clueless with what is going with my dog, they always seem confused,  probably they overbook appointments to the point it gets out of control< /Review>

Great small veterinarian spot in Downey. Quick service EVEN with COVID-19. Price was reasonable, make sure to ask beforehand what you are signing up for though. Other than that, all good.< /Review>

There is  a reason why this place is still in business! Not only is everyone very professional , but they give a level of care and love to you and your furbabies that is unmatched. I have been coming here for years and years. I come from very far. This team has made all the difference in care for my babies.  Dr T answers all my questions and when I call the girls are very informative. Especially Char, when i talk to her shes very patient and kind. Alondra is amazing. I love seeing her. I love seeing all of them. Stick with the best!!</Review>

Dr. T and his team are simply amazing, and there is no other vet in town like them. They made my Pepperanne feel like she is apart of their family, and that's something that is extremely important to me.  They have always worked in the best interest for my Pep with prices that can't be beat.
Love you guys,

Siobhan RN, BSN</review>

Last week my Teddy’s teeth were fractured by another dog and were hanging out. I called the office and they admitted Teddy right away. They were able to help him and if it wasn’t for the Petcare Plan it would’ve made a big dent in my wallet. Both Petcare plan and The Dr. dr.  were so helpful.  I love going to Downey Vet Hospital.</Text>

I never ever take my time to review any place I visit. But I have to for this one. I’m extremely happy that I decided to bring my boy Archie to you guys when he got sick. You guys helped him so much and also helped me. I would’ve been very heart broken if something would’ve happened to my boy. You guys have been patient, honest, and overall amazing. Thank you!<//Review>

For a city vet they are kind and reasonable. A little expensive,  but they are willing to listen to you and work with your budget. The new Pet Desk app they use is really helpful for all the paperwork/making appointments.</review>

I highly recommend Downey Veterinarian Hospital to take care of your furry loved one.  I have been taking the little love of my life to them for over two years now (which is when I adopted my dog at just 5 weeks old).They are a very professional, skilled, caring, compassionate staff. They offer a wonderful program to help you out with the cost of taking care of your pet and are very good at sending you reminders for vaccinations, flea control, upcoming check ups, etc. I wouldn't take my pet anywhere else! The time that they take and the care that they give makes all the difference! :)<//Text>

<review>Dr. T and his staff are very friendly and very patient. The staff is always polite and efficient. I really enjoy Dr. T as he is always so caring when it comes to my cats.

The entire staff is wonderful there and I can't say enough nice things about them all.<//review>< pics>

I called around to many Vets to find decent prices since I was a first time dog owner. This was the Vet with the best price. And I am so glad I went there. They are great. Dr. T is very patient, helpful and knowledgeable. The assistants and front desk personnel are also very nice and helpful. It has been 3 years and highly recommend them. They even accommodate you when you are a walk in.
Their caring nature became even more evident when my doggie was diagnosed with diabetes. They have been so caring toward her and so patient with all the questions I had. They have assisted me with me friendly attitude and smile whenever I called about a concern. Definitely very happy I stuck with them<//Review>

<review>Staff is very welcoming and make sure to make my pet comfortable. Phone service is horrible they didn’t want to set an appointment, they just wanted me to walk in at that moment. If I’m calling to make an appointment it’s because I can’t go at the moment. Thanks< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Name>

I absolutely without a doubt recommend Downey Veterinary Hospital.  Dr. T is the best vet ever!!!  He is kind, friendly, very knowledgeable and he takes his time.  You never feel like just a number and you walk out of the office with all your questions answered.  His staff is also the BEST!!  All of the them are nice and friendly and ready to help!!!  I definitely recommend Downey Veterinary Hospital!!  I have been taking my two dogs for years and I wouldn't go anywhere else!!!< /review>

Please allow me to share the most horrifying experience with Veterinarian of my life as someone who has worked in a vet office and has a special needs dog who has seen many different vets because of both necessity and travel.

I really wanted to like this practice, it had good reviews and it is in walking distance of where I just moved. I am sure for the average person and pet, this place seems nice and has good prices for vaccines. However, my dog is special needs. He has Immune Mediated Hemolytic Anemia. IMHA dogs are supposed to avoid vaccines, certain antibiotics, and anything that could trigger his immune system. I have worked for a vet office before, and my dog has seen many different vets because we move a lot, so I've heard a lot of professional opinions from actual specialist that coincide the many hours of research I have done
My dog was in need of a dental and setting up a primary care doctor for this new location. I made an appointment for a new patient/dental exam. I call and come in early for my appointment and explain my dog had gotten into cookies a couple hours earlier wondering if he could induce vomiting because I was unsure of how much semi-sweet chocolate he had consumed. Firstly, the vet had a really thick accent and couldn't speak English fluently, so that already made me uneasy since my dog's issues are so serious and there is a massive communication barrier. On top of that, he claimed that it was too late to do so, and didn't seem concerned at all. He then walks out with a Distemper Parvo vaccine and highly insist that he gives my IMHA dog the vaccine, and proceeds to administer it. I am clearly extremely uncomfortable with this and protest saying other vets and his internal medicine specialist are scared to give him vaccinates. He ignores my protest and administers the vaccine. I am then frozen and confused. This is a vet, someone I am supposed to trust with my pet, and yet he is administering an IMHA dog that is potentially poisoned with chocolate a vaccine!?!?!  Once I was able to gather my thoughts, I panic and ask what about a reaction, what about his IMHA!?! that very serious disease that can kill my dog. He then proceeds to tell me "If he has a reaction, it will be within 2 hours." WHAT!?! He isn't going to have an allergic reaction, IF he reacts, he is going to start killing all his red blood cells over the next week or two, throw clots in his body, and die. The treatment would be blood transfusions and months of serious meds if he survives costing me thousands. That vet was disgusting and that was the most horrifying experience with a vet of my life. He endangered the life of my dog and ignored my concerns. I feel like that is almost illegal or some sort of malpractice. Does he even really have a degree? I find it odd that they don't even list their doctors on their site like every other practice. Maybe someone should have them checked? Multiple things he said were entirely inaccurate and I have confirmed that through other vets. I am incredibly lucky my dog was fine despite this "doctor's" ignorance and negligence.

TLDR: Downey Veterinary Hospital's Veterinarian tried to kill my dog. I can see why they have good reviews, but that's because most people are coming in with relatively healthy dogs for well priced vaccines and basic care. If your dog has anything remotely serious, stay far away.<//review>

Please do not visit for the sake of your pet. I took my baby pomeranian that I've had for 6 months to the vet owner of this establishment because my dog was unconscious and had unnormal behavior ... he said he was fine and tried to rush us out of his office. We refused to leave because a  unconsious puppy is obviously not okay, we waited it out until we saw he fine after throwing up, he were returned back to himself. The vet said "oh that's probably what was wrong with him." Which is obvious and didn't take a vet to figure that out. The vet insisted he was ok, just to rush to the next client. Two weeks later my baby pup was unconscious AGAIN, this time after he threw up he died with 5 minutes. This was not only devastating but proved that the vet did not know what he was talking about. When I called the vet back to let him know he was wrong, and also to request a refund of $29. He said no, I mention to him that this was a act of malpractice , he cut me off from talking and without sympathy said oh well, and I'm not giving you a refund and hung up on me. I beg you please DO NO go to this establishment it is simply about money for them. I really don't want anyone else to hurt as I did. I'm currently in the process of developing a case to sue which you can do if any of you run into a similar situation!< /Text>

Also Dr.Raymond was great in answering all my questions and I really appreciate him following up with me. This place truly cares about your pets like they are their own.

A great place to go!!! Have done gel mani and pedi and it lasts long. They always take good care of me and my cousins and friends. (Hence we all go there for many years now) During this time they have really taken great safety precautions.<//text>

Gel mani + pedi + eyebrows
I loved my nails they were done by Amy.
She was so nice and helped me choosing a similar pink for my pedi. Enjoyed the massage chair as well.< /text>

The lady didn’t do a great job, my nails were unevenly shaped, but not less than 24 hours and one of my gel nails completely peeled off. Very bad quality products and service.

Update: another gel nail peeled off minutes after I posted the initial review. Save your money, go literally anywhere else or just do it at home!<//text><rate>1<//rate></record>

Con- my paint job had bubbles that they tried to say was my fault for putting it to close to the fan when it was really the nail tech rushing to do someone's eyebrows
The shape looked good till she painted them then you could see that some was not good at all
Price is a little high. I usually pay 10 to 13 bucks for my feet, here it was 25 and my had s was 25 because I added a design that was trash. I told my nail tech to come up with something fun. She acted like she couldn't do it so she called someone else to do the design. She gave me the old fashion design and asked me what I thought. I told her if thats the best you can do I guess. At that point i was just ready to go. On top of that they kept trying to get me to do silver when I wanted gold. Of I'm telling you gold is my color that I want don't tell me silver would look better. Smh I will never go back<//review><gmapID>0x80c2c7e717ee01bb:0x7dca07419c6772f6</gmapID>< pics>

<review>It's my first time coming here. The only thing I liked about my nails is the color. I asked for coffin & my nails look more square than coffin. (Well I like my coffin more narrow at the top). My nail tech also left glue around my nails as you can see in the picture. He didn't clean. The lengths aren't equal on both hands . I had to remind him to fix it but he didn't fix them enough & I just ended up not saying anything Bc I felt like I was asking for too much. I also had to ask him to cut my regular nails. Or else it wouldn't have happened. I payed $26. I guess you get for what you pay for? 🤷🏽‍♀️< /review><GmapID>0x80c2c7e717ee01bb:0x7dca07419c6772f6< /GmapID>< userid>

The lady told me to seat on the massage chair, so I told her I didn't want massage but she still let me seat there. At the time of paying the lady at front desk was charging me 20 when it supposed to be 16. I let her know I didn't get the massage so I wanted my change but she said no with an attitude. I explained her again that I hadn't gotten the massage and she just ignored me. I didn't want to argue and I  just left .

I've gone there for 7 years since I was in undergrad and have never had a problem with infections which you might expect from a lower price point salon.

<Text>I've been here before in the past and never had have any problems until today. I came by around 12 pm asking if they had anyone available for eyebrows and they said no. They told me to come back around 3pm or 4pm and that they would have people. I was ok with it, until I come back only for them to tell me the same thing... we don't have anyone, we are busy. Then why tell me to come back? Or why not tell me anything about making an appointment?  Like I could have just done that in the beginning instead of them telling me to come back later for nothing. It's just dissappoting honestly.</Text>< Pics>

<review>I went to go get my nails done for my anniversary and I hate the way they came out. I asked for a medi/pedi French tip and while she was doing my nail she messed up on one n just  covered it up with more nail polish. It came out looking bumpy and some of my other nails look crooked.  Yeah the prices might look good but the quality is shity. Not even worth the money I spent anyways.</review>< pics>

<text>BEWARE !!!!  The price they quote you is not what you will be charged.  I was quoted an " Out the door price" with certificate and then the price mysteriously changed by the time they finished the 5 minute test. DO NOT USE THIS BUSINESS!!!!  He quoted me $49 out the door with certificate, then it became $69 when we were on site, no explanation.< /text><username>M Correia< /username><user_id>107013632447824285684< /user_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< date>

Upon initial drive up I was told the smog price would be $85 plus certificate which I then questioned because it was a $20 higher base than everywhere else in town. The owner then begrudgingly agreed to $80 total(which was still high but I was already there so I decided the convenience was worth it). After he smogs my truck (and it passes the emissions test) he casually says you didn’t pass. I ask why and he points to the catalytic converters and says those aren’t CA compliant, I couldn’t find a number on them. I get down under the truck, and low and behold there is a huge stamped number on both, read them off to him and he says alright. Then he points to the CA specific headers and says those don’t have a number stamped on them. I climb into the engine compartment and point at the easily readable number on the headers and he persists to say that is a part number. So I left dumbfounded and went to do my own research. Yes Babak, that is a part number that is very easily referenced on the ca.gov C.A.R.B. website. I called him back to take him up on the free retest he offered but he then backtracks and says he will have to charge me again. What?!  So essentially he took my money to fail a good emission system.
Do your job correctly, not assuming everyone is wrong.
He may be able to handle stock vehicles, but don’t waste your time otherwise.
Thanks for just wanting to take my money.

No you didn’t retest my vehicle. Thanks for more BS however.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<review>The man working there and doing the registration is very kind, but he doesn't have access to do quite *everything*. I paid a late fee that he wasn't able to clear when I wasn't late and I got a notice in the mail that my registration was incomplete. I called the CHP (my car is out of state and I had to do an extra check) and the CHP vin checker was able to clear me. This is a great place for locals and most everyone else because the fee is worth not going to the DMV--- as long as it works.<//review><Rating>4<//Rating><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

If you're in the San Diego area and need to smog your car, this is the ONLY place to go! I take all of my cars here and I've always been more than satisfied with the business. Super fair pricing, fast, convenient, and very professional. The owner is amazing and he truly takes care of his customers.</text>

Older gentleman would not re-test without charging the full $89 fee again.  My understanding was that they would retest again for free.  Disappointing.  I went somewhere else.

Maybe we got off on the wrong foot as I called ahead for an appointment, I arrive on time, he asks me to wait 15 minutes.< /Review>

We have been having issues trying to find someone that would smog our 1999 jeep because a lot of people don't want to take the time, however he opened his doors with open arms and was nothing but friendly and knowledgable. He explained everything as he was testing it and when it failed offered a free retest and had wonderful customer service. Will definitely recommend him to anyone and will be visiting again in the future.< /text>

Quick service but I won't go back. I called before and was quoted $39 as the standard price. When I got there $39 was the "deal" price and didn't include a recheck. Ended up$54.25 after the state fees.

Clearly heard the attendant tell the person who was paying before me $40 out the door (but to be fair he may have been military).

Called speedy smog around the corner on Hancock and was told $41 out the door for the same service.

Go elsewhere.< /Text>

I took my Honda civic hybrid to the dealer to have it smog checked. They told me it would cost $220 because it was very complicated requiring a complex highway driving pattern and analysis. That was quite a lot so I went to All Smog on Midway Drive for a second opinion. Bobby looked at the car and told me he could do the complex pattern and smog my car for about 1/3 what the dealership wanted. I am taking all my smog business to Bobby and would recommend him without any reservation. Thank you Bobby.< /text>

I called earlier in the week for a quote on my car which was $39.00. When I arrived on Friday, he wrote $54.00 on the service ticket stating that the coupon was no longer applicable but he would perform the services for $45.00. I left without services ; the coupon remains advertised.

Can't recommend this place enough! I've had 6 cars over the last 7 years and smog tests have been a non-stop headache. So much of my time has been working on my car after a long day at work, trying to get that damn check engine light off so I could pass smog, register and not have to deal with it until I bought my next beater.
Sam did me right. Straight shooter with great customer service skills. I told him I was worried about not passing smog and he said that he wouldn't charge me anything until I Passed! I couldn't believe it and have never heard anything like that before. Big fan of this spot. Come here and let Sam help you out with Smog.< /Review>

Great service! My vehicle had to be tested twice because my state wouldn't accept the inspection. I had it retested for California and they didn't charge me for the retest!</Text>

Awesome experience for a SMOG station.  My BMW was being fickle in disabling the traction control for the dyno.  The owner very patiently worked with me through the issue until we were finally able to pull a couple fuses to get it disabled.  Furthermore, if you have a very low car, this station has an in-ground dyno - no scraping!  I'll be taking my cars to this station in the future and highly recommend this little owner-operated shop to anyone reading these reviews.< /review>

Very inconsiderate and unprofessional. Saw me but never greeted me, just looked away.  Pulled my car up and tried several times to get the attendant's attention.  He ignored me just talking away on his phone.  Finally he heard me start my car and begin to drive away....he pointed at me to come back still chatting away on the phone. I said," you don't seem to want my business. ...he said, "that's fine with me." And walked away.<//text>

Jan 6: Oh snap!  My registration is almost due!!!
(I do it online and then...) wha? it's incomplete!?!  Smog check?  Fu** my life!

Jan 16: At Pep Boys
Service desk guy: "All my guys left for the day so instead I'm going to give you the 'I hate you and I'm always right' stare"

Jan 18: I call All Smog Check
Me: "Can you do a smog test for me at 11:30?
Bobby: "Sure! Btw I know you can't see me but I'm probably smiling"
Me: "Awesome!  Can you have it done by 12:30?"
Bobby "I can do that!"

(11:30 I show up)

Bobby: "How'd you hear about us?"
Me: "My friend mentioned that you are awesome and mentioned that you have live palms in your store"
Bobby: "Cool!"
Me: "Yay!"

(Eat lunch (appox. 20 min) then come back)

Me: "Do you have a place I can sit down while I wait for you to finish?"
Bobby: "It's already done!"
Me: "Wwwwwhhhhaaaaaaaa!?! My life is the shiz!"< /Review>

<review>Absolutely terrible! This place was a total rip off he told me I could get a free re test and even wrote it on my receipt but then charged me again when I brought the car back and told me he made a mistake giving me the free test. Do not ever go here if you love your car.< /review>< userid>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>Neither my friend or I were impressed by this place. We stopped by after a nice hike. We were starving. I didn't like the salsa they put in the burrito. We were really excited when we saw the rotisserie for the al pastor tacos. However they were just ok. They completely forgot about our tacos and I had to go ask for them. The strawberry water was really good though<//review>< Pictures>

Short Review: My go-to pizza, sandwich, salad, etc. spot for the family of four.  5 Stars for years now.
Longer:  Our favorite pizza in the Valley for 10 years. If you haven't tried the Armenian pizza or Khachapuri (like a pizza dough "boat" with cheeses, meat if you like, and sunny side eggs on top), you really should.  The meatballs... I don't think I've placed an order without getting the appetizer meatballs, or the sandwich.  Great service and a local gem.<//Review>

<review>When I think of eating authentic Mexican food I think or this Taqueria in the MIssion.  Today I left disappointed.  The tacos barely had any meat.  It was a combination of fat with tiny pieces of meat.  The shrimp plate was tasty but the shrimp had not been cleaned.  You could see the insides were packed with waste.

The prices are still pretty decent at least.  The restaurant itself was not clean.  This place has historically had pigeons inside looking for left overs, but even then it was fairly clean.  I was shocked to see a silver serving dish marinating in the bathroom sink.

Sad to say it's my last time here!!< /review>< Pictures>

<review>I tried the fried Fish (pescado frito) it has not flavor at all, just oily fish and nothing else. The  rice and beans are not bad but the fish is not good. My daughter ordered “tacos dorados” and are not good either, just one taco in the center had sour cream and some ugly lettuce but the others nothing but fried chicken with not flavor inside and ugly served. My husband ate beef tacos and he liked them. Looks like just meat tacos are fine. I’m Mexican, I grew in Mexico and I know the good Mexican food, this is bad food.</review>< username>

This place is great. Pro tip, go here at dinner time when the Al Pastor is being cooked fresh on the patio. Best street taco I’ve had in 5yrs hands down.</review>

VERY PRICEY AND THE FOOD WAS HORRIBLE

HOW CAN THEY USE IT AND SERVE SOMETHING SO NASTY
OBVIOUSLY THEY DONT CARE CAUSE THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT CHARGING YOU
THE PEOPLE WERE SO RUDE AND I WOULD NEVER GO BACK THERE NEITHER RECOMMEND IT
WORSE PLACE IN THE MISSION DISTRICT<//text>< Pics>

this place sells my favorite burritos in sf. they have a taco stand in there also. rice is always flavorful and moist, portions are reasonable and price is lower than average for sf. there's always a good crowd there; it's clearly popular!< /Review>

I have been going here for years. The food is always good. Definitely recommend getting tacos after late night drinking lol. If going in just for something to eat then the chimichanga is one of the best to order.<//Text>

this place sells my favorite burritos in sf. they have a taco stand in there also. rice is always flavorful and moist, portions are reasonable and price is lower than average for sf. there's always a good crowd there; it's clearly popular!< /Review>

<Review>The meat is good and juicy on the tacos but the tortilla gets soggy quickly. They also charge 2-3 more on card and you don’t know there was an extra charge until you leave. I got 4 tacos for what I thought and what the cashier told me was $12 then once I checked my bank, I found that they charged me $2 extra.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<text>Really nice tacos!  We tried a bunch of them, from the pig neck to the chorizo to the al pastor, all quite lovely.  Self service toppings.  Tacos were like $3 each.  They had a sign for barbacoa tacos (pit cooked lamb) but they didn't have it when we were there.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

It was ok, but the person serving the food was being stingy with the portion of meat. Other people in line said something to the cook too. But the carnitas are really good. But when I went to order more they were out in that few time I was out..  The grilled chicken was ok but it taste more boiled then grilled and its in chunks & not shredded.<//review>

<text>A few of places opened late at night. Food was great. I got the carne asada burrito and it was out of this world. Very authentic and seem to be very covid safe as the lady taking orders told someone that didnt have a mask on to put one on before taking his order.  There is also outdoor seating.</text>< pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Legit fantastic tacos at reasonable prices in a no-frills, very colorful spot in the Mission. You know a taqueria is good when your selective Mexican friends have cravings for the food; Taqueria Vallarta has that kind of credibility. Favorites here are the lamb barbacoa, pork carnitas, beef suadero, and lengua tacos, and I am interested in trying the buche (pork neck), which you don't see in many places.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Great local spot for tacos...they had 8 diffedent styles when i came by and of course i had to get one of each...and at only 3.00 each its a grear deal in a city thats hard to find good cheap eats...the tacos are mexican street style so a bit smaller than other places but so flavorful and more filling than they appear.

<user_id>112773697120716888231<//user_id><Text>A stripped down, clean menu of things I didn't recognize. So enticing! And very good value for money. Reasonable prices for flavorful dishes.
I don't mean to imply that the menu is limited, or narrow; there are options  - oh yes, there are options. But the selection has the feel of being pared to the best of the best. I inferred that there had been a dozen other dishes which had simply been left behind, with only the really special things remaining.
Find something familiar or foreign, and enjoy!</Text>< Gmap_id>

The best vegetarian super burritos in SF. If you're staying away from meat and want a burrito that includes something other than rice, they have eggplant, cauliflower and other great veg options.< /Text>

Keep your expectations on the food...this is not a romantic special occasion place...this is just great food for a fair price, it's open late, the portions are big, the staff is cool and you watch the cooks preparing orders while youre in line.l It's a very civilized way to eat...being able to see the food first.

I Love Love Love

The taco bar and salsa bar.

The beef tripe or intestine tacos are awesome

The Lengua is awesome as well

I once got a chorizo burrrito and it was too salty for me , I’d stick to the tacos and get a side of rice and beans .

This place is awesome !< /text>

Food was good,  but the dining area was covered in garbage from past eaters.  They are really good at taking your order and your money,  but not so much in keeping their restaurant clean and not run down looking.< /text>

Food is great there. They have a taco stand open till break of dawn, for all people craving tacos at 3 am  or 4am, it will be open at that time to get your tacos craving. Their other dishes are delicious as well. Did notice they hiked up their price, but understand San Francisco/ bay Area isn't cheap at all< /text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>They raised their taco prices from $2.50 to $3.
I've never been able to try their tacos because I don't eat meat (vegetarian mostly but pescatarian when I'm being flexible) - but many friends have raved about the tacos here.

From a vegetarian/pescatarian eater point of view, I wouldn't really recommend taqueria vallarta. I've tried the quesadillas, burritos, and plates but I've never been impressed. There are plenty of other vegefriendly taco spots, this just ain't it.< /review>< Pictures>

One of the best places to get street tacos in San Francisco. Nothing fancy but they have a huge variety of meats for their tacos, burritos, and other food. This place makes me feel like I'm back in Mexico, but the food quality is even better.</review>

Probably the only food place open late on weekdays in the area. Very suitable for those late nights after coming home from a party, concert, etc. and you need a cheap little snack (or 2) to complete the evening.

I've only had the tacos here (not really a burrito person), and the quality of the meat has been consistently amazing. They are only $2.25, too. So many options to choose from - go for more of the fatty meats as they are usually most juicy. We love al pastor.

Environment and ambience is that of a typical Mexican restaurant. If you are looking for a modern, spot clean taco place, this is not going to be it. But if you want a real Mexican environment, check this place out.

There is tons of seating available and it never gets too crowded. That alone makes it better than La Taqueria (the overrated and crowded one!)

Definitely recommended.<//text>

<Text>Best taco I've ever had. There are a number of places I'd rather go for burritos or other Mexican food, but for tacos it's always Vallarta. My favorites are the pollo and al pastor. Don't forget the grilled onions!</Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Date>

They advertise their vegetarian options pretty heavily out front, (see photo) but they are kind of strange flavors like “Italian blend” and “stir fry”. Not stuff I’ve ever wanted in a burrito. Tried the regular veggie burrito made vegan with black beans. Not a lot of flavor and likely lots of cross contamination given the amount of meat/seafood being prepped nearby. At $10, it is pretty steep for a Mission burrito. On the plus side, this place is open late past 10pm.</text>

It's a good place to eat late at night.  The food is just ok. The tortillas from the tacos were not that good.< /Review>

The rest of the menu is standard fare, and seems to be pretty solid. The agua frescas are good.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

The tacos were extra greasy. Be careful as pricing changes depending if you pay with a credit card vs. Cash. Make sure you have cash on hand so you don't overpay as the food is already expensive for what it is.< /review>

This informal taqueria is a local's favorite. The setting is simple, with paper plates, and counter service, but the tacos are delicious. Have yet to try other things but I will be back. Everyone speaks Spanish there, which is a very good sign!!</Text>

<Text>Why is it that almost no taquerias in the city have a fish burrito option? Except for Taqueria Vallarta that is!

May have come here QUITE a bit in the 2am wkend sitches back in the day. Now I simply enjoy their super fish burritos nice and sober. And for lunch. Or dinner. But frankly it’s good at any time.

Is it just me or has burritos in SF become extraordinary expensive? Well, I suppose that’s a SF everything sort of sitch. But really, $16 for a burrito? It’s a lot. But it’s good. 4 stars.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I absolutely love this place; this is as legit as it gets.  The tacos are amazing, and cooked to order before your eyes.  There is a great selection of meats, including my favorite, lengua (beef tongue).  I haven't tried the cesos (brain), but it's there for you.  I also haven't tried the vegetarian burritos (including cactus), but they have an impressive selection of those as well.

Every square inch of the walls and ceiling is covered with murals.  They do have bottled beer.  Best of all, they are open until like 4am or something.  I recommend paying with cash ;)<//review>

We miss the Mission and this is by far my favorite taqueria for food, wall art and atmosphere especially when the taco stand is running in full swing. This place hasn’t changed in the 14 years I’ve been tacoing it up.<//Review>

<Text>Every time I make a trip to the city, I stop in here for a few tacos. These are the best tacos I've had since I left Arizona. It's fantastic to be able to order right at the door and have it ready on the plancha as soon as you walk in.</Text><date>1507089696647</date>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Authentic Mexican food. Reasonable prices and friendly staff, though it does help to speak a bit of Spanish. Places like this are why the Mission still retains some of its charm and authenticity.<//Review>< date>

I can only comment on the tacos, which are good and offer more than enough meat choices. The only thing I'd change about them is the tortillas; they taste store bought.< /Text>

Giving this a 5 stars for awesomeness. They have a taco bar and yes they are that busy so get yourself some tacos before ordering a burrito! Love the staff and they have nice restrooms.</review>

<Review>This place is only for when you get out of the club or bar at 2am, drunk and hungry, not really carring about how clean or good the food is, we visited this place around 3pm with kids, and we ordered 2 chorizo tacos, they were squishy, and oily. 2 tripitas tacos, which the tripitas were cut into 2in pieces that looked extremely unappetizing, i mean its intestines at least chop it up into smaller pieces!! We also had 2 suadero tacos, it's supposed to be TENDER beef, the meat was like a chicharron, hard and dry. Never visiting again. On top of that, the lady who was on le register kept yelling to the cook how stupid he was, and how useless, as well as complaining about previous customers, when we approached her she excused herself by saying that she had diabetes and she looses track of what she is doing. Totally inappropriate. NEVER EVER EVER!!!!< /Review>< user_id>

Definitely one of my favorite taquerias in SF. They have a huge vegetarian menu, and their burritos are always great and their salsa bar is super spicy--love it. I've also heard their taco bar is amazing, but it's all meat 😔</text>

<Text>I LOVE THE TACOS HERE!  The meat is seasoned perfectly, the tortillas are delicious, and all of the fixings including: cilantro, limes, radishs, diced onions, three types of salsa, and grilled onions are absolutely perfect to adorn each taco.  I always bring friends here and tell them they are the best tacos...they never disagree after they sample two or three different types of meat.

They just raised their prices though...tacos are now $2 each.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< user_id>

One word: Tacos!  Honestly don't bother with the rest of their menu, I've had hit-or-miss experiences with the California Super Burrito (miss), the nachos (miss), and the Chilaquiles (huge miss). However their tacos are some of the best in the mission.  Definite hit!</text>

Their meats for tacos are so good, all their combinations plates on the menu are also very delicious. As I'm concern I put them as the number 1 Taqueria in all Northern California, when I have family members visiting from out of state and they are also very picky with their Mexican to Mexican food. They just love it. There is something Magical in the Mission District and I guess this comes from generation to generation of great Mexican people and where there are great people there is great delicious food. And for a fact for you the great founder and chef for Chipotle started there in the Mission District Taquerias in the late 80's early 90's<//review>

<Text>Probably won't venture back to this place after a rough first time there. It's definitely authentic and the food was pretty good, but if you don't speak Spanish, you'll likely have a hard time ordering.

Also, they were all out of ham for breakfast burritos, so we had to settle for pollo, which wasn't nearly as good as hoped. Seems like they should order more ham so that they don't run out so early on a Sunday...</Text><gmap_id>0x808f7e4881a8f4e3:0x373f8a8597252568</gmap_id>< rate>

The two carne asada tacos and one burrito I ordered  were extremely greasy and tasted rare/raw. This is the first time in my life I've ever had a disgusting burrito, had to spit it out and throw it away.<//review>

<time>1340679566864</time><Rating>4< /Rating><Review>The burritos are a decent size and filled with succulent deliciousness.  And guacamole is in the form of chunks of avocado rather than the slimy watered down stuff, which is definitely a good thing.  Overall a good solid burrito.

In the shady accounting side of things, I paid with a $20, the cashier hit the 'no sale' button, gave me my change and the rest went in a pile of ones on the register, which she used to make change for the next three customers behind me. Five finger employee discount or giving the finger to uncle sam? The story tonight on 60 Minutes.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

The food was okay. But the nicest part about this spot was the huge dining room - way bigger than most other taquerias. Plus they had two high chairs in the dining room, a nice surprise when we brought our kids there.</Review>

The taco stand inside the restaurant is a funny idea but the tacos they have are good. The horchata needs Ice and could be of better quality.<//Text>

<Text>If you've been looking for good vegetarian burrito options, this is the place!! So many taquerias have a "vegetarian" burrito on the menu that consists of rice & beans and no veggies. Not here. They have SEVEN different options of different veggie combos to choose from! Call ahead for take-out, or stop in. Fast and delicious.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I was not impressed. Compared to other places around the area the tacos were too greasy,  not tasty. Maybe some of the other tacos are good, but definitely better ones out there.</Text>

The only pluses were that they take credit cards and there was no line. That should have been an indication since two other places I passed had lines out the door on a Saturday night.</review><userid>118221171112949281592</userid><rating>3</rating>< name>

Tacos! The tacos are $2.25 each and they serve all kinds of meat. I ordered tender beef and al pastor then I layered it with onions, cilantro, lime juice and salsa. I've had better from a food truck and I'm totally judging by the meat quantity. I also ordered elote in a cup. It was decent and there was nothing to rave about. It's a chill spot and food always comes out fast.</review>

The two carne asada tacos and one burrito I ordered  were extremely greasy and tasted rare/raw. This is the first time in my life I've ever had a disgusting burrito, had to spit it out and throw it away.<//review>

They were OK tacos. They had a large variety of taco meats which had been sitting on their grill by the time I got to it. Kind of pricey at $3/taco and cash only.< /Review>

< Review>
So I went in here and I ordered a couple of tacos and a quesadilla. The quesadilla was $10.50 but I didn't understand why it didn't even look like a quesadilla and I barely even got my food I waited so long that I didn't want it anymore and when I got it the plate was slid to me disrespectfully and the lady who was serving it was rude. My friend on the other hand got her food way before I did we ordered at the same time. I also order before 12 other people and they all got their food before me. That was the only reason I didn't want my food next to it wasn't worth $10.50 it looks like a burrito half Road without beans rice and lettuce. Like I told the lady who took my order and my friend I would not be coming back there the service sucked. And where the guy was cooking was a mess. And from the looks of it he looks like he makes the orders in the order he wants to not as they come< /Review>

< Review>
You people are some of the most delicious in all of the mission. Especially past 2am when the hunger is strong and the need for tabletop fried intestines with radish and hotsauce is greatest! The tripas had been of varied texture, consistency, flavour, as has everything really, depending on person working the tabletop fry contraption.  This is not a bad thing. It's like being able to go to 4 different taco places all in one spot. Seating is ample, drunk super hotties stumbling around  (ok ok swaggering is better. Nay! Sauntering!!! Yes that much much better!) , whilst their dudes sit and stare at anyone who dares gaze overly intently on the skin tight white jeans or 3 size to small see through tops.... mmm mm did I say they have a really friendly and super nice staff as well as tacos? Oh. Good. It's true. Go here you plebs! Now! (Or wait till night and for tequila first)</Review>

One of the few places in San Francisco or maybe? the only one with true tacos similar to mexico and the variety does not anywhere have it, employees always very in a good mood.< /text>

A great local institution on 24th. I've depended on it a bit too much for spontaneous quick eats (either the taco bar, or the super burritos al pastor). They also have more significant meals, of which I particularly enjoy the Siete Mares - a soup with about as much different seafood as you would expect in the same bowl together. Great value either way you go. Don't forget to grab the orange sauce!< /text>

The most dirtiest taco place in Frisco I promise I will never eat food here because my experience was awful as I walked into the place the first thing I see is an old wet mop at the entrance of the door the place was extremely loud and ness the trash was all over the place and after I made my order I stood against the wall for twenty five minutes waiting for my food. They gave ne the wrkng order and the food smelled disgusting I hated it.<//Text>

<text>This used to be my favorite place to get tacos until last night I got food poisoning from their prawn burrito, and my husband got sick from their tacos. Either the ingredients are bad or unsanitized food handing. Very disappointed!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<review>First time here in a few years, the quality was on point - the prices have gone up to an upper mid-tier taqueria but there was a lot going on here.  A woman was on one side making and selling elote (mexican style corn), also a taco cart on the another side.  A lot of space to sit down inside too and kept decently clean.<//review><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808f7e4881a8f4e3:0x373f8a8597252568</gmap_id>< Date>

Al Vapor Tacos till late...TILL 3AM!!! Fresh meat cooked streetside, and not just your normal steak and pork. They have the whole head-to-tail mexican cuisine.

<Review>Yuck!!!!! VOMIT!!!!! Disgusting, do not go!!! They tried to sell us spoiled food, and would not refund us. I bought a taco from the taco bar, and you could smell the spoiled meat, that nasty sour smell. We also ordered Menudo, and first of all there wasn't any Homny, second the meat smelled bad, sour and gross. We didn't even touch our food and I asked for a refund. The store manager said "no" and I wasn't going to put up a fight, so we left. Never go here!!!
San Fran you need some real Mexican food restaurants!! Take SAN diego Mexican restaurants for example.< /Review>< pics>

I was highly recommended here, very dissapointed.

First the cashier kept talking to me in english when i crearly was talking spanish this was very sad
Second she didnt want to bring my food to the table she haf me get up no napkins she also kept eating and chewing like a cow while i was ordering
I also ordered 2 tripe tacos meat tasted and felt like it was recooked like 5 times
Overall flavor was meehh for the burrito

Surely never going back to this place

Not sure if they are owners or just employees but they need to learn to be more humble<//review>

Solid food with big portions. Tacos are the line in the front and made to order. Salsas are quite spicy even pico de gallo. Habanero really gets to you after alittle time. A bit down and dirty but nicer than faralito and cancun.<//text>

< Review>
I've stopped by several time for tacos at night when everything else is closed. Tacos are cheap and served late into the night. Authentic, traditional tacos with a variety of meats such as chorizo, al pastor, carne asada, etc, topped with cilantro, onion, and salsa.

The place is covered in murals and has as lively atmosphere.</Review>

Two of us had shrimp quesadillas. This place has the typical taco stand within the restaurant. You just go there and choose out your ingredients and watch your taco being made.

The quesadillas were great. They are the common quesadilla that you find here in the bay, folded almost like a buritto with no top and bottom. The ingredients were all fresh and well prepared.

This place is just a solid taqueria. You can't do wrong by going here.< /text>< pics>

Taqueria Vallarta is my favorite place to go for tacos in SF. They have about 10 different types of meats so you can try all the weird ones. Hands down my favorite is al pastor. I can eat about 4 and they usually put a lot of meat on top with 2 tortillas per taco, so what I like to do is separate the tortillas and meat so that they are equally distributed. This gives me more room for salsa, fresh cilantro and onions. Really can't beat the price and convenience.

Last year I think the 24th street location was closed for a few months because they found out widgeons were living in the ceiling. I was severely disappointed, since 24th street is closer to me than the 16th/mission location.  One does not go to Taqueria Vallarta for cleanliness or ambience, you go there for great tacos!

I love al pastor.< /Text>

We wanted something quick and 'affordable'.  We both had tacos. Based on reviews I had read I was gunning for 5 tacos. Thank goodness the fella setting up the tacos misheard me and gave me 4 tacos... or maybe he did hear me and thought I was over-ordering... at any rate 4 was more than enough for me and I am a good eater.

I had:
Pollo Asado
Carne Asada
(2) Al Pastor

Hubs had:
Pollo Asado
Carne Asada
Chorizo

We both agreed hands down Pollo Asado was the best. I found this shocking, I don't usually order chicken at taquerias because I try to choose something I wouldn't make at home (we make a lot of chicken at home). Normally, Al Pastor or Carnitas are my go to. I wouldn't order the Carne Asada, Chorizo or the Al Pastor again. But I would definitely get Pollo Asado and try some other choices.

Cantaloupe Aqua Fresca was amazing (we took 3 to go), Hibiscus Aqua Fresca was good but too sweet for me to order again.

It's a cute (not cozy) interior with lots of murals to look at. Lots of tiled tables with benches.

Next time, I'm getting corn with mayo and queso and a bunch of tacos. We'll be back.</text><resp>None<//resp>< Pictures>

I bought a couple of coupons from groupon and went straight to work. I bought the tacos and burritos so thats what I'm gonna base my reviews on. Depending on certain days, the meat are really good and sometimes they can be really dry. I got a chicken burrito which was fairly good for its price which was $5.25 I think... The chicken and rice was moist and nothing taste out of the ordinary. The tacos were nice but I think they're overrated compared to the other reviews. Its just your typical taco but they have a salsa bar with a lot of different stuff such as cilantro, different salsas, toppings and etc. What I recommend is the Lengua and Cabeza because they're underrated meat. A lot of Americans never heard of these meat selections and will probably never try it because they don't want to leave their comfort zone but I love it. The meat texture is new and unique and that brings something different to the table besides the typical carne asada and pollo. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a quick cheap bite.< /Text>

First meal in SF and some of the best tacos I've ever had. I ordered one lengua (tounge), one cabeza (head) and one pollo (chicken). The chicken was a great and one of the beef was superior to the other, but I don't know which was which. Awesome toppings bar and make sure to ask for caramelized onions on top. Each taco is just $1.75. Washed it down with horchatta which was sweet (and more expensive than the taco's at $2.00!).</Text>

$3/taco, nice meat + salsa + topping selection

be wary if the meat falls on  your clothes tho, some meat oil found its way to my light grey coat and the stains were a bit difficult to remove 🤣🤣</Review><UserId.>102981846708938236716<//UserId.><gmap_id>0x808f7e4881a8f4e3:0x373f8a8597252568< /gmap_id>< Response>

(Translated by Google) We ordered 6 tacos and two soft drinks, $ 23. The barbecue tacos, Suadero, tongue and tripitas, we only liked the barbecue, the very hard meat soft and the more greasy triplets than normal.

(Translated by Google) The tacos are fine. But the service is a disaster. The cashier, who attended to me according to what I was told is a close relative of the owner, is always in a bad mood. She's a poor employee in the wrong place.

(Translated by Google) Here is a good Mexican restaurant very nice and typical, with a large flow, close to the streets where you can admire the most beautiful frescoes of "street art" in San Francisco !! An incessant back and forth of locals, who come to taste, among other things, tacos at $ 3 per unit made up as you wish at the dedicated stand !! Beware of the spicy sauces that you will add to your tacos !!! It "moves" !!! it will take more than one "cerveza" to put out the fire, if your hand is too heavy !!

Un va et vient incessant de locaux, qui viennent déguster entre autre, des tacos à 3$ l'unité composés a votre guise au stand dédié !! Attention aux sauces pimentées que vous rajouterez sur vos tacos !!! Ça "déménage"!!! il faudra plus d'une "cerveza" pour étreindre le feu, si vous avez la main trop lourde !!< /Review>
