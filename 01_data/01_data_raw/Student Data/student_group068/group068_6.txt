<text>It was my first to come to this place for the celebration. The tea and snack we ordered was really good.Room is kinda small but enough for 3 people. We were expecting to have a hello kitty room but nope haha. The staff there was so nice and provided us plates,forks,and a knife,and the lighter too( very important for the cake lol
The price is acceptable too,so I would definitely recommend ;)<//text>< pics>

<Text>Very good service and good song list. However, English songs are a bit hard to navigate. I came here several times with my friends and one of them was a mini goodbye party to friend before jetting off to Japan to study aboard.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmap_id>

A good place with a large number of asian (especially Chinese and Cantonese) songs (They do have many English songs as well). However the microphones they provided is not so good, because the battery of the microphones runs low very quick. Other than that everything is great.  Free parking with 1 hour. I parked there for more than one hour and seems it is still fine.< /Review>

We had a work-related party at Energy Karaoke last night and I cannot praise the staff enough.  From our first contact to book the space throughout the entire party, everyone was professional, helpful, and FUN!  Special THANKS to Brian, Toto, and the KJ (Frank?-not sure of his name) who helped make the party extra-special for the guest of honor.  We will be back!</Text>

Friendly service, but limited songs on their machines and their kitchen was closed on the day we went. We could only order drinks and couldn't bring in our own food to supplement the lack of food available.< /Review>

Karaoke catalog is hard to search English songs with. Songs and artists are not in alphabetical order, and searching for a complete word or name will bring up no results.

However, staff was very accommodating, and parking wasn't too bad despite it being in a busy plaza.</review>

Low quality trashy place. Bad parking setup. Drinks are overpriced for whats essentially sugar water. Song selection process takes longer than actually singing. 1/10, not 1/5.</text>

Worst Karaoke place ever! So recently my friend got into an accident and she couldn't show up. However, we reserved the room for 7 people and we had to pay for the extra person. How hard is it to show a sense of humanity and just deduct $14 from the bill? I would understand if my friend showed up and left but she couldn't even show up because of a huge car accident. Do you expect her to crawl out of the hospital and go there???  Worst customer service ever too, the person that picked up when we called, showed no respect what so ever. Service here sucks too. They make people pay an unreasonable amount for tip even though, they do absolutely NOTHING. They also have hidden fees that aren't upfront and you don't realize until you pay. ALSO, the playlist software is EXTREMELY annoying. Yes, the song selection would've been nice if you were still stuck in the early 2000s. How is this place still in business? I would give it a 0 star review if I could. I would rather go home and go on youtube and search up song karaokees. It's free and has a much better selection...<//review>

3.5 stars~ energy was touted as one of the nicer KTV in SoCal, and while it has a modern veneer I unfortunately found song selection lacking. The rooms are nice and clean and I liked the iPad system. The service was also great with an employee taking drink orders and consistently checking to see if everything was working.

Most of the old music videos were actually accurate and decent, though a few did have the standard "woman walking around foreign country." I just wish they organized the system so it's easier to find newer songs. The highlight was definitely the service, they adjusted room temperature, took care of drinks, and were generally friendly.< /Review>

I dont think they are using legit karaoke copies. Many MVs are tagged "Taiwan only", or "HK,  Macao only". Also, too few English songs.< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Sound insulation is a bit bad, service sound effects are all right, the main problem is that the song is a bit less, than the K-meter system used everywhere is much less, although mainly because I mainly like Japanese songs

(Original)
隔音有点糟糕，服务音效什么的都还可以，主要问题在于歌有点少，比到处都用的K米系统的曲库少多了，虽然主要是因为我主要喜欢日语歌<//text>< gmapID>

I am talking about the man at the front desk who adjusted the air conditioner very cold in the middle of the night. This is a central air conditioner.

<text>Nice park with a small playground. There are courts to play tenis, basketball, and baseball. There are also two areas for picnic. The parking lot is free, small, and gets busy quickly.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOx6QrAksPaImB_PO8sJ-NvxqqfBSa42iNalwOD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7wmdX83Upg_OWc4r7N0nqj5YwqCDpKeeQ-mD_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMS2HDDj6AyBVSuW3AdNbLBVKtItRBZhnUcgOtS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMR_hpA8IgzkRR3VZw1WIJ1jAW4g2WxVQZYwtJL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdV71s1oj33yMcJV55MD37YBtEzqCqlWs9eqSg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdBAocPhsoP8Q8E_oSNPb4PMTtFDAW4SzJTdEV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c2a49e1f4e8007:0x5fa11a32fa56b9f4</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>This is my fantastic local park.  Steeped in history... Rustic Canyon Park lies sequestered among enormous old growth trees that were planted as a forestry experiment back in the 1800s. The Park building dates back to a time when old world creatives like L. Frank Baum (who wrote the Wizard of Oz) had an enclave here called the Uplifters. The building used to be their  clubhouse.  The park has tennis courts, basketball courts, a cute little playground area and they also have lots of great classes like sculpture here.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Home of multiple historical landmarked features including 95+ year old Clubhouse which is being carefully rehabilitated as well as the adjacent eucalyptus grove with original trees planted by Abbot Kinney in the 1880's and new paths, gazebos and plantings to reflect the historic nature of this, the site of the first US Forestry Station.<//review>

<review>We have refinanced with Mission Home Mortgage twice and are very happy with their service. Working with Jamie Rounds was delightful she was very helpful in getting us qualified super fast. Jamie provided us with all the information we needed to secure the excellent rate we were seeking. A very good company to work with and a very knowledgeable person Jamie is to get us our needed requirements for the loan. We highly recommend their service.

We worked with Mike after trying several other companies and individuals.  The reason was the clarity and communication that Mike offers.  Any time we had a question on the numbers he provided an explanation and a clear understanding of all the cost associated with our refinance.  No hidden numbers or surprises like we experience with other people.  He also was very responsive to all our questions and replied in a timely manner.</Text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>It was a pleasure working with Milo. Being a first time home buyer, we weren't quite sure what to expect in this process, and quite frankly were a little intimidated. Milo made things very clear and concise. There were no surprises, and to be honest it went so smooth we were thinking, "something can't be right here." Milo was always willing to help explain the purpose of certain docs and why they were needed. To top it off he got us an amazing rate.</Text><user_name>Shannon Monroe</user_name><user>104283259664989084637<//user><resp>None</resp><rate>5< /rate><GmapID>0x80d954c7939d81fd:0x2100a68c4ba5d8db</GmapID></record>

<text>From the beginning all the way Thru funding my loan,I had the greatest experience with my agent Araceli Alonso was very Professional not to mention she will do what ever it takes to get her word accomplished and makes the entire loan go smoothly with no headaches or hiccups,and for that I thank her and Mission home loans for making it the best Refi home loan.Myself and my family are grateful for that.I truly say Araceli should be praised and commended for her Proffessionalism and taking good care of her customers.I would definitely use Araceli again in the near future & would recommend her to friends/family.< /text><response>None<//response>< userid>

I first met Allan Mellor in fall of 2018. He said that if I really wanted to buy a home that he would make it so. He looked over my portfolio and told me exactly what I needed to do. A few months later I was handed the keys. I then decided to refinance due to the lower interest rates and uncertainty of the market today and he also guided me through that process. Allan is quick to reply, trustworthy and very reliable. He cares about his job and wants to help people. I recommend him and Mission Home Mortgage 100%< /review>

Best refi process ever!  Milo was very knowledgeable/professional, along w/ the others at Mission Home Mortgage.  Best thing about it, was that Milo really took account for the customer and "my" best interests...in obtaining the best scenario/option for me.  Thanks again, Milo and Mission Home Mortgage. Will be talking to you again soon!<//text>

<text>Given the ups and downs of the refi market in the past month and current condition of economical affairs in general, Milo proved to be an expert in his field. He stayed abreast of the news and fluctuations in the finance and loan market and provided timely updates and advice along with the best action plans.  I trust him with my loan financing needs and will be recommending him to people in my circle.

Seamless transaction with Mike Lee. He followed up non-stop to make sure I was taken care of and that I was comfortable with the re-finance.  I would highly recommend and will always use Mike for any of my future re-finances or purchases.</text>

I have worked with Milo Grecian from Mission Home Mortgage twice now. First for my original home loan 2 years ago and a couple of refinances. He is very prompt and extremely easy to work with. He is also quite knowledgeable and was patient every time I went to him with questions and explained things in detail. I would definitely recommend Milo to anybody looking for a consultation with a home loan lender.</review>

The practice is modern, high tech, and extremely clean. The receptionist is friendly and we were even brought back earlier than our appointed time. Dr. Zhao is professional, honest, and explained the treatment plan very well. My mother had a root caries restored. She told me whole process was painless. Overall it was a very pleasant experience.  I highly recommend this dental practice.< /text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I unfortunately suffered a heavy toothache during holidays when there were no dental clinics open. Dr. Zhao has offered consultation and emergency treatment to me out of their working hours. They also followed up with me in the next day when they opened the office. I really appreciate what Dr. Zhao has done for their patients. I would recommend new patients to visit Dr. Zhao’s office for any dental advise or services.</review>

Dr. Zhao and his staff are always very friendly and professional. They care about the health of your gums and teeth and always make sure you're mouth is comfortable, including shaving down a tooth to help with the feel of your bite, thank you!!< /text>

<review>Mark greeted me as soon as I arrived at the house. He had already gone through the whole house with a fine tooth comb. Right away when he started talking to me about the inspection I knew that he was a pro at his job. Mark was well educated about everything when it came to home inspections. He gave me advice on how to maintain things around the house and how to fix or change things. He knew every code in the book, city, county, state and around the area. He even offered his services incase I needed someone to help with some of the work. This is my first home that I'm purchasing and I appreciate Marks professionalism, patients and ability to know so much about the do's and don'ts about a house. Highly recommend him. God Bless Mark and My Family and I wish you a speedy recovery.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80ec133777b31309:0xee89c6c51d47d779</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I used Mark for a home inspection. He was prompt and professional.  He answers all my questions and was honest and forthcoming with things he saw wrong. I trusted his opinion and judgement...and he is a great guy!  I highly recommend Mark for all your inspection needs or contract work.  I’m looking forward to working with him soon. 10 out of 10...

<Name>Dan H<//Name><date>1602701854805< /date><rating>1<//rating><Review>I had my home inspected by the owner Mark Kelly and he missed a very large 1 inch wide crack in the foundation of the house. I found out a couple months after I purchased the home while I was repairing a plumbing leak in the crawl space he also missed. I then had two foundation repair companies inspect the home and conduct a Manometer study and they both concluded the house was tilting down slope and it would need piers to stabilize the bad foundation that Mr. Kelly missed on the inspection report.
The estimates were over $30,000. I sent Mr. Kelly both estimates and told him to run it through his insurance. I called him numerous times and he will not respond. I sent him various emails and he fails to reply. Buyer beware! I would not recommend this Inspection company. The owner is  will not own up to his mistakes! I just want my family's home repaired.

Mark Kelly's response to my review is not Valid. I had the foundation checked by 2 reputable foundation repair companies and they both concluded the foundation was cracked through the footing. If I would have known this ahead of time I would not have purchased the home.
Mark continues to avoid the problem. He doesn't care about his customer after he collects the money. He speaks to his customers through his attorney. Do not hire this inspector, he lacks integrity. He leaves me no choice but to go to court.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>SUPERB !!
We had ON THE MARK HOME INSPECTORS 8/11/2020.
Mr. Kelly is just awesome ! He very thorough. top to bottom, under, over .... He knows what he is doing and he took such good care of us, the client.
Mr. Kelly walked us through every step and kept us informed with a really fun sense of humor ! It was a terrific and insightful experience.
The report came to us in such a timely manner with easy to understand, very user friendly tabs with explanations and photos which are important too !
He is a gem !

Worried & Uncertain.   No longer did I feel this unease after Mark's inspection of my new home.  An extremely knowledgeable individual, Mark is qualified not only by his 20+ years of experience, but also from his professional contractor license.  Mark offered to let me tag along during the inspection, and taught me about the issues, impacts, and resolutions to everything his thorough and well trained eye caught.  Within 12 hours Mark had compiled a nearly 100 page document with every photo and explanation we had covered during the inspection.  He also categorized the issues in a way that was very easy to go back to the Seller as well as prioritize money for repairs.

I am very grateful for Mark's quality work and very affordable prices.  He is a friendly, upstanding, and honest individual that clearly takes personal pride in his work.  I am a firm customer of On The Mark Home Inspectors and you will be too!  Call Mark and you will quickly be certain of the condition of your home or investment purchase.<//text>

I would 100% recommend that you work with Mark for your home inspection.  He arrived on time, spent 2+ hours performing an incredibly detailed inspection of the home, and then gladly spent time educating us about everything he'd seen.  He's clearly very knowledgeable and experienced, and his inspection report confirms that.< /review>

<review>We called Mark with On the Mark a couple months ago for a home inspection. He was very accommodating and worked with our schedule. Once at the home he was very thorough and explained anything and everything that caught his eye. He made suggestions and expressed his opinion openly. Unfortunately that sale fell through. Fast forward a few weeks, we found another home and knew immediately who we wanted for our home inspection - Mark. Mr. Kelly once again worked with our schedule, was very thorough, pointed out all the little and big flaws as well as the work needed. With such a huge investment we value Mark's honesty and thorough inspection. Not only is he very knowledgeable but has a great sense of humor. My husband and I highly recommend Mark with On the Mark Home Inspections.<//review>< pics>

I have had many home inspections over a forty year period.  Mark Kelley with "On The Mark Home Inspection" was by far the best.  Mark is devoted to his work.  It is evident that he really enjoys helping new home buyers determine the condition of their new home.  This purchase is so important, you really need a very good home inspector.     He is prompt, reliable, thorough and very knowledgeable.  Unlike many home inspectors, he has years of experience as a licensed contractor as well.  He is well respected in his field and gave me a referral to a roofing company that was fantastic.  They made time to squeeze me into their work schedule.  I was on a very tight schedule, but, because Mark referred me they came out in 24 hours after 4 days of rain gave me a roof cert and even made a repair free of charge.  I highly recommend Mark Kelley he will do a great job for you and gives the kind of customer service you do not often find these days.  I have hired him for three houses and my realtor was so impressed, he is also using him now.  His pricing was really reasonable.  Thank you Mark!< /text>

I had the pleasure to meet Mark Kelly Owner/Inspector of "On the Mark".
When I sent a list of 3 inspectors to my client to view and to decide who they wanted to do their inspection. After reading reviews....

I must say I was impressed with how he set his self apart from the others. Mark is very knowledgeable and can even do the work if needed.

Mark Kelly's very reasonable, reliable and does a great job walking the client through the inspection as he is educating them along the way.

When your done with the inspection you feel a sense of relief. You know your buyer and/or seller is aware of all defects that may or may not need attention.

I would definitely refer Mark Kelly with "On the Mark".< /text>

Mark was great to work with. He was the inspector for the mobile home my mom is buying. Very thorough from the smallest details to safety needs. He even took the time to educate us on a few things. Thank you Mark!</review>

Hired Mark to do an inspection on a home on my parents' ranch. He was willing to drive quite a distance to do the inspection which we really appreciated. He was prompt, courteous, and did a thorough inspection  of the home explaining each suggested repair as we went along. We received his report in a timely manner & were very happy with his service. He was very easy to work with & I would recommend him to anyone needing a home inspection. Thank you, Mark!< /Text>

When I called Mark to ask him can you do a home inspection for our new home. He was very nice to deal with on the phone.  He was on time and was very thorough when he inspected the house. Thank you again Mark. That's why it's called on the mark. Awesome.</review>

A friend recommend Mark for our home inspection and I am glad we used him. From the first time we talk to getting the house report he has been caring, professional, and to the point. We are first time home buyers and we knew nothing. After working with Mark we have a better understanding of our house. I would definitely recommend Mark to friends and family. Thank you Mark!!< /text>

Mark was very thorough with the inspection and helpful in explaining the details to my clients (buyer's).  He was willing to come back several times to re-inspect after the seller had made repairs.  Mark is very knowledgeable and his added warranties were very helpful for my buyers.< /Review>

I have recommended Mark to every client I represent in Real Estate transactions and will continue to do so. He has to be one of the hardest working most knowledgeable individuals in the industry. Most importantly, he takes the time to walk the property with clients, making sure that they understand what defects he is seeing and how to correct those defects. On the last home he inspected for on of my clients the water was not on during the inspection. He went back out to the property to complete the inspection once the water was turned back on and then went out a third time to amend the inspection following an HOA issue.< /review>

Mark came out same day to help with water damage. He was very clear and easy to talk to. He will be giving me a bid later today. He was more then happy to just tell me what needed to be done so I could do it or use his company to do it. He just wanted to help.< /Review>

He recently did an inspection for me and probably saved my wife and me hundreds of dollars we would have had to spend to correct work previously that was not according to code. We opted to search further. To meet insurance requirements we again called on Mark to check a couple of items. Since he had done a previous inspection, he generously did this job free.

I called On The Mark Home Inspectors and spoke with Mark over the phone.  We set up an appointment and he was on time, which is something that i pride in, due to the busy schedule that I have.  He walk the job and did his inspection and when he was done he told me that he would have the inspection report electronically sent to me that evening.  he proceeded to due exactly what he said he would about getting the report to me like he promised.  I would recommend On The Mark Home Inspectors to friends of mine.  Thanks again for a job done well.</text>

<Text>I'm the process of buying a home and my agent recommended Mark for an inspection so I gave him a call. I have nothing but great things to say about him. Aside from having the lowest prices around he allowed me to tag along during the inspection. He takes his time to find every little detail possible and he likes to  educate people. He gives you tips on how to fix certain things and tells you what needs to be addressed and shows you how to do it.His many years of experience have tought him to see things the average person can't see. He's very professional & treats you with respect but he also likes to joke around so you feel pretty comfortable around him while doing the walkthrough. He makes you feel like a friend and unlike the bigger companies money isn't his priority.
Mark loves what he does and he did a phenomenal job. There's no one better for the job.
5 starts are not enough. I definitely reccomend him. Thank you Mark.<//Text><Rate>5</Rate><gmapID>0x80ec133777b31309:0xee89c6c51d47d779<//gmapID>< Pictures>

<review>He told me the money I paid him was to fix the front and back yard sprinklers but he only fixed one sprinkler in the front yard, had to pay an additional price to pay someone else, also he was to lay rock in the front which I paid him for and he didn't do that and would not credit my money back, also paid him to haul away all the dirt which he did not complete and when I  comfronted him about it he was very rude , he asked me to do him a favor and pay him before all the work was completed because he had to pay his workers, after I did that for him he disappeared and would not credit me for the work not done.<//review><date>1557173104338< /date></record>

I was tested here on 12/22, and I have to commend the hard workers at Total Testing Solutions. Of course, given it's the holidays, they were super busy, but they worked diligently to make sure I was seen in a timely manner. The test itself (nasal swab) was totally bearable, and the nurse that helped me was a caring person.

I would recommend TTS hands down during this crazy time!<//review>

Well when I went 12/21/2020, my appointment was scheduled for 10:00 a.m. and I arrived around 9:30ish. Everything was fine and smooth. Just that they at that time didn’t really have any signage to show where to check in. Yes there were people directing some of the traffic and help guiding but for people come from different directions some signage to point out where to start the check in process would be easier then having other people cut each other off<//review>

THE WORST SERVICE & EXPERIENCE of my life,
I tell them, don't go, the people who are there hear their work they don't like, I made an appointment to take my test on December 14 , (I do not understand why make an appointment) if in the end they do not have the seriousness to receive by order the aforementioned 5.30 hours on line it was really crazy and more if you go with children, several cars I saw that they were screaming and had disagreements with the staff When my turn finally arrives 5.30 hours after the hour of my appointment, a very annoyed girl arrives to ask me again for my data with which I had registered, to which I said here I have my email of the confirmation of the appointment she told me not to give me your id and you have to fill in the data one more time if you want the state to pay for your test if not you will pay? (They are supposed to be free tests) and I asked him why they were 5 hours late, what happened, she told me not to complain, all the cars made the same line and did not say anything, I just asked her why I bring children and it has been Terrible waiting for my gas tank to be low by half luckily I had water to give to the children but it is incredible 5.30 online having an appointment and that they still treat you like this! Well, she told me, you can go get the test wherever you want if it doesn't seem like here, to which I said if I wait so long I'll take it here but it's not the right attitude, she didn't want to continue attending to which I asked another girl. I would attend, which a little less aggressive, started again from scratch to ask for my data again my id (and what do you think did not leave one of the appointments in your system) total that they still had me waiting when another girl finally arrives with open tests Out of the bag the tube which did not seem right to me I told her and she began to scream that she had been there for hours that she was tired to which I said omg I 6 hours there are to eat and with an appointment for that disgusting treatment at the end no They wanted to do the test because I asked them for another closed one and to change the gloves, their treatment was humiliating! I felt very discriminated! Don't go to that place please< /text>

Wish I could do a zero instead of a 1 star! It was the WORST experience ever! 5 hours in line even when I was in time for my appointment! It's finally my turn and they show up with an open swab, and I never saw they changed their gloves. I kindly asked them to provide a new swab on a closed package and they refused to do it. I saw people cars ahead from me arguing and yelling, it's a whole show! Please do your appointment somewhere else, these people were no professionals at all.<//review>

<Review>Online states no appointments needed. We waited 90 minutes in line for them to say "if we can help we will." They tried to turn us away, but, we mentioned that online it stated no appointments needed. So....we waited another  flippen hour to be tested. The 2nd star is for the girl who helped us not the girl who told us we couldn't get tested. I wouldn't have driven here if I knew the appointment was needed. Update: had to call and be on hold for an hour before someone picked up and told me that they didn't send me an email because I never gave it to them I did give it to them after testing site twice.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>The testing site is overwhelmed. I showed up 30 minutes early for my appointment, but they accepted walk-ups and it became first come, first serve. I waited 3 hours for my swab.

When I originally schedule for my test online, the website stated that I was signing up for a test, but didn't say it was mailing me one, nor gave me any information where I was to go. It looked like just a telehealth appointment. Perhaps that was just supposed to be for the screening interview, but that needed to be clarified.

It's day 3 and I am still waiting for test results.

That said, the staff at the site was nice, but clearly overworked.

Thank you Healthcare workers and testers. You are amazing.<//Review>< Pictures>

<date>1609555768147< /date><user_name>Daisy Pedraza<//user_name><Review>I never write reviews! BUT THIS WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE  I have ever had! We went in with an appointment. Prior to that someone from their agency called to ask why we were going in, if we had insurance, and all those covid related questions.  2 1/2 hours later it was finally our turn. I noticed that the staff were NOT changing their gloves as they should.  Some of them were eating on site and drinking while they had their gloves ON!!!!  When getting ID’s and insurance cards they did not wear gloves.  I also noticed that people were walking up to get tested even though they said it was drive thru only.  (Prior to getting in line with my car i got off and asked hey can i walk up and they said NO!) Finally they took our test . I waited 4 days and still no results. Went elsewhere and got them in 2 days. ( we all tested negative)  One week later I get a phone call from this lab and they asked for so and so, i said wrong number, they said well what about this person, they tried various names until they said my sons name, to which they claimed that he tested positive. I told them we just had him tested again because you were taking too long and he tested negative. They said I would be getting a call from the city. I nor my husband and brother who were in the same car as me got our test result, not an email or a call. I never got a call from the city for that "positive " test result from my son nor an email showing proof of this test result!! Take you business elsewhere!</Review><rating>1< /rating></record>

Worst test center I've been to, 8 days later and still no results. They completely mixed up my families test samples, it was only 3 of us, and they don't even show that I took my test on their patient portal. I'm avoiding this place. I went to another center and got my results in one day.< /Text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>I got tested for covid and I received a call stating I tested positive for COVID I immediately quarantined myself. They claimed I was A symptomatic meaning I wouldn’t show any symptoms but I’ve been waiting two weeks and have not received my results. Very disappointing since I have a full time that requires a note.<//text><date>1609324046633< /date>< userid>

Worst decision I made to choose this location. My family also separately tested at a different location with a different company. I waited over 1.5 in line for my appointment while they breezed in and out. The next day, they received their results. It’s been 3 days and I still haven’t heard anything. I can’t reach anyone.<//Review>

The first time I got tested,( a few months back) I was seated when I was tested.  The "horrible experience" I expected was no more than a tickle! This last time brought tears to my eyes. I was standing.< /Text>

Acquaint park with modern swings for the kids and slide enough grass for your dog to have fun running around although this is not a dog park there's plenty of poop stations with bags you can actually barbecue at this park it's really cool part I'm looking because it's right next door to where I live.<//Review>

We have used this park in some way everyday since it opened approximately ten years ago. It’s not big enough for such a large community and it really should have included the land that is now the elementary school to make it a proper park. The lawn is well maintained but the replanting of annuals and perennials is spotting. They recently started to plant cactus and it looks wrong in a family park; not inviting. As mentioned, the poorly thought out Cal Aero school is adjacent to the park and because developers did not give enough land to the playground, the children have PE in the park during the school week, making it hard for residents to lounge and enjoy the park quietly. Also, because they didn’t build enough permanent structures for the school, they built trailers for extra classrooms. Now the park’s aesthetics is thrown off and anyone walking along the south end of the park gets a view of trailers and the dirty backside of the school. It just amazes me that in this newer development, these details weren’t thought out better.< /Text>

The place is lovely. The grass is so well taken care. Big parking lot. Big playground. Great for family picnics and relaxing. I would love to have a party in this park. Take your whole family and have fun.</review>

Love this park, but do not come when school let's out. There are some rude and disrespectful kids from Cal Aero Preserve Academy.</Review>

Good playground and large open grass area. Some tables with shade structure. But there isnt much shade. City can't seem to plant some big trees and create beautiful parklike setting.<//review>

Everyone...from the first greeting to Dr. Deutsch and his amazing team ...went out of their way to make me feel comfortable and secure.  Every question was answered quickly and I didn't experience any pain or discomfort during the Hair Graft Surgery Procedure.  Great job!</text>

The whole staff including the Dr that was assigned to me did a great job, I didn’t know what to expect and I was very pleasantly surprised.  They understand how important there job is to the client and to them personally you can tell they take pride in what they do because there goal is to do the very best for there patient.  That is very evident.
To take there time and to all that work with such a great attitude is very refreshing when you leave there you feel like everything thing is going to be just fine.<//text>

In 2001 I started my hair restoration process at Bosley.  I returned in 2021 to finish my crown and some peaks. So far I rate the whole process 5 stars. The service was top notch and follow up has been amazing.  I will keep updating this review as time goes on.

1 week in,  my discomfort is low and I haven't experienced any swelling.  The first few nights were a bit raw but not unbearable.  The medicine helped alot.

Tomorrow I plan to resume most of my normal routine.< /Text>

<Text>Nothing else
To say bc I told person who called me that I was not really happy and all they said was sorry so I feel a little duped that I spent $15k and don’t feel any better about my hair than I did before.  Would def not recommend.

Then they respond and tell me to email them because they want to ensure patients are happy.  I sent them an email over 6 weeks ago and not a call or response from Bosley at all.  So 2100 graphs, $13000, and 18 months later, this is what you end up with.</Text>< username>

<review>DO NOT PROCEED!  A long story short: I met with Dr.Suddleson at the Beverley Hills office. I told him I wasn’t a rich man and would be taking out a loan for this. I couldn’t have ongoing expenses. I was promised the results that I needed for 10k. Specifically no more bald spot. I had the first procedure without success. Then a second procedure still not successful. I came back for a third surgery and was told Dr. Suddleson was now retired. They refused to honor the agreement saying I would have to pay another 6k to complete the job. Keep in mind I wasn’t completely bald. Just needing crown and bald spot work. Bosley needs to take care of me. Do you think they’ll use my experience in one of there commercials...not a chance. I wish I could add a photo here.

UPDATE May 24, 2021: I notice the pictures I posted are no longer visible. Bosley continues to loose money as clients make the right choice and go with a different to company.<//review><resp>{'time': 1619611789227, 'text': 'We’d like to hear more about your experience.

<Text>I was very satisfied, and every thing was handled great. These are a few very minor points that would have elevated the experience up a small notch, but I would loved to have had a snack option of fresh fruit. Also, would like to have had some sort of hat, disposable or otherwise, to be sent home with. I appreciated everything done for me. It was a very pleasing experience.</Text>< pics>

Lesly, Mike, Archie, Greg, the Doc and I wish I could remember everyone’s name on the team because everyone was amazing. Thoughtful, attentive, and intuitive; if I wanted to be quiet they read my mood and gave me peace... or if I wanted to obnoxiously ask every question imaginable they chatted with me while I peppered them with questions. Most importantly, the team seemed to love their jobs and I saw a real willingness to work together as team and put the patient first.  I showed up angry and irritated that my Covid test results didn’t come back in time and I was going to have to reschedule. I worked with Greg who set me up with a rapid test down the street and we got to work after that. Incredibly accommodating.< /review>

I just completed my second FUT procedure at Bosley yesterday.  Both of which were carried out by the real world-class master Dr. Deutsch and I cannot say how happy I am with the results.  I am ecstatic in fact.

My battle with baldness began in my 30s.  Considerable hair loss in front area with my hairline disappearing.  So I had my first operation by dear Dr. Deutsch in 2007 who completely reconstructed a very natural and beautiful hairline for me.

Ten years later I desired more hair density in the same area of my head and I was talked into traveling to Turkey by a family member who told me that the work in that country was good and the price very inexpensive.  The clinic in Turkey where I did my second procedure had all the great reviews and the price was very reasonable.  1800€ For 1300 grafts.  So I went ahead with it and boy did I regret doing so afterwards.

The Dr. in Turkey utterly destroyed my beautiful hairline and completely didn't do what I had asked him for.  They put hairs in places that I hadn't asked them to and didn't put hairs in areas that I wanted it in.  A complete mess.  What was even more annoying was that I noticed their mistakes immediately a day after the operation when I was going through recovery.  HELL!  A nightmare.  My hair looked worse than prior to the first time I had had the operation

So I returned to Bosley and Dr Deutsch did a really wonderful job and I cannot convey how happy I am today.  Not only that but he also did an additional 400 grafts for me absolutely free.  What a result.

I come from a family of four generations in hair and beauty business internationally.  I work between Europe and US and thus come across many people who deal with hair in general.

By far Bosley is the best in the world.  You may be able to get your hair restored cheaper elsewhere but DO NOT waste you money and time.

With Bosley not only you receive the best service but also most importantly you receive the artistry which is second to none.  The results are natural and crucially complimentary to the shape of your face rather than a generic method made the same for everyone.

Their team were putting effort into each individual graft.  Placing them so that they would have the most beautiful impact.  Other places can grow hair for you but they plant them randomly like a messy garden but Dr. Deutsch and team I would compare to landscape gardeners who know where each individual graft must go.

In short I don't think there is anything better to spend your money on than to get your hair back.  We buy many precious things in life but nice hair is something that we can enjoy every single day of our lives and we literally take it to the grave with us so why take a chance when you can have the most advance technology and expertise at Bosley.

All the other staff who were working on me at time of my procedure were totally dedicated to me, extremely helpful and caring.

Thank you Dr. Deutsch, thank Bosley and the staff.  I hope you go from strength to strength.

<review>I was assisted with the information pad with correcting items and signing the information pad. I had to wait 1 hour & 10 minutes after my scheduled appointment time before an associate talked to me. I felt like the presentation was rushed even though I waited about 7-8 minutes for the doctor to appear. The doctor did answer all my questions before leaving then the associate gave me the doctors exam sheet & told me he would email me the costs & info rather than answer questions at that time<//review><user_id>103851349812277982019< /user_id>< Rating>

This was one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made however, I decided I wanted to do something for me so I did it. I went to the Bosley location in Beverly Hills and can not stress enough how professional the entire staff was. This situation was a high anxiety one for me as it is dealing with a touchy subject (its not like we discuss hair loss with our friends) and I felt embarrassed about why I was there in the first place. This team quickly turned my embarrassment and anxiety into relief and calmness.

Now Ill address the most important question you might be asking. Is it expensive?  Well the answer to that is absolutely it is expensive but you are talking about your hair!! Why would you not give yourself the best possible care in regards to something that is going to be with you the rest of your life. You buy a car finance it for 5 years and then its time for a new one. You buy a couple thousand grafts finance them for a few years and you will still have them! If you are shopping for the cheapest price then hair restoration is probably not for you. If you want the best possible procedure without leaving the country to have it done then look no further. I'm confident about my results even though it will be a full year before I see them this was explained to me from the very beginning. Bosely's team did not try selling me pipped dreams. They were very upfront with everything. That says a lot about their integrity and that was all I needed in order to agree to let them fix this problem I have been having for so long.

I waited 2 weeks to specifically meet with Dr. Duetsch and drove over 400 miles one way just to find out he's not even in the office. We waited over 40 minutes or so to visit with the counselor, ended seeing another doctor. The total experience to me felt like I was at a car dealership versus a physician's office.<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>From the moment I walked in Bosley, I felt safe. I absolutely loved my doctor and his PA's. They were so accommodating during the 8 hour procedure for my bathroom breaks and work text messages. I was very grateful to have a team that had my best interest at hand, and the doctors call that night was the added details to my experience. Finally, I was completely taken back that I barely felt a thing, and I hate needles. I also loved listening to my favorite music too. If anyone is nervous about making this life changing decision, I can tell you that you won't be disappointed at all. Enjoy</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Quite a few things could have been done better. The strip extraction was not the best. Dr Deutch did not do a foolproof job with suturing. Some hair grafts are now resulting in curly hair. Some hairline is not covered as well as it could have been.

Highly recommend Bosley Beverly Hills.
It works. Dr. Deutsch is the consummate professional.
It took me three total treatments to reach fullness.
But, it worked! Some might need less....< /text>

<Text>QUICK NOTE ALLAN PARUNGAO below is an affiliated physician who wrote a 5 star for this facility (aren't doctors taught to be honest). One of the most unprofessional group of people I have encountered. They did a terrible procedure requiring repair at another more competent physician. I do not recommend. In addition, the cost estimate is lower than the day of your procedure. They do not allow you to meet the surgery until the day of your procedure. The worst part is that he will only be present for the beginning and then leave you in the hands of techs. Thats not good practice. Please do not waste my time with please contact our patient care email. They ignore the emails and post these responses in order to appear like they care. A few of the 5 stars are employees there and are easily recognizable. Pathetic you need to lie to scam customers.</Text><username>Anthony S</username><Time>1596788667931<//Time></record>

Have absolutely no regard for the customer satisfaction. There is no guarantee and if you are unhappy, they want to charge you more. I highly recommend researching this company. Google “complaints for Bosley Medical”  there is a separate website dedicated to their malpractice of having to not regrow hair properly. Patches of hair more like. There are better companies my colleague researched, and had a procedure done. Not with Bosley and it looks amazing, but if you want to waste money , I recommend this company. Happy to share photos. I wonder since they never rectified their problem, how much I have costed them by telling my friends in my industry to go somewhere else. I think 10x over what I paid so far.<//Review>

Had a 5pm appointment. Arrived at 5:09pm and no one was even there. Didn't receive a phone call asking if I was running late, either.  Had to come from across town and this is LA traffic at rush hour.  Google maps said open till 6pm, too. Very odd business practices. Don't schedule end of day.< /Review>

<Review>When I arrived for surgery and walked back to my room on 1/31/2020, I rounded the corner and saw a corner surgery room with windows and a great view! Beautiful! As I came to my little room with one general window I asked the MA there if I could be operated on in the other room (as this is a 6 hour ordeal). She rudely responded, "No! These are prebooked and this is what you get!" She was quite stern and irritated that I nonchalantly asked. I didn't respond to her rudeness and remained quiet. 5 min later she apologized for her comment and said that she hoped this room was ok and explained why the other room wasn't available. But right from the beginning, she had a grouchy attitude with me and was stand-offish through the remainder of the day with me. The doctor then came in to confirm my purchase and said, "I see we're doing 1,000 grafts..." I said, "No, I'm supposed to have 1100." He said, "Oh well we need to change your plan because that's extra." So we argued briefly and he then said that yes it's 1100 but it's 100 free, but if I want more we have to charge more. Anyway, the surgeon was argumentative with me when all I was trying to do was confirm the 1100 that I was supposed to have. I reminded him that I did not appreciate being nickel and dimed prior to being operated on and he quipped back, "Look man, I'm just on salary, I don't really care how many you get or not it doesn't affect me at all, we just have to have this figured out on paper." This was so annoying and unprofessional compared to previous Bosley experiences. This interaction affected our rapport for the remainder of the procedure and I felt very uncomfortable even being operated on by him or his grouchy MA. The lunch selections weren't that great and neither was the grilled cheese sandwich I ordered. It was mostly melted kraft American cheese with tomatoes. Very mediocre. Also, the vibe in the room made me feel like it was a burden to staff when I asked for more snacks or drinks; if would often take a long time to get more water or a drink. Then, as the snack wrappers would pile up on my tray next to me, no one ever removed them for me or offered to do so. I got up 4 times to empty my own trash off my tray while i was in the surgery process and, upon leaving picked up the rest; literally no service. Upon leaving, I was medicated from the anesthesia and no one reminded me to gather my things from the coat closet; no one brought me my shirts/coats from the closet in the room.  I had to come back to the office to retrieve them an hour later while staff was cleaning the room and my stuff was still piled in the closet; no one checked up on me as I left to see that I had my things. I was disoriented, to some degree, from being in surgery for 6 hours!  I gave my number to the nurse, he asked for it, so the doctor could call me that evening to see how the surgery went. It's now Sunday, two days later and no call or check in from anyone at Bosley. I said to the surgeon I'd like to come in to have my hair washed on Monday since Bosley is closed on Saturday's and he agreed/approved of this. I was suppose to get scheduled on my way out for a Monday follow up visit and hair wash but I was never stopped or asked by anyone at any point to schedule my appointment to come back on Monday to have a quick check up or hair wash. Also, with the 1100 grafts I received, typically the surgeon will have extra grafts left over after they remove the doner area of the scalp. Not only did this surgeon not do that, I overheard the MA's saying to themselves that they had to ask the surgeon to come back to take out more donor area just to reach the 1100. They are so cheap at Bosley Beverly HIlls, totally nickel and diming me, the surgeon didn't even get enough doner area to begin with lol. Once more donor area was taken, I was told they had just barely harvested exactly 1100 grafts to be transplanted. I believe this is a lie! How would that be? Why not 1106, or 1115, or 1097? So I apparently got what I paid for but they didn't even give me one additional graft over the 1100.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< user>

I was worried about a high pressure sales pitch.  Instead I got a courteous, professional team that helped me make a decision that restored some self esteem and made me feel more confident.  I appreciated the quiet competence and care that the surgeon displayed.  All in all it was a great decision.<//Review>

If you're reading this, that means you are considering a procedure.
Let me start by saying that I researched every facility, doctor, had many meetings and consultations, and could not make up my mind.
Some of the doctors I liked, I would have had to sell a kidney in order to afford them. More hair, one less body part :)
Then I came to Bosley. The rep I met with, who is no longer there, was awesome, not pushy at all. Then the doctor came in, and I was sold!
Dr. Deutsch was spot on. Optimistic, yet realistic. It also didn't hurt that I had seen him on TV numerous times. Who better to do my hair than the guy who's done thousands of procedures.
2 years later, I just had a second procedure. Shout out to Gregg, their reigonal sales manager. The results from the 1st were  amazing and not a single person who knew me realized I had my hair done unless I told them.
The only thing that kept happening is my friends telling me that I looked really good, but could not figure out what had changed.
Lastly, their pricing is middle of the road, and in my opinion, extremely fair.<//text>

Please compliment and thank Michele Huynh, Cindy, Nefri, Arche, Vicky, Luz and Yromarh for the excellent support and dedicated care they gave to me during the operation.  Luz, in particular, mentioned how they always strive to adhere to Dr. Bosley's high Customer Service standards plaque in each operating room.  Cindy was great.  She was refreshing, personable, friendly and concerned.  Nefri watched out for me during the Fire Alarm Evacuation even more than for herself.  The entire medical support crew is most impressive.< /Review>

5 stars all the way starting with my counselor Steve Guri. He knows his stuff with years of experience and I was completely confident in everything he said with regard to what I could expect and what my expectations were.
The surgeon Dr. Suddleston and his staff performed the surgery a few days later and they are simply the best in the business.
I highly recommend Bosley!<//Text>

At first I was worried about spending that much money for hair. By the time I left I was kicking myself that I didn't do it sooner. Steve was more than pro getting all my questions answered and working around my schedule and Dr. Deutsch was outstanding. The whole team and the experience were top notch. Not one negative thing to say. Thank you guys. The day after my surgery my brother called Steve and scheduled with Dr. Deutsch also. These guys get results.<//Review>

<review>It is almost 3 weeks since my 2nd procedure with Dr. Deutsch. This time I had a FUE (Follicular Unit Excision---one by one follicular harvest). This was such an easy process. Pain is subjective, but this was an easy process for me. No sutures and I only took Ibuprofen once. The donor area healed quickly and Dr. Deutsch lowered the receding corners of my hairline. I still have my widow's peak and a natural hairline. I also had Scalp Micro-pigmentation to my old scar. My scar was small but this added pigment will keep it hidden and allow me to cut my hair short. Thank you Dr. Deutsch, Michelle-PA, Michael-ST, and Desiree-MA. You are all amazing and I cannot wait to see my results.
Thank you!<//review><time>1543877400126< /time>< Pictures>

I ran out shaking after spending 20 minutes with the highly combative photographer telling me I don't meet the doctor until the day of the surgery. And you're mad I find that alarming? You can't shame and violate people like that. You cannot legally hold onto the photos you took of me with no choice and it's against HIPAA to share photos without permission and you do NOT have my permission. I have reported your cruel, abusive photographer and lack of medical oversight to the Medical Board of California. Now delete my pics.</Review>

This weekend I shaved my head (as other members of my family) in support of my sister who has cancer and is going through chemotherapy. Much to my shock, I have a frankenstein-like scar the entire width of the back of my head. Absolutely embarrassing. Looks like a butcher cut my skull. Now I'm scrambling to seek help for this debacle.</Review>

As a salesman, I am very good at spotting a sales pitch. I did not get that here. They even told me honestly that I was not the ideal candidate for transplant and they offered a free prescription for Finasteride. I not only left with a free prescription, but I went away with a lot of information. If you are at all worried about hair loss, you should start here.<//review>

My entire experience with Bosley was amazing.  For reference, I did the FUE procedure, 2433 grafts but who’s counting?  My story:

I’ve had thinning hair since the end of high school... I remember a friend joking I should go to Bosley when I wasn’t even out of college.  I know how it feels to see terrible thinning in every photo - it sucks.

About 6 months ago I decided to look into finally doing hair restoration.  I started by going to Ziering.  I left unimpressed by the entire experience.

Cut to December 2017... I received a gift card offer from Bosley and it reminded me I’d never gone to Bosley for a consultation (after what I saw at Ziering I saw no point).  Fortunately I had free time to kill so I thought, why not?

My appt was for January 2nd.  I met with Steve Costomiris who was amazing.  I immediately felt at ease and appreciated his dry sense of humor.  He took time to take photos of me and found past patients with similar balding patterns which personalized the experience.  I left feeling I wanted to do the procedure but still a little hesitant (mostly over cost but also a bit nervous about pain).

That night I emailed Steve and he immediately began working with me to address my concerns.  We agreed to talk the next day.

Next day rolls around - Steve had addressed all my concerns and told me there had been a cancelation for the following day.  I immediately booked it.

Cut to day 3 - I arrived early.  Steve greeted me and introduced me to Dr. Deutsch (also a great guy).  We went over the plan for the procedure, he answered my questions and it was off to the procedure room.

I met the team that would be working on me that day (and by day, I mean day... it’s a long procedure).  I will never forget Latoya who took the time to put me at ease and basically reassure me that everything would be ok.  We took care of initial setup, Michelle came in and numbed my head and we were off and running.

The initial shots were a little painful but they do their best to mitigate that with a massage device.  Once numb, however, I felt no pain at all.  They spent a few hours harvesting hairs, brought me a sandwich that was so delicious I’m probably driving back to Beverly Hills to eat at that deli again (Lazy Daisy, I believe).

After lunch it was time to plant the hairs - given the size of the job the next ~3-4 hours I was watching TV, chatting, and having the procedure continue.  They were so professional they could SEE the numbness was wearing off somehow and asked to make sure I was still comfortable.  Fortunately they did because I thought I could make it through but I definitely felt that re-numbing shots (moral of that story is don’t be a hero - ask for reinforcement of the numbing agent when you start to feel it or you’ll be sorry later).

Near the end of the procedure Steve popped in to check on it and see how it went.  Shared a few laughs and then they finalized the last hairs on my head.

Latoya went over how to care for the precious hairs - each one a fancy Starbucks drink (that’s how I look at it).  Dr. Deutsch showed me with a mirror what we were able to accomplish and then Latoya walked me out, implored me to call if I needed anything at all, and then — best of all — gave me a big hug goodbye.

All in all, I’m thrilled I finally did this.  I wish I’d done it sooner.  Based on the hairline I started with and what I want to end up with I may need a 2nd procedure next year.  I’m looking forward to it and seeing everybody again.

Do yourself a favor and don’t wait - at least get the consultation.</Review>

Fantastic group of people and veritably the best in class.  Big thanks to Steve Costomiris, Greg Sarkissian, and Dr. Deutsch for world class service. Relaxed consultation with none of the pressure as in lower end outfits, and full disclosures about the risks and rewards of different procedure options.   I went with FUE option- you can shave your head, do whatever you dang please, and there ain't any scar to hide. Time is about double normal procedure and price is a bit higher, but it's oh so worth it. This is an operation for sure, so don't mess around with generic brands and shady doctors- this is the way to go if you want this to work and care if you actually look good afterwards.  Very professional environment and great service, highly recommended!<//review>

The hours are a little tricky right now because of the pandemic I think but they're open on Saturdays. Plus you can call and make an appointment.

Came during a sidewalk sale and there were some really bargains on entry level guitars.  Lots of parts and plenty of weird stuff to check out. I bought a capo and the price was good.< /review>< Pics>

Will definitely come back! Made an appointment and got a new, nicer ukulele. They taught me how to change the strings and it was just generally a really good experience! Nice people, cool instruments.< /text>

<text>A true guitar lover's dream store. Funky, exciting and fun. Packed floor to ceiling with used inventory of guitars and amps of various makes and models with just the right amount of used broken-in character. This place is genuine and could never be duplicated.

<Text>Amazing shop. These are real pros.  I had the pleasure of going in there once time in person for a decent $500 purchase and would do business there if i lived in the area (or even passed through regularly). I used to look at the old webpage and drool. But then a few years ago i was looking for something in particular .. they used to have shipping containers full of stuff they would go through or so they claimed... so I called to ask for a callback if they ever came across something.  I felt very condescended to while staff member wrote my contact info in 'the big book', talking to me  like i was a 5year-old asking Santa for a rocketship. Nothing crazy or rare, just a specific mainstream model from the 60s. Three months later after no call back, the exact guitar i was asking about appears on the webpage and had been sold before I saw it.  oh well. i was ready to fly a cross the country to come pick it up, and haven't looked at the webpage since until today and was reminded of this.  love the shop, but will also feel forever miffed.</Text></record>

100% recommend this store. The owner is old school and way down to earth. Great guitars and very need posters on the ceiling and walls. Loved it here. One of the stickers outside the building.< /Review>

There's an amazing assortment of inexpensive and high end guitars. Rey replacement part I needed. They are known for their excellent repair services. Must be 2-3000 guitars here.<//Review>

<Text>Old school guitar shop. Kinda dingy, kinda dusty, kinda cool. Lots of guitars and some decent treasures. Prices are fair and the owner has a reputation for giving back to the community and local kids. They also have a 2 week return policy in case of buyers remorse. Seriously? What’s not to love?</Text><user_id>100002058989329567380<//user_id>< Response>

<Review>Amazing place!! Super cool friendly staff that will help you find the exact guitar you are looking for. They have so many beutiful electrics filed away in cases like a library. Awesome sg's from the 70's. Fair prices also. I will def be buying my next guitar here.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Go to Subway if you want to have a memorable and (if you'll relax a minute and enjoy the ride) fun experience buying a guitar from someone who gets guitars. It seems people prefer homogeneity over character these days, I think it's a shame. Subway is a great little community fixture. Unpretentious, laid-back, and they won't sell you things you don't need or that don't suit your needs. Go to Guitar Center if you want the box-store approach, or you want to be lied to or misled for the sake of them making a sale. Subway will buy back your guitar and there's a 2-week try-anything policy. Very cool.<//review>

<text>This is a fantastic old guitar store where you'll find great deals on unusual vintage guitars and amps as well as one-of-a-kind guitars and basses assembled from guitar manufacturers' overstock and salvage. I've bought a guitar, a ukulele and a bitchin Sunn guitar amp here and have been very happy with all the purchases and prices. The people who work there are very helpful in my experience but the owner Fat Dog is not. Cash or check only. 2 week return policy.< /text><gmap_id>0x80857ea344c3901b:0xf7dfc500db0c47f8</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I haven't been there in nearly 30 years as I live in Maine and don't get to CA anymore. However, I visited there once  and ordered a 9 string guitar! It was made from NOS parts and featured a Danelectro long horn body and Silvertone neck. It had a single coil in the neck position and a humbucker with coil splitting in the bridge. The extra strings were double course on the G, B, and E strings. I had it for a few years and finally traded it although I probably should have kept it. They did a good job assembling it; it just didn't sit very well in my lap. But if you want a cool one of a kind guitar, these guys can build it for you!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I enjoyed visiting this store.  Subway guitar has a wide variety of guitars.  They have a great buy, try, trade policy that lets you find the guitar that fits you.  They do not try to up-sale you.</Review>

Interesting shop, but their inventory is mostly busted up / Frankensteined guitars on the walls and literal piles of beautiful classics that are rotting away in forgotten cases. I went in looking for an older pre-60's Gibson and was given a lot of lip about, "Do you even have the money for this guitar?" It's a frustrating experience to see so many guitars that could use a good home sitting latent in a dusty pile while the owner brags about this only being a fraction of his collection and Lords his own mystique over you.

If you can see through the Berkeleyness of the shop, you can presumably conduct business in this shop, but expect to pay collector prices for unkempt dogs.</text>

A large selection of new and used guitars as well as amplification equipment are available here, supported by a staff who offer great customer service.  NOT the typical large-scale retail guitar/instrument shop, but rather a setting where you never know what potential stringed gem may be hiding in the nests of guitars suspended from the ceiling above the store.  Too bad the place does not have a little more space to play with the merchandise.< /review>

Too small to really try out a guitar, lots of loafers. Did not see any amazing vintage guitars, mostly beater guitars in terrible shape. As I was leaving, someone managed to pull themselves away from a very dismal conversation to ask me if I needed any help :)
Sorry, a major flunk.

One positive- I did notice a few nice vintage tube amps...</Review>

<review>A DUMPY guitar store which looks like it hasn't been vacuumed in 30 years and owners who don't know a thing about their inventory. We went in with money to spend on a cheap guitar but after digging through many guitars carelessly stacked in corners covered in dust and given attitude for no reason from the owner. They didn't have great prices considering how dirty their showroom was. Go to Broken Guitars or Starving Artists shop instead, Subway needs a complete overhaul< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I can't decide whether it's great or shocking or ?? that a place like this can still exist in the 21st century... from a business standpoint it's a mess (the guy who helped me didn't seem to know where anything was, not surprising given the chaos of their nonexistent filing system), and the ambience is definitely vintage stoner (the guy did take time to talk to me about what needed doing to the guitar, which was nice). I was a little dubious of whether they'd ever be able to find my guitar again, let alone perform the service needed within a reasonable time frame, but amazingly, he called me two days later and told me it was ready to pick up, and they did a good job for a very reasonable price, so clearly something's going right. They also let me take the guitar trusting that I would mail them a check because I didn't have enough cash (which was unnecessarily nice of them) and because they don't take credit cards (sweetly vs frustratingly (?) antiquated). I mailed them the check the same day, and it was cashed shortly thereafter, but they just called me to ask whether I had mailed them the check yet, so, again, see comments above re: the filing system. Not the usual bright shiny Customer Shopping Experience you get at more upmarket places, but definitely a breath of fresh air in its own grubby eccentric way ;) Recommend to anyone who dislikes shopping malls.<//Review>

<text>Owner is a total A HOLE! Super self absorbed. I play guitar for many well know blues artists around the county and every time I take anyone here or go there myself I am always left pissed because the guy is such a fool. You ask for a price on a guitar, he says i dont know what i want for it. Make me an offer, you make an offer and he literally wants %50 more than anyone on earth. 90% of the stuff in the store is in horrible condition and most things do not work and are missing lots of parts. Dust everywhere. Owner and employees really have no idea about any of the guitars. There are no amps in the store besides a few POS. This place is a waist of good honest american soil.

I think small shops with vintage old guitars of various qualities is GREAT... but when then shop has a holdback narcissistic [and/or grandiose] hippie running things, it ruins it.   Couldn't get a straight answer on price on 3 items, and he wouldn't even open a case to see what a blue guitar pedal was under some things.  Just wanted to sell a reissued overdrive pedal for 3x what it was worth.  I was pleasant the either time, engaged in chatter, and that was the way I was treated the entire time there.  Not heading back.  Maybe if this was a free admission guitar museum I would rate it higher, but as a guitar store it was a withholding experience.  Stay away until store's attitude changes.< /review>

I talked on the phone with fatdog from North Carolina. We agreed to meet at the shop on Tuesday.

So, I spent a total of 80 bucks to just get out there and back.  Not counting the cross country flight, hotel ,etc.

Fatdog said he had many options for me due to bone cancer in my right arm. 5 SGs to be specific.

Fatdog was not only not there but the guy working there couldn't get him on the phone and knew nothing about the inventory.

I found one worthless SG.

Most of what I saw were pieces of crap.

Too bad because musical instruments should be fun, amazing......etc. I don't need mint.

Sorry, I can't stand those who show no respect to cancer patients with limited time in this beautiful are.

Spend your hard earned money elsewhere.</Text>

What a wonderful encoraging experience - the best I've had in the last 5 years! Going to Fat Dawgs was a journey to give my grandgurl (girl urging real living) authentic experiences. This goes to the top of the list for her!  Also, I've decided to learn to play the 38 inch guitar I bought for her when she was born and as I turned 60 on 7/27. Bailey is just 6 months old and curious. We parked and Fat Dawg along with Maestro and Bake pulled in behind us! It was a reunion for Fatty and Matt(our neighbor friend) whom brought us to this gift of an experience.  The men were very welcoming to us and Fatty invited us into Subway providing chairs and warmth.  We met 20 y.o. Jon Paul (an accomplished guitarist-whom I hugged when I learned he spent time near Cleveland-my hometown) and his grandmother, Margo (an Anthropologist)-both of whom were engaging with beYOUtiful Bailey. Maestro played a Ukele and Bake picked up a Mandolin.  Maestro instructed me to breathe as I just belted out "Amazing Grace"!We all shared about ourselves-Maestro has 10 grands and I'm a communitarian.  As I connected with Ethan for guitar lessons my little Bailey was creening her neck looking at the ceiling so I thanked her for reminding Grammie to look towards the heavens--Fat Dawg shared that the pics/posters were of his favorite people.  Others entered the shop and were warmly welcomed as well.  Look at the ceiling to see if B B are there!  Beverly and Bailey! See me at the recital as I'll be playing and if I perfect the breathing..."Let it be me!" Guess to whom I shall sing it!<//text>

The pizza here is really good. Family and I have been getting pizza here since I was a little kid. Got really annoyed when I was trying to take an order and the guy behind the counter was actively looking at his phone at the exact same time.< /review>

<review>I dont know what the deal was with these people, on two (2) separate occasions I came in about fifteen (15) to twenty (20)  minutes before they were set to close, not busy at all to make a simple pepperoni pizza since they were all standing around joking with one another. Well these lazy employees couldn't make me a simple pizza because they were "closed". If you're closed, lock the doors and turn off your sign and advertise that you close earlier than you're supposed to. Definitely will not be coming here again.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<review>They are so Fantastic and they will happily make substitutions for you if they are able to. My Favorite is the "Chicken-Bacon-Artichoke Delite"...Sometimes I have it thin crust and other times California crust! Either way it's Great and the ingredients are fresh and prepped daily. I Love Baking my own Pizza, because then I know exactly how it will turn out!!! I Love My Papa Murphy!!!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Very simple place, stopped there for a bit during a bus journey back to LA. Has a small convenience store and a restaurant. But the view is very nice. A nice place to just sit and relax for a bit.</Text>

Loved this place, stopped here frequently, great Mexican food, but they are now closed, signs are gone, and the lights are off.
The business certainly has been lower with the virus, less travel, and they got a lot of business as a Greyhound stop, but there aren't many passengers anymore, so I understand why they might have had to shut down.
Hopefully they will be able to reopen at some point.</Text>

Solid truck stop. All the stuff you need and a whole lotta pumps. The location was clean including the bathrooms. The line was long but the service was super fast. I don't drive diesel but this place had a on of diesel pumps if you need that. The prices are reasonable. I was happy with this spot.</review>

Great parking spot for the night. Lots of spaces, the food inside was great, they were a little busy but that's to be expected to at a gas station in the middle of nowhere. Prices are good, nice and dark and quiet at nice. Fill definitely be stopping here again. Great work staff.<//review>

Truck stop area. Gas station with a convenience store for your restroom breaks and refills of your drinks and snacks for the road. They also have eating area where you can order sandwiches from Subways, pizza from little Ceasar. Good size parking lot. Three stars  because it was crowded,  and dirty bathrooms.</text>

<text>They charged me $95 to fill half a gas tank. The pump never gave a receipt so I didn’t double check while I was there. I get home and I see my bank statement. I’m thinking someone ripped me off because I left my car fill up while I used the restrooms. Could someone have used my pump to fill up their gas tank?  Be careful. They also charged higher for gas than any other gas station. I’m so upset.  I’ll never stop there again. $95 for gas is way too much.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>What a great pit stop on. I-5 in Avenal Cali. We where able to sit outside on a late february day and enjoy a chorizo, egg and potato burrito the size of my forearm that was out of this world. A couple homemade asada tacos and a cold mandarin jarritos. Service was quick and very pleasant. I seldom leave anywhere saying I'm full but i rolled out of this joint. Life is good!!<//review>< pics>

I travel 600 miles at a time on greyhound to go back home from college at least 6 times a year and I always look forward to this stop, it means happiness to me! Has a couple restaurants inside, toilets, and a convenience store. I simply LOVE this place as a greyhound bus traveller lol< /text>

Fantastic stop! I found ample parking at 8PM on a Friday. They have  Little Caesars, Subway and a Mexican style eatery.< /Text>

<review>The staff was very friendly. Gas is extremely overpriced. Approximately $1.20 more per gallon than the next stop on the day we went. The bathroom had many items in need of repair and was in need of cleaning. Will keep in mind to wait for the next stop next time we are traveling I-5.<//review>< pics>

What a great pit stop on. I-5 in Avenal Cali. We where able to sit outside on a late february day and enjoy a chorizo, egg and potato burrito the size of my forearm that was out of this world. A couple homemade asada tacos and a cold mandarin jarritos. Service was quick and very pleasant. I seldom leave anywhere saying I'm full but i rolled out of this joint. Life is good!!<//review>

Pretty good store. Restrooms were a little dilapidated, but clean. The Subway takes the "Eat Fresh" slogan seriously. And, they can make anything - they even have garlic. It's a place I won't have to avoid. And, even though it's kind of in the middle of nowhere, I can still do a 34-hour reset here.< /text>

Typical gas station. Bathrooms could have been cleaner. Gas was overpriced but you have to pay for the convenience of right off the freeway. The staff were a mix of nice and courteous to downright snippy and rude. Overall, if we pass through this area again, we'll skip over and hit up the next stop.< /text>

The only thing missing is a little more shopping for the truckers expediency.  Such as lights, tire guages, gloves, etc.  I personally have never seen one with massage, at least until now.< /Review>

<text>Very friendly staff. They have a subway and a Mexican food place to eat at. They do have some showers for drivers. They have a scale here but isn't cat scale. But since I loaded close to here I had to use it. Scale works maze it home without getting pulled it to major scales. Seemed like a very busy place.</text>< pictures>

Ok, just for gas the place is okay, but pricey. Clean, new pumps and the outdoor area has nice grass with shade and a few picnic tables. The bathrooms are very poorly maintained and they leave the doors open to dissipate the smell. The store is okay, but undermanned and the line gets long. The attached Subway is okay, but really, after all I have said before, do you want to try it?< /review>

Service was very slow inside. Just another reason why I do not like going to 76. When I was in Southern California I got skimmed at the pump on the gas station. My low expectations were met. I try avoiding 76 gas stations if it all possible. Unfortunately this time it wasn’t.<//review>

We stopped by here while traveling to LA by Greyhound bus. You can buy water bottles and other packed snacks here in limited variety. There is Subway to fill the stomoch. Restroom was clean. Little bit congested and  prices are not mentioned properly so one needs to check with cashier.</Text>

Busy little roadside gas station, but well-stocked with friendly employees. I stopped here after I needed some hardcore superglue after the wind on I-5 detached a piece of the plastic from my car, and they had a nice selection of emergency roadside supplies.<//review>

Sounds funny. . .but I LOVE THIS PLACE! I discovered this place when I began traveling via Greyhound Bus & it's AWESOME! They have an extended selection of all the usual snackie kinda stuff & in addition they have the BEST Chicken Tenders & Potato Wedges I've EVER had from a gas station. The staff night shift guyz are always so nice & if Ur wanting healthy. . .there's a Subway inside as well! Not too pricey either, so if U are in the area give'em a try.</Review>

This gas station saved my life, there's nothing passed here for miles and miles, I suggest filling up here if you have less than half a tank. Otherwise the prices of the gas are usually high and its nothing special.< /text>

It's expensive.  If you can go another 20 miles, you'll get cheaper gas.< /text>

I pulled into the 76  gas station to fill my 20 tank (being I was on a long trip to get home) and when I opened my car door the music was blasting with repulsive OFFENSIVE lyrics, I first thought it was someone in their car, then I realized it was the station this music was loud and it was outside and inside the station, referring to black people as nigers and telling girls to suck his d*@% , I asked the person working their to shut it off because it is OFFENSIVE and DISRESPECTFUL to the female gender and to African-Americans , he refused saying the manager put it on that station and he had no way to get to the radio equipment. This is NOT the type of music/lyrics that should be piped out to the customers in a public business! My daughter and myself nor any child or female of any nationality should not have to be subjected to such rude disrespectful offensive lyrics. I did NOT feel safe at all at this 76 station because of the atmosphere these lyrics put over the place! After finding no manager and being treated rudely by the cashier, we left! I WILL NO LONGER BE GIVING MY BUSINESS TO 76 Service Stations!< /Text>
