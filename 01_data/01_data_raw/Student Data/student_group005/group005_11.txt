Our Explorer needed some major work done on its right rear after an accident with the curb.  Had the car towed to Fox and they let me know of its arrival.  Within a day a detailed list of what was needed was sent to me along with pics.  We needed a few days to decide if it was worth repairing such an old car and Fox did not pressure us to make a decision. I think it took five days for us to finally decide to go ahead with most of the recommended the repairs.  Fox Auto team took care of it and finished it ahead of schedule.  We've been taking our cars to Fox for years and trust them to repair our cars right.
Thanks Fox Auto.<//Text>

The service at Fox is second to none, as is their insistence on doing what is right for the customer. In the years we've been with them, they have talked us out of expensive repairs as they were not in our best interests. We know that what they recommend is absolutely necessary and that we won't be overcharged. And they do it all with a smile and sense of humor!</review>

Perfect service on every level and approximately $800, less than the dealer. The receptionist is extremely attentive and prompt in responding to questions. AAA approves business. I will be a continued  customer for all major work, as they replaced the alternator, battery and few less major items on my Lexus.<//text>

< Review>
I had my 2005 mustang GT towed in because the master cylinder on my clutch broke while I was driving, my repair was supposed to be done next day, which is impressive, they had it installed but the part they put in happened to be faulty, which they noticed when testing everything. I cant fault them for taking an extra day to make sure my car works properly, when they still had better timing than other shops with the delay included. These guys are great< /Review>

I love Fox Auto Care! I had a busted Water Pump & they fixed it within a day. They send you a text message when your car is ready and a whole detailed report inspection of your car. Pictures and information is included in the inspection report. The staff is super friendly and everyone who works there seem to be very helpful. I have dubbed this place my go-to mechanic and they know it! Thank you Fox Auto!! Your Friend, Jane<//Text>

Fantastic treatment of their customers! Super friendly. Went above and beyond to set me up with a rental car while mine was being worked on. A great family-owned, but professional-grade company that definitely surpassed all expectations, given my prior interactions with auto repair companies. This is actually my first time giving ANY company an online rating. Highly recommend!< /Text>

I have been taking my car to this mechanic for years. They are quick, transparent, and friendly. They always go above and beyond to find the best deal and to be upfront about everything.

I am writing a review after all these years because I have been looking for a vehicle for a family member. They have provided pre-purchase inspections for the vehicles I find. One vehicle in particular had a litany of problems which they noticed within ten minutes of starting the inspection. They didn't even charge me for the inspection. The people at Fox Auto Care have great integrity and are knowledgeable in what they do!< /Text>

Hello Paribus< /Name>
<date>1578956199218< /date>< rate>

<Text>As a first year member of AAA Plus, I was surprised to receive a coupon for a "free 40-point inspection". I chose this vendor because the reviews were great. The facility is clean, you even get a photoreport on your phone. BUT

The guys suggested me a maintenance for almost $2000 for my VW Jetta 😱 which I didn't need.

1) They suggested to replace rotors, a caliper, and pads for $900. When I started asking questions I realized that only front pads need to be replaced. My caliper is in a perfect shape and requires a slight lubrication. My rotors are in a perfect shape as well (VW suggests to replace them at 19mm, but I'm having 21.8 mm now). How did I know that? I doublechecked the brakes myself.

2) According to the maintenance spech, I supposed to change a timing belt and a water pump, but that could be done at a 100,000 miles. Anyway, even VW dillership agreed to change for this labour way cheaper.

Conclusion? Thank you, Fox Auto Care, for trying to rip me off. I found another store with honest guys that triple checked my breaks for free. They confirmed that the rotors are fine, and my caliper needs lubrication and pads need to be changed. They gave me a reasonable price for their service.

When I asked why they didn't charge me for inspection, which took 15 minutes, they said they are for a long run in the automotive business. After those words and honest approach, I want to support their business and will take my car there for as long as I'm living in this area.<//Text>< Pics>

Especially since you came in for free inspection at which time we were able to bring these things to your attention I think the word you're looking for are thank you.  We at Fox auto care don't ever and would never try to rip somebody off I think it's unfair for you to say that however everybody's entitled to their opinion. We wish you All the best and just know we are here if you ever need us. I we are sad that you left feeling we didn't do right by you. Good luck and take care"}< /Response>

<review>So I brought my car in on a tow truck after it overheated and was greeted by Lisa the manager, who walked me thru every step and made me feel comfortable with leaving my car at a very stressful time. Even tho its an extremely busy shop she still managed to make me feel like a priority, and even provided me with a rental car at no cost so I could still get to work!  Once the car was inspected she found the time to call me and go over all costs with NO SURPRISES!!! Now im back on the road!! Thank you Lisa for all your help! You and your shop definitely deserve more than 5 stars!!</review><date>1565117543793</date>< Name>

<Review>Today I had my car serviced at Fox. I made the appointment online and they responded quickly to verify my appointment day and time. I made arrangements in advance to get a ride to work, and Jacki ordered Lyft for me, which was very efficient!

I wasn't sure exactly what work my car would need, so Jacki communicated with me throughout the day to update me and ask how I wanted to proceed. She also advised me as to what they thought I needed done, and what they thought could wait. They took pictures of the parts they thought needed work, and sent me a link to a site that listed everything they reviewed and what the results were. Super convenient!

When my car was ready a Lyft driver was sent to pick me up, and the final bill was exactly what I was quoted. Very pleasant, super efficient and professional. So glad a co-worker referred me to Fox! I'm a lifer!  Thank you!<//Review>< time>

I have been going to this place for all my car repair needs and regular oil changes for 5 years now. Most importantly they are honest and guide you about what needs to be done urgently and what can take time. They never try to make money. Plus they are AAA approved shop and I never had any problem with them or the repair. I trust them 100%.< /Review>

OK, this was the hardest 5 star rating I've ever given,  Not because they don't deserve it, but I really don't want everyone to discover these guys and make it impossible to get my trucks serviced on short notice.  Truth be known, I love these guys and trust them with all my vehicles so (said extremely begrudgedly) stop by.  You will love them too.</Review>

< Review>
These people are the best! Went there to get a second opinion after a mechanic told me it was going to be $3k to fix my car. Took it to Ken Fox, they said the other place was wrong and fixed my car out the door for under $500! They are personable, take great care of your car, and are transparent in their pricing. They're stuck with me forever now.<//Review>

I'm always very skeptical of repair shops, however, the customer service and honestness here was great. They were very friendly and nice, told me the issue, and I never felt pressured into beginning the service even though I declined. I will be coming back to them for any auto issues in the future.</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very good service.
My pickup truck broke down on the road. The trailer driver said it might be a problem with the gearbox. It is estimated to be at least a few thousand dollars. Fox's Jackie patiently listened to me describing the fault condition in stuttered English, then let me not worry, they first Check it out, I was very embarrassed when I handed the car keys to them. When I got the car the next day, Jacki told me that the throttle line was just around, and I didn’t spend any time, so I didn’t charge me. cost.
I really couldn't believe it. I said to buy some gifts for her. She also refused to accept it.
I will go to Fox Auto Care after repairing the car.
The question now is how do I change the previous 4 stars to 5?

(Original)
非常好的服务。
我的皮卡车在路上抛锚了，拖车司机说可能是变速箱的问题，估计至少得几千美金，Fox 的Jackie耐心地听我用结巴的英语描述了故障情况，然后让我别担心，他们先检查一下，把车钥匙交给他们的时候我心里还非常忐忑，第二天去取车的时候Jacki告诉我，只是油门线给绕上了，并没有花他们什么时间，所以也不收我的费用。
我当时真是不敢相信，我说给她买点礼物，她也坚决不收。
以后修车就去Fox Auto Care 了。
现在的问题是我怎么把以前的4星好评改成5 ⭐</Review>< username>

Is the best auto repair shop we have encountered.

I celebrated my graduation this evening in this gorgeous place. Well we had a astonishing evening and the place was definitely one of the reasons for that fruitful evening. The team  helped in a lovely way, the meals were appetizing and my buddies were extremely  happy. We shall no dout come back again for more joyful events. Thank you very much.<//review>

< Review>
this place opens after most of us are already at work and closes before most of us get home from work.. they close at 7pm and open at 9am.
Decided to give this location another try,  stood in line with other customers while both employees worked on internet orders 😡. I'll find another location for now on.< /Review>

I tried one of the new sandwiches they're introducing. I really enjoyed the garlic and steak with provolone. The sandwich was a bit on the small side but the flavor was outstanding. I recommend you try this one.</Review>

<Text>Very nice and clean place.  The service has always been friendly any of the numerous times I've taken my kids in here for a quick bite on a busy afternoon.  The location is also convenient - right in the northeast corner of the vons Plaza on Grand and Foothill.  There's also 20 minute parking spaces right in front.  It's definitely an inexpensive yet relatively healthy choice for my kids - I feel much better about bringing them here for a 'treat' rather than going to a fast food chain restaurant.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<text>Subway is the worst kind of sub shop their is. All the meats and cheeses are pre cut..small portions and then laid onto bread and topped off with veggies of your choice...dont make the mistake of accepting this as a sandwich...your just eating bread...you Jersey Mike's where they slice the meats and cheese right in front of you...that's my recommendation< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<userid>102690670154524235379</userid><response>None<//response><username>Isaac Robles<//username><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>I worked here. Management is innefective, forgetful, and generally treats their staff like garbage. The store manager herself, Tina, is slow at her job, unreasonable, racist and passive aggressive, and was only promoted because the store had gone without in store management since February and they were desperate to have someone take the position. The franchise has been inspected by the health department multiple times, and at the last review, they were one health code violation away from losing their A rating, and their title as a Subway store. There's no effective enforcement of many of the food safety rules (such as knife cleaning, it goes generally ignored and most of the staff simply spray them with a jet of hot water and go back to the counter), many of the sauces used are at least a day or two past their shelf life, and most people never check the temperatures of the food to make sure they're safe to eat. They also pay their staff below Los Angeles county minimum wage. I can't stop you from going to this god awful store, but at least think twice about it next time!
Also, their "Olive Oil" is 80% Canola Oil, and that's just gross.</Text><Rating>1< /Rating>< time>

<Review>Where do I begin? I go to subway at least 3 times a week. Inside been to many locations from Glendora all the way to Torrance and beyond. This little spot not only makes my sandwiches with a smile but they really take the time here to make your sandwich so that u love eating it.

The place is clean , never dirty and the counters are always sparking.

I have seen some locations that the rugs have lettuce and paper on them because they have not been swept and  because the employees are too lazy or not concerned with the image of the franchise.

This Glendora location is also the closest to me. Distance is not why I'm giving them a 5 star. It's simply their service and friendly vibe and the food never disappoints.

I have had some "So So" sandwiches in locations where the employees look like they don't care and don't like their job.

Randy specifically knows how our sandwiches are made to the exact order of the veggies and dressing order. It does make a difference when you add the vinegar and oil at a specific time and order.

So with all that said , I love this place. I could have had subway in Fontana today but I chose to wait until we arrived in Glendora to eat at the same franchise but at the better location.

You guys rock here in Glendora. Thank for always making us feel like subway is a home made sandwich when we come here!!<//Review><gmapID>0x80c32635d6d6d85b:0x5a3f443e24f21cd2</gmapID>< user_name>

It was great working with Century Glass. The process was very quick and smooth. They came, measured, and we scheduled for installation. Installation was swift and took about 4 hours. The shower enclosure looks great!< /Review>

Back in the day I purchased windows and patio doors, very professional and helpful, so different now, mr.

<Review>I recently had a new sliding glass door installed in my master bedroom. I'd like to thank Century Glass for the excellent  job they did. The installers were Freddy and Christian, and I really like the work they did. They were very professional  and meticulous,  paying attention to details. They cleaned as they went along, as well as after the job was finished. Everything was sealed very neatly, and the finished job was even more than what I had expected. I've used Century Glass on prior occasions, and have always been very pleased with the results. Ryan was the salesman for this particular door, and he explained all the features to me. He is knowledgeable and courteous. I'd highly recommend Century Glass.<//Review><rate>5< /rate>< pics>

I had a couple of issues with my windows i purchased, nothing to do with this company, and Juan helped me out with no hesitation.  He was professional, polite, and made my service so stress free.  I recommend this place for all your window and glass shopping.  Thank you Juan for treating customers 100%.  I will definitely be back in the future.<//text>

I had a fun and professional experience with Century Glass!!!! The installers were Daniel and Victor who both knew what they were doing while installing the replacement dual paned windows I ordered. I felt very much at ease with both gentlemen working inside of my home. Veronica was great to work with and kept me posted throughout the order. She responded quickly to all of my emails which is important to me. Ryan was  the estimator who came out to measure my windows. He was very nice and when a "hiccup" occurred with the size of one of the windows, he immediately took care of the issue. I would recommend Century Glass for anybody needing glass repairs in their home.</text>

It was easy to get an estimate that included all costs. They came on time and finished my windows fast. It was professional and didn’t break the bank</review>

From emailing Veronica to get a quote, then having Ryan come by to measure and order, all the way to installation, the entire process was quick and easy.  My glass had to be ordered, however  it was delivered and installed in the time quoted.  Awesome job!  Highly recommend Century Glass!  Thank you so much!< /review>

<Review>After seeing such good reviews I was extremely disappointed. The shower glass was not installed straight, excess glue on hinges and along the side. The brushed nickel pieces were installed crooked and I had to ask them to make it correct (which they did). Service reps were condescending and rude and I felt like I made a mistake going with this company. Would not recommend, even after talking with the owner who had a hard time understanding my complaints. 10 days from initial deposit to install even though I was told a week and I was in a rush to complete. They also charged my credit card before I had approved installation as explained by the office staff. Be careful and double check the installers work closely if you decide to go with this company.</Review><user_id>115335532926698452163< /user_id><name>Joe K<//name>< Date>

I went to Century Glass to purchase our glass door. Ryan and his office staff were quick and very personable.
As for the workers... they did not use a ladder to drill the top hinge holes so they went in at an upward angle and cracked the tile.  They never said anything, I just happened to see it 2 days later. Called Ryan who removed the door and worked with my tile guy to replace tiles.
Door was replaced 8 days later. Three days later I’m taking a shower and notice bronze hinges holding up our shower door had 3 bronze screws and one chrome one!
We paid well over $1000.00 for our glass door and they couldn’t go to Home Depot or look in the trucks ashtray to find the right screw!
Sorry Ryan... your a nice guy but I expect to get what I pay for in materials and workmanship.< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>If you are looking at reviews for replacing windows or slider doors your search is OVER!  I have experienced YEARS of good and bad customer service.  Century Glass far exceeded my families expectations beyond what we could hope for.  We had another company repair a window and got a quote for the whole house and a glass slider door.  It seemed high so i called Ryan at Century Glass to get a cost comparison.  They came out immediately and did the measurements and had a quote for us in just a few days.  The quote was FAR below the original quote from the other company for THE SAME WINDOWS!  They were knowledgeable and some of the best customer communication I have had.  Then comes the work.  They came in and did an immaculate job!  Their attention to detail and desire to please their customers is something for the record books.  Even when we had small snags (the aluminum frame stuck out beyond the vinyl frame of the new slider door) they recognized the problem and went to the store to get materials and did such a clean job you couldn't even tell there was an issue and it looks completely built in.  My only disappointment is that I don't have more windows for them to replace.  If you are looking for a window company that is honest, fair prices, excellent workmanship, pride in excellent customer service and outstanding communication...you can't find ANYONE that would come close to matching Century Glass!  Thank you Ryan and the rest of your team for helping me with making my house beautiful.</text>< Pictures>

I called in the morning regarding a broken window, they sent out an appraiser in the afternoon to measure and give an estimate, and the window and screen were installed the next day.

I had a large 3’x4’ old aluminum frame window break in dining room - so it was an emergency to get it fixed the same day.  Luckily Century was in the same neighborhood - the office dispatched the window tech and within one hour I had a new piece of of cleaned glass fully installed and mess cleaned up. Top-notch service!< /Review>

<Review>Recently purchased a home and I use to do the shower/curtain setup for a tub in my last house.  I called Century glass because I wanted an enclosure because my little boys always got the water past a shower curtain.  Ryan quoted me a price and it was well within reason so I accepted. I didn't have time to visit their store so I trusted Ryan with picking out the hardware.  The install was on time and fast. Great job on product, service, and install! My tile will actually survive in this house with no more water everywhere.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!! CALLED FOR A PRICE QUOTE ON A WINDOW REPLACEMENT DUE TO A HOME BURGLARY. I GAVE THE GUY THE MEASUREMENT OF THE WINDOW AND WAS QUOTED A REASONABLE PRICE. LOAD THE WINDOW UP HEADED DOWN TO BUSINESS AND WAS QUOTED A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRICE!! I SAID THATS NOT WHAT I QUOTED OVER THE PHONE. THE GUY THEN SAID THATS NOT WHAT I SAID!!! SO NOW IM BEING CALLED A LIER!!! I SAID NO THXS, LOADED MY WINDOW AND LEFT. ABOUT 45 MINS LATER THE OWNER OR MANAGER CALLED AND SAID THE CALL WAS RECORDED AND HE DID CLEARLY  QUOTE THE PRICE I WAS GIVEN! HIS ACTIONS WERE COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!! HE OFFERED TO MAKE IT RIGHT, I SAID I FOUND KERN GLASS AND WAS EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THERE QUOTE AND ESPECIALLY THE SERVICE. P.S. ITS NOT THE PRICE OF THE JOB, ITS HOW YOU TREAT THE CUSTOMER THAT PAYS FOR JOB!! I WILL BE SHARING MY OPINIONS WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS.<//review><UserId.>103282634967063351821<//UserId.>< user_name>

There was the one thing I'd thought might be a problem, but I DON'T RECOMMEND waiting as long as I did, even though it certainly wasn't done on purpose because I didn't want to be told "no" to placing an order for delivery. So, when I called there was hesitation whether or not to accept an order for delivery, and I'm unsure why it was accepted, but it was accepted anyhow which made me both happy and relieved.

I'd ordered 2 medium, 1 topping with one having onions (there wasn't going to be any kissing so onions were good lololol), and the other with black olives. Both pizzas were delicious as they usually and I couldn't have asked for anything better (except maybe free lololol). The delivery was faster than expected which was maybe 15 minutes from the time of the order. The pics speak better than a description. The one pizza missing a slice, well it's Dominos so what can you expect? lololololol 😍😉😄😀

If you find this review to be helpful, a LIKE (thumbs up) would be very much appreciated!!!

Went for a walk and tried to order the pizza with the app but it wasn't working. Had to wait till I got to the location and order it then. I just wished I could have ordered it online so it would be ready when I got there what's the point of an online app if it doesn't work? Passed a Papa John's and I was tempted to stop by and get pizza there. Maybe next time if I have problems again with the app.< /review>

Girl over the phone was rude. I asked if a certain pizza maker was working that day and she didn't even want to tell me...the girl I asked for makes the best pizza and that's why I only get pizza when she's making it!< /review>

<text>Don't let Benito deliver your food. He will not care if you ordered ranch. He will not care if you ordered a marinara sauce. What he will care about is not giving you your marinara sauce and not giving you your ranch. Benito please don't lie. I trusted you. I thought you were my go-to delivery man. Instead you are SAUCE liar. And a thief. For not only stealing my sauce, but also stealing my pizza filled heart.</text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

No point ordering curbside pick up. No one comes out to give you your Order even if you check in.  The only reason someone came out with my order was because one of the delivery guys came back from a delivery and noticed me waiting. For that I deducted stars.< /Text>

But what I really appreciate is the on-site manager. I had a carryout and the delivery guy took it by mistake. Not only she went above but also beyond to made it right.<//Review>< pics>

I been ordering from this Pizza place for quite some time but lately the guy who delivers my order has a problem and also has an attitude. Makes me feel uncomfortable. The only reason why I gave 3 stars is because they are usually on time.</text>

I accidentally ordered pizza for delivery instead of carry out and went to the store 2minutes after to let them know that I am picking it up, since they keep dropping my call. No coordination with the dispatcher and still proceeded with the delivery. Next thing I know, the delivery guy's outside the house with the pizza and we are still waiting for the pizza out of the oven at the store, that we already paid. I have to wait until everyone in line has been attended, instead of refunding what I paid because they already cause inconvenience since they messed it up. The pizza was already delivered at home. What kind of customer service is this? Crap!</text>

<Text>Worst place ever, took 2 hours to deliver my pizza and I was just a couple blocks away ridiculous really. And the pizza was horribly made. There was no cheese on it, it was just sauce and there were random ingredients on my pizzas like pineapple, sausage and olives when I just ordered pepperoni pizzas.< /Text>< Pictures>

Review was 50/50 and I was so~hungry, why not try here. I ordered spicy orange chicken and Jalapeño chicken. The moment, I tried spicy orange chicken taste strong herb sauce with greasy fat without any meat.  It was disgusting. Definitely, chicken with Jalapeno was better, but still I couldn't finish it. Exempt throw it in the trash can. Chickens are dry inside and soggy outside. I gave one 🌟 for lady has patience to explain four chicken dishes they have.</review>

<Review>I work next door to this place and i had a great experience prior to the young man helping me. Everyone else is nice respectful and gives you good service. The kid on the other hand, charges me 7.50 for beef n broccoli only of a box that i got chow mein and beef and broccoli for 5.75 just 2 days before. When i inform him of my previous experience he just quickly replies "we never do that here." I feel bad for the others who work there but they just lost a customer. That was ridiculous.< /Review>< username>

< Review>
I’ve never left a review for a restaurant before, but this was so awful I would feel guilty if I didn’t publicly warn people not to eat here.

Hands down the worst chinese food, potentially worst food I’ve ever had.  The chicken and beef didn’t even taste like meat.  Noodles and rice were a strange color and tasted even weirder.  Temperature felt like it was all microwaved.  I’m the type of person who will eat anything and I had to throw it away it was so bad.</Review>

The food here is always, just okay. It serves its purpose. One thing to be mindful of is that as it gets closer to closing time it's slim pickings. No fried rice, only noodles<//text>

Food was bland and looked like it had been sitting on the steam table too long. The spring rolls were bad. The chow mein was just okay. Fried rice was dry. The only thing good I had was the orange chicken, but that couldn't save this experience from being forgettable.<//Text><name>Benzeel</name>< Rate>

<Text>Barbecue chicken is good.<//Text></record></dataset><record>
<Review>This is clean the ladies there are very nice. We had the wonton soup which was delicious and we also had a bowl of chow mein with barbeque chicken and it was also very good. We loved it so much that we live in Hesperia and willing to go all the way to pomona just to eat there again.
Absolutely recommend this place.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

<text>Spotify urgently needs to prioritize the integration, by acquisition or partnership, of LAST.FM extensive catalogue of songs. So it becomes possible to click play on our libraries and 'loved tracks' list right there.
It is inexplicable that Last.fm hasn't put more effort into this deal. Despite that Spotify obviously doesn't hold the rights of all tracks listed on Last.fm, they should use the loved track data to add more content to its hideously limited catalogue. Also to shortlist what is available and what not on Spotify.
Also an automatic, uncomplicated, import/export tool of loved lists is desperately needed.< /text><time>1601723349884<//time><Resp>None< /Resp><Rate>1</Rate>< Gmap_id>

There is a public space in front of 235 2nd St. and in the lobby.  Free wifi is available.  If you accidentally walk into the break room (where outlets are available), you should probably restrain yourself from grabbing a free beer from the kegerator.< /text>

< Review>
Dr. Szeto is always very thorough and clearly explains any issues or concerns in detail.  Equipment and techniques are up to date and I personally appreciate that the network for any referrals needed/made have always been on point as well.  Samples for red eyes, dry eyes or even foggy lenses are at the ready for your individual needs with clear directions given on how you should use the product for best results.  Warning: The eyewear selection makes it hard not to want to update!  Appreciate that they work with the community to give back as well.

The office is modern and the equipment is always clean and sanitized.  Her staff goes beyond to assure your comfort as well and everyone is friendly, informative, knowledgeable and easy to work with.  My family members (four generations) and two friends referred have all felt the same!  They care that your glasses and/or contacts actually fit properly and work for you and your needs.  Real user, truthfully reviewed.<//Review>

Dr Szeto is friendly; listens to my questions and concern with patience, and answers them with helpful details.  She cares about her patient’s eye health and well-being.  I have had other optometrists before, but I stayed with only Dr Szeto for the last fifteen plus years.  She is great!< /text>

Thorough exam with attention to my specific needs and questions. Great selection of glasses, and more importantly, great help finding the best ones for me. Careful attention paid to fit and comfort as well appearance.  Friendly and helpful. Covid protocols all in place. What more could you ask for?</review>

Not only the best eye doctor in the world, but also one of the best, most caring doctors I've ever met. I"ve been a patient of Dr. Szeto's and her awesome and loyal team's for over 10 years now (15 even?), and the quality and continuity of care are unbeatable. Plus, a really beautiful selection of frames.< /text>

I’ve been going to Dr. Veda for 15+ years and she is so gentle and fast, which I appreciate greatly.  She discovered a retina issue that saved me from a much worse situation.   Dr. Veda is also so warm and caring.  I also adore her office staff - Bill is the best; Elizabeth is also wonderful.</Text>

Long time patient of Dr Veda SZETO. She and her staff are great. And, I always get compliments on my glasses. Office is kept super clean, selection is always kept updated. Bill Hurt is master on selecting frames, making adjustments. All are pleasant, helpful and have become friends over the years. Love them... which is why I continue to come over from Eastbay since I no longer work in SF.</Text>

I have been going to Dr. Szeto for almost 20 years, and wouldn't go to anyone else. She and her staff are wonderful. From day one, she made the effort to get to know me personally and always treats me with respect. She patiently explains any questions I may have. They also have a great selection of frames and are great at helping me pick out the right frame and the right kind of prescription for my needs. I highly recommend Dr. Szeto to anyone who has eyes!< /review>

<review>Best optometrist I've ever had.  Will not go anywhere else.

Proficient, honest, efficient, and takes the time and care to accurately check and diagnose problem(s) and will refer to other expertise in other fields if needed.  I've been coming here for years and will not go anywhere else.  Love Veda and Bill and always happy with the selection of frames and glass options I get.< /review>< pics>

The highest level of professionalism and service. Always friendly from the front counter to the examination room and beyond.

This experience was incredible I’ve never felt so comfortable in this specialty eye office and store. Felt so cared for, the staff is a A plus ! Was greeted with such warmth and sincerity. It was a Pleasure to meet Dr Veda she professional warm, kind and makes you feel so comfortable. My exam was so detailed she explained everything to me.  Before I came here I went to another office it felt rushed and short. Plus he gave me the wrong prescription for my lenses. I highly encourage anybody looking for an Eye Doctor to see  Dr Veda She Is Wonderful and so knowledgeable.
Thank you Billy & Elizabeth 😘😘😘<//text>

If you want to have a Doctor who takes your well-being at the utmost, it's Dr. Veda! I sustained an injury (fell off treadmill and banged left side of face/cheek/head) on a Saturday, sent Dr. Veda an email re: seeing floaters that evening. She immediately wrote back for an appointment on Sunday morning for dilation to assess the situation. When I arrived Sunday morning, she had her support team there to help as well. She performed a thorough exam and provided instructions and advice. I couldn't have asked for more. She's the BEST!<//Review>

< review>
My first annual exam at Dr Sveto's was the most positive experience I've ever had with in optometrist!

During the exam the optometrist took the time to explain what she was seeing in my eyes, how it was changing my vision, and what she recommended I get based on her findings. She patiently answered all my questions and didn't rush through any part of my appointment.

The office is also going to great lengths to ensure client safety during COVID-19 pandemic by thoroughly sanitizing surfaces between appointments and only seeing in one person at a time.<//review>

Be sure to ask Bill for frame recommendations--he knows how to fit glasses perfectly, and he's got great taste! I get compliments all the time on the frames he suggested for me.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I had an amazing experience working with Billy who helped me find a staple replacement sunglass that I needed for myself. I had the tragedy of losing a pair of Saint Laurent’s in a taxi cab, but I went in to Dr. Veda’s office and found all the luxury brands I could find and I am about to move my eye-care prescription over to this office as well. Definitely a vibrant team and in a cool niche area of downtown San Francisco. I highly recommend this practitioner and the team Veda has. Thank you so much to everyone there for keeping me luxury and can’t wait to take care of my eyes there!</text>

<review>Dr Szeto was very nice and friendly. I made an appt for the wrong day but thankfully she was able to see me. She gave me clear instructions on how to care for my eye and reassured me on what to do.

Super grateful for her help and ability to see me last minute. Office location was great as it is near the Bart exit and my office. Hoping to stop by again in the future to check out the eyewear selections!</review>< pics>

I’ve been coming her for +5 years and have loved it. The location is easy to get to and the service is great from the eye exam to purchasing glasses. I also like their trunk show they occasionally have with designer glasses. They offer a variety of glasses that are stylish and unique.</Review>

<review>This was a horrible place ordered online got a confirmation stating my order was ready, drove 25 miles to find out they offer curbside pickup and have the stalls marked for curbside pickup but don't enforce parking had to park about 200 feet away, get to the pick  onlinev order line have to wait 5 mins before they help me out, and then because my underage daughter didn't put my name as a authorized person for pickup I couldn't pick up the order even though my debt card was used and my name and address were on the billing information, I asked to cancel the order then and they tell me in 3-5 days they will cancel the order once no one picks up the order. This is the 2nd bad experience with Ulta< /review>< response>

I only do my shopping here every once in a while total of 3 times shopping here and I am dissatisfied with the customer service. My recent visit was the worse experience, cashier Daniela that ring me up purposely slam my items onto the countertop and demaged my bronzer and eyeshadow.< /text>

I think the last person that helped me when I was over there was Noah? He's taller, has cool hair, and is always super sweet and helpful. 5 stars Ulta and Noah, you rock! 😍<//review></record>

The most helpful staff I have ever encountered. They helped me find gifts for my mom and wife. I don’t know much about makeup but a young lady named Maria helped me and got me a new card and a nice discount. I am very appreciative and tell all my buddies at the lodge about this experience.<//text>

< Review>
I bought a kvd liquid liner and as soon as I got to the car I opened it to test it. The liner was beyond DRY. I walked back to the store to return it and they refused to help me because it was 7 on the dot and they had closed. They couldn’t even help me when I didn’t even have the product for more than 5 min. Instead I have to drive across town AGAIN because they couldn’t do something that wouldn’t even take 10 min. Poor service.<//Review>

I shopped here on the 23rd of this month when I tried to use my membership coupon the lady at the cashier stated I wasent able to use the coupon till after the 24th so I said ok even tho I read it and it stated that I had till the 24th to use my coupon not the other way around. So I trusted the employee only to find out today that I was correct and my coupon has expired worst customer service at this location I understand that it is crazy during the holiday seasons but that still doesn't excuse poor customer service.< /text>

WORST PLACE EVER... The girls are very rude and make shopping in there super uncomfortable. If you are looking for the complete makeup shopping experience you definitely won't get it here. They 𝙉𝙀𝙑𝙀𝙍 have the  free gifts with purchases. When you ask for help or have any questions they act like you are bothering them
And didn't even give me my full  birthday month points.</Text>

I was so unhappy with service here in this location. I had purchased some items online & went in to do returns.They stated that they couldn’t find my card information when I had receipts & my ID that lady gave me store merchandise credit instead of a gift card .Knowing that I only buy online I’m stuck with over $300 merchandise credit.& when I call they couldn’t fix it because of the way she returned the items.Never again.So dissatisfied.<//text>

First Ulta visit. I went in just for a facial. The set up is very private and comfortable. My skin therapist listened to my concerns, gave sound simple suggestions and made sure my skin felt great. I was relaxed enough to sleep. I plan to go again.</Text>

<text>Absolutely terrible service whenever we have gone here. We’ve gone when they were completely empty and it doesn’t seem to make a difference, never have we had someone offer my wife any help. Each time we’ve come in expecting to buy but taking our business elsewhere because they apparently don’t think it’s important to touch base with customers and offer help. Won’t be trying here again.</text>< pictures>

Everytime I come In here the security guard is nicer than the staff. They always have bad looks on their face and I NEVER get a smile. I arrived to do in store pick up and you're supposed to get in and out but there were 3 people behind the register and they all looked at me and one girl literally rolled her eyes like she didn't want to deal with me she then helped a customer who got in line AFTER I had been standing at the pick up counter for a minute or two. It says on website skip the line but not when the workers don't feel like it. The gentleman who finally gave me my items was nice I didn't catch his name but he was busy when I walked in so I don't blame him just the two females hanging out at the end of the registers talking and ignoring me while I was waiting to pick up the items I already paid for.< /text>

Felt like they were following everyone, us included. I was playing games on my girlfriends phone as i waited and had to always look back to see a lady behind me, maybe they wanted to see my high score? How about a “how can i help you? or have you tried so and so?” next time u make contact. Anyways it made the shopping experience bad for us so we bought nothing. I give you 1 star.< /text>

I went in to get my hair styled for photos...the girl who checked me in first of all was extremely rude. Saying the computer says I cancelled my appointment(which I didn't, but apparently when they send you one of those automated appointment reminders if you don't reply it cancels your apt). Anyway nobody else booked over my "cancelled" apt so i was still able to get in. Normally when you're waiting they offer you water. She did not, which was annoying. When the girl who would actually be styling me showed up she was super nice. I showed her a picture of what I wanted etc and she got started. All I needed was the bottom half of my waist long hair to have some nice big curls. I warned her that my hair does not hold curl well at all, and that she would need to do every trick she knew how to get it to hold. The end result looked perfect for the first 10 minutes but unfortunately it completely fell out in less than 2 hours and I did not mess with it at all. But she was super nice I would go back to her for a cut, I just dont know if I will ever get my hair to stay curled!< /Review>

<Name>Katelian Scotia</Name><date>1567377858457< /date><Rating>1< /Rating><text>I have gotten my hair done here by both Deja and Kyla in the past. I have a lady I like to go to at a fancier salon but sometimes funds are tight and Ulta is much cheaper. Both of the ladies reached out prior to my appointments to know exactly what I wanted. I have blonde hair and need my roots touched up. Which I have been blonde many times before and know how long it takes, like 2 hours maybe 3 at most! I went in today, without being reached out to this time which already made me a little disappointed, and was sent away because they felt they would not have enough time to do my hair even though they were open for 4 more hours. They did not say sorry, did not offer to reschedule as soon as possible. They made a bunch of excuses for themselves and acted like I was the one in the wrong. I will not be returning to this Ulta again. I sadly had a bad experience at the one in riverpark before too. I guess I just better save and go to the nicer salons. Avoid doing hair here.<//text>< Pics>

< Review>
I like this Ulta because it is always very clean and well stocked compared to the other Ultas in town. Also, the atmosphere is much brighter, it feels happy the second you walk in. Plenty of help. Largest selection of makeup and nail polish. You can easily spend $50 here and not feel the least bit guilty about it. I wish every other Ulta in Fresno and Clovis was like this one. I like that they employ guys as well. I have not tried the salon, but I cant help but notice how fantastic each girl looks when her appointment is over. The only thing that sucks about this location is the parking, but that is because it is at the mall.< /Review>

<text>I hate this ulta, theirs a manager there “Monique”. She is rude, the several times I’ve gone to this store unfortunately she is working, always with a long face. And her breath stinks. I’ve made a complaint against her with costumer service. She needs to learn how to be a better manager and work with her customer service Skills. Sadly she ruined my wishes to shop at ulta.< /text>< UserId.>

<rating>4< /rating><text>This ulta is usually never very busy and it's a good atmosphere. The staff seems nice and helpful. I recently got a new eyeliner, foundation and charcoal make up remover wipes. I was surprised to see they also sell really good razors that arent expensive compared to really good razor prices other places! I got two of their pre moisturized w shea butter razors and they work great. They have a ton of different brands and varieties of everything to choose from. They also have a good price range with every item so if you're aiming high with some of your products you can do that while aiming for low prices on others. I aim for low prices on my eye makeup and go for higher priced foundation, whether that's a good idea or not I am not sure Haha. But it's nice to have the ability to</text>< Pics>

Visited that specific store for the first time and not one Welcome from any workers. I walked around the same two aisles at least three times and not a single worker asked me if I needed help looking for something. So I go ask one of the older ladies about a brand and she seemed very annoyed and ignorant that I was even asking her, nonchalantly walking around and stood in front of a product just reading the sign while saying they “probably” didn’t carry the product anymore that I was looking for . So she walks off to the cashiers without even finishing telling me anything and starts talking to them. So I just backed away hoping she’d come back to verify they didn’t carry it anymore and she disappears. No one seemed to want to help out even when there weren’t a lot of customers in store. The cashier also didn’t make any eye contact. I’m not invisible. Have a little courtesy and look at people when you speak to them.</review>

Went there earlier this week and had an awful experience. I walked in when they were quite busy and the line was long. Cashier was flustered and annoyed with everything i had a question about. I don't shop Ulta much so i don't really know the rules on using coupons/points. When i told her about it, she was quite annoyed that i didn't know and when i wanted to put an item away because it didn't qualify for a coupon, she was upset. It isn't my fault line was long and there were only two cashiers. I am so much more reluctant to visit this Ulta again.<//review>

Walked in here for the first time and no welcoming or nothing! And since it was my fisrt time there i did need help looking for something that i specifically went in there to purchase. And walked the store like 2x looking for it until i was able to find it myself and i was also hoping i would get help in an item i wanted to buy but NOBODY acknowledged me! I guess they dont want to make any money here.<//text>

<text>Just avoid this store . I tried to give this store a chance but I’ve been here 3x and have had awful experiences. One of the managers name Rubi is always  rude af for no reason. And the other workers always seem annoyed when you ask for something.

Sad to say I just had a bad experience with a rude employee. Thinking I lost my phone, I asked an employee if it was possible to use their phone to call mine, thinking it may have fell in my car (my husband would have picked up my phone) or in the store. She replies “the manager is up front, go ahead and bug her about it”. Shocked And irritated by her rude response, I left the stuff I was going to buy, and walked out the store. During this time of year, customer service should be top priority, considering people are spending hundreds of dollars supporting your business.< /Text>

Went up to the cashier and asked for a certain color and all the cashier told me was that they were out before I even showed her what the product was and I constantly told her that I found it in the wrong location and she just told me that they were out they were out without even looking in the store.</review>

They pressured me so much into buying a chain I didn’t even want, I asked my sales rep. to “hold on while I look at the chain” he had my credit card and ID and continued to proceed with the purchase after I clearly asked him to hold on, he even handed me the chain so he clearly heard me. I’m very upset with this experience. Don’t come here.< /review>

<Text>I went in to get my jewelry cleaned and use my coupon I received in the mail and Aria N. treated me like a VIP. Even when it was determined I was not able to purchase anything today, I left with a free Jewelry Cleaner for my Jewelry and a pair of complimentary earrings in exchange for my coupon. I NEVER have been treated so nice by a person before at a store, and yet he didn’t know I was diagnosed with cancer less than two week ago and I was trying to get my ring cleaned to give it to my sister in case I don’t survive it all! Thank you Aria N. for you kindness and treating me like a VIP today! I will not forget it! And if I survive this, I will celebrate life with a purchase from your store personally from you!< /Text>< Rate>

<name>Alon Cohen<//name><user_id>103034201166877026925</user_id><Review>Purchasing your first Rolex is big step for every man. After thorough research and a lot of store hopping, negotiating, and unclosed deals. I happened to stop at Kevin Jewelers. I was immediately greeted by Rod. After spending much time being presented all of the models they had in store, and even browsing through the watches they had in their database. I felt more like I was talking to an advisor and a friend than a salesperson. After finally making a decision on the Rolex for me, it was a seamless transaction from beginning to end and I will only go here for my big jewelry purchases from now on!

If you don’t want to deal with pushy salesmen and have the need for any ultra high quality jewelry and impeccable customer service, go see Rod, Vida, and the team at Kevin Jewelers Topanga!</Review>< date>

I came with no expectations.
And i was serviced with care.
And Aria and Ben and Parisa helped me pick the ring for my lady.
I left with happiness and satisfaction.
Thank you Kevin Jewelers. !!!<//review>

< Review>
At first they think we are not buying so no one wants to help us. Even when we ask saleslady to see one of the jewelry’s it takes 2mins before she approach us. So when we are gathering what we are buying they are rushing us. I understand we went there at 8:00pm almost closing but they should have not treated us like that. They should be happy that we’re buying so they can get commission. But this is not what we get from them. Poor customer service!</Review>

I went in here looking for my first pair of princess cut diamond stud earrings. They were having an incredible 75% off purchases for their anniversary.  Perfect opportunity!  I was having a problem with my bank card and I couldn't make the purchase. The AMAZING employees went out of their way to help me by calling the bank and getting it straightened out. I was able to purchase my first ever diamond earrings! Absolutely incredible customer service! Thank you guys so much. I will be back! 😊</review>

< Review>
I was just glancing at the shining jewelry, hoping that noone would nudge me to spend too much, when the lovliest, soft-spoken woman asked me if I needed any help. The next thing I knew, she was showing me the exact right wedding band for my diamond ring from my husband of 17 years. It was perfect, and she didn't push me at all. She cleaning my diamond ring beautifully.
Then, when I asked if I could pay with a check from my Charles Schwab account, she asked her manager, who treated me with the same kind of ease and kindness. She made sure my check was good, which only took her about 20 seconds,  and treated me with the utmost respect and gentleness.
I told them that over the years, my husband and I had bought his wedding ring, and watch, and a gorgeous diamond baguette ring from Kevin's, and I couldn't be happier with my amazing ring. It's so glorious!</Review>

<text>Everyone at this facility is attentive and go above and beyond for their customers. I and my fiancee went in for an exchange that another Kevin Jewelers screwed me on and they took care of my fiancee right away. I thank you guys for turning a horrible experience to one of the best.

<text>I give 1 star bcz I love my ring.  Mary my sales rep. Never sized me and when I called her to remind her she either mis-read or lied and said that the ring was my size.  When I went to get my ring it was too big and all she could say was "you can leave it again".  She never assumed responsibility for poor customer service and me being inconvenienced .  So after 2 weeks with a too big ring I took it to the Northridge store to have it sized.  A lady sized me never asked me anything just told me it would be ready after 5pm.. I came back and it was once again too big.  So I had to go back once again!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Explaining my frustration of taking off of work, my time, gas and it being the third time trying to get it sized, still no one offered an apology.. They tried to have me drop it off and I told them to keep the ring and cancel.  Not sure why a jewelry store like this couldn't get it right and no one ever apologized. I got a diamond set in the ring in place of a cluster of diamonds.  It was my understanding that they would keep those diamonds and drop the price, instead they handed me a baggy of little diamonds. I also got an accidental text from Mary saying that I would get a $100 coupon but then she text me that that text wasn't meant for me.  I hadn't bought a ring in 22 years but when I get ready to buy another I'm not sure that I will go back to you guys.

I'm not going to lie in the past I have bounced around nail shops based on the service level & cost. This shop does a great job on eyebrow waxing and I like to get my pedicure done here as well. The prices are reasonable and I have called around to other nail shops that I have gone to before & this shop seems like the only place that has not raised their prices due to Covid which is very much appreciated. The shop has always been very clean & they are honoring social distancing & doing temperatures. Masks are required & there is also a barrier between yourself & the employee. They have lots & lots of nail polish choices too. They accept cash & debit / credit cards however if you do use a card there is an extra charge of either .50 cents or 1.00 sorry I don't remember the exact amount. They are a great shop that I have gone to for well over a decade and I plan on continuing to do so. Thank you Luxury Nails & Spa.</Text>

I have been coming here for years. They have always treated me well. I've never walked away unhappy and they will go out of their way to accommodate any requests I have. They are reasonably priced. They offer a huge selection of colors and nail tip types. Again, if you want something you don't see just ask. I take pictures of nail designs all the time. Acrylic Nails. Waxing. Pedicures.

Very rude... I completely understand all the new guidelines and protocols.. I appreciate that they were doing everything by the book.. but that doesn’t include being rude.. I waited in the chair for 30 minutes and when I finally asked how much longer the man just yelled at me and so did one of the nail techs. I just got up and left... only gave 1star for their safety precautions but customer service was the worse.<//Review>

<review>This was my very first time coming here and I had a great experience. It was very busy and I had to wait about 15 minutes but it was a Saturday that is to be expected if you are going to a nail salon. So I ended up getting a full set and the lady who helped me was great she listen to everything I said and wanted and she did such a great job the nail salon is good size nail salon very clean very professional and they do all the modern styles and shapes of nails right now definitely coming back and I feel their prices are reasonable<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdRspo3G4XdBm3ou34W-x9RpoTkcnJDej5vJU7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Great place. The nail technician took her time and was diligent. Took me about 45 minutes for gel manicure. Came out to $26 with card. They do not accept tips on card though, so you have to have cash.< /Text>< Rate>

I have been coming here since they opened and when they were in Grand Terrace.

It is a clean and efficient shop. The manicurists are professional and friendly.

I have not had a bad experience here ever.

They give quality work and aim to please. They are honest and make sure that you know what you are getting.

Sometimes we can be unrealistic and ask for them to create something from a picture but they will be upfront if it’s not going to be exactly what you show in a picture. Just be open to accept it. They WILL make it nice and you will be pleased.

Try them out! They’re the best.<//Text>

This nail salon always does a great job. I have been here about 5 times and they are always so nice. I will always get compliments and ask where I got them done. Also, the prices are great. I would recommend this to anyone.< /Review>

Me and my mom went in to get pedicures I got my mom a manicure as well and myself a full set. My toes aren’t in the best shape so I asked the lady not to do certain things but she did them anyways and ended up hurting me. I walked outta there with bloody cuticles on my toes and my nails looking like they were done by a 5 year old child. My full set is okay but the paint is already chipping on it and the lady did them how she wanted and when I asked her to do them a certain way she acted like she didn’t know what I was talking about. It’s now been 4 days And me and my mom both have ingrown infected nails on our hands and our feet. We will never go back to this place again. I paid $100 for something I could’ve done a better job at and I wouldn’t have gotten infected nails from their dirty equipment. I’m highly disappointed in the quality and the prices. Definitely not what I paid for. My 6 year old niece could’ve done better than these people did. NEVER EVER going back.< /Text>

They have great prices and lots of gel polish choices as well as regular nail polish. Lynn and Ann are the best nail technicians they do everything from gel polish to full sets and even waxing. They have awesome design skills, you take a picture and they will replicate that design on your nails or toes. Pedicures I recommend Vivian  or Tina they give amazing massages. They ask if the water is hot enough and they have clean equipment. I Love this place my gel mani lasts me 3 weeks(: Give this place a try you wont be disappointed don't let the negative reviews scare you. For those who complain I say speak up don't go home and write a bad review if you would simply tell them you are not satisfied they will fix the problem. Like I mentioned I have never had an issue always been extremely happy and relaxed after visiting Luxury Nails. I do recommend to make an appointment as they do get busy!!!</Review>< Pics>

<Review>I've been here 3 times prior to this review and I couldn't believe the other reviews on here, they were written quit some time ago, so it's about time they get the recognition they deserve. I've been to other salons that deserved bad ratings but that doesn't describe what this shop should be. I've always been promptly  greeted and seated as soon as I walk through the door, usually without an appointment. The ladies and gentlemen that do work there are all very sweet and try to make you feel comfortable. I would definitely recommend this salon to anyone and everyone.

I've been coming to Luxury Nails for more than 7 years. I see many of the same customers here all the time. I have never heard anyone complain about the service, staff, prices, etc. I do know that reviews must be taken with a grain of salt. Disgruntled ex-employees, over demanding customers, other businesses lying to try and take customers. I am a delighted customer and I recommend that you check it out yourself.</review>

<Review>Clean, friendly, nice place. Staff is generally always so sweet. The first few times I got a gel manicure it was done really nice. The last time i went, my nails looked horrible! At first she asked if I wanted my nails cut and I told her a little bit but she cut them so short that she messed up my rounded nails and made them squared (even after clarifying to her I wanted rounded nails). One hand had streaks and my pedicure got messed up at the salon and she didnt fix it (eventhough she knew she messed it up when putting on my sandle). I noticed at home and didn't have time to go back and get them fixed. Definitely recommend going in the morning/earlier hours because they rush towards the later day and service isn't that great. Other than that time, I really liked going there and prices are fair. They always worked with an idea that girls gave them. Even when its busy they let you know that you are noticed which is nice considering some places wait forever to seat you when its busy. Overall, good place and staff!<//Review>< time>

<text>On Monday I had a manicure/pedicure with gel fingernails. This was my second visit to this salon.   On Tuesday night, I noticed that the gel started peeling on one finger.  Wednesday morning I called and told them what was happening, I was told to come on in and they will take care of it.
Well, I went in this morning and Emily was very apologetic for me having to come back in.  She cleaned my nails off and redid both hands,  I am recommending this salon, because every body deserve a second chance.  Thank you Emily, I look forward to seeing you in about 3 weeks.</text><username>Yvonne Baird<//username><date>1447972658612</date><user_id>103568503842368646468< /user_id><response>{'time': 1449161968481, 'text': 'Thank you Yvonne, we look forward to seeing you again.'}<//response>< Rate>

To be honest I only treat myself to the luxury of having my nails done twice a year once on my birthday and the other on December 31 this year I went early and I AM REGRETTING IT NOW!

So I am no expert but I always thought STERILIZATION was a must for any NAIL SALON to prevent BACTERIA OR OTHER LIVING MICROORGANISM FROM BEING TRANSFERRED FROM ONE CLIENT TO ANOTHER.

This would be done by DISINFECTING AND STERILIZATION OF THEIR NAIL EQUIPMENT after each use on a client by placing the equipment in a disinfecting solution or autoclave to prevent contamination from one client to the next.

It would seem that from what I personally witnessed and EXPERIENCE is that Luxury Nails & Spa has decided and clearly choosen not to follow this procedure.

Unfortunately I discovered this fact way to late as in most Nail Salons there are distractions mine was the TV which I was focused on and had not noted the nail equipment which was being USED ON ME WAS NOT CLEAN OR STERILIZED.

AND EVEN MORE SHOCKING WAS that after she used them on me she simple tossed them in a drawer along with a variety of other mixed nail equipment.

As I watched in SHOCK THAT SHE DID NOT EVEN WIPE THE EQUIPMENT OR PLACE THEM IN A STERILIZATION SOLUTION NOPE JUST TOSSED THEM IN THAT DRAWER.

Now here is the sad part as I was standing at the counter I looked over to see this very same person greet another client and reached in pull out the SOILED AND UNSANITARY NAIL EQUIPMENT JUST USED ON ME PROCEEDED TO DO THE NEXT CLIENTS NAILS.

I guess there is no true way to tell if the next time you go have your nails done the nail equipment is clean UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY SEE THEM REMOVE THEIR EQUIPMENT OUT OF STERILIZATION SOLUTION IN FRONT OF YOU.

I have no plans to go back and now it is the waiting game to see if I RECEIVED A PARTING GIFT OF A NAIL FUNGUS FROM LUXURY NAILS & SPA.

I would advise you against going to Luxury Nails & Spa the THOUGHT AND FEAR OF WHAT OTHER POSSIBLE INFECTION I MAY HAVE RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF THE UNSANITARY STANDARDS IS A VERY REAL CONCERN.

So before you sit down in that chair ask to see where the nail equipment is BEFOREHAND.

Because the few minutes it takes to ask the question in the begining will save you hours of worry in the end.

This place is awful, I left in the middle of my nails being done and got them fixed at Lv nails in the shopping center next door smart an final. LV nails were cheaper, more professional and had way more selections. Jenny was awesome. Would not go back to Luxury Nails<//Text>

They do not sanitize or sterilize anything. They give most people fungus. My friends daughter went there a couple of weeks ago and days later her finger nail came off full of fungus. I posted a picture but they won't post until they review. I Also gave them one star because it wouldn't allow me to review or comment without giving at least one star.

A 15 year old girl just had her sweet 15 and like any other girl her age she went to get her nails done for her big day. She went to Luxury Nails & Spa in Riverside. Unfortunately this place had bad service and was rude. By Tuesday one of her nails got purple and swollen. Her parents took her to the ER and they told her that her nail got infected. The nail place more then likely didn't use sanitary tools and caused her nail to get an infection. They had to remove her whole nail. She was in so much pain. The manager of this nail place doesn't want to have nothing to do with this issue. The mother of this lovely girl went in person and they told her that they can't help her and that there is nothing that they can do for her. I ask that you please share this and beware of the nail places you go to. Thank you!<//Text>

This was not the case, the first two times I came to get my nails done, and I asked for a gel manicure on my natural nails and they came out ridiculously thick (I understand that gel is thicker than regular polish) but this was just excessive! I told the nail tech that they were too thick and she refused to fix them, she charged me 40$ dollars, which in my option is ridiculous! and not to mention how incredibly rude the staff is
.The third time and the LAST time I will ever come here again!, I went in to get my eyebrows done and I clearly expressed I just wanted to get them cleaned up and keep the SAME shape, she left them SO HORRIBLY thin! It will at least take me a full on 6 months to grow back my thin haired and now THIN LOOKING eyebrows! I honestly would just take my money someplace else, like I said I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and I was very much proved WRONG.

My husband and I were in on July 26, 2011. I was having a pedicure and he was having a manicure. I had been in once before and the girl had done so good a job that I told my friends to go there. This time, I asked for her by name and asked if she was available. I was told yes, but no one ever got her. She never came even though I asked twice. I wanted her because I have neuropathy and she was very sensitive to that. When the other girl was trimming I asked her to shorten them some more, because I hate long toenails...I want them short short. She said she couldn't because there was skin there. What? There was always skin there and I've always had them short. Made no sense and she refused to trim any more. Also, my chair massage turned off and I couldn't reach it to turn it back on and no one would reach it for me. The massage chair is the main attraction of a spa pedicure for me.When my husband and I left, I looked at his manicure and I was furious...it looked dull and just awful. No buffing no nothing. All they did was push his cuticles back and file his nails. I paid $24 for the two of us. I might as well have flushed that money for the crappy service I got. I will never go back, and all those friends that I told to go there?....I'm going to tell them to stay away...far away!!!<//text>

She continued laughing at me n still hurting me i finally got up from chair ask for HELP.

She was laughing at me.& massage was bending my fingers incorrectly..

So then i got new help. And she told her ""awww she a baby"". Ouch ouch ..

I walked out crying cuz in PAIN & humiliation
I did not give her a tip..i also said to manager you need to discuss with your workers that customers are here to relax & enjoy the spa..... Not to get put down n hurt.

<text>I've gone here three times & left everytime dissapointed, I went in about a month ago and my cuticles have no grown back because they are healing from the amount of times my fingers got cut, the ladies talked trash about me, I later found out from another employee who spoke English. She told me that they were saying, " why is a boy getting nails " they are VERY rude. & only two people know what they are doing while the rest stand around & do nothing. Price point way too expensive for the quality of the nails. Do not come here.< /text>< Pics>

<review>Look on Facebook. Its posted all over how some girl just had her nails done and her pinky finger (not sure what hand) got infected. It looks horrible. I would never go to that place ever! And I know a lot of people are reposting that picture of her pinkey to warn us women, not to ever go there. They don't sterilize that equipment. This place is infested with bacteria, which = fungus. Save your money. DO NOT GO HERE.</review><username>Angel Imus</username><Rating>1</Rating></record>

I would never come here again! My sister in law and mother in law brought me here to get my nails done a day before my wedding. The wait was stupid long and they let several people who came after us go ahead of us. Once they called me I waited for 20 mins at the technitions table while she wasn't there. After she came I waited almost 10 more mins so she could get off her damn phone. I told her how I wanted them and took it apon herself to do it compleatly different and get mad when I asked her about it. About 4 days later 2 nails popped off. I will never go again!< /Review>

<Text>NEVER AGAIN!!! I was a loyal customer at Luxury for 4 years, but after what happened to me this last time I will never go again! I was there for a routine fill, pedicure and eyebrow wax during the pedicure I see the girl reach for nail glue to GLUE MY TOE NAIL TOGETHER BECAUSE SHE SPLIT It while she was cutting off the hang nails and Lynn the owner told her to do it and she was WATCHING THE WHOLE TIME!!! it wasn't just a little cut in to the nail it was SPLIT IN THE MIDDLE AND HORIZONTALLY. I didn't even feel it but it doesn't matter that shouldn't ever happen!! The fill another girl gave me was completely horrible, I have the white french tips and when she cut them down the white was all un even and I can see the line where the original acrylic is threw the new acrylic and the clear coat NEVER dried all the way, not even untill the next day! And for my eyebrows I had to TELL HER how to do them cause if not I probably wasn't going to have any hair left!! I'm NEVER GOING AGAIN and neither is my mother-inlaw because after 1 week her acrylic nails were already getting ready to fall off!!<//Text></record></dataset><record>
<text>I have gone there 4 times now and I didn't even know that I was getting a nail infection, they were to rough with my hands, and when they would take my gel polish off they would drill into my real nail giving me a deep ring of fire.</text>< response>

<Text>This place is horrible !!! Watch out the workers are rude and some 15 year old girl got her nail removed because this place more likely didn't use sanitary tools and caused her nail an infection.  Maria ibarra (chiquiz) is the name of the person who posted the picture of the poor girl.<//Text>< Pictures>

I have been going to this place for years and within this last year it has gone so down hill . The people are rude af , they talk crap about their customers , and you  almost never walk out paying the amount you think u will b paying . The colors are not accurate to the examples.It didn't look like they clean their tools regularly either . My advice don't come here !! I won't b giving them my money anymore ✌🏻</Text>

They still do, just not during their busiest time.... LUNCH. That way they can focus on getting the people in the store and orders out.
Been coming here for years and still love it. Phone it in early if you need to grab and go.< /text>< resp>

Excellent authentic Italian deli. Great sandwiches, hot food ( lasagna, meatballs, Italian sausage, super garlic bread. Also frozen tortellini, lasagne, and ravioli. Scrumptious selection of great Italian desserts. The cannoli is excellent. "Leave the gun take the Cannoli"s".<//review>

Genova has been the best deli for as long as I can remember. I still haven’t found a deli anywhere that compares. Fresh, quality ingredients and helpful friendly staff.</review>

<Review>Well I was really excited to grab a sandwich from my favorite spot in my old home town. After the first bite all the excitement went away quickly. Dutch crunch bread is supposed to be crunchy. Hence the name. It was almost greasy and not appetizing at all.$40 later for 2 sandwiches 1 drink and a 1/2 pint of salad. 100% disappointed, so many other great choices in the area I doubt I'll go back. Even the marinated mushrooms are junk now.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>This place is classic. They have the greatest food.
Try the clam chowder, it is to die for.
Oh, the sandwiches, I bought another today. Awesome!

<Review>OMG! My first time in since I moved back home to Napa. Unequivocally the best Italian deli I've ever been in! I look forward to the end of COVID-19, so I can hang out at the bar! Highly recommend!</Review>< Pics>

The clam chowder is the second best north of the golden gate bridge.
Well worth a two hour drive.
But they can't fix a plumbing problem and they don't sell fresh fish.
Everything else is 5 stars.
It's best to ask for your own combination and avoid the menu board.</text>

Genova isn't taking phone orders during Covid-19, forcing people have to go into the store, take a number, wait, order while there, and then wait while it's prepared. Ridiculously backward. Just take the phone order and pre-prep it so people can walk in, pay, take their food and leave.< /text>

<text>Wasn't a fan of the Oakland location, it's closed now. So was hesitant to try this one. Boy I'm glad I did. Excellent macaroni salad. Good meats on the sandwiches. Good choice of bread. Quality as well. A little on the high price, but quality matched that. You get what you pay for. Give it a try and decide for yourself. I sure you won't be disappointed.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< date>

When I'm in town visiting family one of my favorite places a definite must a great Italian deli. My favorite things are the sandwiches freshly baked bread and great meats and cheeses. They also have so much other great food freshly made daily. I recommend getting there early or call ahead because they get pretty busy.<//Text>

<review>Fantastic staff, very friendly, helpful and courteous.  Fresh baked breads for the sandwiches.  One of the only delis that serve true German red potato salad.  Generous portions on all their sandwiches.  I particularly love their meatloaf on sweet roll sandwich.  And as much condiments (lettuce, spinach,tomatoes, etc. as you want.

A deli experience you don’t want to miss.<//review><UserId.>118280999544718737224</UserId.><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<username>Julia Kwan<//username><Time>1480877801562< /Time><Text>This place is a must visit! Delicious, generously portioned sandwiches with a super cute wine/coffee bar and all the Italian goods you could want, all in one spot. This is no hidden gem, so be prepared to wait in line for the deli. Faves are #4 (caprese + prosciutto sandwich) and #11 (Genova's Italian-ed out BLT), all on soft sour. Regardless of the day's planned meals, I'll try to stop by to get these to lug back home and savor.</Text>< rating>

<Review>The food and sandwiches are amazing, though it's only a once in a long while treat since prices have gone up so much.
The place is always clean and the staff are generally nice.<//Review>< Date>

I'm born and raised in Brooklyn, NY and this is the closest to a deli back home! The bread and meats were delicious and high quality. An extra added bonus of the deli is a coffee bar with small tables and small shop with premium, imported Italian grocery items. I'm really glad I randomly noticed this place when I was in Napa. I'll definitely be back again!< /Text>

If you are in Napa, this is a great place to eat - real Italian and really good !If your touring area for the day, stop here for picnic lunch to then eat around vineyards. They pack it all for an easy to serve meal. They have amazing take home pasta freezer dinners and sauces.
Ever-thing you could want for a great meal !</Text>

< Review>
I miss the institution in Oakland. I hate having to come all the way to Napa to experience a true Italian delicatessen. But every time I'm in Napa, this is a must-stop place. The clam chowder is extremely delicious with big pieces of clam. They're friendly and move very quickly to get through the long lines. It is worth the wait. My go-to sandwich is the Italian combo with hot coppa added on an onion roll. Other things of note that I've never leave without are the deviled eggs and the stuffed peppers with prosciutto and feta cheese.<//Review>

<text>Local gem!!!! Fuss free Italian deli - great fresh and imported meets! From prosciutto to mortadella to cheeses.

Pair your sandwich with a house made side (we got potato salad - delicious).

Don’t let the line intimidate you! You can enjoy some coffee at the coffee bar, or shop around.

True Italian feel!!!!<//text>< pics>

GREAT local Italian deli with phenomenal sandwiches. I had the sriracha chicken with no onions and couldn’t help but scarf it down after a morning of nothing but coffee. Take a number and be prepared to wander around until you are called. Also, a little advice for Kellen (taller guy, strong facial features): smile more and be friendly! You’re a handsome fellow; don’t look like you can’t stand working here!< /Text>

I’ve been going to Genova for years and the taste hasn’t changed. Their deli and sandwiches are absolutely yummy! Fresh ingredients and a wide selection as well. It definitely isn’t cheap, but worth every penny.<//Text>

Great food! A bit of wait time since it's a rather small operation, but if you have some time give it a go.< /Text>

This is the best deli in sonoma county by far. The hand made Italian foods are better than home made. Genovas has been our family tradition for over 40 years in my family.<//Review>

I've always loved this deli! Used to have 2 choices in Napa for for the type of service and food I expect from a deli, Genova and Vallergas... Sadly Vallergas closed. Happily Genova is still going strong, maintaining their quick service and quality product. Thanks Genova!!!</text>

<text>Felt like my friend and I were treated like queens. Went in at prime lunch time but after waiting our turn received "full" treatment. Clerk prepared our sandwiches and side salads, then brought our water to the table. Most customers are "to-go" orders.

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Whoa. Stop the car and get in here for a sandwich, take a salami home. These guys are artists. Pat helped me assemble a tasty sandwich in the traditional Italian method-simple. The imported prosciutto was visibly better than the domestic, the taste was phenomenal. The soft sour dough undeniably perfect for a sandwich. The compilation of bread, oil, mixed meats and peppers was great. We ate outside, the ambiance was nice.< /Review>< pics>

The food is always fantastic!! Every time we come home to Napa to visit family, this is a must stop place for us. The wait may be daunting,  especially during lunch, but is well worth it. They have a large selection of breads and sandwiches to choose from,  as well as meats, salads and other items. The prices are very reasonable.<//review>

Great Deli!
Depending on the time of day, parking usually very good. Awesome, and high quality sandwich meats. They also serve hot food for lunch specials. High quality desserts. It's a little expensive, but it's worth the price for good quality food.

When you go in, you need to take a ticket with a number on it. With this in mind, they will call out your number when you're up. This is when you place your order. They also have all types of cold salads, macaroni, ravioli, several types of potato salads.

They also offer imported dry foods, which you can't get at other stores. This is a high end Delicatication. They also offer hot soups. I really do appreciate these types eateriess.<//Review>

I am gluten free, not by choice, and when I asked if the polenta was gluten free, I was rudely dismissed with "We don't have anything gluten free". Well, they have meats, chicken, some salad, etc. When I stated that polenta is usually gf, the man went and asked his co worker and was dismissed as nothing is gf here. I was struck by how arrogant the taller guy was as he asked me if I had a number when I was one of two people standing at the counter. There were no numbers as they were stuck in the machine. He sent me back to the original guy waiting on my sister. There was no friendliness at all as I remember from a few years back. I ordered a couple of slices of roast beef and cheese. I was appalled that the man picked them up with his hands. We should have walked out then and there. He packed it in the bag with the hot soup and lasagna and when I got home, the cheese was melted and stuck to the paper. My mother said the minestrone was not flavorful so was quite disappointed. The arrogance and lack of good customer service is off putting.< /review>

Always busy, but they have an excellent deli counter and fun import goods.  Great selection of beverages.  Miss not having them here in the Bay Area, glad to have discovered them in Napa.</Text>

This place has great deli sandwiches and also a great selection of Italian deli foods. We love getting their frozen pasta and fresh sauces. I also got some of their cheese and salami and loved both.<//Review>

Dont find delis like this anymore. Good food, friendly staff, and great environment. Not much of a sit down and eat restaurant but you will see groups of people hanging out munching on their sandwiches while gabbing about their day. I visit every time I come to napa.<//Review>

<review>I was really disappointed when Monticello Deli went out of business, losing me my favorite delicatessen. While searching for a place to scratch my deli sandwich itch, we stopped by Genova and found it a more-than-suitable replacement. I'm not sure why u had never given this city institution a fair shake before, but I definitely regret not doing so now. The food and ambiance are great, the service is friendly and speedy (especially considering how popular this spot is), and there's definitely something for everyone.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808506ddbb2d59c3:0xc533c77987241f19< /GmapID></record>

Just walk in the door, and the smells make it worth a trip...the best sandwiches and greatest assortment of imported cold cuts...Wonderful selection of homemade gravies and sauses... Nonis gravy, most authentic, pesto a dream.and do not forget a slice or two of the artichoke frittata, 😋 yummy.< /Review>

This is one of the best delicatessens in all of California. Every time I visit Napa I stop here.  Ever since my wife had her first sandwich here she can't wait to get back for another.</Text>

Best Italian combo sando in the Bay Area. Real Italian deli with great service. Call in you order before 11am or fax it in. Lines can get very long but worth it. For the guy who gave Genova 4 stars, who talks politics with a bald guy behind the counter?</review>

The best sandwhich in town. There are 2 places to go in Napa... Don Giavanis for dinner and Genovas for a great sandwhich and a cold beer before you leave town. Let the wife drive. There is also some sort of laundry mat that has pretty good food but it's in Yountville.</review>

The little Italy of Napa. I would not expect to see a place like this from where it's located. Inside it's a whole different atmosphere, and if it were downtown or on the river it would probably be the hotspot.< /review>

< Review>
I Had a sandwich and a quart and minestrone soup. The price was out of this world. --- The sandwich was the worst sandwich I've ever had. The meat was sparce, mostly in the middle, with nothing on the ends. Paid for extra cheese, and i got one slice. One thin slice of cheese!
--- The ministrone soup sucked. Any canned minestrone soup is by, far, better. --- The store across the street makes sandwiches that include cheese and soup for half the cost.<//Review>

<Date>1487284424521</Date><review>One of the very few places in Napa to get a decent bowl of soup that isn't clam Chowder. Not to mention that the best deli meats and cheeses make the best sandwiches. However they take their time with your food, and I mean that in a positive way, so If you are in a hurry maybe try a different place. But I you have a little while to enjoy your lunch this place can't be missed. ( Try the Ministrone its my fave)< /review><Rate>5</Rate>< Pictures>

<Review>This place is a Napa institution.  It's 1 part deli, 1 part grocery store, and 1 part wine store.  Great food (sandwich, pasta salads, deli meats, and take home items- like lasagna).  It gets crazy crowded at lunch so call ahead to place your order.<//Review><Name>Joselyn Perez</Name>< Date>

Delicious and amazing sandwiches. Not a five star because I had to wait more than 45 minutes so my number got called. A really busy delly/store so make sure to grap a number to order from the delly.</Review>

On our Wine Tours, atleast 75% of our clients order sandwiches and then eat them picnic style at a winery. I believe the website is down, but there is a link to pictures of the menu on our website Wine Voyage of Napa.

Lunch is typically $10-$12 per person. Insider tip; call them between 9 and 10 AM to order ahead of time and skip what can be a long wait.< /text>< pictures>

Let me tell you if you are ever in Napa and you want a fantastic sandwich with the freshest most delicious sourdough the real sourdough you know the one one that has that pulling sensation when you bite it ohhhh my godddd I will drive from Fairfield to Napa for one of these sandwiches yeah the cost about $8 dollars but believe me they are well worth it and the old fashion soda fountain where they mix whatever flavor soda you like I had watermelon my daughter had coconut/strawberry so so so good. Please take a drive you won't be disappointed<//Text>
