I scheduled a 3’o clock appointment with Dr. Gregory Brown for a neck adjustment. He was very professional and I feel great. Overall, it was excellent and I highly recommend him for anybody in need for a chiropractor.<//Review>

Wow this was such a wonderful experience. The doctor was so knowledgeable, very knowledgeable about the body and what you need to feel amazing. They assisted me right away. I went in for cupping and acupuncture and left feeling so good. I had a lot of pressure on my shoulders and I don’t even feel that anymore. I would 100% do this again and I recommend 10 out of 10</Text>

I got massaged on my shoulder blade area without getting an actual massage yet Matt was able to get the knots and pain out somehow that I went to book massage #2.

I would like to express how happy I am with my massage service at Health Atlast! Candice was superb! She was friendly, professional, knowledgeable and overall absolutely does great massages. She knows the body well and it shows. Proper pressure in the right areas, she keeps good consistent touch so there is no disruption in the flow of the massage. I would recommend Candice to anyone’s massage needs. Looking forward to my next appointment! Thank you!<//Review>

<rating>3</rating><text>Clean office, very friendly staff, including my massage therapist. I unfortunately left feeling no different than when I walked in. If anything, I actually got a weird dull pain in my right lower back afterwards... I gave my massage therapist all the directions as far as what I wanted to get worked on - shoulder blades and shoulders. I encouraged her to go stronger and mentioned what type of pressure I usually apply to relieve the pain. She followed all my directions as far as areas, and I kept giving her feedback throughout but at some point I realized that she simply wasn’t a good fit for me technique-wise. It felt like she was gently caressing me, adding some stretches here and there. As a professional musician with a bunch of aches and pains, that’s not the type of deep tissue massage that brings me relief. I still thanked her, tipped her and all, because she was very attentive, but my shoulders and shoulder blades still feel super tight.
Sad it ended up being disappointing :(</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Excellent massage!  The only thing that would have made it better would been to have my aching feet included in the massage, but since it was just under 50 minutes I guess there wasn’t enough time. Great massage therapist though.</Text>

<review>I booked an appointment for my mom here. It was a surprise for her. The day of the massage I had called my mom to see if she was on her way and she was confused. She said she had not received anything. I called the place and the lady over the phone said they wrote down the wrong information, therefore my mom did not know it was for her. They are making her pay the 25 dollar fee and I think it's ridiculous since the receptionist admitted they were wrong. Very terrible customer service to the girl who answered the phone today (4/5/21 12:52pm). Her exact words were "Well you knew, you could have told her" no lady I specifically said it was a surprise, therefore I gave you her information and not mine!<//review>< Pictures>

{'time': 1617660853645, 'text': 'Hi Nancy,  we spoke with your mom and let her know that we would waive the $25 fee this time.  However, she was aware of her appointment.  She called at 12:10 pm to cancel her 12:00 pm appointment.  If she knew about the appointment, it was not a surprise!  The only mistake we made was using the name Vivian on the confirmation text to her instead of Lillian.  When appointments are made over the phone, sometimes the names are taken down wrong, especially when they sound similiar, like Vivian and Lillian.  We do apology for that and any other part we played in this situation.  We never have the intention of upsetting any of our clients, but we do have policies in place requiring 24-hours notice for cancellations, and this policy is told to every single person booking appointments at our office.  We have confirmed with your mother, her rescheduled appointment, and will confirm again with her 24-hours before it. Yours in Health! Dr. Karen Tafreshi'}<//Resp>

Massages here are okay, they don't really know how to do deep tissue to be honest.. just a light touch type massage place. However the chiropractor is totally worth coming for! Surprised my friend with an appointment after our massages and he was turned from a disbeliever into a believer real quick! The chiropractor here knows his stuff and honestly they are the best prices around. I've looked for places closer to home and they are waaaay pricer.

<Text>I found Health Atlast through Groupon. I went in for a 1 hour deep tissue massage with aromatherapy. It’s a health & wellness office that offers other services as well:

Chiropractic adjustments
30 minute massage
60 minute massage
Acupuncture
Trigger point injections
B-12 injections

They’re located in a business complex with plenty of parking and easy access to them on the 2nd floor. I was greeted by a friendly receptionist and my appointment started on time.

Xio was my massage therapist. I know it’s been awhile since I’ve had a massage because my last one was well before covid hit, but wow she’s good! She asked where my trouble spots were and if I wanted to focus on those or have a full body massage. I chose to focus on my trouble spots and she worked on all the knots and found some that I didn’t know were there. I like a deep tissue massage to really get in deep, her pressure was just right. She did check in w me to make sure I was ok though. You don’t wanna leave a massage feeling worse than when you went in, right?  😊

After I was done, I went back to the friendly receptionist who explained their services and the packages that were available for purchase. They also accept insurance so you should check to see if they accept yours. If they don’t, they still offer discounted packages.

Health Atlast is awesome! Definitely give them a try!< /Text></record>

She demonstrates good knowledge of the human body and finds the exact spots that need extra attention. My sister and I both value her services immensely. She definitely has a healing touch. Also, it's the little things that make a place memorable and make you want to keep going. They always seem to have a bowl of tangerines at the front desk for patients who rush in and may have not eaten. Those tangerines saved me from a low blood sugar last time I went. Their prices are reasonable.</Text>< Pictures>

They are very easy to talk to, very friendly, and the location is very welcoming. It did not have a classic Dr office vibe at all, it was very "homey".  There is plenty of parking as well. I am recommending this location to all my friends and family! I recommend keeping an eye out for the specials!< /review>

I saw Dr. Brown who was very careful and sensitive to that fact I was in pain and nervous.
I also had a massage the next day with Josh who was really good!!!  I will be an ongoing customer.

<Text>Great office, pleasant staff & Matthew the massage therapist is great at his profession. Im hooked! I'm definitely going to make this a weekly or biweekly routine!
- Originally I purchased a groupon for 2 full body massages & made an appt but did not show up due to a family emergency, and they redeemed my groupon because the spot was reserved (which I understand) but I was upset because the groupon was for 2 massages/appts. so I spoke to the manager who decided to empathize with me & honor my full Groupon. So far I have attended 2 appointments & have had a wonderful experience. Front office girl is nice & prompt & my massages with Matthew have been so calming & peaceful,  and just the right pressure!< /Text>< name>

< review>
Friendly, knowledgeable, and genuinely helpful staff. I've been going here for a few years now and regularly get excellent chiropractic care and absolutely amazing massages. The acupuncture is also very good. They like to recommend a balance between Eastern and Western ideas about holistic health and medicine, and I like how they combine them to give what I think is a clearer picture overall than either could do on its own.< /review>

<Text>I had previously left a positive review for Roberto but he no longer works here. In my opinion it’s a big lost for this establishment. He was really good. I was willing to give the other masseurs a try and was even willing to purchase their packages offered but the receptionist gave me a hard time. I had previously purchased a Groupon that I didn’t realize expired. Groupon states the value never expires and the merchant is responsible to the purchaser for the care and quality of service. I tried applying the value towards the same service plus additional sessions but was told I couldn’t. Overall, doesn’t make any sense, not pleased with treatment and will not be coming back.</Text>< Pictures>

<resp>{'time': 1550704020602, 'text': "We appreciate your review, but are disappointed that you did not take in to consideration that we honored 2 groupon promos from you in less than a years time, when our voucher clearly states that we only accept 1-per customer every 12 months.  We were even going to accept the 3rd groupon, but when you arrived at our office, you presented us with an expired groupon.  Groupon's policy states we are to honor the price you paid for the groupon and apply it to one of our REGULAR priced services (not another discounted service).   Per this policy, we offered you the $35 towards our REGULAR priced hour massage, but you did not want to do that, you wanted to apply it toward another discounted package of massages.\nFYI:  Groupons are marketing tools for businesses, and if we accepted them non-stop we would go out of business.  We actually lose money on these promos, as Groupon gets the bulk of the discounted rate you pay them.  We are truly sorry we were unable to accommodate your request this time, but I believe we went above and beyond in your case.  Yours in Health!  Dr. Karen"}< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dd2768be9473ab:0xbf94e383c3e439b6</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I have been there during daytime, very, very nice and clean and we'll taken care of. I'm sure the big baseball field has nothing to do with that though. Out playing with my suicidal drone one afternoon and I look around and there's a boy in a base-a-ball uni looking at me. Let's do the time warp again! No, no. Anyway I asked if he was going to play a game that day. Yes he said, and your in center field! No way dude, I didn't even have a glove! Told him look, I'm busy picking up drone pieces and no one his size is going to hit to deep center field and if they do, it's a home run anyway! A couple crashes later he said bye as there must have been 3outs or my deep center reasoning made sense. Picked up pieces of drone and booked it as fog was rolling in. I did see one person waving, I wavied back, hope he hit a homer at his next time at bat.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>poor customer service - they don't honor appointment times. it is first come first serve regardless of your app time. Worse, they advise you to wait in a crowded place for longer than a reasonable amount of time despite covid risks.< /Review>< Pics>

< review>
Worst hair cut I have ever gotten!! I am not going back ever again!! After going for 1 year a Latina woman fairly older woman cut my hair (didn’t catch her name) and did the worst job ever!! The other ladies are amazing but she just ruined it for me, she doesn’t know how to cut hair what so ever. On to a new place.<//review>

<Date>1548815984921</Date><rate>3< /rate><text>It's a hit or miss with this location for me. I've gone for a monthly hair cut (low fade and a trim) for almost 6 months now and I have been open to any stylist. I can say for sure that there are at least 3 stylists I'd never use again (one took an actual shave to the back of my neck which resulted in painful in-grown hairs and new scars) and another got into an actual argument with me about how I should style/change the way I maintain my own hair.

The location is clean, atmosphere is generally friendly, and for the price, it's a decent cut. The solution is simple--I know need to take down the names of the stylists I trust rather than offering up my hair as a beta test to anyone willing.< /text>< pictures>

Don’t come here if you want an undercut hairstyle. Both ladies had no idea what that was and the one cutting my hair went by directions. If you want a specific hairstyle by name, make sure the person knows it by name. Never coming here again. Don’t make this mistake.<//Text>

Poor communication from the staff to customers. Very rude. Never going back. Would not recommend if you care about customer service. Please train workers and staff to communicate to their customers better, thank you :)< /review>

Simple: 0 on the side, 4 on top, keep the front long.
Reality: 0 on the side, 4 on top, buzz cut all round.
If you want a good haircut then don't come here, if you do, ask for someone other than Ms. Kurtz.</Text>

They have a hard time understanding and communicating with customers.

Requested a 3 on the side and two fingers length on top.  Absolutely did not want a buzz cut.

Result was 3 on the side, with less than a finger on top, which is a really, really long way to get a buzz cut.</Text>

<review>I am a patient here and I LOVE this place. It is new, clean, and the doctor who sees me is amazing. I know they are training doctors but I feel that Dr. whang is already better than any doctor I’ve seen in the past 10 years. He is so polite, professional, genuinely concerned, listens to everything I have to say, he takes his time... I can go and on . After I see him, I guess the supervising doctor comes in as well to go through what the training doctor already went through with me so it’s like I’m being seen by TWO DOCTORS. It’s amazing! I feel completely and thoroughly taken care of. Thank god I found this place with SAC health, and I do not miss Dignity Health AT ALL.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>I went in for a filling on March 16 ,2021 for my lower back tooth. During the procedure Dr Shakespeare was talking to his assistant the entire time. About none and work related issues. When I tried to floss in between my teeth I was not able to. So I made a appointment to be seen March 19 ,2021. My appointment was scheduled at 7:15 I arrived on time. The dental assistant did my x rays  in a timely manner. However, I was not seen by the doctor till 7:50. Once Dr Shakespeare looked at my x-rays  he doubted anything was wrong. I told Dr that I felt a sharp pain in between my teeth. So he proceeded to use a mental strip to attempt to create a opening in between. The problem is that didn't work,  so he used a drill.  He stated it wouldn't cause pain but it did! His excuse for it being painful was that water function on the drill was on. I told Dr to numb my mouth before proceeding to drill in between my teeth. Dr Shakespeare then told me he didn't have time and that he had other patients. He also said that my appointment was only scheduled for 15 minutes. And that If I wanted to be numb I would have to come in for another appointment. I told him that he need to finish the job because I was in pain. He finally decided to numb me.  And  did not return back in 5 minutes like I was told. So I went to the receptionist, and told her my situation. I was sent back again,  and  Dr fixed it so now I can floss. ALTHOUGH AT THE END OF MY TREATMENT HE MADE A COMMENT. ABOUT CHICKEN AND BEEF GETTING STUCK IN BETWEEN MY TEETH. AND HE PUT EMPHASIS ON THE CHICKEN PART! OVERALL, DR SHAKESPEARE SEEMS LIKE A GOOD DENTIST BUT HE IS NOT HE RUSHES DURING DENTAL TREATMENT. AND HE ACTS AS IF HE DOES NOT HAVE TIME FOR HIS PATIENT'S.</review>< pictures>

<Review>I'm unable to eat much at all most definitely unable to eat a healthy diet fruit/veg because they removed most all my lower side teeth. I loved my jaw line I never would have agreed to it but I was told in order for ins to cover a lower partial I have to agree to extract them. But they lied, I cant eat and now have premature aging from severe bone loss, and they still are trying to make me pay for the partial at my nxt appointment 9th over 400.
I cant look at myself or take pics go out I WANT TO DIE. I feel they owe me a full set of implants for this epic lie that was done to me.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>My only issue is when calling to either schedule an appointment or speak with a nurse.  I'm always on hold for an hour+, longest I've been on hold was 2 hours before hanging up and making the trip down to the clinic.  Even after going out of my way to speak to the front desk in person (ONGYN department) the woman told me she was leaving for the day (4pm) and was unable to help me.  Other than the RIDICULOUS waiting times I've had no other issues.  Everyone for the most part is polite and helpful.< /review><gmapID>0x80c35333bcd37f91:0x8498a434d73522e1< /gmapID></record>

<Review>The clinic is beautiful and huge. I went to gynecology and saw Dr. Pruitt she is hands down the best OB doctor. She is caring and knows how to explain all the medical stuff really well. I never feel rushed and she is  very attentive with her patients. If you need an OB I definitely would recommend her 1,000% And if you have my chart the app she responds very quickly! It’s like texting your doctor!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

i received a referral for this place specifically, they refused to help me! they would not tell me why, they did not provide options or kindness. My insurance was confused and I was baffled that people would care this little about someone's health and safety. I needed them and they needed more money. I begged and they wanted more money. Disgusting and honestly should be shut down.</Text>

Very difficult to get an appointment.
Send message to Doctor and never get a response.
I’ve tried to place a complaint various times and phone just rings or it says voicemail full, or the one time they answered - they never called me back like they said they would.<//Review>

<Review>When Medical Professional Agency asked me to interview and work for Sac Health System. I felt blessed and honored to take a role here. Especially after hearing about their mission statement and vision. But it broke my heart after 2x they didn’t want to accept me because the agency that I was working under got me in a huge misunderstanding and miscommunication with SAC. SAC threw me under the bus and didn’t want to accept me even after I spoke to Chris Bryd (I believe that’s the HR manager there) regarding the situation and if I can finally start my first day there. SAC reached out to Medical Professional agency and told them that I need to stop contacting them and they no longer want me to work there when it wasn’t even my fault. Wow, great “mission and vision” statement saying on there website “SAC Health System is committed to reflect the healing ministry & love of Jesus Christ through healthcare, education, and partnerships that empower our communities to flourish. They didn’t even give me a second chance or at least hear me out. Jazzel who was suppose to start on my first day paperwork ignored and forward my calls. She didn’t even let me have a chance to speak on my behalf how the agency screwed me over. Thank you for letting me down and whoever else is next to even take a position there when it’s not even the fault of the candidate, ITS THE AGENCY YOU WORK WITH THATS MESSING EVERYTHING UP!!! So sad and heartbreaking.</Review>< Rating>

The facility seems professional but if you have any complications with your situation expect zero help or effort from the carefree employees or nurses. Everyone politely treats you as if you are not their problem, you will get no help resolving anything, they will give you the run around, transfer you to someone else’s voicemail, you will never get a call back. Just awful to have a medical clinic care so little about people< /Review>

My wife called for gynecology and was on hold for 15 minutes. When they finally answered they HUNG UP! So now she’s forced to wait again for someone to “answer her call In the order it was received.”

Update, after calling the third time because 2nd time said they were in a meeting, a lady answered and was very rude and seemed almost frustrated. My wife stayed hopeful just for the lady to tell her nothing of help. She kept getting mad because she couldn’t hear my wife due to problems and interference on there end.

Word of advise, please don’t be rude over the phone.<//Text>

<Review>I don’t understand how people getting treatment at a busy understaffed hospital can be expected to be seen before everyone else. That’s what I heard when I was there this afternoon. People there 30 minutes complaining. Some of you getting care for free. No, I see nothing wrong with getting help for free. Just don’t complain you didn’t get it your way.</Review>< pictures>

I would like to share my experiences and how great this place is . I've been here multiple times, I normally hate the doctors I always avoid going but this place has made me feel so comfortable.  All the staff has been super friendly. The  check in is fast and the wait has never been longer than 15 minutes to be seen. My doctor referred me to doctor Wongworat  hand specialist.  Overall I'm so happy with all the treatment.  A huge thanks to everyone here.< /text>

Nurses and doctors are always on time to see me and my baby. Whenever I have questions the doctors are there to help and they always  tell me ahead of time what needs to be done on my next visit at the end of my appointment. Plus the clinic inside are always clean and the security guys are always greeting people and are happy to give people water.

P.S. Everyone in the facility are very friendly and polite and they make me feel very comfortable at all of my appointments.</text>

Poor scheduling. More often then not I have scheduled an appointment only to be told i need to make another appointment days before my scheduled appointment. Only to wait weeks later. Everyone is polite enough but hardly concerned. Changing doctors due to it.< /Text>

<Review>Please read all .....******!!!!!!  I’m six weeks pregnant and last week I called and they gave me such a hard time to get an appointment for the ob. This receptionist named Carolina was so rude. And she kept hanging up on me. I had bad reception so I said give me a moment to get better signal and she just hung up. I called back and told her “ hello I was just on the phone and someone hung up on me” she said oh your the pregnant woman who wants an appointment right, well I couldn’t hear you and if I can’t hear you I’m not going to stay on the call. So immediately I was mad. And she would give me the run around. I have straight medical and on April 1 will have iehp and she said “we don’t except just straight medical so their for cant make you and appointment” so I called three other times to see maybe I’ll get another person on the phone and nope her again. But then I called and finally got someone else and she told me the same thing. So I called IEHP told them of how rude they were treating me and told them about them not excepting my straight medical and they told me their filing a report because they should except it and that made me very happy. I called yesterday and told them I put a complaint and all of a sudden an appointment opened up real quick and that’s not even a good thing because it’s with a primary doctor I need to see a ob. The receptionist said we need to confirm pregnancy and I told her I went to the hospital for pain and bloating in my stomach and they told me I’m 6 weeks pregnant and need to see my doctor. And she still said we need to confirm pregnancy. Im six and a half weeks pregnant I need to check on my baby don’t they understand their is a life growing inside me a baby I wanna check on. Make sure it’s okay. But just FYI to all my bad reviews. if you have IEHP please call the and complain for the bad job the receptionist are doing. This should not be a way to treat a pregnant woman. If they don’t like their jobs they should not be working there. I’m just so mad and disappointed with the service. My pediatrician for my two other angels never gives me this problem it’s probably just the ob/gym office.

Ps someone get back to me because I know their is a higher power then these so called receptionist they have working for them in the ob office. I will be calling IEHP once again on Monday to update them on this horrible treatment and I’ll be looking for another doctors office.</Review><time>1553951980514< /time></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
The worst place I have ever dealt with. By the time they let you have an OB appt you’re in the second trimester of pregnancy. I got sick of their red tape and found an OB who would see me within 2 weeks without all these stupid tests and referrals proving I’m pregnant.< /Review>

Big waste of my time, I'm 13 weeks pregnant the fact that the ob gyn section gave me the the run around, told me to go to family practice first to prove im PREGNANT. Then got to the obgyn section only so they do the SAME test to prove I'm pregnant AGAIN. Which makes no sense cuz THEY told me to go to family practice side to get tested. So I pay 40 dollar co pay just so they can check my vitals, not show me my baby's ultrasound or heart beat. Family practice side did an ultrasound, but told me " sorry my batteries are low on this monitor can't print out a picture  I am an employee at Loma Linda & I'm in disbelief & so disappointed in this office.< /Review>

<Text>Scheduling appointments is a headache! Your either put on hold for long periods at a time or they don't pick up. Your told they are full for the following month and to call back 2 weeks before month is over to schedule the next month and when you do they tell you they are full again...in other words,  good luck!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Such horrible receptionist i had called twice today 2 get seen sooner because my primary doctor told me too since i am 28 weeks pregnant and have a historia of preclampsia well my primary doctor was concern about my blood pressure and also diagnosed me with asthma i explained it to the receptionist and they were no help at all. Apart from that the doctors are very understanding and kind and listened so its dissapointing to see how the receptions are . By the way this was for my ob/gyn.</text>

My son and I currently go to the Sac Health clinic on G st. It is very professional and super clean. (That counts a lot) The doctors are very attentive and show interest in my son and I. They take the time to answer all the questions I have and come back with a solution for any issue I have. What I also like is that they have their own pharmacy in the facility. Which is amazing because dealing with other pharmacys has been such a hassle for me. The only problem I could say I have is the waiting time once your in the patient room. I have been there sometimes for about 2 or 3 hours, but I also keep in mind that it is a teaching facility and the medical students have to run everything past the attending and make their assessments with the attending. Other than that, whenever I need a referall or an ultrasound they handle all of that for me, and just give me a call when all is in order. I've had a good experience with them so far. All in all I love the care they provide.< /text>

I've read both good and bad reviews about SAC and their staff/doctor's and it sucks to read the negative ones because I have been fortunate enough to have nothing but positive comments. Their staff and doctor Perry have been nothing but helpful to me. I hope the people who has had a bad experience will soon experience a good one and change their mind regarding their staff.< /review>

The only reason why i give them 3 stars is because of the appointments. I keep calling to schedule an appointment for my kids and never have anything available. Now not even same day visit. I told one of the girls i needed an appt and since they didn’t have any her answer was “ if you may consider switching to another clinic” if i wanted to switch i would. I love the drs. And the clinic is good because of the drs not the receptionist. I love the place not receptionist. And like i said your child is sick just go to an ER or Urgent care here they won’t get you in. I don’t understand why they are overbooking so ridiculous. Hope they fix that.< /Text>

<Review>OK, not a good place to be. They are very unorganized. One doctor says one thing the other says another, who can you trust ? They have had plenty of time to correct their issues. So at this point and time they are unorganized on purpose and who knows how long this has been going on. Other people have notice that they are unorganized. For me how hard is to to just READ a patient's medical record? How hard is it to scan the medical records into the computer ? And if the computer is not working FIX the problem. When a medical staff cannot be on the same level of understanding this is DANGEROUS and can harm the patient. I am going to REPORT them to the medical authorities because NO ONE is gonna play with my health and just get a way with it. I had a doctor who cause me pain by injuring me at this SAC , long story short Now I have another doctor who is just clueless and this clueless may not be her fault if someone did not put it into the medical record BEFORE she know about my current situation. Dude to my current situation i cannot just leave now, BUT after my medical situation is over I am leaving. Seems like this place is getting worse and worse. There ER is bad, There Gyno is bad and even this SAC clinic is not all that great is all part of the Loma Linda System. Different locations BUT same Loma Linda System. Some people in this system may be nice people, but please avoid this place to save your life.< /Review><gmapID>0x80c35333bcd37f91:0x8498a434d73522e1</gmapID><Resp>None</Resp><pics>None< /pics>< Date>

< review>
The short time I've been going to the clinic has been a great experience so far. Staff is prompt , and always nice, and helpful. They refered me to a specialist for my gullbladder  surgery, and I didn't care for the first one, so they were happy to try another. Well I just had my surgery on Dec.15, 2018, and now recovering, with my family helping me get well, thank God. It's been a while sence I've been to the clinic, because I had to wait a couple of months to get my surgery after switching surgeons , because the new surgeon was on vacation when I scheduled my appointment with him. Tomorrow morning I will be getting an appointment as soon as poss., because I have ran out of my pain medication, and the surgeon is out of town again, and I really need them. Only because when they were doing my surgery they had some issues and had to cut me all the way open, just got staples out today, and happy about that, and scared because I didn't think it was time to take them out. I will close on that, and just say the Sac clinic is a good clean always, nice staff and doctors, as well as their referrals to other doctors, a blessing all the way around. Thanks Sac clinic for careing.</review>

I am giving them 1 star, due to the fact that the office is probably the nicest and cleanest doctor's office in all of San Bernardino. I would give zero stars, if I could, for quality of care.  First off, the appointment staff is very rude and unprofessional. Some of the nurses at the office need an attitude adjustment. Some, not all! The doctor that I saw made me feel like I had to choose which one of my disorders did I want treated. My asthma, my pain or my anxiety? Um, how about treating them all?... And if you couldn't, why not refer me to someone/people who could? I was supposed to have a lung function test and was told by the rude check out clerk, I COULD NOT come back until it was done. I called my insurance company two weeks after my appointment and found out NO authorization was ever submitted, and this was a week and a half before my next scheduled appointment! Bottom line, this office and especially Dr. Lucas, need a LOT of help and professional training. Just because you have a nice office, doesn't mean you can skimp out on quality of care.

UPDATE:
I gave them another chance to help me.
First of all, I got my authorization for my lung function test, AFTER I wrote my first review. Coincidence? Probably not. . .
I had a chest x ray done and had to wait a week to get my results. When I requested the results through their portal, as they suggest, my initial request was ignored. I had to send FIVE messages, to two different doctors, before they responded. Well, when I went back to their office I was seen by another doctor at the clinic. After waiting over an hour and a half to be seen, I explained my health issues to the new doc, a med student and the attending doctor. I had a better experience this time, with regards to the new doctor. However, I was told I needed to go back the following week for a follow up. This time, I waited less than 15 mins to be seen. I explained to the doctor that the side effects of the medication she gave me for my asthma, were horrible. I had bone/joint pain, extreme fatigue, it exacerbated my asthma symptoms and caused me severe pain. I was told by another attending doctor, "I don't think you have given the medication enough time to work. You should stay on it". WHAT!? They completely disregarded my issues with the medicine. Oh and they initially tried to convince me that my asthma was in fact my anxiety. WRONG! When they finally did their job, they listened to my lungs, and heard me wheezing. To top it all off, they sent medications to my pharmacy, that I had already told them I could not take, and blamed it on the pharmacy for filling them, and ME for picking them up! I reached out to their "customer service", several times to discuss my complaints, and have yet to receive a response.  I have switched doctors and notified my insurance of their practices. Enough is enough!

P.s. whoever is giving the responses to the reviews, if you could have someone follow up, that would be great, since I can never seem to get anyone to contact me. I used your website, emailed through yelp and have called several times. NO ANSWER!< /text>

< Review>
I was seen back in October of 2016 and was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. That same day I went to have my lab work done in the same facility and 2 weeks later I went back in for my results. Dr. Perry notified me that all my blood work had been lost EXCEPT for my Vitamin D results. She told me I have a Vitamin D Deficiency and was prescribed me Vitamin D2 50,000 UI One Capsule Once A Week for the Next 8 Weeks. After the first dose, I had an over dose and was in the Emergency Room. I was suppose to be given a supplement along with the Vitamin D2 Prescription. As a result of the over dose I now have Liver Damage and My Vitamin D Deficiency continues to drop even lower. I have tried numerous times to get in contact with Dr. Perry and Dr. Woodruff ( who signed off on Prescription) to discuss this issue. I left a message with the receptionist and did not receive a call back until March of 2017 (5 Months Later).</Review>

This facility is racist, they lack compassion and they do not listen to patients. I'm changing medical groups entirely.< /Review>

< Review>
Came upon this gem of a restaurant while walking around waiting on a table at a place on the main street. It has a huge out door patio, is dog friendly and had no wait. Could this be too good to be true? The food was amazing! Everything we got was delicious, and you could tell was fresh and house made.The service was friendly and fast. I would definitely come back, new favorite spot!</Review>

<rate>5</rate><text>Tried The Bridge on Third for Happy Hour. I had a couple of Yorkshire Sliders she had the Proper Chips with Cheese Sauce, onions, and bacon. The sliders are mini burgers with Chesse Sauce and Onions on Yorkshire Pudding "Buns". Both were delicious. Had an English IPA. Very tasty as well. Nice place. Friendly staff. We will be back.

Wait staff super nice. Dad enjoyed the fish and chips and I liked my hamburger, they even had mashed peas which impressed my mom. The band that night was awesome. Hope they stay in business that building has a lot of turn over. Parking is easy< /Review>

What a great place! English Pub style. The food and beer selections are great, and the service is excellent. The inside dining/bar area's is really done well. The outside area is mostly covered with a pet friendly grass area. Had a wonderful time. You won't be sorry you made this choice! I had their burger on a fresh home made English muffin, delicious! My wife is Vegan an had a great salad. I can't wait to try more of the menu!<//Review>

The staff is super friendly and helpful, the food was really good as well. I ordered the pork belly Mac and cheese. It was very good. I just recommend eating it hot because as it cools down it’s not as great but still worth ordering. Awesome atmosphere as well. Def recommend checking out<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Love this place! It's my favorite pub in town. They always have something fun going on in the evenings and their large outdoor patio is dog friendly. All the food I have tried is delicious, and I have yet to find ANY other place that serves pretzel balls and beer cheese sauce as good as this place. Always fresh and hot and soft.</review>

Proper English food with solid pub appetizers. Service is spectacular and they have a wonderful selection of British beers on tap (yes, that means Scottish and Irish as well). Great atmosphere and lots of things going on like trivia nights and live music. I felt like I was back in London again!<//Review>

This place is super cool! They have great food, and a good selection of drinks. I hardly ever drink beer, and when I do (here), it's limited edition beer from the UK. The owner suggested it....so glad he did, and that I tasted it. So worth it, as it was delicious. The live music is good. This place is perfect for going solo to wind down, or to go with friends. DON'T BE DISCOURAGED IF THERE'S AN EVENT GOING I FRONT OF THE CITY-HALL, THESE GUYS ARE STILL OPEN.</Text>

We really enjoyed the Open Mic here.  Wednesdays from 6:30 to 9ish.  Lots of great Musicians and great support from the crowd.  Good was tasty too.  I'll grab a brew next time I am there and see how that goes... I'm sure it will be great as well.<//Text>

GREAT food in the style of an English pub, but with a 'down home' atmosphere. Jeff the totally hands-on chef ,prepares EVERYTHING from scratch and every item on the menu shouts: QUALITY. Portions are huge...prices are so reasonable. Live music and theme nights add to the experience. Don't miss this place...you will LOVE it<//text>< pics>

<Review>The Fish and Chips was outstanding - literally some of the best I have ever had. We tried a Scotch Egg (a soft boiled egg, wrapped in ground sausage, rolled in bread crumbs, and then deep fried) and we loved it! Nice ambiance, a convenient location, and good service. We'll be back again.< /Review>< pics>

Great place to relax and enjoy a fantastic meal and an ice cold beverage. The recent additions to the menu are delicious. Especially enjoy the spicy curry. Wow!< /text>

Awesome place, pet friendly. I get the Shepard's Pie everytime and a Newcastle draft beer. Can't beat it. Also, it's pretty quiet because it's off the main road but definitely worth the trip.< /Review>

Fish and chips were amazing, but was moreso amazing than that was the service. World Cup game, England’s playing, wall to wall jam packed, you’d expect service to suffer. On the contrary, drinks and orders were coming out like clock work! Love the service, love the food, love the beer and the amazing staff. See you when the EPL kicks off.</Review>

<Text>Friendly staff, good food, and great drinks!  This spot is of the main road but don't miss it.  All their for food is fresh, delicious, and served in generous portions.  Plus they have Magners Cider.  We love the pretzel balls and, of course, the fish and chips.  Fire pits outside and a Cornhole set up on the side, making this a good hang out spot.< /Text>< Pics>

Since then, we've launched a lunch menu at $8.95 a plate, plus a great happy hour menu. We've also improved our timing on food, so we really hope you'll come back soon to give us a second opportunity to better serve you and your guests. Thank you for taking the time to give us a review, it is great appreciated."}</response>

Took some customers here for lunch today. The food was great, but was a little on the pricey side. And it seemed like it took a long time to get our food. I think they just opened. I'll give it another shot in a few weeks.</Text>

Never got to try the food. Waiter told us to choose a seat. My wife and I sat down, had to yell at each other over the blasting music. Waited for 10 minutes, no service, so we left. Too loud. Everyone's food looked great, but it was just too loud so we took advantage of the slow service and jumped ship.<//review>

<text>This small business is definitely cute and local to the Irvine area. Close by UCI, it is not a surprise when you see local college students here. The atmosphere pre-COVID was definitely lively and youthful.

Due to COVID, they take necessary precautions with their masks and making sure that orders are solely to-go. Although outside seating used to be open, they closed it down due to the purple tier.

I remember coming here with my friends before COVID and it definitely brings back nostalgia! I recommend their egg rolls! The service was good but my only one star down was because the pho wasn't as good as I anticipated (MAYBE IT COULD HAVE BEEN JUST THAT DAY HEHE)</text>< resp>

<text>First order took 20 min and was the incorrect order. I was told in five minutes I'd get my correct order. I did get the correct order but it had terrible quality meat, the pork was so fatty I couldn't eat a lot of it. Maybe you could chew through all of that fat if it was actually charbroiled and not rushed out in minutes? (Item is B1 charbroiled pork vermicelli)<//text>< Pics>

Love, love this place! Their food and service have been consistently excellent for years. I always get their soup if I stop here. For takeout, my favorite is BBQ beef with rice.< /Review>

Great spot for Pho! Gets very crowded on cold/rainy days when everyone is craving pho so on those days highly recommend to get here way before the lunchtime rush.  We come here quite often and have never been disappointed.  I also like ordering their beef tenderloin either with rice or salad as pictured.  This place is legit!</text>

< review>
Delicious pho and my absolute favorite Vietnamese iced coffee in all of OC. I'm not sure what they do but it's so smooth and tasty! It is a slightly higher price than you can get it for at other places but for the premium I think it's worth it. Although I would recommend asking for little to no ice.

The waiters are pretty chill but I wouldn't come here expecting high class table service. It feels more like a quick bite to eat place than a true to heart sit down so take that as you will. It doesn't bother me so no harm no foul!< /review>

<Text>They have great options for vegans. I got the pan-fried tofu with rice noodles. It was delicious! They have soups, salads and rice dishes that can be made vegan. Just make sure to ask that they don't use beef broth, fish or oyster sauce in the dish. Tell them to make it vegan. Great food and service!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

< review>
I came in last weekend because I was in desperate need of pho and spring rolls!! I love this restaurant for it's lovely, clean  appearance, happy cheerful staff, and delightfully light, and fresh tasting food. The spring rolls practically melt in your mouth they're so good! The broth for the pho is super clear and has a fantastic hint of lemon grass. I love that they set you up with a side plate of fresh herbs such as basil, cilantro, mint, sprouts, etc. Everything tastes farm to table fresh!! I also happened to notice the banner that was near the back that states that another one of my favorite places, Ha Long, is also owned by the same family who own Photasia. This made me super happy!! I had no idea of the relationship of the two places, but now that I do, I fully support both for providing such nice, quality Vietnamese food. Thank you!!!< /review>

<text>You can get better Pho elsewhere. I thought their broth is pretty bland and it's quite pricey even though their bowls aren't that big. Other places are more generous, more flavorful and cheaper.< /text>< userid>

Totally yummy!  Pho is always on point but my favorite is the charbroiled beef over yellow rice.   Heavenly!  Quick service... but if you're going for lunch,  get the before noon to beat the rush.< /Review>

Update: We got take out, and they are doing a great job with safety measures for COVID-19. Food still tastes delicious.

The chicken in the broiled chicken and garlic rice is very tender. The soup base for the pho is seasoned well. They give a good amount of toppings for the pho. Serving size is decent/expected for the price.<//review>

This place has been my go-to pho place for the eight years I’ve lived in Irvine. Plenty of seating and very fast service. The pho is very good, but their dishes are equally tasty and well priced. Worth the wait if there is one.< /Review>

<Text>This place is good. The Pho is nice and hot when served. However they don't serve that much like other places. I been to many Pho places and they all have pretty good servings except for this place. They serve less then other places. But over all it's good. Good flavor.< /Text><GmapID>0x80dcdd946b17bee5:0x423060e8b05c6d2d</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Had the shrimp pho & fried rice with stir fry veggies. Soup base was very good...not too greasy. It had just the right seasoning but I think  I could taste some MSG though. Price is on par with other Pho places around here. Service was good too. Very good for South OC.< /Review><GmapID>0x80dcdd946b17bee5:0x423060e8b05c6d2d</GmapID><username>Bobby Doan</username>< Pictures>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>This is our favorite Pho place in Irvine. The service is great, efficient and reasonably friendly. They have great egg rolls and spring rolls and the pho is very flavorful. I've seen them changing out the bones in the broth through the door, so I know it is real beef bone broth. In the summer the vermicelli noodle dishes are cool and refreshing. Grilled pork is a winner on rice or vermicelli. Finally, I personally love their iced tea. I know, small thing to love, but it is always just right strength, not too strong or weak, perfect without sugar, and they keep it refilled.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Text>First time and last time here.

TLDR: Rude manager and dry food.

Garlic butter rice chicken: tried since I love this dish and was looking for a decent one close by. Both my friend and I ordered one, and both dishes 1) had rice that was very dry and 2) didn't have a smidge of garlic flavor.

When we asked the manager if we got the wrong order, he first ignored us. When he was asked again, he only listed the ingredients of the dish......not answering the question (not lost in translation.) Ok, then see above points about the dish being dry and had no garlic.

Food here is pricier than average for the area.

+1 star for the kind, attentive eldery gentleman who was our waiter.<//Text>< Time>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>3 and a 1/2 stars. PhoTasia is still the best pho spot in Irvine but that's not saying much. When I have craving for pho and don't want to drive extra miles to little saigon, this is the place I go. I order Pho Special and it usually comes out well. Broth has good deep flavor, their noodles aren't overly cooked, and their basil, mint, bean sprouts are relatively fresh. It gets crowded on a rainy or overcast day.< /Text>< pics>

<review>Pho Tasia is a clever name that combines Pho and Taste.  It also conjures up images of a magical experience from Disney’s Fantasia.

Do the food taste magical?  Not quite, but I vouch it is the best Vietnamese food near UCI - unless we drive to Westminster or San Gabriel (search for Golden Deli).  It is much better than nearby Phans55 and Pho So 1, which are average.  Pho Tasia family also run Pho Ba Co and Ha Long, which are good too.

Everything on the menu tasted great - pho (hot noodle soup) or bun (cold vermicelli salad); grilled beef, chicken, pork, pork chop, or shrimp; steamed egg meatloaf, fried egg rolls, cold spring rolls, various dessert drinks, and even the fish sauce.

Prices increased $1-2 in last few years, but they are still reasonable in Irvine standard.  I like the value platter which include a little bit of everything.  Tips: If you order any rice plate, you may add $1 to get a lemonade.

I recommend you also try Thuan Kieu Noodle & Grill.  They specialize in broken rice and grilled meats.  They opened a new locate next to Chipotle on Irvine Blvd at Culver Dr.

Enough food fantasy.  I need to get back to work, so I can pay my food bill.  :-p</review><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

Go-to place for pho. Try the pho with the barbecue pork or chicken - they literally bring you a plate of grilled meat to throw on top of your soup!</Text>

Nice little Park.
Good for Skateboarding.
I found street parking on Palmer.
Not sure if there is more parking elsewhere.

The Skatepark has some fun features.
A quarter pipe section, half of a bowl, a rail, some stairs sets. Some very tall ledges. The Quarter pipes/ half of a bowl section is maybe 4 feet tall? Gets to maybe 5 feet? Smooth and Well made.
Not sure who made it.

Worth checking out if You are in the neighborhood.

There are bathrooms here.
I don't think there are lights.
Come check it out!< /review>

<Review>The park itself is nice, but unless you live in the area it really isn't practical to visit because parking is treacherous. It really dampens the experience, especially if you're there for a party. Why have two large spaces to rent out, if there isn't enough parking for the guests of even one of those spaces? Also, the playground and skate park are too far and blocked from view of the picnic areas, so you can't monitor kids if you're at the tables.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Text>My son loves the skate park area. I've held my sons 1st birthday party here as well very reasonable prices to reserve the party area. Very secured with clean restrooms. Large field area for soccer, football, volleyball and it also has basketball courts. A toddler pool included in the summers and slides, swings, play area upgraded.</Text>< pictures>

<review>For the first time, I was invited for a Birthday Party in a Park, actually we enjoyed it very much, it was fun to spend the day in the open green park,  a lot of amusements for the kids. Swings, sliding, skateboards, basketball courts, BBQ drills, and water faucets next to your table, clean restrooms, So, Nice place to spend the day out with the Family and Friends.< /review>< Response>

The pharmacist was so kind in accommodating my needs. I was glad that the medicine I wanted to buy was available and it was at a very reasonable cost. They have a lot of products that are no longer sold in stores near me. The service was fast as well. I would recommend this store.<//Text>

If I could if zero stars, I would. I was misinformed by CVS pharmacy about my birth control prescription. The pharmacy informed to me on multiple accounts that they would be able to transfer my medication from Rite-Aid with a few days. I waited 3 weeks. Each week I would call back asking for the status of my medication, in which a pharmacist would tell me that my medication would be in stock within 48 hours of my call. An automated message would inform me that my medication was ready for pickup by the end of the day. Today, when I called to ask for the status of my medication, the pharmacist told me that they don't carry that medication anymore. It took 3 weeks for this information to be told to me. I have four more days until I need to renew my medication and now I have to transfer my medication back to Rite-Aid. Medication should not be taken lightly. I am very disappointed in CVS.</text>

Disgusting environmental waste from a greedy corporation. Wish cvs in general was charged fines by the government  for the gigantically long mostly useless coupon lists that are generated with pretty much every transaction.

<Review>This CVS is horrible. I can never get in touch with anyone and they hang up on you when you try to call in. Can never get a hold of anyone at the pharmacy. I was on hold for over 40 min. Then I tried calling the front of the store and they hung up on me multiple times.</Review></record></dataset><record>

The staff are all very kind and helpful but the telephone system REALLY needs to be addressed. I've been on hold for 45 min earlier today and almost an hour now. They need to have either a call back system so you don't have to be on hold or have a CSR designated for phones. Also that HORRIBLE piano hold music needs to be removed. I rather not hear any music than this.</Text>

< Review>
Not as good as it was previously!  Think they are getting too big and are losing good staff as well.  Had a bad experience ordering a refill for a RX that the gal was sending to my Dr two days ago.  I alerted my Doc's office that the request would be coming in.  As of late today two days later -- no response from CVS.  So I called and got a rather abrupt fellow who couldn't tell me why my request didn't go thru but he would look it up -- then he hung up on me!!!  I have another option for RX needs and that is my local Pavilions pharmacy -- not as convenient as CVS but may Really need to possibly move all scripts there!!<//Review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>I mean. The pharmacy is actually the worst. I wish there was another option or another game in town besides them. They never receive my Rx and as a result it’s never filled timely. They can never explain why it’s not ready or why I have to wait when I should be able to just walk in and get it. You know, like at any pharmacy.  It’s troubeling how high the level of incompetence is from their call in system to sometimes how miserable and unhappy the people are that work here.</Review><username>Tim Smith</username><time>1554678427394< /time>< Resp>

Good service always have things in stock. Staff is friendly although they are short staffed at the moment they are trying their best to give good quality customer service. Don't believe what these other people are saying except for the parking it's atrocious. You'll  end up waiting ages for a parking spot here</Review>

<Text>I've stood in a two-person pharmacy line for half an hour; walked in to find the line two dozen people long; called and been left on hold for twenty minutes, only to hang up and call back to be left on hold for another twenty minutes, only to be told the store is closing; been pleaded with multiple times by pharmacists that the place is understaffed.

The staff is perfectly friendly under trying circumstances; thus the 2 stars.</Text><Name>Joshua Christian</Name><userid>101414999607317096928< /userid>< pictures>

They never have enough staff to serve the line of customers with only one person on the register most of the time. If you can find another pharmacy close to you, go there. Unfortunately it's my closest. CVS also bombard you with automated texts and phone calls about various medications/flu shots etc etc. I've taken to changing my number and not giving it to them to stop the multiple daily calls from them. Just generally bad!</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

I'm holding for the pharmacy for over 31 minutes.  That's terrible service.  And, I was previously promised (twice) that I'd be texted to let me know when the prescription was available for pickup.  That NEVER happened.  Again, terrible service, promises NOT kept!!<//review>

<Text>This is the worst cvs or any pharmacy I've ever been to. They huge lines constantly with slow and rude service. Every time I call I get put on hold for twenty to thirty minutes. Then this last week I dropped off a prescription and they didn't have it in stock they ordered it told me it would arrive the next day I called the next day after a thirty min wait I  was told on the phone that it was there I went there and all of a sudden they didn't have it nor did they have a record of me ordering it so after no apology or explanation I had to reorder it only to wait now 2 more days when I was going to be out of my meds that night. These people we lazy and rude for the most part w the exception of one young lady who did go out of her way for me to save me money. Do not come here< /Text>< pics>

1. We went to CVS Pharmacy at Beverly Blvd. & La Cienega this pm after visiting Urgent Care dated 11/7/2016...Very Poor Costumer Service. We felt ignored & discriminated
2. My friend went to pick up her BP Medication after visiting Cedars Urgent Care for Hypertension.
3. We went to CVS to pick up her meds & mine at 1545 PM. The manager said that there is no medication for my friend  in the computer & he even phoned urgent care. He promised to call them again. We waited & waited...
4. We phoned urgent care again & gave the manager the Urgent Care Doctor's number.
5. We stayed for another 45 mins,but no calls were made. And because my friend is already c/o of severe headache probably due to high BP. I had to approach the manager to ask for a follow up response
6. The manager said he phoned Urgent Care already, but didn't tell us, while we were waiting for more that 1 hour.
7. We waited for another 10 mins, but to our dismay, we had to call Urgent Care again & they denied getting another call from the CVS manager. So the CVS manager lied to us. Urgent Care claimed that the prescription was faxed already
8. Unfortunately we were at the CVS from 1545 till 1715. For sick people waiting that long.. it's not very comfortable.
ISSUES & CONCERNS:
1.Don't let your costumers wait for long hours. It's not a pleasant feeling, especially when you really feel so sick. Send them home instead  & call them when meds are ready.
2. Don't lie. It's totally unacceptable especially from a CVS manager (Mr. Chad Tamasriro).
3. Don't tell us you're busy. All of us have our own busy moments at work. At least talk to your costumer for an update. Don't tell us "you got your prescription now! What are you complaining about"< /Text>

I live across the street from this CVS.
This is a predominately Jewish area, yet CVS does not have appropriate Chanukah merchandise.  Every year, since CVS took this over from Longs, I've complained about this recurring phenomenon.  There are asles of Christmas "stuff" and the end of one isle is the token Chanukah "stuff".  Chanukah is in 3 weeks, while Christmas is in 7 weeks, but that doesn't mean anything.  There is no wrapping nor ribbon, nor tags; only some candles, candy bowls and a couple of foil decorations.  Bad store management and bad corporate attitude.<//review>

The young lady who took my prescription initially said they would need to contact my doctor to have it approved, only to find out that was wrong information after I took it upon myself to call my insurance. I ended up waiting nearly 2 hours, and she never even acknowledged her error. I have visited this pharmacy before with mediocre service, but will surely not return again.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>An extremely large CVS for the area. However, it was the worst parking as well. People are coming and going and fighting for spots, it's a pretty terrible set up.

Store was a little dingy though, and had few items per each item, so not a lot to choose from.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Natalie is incredible! If you are looking for a place to go get Botox or fillers I would highly suggest you book with her! She knows just how much to use and is not someone who will overfill or overdo a look. She wants to make sure you have natural, flawless, and perfect results. She is so nice, has a great approach, and leaves you feeling like you're fast friends. So thankful I found her!< /Review><Name>Channing McCabe< /Name>< response>

<review>Botox and filler from the Queen 👑 Lynn B. What a kind soul she is I feel lucky to have found her. I am a grandmother and thanks to Lynn people don’t believe me! Not only does she give me perfect lips & no wrinkles ,she helps me with my skincare regiment. She is amazing ! Here is a recent with almost healed lips.
I’ve done facials with Maggie and it was also amazing. I love how both ladies were so knowledgeable yet warm and kind. Everyone in here was friendly and kind. Checkin was easy and fast during Covid. I have no complaints.</review><userid>116702854745505230663< /userid><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

This was my first time getting any type of lip fillers injected. I was so nervous going in but I ended up going with Natalie as my injector and I think that she is extremely comforting and amazing with people she made me feel so comfortable and so excited she explained everything super thoroughly and she asked for exactly what I wanted and gave me exactly what I wanted and I am so happy with everything I could’ve not asked for a better experience! All of the staff there was extremely nice as well as one of the staff members Bobby she was so sweet and so nice and made everything so much easier to book my appointment for my follow up and they were also very thorough with the care instructions! Will definitely recommend and definitely go again !< /review>

<Text>This review covers my first initial consult appointment and my actual treatment appointment at this location.
From my first appointment with Natalie Gillen, I was absolutely 100% confident I chose the right person. I had never had any type of aesthetic treatments and I don't really think I needed much. I hoped and prayed I would get someone who was honest and wasn't pushy about needing more than I actually did.
If that is what you are looking for, then Natalie is your girl. She is knowledgeable, experienced, down to earth and so so friendly. She is honest and direct. I ended up getting a few units of Botox with her and I loved how well she explained things to me with  maps of facial muscles, possible reactions and outcomes.. It is important that in this kind of stuff your medical practitioner-keeps it real!
I think it is really important as a consumer to understand that as amazing and incredible as the medical practitioners are at Skin Spirit, they don't have a magic wand. Be realistic with your expectations, be thankful that people like Natalie and the others at Skin Spirit, will tell you what can be done right and what can't. Often people don't like to be told no, and forget that someone is actually looking in their best interest because they are REAL EXPERTS. It shows they take great pride in their work and that integrity is everything to them.
I know this review and referring my friends to Natalie will bite me in the butt someday because her availability will be too full and it'll be harder for me to get in to see her. But she truly is a gem of a person, extremely professional and deserves the kudos for everyone to see.< /Text>< pictures>

My compliments to Lead Esthetician, Amber.
Yesterday, I received the greatest derma-planing facial EVER. My skin is usually very sensitive, feisty & moody. That fact you would have never known after seeing my skin post facial... could have modeled for Vogue magazine cover immediately post facial. I drove 2 hours to see Amber after recommendation from my neighbor (who is a professional model). I will be back soon. Thank-you, Amber & Palo Alto SkinSpirit for an awesome outcome & your TLC!!<//text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>I visited this place during the time of covid. The medical assistant i was working with seemed to have difficulty breathing. First I thought it might be due to wearing mask. But she actually blew her nose in the middle of my facial. Although she washed her hands before continuing the procedure, i still felt extremely uncomfortable during the rest of my appointment. Shouldn’t all the employees get checked for Covid symptoms everyday before work?
Plus I was not satisfied with the service. My face got irritated and broke out terribly after the facial.</text>< pics>

<text>My practitioner was Melissa! I’m so glad it was her, she’s extremely knowledgeable and made me feel comfortable through my whole treatment! It was my first time getting a chemical peel and did feel a little nervous at first but Melissa made sure to talk me through what she was doing and that helped me not be as nervous since, she explained what I should expect.

The office is very nice and comfortable, and the prices are reasonable for the quality of service. SkinSpirit came highly recommended, and as I’ve had laser before and I can say it’s a great place to have it done.< /review>< GmapID>

<review>I had an excellent experience getting an IPL facial with Melanie. This is my second treatment and the results have been very good; it's greatly reduced the appearance of sun damage on my face. I'll definitely be coming back. Melanie is great--very professional and knowledgeable and she does a terrific job of checking in to make sure I'm comfortable.< /review>< pictures>

<review>I've gone twice for a facial, both times with Lisa. She is excellent! She explains every step of the facial to you and lets you know what she is applying to the face and why. It is a very relaxing experience and afterwards my face feels fresh and tight.

This most recent time I met with Jessica for a consultation regarding cool sculpting and she was great! She was honest with me and informed me that she did not think cool sculpting was something I needed. So instead of having me waste hundreds of dollars she encouraged me to keep going to the gym and eating right.

I definitely recommend this place for any facial services.</review>< pictures>

<Text>Due to Covid-19, I was hesitant to make an appointment. I am very pleased that I did. I had been sheltering in place for 2-ish months now, so I felt safe but I wasn’t sure what measures they had it place for their clientele. I see Michelle Gonzales for Botox. She was practically in a hazmat suit when I walked in lol...eye protection, N-95 mask, hair protection, gloves, and head to toe gown! She told me she disinfects her room after each appointment. Before my appointment I had to use the bathroom but I had to wait because they disinfect the bathroom after each person uses it too! They have new HVAC filters in each room. On top of that they do a cleaning every 30 minutes of the entire facility. Oh! And they provide gloves and a mask for anyone who wants one! What else... oh, they don’t let anyone in until their appointment so there is no waiting area. Really felt safe in there... so glad I went because now it gives me an idea of what I should do when I reopen my office after summer.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I had such a great experience at SkinSpirit. It is always challenging to find a right skin care and I feel like they offer enough options to meet my needs. Melissa is super awesome. She is very knowledgeable and she kindly explains the details of each application so that I know what to expect while feeling safe & relaxed. After just one facial with her, I've been loving how my skin looks and feels. I'm already showing off my pearl-glowing face to my clients to recommend, and can't wait for my next appointment with Melissa.< /Review>

Actually made a significant improvement in skin tone and texture. Was my first time in any skincare clinic..never even had a facial. My friend suggested SkinSpirit when I noticed every get-together she looked younger.
I was lucky to get Jenny who was both very skillful and  very likeable. She guided me to the right treatment and didn't make me feel guilty for being a bit late. It was relaxing, painless with surprisingly good results.
My daughter said she'd never seen me with glowing skin and I looked years younger.
I'm over my fear of wasting time and money on my skin. It's well worth it and plan to follow up as needed. Highly recommended.<//text>

She answered all of my questions during the consultation and on the day I came back to receive treatment she made sure i was comfortable the whole time. I had such a pleasant experience! She even sent me home with a goodie bag. Also, SkinSpirit was about 1,000 less than Laser Away for CoolSculpting. I will definitely be going back to Jessica and the SkinSprit crew in the near future!</review></record></dataset><record>

Shami is the best! I took my son for a deep clean facial to help with his acne. Shami made him feel comfortable and took really good care of his skin. She gave some helpful advice on what preventative care my son could do to control his acne.</review>

I have been going to SkinSpirit for over a decade and have always been a very satisfied customer.  Lynn is especially AWESOME and has both an artistic eye and technical understanding of facial structure. I see her most often for dermal filler and she uses it wisely, without over-doing it (I'm middle aged and want to enhance my features, not try and look like a 30 year old!)   She really listens to what I am wanting and never pressures me or oversells expensive treatments.  I am always treated with warmth and respect from everyone in the office.  I highly recommend SS and Lynn to anyone wanting high quality, professional service with heart!!< /Review>

Olivia is the best! She takes care of “all of us!” A 16 year old (son), a senior in college (daughter) and a 50 year old! (The kids and I may even get Dad to go!) Olivia has been awesome! She has tailored her care & treatment of our skin perfectly. She really has a gift and vast depth of knowledge, she is a professional! She suggests great “at home” care regimens without bombarding us with product. She has pointed us to a great Dermatologist too! Her winning personality is an added bonus. We each look forward to our visits with Olivia Peterson!</review>

I went to SkinSpirit Palo Alto on Oct 12th, 2019 for my first time visit and had their SignatureFacial treatment with Aurora at 11:30am. After my treatment, my face has been very red and feels dry and tight for ONE WEEK!!! My neck is very red and itchy!!! Since the fourth day after treatment, skin on my face started to peel!!! I'm writing to share my experience and hope it could help other first time visitors and sensitive skin people to decide whether SkinSpirit is the right place for you.

For sensitive skin people, there is the possibility that the Signature Facial is too aggressive for you. Aurora wiped my face with towels very very very hard for several times and the towel is not soft enough as well. Before my first visit, I have filled out two forms online and selected my skin types and concerns. When I met Aurora, she asked my skin type and concerns again. Aurora has no cause that she didn't get the message I'm sensitive skin.

I went to see a dermatologist on the fourth day after my treatment. After applying the ointment with prescription to restore my skin barrier, my face finally started to turn normal and red color on my skin started to disappear. The ointment is very expensive ($246) even with coverage of health insurance, although you can pay with HSA.

The staff there is friendly. When I called them and asked my treatment details, they would like to help. They asked me to send my red face photos to Aurora, but she never replied my email. She may only be interested in selling you products after treatment lol.

The gmail account is not my full name. Please don't bother me again.< /text>

Had an amazing Lymphatic Drainage Massage at SkinSpirit in Palo Alto today. I recently had smart lipo/upper arms and scar tissue under the skin has been forming the past two weeks. Feels light giant rubber bands pulling my elbows toward my shoulders. My massage felt wonderful and I have more flexibility than before. Mercedes is the lady with the magic fingers! She was gentle yet very thorough, working every area to promote breakdown of the scar tissue and elimination. This is a must after lipo and Mercedes is the lady to see!< /text>

I went to SkinSpirit about a week ago now for my first ever facial and I could not be more ecstatic with the results. Shami was so incredibly kind and explained in detail every step she took (really helpful for a newbie like me). I have been having some terrible breakouts for about 6 months now and nothing I did would clear them up which was incredibly frustrating. After one session with Shami, my skin looks incredible and I feel so confident without makeup. Not to mention, she helped me find products I absolutely adore so I can keep my skin looking great between sessions. Could not recommend this place more. It's definitely an investment but so absolutely worth it. I can't wait to go back! I've attached a before and after photo, which is a bit scary for me but these results are no joke (no makeup in either!)</Text>

My wife and I have never been predisposed to believe the hype associated with the so called ‘anti aging ‘ movement; time slows down for no one (except for brilliant marketers)!

Nor are we fans of the pharmaceutical, nutritional supplement, or cosmeceutical industries that tirelessly endeavor to propitiate and engage aging baby boomers in a baroque dance of cleansers, exfoliators, lasers, serums, and moisturizers.

However the good folks at Skin Spirit
now have science on their side and make the once impossible possible.

Sculptra not only delivers exceptional results that work synergistically with the body’s own collagen making mechanisms but delivers a result that is incremental, cumulative, and (dare I say) totally natural; never looking ‘done’, artificial or plastic.  Needless to say in capable hands like Hanna Zare’s this product delivers as intended and has made an enormous difference in restoring lost volume to the face.

Thank you for making this aging baby boomer a total believer in Sculptra and thank you for your wonderful care, followup, and attention to detail.< /text>

Always exceptional! I am so impressed with how much they care about their clients and how important safety, results and honesty are to them. Their facials are better than anything I have ever had and my wife is a big fan of Botox as well! We have never had a bad experiece and I know if we did, they would take care of us.
Great job SkinSpirit!<//review>

I have been going to Skin Spirit for a year and a half, it is very, very and I mean very good.  I stumbled in one day during a staycation and had the best experience in skin care.  I saw Laura who is excellent and learned so much about how to take care of my skin.<//text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I go to SkinSpirit every time I am traveling to the bay area from Orange County (the botox capital of California). I trust Samsara to do an amazing job every time. I have done laser, botox, and fillers. I have always been anxious to get fillers in my lips. They are really sensitive and I have a very low pain tolerance. I had virgin lips (never filled) until last week. Samsara made them look full and natural, and I barely felt a pinch! I am so happy with the results.</review>< Pics>

<review>I got very sick after having received Botox there. The nurse didn't even stay in the room for the procedure. I don't know why this happened to me but I've been left with horrible headaches anxiety brain fog and that's putting it lightly. That was seven months ago. I cannot work now or go on an airplane due to the pressure.< /review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
There are nice, fluffy and relaxing facials. Then there are medical-grade facials that really get into the skin and take care of business. This week, I was the lucky recipient of a SkinSpirit Signature Facial from Cheryl.

My time in Cheryl's treatment room was spent tucked into her warm and cozy table while she worked to revitalize my tired looking, sun damaged skin. I spent the next seventy-five minutes having my face cleansed, a full session of microdermabrasion all over my face and decollete, a warm, enzyme exfoliant and mask, a round of much needed extractions and an extensive and amazing arm and neck massage. The treatment ended with the application of finishing products, including a moisturizing sunscreen.

Cheryl certainly has the magic touch! My treatment left me in a facial-drunk daze. My skin looked radiant immediately after my service. I couldn't believe how soft my skin felt, even after two days of receiving the facial.

I've experienced plenty of soothing and relaxing facials in five-star spas performed by a variety of talented esthetician, but getting a medical-grade facial from Cheryl at SkinSpirit was "the cherry on top of a sundae" kind of a facial. These treatments are medical-grade facials specifically tailored to your skin and designed to give you results, all while being treated in a calm, soothing and serene environment. These treatments certainly take care of business on the skin, but they're also extremely relaxing during the process.</review>

Thena is AMAZING.  I have followed her like a "groupie."  Receiving facial work inherently comes with apprehension.  For me, the results are paramount; associated pain secondary.  I consider myself extremely fortunate that for well over five years, I have only had Thena perform work on my face (Botox, fillers....).  I find it incredible that in all those years, I have ALWAYS been extremely thrilled with my results. Thena is a Registered Nurse with an impressive background.  The dozens and dozens of times she has done work on me, have been performed impeccably.  Thena is an artist, and I so appreciate her understanding of what best will enhance my appearance.  She does the most beautiful lips, and does so with manageable, minimal discomfort.  An added bonus, is that she is clearly very organized, and is ready at your scheduled appointment time.  I have recommended her to many friends and family members.  They all have been equally thrilled with her incredible work.  To receive such important and personal procedures, I could only recommend Thena....with absolute confidence.   Thank you SkinSpirit for Thena!<//review>

Dove Springs it’s a great place to ride dirt bikes, quads, side-by-side, or just about anything else. There’s lots of riding and even when it’s busy it does not feel like it’s cramped. I will definitely be taking my family back here to ride and go camping for years to come.</Review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><review>I'm 55 years old and this was my first time ever going camping in the desert and I had the time of my life there. My boyfriend has come here every year since he was 10 years old with his little brothers and his mom and dad. It's such a beautiful, fantastic place that's it's become a annual trip and I'm so glad I got to experience it for the first time with Tom.
A must for families with kids who love to camp, ride dune buggy and dirt bikes. Great for all ages< /review><Rate>5<//Rate>< UserId.>

I had an old wonky sliding glass door replaced by American Vision Windows and appreciated the time they took to ensure that everything would go smoothly.
Christian and Eddie came out to do the measurements, which were done quickly and properly. Christian even helped me figure out how I could lock my old door since my lock had broken and the new door would take awhile to come in.
Once the door arrived Javier, Alan, and Justin came out and installed it efficiently, and it looks great! Javier made sure to go over everything with me about the door before they headed out. They left my home as clean as it was when they arrived.
Overall I would definitely recommend this company.</text>

<Text>We have had the pleasure of working with American Vision Windows for several years.  After we first moved into our home in 1998, we needed to replace the metal frame windows with dual pane vinyl windows.  We choose American Vision Windows as they are a local company with a long history of successful window replacement and quality customer service. Over the years, we have saved thousands of dollars on our energy bills as the windows keep the house cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  Most recently, I wanted to replace our bedroom window with a slider so that we could step out on to patio deck and enjoy the evening sunset. Some people I talked to about this project were not really in favor of the idea as the work to replace the window would be a challenge.  I knew that American Vision Windows would be up for the challenge - And Wow did they deliver!  First of all, we had a quality crew with Gabriel Estrada, Jose Serrano, and Carlos all showing up on time and ready to go on the first day.  All three worked well together as they all kept busy throughout the day.  Each one knew what they were to be doing and made the most of their time and energy.  At the end of the first day, the new slider was installed.  Day two was a half day spent on the final details, the electrical outlets, and the door trim.  I am happy to report, American Vision Windows was up to the challenge and exceed my expectations.  The new bedroom slider is beautiful and adds a new element of design and value to our home.  Thank you once again for making my dream idea a reality.  Thank you, David & Michele M.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUTxpbYMRTJG7SbYv6XmhKsk7qRGDCmw0VZNNl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>{'time': 1626390281170, 'text': 'Wow, thank you, David, for sharing your 5 star experience with us!

This is part 2, the Installation, of 5 windows on May 15, 2021 which I bought from American Vision. I discovered when researching the window purchase that the quality of the installation was of equal importance to the selection of the windows themselves. I was told at the time of purchase, by Gonzo Raymond, American Visions sales rep, that the company is staffed with highly professional and interested employees, which included a crack group of installers. The team that installed our windows, Javier (lead), Aaron and Justin R. (apprentice) were just that. They arrived at 8:30 AM, introduced themselves, toured the job site and got right to work. Furniture & flooring were covered in plastic to keep them clean and prevent damage. Each workman had a specific job; they worked both alone and as a team to move the job along at a steady pace. Several times during the 5 hours they were working, I stopped to observe what they were doing and engaged in brief conversations about the process. I was amazed at how rapidly the job progressed. I was exceedingly satisfied with the quality of their workmanship and the speed of the installation.<//text>

It has been more than five months since American Vision windows began the job at my home. I have never been through/dealt with such unresponsive, careless people. I hired AVW to complete a job, signed a contract and they have been playing with us for 4 months now and left a job undone. My kitchen windows have been covered in plastic for 3 and a half weeks now and all doors are incomplete. When you accept a job ( for whole entire house for over 15 doors) , you make a promise, you sign a contract and communicate everything that is going to be done. In this case, everything has been a complete fail and lie. All of our doors are crooked, loose and the installation is terrible. I do not recommend this company to anyone. I never leave reviews like this, and I have called AVW or 3 and half weeks to come finish their job, left voicemails for management and to be specific John and Monica. and they ignore my call. Action is needed either from AVW or me.
Terrible customer service.<//Text>

We used American Vision Windows to replace four of our windows. Two that just needed it and two others that were replaced with picture windows giving us a much better view. Don guided us well in the beginning, no hard sell, and answered all our questions.  Christian followed up with finalizing the sizes and helped us choose the opening and closing sides plus answered our follow up questions.  The actual installation was done by Roberto, Emidio M., and Miguel R.   They first covered all the floors and furniture that could be affected by any dust and cleaned up everywhere when they were done.  Roberto was very helpful at answering any questions and double checked that our wishes were being followed.  The windows are beautiful and definitely more quiet. Wonderful clean job and we are thrilled.  Great job guys.<//Text>

<text>We worked with American Vision Windows to replace all of the windows, plus sliding door on our 40 year old townhouse and are so happy with the result. From start to finish it was a good experience. Gonzo was the rep who first came to our home to discuss the windows, showed us a sample, and reviewed the pricing. Gonzo was up front about the pricing and timeline and worked to keep everything in our budget. I never felt like I was getting sold something I didn’t need or want.

On the day of installation Gabriel, Jose S., Roberto, and Omar G. arrived on time at 8 am and finished the job the same day later in the afternoon. They cleaned up everything before they left.

The quality: we’ve noticed a major improvement. With our old windows we could always here people at the community pool. Now everything is so quiet! And the new windows also do an excellent job of blocking out the heat. We can actually have our curtains open and don’t have to worry about the rooms getting too hot. We also used to have a major problem with dust getting in, but now the windows are airtight.

American Vision Windows we’re great every step of the way. I’ve already had several neighbors ask about the windows and I’ve been happy to refer them to AVW.</text>< pics>

We purchased 8 windows to be built and installed on our home. Once they were built, workers Jason, Justin and Luis M showed up first thing in the morning and ready to go to work. They were very organized and each worker had there own job to do and they split up and did it with little supervision. The whole job installing and sealing was finished in about 6 hours. They did a great job and we are very happy how our windows turned out. To American Vision Windows, you need to hire more workers like Justin, Jason and Luis M. They worked great together as a team and they really got the job done with good quality. Thanks again Justin, Luis M and Jason for a job well done<//review>

<review>Very professional and reliable company. I have used them twice and both installations have been excellent. They installed 11 windows in about 6 hours including all prep, installation and cleanup. The windows definetly reduced the heat problems, as promised in the exceptionally hot rooms. The team of professional installers, including Martin, Carlos, Omar G, Justin, Ricardo, and John were gifted in their craft, professional, experienced and very neat. They were very respectful of our house and private space. We felt very comfortable with them particularly during this period of pandemic caution. THREE thumbs up.<//review>< user_name>

They care about you and your job. They go out of their way to do the installation correctly. Whatever it takes. Rudy and Ian did a fantastic job blending in my windows and door. The clean up in and out side was very professional.< /Review>< Pics>

The best company to work with from the very beginning to the end. The real kick was the 3 installers, Ian, Josh and Robert; they worked fast, efficiently and so carefully with a wonderful sense of humor thrown in.  Thay team is a great asset to your organization!!!<//Review>

First, Don was amazingly helpful and informative. Additionally, I appreciated his honesty and candid point of view about the product I chose to buy and also about the products I did not choose to buy. Second, when Christian came to measure my windows, he was thorough and also very professional. He answered all my questions in detail, and I felt excited about getting my new windows installed. I can’t wait!! My friend’s referral of American Vision Windows has been wonderful so far!< /review>

<review>American Vision windows does great work, I have used them for multiple properties, doors, windows, sliders. I have been happy with the entire experience. Gonzo is a great salesman., today  Luis G and Franco did a great job installing some custom doors. Friendly,, efficient, and left the place cleaner then when they got here!

The whole crew I have worked with at the Simi Valley location have been wonderful. Don, Julia, Christian and--of course--Eddie.

2 teams lead by Javier and Gabriel installed a sliding door, French doors and 2 big windows on the second floor. Their teams including Jose S, Ricardo, Luis G, Franco and Aaron were professional and personable. During both installations, we had another crew of workers working on our house which they were able to negotiate and work around. Everything went smoothly and the windows and doors look great. I would highly recommend this company.  Thank you so much!</text>

My husband and I highly recommend American Vision Windows. The quality of service has been superb, from initial contact to installation. Omar B, the crew chief, and his crew- Raul, Willie, Manuel, and Alex, were on time, worked quickly and efficiently, and left their work areas spotless. Omar made sure we were satisfied with the installation and operation of each window, and that we understood proper care of the windows, before leaving for the day. Kudos also to the office staff for being very helpful and courteous whenever we have had occasion to contact them.<//review>

< Review>
Richard and his crew (Martin, Danny and Luis M.) came to install 3 sliding doors and 5 windows in my 2-story house.  Most of the installations were on my 2nd story.
At the beginning of the job, I did a walk-through with Richard, and for each window and door, he noted if any unique or special thing had to be done during the installation.  In some cases there were.  He was very knowledgeable and conscious about all the items being well sealed so not to cause any water damage on my 1st floor.
The installation all went smoothly.  Their teamwork was amazing, especially lifting all the heavy sliding to my 2nd story.
I love my new windows and sliders.  They definitely make my 30 year old house look brand new, plus the keep out the heat and minimizes the UV.< /Review>

We had a great experience a few weeks ago with American Vision Windows, Inc.!  They installed 4 windows in my kitchen in Calabasas. I was extremely impressed with their efficiency and professionalism. Led by Gabriel and Jose S, the entire team was great, including Nacho, Emanuel, Rudy and Ian!  It only took two days to install the windows and complete the outside stucco work. Besides the labor and workmanship of the crew, we are very happy so far with the windows themselves!  Would definitely use them again when we decide to redo other windows in the house!<//Text>

<Text>My windows are not installed yet but the people I have dealt with so far have  been wonderful. Don Adams was so professional and he answered all my questions. He didn’t rush me. It was a pleasure  to deal with him. Then two gentlemen,  Christian and Eddie, came to measure my windows. They took the time to answer all my questions and what I was so pleased with is that they took me to each window and made sure they had the correct information on how I wanted each window to open.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>UPDATE: was just hung up on by Teri Thompson, after she informed me that I was lied to about my windowsills needing to be removed. When I asked during the 2 measurement appointments about my sills. Don and Christian both told me my sills would be fine. Installers on day of install said that was a lie. Have been calling for 6 days, only to finally talk to Teri who "looked into it" and then called me to tell me that wasn't true. When when I responded upset and said, "so I was lied to in order to sign a contact?!" She said, no I never said you were lied to." But it can't be both ways. I will never recommend this company based on my experience.

When Julia called to schedule the appointment, she was kind and courteous. I explained that my daughter would be in virtual school during the appointment, she heard my concern and assured me that the tech would be able to work around our schooling.
When Christian arrived, he was respectful of our space, worked amazingly around my 2 kids and their desire to do show and tell with our cat. He took time to answer all of my questions. Have already recommended them to friends, based off customer service. Currently waiting for install day! :-)</text>< pics>

Brad came out and listened to our ideas and collaborated extremely well to come up with the best solutions for us.

Then Todd came out to measure and made some suggestions that we ended up using.

Both were as good as I would want the agents of a company to be.

I can see why they’re the top rated company with employees and products like these.</text>

The installation crew: Javie, Richard, Robert, Wilbur, Joshua, Ricardo, Aaron, Radley, and Francisco, showed up on time at 8:15am and completed the entire installation before 4pm. They were meticulous and a joy to work with. Our neighbor across the street asked us for your contact information, and so we happily gave it to him!

< review>
I had 52 yr old windows that had leaked rain and the wood frames were dry rot.  They were very large at the 2nd story and not easily accessible.
Gina came over to give me an estimate.  She was very knowledgeable and informative.  Her estimate was reasonable.
The install crew, Javier, Aaron, Willy, and Francisco, came at the scheduled time, on time,.. I especially appreciate they had a positive attitude while the worked.  They prepped everything for safety.
They cleaned up every thing.  The windows look GREAT.

Thank You American Vision Windows

We called them back to change out our other side of the house. This time, our installers were Omar B, Richard, Emidio and Raul. These guys were very professional. Showed up a few minutes early to talk to us and walked us through what they’re doing. I was able to express my concerns because we currently have shutters in place and I wanted to make sure there were no damages or problems with opening and closing of my shutters. They welcomed to my concerns and told us what their plans are to not disturb or damage my shutters. The installer are very friendly. They cleaned up their work areas. I am very happy and satisfied with my windows and the level of professionalism in the installation. I already recommended them to a close friend of mine. Make the call, you have everything to gain from beautiful windows and people you can trust to install your windows.</text>< Pics>

<review>American Vision Windows is my GO TO window company.  The street where I live has many cars at all hours.  The street bumps doesn't slow them down.  The speed bump doesn't slow down the drag racers, who drag in the late evening and early morning.  I KNOW I'll get a good night's sleep with my American Vision Windows.

We just had our new sliding doors installed by American Vision Windows.  I can’t recommend these guys highly enough.  Willy, Jose V., Cameron, Luis M., Leo and Francisco were quick, professional and did amazing work.  We went from sliding doors that barely opened to amazing new smooth sliding doors!  Once more about our installation experts: these guys were amazing from top to bottom.  They installed everything, bringing everything over our third floor balcony due to the size of the doors, and cleaned up everything before leaving.  The simply left us with amazing doors and a spotless room.  If you need new doors or windows, try American Vision Windows.  These guys are amazing!<//text>

We are retro fitting over 40 windows and 2 sets of French Doors in our home.  From the first visit by Gonzo for the initial estimate, to the visit by Todd who documented  the exact measurments, the entire experience has been exceptional.  Everyone, including all of the support people in the office, have been friendly, supportive, and helpful.< /text>

My wife and I had a great experience with the whole team. They came out an installed our sliding glass door.

TLDR; the whole staff was fantastic - Don, Christian, Jose V and Francisco, thank you all!

Don came out and gave us the initial estimate. He was the best kind of person to talk to; he was realistic, friendly, and seemed like he had our best interest in mind. No crazy upsells, no nonsense, just wanted to make sure we had what we needed, and with the best deal possible.

Christian came out for the final measurements and pricing; he was friendly and knowledgeable (And quick).

Lastly, Jose V and Francisco installed it all. Very friendly guys, they worked with me when my blinds were in the way of the molding, and made sure everything was clean and looking nice before they left.

Will totally use again. Thank you all!<//review>

We decided to call American Vision Windows because of their prior reviews posted from homeowners. We first met Don, who came and gave us our quote. He explained everything in detail and patiently answered our many questions. He was absolutely personable, professional, and down right down to Earth. Next came Julia who called us and set up an appointment to take measurements. A few days later, Christian arrives, all I can say is "outstanding". He went over everything in detail that we agreed to with Don and explained exactly what they would do the day of installation.
I recommend this company to anyone who is thinking to upgrade their windows/doors etc. Their personal rapport is alone worth the free quote.< /text>

My experience with American Vision windows was wonderful from the start.  The lovely lady that set up our appointment, Gonzo who was very professional and had all the information we needed to know about the quality of merchandise we would be purchasing, Christian, the young man who did the measurements and the amazing team who installed the windows.  Gabriel, Jose S., Willy, Emidio and Francisco.   The entire team showed up at their scheduled times, were very professional and wore masks the entire time they were here.  They did a beautiful job installing the windows and sliding glass doors.  They also did an amazing job cleaning up.  You would have never know they were here, except now I have beautiful new windows. 😀   Thank you American Vision windows!  Great job!</Text>

First I would like to say that I am very happy with my windows and front door.  American Vision Windows went out of their way to wait for me to set a date that I was able to do.  The men that came to do the job were very professional and explained or answered any questions I had.  Luis G, Franco, Martin, Nacho, Chops, Ricardo, Emidio were on time and very knowledgeable in what they were doing.  They were all on point finishing the job.  What I liked was that everytime they finished something they cleaned up right way.  They did it all!  I will also like to take this time to thank Amanda that came to our home to show us different kinds of choices of windows and doors.  She was very helpful and sweet and took her time explaining everything.  I will be using American Vision Windows again or recommending it to my family and friends.< /Review>

<text>This crew has been nothing but professional and personable from start to finish.  Their sales staff where knowledgeable but not pushy and presented us with all the options to chose from.  Throughout the whole process they were attentive and listened to what we wanted, not trying to upset us or pad the final price for their benefit.

The installation crew were great!  Super nice and friendly guys, took extra steps to ensure the job would finish on time and not leave our house a mess once the windows were completely installed.  Attention to detail was on point.  They walked me through all the little nuances of the windows and made sure each was installed and operated correctly before having me sign the final paperwork and leaving, with no materials left laying about.   I would 120% recommend this company to anyone looking for doors or windows.  I’ve done enough home renovations on my own to know their worth.  Professional and honest, exactly what every homeowner is looking for in a contractor.

Many thanks to the whole American Windows team!

<Text>The installation crew (Javier, Gabriel, Luis, Franco, Jose S., Aaron, Rudy & John IV) were outstanding. They arrived on time and finished installing 17 windows ahead of schedule. This project was my second with AVW in the last year and, I would not hesitate to use them again given the opportunity! I definitely recommend AVW!

From obtaining a no pressure quote to having 11 windows and a sliding glass door beautifully installed, working with American Vision Windows was a home improvement experience like no other.  The installation team of Javier, Aaron, Radley, Roberto, Omar G., and John IV showed up on time and proceeded to work diligently to remove our old louver style windows and install Anlin Del Mar series windows.  It seemed like they left our house cleaner than when they arrived; their work was that good.  Javier took the time to answer all of our questions and ensured that we were completely satisfied with the job before leaving.  All the work was done in about 7 hours; this team was quite impressive.  My entire family loves the look of these windows and we would recommend Anlin products and specifically American Vision Windows as the people to talk with regarding replacement windows.  We're so pleased with the result that we'll be reaching back out to them for our exterior door project.<//review>

The response and professionalism of American Vision Windows was incredible.  I set up an appointment to start the process and Amanda R. showed up at the exact time.  She was very helpful and the selection process went very smoothly.  Julia called me the following day and set up the measurement appointment for the very next day.  Chris W. showed up at the precise appointment time and was very knowledgeable,  helpful and courteous.  He even went the extra mile and helped to make some adjustments to my existing door to keep it functional until the new door is installed - great service!  I'm very impressed with the process so far and am confident that the remaining steps will go as planned.  I highly recommend American Vision Windows - the quality and attitude of the employees are a testament to how a great company should be run!< /text>

Alan and Christian came over to do the precision measurements for all our windows and patio doors.  They were very nice to answer our questions and provided us with recommendations.  They both gave us confidence in the products they offered to their customers.
Also, Veronica at the Showroom was very kind to show us how efficient the new windows and patio doors are compared to what we have.  She also answered all our questions and because of her, we decided to proceed with the project of replacing our windows and patio doors.< /text>

They are all very professional, friendly and so nice to work with. Thank you all again for a job well done.

On March 13th Roberto, Jeremy, James and Omar G. showed up on time and did the whole front of the house plus a sliding door in the back. I was running up and down the stairs trying to take it all in. Working in efficient teams they were clean, organized and friendly. We were amazed at the quality of the work and how much they did in one day. When the rest of our windows came in. We asked to have the same crew come back. unfortunately they were already booked and we were assured the next crew were great too. We love the way the front of our house looks and were already feeling the insulating properties too.
On April 5th another fantastic crew showed up a little early which actually got me back to work in time to see a new client!...Nacho and Emmanuel Ayala and Alex Chap got to work in the same organized fashion: Floors protected, old windows removed, no mess, cleaned up as they went. Once again a precision installation and friendly too.
We were nervous about whether we were picking the right window and grid patterns but fell in love with our new look and insulation we could feel from the first install. We would welcome back these two teams to work on our house any time.  Thank you!!<//Text>< pics>

<Review>We had our new entry door installed yesterday, wow ! it looks great !
The process of picking out the door, the detailed measuring for the opening and then the installation, everything went well !
Tim Hess was friendly and professional in the process of picking out the door. He explained the whole process start to finish. Everything went as he described. Then Todd came out to measure our entry way to ensure the door is made perfectly sized to our opening did a great job and was good to deal with.  The day of installation, Alex and Emilio arrived right on time and they were very friendly and professional. They genuinely care about your property and take measures to work clean and careful.  They protected all our furnishings that were close to the entry way. About 4 1/2 hours later they were done, cleaned up, showed us the completed installation , had us inspect it ( everything was great ) and then departed. American Vision, GREAT JOB !

<Text>I just spent two days with the installers at American Vision Windows.    In the beginning my wife and I worked with Tim Hess who showed us each window in their stock at the showroom.   All the colors and styles were chosen. They came to the house.    I say they, meaning a crew of eleven installers.   Safely they covered interior floors beds and furniture.    Plastic covered the gardens and walkways on the exterior of our house.  They meticulously removed all seventeen of the seventy  year old windows and prepped the empty window casings.   They cut the new insert type windows to size. They calked and mounted each window.    They meaning eleven men working simultaneously.    They finished off the interior as well as calking the exterior of each window.   Most of the windows were completed in the first day.    The finale was the French door that was installed to replace a window in the master bedroom. Quality control like I have never see before.    I want to thank each and every one of them.   Thank you, Wilbur, Jose V., Roberto,  Carlos, Nacho, Emmanuel, Aaron, Raul,  Joshua,  Eddie, Alex M., Gabriel and Tim Hess.< /Text>< Pictures>

Would like to thanks Todd and Eddie for a great service provided with measurements for future installation of 15 windows and a sliding door in our 3-bedroom house.  They arrived on time and were courteous and professional in so many ways during our appointment with them.  Very intelligent and well-mannered guys.  Also thanks to Armen too, who was so great in helping us to secure our window contact twelve days ago.  AVW rocks!!!  Great people - great services - great product - great company!

Sales team was very knowledgeable of the products available. Jim went the extra mile to call and make sure the installation was going well.

They were very polite, respectful, went above and beyond to protect my floors and furniture, but best of all they did a flawless job on the windows. 10/10 would recommend!< /text><GmapID>0x80e82eecc76a1a6f:0x14861a5b0346ded0< /GmapID>< userid>

Carlos and Eddie did the instal on my windows and slider and did a very clean and professional job. Both were very polite and clean inside and outside my place. Would easily recommend them to everyone I know 10/10

As far as for the product. Could not be any happier. Fantastic products and extremely clean and stylish</text>

<Review>My first experience started with Armen who is a great sales specialist. You can tell he cares about getting the right windows for you and not just making the sale. Then Julia called us to set up the measurement and was just lovely. Christian came out to do the measurement and boy am I glad they sent him. He has years of experience with the company so he was able to give that additional input that you don't see with any normal person doing your measurements. He even provided trends that other people were doing in their homes so you had an idea on what's popular now but also functional for your home! And lastly he was able to answer all of my questions regarding a previous install. This guy is so knowledgeable and nice. They already installed half of my house which look great and can't wait for the other half to come in!< /Review>< Pictures>

Excellent experience with American Vision Windows. From initial consult through professional installation (with Omar B., Omar G., Martin, Richard, Justin, Emidio, and Raul) this company exceeded expectations. I've had windows installed in other homes where the company mismeasured windows resulting in delay. In this case, American Vision measured 13 windows and two sliders perfectly so the manufactured products fit perfectly. They arrived on time and worked diligently throughout the day, taking appropriate breaks and keeping me updated on progress as I teleworked. Installation was meticulous and they both covered up all of our furniture during installation and cleaned up all debris when completed. Doubt I'll need to use them again unless we move to a new house, but would definitely recommend!<//Text>

<review>The American Vision Windows team were on time, all business, clean, and friendly while their large team replaced all 20 windows and one 6’ slider in one day.  They also removed our dated kitchen garden window while taking great care not to damage the granite while cutting away the extended piece that was in the garden window.  They had to break the outside stucco and remove garden window ledge before they could install the new window.  They patched the stucco pattern so well that  you couldn’t tell repair work had been done.  Thank you to the team: Richard, Gabriel, Alex, Nacho, Luis, Francisco, Jose S, Jose V, Ryan, Emidio, James, Jeremiah and the office staff Chris, Brad and Todd.

Purchased a total of 6 windows and 2 sliding glass doors.  Even caught a deal when I ordered which I wasn't even aware of when they came to give an estimate. Excellent customer service from the 1st call.  Due to all manufacturers being behind due to Covid, I was told that it could be 10wks or more for the windows to be made.  It took less time.  Installers showed up on time - literally!  They said between 8-9am and 2 guys were here at 8am.  That seems to never happen anymore.  15mins later, a 2nd crew showed up.  Was optimistic they would be done on time - was told they would be done by 4pm.  At 2:30pm, they let me know they were finished. Emmanuel, Ignacio, Jose G. & Martin were the best installers!  Everything was done expertly, in a timely fashion, they cleaned up EVERYTHING when they were done and showed me how the locking mechanisms worked.  And when I say they cleaned up - I mean it was clean!  I didn't have to go behind them when they left to "re-clean".  I'm very happy.  I recommend them and would use them again if I had more windows to do.</Text><gmap_id>0x80e82eecc76a1a6f:0x14861a5b0346ded0< /gmap_id><user_id>117270883210005510023<//user_id>< date>

< Review>
I’ve had a very positive experience as a customer of American Vision Windows. Everyone has been so capable, kind and caring.
I appreciated the knowledgeable, strait forward approach of sales rep and project manager, Tim. He helped me choose the perfect product for my needs.
On the day of installation, Carlos and Aaron arrived right on time. They were courteous and helpful and they did such a beautiful installation!
I am so pleased. I highly recommend American Vision Windows.
I LOVE MY NEW WINDOWS!</Review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>My wife and I decided to replace all the windows in our two storytown house, we called American Vision because several home owners in the HOA had already used their service and they came highly recommended. And let me tell you, they did not disappoint. The initial sale and demo was done by Armen who was amazing, extremely detail oriented, did not try to upsell unneeded products or service, was very informative, explained the entire process, and demonstrated the windows we would be purchasing with actual samples. Armen has had experience working with our HOA, provided the estimate and official project plans the next day so we could get the work approved immediately.

Installation was scheduled a month and a half later because we had some custom window sizes which needed to be ordered and made but the entire process was very professional, easy, so easy that I was actually surprised how smooth everything went. Any time I've ever done remodeling and construction its always been a hassle, a mess, expensive and once I was done I'd always say never again. But American Vision made replacing our windows so easy I recommend them to anyone and everyone, just do it, their windows are amazing, clean, simple, modern, functional, beautiful, make the house look new and modern, and they definitely add value to the property.

Installers came exactly on the scheduled date, exactly at the specified time, they were so professional, so fast and did such an amazing job all my neighbors were asking them for their business cards. The whole job took a few hours since we had 12 windows and 2 floors but there was no mess, everything went perfectly smooth, the windows installed fit so well. Only one window was incorrectly sized previously but the installer actually point this out (even though they did not need to and could've just installed it as is and I'd never know it was not perfect). They told me they would order a replacement because they wanted the job to be perfect...I loved that.

Honestly I couldn't be happier with my entire experience. I wanted to mention, the installers by name who were just amazing, Willy, Jose V., Francisco and Manuel.

If I had more windows to replace I would, that's how good they are and how good the final product is!</Text>< Pictures>

I couldn’t be happier with American Vision Windows. This is the second time I used them (they replaced 3 windows in my home last year) and they did another wonderful job. Leo, Nacho and Emanuel were on time, efficient and organized. They worked as quietly as possible and cleaned up after themselves when they were finished. I will be definitely be using them again to replace a sliding glass door.</review>

I had the best experience with American Vision windows. Starting with Mike Wilson on the ordering, Todd on the measuring and finishing with Gabriel and Jose team with the instillation. The instillation process preformed by Gabriel and Jose team was completely professional, timely arrival, above and beyond not just installing windows, but repairing the french door frames, stucco repair, matching paint color, and the entire clean up process. They finished before the quoted time frame, and I would highly recommend them to everyone needing new windows. They beat my first quote from another company by $15000.00 They are the best at what they do. Sincerely, Susan Smith</Review>

I had my initial appointment with Amanda, which was great! She was knowledgeable and professional. She was very responsive in the back and forth with the millions of questions I had. Then came the tech measure with Christian, which was also awesome. He was very detail oriented, he obviously knew what he was doing and made it a point to explain his process (which I appreciated). I haven’t had the windows installed yet, but so far I’m pretty impressed with the service!

UPDATE!!

I have now had my windows installed and I have to say, I’m pretty impressed! Jennifer called me weeks in advance to schedule and confirmed the day before. The installers came ON TIME! and did a great job. We were replacing 16 windows in our house and the team of installers came in and replaced all of it IN ONE DAY! They re-measured everything before starting, layed out a game plan, made a huge mess, but cleaned it all up when they left! AND THEY TOOK ALL THEIR TRASH WITH THEM! It was awesome! Thank you, Joshua, Andres, Luis, Eddie, Carlos and Alan!!<//review>

Start to finish American Vision Simi was a breeze. Out of 3 companies I got quotes from A.V. won. They provided superior customer service, product and price for your buck. A.V.'s warranties made me go for it. 5 windows and 1 sliding door @ a condo. Color and style as promised. Everyone I spoke with was helpful. Big shout out to the guys that did the install. Arrived on time, big principle for me. They made it look easy. Robert (crew Boss) fulfilled my request to finish my room first. In and out in about 8 hours. No mess and they hauled it all away.

We’ve had an outstanding experience with American Vision windows.  In particular, Don and Christian have been very helpful and friendly.  Highly recommended!

Edit for April 2021:
I wanted to add that we had American Vision come back and replace two windows with a telescoping patio door and once again we couldn't be happier.  I wanted to also call out the crew who were extremely professional and helpful, just like the first crew was:  Luis G, Franco, Javier, Aaron, Justin R, John IV, Roberto, Eddy, Leo, Raul, Gabriel, Jose S, and Ricardo were awesome.

<review>My experience with American Vision Windows was excellent. Each step of the process to replace my old single paned windows for new dual paned windows was simple and professionally done. The installation crew, Martin, Roberto, Jeremy, Ian, G. and James were considerate of my home and left it spotless. The follow up duo, Sergio and Blair, reinstalled my blinds and left me a very happy customer.

I'm very very pleased with the professional and high quality work that Gabriel and Jose C. provided when addressing the problems and issues that arose.  Very courteous, excellent craftsmanship and the cleanup left the job site spotless! The new doors look like they were originally designed for the house.  Everything blends in perfectly, especially the new stucco with the old. A super job performed by Gabriel and Jose C. and I highly recommend that you ask for them for your installation.</text><user_id>117372699922712714469</user_id><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< name>

This is a follow-up to my first review.
American Vision Windows certainly lives up to what they advertise and much more.  I have now had my windows installed (16 windows and 1 sliding glass door).  The windows are amazing.  Solid, great quality and the workmanship on the installation was outstanding.  There was a crew of 7 installing my windows and it was all done in one day.  Flawless to say the least.  Omar B, the crew chief lead the other crew chief's Willy and Martin.  They were assisted by Raul, Ricardo Dez and Leo.  The entire crew was very professional and paid attention to every detail.  The four assistants  worked tirelessly in 90 degree weather ensuring all my furniture was covered and that that there was no installation debris left on my property.  I have never witness a crew to be so professional in their work and most of all, show pride in there work.  Thank you to all who worked at my home, you are to be commended.  As for the windows, I am extremely pleased.  They fit perfectly into the openings and they are solid.  The quality is outstanding.  Most of all, the price was very reasonable.
My experience with American Vision Windows has been outstanding and I highly recommend them for any window retrofit project.
Thank you American Vision Windows and please thank your hard working crew on my behalf.  They are to be commended for their hard work and professionalism.< /review>

We received quotes from about 3 other window instal companies and American Vision turned out to be the most straightforward and honesty. Not pushy or desperate with their pitch to us.
Our project manger is great with wonderful follow up with measuring all our windows by their specialists.<//Text>

< review>
The crew (Simi Valley crew, Matin, Geremy, Allan, James) were efficient and on time as promised.  They explained how they work and made sure we were comfortable with everything. They were professional,  kept us informed throughout, letting us know when they were taking a break or stopping for lunch. When we asked about a window that looked off kilter, (they were still installing other windows) they checked it right away and found they needed to replace a little wheel. They never let us feel we were being a bother and took us through each window, how they worked and asked if we had any more questions.  We would recommend them to anyone.</review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>An Amazing company. They represent excellent customer satisfaction in every way: From offering a good quality product, skilled, knowledgeable and professional workers to a great sales staff. My windows were installed about four years ago. The sales person had re-located, took my call and made sure I was contacted to answer my questions.

The workers, Blair and Sergio were Wonderful. A Breath of Fresh Air in this challenging time of Service, in general, being difficult with the required stay at home guidelines. I am hoping that the workers can share in this review and the company is fortunate to have them represent the Best of the Best.

Thank you for being outstanding in Every way.

<review>American Vision Windows has replaced all our windows and french doors, and we couldn't be more pleased, with our windows, and with the whole process. Today Sergio E and Blair C came out for service, and they did an excellent job. Very detail-orientated  and friendly. It's rare to find a company with such great product and excellent customer service. We've recommended them to several of our friends, and they were as happy as we are with the result.<//review>< Date>

Our house was built in 1973 and had original windows, patio doors and front door. We initially met with Don A. and he was very knowledgeable about the company. He treated us with kindness and respect and we decided right away to go with American Vision Windows. The final measurements were taken by Christian and we were again put at ease with his professionalism and knowledge.
We were beyond excited about our install day! Nacho and Manuel had us inspect the doors to make sure they were correct to our specifications. They did an amazing job on our front door! Not only was the product beautiful and brightened up the inside of our house, but Nacho and Manuel were meticulous with the install and stayed until we were satisfied with everything. The windows and patio doors are beyond gorgeous! Omar B. had the rest of the crew, James, Jeremy, Eddy, Carlos and Emidio take on certain windows and patio doors and they did amazing. They were respectful of our house by putting down drop cloths and ensuring that the mess made was cleaned up. They swept and vacuumed everything up at the end. We did a final inspection with Omar B. to make sure that we knew how to use the products and we were very satisfied with the work. I highly recommend using American Vision Windows! From start to finish, it was an enjoyable process.</Text>

My first contact was with Julia, who set up appointments for Don to come and give us info on windows that were available. Julia was professional and efficient. Don knew his products and I was able to choose windows rather quickly. Christian came today to measure for the windows and gave me information on installation. He was very thorough and professional. This has been a great experience and much easier than I thought.<//Review>

Our entire process was smooth and quite painlessly d I definitely would recommend American Vision Windows, Simi Valley.

Amanda was a fantastic salesperson and even suffered through some homeowner changes until we felt like the look was right.  She even checked during the install to make sure things were progressing nicely.

Our installers, Roberto, Luis G., Andres and Luis M., were on-time, worked efficiently, were respectful with their COVID-19 protocols and finally spent a good amount of time ensuring that they cleaned up and returned my home better than it was before, with some amazing new windows and back slider.

Great experience. 😁</Text>

From start to finish the experience was excellent! The sales crew was amazing and very professional. The administration people we’re awesome. But what I found most remarkable was the actual crew of workers that came out to my home and did the installation. First of all they were right on time each day. They were very courteous and the jobsite was kept clean. Their work was impeccable. The supervisors worked with their teams hands on the entire time. I want to acknowledge the crew, Javier, Gabriel, Luis, Nacho, Ryan, Francisco, Omar G, Jose S., Ian, Rudy, Beto, Edy, and Emanuel. These men worked together in a professional manner to change the look of my house that my family will be able to enjoy for years to come. I am truly grateful to them and to American Vision Windows. I highly recommend them to anyone needing new windows in their home.<//Review>

<Review>I went to AVW’s website and submitted a request for an estimate. We set up an appointment for Tuesday, 2/9, at 1 PM. The day before my appointment- Monday - I got an email confirming my appointment - for WEDNESDAY at 10 AM. I responded saying that was not the appointment  time I had been given. She said she didn’t know what happened but asked if Wednesday would work. I said no. I emailed her on Thursday and told her that I could be available Friday or Saturday. She said she had no openings for in-person calls those days but could do a virtual appointment at 1 PM on Friday. I said that would be perfect, and asked her what I needed if anything; she told me I just needed the window measurements.
On Friday at almost 2:30 PM, I gave up and went back to work. Nobody had called, nobody had emailed.
I don’t know what is wrong with this company’s scheduling but at this point, they’ve wasted enough of my time. And that’s too bad because I have a whole house full of windows I need replacing.<//Review>< Pics>

Richard and Danny came on time and were very efficient and courteous. They were very careful during the process of removing an old sliding glass door and putting a new one in.
They were great, and even gave instructions on how to care for my new slider.
I couldn't be happier with the results.

Chose AVW to give me a quote expecting it would be the most expensive of my options. Surprised they don't hire subcontractors, unlike the home chain stores, and even beat their quote. I also went into this project expecting delays because of Covid, but once the materials came in I scheduled my install. Simple enough.
Richard, Martin, Emidio, Raul, and crew arrived at 8:30a. They explained the process, working with me so I could switch my dogs into different areas of the house, laid out the drop cloths and got to work. Everyone was respectful of my home, polite, and felt the crew enjoyed working together, which is important for a job well done. I'd definitely recommend them to anyone looking for new windows.<//review>

Javier, Aaron, Mauricio, Joshua, Martin, Cameron, Richard, Daniel L., Carlos and Eddie came in on November to install all new windows and doors. The staff was very friendly and respectful. Two of the men came back to finish the wood framing around two of the windows and they did a great job. One of the men was very creative on how he finished the woodwork and detail around the windows on the outside and we were very happy with the finished product!< /Review>

<Text>We were not familiar with American Vision Windows or with Anlin windows but decided to go with them due to all the wonderful reviews. We could not be happier that we decided to call them! Our old, drafty, single pane windows were in dire need of replacing and we decided to start with the five worst.  From start to finish everyone representing American Vision Windows has been professional, courteous, and informative as well as patient with our many questions and decisions. The installers, Roberto and Omar G.were just fantastic. They were so efficient, neat, and clean. They even took down and reinstalled the blinds at each window and made sure were were happy with everything before they left. We are thrilled with our beautiful new windows and would recommend American Vision Windows to anyone who needs to replace old windows. You will not be disappointed. We will call them again when we are ready to replace the remaining windows. Thanks to all  who helped us at American Vision Windows!</Text><Rate>5</Rate><userid>106432794419934215542<//userid>< date>

From the first contact with Brad/SalesPerson to Jennifer on scheduling to Gabriel (lead), Jose S and Leo on installation, this company lived up to the hype.  They provided options on the doors I needed to replace, explaining pros and cons.  They quoted 10-12 weeks during Covid, and they delivered to the day!  Very happy, and will use again</Review>

<Review>Very nice showroom, high quality products, with friendly and knowledgeable staff. We purchased an Anlin slider, and Richard and Danny came to our home to complete the install. They did phenomenal work! They were extremely professional, friendly, and it was fun to watch them perform their craft. They were very attention-to-detail focused and the finished product looks and feels great! We are very happy with our purchase and the awesome installation! Thank you Richard and Danny!</Review></record></dataset><record>

This company was recommended to me by my brother. I saw the excellent quality of the windows and the quick professional installation. I had the pleasure of working with Jesse, the rep, who was on time, respectful and answered all my questions adequately. Juan was out the next day to remeasure the windows and finalize the deal. He, too, was on time for the appointment and very professional. I highly recommend this company for their stellar customer service and providing an excellent product.</review>

Julia gave me a call to schedule our measurements shortly after my initial contract was sent. She made sure ours was taken care of before we were about to leave so our materials could begin their lead time. Christian showed up on time dressed professionally and treated the house like his own. Very impressed and glad to have made the call with American Vision.

Willy, Franco and Luis did a good job overall today. They replaced 10 windows and a slider in a day which allowed us to sleep soundly knowing we didn’t have another day of work. They showed up on time and were very polite and clean. A few bumps here and there was the only hiccup.< /text>

Actually, I'm at the point where I've made my Pella window choices with Gonzo at our home, then Julia scheduled Christian's arrival a few days thereafter to do the final measurements, re-confirm the characteristics of each window, discuss code, permitting and basically finalize the purchase. The 3 American Vision reps worked well as a team. Nothing rushed, and all questions fully answered. I got quotes from other sales and installation companies, and none were nearly as responsive and professional overall.<//text>

After a long research we found American Vision Windows for replacing our 13 doors and windows. called them, shortly after our call we had a meeting with Tim Hess, the project manager. He was a very nice, professional and knowledgable gentleman . Today we had Christian and Allen here at our home for the final measurement. Both these gentlemen were very courteous and helpful. Christian is very knowledgable, has clear explanation for all of our related questions and helped to make good suggestions regarding the functionality of our living room patio doors. I thank them and give them all stars. So far our experience with AVW had been really great.< /Text>

Our experience so far has been fantastic. From our initial contact with Armen, to scheduling with Julia, to precision measuring with Christian, they have all been very professional, patient with our questions, and have never pressured us to do anything other than what we prefer.

They all have a customer-first approach, and that is increasingly rare. Looking forward to the install. If the quality is anything like the service I know we’ll be thrilled.</Text>

We used AVW for installation a few years ago and they did a stellar job. We own an old home and the end result was beautiful new French doors that melded with our home seamlessly.

Great experience with them. This is the second time we work with AVW for our second home. Really friendly people, good communication, and clean installment. Javier, Ian, and Blair did a great job installing our patio doors and window. We are waiting on one more window to come in and job will be done soon! Also, almost half our neighbors have had their windows replaced by AVW. 👍🏼</Review>

<Text>Blair C. and Sergio E. were the window techs/repairmen who came out to our house to repair our kitchen window. The mechanism that allows the window to open so that you can clean it had broken. They recognized the problem immediately, took the whole window out to their repair truck to fix it. They didn't want to fix the window in our kitchen which I appreciated. After about 15 minutes, they came back into our kitchen, installed the window with new parts, and they changed the window locks. They were neat, kind, professional and extremely quick. Excellent service by Sergio E. and Blair C. A great big thank you to those two and American Vision Windows.< /Text>< gmapID>

First of all, I will say we absolutely love our new windows and sliding patio door! Our crew of Carlos, Eddie, Omar and Emidio did a fantastic job installing our new windows. They were very pleasant and professional and did a perfect job in record time, we couldn’t believe how quickly and efficiently they worked. It was a pleasure to have them complete our installation, and they cleaned up completely when finished.
We are very satisfied with American Vision Windows, their product is of excellent quality, and their employees live up to that standard, as well.<//review>

<review>We had an entire 1972 house redone with windows and a sliding door. We added inside casings throughout.  It looks and sounds wonderful. The 5 man crew headed by Carlos was fabulous. They arrived on time and cleaned up beautifully inside and outside. The only minor glitch is I wish they would have taken away our blinds. My contract says remove them but I thought it also meant remove off the property. Not a biggie. I did extensive research and their  product, price, and good reputation won my contract. Excellent job and product quality!!<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Fantastic experience! AVM installed our new windows today and Omar B, Emilio and Alan did a great job. Completed the entire house in one day and the quality looks spot on! These gentlemen even left our patio cleaner than it was when they got here. Thank you guys! Highly recommend AVM to anyone looking to replace their windows.<//review>

The installers of our doors and Anlin windows were fantastic. The crew of Mauricio, Joshua Rivera, Roberto, and James are skilled at installing windows and doors. They were professional, courteous, neat, respectful of our home, and cleaned up the entire work area when they were done.
If I were a competitor of American Vision Windows I would try very hard to hire this team away and have them work for me.

These guys are great.
Thank you,
Todd< /Text>

<Text>AVW has provided an exceptional experience so far!  Gina came to the house and provided a great presentation and worked with us on the price. Julia was great about giving me time to choose the best fit for a window company but also checking in from time to time. After the dust settled I got another call from Julia and decided to move forward.  Christian came out and educated me on their window installation process answering all my questions, even the dumb ones.  Great experience, great team...I would recommend AVW to my friends and family!<//Text>< response>

<Text>Don and Christian have been exceptional. We appreciate the time they have taken to explain everything, including the positives and negatives of different brands as well as the importance of quality and service. My wife and I have had a number of quotes. We knew we found the right company when we met with Don. Christian did the follow up measurements today. I have never been more certain about choosing a home remodel service company, and we have never given a review before the final product and service has even been completed. That’s how confident I am with this company. We anticipate and are looking forward to the completion of our windows and sliding glass doors. Thanks for coming today Christian...Awesome service and detailed work man.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1580154458692, 'text': "Hello Alex,\n\nThank you for sharing your experience with us!

I want to personally thank the wonderful team that worked on my house located in Woodland Hills, CA: Thank You Javier, Nacho,Tim, José Luis, Joshua, Terrance, Mauricio, John S., and Christian Gutierrez.
The team replaced 13 windows and 3 sliding glass door and added a big picture window on an existing small window on the side of my house. The picture window has given our entryway a whole new look. It’s our favorite window now. We are thrilled and absolutely happy with the wonderful & professional service you all provided. The new windows block out the heat and the noise. I absolutely recommend American Vision Windows!<//text>

The crew was very professional, they made sure to pick up all the trash when they were done. They also made sure we were satisfied with the install before they left. I would definitely recommend AVW to anyone else, and I did.

Richard and Aaron did a great job of installing the windows we wanted exactly the way we wanted. They left nothing to chance and really went the extra mile to make sure we were completely satisfied with everything before they even started. I would definitely recommend American Vision Widows and Richard an Aaron for quality work and a quality product.
Once the windows were installed, a separate crew came out to install custom window trim coil around all of our newly installed windows. Willy, Roberto, Joe, and Raul went to work efficiently and expertly fabricating the trim to match our other windows. They’re end product brought everything together nicely in a surprisingly short amount of time.
Thank guys!< /Text>

First, our experience with the sales manager, Don, was great. He didn't try to hard sell and was clear that he might not be the cheapest, but the quality was excellent. We did our research and had to agree. We had questions along the way an Don always got back to us and assured us (we'd had some bad experiences with contractors). The day before our install is was pouring rain so we called. He again assured us saying he would not install if it was going to cost him money in service calls.

The day came and the team showed up on time. I figured there was no way they could install everything in one day on our two-story house including two sliders, but a huge team showed up. Javier, Martin, Nacho, Willy, Omar R., Jose S., Aaron, Ryan and Kane were very respectful of me and our house. Booties and drop cloths everywhere. They worked hard and checked in with me when they had questions about a particular window. Javier even told me one of the windows had a defect, though the part was easily replaced. When we did the final walk through he pointed out the defect, which I could hardly see and might have missed in the walk through, but these guys take pride in their work. They said that they would get the part and schedule a service call within the next couple weeks.

These guys were great, Don was great. They all came through, and now we have beautiful, energy efficient, quiet window. Couldn't be happier.</Text>

Eleven  years ago, American Vision replaced all our window and sliding doors. Everything went very smoothly. Today Sergio and Blair came and replaced one screen door and rescreened screens for a couple of windows. They were very professional, polite and knew their job.

My wife and I recently had our windows replaced by American Vision Windows and from Gonzo the sales rep to the installers Aaron, Javier and Carlos they did a wonderful and terrific job. Gonzo provided great recommendation for our home and presented a terrific product. Aaron, Javier and Carlos showed up on time on a Saturday and cleanly demo our existing windows while protecting our home. They did a terrific job with the install of our new windows. The stucco guys Rudy and Joshua did a fantastic job matching the new stucco around the doors to the existing stucco on the home while keeping everything clean. This company is very professional and does an amazing job !! Can't wait for our new front doors to be installed this weekend. Thanks guys</text>

After receiving quotes from about 15 different companies, we decided to go with American Vision Windows.  Our experience with this company has been great from start to finish.  We had Tim Hess come out and give us a quote for the project.  He answered all of our questions via email, text or phone call.  He made himself very available and made sure that we felt comfortable with our decision before we signed the contract.  This was refreshing since a lot of the other companies would hound us for days asking for a deposit and wanting us to sign a contract within 24 hours of receiving the quote.  We also realized that they are very reasonably priced for the type of product we received. Other vendors were quoting us for $5,000-$6,000 more for the exact same widow.

The installation crew was just as awesome.  Willy, Omar, Emidio, and Omar R.  took the time to cover all of my things and protect my floors.  They didn't leave tools everywhere and made sure they cleaned up as they moved through the house.  Omar informed us of any minor alterations that had to be made in order to install the new windows.  We have a very old house with badly retrofitted windows, so it was essential for us to make sure these new windows were a perfect fit in order to weatherproof them correctly.  Omar would consult us before making any decision.  We had all of 11 windows replaced in about 7 hours.  We were very impressed with their efficiency and willingness of this crew to go above and beyond.<//Text>

I’ve  just had 3 windows and 1 door installed by this amazing team from American Vision Windows Simi Valley.  From the moment they arrived until the time they left,  they were very professional and friendly team.   Each room was left as they found it, clean.   I was told what was about to happen before and we did a walk through after the job was finished.   I so appreciate their high quality of work.  It is detailed oriented in which I love.  Thank you: Nacho, Roberto, Willy, Raul, Luis and Garrot.< /review>

I brought my broken sliding door handle here trying to get a replacement.  They suggested I buy a new door because the door is 35 years old. I need a handle, not a new door.  They were just not interested in helping me or using their considerable resources  to try to help me.  Telling me to go to Home Depot was not at all helpful.  Another company spent just a few minutes trying to help me and they were successful. Thats the company I will use when the time comes to buy new doors.< /text>

<Text>Several things I was impressed about this company.  We originally installed American Vision Windows 2006. They did a great job replacing all windows.  We do not have no problems at all until I broke one window recently. I called them.  Impressively they kept all records of our window replacement. They knew the exact dimension of window that I need on their finger tip. The service men , Chris and Guillermo, are very skilled professional. They are so careful for their work, a kind of perfectionist in a good sense. I wish all plumbers, electrician etc are just like them.  I can see Chris is more experienced, but the way he gives suggestions or advice to Guillermo are so nice.  He is a great teacher. The company is so lucky to have them.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

We had three replacement  windows installed today.  The team from American Vision Windows (Willy, Richard M., and Luis) arrived on time and got started immediately.  Willy explained everything they were going to do, then later when they were done, he explained how to operate the windows.  They cleaned up the entire area before they left.  We highly recommend this company and this team.  The new windows look great.</text>

My definition of great service!

Here's my definition of good service.

My 95 year old Aunt had American Vision Windows replace all of the windows in her house way back in October 2005 and she was very happy with them.  Now she's living in a Skilled Nursing Facility and she's asked me to prepare her home for sale.  The ten foot sliding glass door was somewhat difficult for me to open so I called American Vision Windows (I had her original receipt) and asked that they make a 'house call' to see if they could make the window easier to operate.  Scheduling an appointment was painless and today, Chris and Guillermo showed-up right on time.  They patiently explained to me the window was basically operating OK, but over time, regardless of how scrupulously one cleans the track him/herself, debris builds-up underneath the track.  Chris said he'd communicate with Mike, his coordinator to determine what the charge would be to partially disassemble the door, clean underneath the track, then lubricate it.  To my delight (and amazement) Mike authorized Chris and Guillermo to complete the work for no charge.  My Aunt paid $7,250 to replace every single window in her home in 2005 and it's nothing short of inspiring that American Vision Windows would 'tune-up' the sliding glass door, which now, even a 95 year old could easily operate.  Highly recommend these folks.  Good leadership, good people.< /text>

We upgraded the windows of our bedroom, and our condo association recommended American Vision Windows for the job. We are thrilled with the results. The windows are high quality, and their noise reduction qualities are as promised. Additionally the staff were professional and did an exceptional job. I want to particularly commend the work Jose did in installing the window, and the work Rudy and Joshua did in repairing the stucco. The finished product blended perfectly into the building.

I couldn't be more pleased with the results, and would unreservedly recommend American Vision for all window needs.< /text>

Had two sets of sliding doors installed I  two different rooms. Crew (Roberto, Eddy and Jose G.) From Simi Valley location  arrived on time and wasted no time getting started after a brief run through of the the installation process. Prep included covering furniture and making sure valuables were removed from work area. They even picked up dog poop from backyard area where they were going to set up. They were efficient and cleaned up work site when project was done. Vice President of Simi location, Monica Estrada, made a site visit to make sure everything went ok. Doors looked great and were a great value for such high quality Anlin doors. Top notch and responsive company from Field rep, to installers and office staff.< /Text>

<Name>David Lubnow<//Name><review>They never sent me an estimate after meeting with them in my home.
UPDATE: salesperson called me today because he saw this review. He said I gave him an incorrect email( he obviously wrote it down wrong,), said he told me things he didn't,   and then hung up on me.
It seems to me he simply wanted a quick easy sale and did not want to do the work.
Seems like a quality dude!
Bought new windows today from another local company.<//review>< rating>

They were efficient, never waisted any time and it only took them 6hrs.  We were very pleased that they took some extra time to clean up after themselves. Also that they walked room to room with us to explain how each different window worked and how to clean it.

<Text>American Vision Windows has installed windows in multiple houses for us.  Our most recent experience has once again confirmed our confidence in this company.  Each Representative in the process makes our priorities theirs.  In other words great customer service always.  Cybil and Don always listen to what I want to accomplish and my budget parameters.  They offer suggestions so I get a superior project at a reasonable price.  Today I had the pleasure of meeting measure tech Christian and he was excellent and focused on his part of the project.  He also offered suggestions when I requested.  His knowledge and commitment fit the positive format I have seen displayed on every project.  I am often asked by friends for recommendations.

I am very happy with my windows.I had an issue and true to their claim Michael the coordinator called me back and set up an appointment.As scheduled and (on time ).Robert and Blair came out  and did an excellent  job.I highly recommend A. V. for their professional ,quick and courteous service. Like some companies they could have ignored my issue  as an old job..Keep up the good service and warranty response..I will continue to recommend American Vision</review>

Guillermo G. and Chris W. were my repair team and they did an outstanding job. They called me an hour before they arrived to give me an ETA and called right when they arrived. They were very efficient, responsible, professional and very neat. They are truly an asset to your company.  Hard to find good workers and theses guys were GREAT! They even left me some touch up paint.</Review>

In the showroom and at the first home visit, Gina answered our many questions and explained all of the various options and promotions available. When Christian came out for to measure, he explained everything thoroughly and went window by window to make sure we got exactly what we wanted and understood show the installation would be done. Looking forward to the installation.<//text>< rating>

Really great job. Installers were very timely, efficient and courteous. Very thoughtful in terms of covering adjacent floors and furniture.Calls from corporate rep during the process to make certain we were happy and everything was going well. Lead installer was Carlos.

American Vision Windows installed our windows about 15 years ago.  A few days ago we had a failure in an interior trim piece (which was the first and only problem we have ever had with these windows) and called them for service.  The service scheduler was very prompt in responding and set up a service call in a very timely manner.  The service tech, Chris W., let us know on the day of service that he was running a few minutes late, which is good customer service.  Chris replaced and re-caulked the trim.  The work was done in a very professional and friendly manner and it looks perfect.  He was very meticulous in the repair as well as the cleanup. Chris took the time to make sure that there were no other service issues in any of the other windows.  We are very happy with both the outstanding service and products provided by American Vision Windows and would highly recommend the company to anyone needing their services.  Thanks!</text>

<review>I am writing about a warranty repair from American Vision Windows.  Chris Walker, the lead technician on the job, and worked on discovering and repairing a previous install of my patio slider.  His assistant, Guillermo, replaced all the sticky caulking on my windows (12) from the previous install with a much better and non-sticky caulking and assisted Mr. Walker as needed.  They were professional, friendly, on time, and worked tirelessly.  They made me feel comfortable that the repair was being done to the highest standards.  I am completely satisfied with their work and recommend American Vision Windows as a trustworthy, professional company of dedicated employees and excellent product.<//review><Date>1560451966703</Date></record>

They worked well as a team and were extremely efficient. They were respectful of our needs and left our house as it was when they arrived except for much nicer windows and doors. I am extremely satisfied with the product and the installation process.</Review>

Omar and his team of Danny, Emilio and Jose arrived at the appointed time.  They installed my garden window and replaced the sliding glass door in my dining area and a kitchen window in the most professional manner. They were quiet, quick and sooo efficient. They answered all of my questions as they went about their work. I am truly happy about my purchase and that I chose American Vision Windows. As I see it, these guys are a real asset to the company. Thanks for a job well done.</text>

I just had garden kitchen window replaced in my town house by Gabriel Estrada and Joshua Rivera. They did an outstanding job to replace the window, to do stucco and fix dry wall. I have used American Vision Windows company to replace all my windows and doors in my place before and cannot stop praising them. The quality and service is superior. I highly recommend to use this company.<//Text>

Our experience with American Vision Windows has been great so far. The whole team is very knowledgeable, professional and honest. We are in the process of changing the windows in our condo and selected American Vision for the job. Christian came to our place yesterday to take the measurements and walked us through the process.

One of our neighbors had what we thought were new windows, but it turned out that they were nearly 10 year old vinyl windows. We were so impressed with the vinyl windows and that they’d held up for 10 years that we got the name of the company that she used - American Vision Windows. We called to set up an appointment about a month later, fully expecting another bad experience.

Don came out to give us the sales pitch and take initial measurements, and it was very clear on our first meeting that Don was extremely knowledgeable about their products, the manufacturing process, and the entire installation process (which, considering he’s the VP of the company and a general contractor, he should be). He put us at ease during the visit, and while we were 100% against vinyl windows, he had us sold on the possibility.

We went the next weekend to their Simi Valley offices. Don was actually just leaving as we were arriving, and he turned around and spent the next three hours going over every question we had, and was extremely patient and walked us through the different brands they carried. He never acted like he had something else that he was planning on doing that day aside from helping us. We decided to take the plunge and ordered the windows.

Measuring day came (within four days of us purchasing), and Christian came to measure all of the windows. He was SUPER nice and really went above and beyond. We asked another million questions and he patiently answered all of them. When Christian didn’t know an answer (rarely) he would tell us he didn’t know the answer and would get in touch with somebody who did. Immediately. While we were sitting there with him. I couldn’t have been happier with the job he did.

So far, the experience has been excellent and my wife and I tend to be fairly picky about what we want and we like to be well informed about what we’re spending our money on. They’ve been fantastic on all of those counts up to this point. I honestly haven’t had a bad experience with them yet, really an A++ company!< /Text>< Time>

My wife and I are very happy with the windows we had installed by American Vision Windows. Their customer service is excellent. Mike and Erica kept us updated on our project and were always available if we had questions. Our installers, Robert and Douglas, did a beautiful job. After they completed the installation they showed us how to operate our new windows. The entire process went smoothly and we could not have asked for better results.</text>

I had American Vision Windows install a whole new set of windows on my house about three years ago. They provided higher quality windows with a great install experience. Today I had an issue with a small leak due to the heavy rains and my screen door latch broke probably due to me slamming it all the time. Mike at the office set everything up and the team (Sergio and Blair) showed up resealed the small leak and replaced the sliding latch with no fuss. Other family members have used American Vision Windows and we have all be very satisfied with the product and the service.<//Text>

INSTALLED: This is a followup to my original post. The American Vision installation team lead by Mauricio (rest of team Roberto, Raul, Joshua, Joseph, and Jeremy) arrived right on time to install ten windows and two sets of patio doors - One is 108" wide! I didn't think it was possible to install all of these in one day, but that is what they did! A beautiful job and the team left our home spotless. I cannot praise them enough - thank you.</review>

Good day, I had 14 windows installed in my home. WOW!! I have heard American Vision Windows commercials for the longest time, and thought that they couldn't be that good. Well, they came today, I could not believe how good they were. Not just good but excellent. All done in one day, they were amazing. So thank you Raul, Roberto, Yulian and Gabriel. You are welcome in our home any time. Bob and Judi<//text>

From the consult, to the sale, the scheduling and install - our experience was  a smooth and positive one. Carlos, Aaron and Joe were the installers and did a great job - they were respectful of our home, pleasant and easy to talk to and left our house looking better than they found it with great new windows. I would not hesitate to recommend AVW to friends and neighbors.< /Review>

Excellent crew from American Vision Windows installed new energy efficient windows and doors today - most were southwest facing.  The crew was completely professional.The products were beautifully installed. Just perfect. It was extremely hot and humid today, and when the job was done we were amazed at the difference. Thank you Richard, Robert, Emilio, Ron, Logan and John S. for improving our home.< /review>

I was completely satisfied with my experience with American Vision Windows. Every aspect of the job from the initial phone call to schedule a consultation to completion was great. Tim came out to measure and quote and by the time he left it was like saying goodbye to an old friend. When Mauricio and Joshua came to actually install the windows they were so professional and acted as though they were working on their own house. The windows came out perfect. I will definitely be using them again! Thank you!<//review>

<review>Had two hard working young men Chris and Guillermo-  replace three windows this morning.  One window  caused them a problem, but they worked on it until it fit and the locks would work.  Nice to have these darker tinted window in place.

7 October 19  Second review.  Today Chris and Blair were her to fix the one window that was difficult to close and lock.  It took some time, but they finished the work and it so much easier to close and lock that window.  They work under Micheal.  It was good to have Chris return and work on this window.  I give them a high rating for work and friendliness.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1567621304536, 'text': "Hello Brad,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave us this review!

<Text>American Vision Windows replaced a sliding glass door in our bedroom and did a fantastic job. Tim, the rep who came out to give us an estimate was knowledgeable, friendly and quick with great info about the door we would be getting.  He said it would be a great door and it is. The quality of the door is fantastic (we LOVE it!).  Another man came out to measure (Josh? I can’t remember his name) and he was great with telling us what they would do to get the old door out and the new one in. We liked how he described everything and it sounded like they would make the door beautiful with new molding and trim. The finished product was exactly like this man said. The two men who installed it (Richard and Aaron) were professional, friendly, and nice to have working at the house. They worked quickly with expert skill and didn’t mind my 3 yr old grandson watching them work from a safe distance before naptime. Richard and Aaron made the door look as beautiful as “Josh” said it would be. I can’t say enough positive about this experience and we are thrilled with the quality of the sliding door and all the workmanship in installing it. Thanks, AVW and we will definitely be calling you with all future window needs.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1578956025594, 'text': "Rhonda, we're happy to hear your experience with American Vision Windows went well.

<text>From start to finish, I felt like American Vision Windows were professional and reasonably priced. From Don the salesman to the measurers to any contact with the company I received via phone or email, the employees were efficient, great people. The installation went well, despite the very high temperatures and winds that day. I would like to thank all the installers - Javier, Nacho, Richard C, Luis, Eddie, and Omar Rodriguez - who worked very hard, did a tremendous job and were cheerful and polite throughout. What a team! I’m happy with the quality of the workmanship of the windows, and already feel the benefit of noise reduction and the UV tinting that keeps the house much cooler.<//text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
American Vision Windows installed all new windows in my mom’s condo today.  The 34-year-old original windows just were not cutting it for noise reduction and energy efficiency.  Jose V., Mauricio, Danny L., and Luis, our installers, did an excellent job and completed the work in one day.  They were friendly, professional, efficient and worked well as a team.

They even had time to service one of my sliding glass doors today as well.  I live in the same condo complex and had all my replacement windows installed by American Vision Windows in 2009.  The caulking around the door trim had started to crack so all four guys came by and fixed it right up for me.  Thank you Jose, Mauricio, Danny and Luis!

I worked with Gonzo, our Project Manager, in 2009 for my installation and again now for my mom’s project.  He’s such a pleasure to work with and even stopped by today as the crew was leaving just to be sure we were happy with our windows.  Thank you Gonzo!

I cannot recommend them strongly enough.< /Review>

< Review>
American Vision Windows sold us these amazing windows at a very good price and we couldn't be more happy.  We didn't know how bad our old windows were until we got these beautiful Windsor windows that look amazing inside and outside and keep us protected from the wind and cold/heat so incredibly.  It took time to get them but once done, we could not have asked for a better product.  The color that Brad suggested to match our home is also perfect.  We had some issues with our stairs getting scratched up a bit during installation due to the traffic up and down and they are wood but the crew came in at their expense and polished them up nicely for us and they look amazing once again.  We are using American Vision Windows on another property due to the positive experience we had with Brad, Monica and the crew.  Thanks so much.< /Review>

We had a wonderful experience with American Vision Windows and the installation crew from Simi Valley of Roberto, Willy, Jonathan and Omar R. They were on time, professional, and respectful of safety considerations in light of Covid-19.  I would highly recommend them.</Review>

They were more than happy to come out and replace all of my windows and did a decent job, although I did have to stop payment with my credit card company to get them to come out and replace some trim that was done wrong (they wouldn't return my phone calls until I did that). HOWEVER, 10 years later when I window need replaced they did nothing but make up excuses why they couldn't do it (job too small) and when I pressed said that they could do it but would have to charge $1700.00 since they have to send a whole crew out. That IS NOT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY CONSTANTLY ADVERTISE. You have been warned......<//Review>

We are so incredibly happy with our experience with American Vision Windows from start to finish. We purchased the Anlin, Del Mar Nail-In Windows in Tan.  First, Armen came and gave us a very professional, reassuring presentation and a no pressure, competitive quote. Tim came and measured twice(since we couldn't make up our mind on what we wanted to do). He was very patient, kind, and had a great attitude. Aaron and Willy came on installation day and did a wonderful job. They were very professional and went above and beyond. They addressed our concerns and made sure we were satisfied with everything before they left. They even gave us a walk through and taught us how to use the windows and doors. Each of the employees listed above were all very positive about working for AVW and about their work environment. To me that says a lot about the company. Finally, I have to say I love the windows.  They are beautiful, solid and feel so smooth when we slide them open and closed. We're really happy we went with the Tan color too. It is so classy. And visually gentle on the eye.  We love the warranty and peace of mind that comes with this company. I totally recommend choosing them for your home. Thank you American Vision Windows!

This was an absolutely wonderful experience from beginning to end. From sales with Armen who was knowledgeable and extremely patient to the expert installation with Sergio, Ryan, and Jose. They were clean, respectful and extremely efficient. The manufacturer sent the wrong hinge for one of my windows and Michal Ramirez in customer service was wonderful in getting me the replacement in a timely manner. Also, I had thought there were scratches on the a door handle and a pane of glass which I could not remove. They were in the process of being ordered but but Chris and Blair who came her to do touch ups and replace the hinge discovered the the scratches were actually silicone and had the magic solution that removed it immediately. They were both amazing and went above and beyond all expectations. They were kind enough to leave me me the silicone cleaner and a can of the industrial, ammonia free glass cleaner. If you are buying windows, make sure you visit the showroom in Simi Valley. It was well worth the trip from West Hollywood.<//Text><time>1572379349231</time>< Pictures>

American Vision Windows did an amazing Job! Willy and Ron were the installers who were sent out to install the windows. Before they did the work they did a walk through of the home explaining the process and confirming how we wanted the windows installed. They also prepped the entire house where the work was to be done. Before they started the install they laid down tarp to protect the flooring in our home and covered all exposed furniture. Once the install was complete they did another walk through and went over the functionality of each window to insure everything was done and working properly. Thank you so much for your professional Services. I would highly recommend this company!< /Review>

We had 8 windows and one door replaced by American Vision Windows yesterday. From the initial meeting to the final installation, everything was handled professionally and with great care for accuracy and excellent communications. When they said they would do it, they did it. The entire process makes what happens in most of the construction industry pale by comparison. At the time of our initial meeting, we signed the purchase papers - the experience was just so much more professional than with the other companies who bid on our project. We had carefully explained to us exactly what windows were being bid and why, the proposal was completed in the first visit, and we signed. Two days later the person who does final measurements came at the appointed time to make sure everything measured out precisely. He also made a couple of suggestions to change the way our door was handed, that we really liked and agreed to. In between the time we placed our order and when the installation happened, we received videos from the company explaining the process steps and progress of our order. When the installation was scheduled, the crews showed u[p on time; they put down drop clothes and put up plastic sheeting where necessary, and completed the job with excellence. They explained everything about the windows and door and demonstrated how they work. We are very pleased with the company and with the Anlin windows and door we purchased. I can already tell that the solar heat gain inside our home is negligible, even after one day. Highly recommended!</text>

<text>Initial visit with Tim was great.  He was very informative and honest about the windows, quality, fit, and price points.    The second visit after committing was from the measuring team, also honest and informative on how the retro fit windows would fit.  They actually turned out looking better than I thought they would.  The install team was very punctual and did the install in 5 hours for the entire house.  They were very careful to cover everything in the rooms and cleaned up afterward.  A big thanks to the entire team Jose, Emilio, Douglas, Roberto, and Tim!  Would definately recommend!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

< Review>
We recently remodeled our kitchen and we had a small issue with the large window over our sink.  I called the Simi Valley office and explained what was going on.  The entire experience was amazing.  I spoke with Michael last week.  He gave me a day that worked for both of us.  The office called the night before and confirmed a 1-hour window.  Yes, 1-hour window!  I wasn't sitting here half a day waiting.  Thank you for that.

John sent Michael and Logan.  They were on time.  They assessed the issue and took care of it.  They noticed a couple minor issues and took care of them.

All and all a wonderful experience!

Thank you!</Review>

We're very pleased with the installation of our new sliding glass doors.  The members of the installation crew (Martin, Mauricio, Omar and Daniel) were professional and pleasant to work with.  Rudy did an excellent stucco job on the exterior.  Because of this good experience we are planning on having more window replacements done by this company in the future.</Review>

I had a new bay window installed and also had caulking on old windows replaced. The bay window installed by Nacho, with Eddie as his assistant, was done expertly and the stucco repair by Rudy was perfect.  The caulking work by Chris and Guillermo, coordinated by Mike, was overly excellent.  They took care of absolutely everything, working in such a professional and friendly manner.  Chris also assisted Nacho with the install, going back and forth between helping Nacho and completing his caulking.< /text>

<text>The best choice we could have made for replacement windows was going with American Vision Windows. Thank you Mike Ramirez, service coordinator in the Simi Valley location.  You have a great team working for you. I had my windows replaced about 2 years ago and noticed the caulking was yellowing. I called and spoke with Mike. He scheduled his team to come out and replace the caulking right away. Chris W. And Guillermo G. we’re  punctual, polite and meticulous about their work. They even added additional foam insulation to what was already there. Chris pointed out to me some buckling in the baseboard under one window. He suggested that the sprinklers could be causing some water damage to my wall and I should have it evaluated. He was right. There was mold inside the wall. Thank you Chris for going above and beyond your responsibility in representing your company and caring about your customers. The mold is being remediated now thanks to you. Awesome job guys!</text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1565045445529, 'text': "Wow, Judy!\n\nThank you so much for leaving us this glowing review!

If you're looking for new windows for your house this is the place! I can't recommend American Vision Windows enough. From the very beginning with my consultation with Armen, they exceeded my expectations in every way. The teams that showed up to do the install were professional, clean and efficient. It took two days because I had windows and sliders in my mid century home. The team, Martin, Omar, Yulian, Ryan, Rudy and Gabriel were helpful and knowledgeable. My Glassell Park house was built in 1961 and now, thanks to them, it feels like a BRAND NEW HOME! Thanks American Vision Windows! As a bonus, my energy bills have dramatically improved as well!<//text>

We had a great experience with American Vision.  They were the third company I contacted, and we ultimately went with AVW for price, quality and a level trust.   Our salesman Armen worked with us on the budget and, in the end, I was pleasantly surprised by the total cost of the project.  Today was install day  and Carlos, Jose, Richard, Eddie, Cameron and Aaron were prompt, polite, efficient and clean.   House looks great.   Love my new windows!    Thanks!<//review>

Our experience with AVW of Simi Valley surpassed our expectations, and we can unreservedly recommend the company and crew for their commitment to excellence and pride in their work.  Our experience at their beautiful showroom was made pleasant by our salesman Gonzo, and his experience and sense of humor made our decision both fun and well informed.  His follow up on the night after the job's completion was a reflection of the total experience from preliminary shopping to completion.

Although we had been forewarned that the job would likely progress to a third day to complete the stucco work on the doors, the entire project was completed in two days from start to finish including a walk through and clean ups after both days' work. Javier was the crew leader, but we  found that Nacho, Mauricio and Rudy were also head men of their own teams whom AVL had assembled to speed up the job.  The work was started on time and completed early both days.  The unified, friendly approach of other workers like Omar, Richard, Daniel, Jonathan and Kane, as well as a few more we never met, showed excellent planning and experience.  The first day's problem of some windows not arriving as per plan was quickly remedied by Javier via a special delivery that morning from Simi, and their installation was completed with no further complication.  Our reservations about the safety during this pandemic were quickly allayed when we saw the entire team in masks which they wore constantly despite the two days' record heat. Fans were also run at the end of both days to ensure our welfare. Three trucks the first day and then five the second with a bigger force was well thought out, and over twenty windows, three French doors and  a big slider went in smoothly and to our satisfaction.  AVW Simi is the best!</review>

Excellent windows (soooooo much better than the ones we replaced). And the best customer service I have probably ever experienced from ANY home improvement company of any kind. They checked in with us all through the process to keep us informed. The installers, Aaron and Carlos, were super friendly, knowledgeable and did a fantastic job. We couldn’t be happier.

Not only are the windows beautiful and wonderfully sound blocking, the installation went very smoothly.  The crew worked together so well.  They were cheerful and efficient.  Clearly they have been together for a long time and enjoy working together.  We had 26 windows, so they sent a large crew and got it done in a day and a half.

American Vision windows is a great company!  They go out of their way to do it right the first time, and if in the off chance it isn't quite right, they'll make it right.  Steve in sales is amazing, Gabriel and Joshua the installers are geniuses, and the service guys Chris and Logan and Michael the service service coordinator are top notch!  They took care of some additional work that needed to be done, and spent an entire day replacing some discolored caulk.  These guys are the best of the best!</review>

Great experience with this company. Friendly estimate from Don, who worked with me, giving several options and scenarios for installs. We opted to have two patio sliders installed. We were scheduled shortly after doors were made. Martin and Eddie completed the job in half a day. The doors are smooth and quiet. The screens, weightless. Great install and experience all around. Looking forward to having them do our windows too!< /text>

<review>Yesterday American Vision windows replaced sixteen windows and a sliding glass door in my home. I don't think I'll be able to fully convey how good of a job the group of professionals we had install our new windows, but I'll try. We had a huge team, consisting of: Jose V., Robert, Richard, Omar R., Cameron, and Jose P.

My wife and I were amazed at the skill, professionalism, and rate of production. The team was very respectful to our home and our family. At one point one of the supervisors pointed out damage to our home; luckily I was right there to assure him I had actually caused the damage. This I believe is the sign of a truly honest and respectful team.

The final product is truly awesome! A large part of that comes down to the true craftsmanship of the the aforementioned team. The team truly went above and beyond with our install, which, I'm sure will hold up to the test of time.

I also can't say enough about the windows we chose. Anlin windows are truly in a class by their own. I am stunned how good and beautiful the windows and doors are. I also love that the windows and doors are truly double lifetime warranties. Believe me while I was soliciting quotes I ran across A LOT of gimics other brands use. Anlin's warranties are better than any other company, in their price point.

Thanks again to the whole team that worked hard to put my project together. Monica from the front office worked exceptionally hard to ensure everything went smoothly, and I thank her for that. Thanks again American Vision Windows!</review>< Date>

I just had all new windows put into my home.  What a well oiled machine!  the window installers showed up on time, were polite and professional!  9 men arrived and the window installation began at 9am and was completed by 1:30pm the same day.  Gabriel, Joshua, Martin, Luis, Terrence, Mauricio, Omar R, Emilio, Nacho an Eduardo,  Kudos to you all!  You were all a pleasure to have in my home.  Everyone seemed so happy, singing and laughing with each other.  My home was left spotless and my new windows are beautiful.  I would highly recommend American Visions to anyone!  Excellent Job!

Now, nine years later, I still contact them on occasion for parts. The first time around the guy just dropped by and handed me the parts, free of charge (they were user-replaceable parts, so I was happy to have them). This last time I figured I'd save the guy a trip and stop by the showroom to see if they were on hand. Sure enough! I had my parts in hand and was out the door less than five minutes later, also free of charge.

I admit with some shame that I didn't shop around to find the best installer initially. Fortunately, I picked American Vision Windows and ended up with zero regrets just the same.< /text><pics>None<//pics><UserId.>109744594921790820531</UserId.><Name>Brian Rickard< /Name></record>

Wilbur and Luis M did a stellar job installing our Anlin vinyl retrofit windows yesterday and they held up great with last night's rain - no leaks! (which was a problem with our prior windows). Very professional and satisfied with the work and pricing.

4/30 update: Chris and Logan just finished up installing the flat trim on my window and re-chalked another one. Super great service and incredibly friendly!

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>American Vision Windows just installed my new Anlin, Delmar Luxury Vinyl Windows three days ago.
Raul, Aaron, and Martin were very professional and precise in their work.  At the same time, they were friendly and approachable.  They explained the installation process to me in detail, and answered all of my questions.  They also showed me how to use all the different features of my windows.
The windows are not only beautiful, but they also help to buffer the outside noise, and control the inside temperature.
I am very satisfied with the results, and would highly recommend American Vision Windows to anyone.

Got our windows installed today! So happy with the Anlin Mar Vista windows and with AV Windows for installing them! The salesman Gonzo helped us decide on a much better choice for our windows than we were planning, and was very professional and helpful, even when we changed our minds about a few things. :D Gabriel & Joshua did a great job installing them today! Very friendly and conscientious about their work and leaving the areas clean. The windows have taken off at least 10 years from our home, and we are looking forward to the energy savings going into the summer, not to mention no more leaks! Thanks again to Gonzo, Gabby, Jack, Gabriel, and Joshua!!<//review>

I bought my house over 8 years ago, our windows were installed by the previous owner who included the original contract for American Vision in a big pile of paperwork. Two years ago some of the molding came off the a couple of the windows, I called and was put in touch with Michael, who was very helpful. He asked me to send him photos, after which I promptly lost all the paperwork!

Two years later I found the paperwork again, called them back, and Michael remembered speaking to me and sent a crew out within a couple days. Blair and Sergio arrived on time, and did exceptional work. They did all the requested work, and a bunch of other stuff too - cleaning the windows, adding clips to the screens where they were broken, adding in new caulking/sealant in several areas, and lots of other stuff. All this, without raising the price over what I was quoted. It seems fewer and fewer companies underpromise/overdeliver these days, and I'm happy to say American Vision did exactly that. I'm especially impressed because they did all this knowing I was not the original purchaser/contract holder. I'll use them in the future, and recommend them if you're in the market.< /text>

American Vision Windows did a great job installing our front and back doors. Very friendly, professional, did the work and cleaned up everything when the job was done. We had a issue with our lock and Guillermo and Chris came out to fix it. They arrived promptly, were processional and fixed the problem. Great job overall! Would absolutely recommend.< /review>

I waited patiently for today, my new windows were being installed. Not knowing what to expect about this installation project had me a little nervous.  The first crew showed up with 2 guys, I was informed that 2 more crews were right behind. At this point I definitely was not sure what to expect.
Before you know it all 7 crew members where now at my door ready to get started. There was Javier, Sergio, Roberto, Daniel, Richard, Douglas and Ronald. Each and every one of them were very respectful and very professional. They were very meticulous in making sure that all furniture and floors were completely covered. It was like having a bunch of worker bees in my home.
I was very delighted that by the time the job was complete the only evidence that this crew of 7 was in my house was beautiful transformation to the look of my house. From the condition of the inside of my house the clean up was incredible, they left nothing behind. You would have never known the amount of work that went on.
I would definitely 100% recommend American Vision Windows to anyone looking to replaces windows, they are the only way to go.
I want to personally thank Javier for taking the time to go into each and every room with me checking the finished job. Also explaining all the little details on my new windows.
To Javier, Sergio, Roberto, Daniel, Richard, Douglas and Ronald thank you for a job well done. I will be talking about my new windows for a long to time. This was the best decision I made going with American Vision Windows, Simi Valley.
Once again thank you American Vision Windows for this wonderful product and beautifully made windows. Anyone thinking about windows and you do go with AVW please ask for this crew, Javier, Sergio, Roberto, Daniel, Richard, Douglas and Ronald, there is none better, Thanks Guys. It was the best customer service experience ever. Keep up the great work.

One exceptionally satisfied customer

Theresa

Just a quick update.....not only was the install crew wonderful today August 29, 2019 the service crew was to my house. A few minor tweaks.  Christ and Guillermo took care of the 2 little tweaks and then went on to inspect all of the windows inside and out just in case there was something I might gave miss during  my inspection. They were both very professional and very personable.
I must say, American Vision Windows has a good staff of people working for them.  Keep up the good work.

Jose V. and Terrence arrived a little after 8 am and got right to work. They were courteous, friendly and professional throughout the installation and kept me informed. I had been prepared for the possibility of a slight extra charge to replace 2 sills, but it turned out they were usable after all and they saved me a few dollars in the process. They even helped me remove a window air conditioner that I was having a hard time with. It's really not their job to do this extra work, so I was grateful that they offered - another sign that I had hired the right company. Obviously I can't yet review the performance of the windows since they're brand new, but they look great and I'm happy with the quality of the product and the service provided by the company throughout the process. Well done!</Text>

< Review>
I had a security issue with a sliding door that was difficult to open and close and lock. The service job was scheduled for Memorial Day.  My wife and I thought that was probably a mistake. Unless you were work for a store front business, most businesses are closed. Surprisingly enough two service men showed up and at the scheduled time. I want to give a huge shout out to team leader Chris Walker and Guillermo G. These guys were everything that an employer would want it representing their business. They knew exactly what to do, had the materials with them and was very clean in doing the job. Without a doubt, they were very customer and job focused. Since day one, approximately 15 years ago when we had every window, approximately 20 plus this slider, installed, I have been very happy with American Vision Windows. Thank you AMV and Chris and Guillermo for the great service. You're the best!</Review>

It's exactly a week ago we had our windows installed .... amid the apprehensions of Covid-19 pandemic! But the installation crew of the Omar B (with Omar R, Mauricio, Rich, Danny Emidio and Martin) came prepared with all safety precautions (with masks, gloves), worked hard &  fast, were courteous and careful. Did an excellent job, indeed!
However, our most pleasant experience was with pre-installation measurement tech Todd Somdell, We are very thankful to Todd as he is the one who assured us and also saved us from losing the contract. He was very professional, courteous, and pleasure to deal with.The demo and product selection by salesman Gonzo was persuasive too.

We also appreciate the follow up call from Jim on the day of installation. Overall a great TEAMWORK! We are very satisfied. Thanks< /Review>

The windows and sliders are great—not only do they keep out the elements, but they greatly cut down on nuisance neighborhood noise.  We only put the best in our house, and American Vision Windows are probably the best “addition” we’ve made.  And the installation teams were also terrific.  Today’s team was Jose and Emidio. They were excellent—friendly, fast, and efficient.  Love the windows.</review>< time>

Several neighbors have already commented on the obvious attention to detail by the workers who installed my windows and want the company information.  I will always recommend they request (as part of their contract) that Martin and Danny will be part of the installation crew.</Review>< pics>

Chris and Blair came today to service my sliding glass door and add a deadbolt to another slider. I really felt that they went above and beyond with my service today. They were polite, nice, and a pleasure to work with (as were the original installers and my salesman, Mike). I highly recommend American Vision.<//review>

AVW installed 7 windows and 2 sliders yesterday at my rental property.  Big shout out to Roberto, Raul and Joe for a perfect install, and also to Christian who noticed the grid spacing as done by the computer would not look right.  He corrected it before the order got to the factory.< /review>

I recently moved into a townhome that was all single pane windows and near a busy street. Reducing the outside noise was my primary motivation for wanting to get new windows and energy efficiency was also important.

Everyone that was involved in the window install was very friendly and professional. Don, the salesman, explained the process and cost accurately and knew what was needed to get the HOA to approve the new windows. Christian, measured the windows in no time and was very friendly. A few weeks later the installation took place. The crew that installed the windows, Jose, Danny, and Cameron, showed up on time and were extremely courteous the whole time they were working. They gave a rough estimate of how long it would take to complete the install and they did it well within the estimate. I was surprised how fast they did the work.

I’ve had the windows for a couple of weeks and they look great and cut down the outside noise considerably. I’m looking forward to saving on my energy bill. I have been working from home and the outside noise is not as noticable, unless a leaf blower is being used right next to my house. Even then, the leaf blower noise is not nearly as annoying.

There is one thing about the windows I was not expecting. The light transmission is less than the prior single pane windows. The good thing about that is the glare from bright daylight is less intense. The downside is there is a little less natural light in the living room and so the inside does not look as bright. Overall, I’m very happy with my purchase from American Vision.<//Review>

The BEST home improvement company we've ever used!  By far!!

The sales rep, Gonzo, was so helpful, punctual, knowledgeable - very personable and funny!  Todd came to the house after Gozno and did the final measuring and ordering (AVW obviously prescribes to the old adage "measure twice, cut once").  He made sure we knew what we were paying for and that we were satisfied with the final order.  Monica D. in the office made sure we were kept up to date and informed (via emails, calls and texts) and was always reachable - so important when you're spending thousands on your home.  Would like to meet her someday. ;) (Inside joke.)

THE DAY our windows were installed was unbelievable - the crew OF EIGHT guys showed up just after 8am and were done with our entire house (17 windows, including 2 sliders and a brand new front door - YES, they do doors too!) before 3pm.  The crew introduced themselves when we crossed paths, they did a clean and precise job of installing each window/door.  They seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs and working with each other (lots of laughing) - for a homeowner that translated into their best work.  AVW installed when they said they would and it took just one day just like they promised.

Javier led the huge crew and walked/talked us through the process.  The rest of the guys; Omar M., Martine, Aaron, Jose S., Raul, Joey and Beto got right to work.  Within the first hour they had all the old windows removed!  Before 3pm our house was transformed!   We didn't put up our curtains for a few days because we enjoyed looking through our new windows too much.  ;)

We selected American Vision Windows because of their reputation and we like to support local businesses. Check out their website and watch the video from the owners - they share why they built their business.  It's a compelling message when you need/want to improve your home and you know it's going to be a large expense - you understand the owners relate to all the concerns a homeowner has when making a choice in contractors.

The only downside to AVW is that we can't hire them to do everything else we want to do around our house!  Haha!

I would recommend them to anyone, any time.  They will take care of you and take great care of your home.</Text>

We had our new windows installed today, the crew Carlos, Aaron and Terrence were fantastic. I also received a call from Jim Solo to see if I had any concerns or questions. Jim also texted me with his number so I could contact him if I had questions while the guys  were installing. They covered the furniture  near the windows and put tarps down on my floors in the entry way and under each window to protect my floors. I highly recommend AVW they are very professional and the windows are beautiful.</text>

<review>The American Vision installation crew did a great job of replacing all the windows in our 5 bedroom home. The six man crew was professional and worked well together with great comradery. Before starting, they protected the entire interior with tarps and plastic. Demolition, preparation, installation, finishing, and cleanup went smoothly. My thanks to Richard, Eddie, Jose, Emidio, Wilbur and Ron. We are enjoying the new found quiet from outside noise and an air conditioning system that is working less often.< /review><rate>5</rate><time>1567725676083< /time></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I have been using this stellar company for over 9 years now, as have my neighbors!!

They have replaced termite damaged windows and doors,  weather related damage to windows with such expertise and a caring attitude!!!

From the first phone call, through the measurements and finally the installation with Wilbur, Jose, Nacho, Eddie, Emilo, Ronald, Aaron and Luis, each step was beautifully organized and executed!!

You will be taken care of with kid gloves and your new windows and doors will bring the outside into your home with such clarity, I promise!!!< /Review>< Pics>

Blair and Chris (and Michael in the office) diagnosed my window issue and offered to return to fix the problem (and help with another caused by earlier work on the outside).  Recommend highly.

Update: Michael scheduled me very quickly and Chris and Blair came out today (10/21/19) to rehabilitate my windows.  Their work was fast and professional and included new wheels.  They also recaulked the seal around the window that was giving me trouble with rainwater leakage. And they plugged several holes in the stucco where an awning used to be that might have been contributing to the problem.  Very impressed with the guys and their efficient helpfulness.  Again, recommend highly.</Text>

<Review>We had 22 windows and a kitchen garden window installed yesterday by American Vision; they actually brought out 4 three-man crews to get the job done in one day.  They were extremely professional, courteous, and the quality of their work was impeccable.  Everything was covered; floors, TV's, furniture.  They took great pains to clean everything they came in contact, with Aaron going as far as to borrow a grass rake to pick up small pieces of plastic shavings from the window trimming done on the front lawn.  They actually finished the window installation in about 5 hours. Today, their stucco man came to finish the interior of the garden window and repair the exterior stucco.  Again, excellent from start to finish.  I highly recommend these people; they did exactly what they promised at every phase of our project.  I will be using them again soon for a front door ensemble.  Thanks, AVW!

It is an honor to rate American vision windows 5+ stars as they are exceptional in what they do, not only in quality but in service. Don Adams, our sales engineer, has been faithful supporter advocate and guidance counselor over many many projects for our family. Bill and Kathleen should be very very proud and honored at the work the exceptional work that is done by their staff Both administratively and in labor. The Amlin Delmar collection windows are top-of-the-line we had 25 of them installed in our home mini years back in the home with friends family and most recently my father-in-law who just moved closer to us and had old outdated 40-year-old single pane aluminum frame horrible windows.  The installation teams are kind courteous clean respectful on time and thorough leave no stone unturned and install per exact specifications of sales engineer Don Adams. It is without reservation that I highly recommend American Vision windows to anyone in the United States it’s looking for the finest quality of windows installation services and exceptional teams for this purpose. God bless Bill and Kathleen and the teams at American Vision windows may God richly bless the company now  and far beyond in the future thank you thank you thank you !!!!!!!!!!!!

<rating>5</rating><review>I am giving a 5 star review for Chris and Blair themsevles. We have never had a problem with our WINDOWS themselves and they are great but the original install job was not exactly the best.

Had my windows installed last week and I can definitively say that I'm blown away! Been in our home for 18 years and about 15 years ago we got a quote for windows that was 3 times more expensive than AVW!! We were so disappointed that we never even entertained having other quotes. So bummed we didn't get a quote from AVW 15 years ago.

The team that came out promised me that they'd be done by 5PM. At 5:03, they were finished. The crew, Willy, Jose, Richard, Omar, Gueret and Cameron were super respectful, hard-working and very nice. I ended up going with AVW after seeing the amazing job they did on my neighbor's custom windows and sliders. I finally asked my neighbor how much he paid and I actually thought that the price was just the deposit he put down. No, it was the final price!!  Seriously, you will not be sorry going with AVW - and, NO, I didn't receive any kickback for posting this. I just want to share a great experience.</Text>

<text>The service we received from American Vision Windows was top notch! From our initial visit to their Simi Valley showroom and follow up in home appointment with their rep Steve, we were very pleased with the product presentation and how the ordering and installation process would take place. We were kept in the loop every step of way as to when our widows were ordered, when they would arrive, to the final installation date.

I must make special recommendations to our install crew of Sergio, Omar, and Ryan. They arrived on time, took special care to protect our flooring and furniture, but most of all the windows and patio door were installed flawlessly! They were all extremely professional, polite, and a pleasure to have worked on our home.

We highly recommend American Vision Windows and looking forward to enjoying our new windows for many years to come!

Thank you,

There were  extra  large windows that were retrofitted into the existing metal frames. The installers worked with precision   and  were  respectful and professional .

Brad Hopper, who was out initial introduction to American Vision has been so helpful.  He gave us exactly what we wanted.  After having our windows installed we called him back for new entry door.

Christian is very thorough in his measurements and as kind as can be.  He explained everything to me in detail.

The installation team was amazing....Gabriel, Mauricio Alex, Joshua Riveria, Ryan Bunnell, Aaron Dufresne, Javier Estrada, and Rudy!  They stayed late to get our home sealed up so I we could sleep safely at night and they did a beautiful job!  We love our windows and can't wait for our new entry door!  Thank you!< /text>

We wanted to let the people know how happy we are with our experience with American Windows.  We had two windows that needed replaced.  After visiting the show room in Simi Valley and seeing all of the options with Don, we decided to replace all of our windows.

We are very happy that we made this decisionl.  American Vision made the process easy and the finished product is beautiful.

They installed in one working day and with the help of a huge crew, Richard, Wilbur, Eddie, Ron, Crarret, Logan Javier, and Raul, the job was completed by 4:30.  They rehung the draperies and left the house in clean condition considering the work they had done today.

We are very happy and couldn't recommend this company enough, 5 Stars !!!

<review>AVW is an awesome company. This is my 2nd house I have done work with them on.  The quality is outstanding and they bend over backwards to stand behind their product. They just spent several hours repairing my front door which was well out of warranty at no charge authorized by Michael Ramirez (Service Coordinator). He is such a great guy!  The techs were Chris and Logan who were both seriously artists in the way they custom built a replacement part that looked better than the original.  I cannot recommend them more highly!</review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1559064720500, 'text': 'Thank you for writing this wonderful review and for the recommendation, David!

<Review>We had our windows installed by American Vision in August.  I can tell you that the sisters, who are in their 80's really like them as they open quietly and easily and keep the noise out.  The installers were efficient and accommodating to the needs of the sisters.  We will be using American Vision again this coming year.

Let me start off by saying the product, the windows themselves, are great. This order was the second set of windows that we have purchased. The installation was generally OK. The crew did a good and timely job. They made a mistake by removing and throwing away some doggies doors that were suppose to remain. They also broke a window treatment and did a poor job sealing several large cracks in the stucco around an installed slider. I called the customer service line and immediately got a response to my complaints. Several reps came to the house and inspected the damage. The cracked stucco was fixed by the end of the week. I was told that the company would order replacement dog doors and they would be sent immediately. That was over 3  months ago. Easily 20 unanswered phone calls have been made. When I did connect, they promised me the doors would be delivered by the end of the week each time with no result. I have a promise from the customer service supervisor that he has physically touched the doors, of course they just arrived today, and they will be here in two days. We'll see. They never have acknowledged the broken window treatment. I figure I'm just going to have to eat that one. Use at your own risk. I never will again. Home Depot here I come!< /text>

Steve our sales representative walked us through the process and we love our new windows and French patio doors! The day of installation my husband and I were extremely impressed by the team of 8 men who spent about 7 hours ensuring that everything was installed at the highest level. Emedio, Gabriel, Luis, Joshua, Mauricio, Nacho, Oscar, and Ryan did an AMAZING job.  They kept our home properly covered from dust and cleaned up when the job was completed.  They were friendly, courteous, and professional while installing our beautiful windows and doors! We recommend American Vision Windows if you are looking for quality and we lOVE our home investment. We no longer can hear the kids outside on Sunday morning because our windows are great in keeping the noise out and helping to keep our home cooler!

We recently had 5 windows replaced and couldn't be happier. The staff is wonderful. Steve, the project manager, was very friendly, knowledgeable and explained all the options and brought samples of the windows in for us to choose from.  Tim, the installer, did a great job, was fast, efficient and very polite. Both were very patient and took the time to answer all the questions my 85 year old mother-in-law had (and there were a lot of them!) and we are very happy with the results, the windows look great and the price was reasonable. We'll be back for sliding glass doors soon...<//Review>

Our experience with American Vision windows was outstanding from the initial call to the completion of the job. All the individuals that we were in contact with from sales to installers were friendly and helpful in making this a pleasant experience. We installed 11 windows and at the end of the day there was nothing to clean up other than moving a few pieces of furniture back into place. They left the our home spotless! We are completely pleased with the service and the windows.< /review>

Just had 7 windows and a french door changed to a slider last week.  We went with Anlin windows and they are amazing.  Cuts down the heat by a ton even without window coverings and they're gorgeous.  Work started at 8am and they were gone by 3pm, with the worksite completely cleaned up.  Carlos, Aaron, Nacho and Luis were excellent to work with, so friendly and professional.  We could not be happier with our decision to go with AVW.</Review>

Our youth pastor Dave de Vos shared the story of Bill Herren just as my and I were trying to select someone to convert our front windows—to doors with sidelights. We were overwhelmed by the options and advice, but felt very comfortable walking in the doors of American Vision Windows Simi Valley office. Their staff made recommendations and even their son Jake Herren took the time to walk us through the process!

Cybill took our custom order and she sent out her "best" man to measure and oversee installation (I won't mention his name or everyone will be asking)! The installation crew was quite a team. The arrived on time and left the place as clean as when they arrived. We felt comfortable when city inspectors arrived that there would be no issues based on there long and strong reputation for quality.

Our new doors/windows look amazing and we are very willing to recommend American Vision Windows to anyone not sure where invest their trust.</Text>

Great experience with AVW Simi Valley from start to finish. Their crew Robert, Martin, Eddie, and Douglas had my eleven new Anlin windows installed in about five hours. They actually left the work area cleaner than when they arrived. Five stars and a hearty well done!<//Text>

<Review>19 new windows installed today. Efficient, clean and friendly crew arrived on time, were organized and demonstrated excellent teamwork.  Very impressive! A shoutout to each crew member, Martin, Segio, Josue, Terry, Douglas and Luis. Polite and friendly they made a huge undertaking appear effortless. Supervisor John stopped in to assess the progress and he too was receptive to questions and encouraged us to contact him directly with any issues. Before leaving Martin answered our questions about how to remove windows for cleaning, locking windows and Sergio reminded us of the lifetime warranty. Excellent company. We higly recommend American Vision windows.</Review>< pictures>

I had a wonderful experience with the first person, Mike Wilson, who came to my house to introduce/ sell the American Vison widows. The person who came to confirm the widows measurements also was really nice. The windows are now installed and I am very happy with them. However, I was disappointed with the workers who came and installed the 13 windows. They fabricated a story that my dog bit one of them. My dog was outside in a short leach where it couldn’t reach them. I was at home for the whole time and did not see it or were communicated by any of the workers hat it happened until the day after they installed the windows. The workers left broken pieces of glass all over the house, including two pieces on my sofa. Which cut my 8 years daughter’s hand. The workers smoked outside the house.
At the end of the installation, the head worker did the walkthrough and asked me to fill a survey about their job. I felt pressured to give them five star because he was right beside me when I was filling it out and I just wanted the installation to be over since it took about 8 hours and it was a hot day and my daughter and I had to be outside.<//Text>

<user_name>Stacy Friedman< /user_name><text>The entire Simi Valley crew was incredible!! Jose, Willey, Robert, Ron, Emidio and John. They arrived on time and introduced themselves to my husband and me. They were extremely professional and meticulous!! So much that there were areas by my windows that were dirty prior to the installation. After the the windows were installed, the area was cleaner than they had been from the beginning. All the men were very professional and very patient. I have 2 dogs and they were sensitive to their needs (my dogs rule my home). At the end of the installation they went over every window (all 23) to show us how to use them. Such patience and professionalism. Prior to choosing American Vision, i searched and interviewed other window establishments. From the get go, the sales man Craig Giras, the measurer, the administrative people at the Simi Valley store (Julie), all did everything to accommodate our needs!! And literally through out the process, Craig was checking in and available for any questions we had. We literally called him the day before the installation, on a Sunday, and he addressed all our questions. And having Willey, Jose, Robert, Emidio, Ron and John in our home all day went rather well. They made sure everything was covered and protected and treated our home like it was theirs.  My husband and i are thrilled with the windows and the professionalism from the entire organization. Thank you American Vision!!!</text>< userid>

< Review>
Today John Solórzano sent out two teams to install our windows in Camarillo.  Omar and Danny, Carlos and Erin worked in perfect sync to accomplish the task.  They were careful to pay attention to detail and the windows look amazing and work perfectly!  During one of our many conversations throughout the day, I had pointed out to Carlos how I still needed to finish the trim on the front door entryway as we had changed the wood flooring in the home and I needed to purchase a small piece to fit across the threshold.  I mentioned that I might be able to use a piece of wood that they had to remove to put in the sliders as it would match. As we did a final walk through, he took me back to the front door and to my complete surprise, he had cut and placed the finishing board for my approval.  I was pleasantly surprised and blown away that he would take it on himself to do something that nice for me.  Kudos to him!  They were all so friendly, cheerful, and easy to work with and their desire to truly make us 100% satisfied was evident from the start to the finish.  By the time they walked away we felt as though we had made new friends.  Oh, and by the way, we did not have to clean up after them at all!  There was no dust, no scraps, no anything left behind.  It was as if a fairy came through and waved her wand and we had new windows. This is the second home that we have installed American Vision Windows in and can honestly say that their customer service as well as their product is top notch!  They are worth every penny and more!  Even Gonzo, the original salesman that we met with, stopped by today to check on the project.  Thank you American Vision Windows!
Debbie and Tony Banuelos

On Dec 2nd Chris and Blair came out to check on our sliders to ensure they were sealed as we were expecting a lot of rain.  They put additional sealant around the base of the sliders and even gave us an extra tube in case we needed to use it sometime in the future.  He also explained how to apply it to make it the most effective.  They were very professional and helpful.  Thank you again, American Vision Windows.< /Review>

We needed to insulate our windows to reduce party noises from our neighbors. American Vision Windows offered a solution by installing windows that not only reduced the noise but also reduced  our air conditioning bill.  They offered a deal for installing 6 windows and a sliding window, which we could not refuse. The installation team was on time, they were very  courteous. They completed the job earlier than promised, and left the working area perfectly clean. We are very satisfied with the work.< /review>

Alex came out next  made the final measurement for installation. The price was  was definitely in my budget. Three guys came on time,clean professional, explain what they are about to do.  Roberto, Rico, Daniel.  I now have a "White vinyl slider patio door."

<text>Amazing! There were two things that had prevented me from replacing my old wooden windows -- the cost and fear of a construction nightmare. American Vision Windows solved both problems. Gonzo gave me a great quote (and I compared them to three other companies) and walked me through the HERO financing program. Then they showed up with 5 trucks and 18 guys and installed 36 windows in 7 hours!!! I went out for the day and came home to a house that was cleaner than before I left! A week later it rained and an old leak that I thought was related to my roof, didn't happen. It must have been my windows. I love these guys!!! I'm so grateful.</text><pictures>None</pictures><rating>5< /rating>< Name>

<Name>Kathleen Blackwell<//Name><rating>5< /rating><Text>American Vision is the best kept secret. Not only do they offer great products at a reasonable cost, but their installation is beyond superior.
I am a very picky customer and have had a wonderful experience in all three projects contracted with American Vision. I began with the installation of new windows in my home, followed by solar panels, and just finished with a custom double entry door installation, which by the way, knocked my socks off. Believe me, if there had been any product or workmanship issues, I would not be a repeat customer.
In my opinion, the company deserves more than the highest rating and I do pay attention to other customers reviews when deciding to do business with a company.
They are what they say and I thank them for that.</Text><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
It has now been a few years since we had our windows installed. The men who installed the windows did an absolute perfect job. One of our windows came in wrong and they ordered and reinstalled the correct window. What bothered me was the salesmen who sold us the windows acted like it was our fault but it was his. We went with this company because he said the owners did not want anyone to be unhappy and always made sure the customer was happy. We are still happy with the windows. We at the time ordered a new front door, we ordered the one we wanted that had a beautiful carved glass insert in the middle of the door. We waited a long time and they brought the door, but it was not what we ordered. They took the door back then called and I would say we were bullied into taking that door, to appease us they put a film on the back of the glass and came and installed it . It was not at all what we originally ordered and it was thin hollow and cheap. When they brought it over we had the hardware for it and they had only made one hole for the lock when I said I needed another hole for the deadbolt they said they couldn't and wouldn't take the time to do it. I could not fight with them at any point I have a heart condition and didn't want to be upset. This company bullies you into accepting what ever mistakes they make and then makes you feel so bad that it takes a long time for you to give a review.  I have thought about how unhappy I was for a long time. I hope if you purchase from this company you have a better experience then I had.</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>This is my review of my experience with American Vision Windows (AVW) We had an issue with some defectively installed windows in the newer home we purchased. The home is a 2016 and we are the second owners but apparently, the initial installers didn’t understand the concept of installing windows square in the opening. We had some windows that left a 1/4” gap when they were “closed” and we could always hear the street noise and feel the wind come through that gap. Some wouldn’t lock...so for both security and climate control, we reported these issues to our home warranty. I mention this because, things don’t always move along quickly when going through a warranty but AVW was patient with us through the whole process. ARMEN came out to explain why their ANLIN brand windows were better than some of the others out there on the market. I liked the idea that I can easily tilt my new windows in for cleaning or... in case of a needed escape they tilt and come out. Later another AVW employee named JACK came out to accurately measure the window openings that needed replaced. Both of these employees alleviated the nervousness of the unknown (whether you’re buying the right window from the right company). They answered all of my questions regarding the windows themselves. When I was directed to get assistance from the office, I spoke on several occasions with Gabriela at AVW. Again, all of my interactions were kind and helpful, especially when I needed help with paperwork that I needed to send into the warranty company.

After a few short weeks we were called to schedule to have our new windows installed. We had LOGAN and NACHO as our two installers and I cant say enough about how Professional, Courteous and Clean they were. Together we walked through the house showing which windows were being replaced. Then, they laid down thick this cardboard material that came on a roll. They cut to fit and placed this on the floor under where they would be working and laid tarps on nearby furniture. Once they removed the defective windows they then hung plastic over the window opening to keep as much debris from coming into our home from the process. They were both careful and considerate with their work. Both told me that they love their work....and it showed in their attitudes and their work value. And there was very little cleanup inside the home once the new windows were put in place. Super pleased with that!

Once the windows were installed, sealed and hand cleaned they went through all of the features of my new windows. Like the tilt in feature earlier mentioned and the safety locks are awesome because I can now open my windows about 2 inches until they meet the pop-out safety lock, and I can keep a breeze coming through and still feel secure. I have to say that of all of the things I love about my new windows.. they are so quiet! No more street noise! And there’s not a hint of air coming through from the outside when they shut. The windows themselves have enough weather stripping but LOGAN and NACHO put so much sealant when putting each one in place that there’s no way I’m going to have any problems with my new windows leaking any air. And no more annoying air drafts. I’m very happy with American Vision Windows and recommend them. I also recommend the ANLIN windows that we purchased through them. I did my research and read lots of reviews about this brand of windows and I’m comfortable with knowing I purchased quality. Go with American Vision Windows and go with ANLIN window brand.< /review>< Pictures>

From him and all the members in our crew, thank you very much for choosing American Vision Windows for all of your window replacement needs!'}<//Resp><text>I just recently had my entire home installed with new vinyl Anlin brand windows, and I am truly happy I went with American vision and let me explain why. As I was going through home renovations, I knew that replacing all the windows in my home was going to be a very large expense towards the home. I went into this patient and diligent, and in fact met 7 other window companies before running into Don at American vision. What actually turned me to american vision was my strong interest in Anlin brand windows. I did tons of homework and read a bunch of Reddit's on reviews of Anlin brand as well as other windows as well such as Milgard, Simonton etc...Once I was officially set with Anlin the next step was finding a credible company to install the windows. A good quality window is only as good as how it was installed and based on my research this was going to be the selling point to whichever company I was going to do the business with. So naturally first thing I checked was Anlin website direct to get a sense of what company does most of their installs. This is essentially how I found American vision windows which from my understanding does the most volume when it comes to Anlin. I submitted the request online and Don was pretty much over the house taking measurements days later. From the get go I was impressed with American vision initially starting with Don. He knew his product but not only did he know his product I can tell he believed in the product. Through my experience I've found when you see a sales rep lack confidence in the product they are trying to "sell" you. This was different Don knew his product and I felt strongly he believed in it and instead he was "helping" not "selling". He was also a straight shooter, was up front about everything, there were no surprises of any sort and it was just overall a nice and smooth business transaction from the get go. Another thank you to Don as well was getting Christian to come out and do the final measurements before the windows went into production. Christian... I was truly blown away from his knowledge and how he goes about making sure we're on the same page. We went over every window, the specs, the model, the whole nine, he suggested how the windows should open for proper functionality, since I got casements so swing left and right was what I wanted so he made sure it all made sense and updated the work order. After Christian took the measurements I truly felt so much more confident in American vision cause you can really tell their was a process to their quality. Final Measuring is probably the most important step of the process and it was really a cool experience to go through that with Christian. Last but not least I have to give a huge shoutout for the entire crew who came out to do the actual install. 3 team's of technicians totaling 8-9 or so and just watching these guys do the work was pretty amazing. Everybody knew their role, how to do their role, and the entire job was completed in one day. I normally don't leave this lengthy of a review but as I was writing it, it all came out so freely because of my actual experience. From me and my family we would like to personally thank Don, Christian, Javier, Sergio, Omar, Aron, Joshua, Emilio and Daniel for truly making our home beautiful and energy efficient with brand new Anlin windows. I highly recommend American Vision for your new window install you will not be disappointed with the quality and integrity they deliver. Thank you again

<text>Steve Huffman from American Vision has been our project manager three times now. We replaced a total of  21 windows, in two homes and have been very happy with Steve and the entire team. They also installed two large sliding doors . The windows have really beautified the homes and made a great difference in their livability. We are warmer in the winter and much cooler in the summer.We are very happy with the Anlin windows, and the price was very reasonable.< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
We had the pleasure of meeting Chris Walker and Guillermo Garcia, both Service Technicians for American Vision Windows.  What amazing young men !!!  First of all they show up on time, introduced themselves, were very polite, professional, knowledgeable and did a fantastic job!  They represent the hallmark of customer service which is very rare these days.  American Vision Windows should be very proud of these young men.

Shortly after their visit we contracted with AVW for a sunroom window replacement project of approximately 14 windows with the final window measurement being taken by Jack last Friday.  It is our hope that the team that installs our sunroom windows are of the same caliber as Chris and Guillermo.   We would like to thank their kind and courteous  Service Coordinator, Michael Ramirez, for coordinating our job with these two top notch techs!

It is our hope that we can write the same gleaming review in 4-6 weeks when the AVW team installs our new Anlin sunroom windows.

Thank you AVW...

<review>For a few years, my wife and I had been thinking about replacing all of the wooden French windows and sliding French doors in our home. I had several contractors come out to measure everything and give me a bid for the work. The prices varied between the different contractors and different brands of replacement product but all were considerably much more than I had wanted to spend.  I keep hearing their commercials on the radio and I decided to call and get a free estimate. I was more than lucky enough to have had Don Adams come to my home. We have a custom home and were very apprehensive about using a company I got from a radio ad. This was not a small job. We have 4 sliding glass doors and 32 window openings. Don definitely knew what he was talking about and gave my wife and I a level of comfort most salesman don’t. When he gave me the price, I was really scared. It was one third of the cost of one of our other bids and considerably less than the others. How could they do the same thing for so much less?

I could not have been happier. Every workman that came into our home was professional, courteous, and clean and knew what they were doing. They took care of our things as though it was the company's owners home. Each time there was an incidence, and there were a few, where they could have gotten away with something that should have been done differently, they choose to do it the right way. They were as concerned as we were that the job was done right.

In the end, we are extremely happy with our choice and would highly recommend American Vision Windows to any of our friends and already have.< /review>< rate>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>It's been 2 years since our installation date. The installers who worked on our house were very nice, worked efficiently and were very clean.

Since then I have been trying to get American vision windows to correct the large mistakes they made in regards to hardware issues i.e shutters and sliding doors that were installed wrong.

I have been in contact with Chris Perez and was working with him for about a year and a half. Then was suddenly transferred to a woman named brandy for 6 months.  Apparently she does not work with the company anymore so my issues have been simply forgotten with no one picking up where she left off ( it's been over two months since she said an installer would be out to finish the job).

In all honesty we don't need that much work done. The reason its taking so long is because " oh I'm sorry it looks like no one ever ordered those parts you needed (that take 2-3 months to come in)" "someone will be in contact with you to schedule a date to install (3 months go by no one calls)",  "oh they ordered the wrong parts", "it seems they only ordered this one part and not all of the rest" , " let me contact the installers and find out what's going on, I'll call you back within the week"  (1 month goes by) "oh sorry we dropped the ball we still need to contact them"

We originally went with this company because the owners seemed genuinely concerned with insuring the quality of their work in their videos.

Hate to brake it to you,  iv been so upset with this company I asked to speak with the owners and i was told " oh they don't deal with customers, so you can't speak with them" you would think after 2 years of being patient with this company and rolling with them dropping the ball over and over again I would be allowed to talk to the owners about what is going on with their company.

So now i have decided I'm going to write a review every day here until either the owners contract me directly or Amerucan Vision Windows officially fixed everything.</Review>< Pics>

< review>
I am very disappointed with the sales rep on his follow up calls.
Had my windows installed on October 7 2017
I noticed one of the sliding glass widow molding had dents on it that you could only see at an angle and also noticed one of the window has the molding coming off. Called the manufacture and told them about these issues and no one from this American vision windows have called us back we have left several messages with the sale man.
The window manufacture has not received any orders of replacement.
Not very happy with them next step Twitter!!!!!!
I have  lost my patients.
These are easy fixes.<//review>

My wife & I were looking for windows. we finally tried AVW. the sales men was super good. they were willing to work with us & none of the others would.
we had our first 3 windows in last June of 2014 and had the last of 13 done this month(March of 2015). it was a pleasurable experience! they called us every step of the was & did everything to make sure it was covenant for us. I would tell any one looking for windows to call them. they were top line from start to finish.</review>

Don and Janelle were super helpful. I met them at a home show, and they were very informative, and knowledgable. I wasn't ready to buy windows at that moment, but when I am, Don and Janelle's great smiles will cause me to buy from American Vision Windows.< /text>

This is the second time I have used American Vision Windows to replace trapezoid windows up high in my house.  The first time everything was perfect.  From the sales person, measuring person and installation.  However the second time around the person that measured the windows measured one upside down.  So the window came in and the installation guys replaced three of the four and said the last one needed to be reordered.  Mistakes happen so this was not a big deal.  I ordered the windows in October 2016.  The three windows were replaced in November just after Thanksgiving.  For some reason the last window did not come in until the second week of January 2017.  I had called Oscar four times (went to voicemail), left messages twice and left two emails.  No return call and no reply email.  I finally called the toll free number and asked to speak to someone and the transfer me to Oscar.  He tells me he is no longer in charge of my account and that it is someone else who he transfers my call to me.  Daniel got on the computer and told me when the window was expected to come in and he was on the mark.  Not sure why I got the runaround but it did get frustrating as I was hoping to have the windows completed way before Christmas so I did not have to move furniture around as much.  I had to move the furniture for the measurements and then for the install and then back for guests and then move them again for the install of the last window.  I realize the measurement was an honest mistake but the lack of communication could have been prevented.  After the great service the first time I was left a little disappointed the second time around.  Especially from a company that was built around customer satisfaction.</Text>

<Review>The advertisements on KFI proclaims that Bill and Kathleen started this business due to a bad service experience that they had with a another window company years ago.  This company is good with their sales follow up UNTIL the windows are installed.  I have windows that are leaking and now I  have inside water wall damage that needs to be addressed.  I have called Daniel the first time no less than three times over a period of 10 days and he finally arranged a service visit to correct my issue only after I was persistent. However, the work performed was incomplete and that was three weeks ago.  Two more calls into Daniel the past two days with no response. I will assume I will need to keep calling everyday until Daniel gets tired of me wanting some customer service.  I am not an unreasonable person however if this were my business I wouldn't be touting great customer service as a foundation when it just isn't true.</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80e82eecc76a1a6f:0x14861a5b0346ded0<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Good prices on Anlin retrofit windows but the outside sales guy was too wound up or anxious. I wanted my windows installed two at a time but he want to do all windows in my house in 1-2 days and according to his installation teams schedule. That's fine if you have an empty house. my house is full, too full to move easy and I need to move my stuff to avoid damage like to a baby grand piano or other heavy equipment like a UGM. They said they could move my stuff but I can't trust that there will be no problems in their hurry to finish job.

I went to VC Home Show and found other window vendors who could do installs on my schedule like two at a time.< /Text>

Signed a contract on April 2nd for 1 french door and 6 plantations shutters over $8,000. Time to complete install was estimated at 6-8 weeks MAX!!

Sept 7th ...5 months after signing the contract and 3 months over schedule and the job is still not finished. We have had to run the project make calls and follow up. Each time we call we have to start from the beginning. We received an email from them today notifying us there was an outstanding payment due. The person who emailed had no history of the project and did not know it was not even finished. We plan on replacing all of our windows in the next 24 months we will not be using American Vision.<//review>

I wanted to make sure you received some feedback on my experience from first setting up the sales appointment through Donna Rennick, working with Gina Perin for the sale, and then dealing with the team that was sent out to install windows throughout my house.  It was all just the most easy and low stress process.

The guys that showed up to do the install were David Daniel, Justin Trent, Jake Mohon and Jose Guzman.  My initial impressions were great.  They showed up on time, they were clean and got to work right away.  My subsequent impressions were even better.  There is a certain expectation whenever you contract with a company to do a big install like this.  At the very least, the product should be what was advertised and the employees installing should know what they are doing.  My expectations were certainly blown away.

Throughout the day I would walk around just to see the progress.  I never found anyone not working.  And working fast!  In addition to their work, they were some of the nicest and most professional people I have ever had come into my house to do work.  I was so pleased with everything that happened yesterday.

Please extend my thanks to the team and make sure you let the manager of these gentlemen know what wonderful representatives of your company they are.  I knew of American Vision Windows years before I called you.  It is obvious that it is through employees like these that you have grown such a great reputation.<//Text>

From start to finish, salesperson to installers, the quality of work was beyond Excellent. They guide through the whole job.  The salesperson explained everything giving options and the pro's and con's of everything (very honest) with reminder e-mails after you made your order until your order is complete letting you know that they have not forgotten about you, to making the installation day totally convenient for you and the installers were efficient, they cleaned up through the whole process and before you know it they are done.  Follow up calls afterward to be sure you were completely satisfied.  I felt like I was looked out for instead of being taken advantage of.  I have seen other companies completed work and it does not compare to the high quality product and look of completion I got.  I would recommend them highly to anyone looking for new windows!<//Text>

Mason was a very smart and respectful guy who taught me a lot about the products and services that AVW offers - to the point where now I'm considering replacing my own Windows!

My wife had spine surgery, and we had an old track sliding door that was always hard to open. This door became even more difficult for her to open,  and I had to keep spraying WD-40 on the track wheels. I am  an ex-contractor with a bad back and  we decided it was time to start shopping around for some quotes on new sliding glass doors. Knowing the old saying you get what you pay for better than most in this field, I wanted to do some research on reputable companies that had been around for a while and would stand behind their warranty's. I checked all the review sites including Yelp, called several companies to come out and give us a quote.  Most of them were guys that must have sold used cars for a living and just gave you the feeling that they would say anything you wanted to hear to make the sale. Our last quote was from American Vision Windows the salesmen was on time, professional and most important was not pushy showed me things about windows I never knew and it was very clear that all the doors we looked at were well made as well as the Anlin doors. The prices were about the same as the other guys it was a no brainer. The salesmen said it would be about 3 weeks out before the door would be ready and he was right on they called to set up the installation time, the guys showed up when they said they would, were very polite, careful and clean. I was amazed it only took them a little over an hour to take out the old one and put in the new one. We were very pleased with the result's. We love our new slider the low-E glass filed with argon gas really makes a huge difference. We no longer have to close the blinds in the afternoon and the kitchen is noticeably cooler in the summer.<//Review>

Awesome to Awful

What a dreadful experience. After many years of great service American Vision Windows Simi has gone way downhill. The last round took seven months and 10 service calls to remedy multiple problems. Project manager Mike Wilson, with whom we have had many years of great service, stopped returning calls, even when I was trying to order more windows from him. I ended up having to hound his assistant Erica Balladarez just to order windows. She was helpful until the problems started and then she stopped returning multiple calls and emails to address the issues. Ian from finance had no problem calling though to collect the final payment, even though the project was still far from complete.

Problems:
1. Windows had been manufactured so that the moving sash was far too small. Meaning it would wobble in the frame and pop out of the frame when opened. This should have been caught before installation. This resulted in 9, in home service calls in order to be resolved. All of which I had to be at home to attend to.
2. I ordered another set of windows to match all the others AVW had installed. Emailing Erica to ensure they were correctly configured to match all of our other windows. Sure enough, no one checked them before shipping them to us and they arrived with vertical grids instead of horizontal grids. I have the email I sent to Erica to ensure they would be horizontal.  Another service call here to get that fixed.
3. Complete lack of project management. One department doesn't communicate with another. Finance had no idea that the project had not been completed. Service had no idea that the project hadn't been completed. Many openly admitted that there was no oversight or management of the projects and folks who weren't tasked with managing had to step in to push the project forward.

What worked well:
1. Chris Walker in service was amazing. He called out the problems early on and pushed to get them fixed. No one listened to him though which is why the project spiraled into 9 service calls. In the end, he was the one who came out and fixed most of the problems.

Overall, I have gone from a happy and solid customer, recommending them to many others resulting in additional sales to one who strongly recommends that they be avoided. What a shame. Such a great relationship crushed by so much carelessness.<//Text>

Please permit me to get promptly to the point.  If you want product, price and professionalism, then I recommend American Vision Windows (AVW).  AVW is the way to go for replacement windows.  Furthermore, service continued after the initial installation.  When two of my windows were broken during a burglary, Armen, Project Manager, came to my home that night and helped me clean up the broken glass and inspected the frames.  Jason, Senior Service Manager, appeared the next morning, measuring and ordering my new windows.  Within a few days, Ryan, the Installer, replaced my windows and left the yard and home without debris.  Now, that's service!  If you're looking for price, product and professionalism, then I hope this review provides you with a vision for life-enhancing value!<//review>

<Text>I put off for years finishing the last two sliding doors and a masterbath window over the tub with new windows.  Each posed a unique problem, due to usage and location. Finally, AVW was recommended to me, Brad Hopper came out with some ideas, designed what I needed and within 4 weeks, I had them installed. Installers were excellent, neat and clean, afterwards i would not know they were there except for the beautiful work.  I could not have been happier.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I had 19 windows installed on 7-7-2012. The windows are GREAT!
I had louver windows in kitchen and living room, if you know what those are, they were installed back in the 60's. I loved everything about those  louver  windows except the cold of winter poured through them and anyone could jimmy them open.
I had gotten a quote from an Arizona company, boy, what a run around they gave me and they not organized at all!!
Don from American Vision Windows came out one day for the quote and sold me on some great windows. I did not want the white windows, I wanted the beige color and they could order them for me. My neighbor just had new windows installed last year, her window's are not the quality or  was there the attention to details of instillation  that mine were and she paid quite a bit more.
The installers from AVW were professional, personable, efficient, friendly,  on time and hard working. There were a couple pieces of furniture that I could not move myself and they took care of it for me. I also have 5 CHICKENS running around the back and side of the house that Cesar and the others scooted around with ease!
Ryan and his crew  said I was on  the top of the list of customers because I bought them pizza and ice cream! They definitively earned it, 19 windows in 6 hours.
I am very pleased with the company and  I am going to have my texture coating done by them. I can't say enough about the company, thanks for advertising on  Mark and Brian KLOS, that is where I got your company name from.
If you are looking for a fair price and great quality and installation call AVW! I am a very happy customer.
THANKS GUYS!<//Review>< pictures>

I called American Vision Windows to ask for a bid to replace 8 very old windows. I already had a very long sales pitch from Sears and a not-so-great contractor from Costco come out. When I called AVW I was a bit skeptical when I spoke with the associate because he quickly suggested that I come into the showroom to see the difference between the windows Costco quoted me and what AVW could offer me at a similar price for a higher quality window.

I went to the showroom and was very impressed by the large selection of windows and the personalized attention. I met with Brad and he provided me with a clear and concise explanation of the windows from Costco and then showed me the windows he recommended for me.

I decided to go with AVW because I really appreciated their excellent customer service. After I purchased the windows someone came out to get the exact measurements to make the windows. About 5 weeks later my new windows were ready for installation. Two very professional installers came out and by the end of the day my new windows were in place! I couldn't believe how neat and clean everything looked after installation. I didn't need to paint or even vacuum!

I am SO happy that I listened to Brad and went with the windows he suggested. I am writing this review from triple digits in Calabasas and my AC running at 82 degrees. The triple paned gas filled windows are keeping my home so cool I am already seeing savings in my electricity bill.

I highly recommend AVW!</text>
