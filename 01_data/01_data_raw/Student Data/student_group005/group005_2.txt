<review>This is an excellent nursery! All the staff are very knowledgeable about the plants they have and can assist you with many of the questions you may have regarding your garden. I was able to build my front yard from scratch with the help of Kings Nursery and have been going back ever since for other perennials, annuals, natives and veggie starts.</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<user>108613912386200892003</user><Text>Cute spot. I’ve come to load up on herbs for my indoor garden and at check out saw they have some house plants too. They always have interesting herb variations and the house plants always look healthy and happy. I purchased a gorgeous hoya from them a few weeks ago and it’s still thriving :) pricier than going to lowe’s of course, but you’re helping to sustain a small local business and getting happy plants too. not everyone has access to shop small/local, but if you do, this is a nice small nursery.< /Text><Time>1595889926508</Time><Gmap_id>0x808447e4b61e7277:0xd94b3197740ffd80< /Gmap_id><name>Dana Falsetti<//name><response>None</response><Rate>5</Rate>< Pics>

I always look forward to a visit to King's. Fantastic selection, plentiful and knowledgeable staff really helps grow this rookie gardener's enthusiasm for sticking a spade in the dirt! Love the humorous ads in the PD as well.</Review>

Dear Kings Nursery of Santa Rosa,

I'm a customer for life because: Your staff greets me as though they're genuinely happy to see me, your plants are well marked as to botanical name along with their care & feeding, your signage indicates a good sense of humor & joy in your work, I get funny & informative emails (but not so many as to be annoying), and you never seem to mind when I say I'm just visiting to admire the plants and see what's new. You've special ordered plants for me and have given good advice about design and planting when I've brought in photos of problem areas.
Another thing is that the products are all fresh & healthy-looking and are arranged in a pleasing manner. The nursery is clean and well-tended. You don't scrimp on staff so there's always help available.
In the future you might consider more public events of an educational nature rather than just the open house parties you've done in the past. Also, I think I only get quarterly emails; weekly would be great especially if you have items on sale. Or even local garden event news. Make yourself even more a part of the local gardening community.
Finally, "local" is important to me. While I occasionally buy dirt at a big box, plants, pots, and seeds are purchased by a locally-owned nursery.<//text>

But, I'm usually in the market for vegetable starts, and I hate to say I find their selection  very limited.  I also find their prices too high for me.  I tend to prefer Imwalle gardens and cottage gardens for the bulk of my starts.  They do carry ladybugs and praying mantis which is great.< /Text>< pics>

This place has been in business since I was a kid.  I always go here to get supplies for my spring gardens.  Their prices are reasonable, and the staff is very helpful.  Best nursery in Santa Rosa.< /Text><user>112749054862231024189< /user><Rate>5<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

Best nursery around, bar none. Stuff you won't find elsewhere, and a staff that actually like what they do. Always a lovely experience spending time at Kings. Keep up the great work!< /Text>

Rather expensive and not a large variety of food plants, but there are some. Excellent selection of roses, ornamental shrubs and bedding plants and an array of different soils and plant foods are available. There is also a fine little gift section.< /Text>

This is one of the coolest nurseries I have been to. The variety is outstanding and I was able to find a bunch of new plants I had never heard of (pineapple sage, raspberry shortcake) that went wonderfully in my garden.<//Text>

<Text>ATTENTION ALL CUSTOMERS WHO NEED
PROFESSIONAL QUALITY ELECTRICAL
HAIR TRIMMERS.
I paid 80.00 for a trimmer and it doesn't work.
I went back to the store the same day and they didnt exchange it.  I got ripped off thinking i was going to get "top of the line TRIMMERS.
Ended up getting ripped off...........
I went to ross and got a better deal for 20 bucks. 2 TRIMMERS scissors and a comb
Same brand.
I should have shopped around.< /Text>< userid>

No Stars ..... the Sallys  in la Puente  are very  rude they followed  me and watched me the entire time
And kept asking me what I'm looking for. one of the workers seen  Caught her looking  for me she just had to laugh.  Even when  I showed more the $100 dollar j and said see I'm shopping just to leave to leave me alone. But no. It didnt work.You would think I was the one person in the store. No I was the only black person
It's sad just because  I'm black  I have to be a thief  and treated  unfairly.

<rating>5</rating><Review>Dr. DeCesare takes much care in adjusting each client. He is thorough, as well as funny, kind and relational. All the staff are just as caring. You feel like family and know you are in good hands. He’s helped and my family through broken bones, pregnancy and postpartum challenges, headaches and allergies ( he even helped my friend with getting pregnant!).
He is very knowledgeable, and prices are very fair, especially for the value of care. His heart is for the hurting and makes care accessible to everyone. Definitely the finest chiropractitor I have known in the Central Valley!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>My back and my right leg was hurting. I couldn’t walk 100 feet, I got pain injection in my back and also went for physical therapy  and chiropractic for three months. Nothing was helping I couldn’t sit and lays down. Always in pain doctor told me I need surgery. Also they said if I don’t do the surgery with in six months I will be paralyzed. I was so stressed out. Finally I went to see him, he saw me for two days a week for two weeks my pain went away I m back to normal. He is amazing, awesome, friendly chiropractic ever find who has magic in his hand.<//Review>< gmapID>

<review>Looking for a family friendly chiropractor?  This is the place. Worth the drive. Small, comfortable, welcoming, friendly. I appreciate Dr. DeCesare for his standard of care for me and my lil baby. And you will not find such great care at such a great price.</review><Gmap_id>0x80948d0734ace065:0x2e98cb2f9b9f3e7< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I have only been with one Chiropractic Doctor and that is Dr.DeCesare, he is awesome and friendly. He has fixed my back everytime I go and screw it up. He basically saved my life from not walking again.< /text>

My husband's family loves Dr DeCesare. I've never been to a chiropractor before and since I'm pregnant and been having some pain I thought I should give it a try. My first experience was great I felt safe and my back felt much better even with just one visit. I'm definitely going back for sure!</review>

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>My boyfriend and I brought our cars here to be cleaned. He has an Audi Q8 and I have a Fiat 500. They told us that neither of our cars would fit in their system. When we all know this isn’t true. They did the same thing to others in previous reviews, when they had brought the same cars here and they fit then suddenly one day they don’t? It makes no sense. They also have a giant sign saying they accept competitor coupons when they accept nothing. It would have been one thing if they were apologetic about the cars “not fitting” and price gouging for a hand wash, but they were rude and unprofessional. We wash our cars weekly and regret trying this place out. Would never recommend. Go to Beach City’s down the street.</Review><username>alexis hagan< /username><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2bada1afd6555:0x3e3636f019ea599d<//Gmap_id><Time>1618165380408<//Time></record>

Second time there. First my car got back with plenty of detail parts dirty. Now I got the "luxury wash" and they return my car like this. I didn't complain because I am really exhausted by people's incompetence or disregard. I'll finish it by myself. If you want a really superficial clean and are too lazy to do it by yourself, and have 20 dollars to trow away, you can go, if not stay away.</Review>

<review>Rude!  Pretty sure they could care less about my business even though I have been loyal for years.
Attendants adjust prices, inconsistent.
Last week I paid 10.00 for mat cleaning.
They didn’t even clean my mats.
This week I went in and they want to charge me 20.00!
I politely decided to leave and the attended just says ok! And waved bye bye...
Bye bye Bonus 🥺</review>< pics>

Wash is nice, but I work in Santa Monica so I stop here on a Fri to save time. Even though I own a truck. The cost is $10-$12 more than Los Angeles prices. I'm afraid to ask how  much a wax detail cost 😨😱. Bottom line folks in SM are getting their wallets ripped off 💸 💸🤑 😢.<//Text>

< Review>
This place has really gone downhill. My third of three bad experiences with a wash here in the last few months. Refuse to do the actual work to fix it and claim you just didn’t pay enough, despite it clearly stating they will vacuum the interior of the car and wipe it down. Car was just detailed 1.5 weeks prior, and was not that dirty coming in except for typical kid stuff. The management is extremely rude and unfriendly from the time you pull in to the wash.< /Review>

They were caught over charging me on top of the already high prices and then the manager became angry and defensive saying he "doesn't care". Now I know why this place is never busy when I drive by. Others have decided to stay away also.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Super disappointed with this place. Will never come again. I payed $70 for interior and exterior clean and got it back with dust and sand still in the floor and on my dash board, and bird poop still on the front. Really?! Go somewhere else.< /Text>< Pics>

Do not go here. They don’t care about quality. Paid $22 for a car wash and waited 20 minutes. They didn’t vacuum the trunk, didn’t clean the middle console, back windows left with streaks - and absolutely no customer service.< /Review>

PLEASE LISTEN TO EVERYONE THAT GAVE THIS CAR WASH 1 STAR!. I am not confrontational.  I'm one of those extreme introverts, so it's hard for me to speak my mind. My white Camry was very dirty due to this uncanny LA weather  . I couldn't take it any more and was passing by so I stopped.  $30.00 for THE WORST car wash ever. They apparently have a quota(watch how quick they dry and wipe down) . Bird poop, dirt and water was running and dripping from my car.  When I asked for him to PLEASE wipe, he appeared to have an attitude.  Mind you, it was pretty busy and it ONLY took 20 minutes.  Shows you how much time they spend on the cars. I am thoroughly disgusted and will never return. (Btw, I stood there using the water from my car to wipe it down. No one even offered help.  I didn't  even bothered to inform the manager, felt it wouldn't do any good.</text>

I love this car wash it is so fast and the price is very fair. Even the most basic car wash will live your car clean and ready to roll. I'm usually in a rush to get to work but this place is speedy. Free vacuum available after your car wash which can extend to reach every part of your car. I've been here twice already and this is definitely my go to.</Text>

When I pulled up, the attendant asked what I wanted and I said a basic wash.  As he was about to write the ticket I informed him I had a coupon.  He then looked at me and said "this car is too dirty yo wash, it will be a minimum of $50".  I really thought he was kidding....  a car too dirty to wash?  What does that even mean?  These guys are scammers with their coupons.  If you have one post what excuse they give you to not honor it.  This car wash is awful!</review>< GmapID>

<Review>Before the car wash I didn't have a dent in my door. After the car wash I did have a dent in my door. The manager claimed it was impossible that it happened there, but it wasn't there before the car wash and was there after the car wash. Refused to give me my money back, only offered a free wash next time, which I refused because why would I go back to a place that damaged my car.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c2bada1afd6555:0x3e3636f019ea599d< /gmap_id><resp>None<//resp>< pics>

The car never comes back entirely clean. They give the car a once over wipe. Whatever is cleaned off is cleaned off and whatever remains is left.

Also never pay full price. The guy always offers deals. You can negotiate and are never sure just how much you are overpaying.

Compared to other carwash places, they at least don't leave towel lint all over the car.< /Review>

Reasonable price and fair cleaning. I can’t say they did a perfect job, but at the same time I took their basic in and out cleaning. The outside was very clean, the inside was just OK. But for the price they charge it is good enough for me to come back here.<//Review>

< Review>
I need a new car wash place.  I have put up with Bonus Car Wash (on Lincoln) rude up-selling practices, BUT now I am not returning.  I paid extra to have the inside of the car cleaned....they did a poor job, but I decided to let it go...UNTIL I looked in the back of the car...where the plastic areas had NOT been touched at all.  Drove there to show them the problem..and  what i got was "come back on Thursday when the manager is in". I asked if I could get a card, so I could call and was told to look it up on the internet! Not the place to go if you want customer service.< /Review>

<Review>I brought the car in for specific issue that needed to be cleaned driver door, radio, inside windshield and other places. It is convertible and the top was down. When they gave me the car...none of what needed to be cleaned was done. They fought with me and said because of the issue it would cost an additional $100. When I got home and put the top up...they had not cleaned it or the back window. The manager was rude about it. They also kept speaking in Spanish when not speaking to me.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

I've given this place multiple chances as it's right across the street from my house and super convenient, but I definitely won't be going back after this last time. I'm nearly positive they just upsell people on things (tire shine, sealer, etc) but don't actually relay the information to the people that are finishing the job, so the products you purchase don't actually get applied. I requested that they remove some residue from a sticker that was on my windshield and was told it was "no problem". I also was upsold tire shine. Neither of these things were completed when I got my car back. I've also been super disappointed with the quality of the clean on more than one occasion. Dirt that clearly should have been wiped up/vacuumed up. Just not very thorough. Definitely not worth the money.< /Text>

<Text>My experience at this place has been ok.  Better than some car washes, but by no means the best.  The best thing they have going for them is that the employees are unionized, so presumably getting fair wages.  What I don't like: the up-sell pitch they give you.<//Text><userid>100923408543324251142</userid>< gmap_id>

<Text>Came in today with a big problem, when an approximately 10 inch wide splotch of fresh sap landed on my hood while parked at the nearby Sunday Farmer's Market. The gentlemen in the check-in line took the time to carefully remove the sap and buff out the hood, with no residual damage visible. The wash itself was no better or worse than anyone else's wash, but I'm giving them give stars for their emergency service!<//Text>< Rating>

Almost a 1/2 hour
But the best car wash in town
Since they closed Wilshire / 25th
Nice selection of greeting cards in their gift shop
Excellent coffee
Anyone in a wheelchair would be very comfortable here, they seem to have gone to great lengths to make it fully accessible
Also, sparkly clean
I like that they offer gas too< /review>< response>

If you want get your new car damaged by Bonus Car wash and pay for the damage yourself -Bonus Car wash is the place to go. Took my new BMW for wash they broke my reflector.  Had to wait for 10 days and drive around with missing part.  Today I found myself in the area and my car was very dusty so I went back to give this place another chance.  Secured my reflectors with the tape to prevent from breaking.  Manager Rafael, started yelling at me that if they break any parts of may car or damage it I will pay out of my pocket.  He clearly told me never come back.  Good luck with your business of yelling at your clients and breaking their new cars, Rafael!<//text>

They do a great job. Not the cheapest but inside/outside and washing of the undercarriage. For a truck it's like $20.</review>

They said they would spray all the dust out which they didn't, they did not a do a good job of vacuuming the car. The outside was pretty well done though, I personally wouldn't come here again.</text>

I have a Tesla and the front guy told me that it can't be a regular wash, it has to be an outside hand wash. I'm experienced with car washes, a friend of mine owned a few of those and I know for a fact that a machine wash is just as good - no difference in terms of scratching, etc. I asked him why and without blushing or blinking an eye, he immediately answered that the tunnel is too low for a Tesla.

I have no problem to pay $25 vs $14 as you can tell but I hate being lied to in the most blatant manner. I just got back into my car and left for the other car wash on Lincoln (Millenium). Don't do business with scammers. It's a matter of pride and justice. Never going back.<//Review><Name>Yuri Baranov<//Name>< date>

Update: got home and it took me literally 10 seconds with some rubbing compound to fix the paint. What a joke. Never again. Unhelpful, lousy service. Go elsewhere.<//review>< userid>

<Text>DONT GO TO THIS PLACE

The worst place for washing car. When I went the guy told me no problem you can wash your car but if it's raining come back on Friday for free wash and if you forget your receipt bring the yellow stamp. So I came back friday with my stamp and an other guy told me that I have to bring my receipt so I went to my home took my stuff and when I came to the car wash the guy told me sorry we can't wash your car !!!!

<review>I live 2 blocks away from this place & just cant go here anymore. The place is run totally sketchy. They talked me into buying a booklet of prepaid basic car washes & the benefit was you get 1 free car wash (the 11th)  which equates to a little over 10% off for them. Every time I use one and I don't upgrade the basic wash they actually warn me that the basic wash isn't that good. Before I bought the booklet the basic was fine but when you redeem the coupons they do a very noticeably bad job like today they put the garbage back in my car instead of throwing it away!!!! It was just a couple paper bags & a dry cleaning plastic bag both on the floor balled up, but still. AND I was second in line and they let me car sit for almost 20 minutes!! & pulled 7 cars that came in after me thru and waited till there were No More cars before they even started vaccuuming my car. Totally scam place,  really low grade job and there are 2 other cars washes with in a half mile in both directions -
Lincoln Car Wash
1624 Lincoln Blvd
Santa Monica, CA 90404
&
Bonus Car Wash
2800 Lincoln Blvd
Santa Monica, CA 90405

Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this ghetto low grade bad service lazy place!!< /review>< Rating>

Good public course with reasonable rates. Beautiful scenery and maintained fairly well. The only downside I would say is that they don’t monitor pace of play. It took us 3.5 hours to play 14 holes. We ended up leaving due to darkness. We paid a twilight rate so that is ok. However, lots of hurry up and wait. If you go, try and go on off hours. It will be worth it.<//text>

< Review>
my favorite golf course! not only close to home, but also challenging enough to place your shots correctly. i think what makes all the difference is the beauty of the fairways and trees, trees,trees, equal shade, shade,shade. also  one of the nicest public putting greens around. there is no charge for practicing your putting.<//Review>

< review>
Just played last sunday.  the pace was better than i've ever seen but the course was not in great shape.  anywhere around the greens was like hitting off dirt.  the greens were good and the staff is always great but the fairways are terrible and anywhere around the green you might as well putt.  not sure how they can keep charging this prices for a course that gets worse every year.

played again this last sunday 4/11/21 and it is the same.  terrible fairways and hitting out of the sand is like hitting of a sidewalk.  I'd be embarrased to tell people I was the greenskeeper here.<//review>

<text>Great time here at Simi Hills.

The course is in fantastic shape.   The greens rolled perfectly, without a ball mark on them.

The entire staff is exceedingly friendly and more than willing to make your experience great.

I'd highly reccomnend.<//text>< gmapID>

Excellent golf course, well priced, well kept greens, only issue area for short game practice needs upgrading.  Other than that, awesome course.< /text>

A very nice course for the money.  Long and wide fairways makes for a fun game, especially if you don't golf regularly.</review>

(Translated by Google) For us who are busy playing our favorite golf for only one day on Sunday, it is a really grateful course to have a backline on weekdays. In particular, Simmy Hills is comparable to a private golf course that shows how well many staffs manage the grass from dawn.
I feel grateful by myself.
But one thing... I don't think I can't do it if I feel uncomfortable at the counter where many golfers first face a well-managed golf course.
At a fixed time, there is no fair pay, nothing to make each other feel bad.
If you correct this, I think it is the best golf course in the valley.

좋아하는 골프를 일요일 하루밖에 칠수없는 바쁜 우리에게, 평일날 백라인이 있다는건 정말 고마운 코스다. 특히 씨미힐스는 새벽부터 많은 스텝분들이 얼마나 잔듸를 잘 관리하는지 웬만한 프라이빗 골프장과 비교해도 손색이없다.
저절로 고마운 생각이 든다.
하지만 한가지... 이렇케 많은분들이 애써서 관리 잘된 골프장을 많은 골퍼들이 첫 대면하는 카운터에서부터 기분이 언짠아 진다면 안될것 같으다.
정해진 시간에, 정당한페이, 서로 기분 나쁠일이 전혀 없는데 유독 씨미힐스 카운터는 정말 다르다.
이점만 시정하면 밸리에선 최고의 골프 코스라 생각한다.

Character's offers a pretty complete menu along with specials at very reasonable prices. You have to eat to drink which is fine as it's the smart thing to do.  Come check out their specials and the "hot older chicks"... hahahaha< /review>

Have never been asked if I would like to eat.???
Go figure 🤗 Still: Great place, neighborhood staple.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Tried to buy soda and play pool with my friends (We don't drink) the bartender was really rude and said we were not spending enough money to play pool.  So we left. Money from us playing pool and buying soda is better than nothing. He made us feel very unwelcome and uncomfortable. Women should be able to just go out and play pool.</text>

Jim, I believe if the individual is not strong enough to show his name then his comments are without merit. B/C of this and the other obviously true comments, I will be making my first order from you tomorrow and I, also as a long term small business owner, appreciate and trust your comments more than a whiner.

The staff is extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Every time I go in, I've gotten to sample a flavor of the protein powder before purchasing it, & the girl at the counter is always really friendly. I don't feel like I'm being judged, or pushed into buying something I'm not interested in. The staff is always eager to educate me on products I have questions about. I have so much love for this store! I've spread the word on how great this store is!</Text>

This store is great!! All of the employees are super knowledgeable and helpful, and really work to find out what your fitness goals are, so that they can recommend the best products to help you achieve those goals. It's a really great, veteran-owned business that publicly supports all of our armed and emergency services members. So you can get all your fitness supplements AND show support for the men and women who keep us safe, all in one place! Love it!< /review>

Max Muscle Visalia is great....Thank you Talon for all your help.  Really like the Cleanse and Lean and Emerge that was recommended to jump start my weight loss.  Taste great (love the Cherry Tart Emerge) and I trust the information I've been given.  They always have the clients best interest at heart.  Customer for life</text>

Love that it's veteran owned and that all the products are sourced and made in the USA-- and everything is delicious! Apparently the Max Muscle brand has been winning taste awards for over a decade. EXTREMELY knowledgeable and caring people at that store. Even the layout of the store is way more welcoming than other supplement stores. Their Inbody 570 machine measures fat surrounding internal organs, which I'd probably have to have doctors orders for and go to a medical facility to check otherwise. Oh, and all military and first responders get 20% off all the time!?!?! Too cool. Way to give back, Max Muscle Visalia.</Text>

I had a great experience at Max Muscle in Visalia. As soon as I walked in I got a friendly greating. The owners are genuinely nice people and are very easy to talk to. They are definitely knowledgeable about their products. It is important to them to educate you on what supplements you are trying to get. If you don't know what you need, then just tell them what your fitness goals are and they can tell you what supplements are right for you. Over all I loved my first experience there and do plan for this store to be my go to whenever I need supplements to reach my goals! Thanks Max Muscle for all your help! Greatly appreciated!<//Review>

<text>I had been trying to lose weight for a while with hardly any results and after talking with Talon I realized I was doing it all wrong! That buff mofo knew exactly what I needed to do to get the results I wanted and the supplements he recommended were exactly what I needed. trust me this guy knows what hes talking about and I highly recommend him for any sort of fitness, exercise, diet or whatever questions you may have. thanks Talon #MaxMuscleVisalia<//text>< pics>

The thing I like most about this place, is they take the time to explain exactly what you need, why, and alternatives as well. They will speak to you for hours until all your questions are answered and the knowledge behind the company is amazing, as a fitnes professional, and someone who's been in the fitness industry for years I highly reccommend coming here. They know exactly how to reach certain and specific goals. From coming here and using the tools, advice, and knowledge they've provided for me, I have gotten astonishing results. THANKYOU AGAIN!!<//Review>

<text>Great discounts Tallon is very knowledgeable. Always great customer service. Max muscle Visalia is not like other supplement stores where they just want you to buy stuff and leave they want you to achieve your goals and be healthy doing it.

<rate>5< /rate><review>This campground is the bomb. It is run by a wonderful campost named Manny who is extremely helpful. He keeps a close eye on the campground and is also very nice man friendly and outgoing. You might get a spot during the week but forget weekends I think they're booked out forever. My rig took a dump when I arrived but Manny  helped me get in touch with a tow service and shop to get it fixed even using his own cell phone to make all the calls since mine was not working very well in that area.</review>< pictures>

This campsite was in a beautiful spot with a great day use area. There is a loud train that comes every so often to be aware of.

The host, Manny, was extremely friendly and helpful as well! He told us the good fishing spots and helped us fix our car when the undercarriage needed repairs.

Even with the train, it was a great trip!< /review>

Neatly maintained small campground with clean pit toilets. Bring your own soap. There is a small swimming area for kids, by the day use parking lot near site 23. Trains run on the other side of the creek every half hour or so, day and night, and the loud noise will probably wake you up. Good place for one night during transit.< /Text>

<text>to start the camp host totally not friendly, in a very rude way, he asked us what we were doing there, not even hello how are you or welcome to Spanish Creek.
And we had reserved that spot,
He treated us like we were going to steal or something like that.
At the next day he told us and the guests in a bad way, do not do campfire because there were regulations, I understood  but there is a different way of saying or explaining.
Then he asked us to go and buy supplies for him  from the market, he says that the guests become friends with them so that they can buy supplies for him, that's not right and also very annoying noise. guy
We went for many years there when Mr. Tom was,  camp host is no longer there.
Now we don't come back anymore. I recommend Caribou Campground is very close.
The name of the Camp host is Alan excellent person, very friendly and nice guy.
Remember not matters if the campground is nice if the camp Host is unfriendly person and annoying.</text>< pics>

Horrible!  I don't usually write reviews, but when I drove over 2 hours away really early in the Morning for what was supposed to be a first come first serve campground during the week last Week,  my mom daughter and I were greeted with a rude host coming up to my truck pretty Much like what do we want and there were no vacancies, but he then asked who's staying the 3 of you we might have a spot. When I responded I had to go pick up 2 more family he immediately said everything is taken. So I asked why does the website say 1st come 1st. serve and was showing 3 vacancies and I tried to call; he said everyone says that they can not get through. So I asked to drive around  to leave as we Had to drive around the circle and there were  3 spots open like the website said. When I drove back to the front to ask about it he said they were taken but There were no Tags on the  Posts. We felt like he picks and choses who's stays there.  He was extremely rude to us. It was a horrible experience< /review>

Lots of spots at the group campsites. Parking was a non issue. They let you park anywhere on the side of the very wide road.</Review>

<text>Pulled at the last minute and Brenda got us registered right away.  She did warned us about the noisy trains at night and offered us earplugs.  Other then the train the place enjoyably quiet and not crowded.  Nice big swimming area for the kids.< /text><gmap_id>0x809d01dd7f11fc39:0x6a4599e607793a62< /gmap_id><userid>102303575524299919942</userid>< time>

Quieter than the lower, at least during the time we were there. I also felt that the upper loop was shadier than the lower one. Water faucets are only by the bathrooms. Some campgrounds were big and shady, but some not, especially if you tent camp, either the ground is not level or no shade, or only enough space for a small tent. Personally, I did not like the sites #9 (upper loop) and #13 (lower loop) at all. The swim hole was great (lower loop). Rocky beach. Walking distance from the upper loop down/up steep road. Train goes by but it was not bothersome to us. Most campgrounds had RV driveways, but there were a few of them where the cars had to be parked on a side. So read the descriptions very carefully. Great campground. We will definitely be back.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Beautiful place near the river. Problem is, you will not catch any sleeps. The campground is in a valley surrounded by train tracks. Trains go by any time during the day or NIGHT and the sounds seems like you are living in a sci-fi movie. If you care about tranquillity, I will not suggest to stay here.
Bathroom are clean and camp host is nice.< /Review>

It's a beautiful campground on the river. A lot of nice spots. When I was there in August it was sparsely populated. There is a railroad track nearby. Other reviewers have noted that trains to go by in the middle of the night and surprise, they're loud. I would say that's a small inconvenience for your stay< /Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Would give no stars if possible but will give one just to be able to post. Will never stay here again. Was originally told it was no problem having a few extra people in our camp site. The next night it absolutely unacceptable. We were told we had to move people to another site and had until 10pm to do so which was not a problem. Then camp host called sheriffs at about 7 because we hadn’t moved yet. Completely unprofessional behavior and will never be back and never recommend.</Review>< pics>

Great spot for railfans: just a few minutes from the Keddie Wye, and many trains run along the creek.  Camp host (Tom, i think) was a super friendly, stand-up guy.

<text>Campsite was fine. There's train tracks directly across the river and they're viciously loud. Woke up 4-5 times a night to slow moving freight squeeling down the the tracks. Surprised that no one's mentioned that part. Would not recommend.<//text><resp>None< /resp><name>Ryan Stickler< /name>< time>

The pictures that are shown for this place aren't even accurate. Spanish Creek Campground is located in the canyon off of Feather River Hwy. There are 2 levels to the grounds, with 10 up top and drive down further for the last 10. There are about 6 camp spots that sit directly on the river. There is a beach at the river with a fantastic swimming hole.  Bring a floatee and spend the afternoon hanging out. I wish someone would have reviewd on that. Because it was fantastic and we didn't bring any toys to play with in the swimming hole. This spot is such a great spot to swim that even the Quincy locals go there. Off of camp spot 6 there is a trail that takes you down to an old mining claim. If spot 6 is empty you will see "the road" within the trees. We followed it down to an old dam and fished there. It's funny to me how different people's experiences can be. I loved the camp hosts; the older couple were friendly and they answered all my questions. This is an old campground, so there are vaulted toilets and water faucets at the toilets, not at the sites. There are bear boxes. One little thing, there are train tracks that sit high above you in the trees, and that train drives by at least 6 times a day. It's not too evasive but for some it may be . Also, some of the sites are pretty close together. Best sites are #6, #8, #16, and #20.</text>

Would give a zero if I could. We pulled in and didn't even want to stay and camp after chatting with the camp host for 2 minutes. He was very degrading and stand offish. He kept shutting me down while trying to ask questions. Needless to say we left and drove another hour to find a more welcoming place to stay.</text>

The return staff was rude. They charged an extra day because their parking lot was full and we were unable to return the car with the drop box on Sunday.
The girl walked away when we were talking to her and refused to give us a receipt.<//review>

I first learned of this Enterprise location from a neighbor. He recommended that I try this branch as he has rented from it several times. Now I’ve rented from this same office four times and have always been pleased with the service. It’s a busy small storefront that cycles a lot rentals, but its convenient location makes up for that. And despite the attendant presssures, Jose and his personable staff always do their best to accommodate everyone, including shuttling you to and from the branch when a staff person is free.
On the one occasion when I did have a small complaint with the vehicle, Jose handled it quickly and professionally.
Also, the vehicles have always been newer models with relatively few miles. So that’s always nice.
I will always call this location first when in need of a rental car.

Thanks, guys.

<userid>109554681713657173350</userid><Review>Great service (hence the 2nd star). However, they saddled me with a "non-smoking" car that was apparently previously occupied by a chain smoker, and then filled with Fabreeze to cover it up. At the end of the day my clothes smell like smoke and people are asking me if I took up smoking. Disgusting. I have no doubt that they would change it out for me, but I do not have the time and am not in the area often. When specifically requesting a non-smoking car, they needed to consider what they give out. Two little "No Smoking" signs in the car do not magically turn it clean.<//Review>< gmapID>

I just had a “Twighlight Zone” episode play out at this Enterpise branch.

I dropped off a vehicle that I had rented.
After my wife and I got home we received a call from the branch manager, Jose Guadarrama, who signed me out when I picked up he vehicle. He proceeded to tell me that there was damage on the rear bumper.

To my complete and utter shock I drove back to the branch to see what he was talking about. I come to find out that the damage in question was on the back quarter panel. Someone had done some pretty amateur body work on the car, and I was being blamed for it.

If it had been me I would have happily made the claim on my insurance, or paid for it outright. I would not have gone to the trouble of covering it up with my own body work. I wouldn’t even know how to begin to do any kind of body work.

Jose stopped short of calling me liar by saying that the car was perfectly fine when I took the vehicle.

I ask future customers. If you were doing a walk through on a car would you point out body work that wasn’t the best body work in world? Would you think to? Would you even be looking for that?— I highly doubt it!!!

This felt terrible. As if I’m some kind of cheat or lair. My parents raised me better than that!

I’ve always been a loyal Enterprise customer. And was happy to learn that there was a branch near my house. Sadly I will never be using Enterprise again.

Again, I ask would you notice this on a walk through? NO - you wouldn’t!!! If they wanted to do poor body work on their vehicles is that your business.<//text>

<Text>Fabulous service...EVERY time. They always have a car, and time to rent takes much less time than Thousand Oaks Blvd location. Staff is personable and professional. Other locations should take lessons from this branch!

Update: when new branch mgr came in around 2-3 months ago, I dont rent there anymore, not customer friendly and 2 cars that came to pick me up wreaked of smoke. Mgrs excuse was we cant take cars off the line because they smell like smoke it would be too expensive for company. Guess they dont care about customer health!</Text>< Pics>

<rate>1</rate><text>I wanted to rent a car for two days. I called Enterprise and arrived at their car rental location in Thousand Oaks. They told me that they didn't have cars left, so they persuaded me to rent a Ford truck. I took the truck and the next day I returned the truck to LAX airport, which was the agreement. We flew out of LAX that evening for Florida. A week later I received an e-mail from the girl who persuaded me to rent the truck, saying that the vehicle had not been returned and to please call her in the morning to update the status, as she did not want to charge me more than what was on the agreement. I tried calling the next day The voice mail said, "the # you are trying to reach can't reached right now ,try it later. "After two days of worrying. I called Enterprise headquarters and gave them the receipt information for the time the vehicle was returned at LAX. I was told the vehicle had been returned and the person connected me to the girl who rented me the truck. I spoke to her and she said it was a computer glitch. She had me worried for two days for nothing and when I tried to call her back I couldn't reach her. She deliberately called me and made herself unavailable. I think that she should not have that job. I will never rent a car from Enterprise again.<//text></record>

<review>Awesome products! I purchased a coolant filtration kit for a 2003 f350 6.0 and a bunch of random stuff to go with it. I was amazed at the stuff that filter collected. The product packaging was very impressive as well.

<review>Sinister Diesel is the place for do it yourselfers. I have ordered most of my parts from them and have always had a pleasurable experience. In fact I plan to order much more in the future. They always have their "Sinister Diesel" brand parts on sale which is a nice touch and the parts come in a timely manner. I would recommend sinister diesel to any one who wants to do it themselves and save on quality parts.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXOThnlWb2-BDQo6GWObNDsxwLn4AChftGHI9o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1Wwf46PnEa-ob0m2Wnw9G95rVmifl15UMV5L6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-00ZIeY2KHEmALB2V7qt0W27u6dmpDNxSuZ7l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I purchased the master solutions kit with the edge evolution cs2 tuner and a charge pipe kit from sinister diesel. Had a few issues and contacted the customer service dept. They were amazing and extremely helpful and professional. Still waiting on my charge pipes but that's fine because they are hand made and quality is worth the wait. Would definitely recommend them to anybody.< /Review>

<review>Very easy ordering process, very well designed website and a good selection of aftermarket parts. The only issue I had is the exhaust I ordered is a month and a half out on backorder. You know the availability is not the fault of sinister Diesel, however, never during the order process did it warn me there was a back order nor are there any statuses about availability with any products. Would have been good to know in advance if what I was ordering was actually there. The other half of my order was set to ship 5 days ago but I have not received a tracking number or confirmation of shipment.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I took my truck into the Ford dealership to get my truck looked at. I was told it would cost me $5,000+ for them to do injectors and pump on my truck. Sinister Diesel had a deal on injectors and a pump. All the parts I received are packed excellent and of high quality. They saved me a lot of money in parts doing it myself. I placed an order and paid for the return postage for the core on the injectors when I placed my order. I didn’t notice at the time but the system charged me postage for each injector. I placed the order on a Friday night and Monday morning I received a phone call from Sinister Diesel explaining the problem and letting me know that the money for the extra postage would be returned to my card right away. They easily could not have done anything and waited to see if I would call and say something. That to me shows that they care about the customer and will take care of them. I will go with them anytime I can and would recommend them to everyone!<//Text>

<text>They sold me BD injectors which 1 failed within 7000 miles. The advertisement did not state they were remanufactured. When I asked for my money back they told me I should have known they were remanufactured. Becareful what you buy. Their listings are disingenuous.< /text>< rate>

<text>Unfortunately the purchase experience wasn’t great. I placed my order and received a confirmation email, that’s great, however after one week... then 2 weeks absolutely no communication on my order. I sent several emails asking when it may ship or what the status was.... nothing. No response and no communication. Going on a month now and I still have no clue when my order will ship?? Or what’s even going on..... I don’t mind waiting for the parts to be built but for god sakes at least communicate or reply to me... hopefully I’ll eventually  get my parts. One day...</text><resp>None<//resp>< user_name>

Quality parts and the shipping is fairly quick!  I would recommend them for all your diesel needs. I have ordered thousands of dollars worth of parts and have not been disappointed in the quality of the parts and service.</text>

Love the blue color and the wide selection of tailored products.  Haven't installed my cone filter yet but it arrived quickly enough and I did get shipping and order confirmation emails.  Timing was a bit slow bit nothing major.  Looking forward to getting the parts in...but I have to get my Excursion back from the mechanic first 🤣< /Review>

What any true diesel enthusiast needs. That patented blue really makes a statement. It offers high level dress up and extreme functionality. You can’t go wrong with Sinister Diesel parts. Hell it saved my marriage.<//Text>

These guys were very helpful in figuring out what size injectors I needed for my truck.  They also recommended other products to go along with to prolong the life if my injectors.  Thanks and I will be getting more products from you.</text>

I purchased a fuel cap plug for my 2018 Ram diesel. It is a quality product. It fit perfectly and sure beats the red plastic coffee scoop that it came with!</Review>

<text>I bought a coolant/oil filtration system for my 6.0 powerstroke and the fit and finish was outstanding. The directions were some of the best I've ever used with very clear color pictures on the thick paper so if oil or coolant got on them you could just wipe it off. The only issue I had was that quite a few items were missing from the kit, all the hose clamps, 2 bolts for the filter housing block and a hose retaining clamp. Luckily I have a shop and had all these things anyway but just make sure to check before you install this!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< GmapID>

<Review>Bought two fuel caps for my new truck. Really liked the looks of the Sinister ones. Shipping and communication was great especially since everything is going a little unpredictable with Covid. Once I unboxed one of them and put it on I was very satisfied. Hopefully they make a DEF replacement for the 2020 Rams soon, will definitely purchase that as well.<//Review>< rate>

I called Sinister to get the "O" Ring size for a commonly known failure part in the their 6.7 Cummins EGR Delete Kit.  I was told that the "EPA" took all of their "manuals and knowledge".  What a joke, they couldn't even tell me the size of the O Ring that I needed to purchase for their product that failed.  Disappointed.<//text>

Ordered a cold air intake for a 2019 F350 6.7 and fits perfectly. Beautiful color on the piping. After I received my cold air intake and installed then I received an e-mail saying if you ordered a cold air intake you get a cleaning kit for free. I called the customer service and they were willing to send me one for free since it was the very next week after I ordered mine. . Highly recommend. . I know I will spend a lot of money with them<//text>

Was on the fence about buying a bypass oil kit, but with 10% off the other weekend, I decided to pull the trigger. Sinister products might get a bad rap based on the past (never on quality), but I’ve had nothing but good experiences with them. The bypass oil and coolant filter kit is of excellent quality and a very clean setup. The blue aluminum looks great and the mount keeps everything clean.</review>

<username>Micah Gamponia</username><Text>Finding the products I wanted was very easy, but the time elapsed between the date ordered and the date shipped was longer than than expected. I later found that one of the items ordered was still going through manufacturing, and that was all okay. The only problem was that I wasn’t informed so until I called to figure out what was going on with the other part of my order. It would’ve been nice to get a heads up before I started wondering if the delivery guy ended up with my parts.</Text><Time>1590469193542< /Time><rating>3</rating>< user_id>

Would be 0 if possible. Wont support their products, and customer service is a joke. Talk down on you for owning an "illegal"  product, they JUST sold you 10 months ago. All I needed was a replacement O ring, would not even provide the size of O ring. Also, tried to up sell to another product, without providing any relief that the product I just bought is now illegal. Will not be in business long.</Text>

Customer Service wasn’t the best in sending me the right bracket. It took me over a week for them to approve it to send the new bracket. I called several times and they kept saying the representative that’s working on that is out but I’ll call you tomorrow when I find something out. Never got a call and had to call back. They finally shipped the new bracket and expedited it so I’m happy about that. But I just thought it could have been done quicker.

<text>Outstanding service and quality! I ordered an injector driver module for my 7.3, it came with extremely detailed instructions as well as a form telling you how to test your electronics/harness for faults before installing so you don't risk damaging your new product! Did the testing and installed and she runs like a dream! Will only shop Sinister Diesel for all of my diesel needs!< /text>< Pics>

I ordered the cold air intake for my 6.7 powerstroke. It deleted the entire tube and the turbo resonator, now I can hear the turbo spool up and it sounds great. I will be ordering more parts from Sinister.< /review>

Quality products throughout the whole site.  The website is set up well and easy to use.  The purchase process was easy and they were very fast with the shipping.  The parts I ordered got to my house in two days.  Will order from there again.< /Text>

<Review>Sinister Diesel never disappoints, I own a 2004 excursion with the early 6.0 and I have invested in the oil and coolant bypass filters as well as the blue spring upgrade with the billet housing and the billet oil filter cap and oil fill cap, all working like a charm and no dislikes about any of it, delivered on time as well.< /Review>< user>

<review>Steering box support made a huge difference in our Dodge 3500. The float you would feel when we went over bumps is so much better with this on. Highly recommend this steering stabilizer.<//review>< pics>

<text>They make a really solid product. I bought the blue spring fuel pressure regulator kit with billet cover from them for my 6.0. Works flawlessly and the billet cover looks great under the hood. I will be going back to them for a few more things over the next couple months. I have many friends running all kinds of different sinister parts on there diesels and I haven't heard one bad thing.

Sinister Diesel had everything I needed in a one stop shop.   Website was easy to use and finding what I wanted was a breeze.  When the 5" stainless steel system came in,  it arrived in good condition and all parts were there. Assembly was flawless and the sound it produced is amazing.<//review>

This was my third order from Sinister. This purchase was for a 5" Turbo back exhaust system for my 2006 Ram 2500. Perfect fit and finish. System doesn't have instructions but if you can't figure it out you probably shouldn't be working on your truck in the first place. Shipping and customer service has always been first rate from Sinister.<//text>

Ordered the cold air intake for my 2018 F-250 6.7L Turbo Diesel. It was delivered in just a few days, installed in under 30 mins, and it looks and performs great! Gives my truck a nice deeper sound and you can really hear the turbo whistling during acceleration and decelerations. Great product and service!< /review>

<text>Never really shopped with Sinister Diesel but I don’t have any complaints from my past two purchases. Shipping has been fairly fast and the products I received were OEM and they were cheaper than most other online sites.</text>< pics>

<Text>By far the best customer service, also fastest shipping in hard times with covid going on. Definitely would recommend this company for any diesel supporters. I have a 07 powerstroke and will definitely be buying all my parts from sinister, also have a 99 5.4 f250 that will be getting an upgrade to a 7.3 so more parts will be purchased for that as well.</Text>< Name>

I ordered a new Pitman arm for my lifted 6.7L power stroke, it can decently quick just one day behind and they offered me a partial refund which was great. Also the part fit perfect and fixed my play issues.< /Review>

I ordered an exhaust system from Sinister Diesel, I got an order confirmation e-mail from them right away. I heard nothing further for a week, I was expecting to get a shipping confirmation e-mail within seven days. It was an in stock item, their site mentioned nothing about back order. So I called them, they told me that they sent me an email saying that my exhaust would ship in one or two weeks. I never got that e-mail, but I was fine with a week or two. I heard nothing for three weeks, so I called again. Then they said the soonest it could ship would be in another three to five weeks. I just wanted to buy what seemed to be a high quality exhaust system. I wanted to give them my money for a product, they ended up keeping my money for three weeks and I got no exhaust. I just wish they had been honest from the beginning, honesty goes a long way. They wasted my time.< /Text>

The quality and the details in this product are extremely impressive, I ordered 4“ to 6” chrome exhaust tips and they blew me away on the craftsmanship and there definitely not made cheaply there strong and I believe they’ll be on the truck for a very long time, i would highly recommend sinister diesel to anyone<//text>

<Review>I love the sinister diesel cold air intake that I bought.  But when I chatted online with tech which was helpful come to find out that it is an oiled air filter.  The oiled air filter is fine but I spent $399 on the intake which comes with the filter but after spending that much for for that setup one would think that they would give you the oil for the air filter.</Review>< Rate>

Ordered parts for a 2009 Cummins through sinister just a couple weeks ago. After having parts from a competitor on another diesel truck we own, I wanted to try some of theirs. Difference in quality isn't even close. Very high quality, well made parts. Shipped the day after I ordered and arrived at my door in 5 days. I will be using Sinister again in the future.< /Review>

Great service, from the parts to the time they get to you in. I had worked with a few other diesel part dealers, wasn’t real impressed, but Sinister diesel was definitely different I was all around very pleased. Prices to shipping to returns, well rounded. Had to return a gasket kit, wanted to keep the head studs, they were more than happy to help!< /review>

I was very impressed with how fast the shipping was and the customer service I had. I took advantage of their blue Friday (Black Friday) deals and was a huge discount.  Haven’t been able to install all my products yet but everything that was described is what I received.

I just ordered the hot boost pipe for my Fordf250. It’s very well built. Holds boost pressure with no issues pushing a stage 3 turbo. Swapped the Intercooler with the pipe. I loved the results<//review>

It has been a month and my alternator ($600.00) still has not been delivered. I tried emailing and calling them multiple times and they won't return any of my messages.

It would be nice if they would at least contact me saying it will be late.</review>

<Text>Fast shipping and amazing company, exhaust looks great, and was very easy to install (Took maybe 45 minutes including cutting the first piece to correct size). Does not change the sound much, but it’s also just a DPF back exhaust. Piece that connects to the DPF has to be cut according to your truck model.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Great products, and excellent service. My items arrived quickly and I’ve had no issues with the items I’ve installed. Well worth the prices, due to quality and durability of everything. Not to mention, my truck looks awesome with all that blue under the hood. 10/10 recommend Sinister Diesel products.</Text>

<review>Quality parts, and great customer service. I purchased an oil bypass kit for my 6.0 about 2 years ago. I ended up blowing one of the lines to my oil fill cap and called that day to see if they could get me a new one. They stand behind their parts and overnighted me two lines instead of just the one that blew. That kind of customer service is not often found anymore and I can attest to that. I do not shop anywhere else for my diesel needs.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

I have a 2016 GMC Denali HD. I ordered the CAT fuel filter replacement kit. The screws did not have clearance from the engine to install the kit. I called the tech support and was just told that they’ve never heard of the screws not working. The follow up email was somewhat insulting saying there are two sets of screws. Use the one that works. Not impressed with their customer service at all.</review>

Bought the EGR delete for my F350. Super reasonably priced with very quick shipping. Very high quality and everything in the kit fit perfectly. Will definitely be buying more goodies from Sinister.<//review>

I appreciate the prompt delivery and completion of my order. I needed the specific piece right then and there. But I find it hard to believe that shipping costs 30-40$ on a 9$ part that you could fit in an envelope. The majority of the box was packaging material. I didnt even get a sticker in there...</Review>

Sinister had me to send a picture of the number inside the door, they told me I needed a modified grille, I ordered it and it fit perfectly. It arrived in time for Christmas and my hubby is happy as can be. Thanks guys you made his Christmas special.< /text>< pics>

Ordered sinister diesel 4” turbo back exhaust for my 2001 Ford F-250 7.3L! Package showed up 2 days after ordering before scheduled time! All parts where packaged nice and neat and in great shape! System installed in about 2 hour with no modification to anything all hanger fit into place as if factory! Started truck up and WOW! What a difference in sound. No need for straight pipe that comes with kit! Muffler has a nice low rumble at idle then wakes right up when you put your foot into it! Plus the really nice part not so loud it rattle your ear drums while cruising down freeway at 80 mph! All in all great experience with SINISTER DIESEL! Will be using them again and again got more items in shopping cart now it’s just trying to get wife onboard to spend the money bahahahahaha!<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><text>I have a very blue 6.0 Excursion thanks to Sinister Diesel! I have been impressed by all the parts I have. My latest purchase is a Bulldog Series 2 Turbo. I definitely feel a difference in my mid range power! It would have been nice to have some directions, but the install was straight forward enough.< /text>< pics>

<text>Excellent pricing, great products, easy to navigate site and fairly quick shipping given the current circumstances we are living in right now. When you need your truck to be on point with looks and functionality there's only one place I look to and thats sinisterdiesel.com. The only downfall I see is that there seems to be less choices for custom sinster diesel parts for LB7 Dmax</text>< pictures>

Love the look and the sound of the cold air intake on my LML. Sounds like a jet on a cold Michigan morning when warming up. Would have been 5 stars but dang. You spend that much $ and ya don’t even get a sticker in the box!</Review>

<Text>These Guy's are awesome to deal with , which includes Great Customer service , Fast shipping , and their parts are unbeatable in my opinion ,along with competitive if not the Best prices on the market . I'm not putting down Bullet proof Diesel products , but I think that those guys are over priced .That is why I give Sinister Diesel a 5 star rating , as I am a very satisfied customer . The only thing that I wish , is that they would send the buyer some Decals ( Sinister Diesel ) with your order , that's my only disappointment , ( I like Decals ) that show , and advertise who and what I am putting in my Truck . I would recommend these guys to an enemy , and that's saying ALOT . Thank You guys for your service and your performance parts that you offer . Sincerely Mr. Pat Paterson           Satisfied Customer and will be buying all of my parts from them .             A-1 in my BOOK .<//Text><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

Flawless job on the intake elbow. Not a terrible price considering the eBay knockoffs were almost the same price and no guarantee.</review>

I ordered an intercooler pipe for my 6.0 powerstroke and the original eta was 2 weeks out. I emailed them and told them I had to stay under 10 psi boost and they shipped it quicker because I needed it desperately.</Review>

<Review>Called after I placed an order to have the finish changed on a part I ordered. They were upfront about possible time delays due to the change and corrected the order right then and there for me. Item shipped out 2 days later and had no issues.<//Review>< username>

Bought the oil filter by-pass and coolant filter kit for my 6.0 Excursion, showed up 2 days later, everything needed was right in the box down to all the little clamps and zip-ties, bracket, filter housings, filter caps, fittings and lines all fit PERFECTLY, no trimming or “adjustments” needed, just ordered a 4” Stainless Steel turbo back exhaust system kit, will be a lifelong Sinister Diesel customer!< /review>

<Review>Every product i’ve got from sinister has been exact fit as oem, just as durable, and has far outlasted any of the other “just as oem” products. My orders have always been processed and shipped, even through the covid-19 pandemic, in a very timely manner. I’ve always had great responses with great help when asking questions about the product or simply what i need. Great company with great products, that will continue to have my business for the years to come.< /Review>< pictures>

Will not be ordering from Sinister again. Shipping time was slow, shipping price was ridiculously high, . Don't know if part will be good, had to buy one locally so I would have something to drive. Truck was down waiting for the part I ordered from Sinister.< /text>

Great company. From the user friendly website, high quality parts, constant offers, and points system for account holders. One of the best ways you know attention to detail is a must every box is labeled with who assembled and inspected the product. You can’t go wrong with Sinister Diesel.<//text>

I ordered an exhaust system from Sinister Diesel two weeks ago it was my first time ordering from them. After ordering I seen I had an issue so I thought, so I emailed them I got a quick response from them I was amazed at the customer service that I received. I was so impressed that within the same week I actually placed my second order with them a cold intake, I was gonna order it from somewhere else but because of the customer service I received it made me order from SD. Yup, my hubby is lucky he gets Father’s Day and our wedding Anniversary all in the same week! I will definitely be ordering again! I definitely give them ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</Text>

Best quality EGR Cooler, Oil Cooler, and Coolant Filter kit. My truck runs like new and Sinister Diesel helped me get exactly what I needed. Top notch customer service and the highest quality parts available.

Will only shop at Sinister Diesel for my parts for now on.< /text>

It's been a pleasure doing business…
It's been a pleasure doing business with sinister, Julien at sales was knowledgeable and respectful. He was willing to work with me in a pinch, got the part to me in a hurry. The affirm payment option for a seperate purchase was great option and I'm quite happy to have made that deal. I cant wait to get my new alternator and cold air intake installed! Thank you sinister for being awesome!</Text>

<Text>I had to replace Intercooler pipes, and I am by no means a mechanic. Sinister had great reviews so I ordered new pipes. They had videos to help me, not that it is a hard project but it helped. I had also called to ask questions about other upgrades, my experience was great from how quickly the parts shipped to the customer service over the phone to the quality and look. I will definitely continue to do business with sinister diesel.< /Text>< Date>

Knowing I have piece of mind that my coolant would clean not prevent any clog on the oil cooler. This is a must have. Planning on installing one on my 6.8V10..

Ordered multiple parts from Sinister Diesel for my truck. Everything is always on time and their customer service is always helpful and willing to answer any and all questions, no matter how many. Never have to worry whether or not all the parts will be there when it arrives. Only downside is the pricing, some stuff seems a bit overpriced, like you’re paying for the name sometimes (especially on smaller items). As for the big stuff, the pricing is fair and the quality of the parts will never disappoint. I will be ordering from Sinister for as long as I have a diesel!<//review>

I ordered a part for my husband for Father's Day. It wasn't until after I placed the order that I realized I added something on he didn't need. I emailed them immediately and they fixed it for me quickly and with no hassle. It arrived on time and the hubby was happy with the quality.</review>

Ordered a Cold Air Intake for my 6.7 Powerstroke.
Shipping was fast and the CAI was in perfect condition.  Can’t wait to add more Sinister Diesel parts to my truck in the future.<//review>

Sinister Diesel is my go to spot for everything for my 2007.5 dodge ram 2500 cummins.  They always have what i am looking for in stock and an amazing look as well to dress up your engine bay.< /Text>

<text>The parts I received for my 2004 Ford Excursion 4X4 6.0L were good quality parts and they shipped the order pretty quick! I’m not sure about dealing customer service on the phone I’ve never called them but I have emailed them one time and I received a quick reply within 24 hours. I’m a very happy customer and I would do business with them again!</text>< pics>

<review>Bought the intercooler pipe kit with boots and intake elbow for 04 6.0 Powerstroke and couldn’t be more pleased. One of my CAC boots ripped only allowing me to build 14lbs of boost. After putting this kit on I am back up to 28-30lbs of boost and it looks awesome too! Also, I had to call customer service for an issue I was having and they were extremely knowledgeable and nice. I will definitely be buying more from them in the future! Thanks guys!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I recently purchased an EGR delete kit with the high flow elbow and a charge hard and cold side pipe kit. The quality of these products are outstanding. The instructions are super detailed and they provided great customer service. I will definitely shop here again!< /Text>

Have A lot of blue Sinister under the hood of my 05 f250 6.0, just passed 241,xxx with stock heads/ studs and I can only think the preventative measures I’ve added to ensure a reliable, faster, and cooler looking motor have helped keep my 6.0 on the road and truckin! Thanks for the quality products!</Text>

It was very easy to install and came through with quality you can depend on. As soon as I started my truck I noticed the difference in idle quality and power.

Purchased injectors, a lift pump and a sump kit for my 01 dodge 2500. Everything came on time and showed up in good condition.  Didnt receive a tracking number for the injectors because they shipped straight from dynamite diesel. But sinister sent me tracking info with no issues. Will consider them in my future diesel parts purchases.< /review>

I was very happy with the product it looked good and worked good. the only complaint I had was with the style of cover that came with the regulator was shaped differently from my stock cover and they should have an option for an extension on your fuel pressure sensor because of this I had to get an adapter at the local auto parts store but all in all everything turned out good.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Just installed the Sinister Diesel Coolant Filtration System on my 2003 Dodge 3500. Great package with everything I needed for the installation. Instructions, packaging and parts are all professionally done. Would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to run a coolant filtration system on their vehicle. I also ordered 2 extra filters so I can do the recommend initial filter changes for the system. Lastly, working with Sinister Diesel to get a bypass oil filter system for the 2003-04 5.9l dodge. They have helped me out and hopefully keep coming out with more products.< /Review>

I bought their exhaust system for my lbz. Good price, easy to install. Shipping was free and got a discount code so couldn't beat it. Only thing I can knock is the instructions were kinda lacking. Just a detailed pic of where each pipe and hanger goes would be nice. Luckily there are videos on YouTube installing this exhaust so not too hard to figure it out. Oh and you think they would include one sticker, but nah. Oh well.<//review>

<username>JT III%< /username><date>1555608221635< /date><Rating>1< /Rating><review>First and last time I will ever deal with sinister diesel. I called to get information on parts I was wanting to order was told they were in stock and would ship out . 3 days later I called back because parts had not shipped I was told oh parts with people that do are powder coating it should ship Monday which is  5 days away. So they did upgrade me to second delivery. Now Wednesday still no email confirmation of order being shipped so I called back again. I was told this time  they did not have the part it was back ordered and would be at least a week or two before it shipped. At this point I asked for a full refund and was told the refund would be issued that day.  I called back 3 days later just to make sure refund had been done not seeing anything with the bank. I was told no the refund had not been done yet , I was then told they would issue refund that day again.  5 hrs later I get an email confirmation of refund and two days later today I finally have my refund.  I see sinister as a joke. If you don’t have the parts just say so up front don’t lie to your customers and play games.
I went to Banks ordered my parts no problems and had them two days ago .</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>Recently ordered new up pipes and a down pipe for my 6.4 powerstroke which is my main work truck. Had a short window to do the work and i give kudos to Sinister Diesel  for making it happen. Being a pipefitter/rig welder type person for over 30 yrs other people's work gets picked at pretty hard and i have to say it was beautiful work and couldn't ask for a better fit on the flanges. Great job y'all and Thank you<//text>< pics>

I recently picked up a powerstroke. Sinister deseil has a lot of popularity in powerstroke searches. I started to look at their products yes prices are high but look at the quality. The welds are beautiful the material is top notch. That blue isn't to bad either lol. I decided to go with a blue spring upgrade with their billet housing. So during installation one of my threads stripped on my powerstroke. The housing is so well built  by sinister diesel it doesn't leak and or matter. I plan to get it fixed but its a oat to quality. However decide for yourself.<//text>

Have ordered twice from Sinister. Products arrive in a reasonable amount of time and items were well packaged. I had an issue with a small piece out of my blue spring kit. Customer service took care of me without hassle and sent a replacement quickly. I think the products look great and I have had nothing but positive experience with customer service. Would recommend to friends.</review>

Purchased the oil filtration for my Ford 6.0. I was adding it to my existing coolant filter and the new kit came with a bracket to accept both.
Kit is well made and was easy to install and looks great under the hood!< /text>

Got the blue spring kit with billet non adjustable block for my 6.0 Powerstroke. It made and unbelievable difference in throttle response and cleared up the little puff of smoke I would get on takeoff from a stop.<//Review>

Every time I need something for my 6.0 I always turn to Sinister first. I have almost every product available from turbo to caps and EVERY part is awesome. the craftsmanship is over the top. I see alot of people on pages bashing Sinister due to a bad experience and price. Well cheaper is usually never better and every manufacturer out there has bad apples. You pay for what you get and here you get quality!!!</Text>

<Text>Great fast customer service. I ordered an intake and a shirt. They forgot to send the shirt and that day they sent one out immediately with some free goodies inside. I don’t rate a company on their mistakes but I rate them on how they correct them. So I give them a 5star rating.<//Text>< Pics>

Poor online explanation of items added with your purchase, such as the ultra torque lube, they state "do you want to add ultra torque to your order for $9.99" i said yes, but when it showed up it was just a little 1oz tube not the 10oz bottle I expected like other performance part companies add, when you buy a arp head stud kit don't waist $9.99 for something that comes included already with every arp head stud kit.  What a rip off! Never going thru sinister again and stay away from the blue devil!  But hey they send ya another 1oz bottle. What a joke!</Review>

I have ordered several parts for my 7.3 excursion from sinister diesel and the quality of parts has been outstanding. Their customer service is excellent and they have helped me find the correct parts for my needs. I am for sure a sinister fan and nice to see there are still companies with quality products!!!< /Text>

<review>I bought a Redhead steering gear for my 2008 Ram 2500 had it installed and love it. A little tight but expected it I know it will loosen in time. Sent the core back to Redhead, and hoping I get the core charge back as fast as they shipped it to me.</review>< rating>

The parts I received were exactly what I ordered and delivered on time.  I would only ask that the instructions were a little more detailed in where certain hangers went on the exhaust system.  With that I will definitely buy from them again!!!</Text>

Fast shipping the part arrived on time was exactly what I needed.
I had to call in to sinister to confirm fitment, process was quick and easy and they were very informative.</Review>

<review>When another vendor who sells Sinisters parts, took my money and ran. I reached out to one of the sales reps Eric. Eric went well and beyond what customer service, he set bar. And had my parts out the next day. You've certainly  got a happy customer for life!! 🤘<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Pretty easy to find what you need on the site. I had an issue with the heads up kit I ordered because the head studs that came with it were supposedly on back order. I called them to rectify it, took a couple phone tags but we got it done, and they quickly and efficiently got what I needed on the way and without any pain so cudoes to sinister diesel.

Recently bought the NEW Pitbull series turbo for my lbz duramax easy drop in install, turbo sounds good but as far as the HUGE BOOST gains it says it has..... MY STOCK turbo put out 2lbs of boost more than this upgraded turbo... noise from the pitbull turbo is nice it sounds good but as far as boost... save your money.<//Review>

I purchased an exhaust system for my 2001 F350 crew cab long bed. The ad said it would fit any configuration truck up to 172 inch wheelbase and was a direct bolt in. For some reason the system is about 6 inch too short so I had to cut a chunk from the muffler delete pipe. only one of the hangars matched up with my Factory exhaust hanger points. The directions are mediocre-at-best telling you how to install it. For some who may have installed systems before it might be better. I was very disappointed that I still had to have professional work done to complete the system. I also think it would be nice if they would offer an exhaust system for trucks with a lift on it due to the fact that the piece that goes over the rear axle would not need to be bent at all. Quality of the product was decent for the price the welds did not look too bad but the clamps are pretty cheap. It's possible on the more expensive kits may be everything would have been better.< /Review>

I made the mistake of purchasing a different aftermarket adapter for my Duramax. The plan was to attach a CAT high efficiency fuel filter. Well, the adapter threads were wrong. So, I decided to order it from Sinister Diesel. When I received it, I compared it to the other adapter. Sinister Diesel has a great product! It’s large and very durable. It was very easy to install and looks great!! Thank you all for a great product!! His is my second purchase from you all. Both products are fantastic!!

Ordered the coolant filtration system and blue doing upgrade for my 6.0. Shipping took a little bit but it was worth the wait. Installed the spring upgrade and was simple! Looks great too. I have yet to install the coolant filter but will follow up with pics when I do.<//Review>

I have purchased the Blue Spring Kit & the Coolant Bypass System for my Ford. Ordering was easy. The coolant system arrived as promised, easy to understand directions. The Blue Spring became back ordered 10 days. I received an email informing me of the delay.

When I called customer service, Sean was very apologetic. He offered to help locate a shop that had it, if I needed before their delivery date.

The equipment was high quality machined & everything fit perfectly! The Blue Kit delivers the added fuel psi & the throttle response is great! The coolant system is also high quality parts & gives me the confidence that the Wix filter is keeping my engine free of contaminates.

I have friends who have purchased other items with great outcomes as well! Superb quality parts & great customer service equals a happy customer!<//Text>

Great company providing great products. I ordered a part and chose overnight shipping only to get a phone call from their office to tell me they are in the same town as I am. I picked up my part locally and was refunded my shipping costs. I will buy from them again!!< /Review>

They said it couldn't be done

Actually putting the Sinister oil bypass kit on a ram 6.7 with dual radiators it's pretty simple. All it took was putting a shim under the third bolt position and tipping the filter down far enough so that it didn't distort the hoses going to the radiator it works fine but it would be a lot better if they add two or three inches to the discharge line because I could have tipped it more and still had room to get the canister on from the bottom except I was starting to stretch the discharge line like a guitar string so I had to tip it back up thus somewhat distorting the radiator hoses.

I didn't really care what it was going to take to put the kit in ... it was going to go in because I don't really want to run soot though my bearings and as it turned out it was very simple to do .

So hopefully they'll figure out that all they have to do is lower the point of contact with the hoses and extend the discharge line to make it just as easy to put on a dual radiator system as a standard radiator system</review>

I've only purchased an intake bridge pipe and a t shirt but extremely satisfied with fit and finish. Really dresses up under the hood looks great. T- shirt was nice too.</text>

We were very happy that Sinister Diesel had a 4-6 inch drop pitman arm. Not many companies had this in stock. My husband builds custom trucks and Sinister will be our go-to from here on out. We would like to see faster shipping, but all in all very good quality and easy to use website!</review>

I've purchased the sinister coolant filtration system with oil filter bypass, blue spring kit with adjustable fuel pressure, billet fuel filter cap for running a fuel pressure guage, and a blue spring kit and thermostat housing for my brother. All for 6.0s. The quality of the parts and the speed at which we received them have been absolutely top notch. The fit is perfect, the finish is flawless, and the instructions that come with it are great. I will continue to use Sinister as I work my way through the bulletproofing process on my truck.<//Text>

<Review>I have bought multiple items from sinister, egr delete, oil cooler, gasket kit, coolant filtration, 4” exhaust, new grill, all were delivered quickly, only had one problem with the oil cooler which was next day flown to me and installed. Great Customer service system, lady sounded hot on the phone dunno maybe she was. I’ll keep ordering for sure.</Review>< userid>

Sinister diesel has very high-quality products at a competitive price!
I purchased a coolant reservoir aluminum cap for my 1999 7.3 L Ford super duty. It looks great and has worked flawlessly.
Keep the innovation coming!</Text>

<text>Sinister diesel service...I have been a diesel owner for years and ordered hundreds of parts from companies. I recently purchased the HSP Y bridge from sinister. There prices are great but there customer service is outstanding. I never waited to speak with a representative they were always polite, professional and knew about the product they sold. Best diesel company out there and will definitely use sinister in the future</text>< Pictures>

I ordered a fuel pressure regulator through sinister diesel. The product works great and really helped with the trucks performance. Delivery was fast and very well packaged with installer friendly instruction.<//review>

After installing 3 rebuilt alternators, best one lasted 5 months. I ordered a 200 amp from Sinister Diesel and was pleasantly surprised .  Quality product;  Great looks;  Solid 14 volt output.  Time will tell.</review>

I purchased an SCT live wire, AFE intake and blue spring fuel upgrade kit for my 6.0 and I couldn’t be happier. The day after the parts were installed, I drove to the truck for 12 hours in 2 days and towed 10k pounds for 4 of it and everything performed flawlessly!< /review>

I ordered parts for my 6.7 liter Cummings an received the parts in a timely manner.  When I called about a missing Banks Intake System they were able to track it down to the manufacturer.  Good communication skills and customer service.</Review>

<Review>The best aftermarket company to deal with for all your Duramax & Powerstroke needs. Only saying these two because I own both platforms and have been using Sinister for a while now. They have me as a repeat customer for life. Friendly employees to deal with, reasonable prices and decent shipping.< /Review>< pictures>

Sinister Diesel is top shelf for sure. They even sent the exact star but to take off the electrical and the stainless nuts for the cold air intake. I emailed them and got a phone call in less than 5 minutes. Will continue to order from them as long as I own a diesel.<//review>

Ordered the Cat fuel filter adapter kit for duramax, only dislike is the removal of the water in fuel sensor, other than that the product was clean, had a made and inspected by card, and has worked very well thus far. Product will pay for itself in the long run. Better filter for 45 dollars cheaper and the adapter looks great</review>

Easy website to navigate. Reasonable prices. Fast shipping.  Both my sons use Sinister for their 6.0 parts. I used it for the first time for my 6.7. I will definitely use Sinister again for sure! We all have nothing but good to say about this company!</Text>

Great parts. Blew a coolant line so decided to snag a egr delete kit and my truck can finally breathe. Just hope the law Doesn’t want to take a look cause the blue aftermarket parts might give me away< /text>

< Review>
Top notch diesel performance parts and accessories! The quality of parts we’ve purchased and installed have greatly exceeded my expectation! Wow!
Scott Maranda in sales has taken care of us, making sure the correct parts are ordered for my Excursion! Yet again Sinister exceeded my expectations of what customer service should be!

Great product. I ordered the cold air intake for my 6.7 powerstroke. Really happy with the results and the way it fits. Quality parts, clamps, boots. However, reason for being a 4 and not a 5 is this, mine shipped about a week after I ordered it and when I received it, there were no instructions for installation anywhere. Luckily, I know what I’m doing a bit but there was nothing to reference at all. Other than that, I’m really happy with it.< /review>

Shipping time was pretty fast for vehicle parts(4 business days). Parts were of great quality for my 6.4 work truck. Fixed a broken part, cost 5$ more than the OEM replacement piece and looks better too. The instruction needed a tiny bit more detail but anyone who is slightly mechanically inclined should be able to figure it out.< /review>

<Text>I have purchased a number of items from Sinister Diesel. The most major purchase I made was a complete solutions package for my 07 6.0 Powerstroke. To be honest, I was a little apprehensive to take this route rather than OEM, but in hindsight I couldn’t be any more pleased. All the parts were of great quality and they have held up great. About a year after replacing the head gaskets and other major parts included with the kit, I had a small problem with the o-ring seals on one standpipe. I contacted Sinister Diesel and their customer service took the care to replace the parts as quickly as they were able. The parts are great, the customer service is great, and the knowledge that these parts are made right in here the USA all help me to feel that I will go through Sinister Diesel for all of my truck’s needs. I couldn’t be any more pleased with the experiences I have had with them so far. They are a little more expensive compared to the knockoff items other companies offer, but in my opinion, it is well worth the extra money.</Text></record></dataset><record>

The sell great products at a fair price. I have bought items that are cheaper, from elsewhere. I can honestly say “You get what you pay for.” Sinister Diesel sells more expensive products but they fit like an OEM replacement. Will definitely be buying more from them in the future.</review>

Ordered the blue spring upgrade, my truck was leaking fuel pretty bad. I love the way this looks! It’s my first mod, so kinda like a first tattoo. My truck just got it’s first tattoo. Looking forward to more Sinister products! And what’s even better, Sinister is American made! Love that blue!< /Text>

Sinister Diesel provided me with a LLY Race EGR full Delete. It was a quality product at a fair price. The instructions were very easy to follow too. They also included everything I needed for the job and what tools to use also before I tore into and found out I needed something special. The pipe had a slight fitment issue but was easily bent into place and tightened down. They also powder coated the piece Sinister blue so it didn’t only work good but looked good which I find equally important.

I would personally recommend my friends to buy Sinister products the four out of five stars was due to fitment and that it is hard to extremely please me.</text>

I purchased the caterpillar fuel filter adapter from sinister diesel, and I am completely satisfied. The craftsmanship and quality maching of the product exceeded my expectations %100! I am pleased with my purchase and would definitely recommend. Thanks again guys.... A+++</Review><username>Aj Shelton<//username>< user>

Do not use the web chat/email service.  They will not respond to that.  You will need to call, wait up to 10 minutes for a live helpful response to your questions.  If you need mike from the fab shop, wait another 10 minutes after the initial wait.  Have your cell phone fully charged.

All but one of my orders had fast delivery and quality parts.  Either made by sinister diesel or by others.

My only concern is of the weld integrity of their headers.  However, I was reassured after sending pictures and another phone call, that there have been no header cracking or other failures.  That these were full penetration welds and that they have a life time warranty.  We may find out more with this product.  I do not have that comfy feeling on the header quality.  The lack of fillet welds worries me.

Otherwise, no issues yet.  Thanks for the help guys<//text>

I purchased a bypass oil filter kit for a 2018 Ram 2500 6.7 Cummins.  Parts seem to be very high quality and the kit installed fairly easily in a couple of hours.  The instructions came with color photos.  When they say “you may” have to move a coolant line to instal the oil line on top of the oil filter .... you do.  So I wouldn’t remove the NPT plug on top of the oil filter housing until all of that coolant drains out.  I also modified the factory bracket that they said needed to be removed for the upper radiator hose so that it could still be used.  All in all I’m impressed with the quality. I did an oil analysis before installation so time will tell in a year when I do another one what the results will be.</text>

I like the products, but the sales team could use some work. Not very knowledgeable. I asked about a military discount. They told me they did do one , but had no idea how to apply it. So I received no discount. But like I said good product.<//review>

The only problem I had ordering was waiting on hold for so long, but once I got through to a sales person, the order process went quickly and smoothly.  My order didn't ship out right away, but when it did I received it in the 3 days it was promised.  I do believe that yes the customer service could use some improvement, but seems to me they must be doing a good business if you have to wait so long on the phone to talk to someone.</text>

I've ordered from these guys a few times, but it's been a few years since my last purchase. I came back to sinister because their customer service, prices, and response times were always good in the past. This time was no different, and I'll continue to use sinister in the future. The quality, fit, and finish are always excellent on their brand parts.< /Text>

Nothing else was done by the previous owner. So I got their kit for the egr delete, oil cooler update, and the coolant relocation. I haven’t installed them yet but they got here in good time, price seems fair for eliminating the issues this motor has.</review><username>King Douglas<//username>< Pictures>

I bought a cold air intake for my 1999 f250 7.3 power stroke looks beautiful under the hood not only were there online videos for the install they sent a nice step by step guide. So for the people who don’t know how to install it.</Review>

I purchased a coolant filter kit for my 2005 f-350 and love it the kit looks good goes together easily and I have had no issues with it since installing took longer then expected to finally arrive but once here had it on in about 30 mins I will be looking for more parts from them in the future< /Text>

< Review>
I've purchased several products from Sinister.  On my last order there were some issues that required me to return some products.  Their customer service was outstanding.  They communicate very well in a professional manner and ensured my issue was resolved to my satisfaction.  I will definitely be back.< /Review>

My only suggestion to them is to offer more items in a black or grey. I don't like to be flashy, so the blue is a little much for me.<//Text><gmapID>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8< /gmapID><user_id>105704624122210809968</user_id><Name>Nick Larson</Name>< time>

I purchased the Sinister Diesel Blue Spring Kit with Billet Spring Housing for my  2007 Ford F 250 6.0  Powerstroke.
Quality product at a fair price. Installation was easy and didn't take long at all. This was my first Sinister Diesel purchase for Prohect Plain Jane.  I can guarantee you it won't be my last. Thanks Sinister for the great product and awesome customer service!< /Text>

I don’t think you can beat the price or the quality of this product. They sent an excellent trouble-shooting guide to ensure that the problem is getting fixed and the core return was easy.

Purchased a 5" turbo back ss exhaust for my '05 Cummins. Price was excellent, plus 10% additional off for purchasing on weekend! Part was not in stock but sinister diesel worked with me. Great service! Will follow up when I get exhaust.</Review>

<review>Very efficient with getting the part delivered. The part discription and specific to my truck was on point. The ficm was plug and play no programming needed. Returning the core was a little confusing had to call customer service and have them send me a link to the UPS return link should be mailed in the box with the item if a core charge is applied to the order. I will use sinister from now on for all diesel parts.<//review>< Pics>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I have ordered from Sinister twice. Both times, no problems. Both were web orders, and both shipped quickly (items delivered inside of a week, but I am in CA.). I've never dealt with anyone in person, or on the phone. Maybe they are jerks in person, but I would never know. They've had what I needed, so I'll continue to be a customer until there's a reason not to be.
Being in the retail business myself, I see a lot of these 1 star reviews among a sea 5 star reviews and there is always more to the story than the complainer let's on. Usually the customer is just a pain in the a$$ and will never be happy. Many times the customer is just flat out wrong, but the internet has given every whiner a voice, so there you go. Frequently it is actually the distributor or manufacturer that is the reason parts are delayed. No company is perfect, and sometimes problems occur. That doesn't mean a company is bad or dishonest. You'll just have to give them a shot and find out for yourself. I'm happy with them, if that makes any difference.</Text>< Pics>

I purchased a Fuel Filter Cap for my 6.0l Excursion.  Part came in Quick, it was well packaged, look and feel are excellent, and works perfectly.  I am really glad that I chose to go with this metal cap vs. getting another plastic cap.  Thanks for everything.< /review>

<Review>The parts work great performance wise,definitely woke my 7.3 up, and very freindly customer service. The only complaints I have is that 1. they had to send my kit separatly parts because they didn’t have them in stock (I’m still waiting on an exhaust ) but they did contact me informing me they would have to do so. 2. Is that  it almost seems like they sent the wrong support for my air intake because it’s about 5 inches shorter than it would need to be to mount to the truck. So this left me having to make a support bracket for the part but after this it worked perfectly.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I ordered an IDM from Sinister. It arrived promptly and looks really nice. I thought I had an issue with the IDM being the wrong one. I contacted Sinister and they went over every part of the order and I was assured it was correct. Installed the next day and worked perfectly like they assured me it would!! Great service and parts.</review>

<review>Ordered for the first time from sinister. The parts I ordered were on back order, they informed me right away. They gave me the option to cancel order, or wait. I chose to wait. They contacted me as soon as the parts shipped and gave me an estimated arrival date. Will be ordering from them more often!

I love you Sinister Diesel I've been using them for almost 10 years and their products are far more superior they've put a lot of effort into it especially if your own power strokes they are one of the best or use their parts on my personal trucks and on my work trucks I own a construction company and have a quite a few vehicles and they're blue which for me is awesome my favorite part about them is probably their customer service more in reference to the technical support side and troubleshooting they have no problem talking to you all day long if you need some help working on something I love Sinister Diesel.</text>

By far the best quality parts on the market. So far i have purchased the Blue Spring kit with Plate, EGR delete, Oil bypass kit, Sinister badging kit, and most recently purchase of the coolant filter kit. All the Sinister products are made to perfection and you can tell are over engineered for long term life and attention to detail in even the packaging of their products.

Every time i call i get a person i can talk to and a friendly voice, and was even offered a military discount once they found out i was a Marine.

GREAT JOB SINISTER TEAM!! Almost done with my Excursion and will be sending you guys pictures!!<//text>

< Review>
Great experience with Sinister Diesel!
I ordered a an AMSOIL By-Pass filter kit for my 2006 Dodge Ram 3500 5.9L Cummins. My oil is as clean as ever. Have not conducted an Oil Analysis yet but plan to soon. This kit is amazing and looks real good under the hood. Only point of concern I had was the vibration and what effects it will eventually have on the filter but, the bracket is welded with quality!
When I did initially received the order it did heave the wrong filter head. It had the coolant filter head instead. I called Sinister Diesel up told them the issue and they mailed the right filter head overnight!
Thank you Sinister diesel!</Review>

They had the part I needed for $15 cheaper than my Ford dealer could get it for. The part came quick and one YouTube video and an hour later the part was installed without a hitch. I think I saved myself about $300 installing the part myself.  I only wish I had the bucks to purchase some of the cool items for my truck.  I would recommend them to anyone.< /Review>

<Review>I have dealt with this company many times and will continue to do business with them in the future. Everything I have purchased from them not only looked great but it fit exactly the way it was described. The bypass coolant and oil kit I purchased from them looks great and does a great job. Needless to say I recommend them to any body looking for diesel pick up parts.< /Review>< user_id>

2000 Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel, needed a new clutch master/slave cylinder. Sinister Diesel had the South Bend HD set up for a good price. Ordered it and received it no problems. Quick and fairly painless installation. Clutch pedal and shifting feels much better now.</Text>

I was very pleased with how easy it is to navigate on the website & I am very pleased with the parts that purchased from sinister diesel but...... I am very disappointed with the fact that I spent over $1000 & didn't even receive a sticker for my truck. $1000 dollars is worth a hat, t-shirt, and sticker in my opinion. How can you advertise for a company without any advertisements?<//text>

<Review>Bought the Sinister headers for my 6.0 diesel. Was told it would be a delay due to the fact they are made to order. Customer service kept me posted by email on its progress. Even sent me a complimentary t-shirt when I inquired about order. Customer service stays on top and is very friendly and professional in handling inquiries. Will definitely do business with again.< /Review><Response>None<//Response>< pictures>

I can't really complain about Sinister Diesel. Their tech support helped get my first gen Cummins back on the road and running better than ever. Shipping was an issue and that I mean my truck was down an extra week but it all worked out. I plan on doing future business with them to keep my first gen happy and their great support<//Text>

< Review>
I bought several parts from sinister diesel. They have always fit and looked great. If I do have a problem the service department is on it. The one problem I had was the adjustable blue spring kit. It didn’t come preset to the pressure it was supposed to be set at. It was very high. I’m glad I had a gauge installed or I could have ruined my injectors. I called the service department and they guided me on how to adjust it properly.<//Review>

I ordered an injection pump for my Duramax after mine went up. I ordered a pump they said they had in stock online and paid extra for overnight shipping. They not only didn’t notify me that the pump I ordered was not actually in stock, but also had the nerve to charge me the extra 55 dollars for a pump they did have in stock, 3 days after I was supposed to receive the first pump. They also stated that they would refund my initial shipping cost since I didn’t get a pump for about a week after the initial order, but that never happened. I also had to get a shipping label sent from them for the core return because they were going to make me pay shipping to send the core back! And I inquired about the shipping cost being refunded to me in the same email chain and have yet to here back from them after 5 days. I will never recommend them or buy from them again. Very disappointed in the customer service, system, and just general business practice. I’m convinced the only reason the pump wasn’t junk is because they didn’t make it!</text>

<text>I ordered my egr delete and air intake from sinister. The intake was back ordered so we emailed them and they instantly replied and told us when it would be shipped and arrival date. They produce great products and have good customer service. They also send free sinister stickers and sometimes shirts with orders which is nice.<//text><rate>5</rate><username>Eric Odum< /username></record></dataset><record>

Great company and great productsI have ordered through Sinister Diesel four times in the past and recently ordered a new air filter and charge pipe kit. I have not installed yet but the kit looks great. Can't wait to get it on. Great service, shipping was good, and customer service was excellent. Everything comes to my door quickly and everything arrived undamaged. Thank you, will be a repeat customer.

In the picture, there were packing peanuts in the box when the charge pipe kit was shipped. When they arrived I took them out.< /Review>

Ordered a Red Head steering gear for my 2001 Dodge 2500, 5.9 Cummins from Sinister Diesel, process was easy, steering gear arrived when and as stated. I had my mechanic install steering gear, pack up core and I shipped it back to Red Head. I received my core refund in two days and was extremely pleased with the ease of doing business with Sinister Diesel. I would certainly recommend them for anyone needing parts for their diesel truck..<//review>

I  searched the Web and found looking for some parts and found Sinister Diesel.  They had the type of locks I wanted for my truck hitches,  and for the best price.  Not only was their price the lowest, but in addition, Sinister provided me with a a $10 off coupon  as a first time purchaser!  The locks came quickly and they were packed well and in perfect shape.  I have already recommended Sinister to my friends and I will definitely order from Sinister again.  It was a very good experience.< /review>

<Text>I,have used Sinister Diesel on several different occasions to purchase parts to upgrade my 05 Powerstroke and i have been extremely happy with their service, parts have arrived quickly and without damage.  They have a wide selection of parts and kits to get the job done. And the one time that i did need to return some items it was hassle free.
I,would highly recommend Sinister Diesel, and i will continue to use them as i continue to  keep my truck on the road for many years to come.</Text>< Pictures>

Despite having delays with two orders, I stand
By 5 stars for SD and Aaron in ordering.  I received a wrong alternator, but Aaron researched it and got me the correct part.  Second issue was with the SD motor mounts for the duramax.  The mounts arrived timely but two fastening nuts for the mount bushings were missing.  Again, I turned to Aaron and the missing parts were over nighted so that the project could be completed.

Thx SD!!</text>

Sinister is not a innovative company at all. Most of what they sell is ripped off from Other companies and made in China. Poor quality and horrible consistency in parts.

Not to mention they ise fear tactics and lies to attempt to bully anyone they see as a threat.

I wouldn’t recommend doing business with this sorry excuse of a company.<//Text>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>I ordered the coolant filter and secondary oil filter kit from sinister. I couldn't be happier. Easy install and when I called with questions they were there to help. I have already recommend them to many other diesel owners who have also ordered from them. I will be back for future business for sure.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

The steering damper for my Ram 2500 was a good fit and easy install. Can't vouch for the customer service as others are complaining about because they got my order right and I didn't need to call them. That alone says I'll come back again.< /Review>< pictures>

Very fast shipping, the stuff I ordered was built way better than I expected at a reasonable price. One of the t-shirts I ordered was out of stock in my size so they threw in some cool stuff and an extra shirt for my wife,,and an actual hand written note which you don't get now days. Great company, great people!! Hope I don't need any parts lol but if I do they have my business<//text>

We've used sinister for my wife's Ford 6.0 power stroke, the sales reps have always been very helpful and have gone way beyond to make sure we have the right parts fast and at a great price.  There office staff is great also, we've dropped in to the office with our three boys, ages 8-10 and they are always giving them something cool, top notch customer service and we are very happy with the quality.</review>

<Text>Worst first experience ever!! Bought a $650 hpop (reman) which turned to be defective. Company warrantied the part but I got stuck paying an additional $850 because their warranty didn't cover any labor. Turned me off completely when I had heard so much good about this company.  Won't use again.< /Text>< pics>

After having replaced 3 plastic degas bottles in 190k miles it was time to go to a Sinister Aluminum Powdercoated Degas bottle with a Billet Aluminum Radiator cap!  For the first time in 190k miles the Degas bottle is not puking out Antifreeze! I am so happy to have solved this issue!</review>

Bought some parts for my 97 f350 from these guys. Not only was the shipping fast and the parts worked exactly as they were listed to, but the technical support was over the top. Had a problem installing a harness and one of the techs walked me through the install step by step. Would recommend Sinister to anyone!</Review>

<Review>Ordered a part that did not work as described and was incomplete to allow for normal operation of the vehicle after install. Even after chatting with two "technical advisers" before ordering to ensure the part wouldn't cause a CEL it was obvious these two had no idea what they were talking about despite their assurances to me. Took them a month to respond to numerous calls and emails about the issue and even now more than FIVE WEEKS after the original email they still haven't answered the question as to whether or not I can return it. Garbage product, garbage customer service. Do yourself a favor and order elsewhere, this company is useless from start to finish.</Review>< pictures>

I frequently purchase products from Sinister Diesel not only because of the quality of merchandise they produce & sell, but also because their stuff makes my truck perfom better and looks great when I pop the hood on my Duramax!

I keep my engine blue all day, everyday the Sinister way!

I have a 2006 f250 super duty.  when I got ready to purchase a cold air intake for my truck, I looked around at different brands.  when it was all said and done, sinister was my favorite. I got one, and I'm very happy.  the tech support is great.  I plan on buying their stage 2 turbo soon.  great products.< /review>

<review>I have ordered multiple items from Sinister Diesel and always had a good experience.  The last item that I purchased from them was their brand 4" exhaust for my 6.0 L Powerstroke.  I had my brother help me put it on and he was skeptical since it was after market.  We were both impressed with the quality and how well it fit.  I would not hesitate buying more from Sinister Diesel in the future.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8</gmapID></record>

<Text>I bought Sinister Diesels coolant filter kit. It installed correctly for my 2004 Ford F250 6.0. I've had it for approximately one month now and am about to change the first filter. Hopefully it's doing its job, I expect to see quite a bit of debris unfortunately. I'll try and repost, or update my post after my findings!< /Text>< Pics>

I ordered an EGR delete kit for my 2006 Duramax and could not be happier with the install.  The kit came with everything I needed for the install.  The quality of the part is second to none, love the color and the sinister decal on the piping, it adds to the look of the engine bay.  I am 100% satisfied with the customer service I received from Sinister Diesel, receiving email notifications when the part shipped as well as emails asking if I received everything I ordered on-time and undamaged.  Great Company to deal with, will order again from Sinister Diesel.< /text>

Bought a 2003 f250 Superduty and my mechanic purchased everything I would need from sinister diesel to fully bullet proof my 6.0. It's been about two years now and havnt had any issues what's so ever. Ordered some sinister diesel apparel for a couple of christmas gifts this year. Had a little trouble with my order when it arrived. Emailed them that day and got a response that very day. Costumer service was great. Thank you. Looking forward to doing business with sinister diesel again.<//review>

<Review>Very fast and very affordable. Sinister had exactly what I needed for replacing the head gaskets on my 05 LLY. The kit with the ARP head studs was the best-priced one around and I saved literally hundreds of dollars. Fantastic company and I will continue to do business with them.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>I've been trying to get ahold of someone for over a week to order a $5,000 BD transmission and torque converter. I don't know why I keep trying with this company. Today the receptionist told me that if I desire faster service, call someone else. Will do, thank you for the advice!<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
Order a $1000.00 Hpop and they don't send the Hpop cover gasket?  WOW.  I also tried to order an exhaust that I was told on the phone would ship in a day or two only to get an email 3 days later that it was back ordered for 8 to 10 weeks.  Spent a lot of money and wish I would have taken my money else where.  I would recommend using a local shop to order parts not these guys.  HORRIBLE if ask me....</Review>

I have nothing but great things to say about Sinister Diesel! I was in the middle of doing the 6.0 bulletproof and received a part that got damaged during shipping. Called Sinister and they overnighted a new oil cooler and threw in a free hat and some stickers! Best customer service and support I have ever worked with.</Text>

2007 F350 4X4 had installed 50hp boost on injectors and 100hp on FICM. I then was not breathing enough so installed SINISTER intake all pipes and a stainless racing exhaust 5" from turbo back. She runs like a banshee Indian on fire. My exhaust has muffler so much quieter than most (wife likes dat). I love all that blue under the hood. Told my wife I may take the hood off, LOL. It's lots of fun to drive.</review>

< Review>
I had a major melt down with my12 year old 2005 6.0 Power Stroke Diesel Excursion. Oil Cooler ruptured internally and pumped 4 quarts of oil into my radiator. I went to the Web site for Sinister Diesel and did some initial research and then contacted Eric by Phone. He was most helpful and I ordered a package deal. It had an updated Oil Cooler, new design EGR Cooler, upgraded Stand Pipes, Dummy Plugs, HPOP update kit, upgraded Turbo Oil Feed Line, Drain Tube, Blue Spring kit, Bypass Oil filter kit, Bypass Coolant filter kit and all the necessary filters, gaskets and hardware to get the job done right the first time. I had looked elsewhere for most of this stuff, but the packaging and completeness of there kits are second to none and the price was right. I feel my 6.0 PSD should last me a long time now.< /Review>

The post office made a mistake while shipping my order (I guess Iowa and Colorado are interchangeable).  I called to see where it was...they found out the problem...had it to me the next evening.</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Ordered a redesigned, Stainless steel EGR Cooler for my Duramax, web site and ordering process was all very straight forward and professional. Unfortunately for me Sinister is very professional and had to cancel my order because I live in California and their EGR Coolers are not yet CARB approved. The next day I confirmed that my money was refunded. In the end, I cant really complain about anything other than the Govt got in my way. I found a work around later on down the road so - I would recommend Sinister.< /text><Resp>None<//Resp><pictures>None< /pictures><gmap_id>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8< /gmap_id><Date>1493750306898<//Date><username>Chris Holmes</username>< user>

<Response>None<//Response><text>Intake bridge on my GMC sierra works great. Sinister Diesel answered all my technical questions. They were addressed in a professional & user specific manner. My Duramax has been a complete nightmare  since new. Trying to get the OEM side to work was impossible with normal driving, that included long runs empty.(50 miles+)  Towing heavy loads is mandatory to keep the exhaust system open. Trying to manage intake air on a diesel engine is stupid and asking for operational problems. You can measure & record parameters on any engine, but trying do what the Auto Industry has tried do to on a diesel engine ridiculous.<//text><user_id>113169407562284899869< /user_id>< pictures>

Horrible!!! I paid 70 bucks in shipping to have a part next day aired that took almost a week to be delivered. Trying to get refunded for my shipping and cant even talk to a manger. I have called and emailed them multiple times. I will never do business with them ever agian.<//text>

<review>My friend baught a 6.0 motor from there brand new and it was suppose to have coated Pistons high rev springs they gave him a motor that had been built a while ago that was just sitting there they didn't no for sure what was in it he said I think those r coated then upon installing the motor and every add on sinister has to offer the motor would not run wouldn't sink with ficom so I took it to the ford dealer they said wiring for so I baught all new harnesses under hood and changed them out still no fire so I called sinister again they said it was something my mechanic did so I took it to sinister mechanic he said that the cam crank timing was 7 teeth out  how do u buy a new motor that's assembled wrong so he said he would take care of it so I waited  another week and they said all the pushrods where bent and heads had bent valves too  I asked for a new motor I feel like this motor has bred abused already he responded all take care of it I owe u a credit of sum sort but I don't no till I get I get a remburst by machine shop what dose that mean
So the fixed heads and pushrods and gave it back saying all fix now enjoy soon as I started it it felt funny so I called my mechanic he put a snap on machine on it and it said a injector was bad but there brand new high performance 1 sinister sold me also they re flashed and lost my tune and said I need to purchase a new 1 I told him u lost it so he gave me a tunner next my performance fuel pump didn't work so they factory 1 back up and gave me a new hp 1 and said u hook it up also I got my truck back with masking tape holding the mass air meter on RIGGED finally I got it going and the fuel pump went out last night and had to get towed home only 50 miles on Motor and sinister parts this is the biggest waste of 20k ever 15 in parts and 5 k in labor so far so buyer be ware not strait up people< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

This place is a joke of a company that uses bait and switch pricing/tactics to get your personal information and then harass you with 10 dollar off emails,( fix the unsubscribe button) don’t waste your money with this company there are plenty of diesel companies out there with the same products.<//text>
