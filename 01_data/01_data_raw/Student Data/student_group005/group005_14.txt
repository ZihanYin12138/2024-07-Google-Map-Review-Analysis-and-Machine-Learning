<Date>1518988616067< /Date><rating>2< /rating><Review>Quick and friendly service. Called ahead it was ready in 10 mins like they said. Food was a little bland and my woman was really disappointed with the Won Ton soup. She says there weren't enough veggies and the flavor was dull. The Sesame chicken WAS pretty tasty. Not so much with the S&S pork. Sadly, if my woman isn't happy then chances are we won't be back. Eat at your own risk.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>I have never had bad service or bad food. The lunch specials are still under $6.00, and dinner combos around $10. Portions are generous, and are more food than most people can even eat at one sitting. The seating and decor is typical of most Chinese restaurants: there is a mix of round and square tables, and booths along the walls. Service is always fast. The lunch special price goes from about 11:00am to 3:00pm 7 days a week.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>Decent Chinese food for a cheap cheap price. The lunch specials get you (1) Rice or Chow Mein, (2) Eggroll, (3) Soup, and (4) Entrée item and runs you $5-6. It's always too much food for me to finish in one sitting and serves me two meals. I recommend the Mushroom Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, and Spicy Garlic Beef. But really, anything will be tasty, saucy, just unhealthy enough, plentiful, and cheap. Liked the Asian food, delicious vegetables fried rice. Amazing service . Fast service with a very clean environment. Also able to accommodate groups and big family dinner.< /review><userid>105069647397872738602</userid></record></dataset><record>

< review>
As of 11/20/18, this place is no longer Asian Garden 2. It is now called Uncle's Chinese Cuisine and is under new management.

I use to love this place back when it was Asian Garden but now it is newly renovated and has new owners. The place looks nice and when we went in to eat, it was not busy at all. Before My husband and I placed our order we asked the waitress if it was possible to order sweet and sour tofu or sesame tofu, things not on the menu and we were rudely told no. The reason why we asked for this is  because with previous owners we were able to get this even though it was not on their menu. My husband proceeds to order tofu with mixed vegetables, vegetable fried rice and egg rolls for himself and I ordered cream cheese wontons and vegetable chow mein. We also asked for tea. The first thing to come out was the fried rice and it was undercooked as hell. The second thing to come out was the tofu and it was just okay. Next to came out was the egg rolls and cream cheese wontons. I actually enjoyed the wontons. At this point, we were still not served tea but other people who came in after were given tea. A younger waiter came up and asked how everything was and we told him we have yet to receive our tea. After a while I finished my wontons and my husband finished his tofu, rice and egg rolls and THEY FORGOT ABOUT MY CHOW MEIN. During the whole time I was waiting for my chow mein I watched several people, including the waiters and waitress, stuffing their faces with food and messing with produce. My husband went to talk to one of the owners about the issue and she called the waitress over and she lied to her face about putting the order in because 10 minutes later it comes out under done and disgusting. When this place was Asian Garden, it use to get so much business from my family, my in-laws and my husband and I, this place along with the new owner will never get any of our business ever.</review>

I don't know what everyone else on here is eating, but this place is awesome :D The lunch special is cheap, you get big tasty portions, and you go home with your wallet and stomach full. Whoever is saying they get sick eating here must have a sensitive stomach because friends, family, and I all eat here all the time and we feel perfectly fine afterward. Y'all have some super sensitive white people intestines. Plus, you don't even have to purchase drinks--their citrus water is perfectly fine by itself.</Text>

Here is where my day went straight down the drain. I went here twice and the same thing occurred. I order a wor wonton soup and both times the lettuce was rotten in the soup as well as me finding little Nats in the damn soup. The rage I had when it happened again oooohhh maaaannn. People avoid this place! Also they said they went under new management but it’s the same people still there.<//Review>

<Review>I just ate here and was not impressed. I tried the Mushroom Chicken with fried rice and a bowl of Wor won Ton Soup. The mushrooms were fresh and big and the chicken was very soft and tender, but my Wor Won Ton Soup was brought with just won tons, a couple pieces of pork and cabbage. It had no flavor and if it wasn't for the fact that I had eaten the dish before I  would have never known that it was suppose to have SHRIMP AND IT NEEDS TO SIMMER SO THE BROTH CAN GET FLAVOR.
I asked them if it was suppose to have shrimp and he looked at me like I was crazy then he took the bowl to the back and put some big shrimp in it. I added soo sauce and let it sit while I finished my lunch plate.  It was still tasteless. I asked the waiter if he had anymore that had sat and simmer and he said no and that they have the same cook. The male and female waiters were very attentive, but having to pay for something that isn't good really spoiled my meal. I did not leave them a tip and asked for my change when I  paid the bill. The prices are good, but if I  have to take something home from a restaurant to give it flavor then I'm  not happy, so I  will not be coming back.</Review>< Pictures>

Staff at check in desk very nice and helpful..

Not a long wait  to be seen but the staff kept apologizing.  Tv was on and chairs were spread out safe social distance and everyone was wearing a 😷 mask.   Made my visit very comfortable and I felt safe</Review>

The staff here were very kind and the got to me quickly. I was there for a drug test (urine) and the cups they use have a portion at the bottom that is thicker than the rest of the cup and I believe it gave my sample a low temperature reading. Good for me the nurse transferred it to a different container and the reading came out fine. Another nurse may not have been as experienced and recorded a negative reading for someone.
Overall it is a well ran facility.< /Review>

<Review>I was on hold for over 12 minutes while on phone .
Their EKG machine broken no one knew how to resolve issue I was laying there shirtless for over 20 minutes with door open.
Blood couldn’t be drawn due to inexperienced tech had to drive to laboratory
In all my total wait time exceeded 2 hours - I had to leave my room a look for nurse once and another time had to physically go and search for doctor<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2ca936027d113:0xbfbdc7434e5eb32f<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Caught you guys on a busy day but you seemed to handle it well for the amount of staff you had. Loved the mobile paper work on phone! No more 2 -5 papers to fill out before your even acknowledged! Actually the people at the counter were friendlier. You would get 5 stars if you had more staff.</text>

Went for a drug screen. I waited for a while, but that was to be expected. Once I was taken back for the initial process, everything was smooth and quick. The nurse helping me, was respectful and nice. Which made everything easy.<//text>

I did not feel that the Dr. was prepared to see me. He didn't have any idea what my injury was. And he got the information from the case manager that was with me. And she seems to be wanting for me to be released before I am prepared and ready for it.</Text>

I recently visited the location in Gardena, CA. for a pre-employment screening. It was an inviting and pleasant experience. From the moment of being greeted by the front desk to the staff in the medical office everyone was warm and professional. Guidelines are being followed for COVID19 protocol and I did not feel uncomfortable. Would definitely recommend this organization for any work related issues.< /text>

Very unpleasant visit! I had to get it done.. The guy who called me, don't know his name,  know one wore a badge! He didn't wash his hands after collecting a specimen. He express wearing gloves was good enough..During my Dr. Visit during my exam he assure me he wash his hands? During my visit i felt unease and ready to leave. The doctor during his exam touch the bottom of my shoes and then came back to touch my arms..! I felt dirty and disrespected!! If u can pls don't go to this facility..</review>

Would give it a zero if possible. Was there for 2 hours and due to the inefficiencies of the ladies in front was told was going to wait atleast another hour. Lady in front is rude and not helpful at all.<//text>

<Date>1570762302553< /Date><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>My experience here was horrible. No one told me their names the whole time I was there or their job title. No one washed their hands. From the moment I walked in. No one greeted me as I stood by the counter. The front desk person answered three phone calls back to back never once stopping to acknowledge me. I didn't want to be a bother or seem impatient so I sat down. 30 minutes later a different person sat down at the reception desk and I asked him for some help. I was told to sign in and he took my ID. After filling out forms I was called in. The guy who called me in gave a run down of my exams and said I had a physical. I told him I hadn't come for a physical and he gave an assertive tone and told me, "Well you're getting one today."  I had to call my agency to confirm with Concentra that I was in fact not getting a physical that day. He then took me to my drug screening and rushed through that completely  . Everytime I tried to ask him a question he would speak over me, every single time. Even after asked me to answer one of his questions as I began to answer he would speak over me. I then had my blood draw the, the woman who drew my blood the first time said, "hello, are you you a hard stick?" I asked her in return was she good at drawing blood. She missed my vein and spent the next 2 minutes after that digging into my arm time and time again trying to find the vein with the needle plunged into my arm. She barely hit the vein, got a flush and then started saying I was a slow draw over and over. She gave up and sent another woman. The second woman was unsuccessful after sticking me in a spot on my arm no one has ever stuck me for a vein. Finally they sent the only person who helped me fill out my papers and he got a nice healthy flowing vein in less than a minute.  My other tests were succesful. Today I found out that my job screening has been delayed because the man who took my drug test administered a 7 panel test instead of the 10 panel test that was written down on my referral and was also verbally confirmed. My experience at this facility was highly stressful, disrespectful, painful and it delayed my employment. I'm unsatisfied, completely.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2ca936027d113:0xbfbdc7434e5eb32f<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

My husband went in for his appt. and we were both surprised with the the level of service. We have been to a few of these clinics and haven’t received the best of service. However, we were both surprised at the level of customer service this clinic provided. The Doctor was great! Really caring and patient with my husband.  The staff overall was really friendly and accommodating as well. Rosalie and Claudia were very helpful and patient. Not like other clinics we’ve been too. If you need to go to USHW for whatever reason....GO HERE! :)< /text>

I used to send my employees to US Healthworks, but things have changed now that it is Concentra.  There are no Doctors!  These clinics are ran by assistants!  Is that even legal!?!  Needless to say, I am transferring my account to another clinic, where I can speak to an actual Medical Doctor regarding my employee's healthcare.< /text>

The staff is excellent. The problem is how long they keep you waiting. My appointment was at 9am. Checked in and sat down till they called me. Waited 45 minutes to be called. Got my blood pressure and my temperature taken was taken to another room. Waited for another 45 mins. Finally got to see the doctor.  Less then 10 minutes later I'm being told, OK see you in 6 weeks! Another 20mins waiting to get my appointment scheduled. So almost 2*hrs waiting for a 10 min doctor visit.<//Text>

But, in any case, I have experienced the worse. I was just ready to see an specialist Doctor. When he, the Doctor, discovered that the medical chart wasn't mine. This was not a simple error. It's illegal to switch patients chart because it violates patient's confidentiality and open it to a different patient's treatment.

The office Manager rarely exercise proper Supervision and the office receptionists lack incredibly training in how to properly and professionally handle patient's request.

The system they have is the poorest I have experienced in years of dealing with Doctors. I guess this speak volumes for Worker Comp and injured cases..!

I gave them two (2) stars as a gratitude, but they have definitely planty room to improve, improve and improve their services to patient's medical needs!</text><Gmap_id>0x80c2ca936027d113:0xbfbdc7434e5eb32f<//Gmap_id><Time>1601403773891< /Time>< rate>

The doctor was awesome, he came in with good spirit and vines, he made me laugh and was just great! I went back to days later for my TB reading and was there 15mins at the most. Great place-location Broadway and Gardena in the city of Gardena. 😊</review>< Rate>

<rate>1<//rate><review>Dr Bos and her assistant are great the rest of them are terrible. They make you wait 2 or 3 hours even with an appointment and they have no effective management that I can discern. Each employee is in their own little world. One guy put a full cast on me while I kept telling him that the Doctor said a 1/2 cast, when I finally forced him to ask, when he finished the Dr. at that time said oh well that's OK because she thought I could not hear then she finally made him take it off and redo it. My injury got worse with t here treatment so I ended up needing surgery because they put an unapproved device on me because they "got stuck with them".</review>< pictures>

The staff working at the counter and phone are very difficult to work with.  They treated me and my employee with disdain.</text>

<review>I've been coming to Vince's for years and have always enjoyed their sandwiches.  Today however, I ordered the pastrami sandwich, which, more correctly, should have been called "the lettuce and pickle with a hint of pastrami sandwich".  There was hardly any meat in it.  I guess I should have gone down the street to Lucky Boy for a REAL pastrami sandwich!</review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c37c1d0a080b:0xc84aa10e042fc08a<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Personal, a good simple deli is hard to find these days. There is nothing fancy here but the meats are good and so is the bread. The condiments are just fine but they don't detract from the sandwich.

I don't know if they have non GMO, vegan, free range options here and I don't care. If you just want a good sandwich at a reasonable price this is the place.<//text>< pictures>

Vince's Deli is run by this old Korean woman who is super nice.  She and her staff make terrific sandwiches.  My favorite is the turkey avocado bacon sub.  Coupled with a bag of jalepeno potato chips and a Dr. Pepper, I am set!<//review>

Every time I've gone they've been too busy for me to stand in line and wait for the food I visualize in making and see them first-hand in the happy customers one day I'll get a chance to get a sandwich made there.</Review>

<review>It was a got evening when we went here.  Inside the restaurant there is no air conditioning.  So we ended up sitting outside on the sidewalk at their tables.  Pleasant breezes made for a pleasant meal under the trees,  with the occasional leaf that landed in our food.

Portions are generous but some of the dishes came out oddly. The babaganoush wad mostly yellow (??).

Fresh pita comes with every dish,  but mine came out burnt. Interesting touch was pomegranate sauce on the dolmas.

So, positives and negatives to balance each other out.< /review><Gmap_id>0x808561c02787b7e1:0x2cce292d7181e31c</Gmap_id><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlQb1gmBVB89pjdAU9KoJWmsnOnUtoQw_EEXaX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiBPIufWNC1Lsl-wybQMsUrAQYx1NhI2yC5Qf2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< rate>

<Review>Food is good. Came on mother's day and this past Saturday for a birthday party.  Both days we made reservations ,which one employee had,the other didn't. Large parties are overwhelming for them,  however they try their best to rectify their mistakes. We dealt with water spilled on the birthday boy's lap, wrong plates coming to our table, and obvious irritation from the wait staff if we said something was wrong. Also, the food takes a considerable time to come out
My advice : order to go, as the food is good,but not worth the experience.</Review>< pictures>

I see there are mix of review for this place and I totally understand why but the good news is that they a new owner bought the restaurant I think in July 2018. I went there for the first time a few days ago and new owner (I think Navid) provided us with a great service. He was so humble,  friendly, and dedicated to improve the food quality, experience, and the dining area. And it was so clear that he is been working so hard to provide a great experience for his customers and of course it takes time to rebuild a business and gain trust/satisfaction.
I would definitely recommend it!</text>

Food was OK-chicken was rubbery because it was not cooked enough- they charged $2 for 3 small pieces of bread because they served the salad  and meat without bread-service by the chubby young guy was horrible- he was nice but never brought the bread and the sauce or water. Never picked up the plates or refilled the tea cups with hot water. We had to summon the waiter and ask for everything.  He was socializing with other workers. I never cut them short on the tip, but I left $0 for the first time ever.</text>

It's all about that sauce, hence the name "Pomegranate"! When it comes to meat, to each is own, some like a hint of sweet in their meat, others are purist when it comes to kebab. I very much like the addition, it makes this place unique.
However:
This place has problem as similar business in this area do; they have declined in performance over the years, be it the grocery prices or business decisions. Otherwise this would be a solid 5, but this still is a pretty good place to have lunch or dinner.</Text>

Food is awesome. Especially the chicken souvlaki with rice! They also have a delicious balsamic sauce that goes on the chicken when ordering a salad. Service is inconsistent, but the food is worth it.< /review>

This was by far the best Middle-Eastern food I've ever had, and I've had a lot of Middle-Eastern food. I would 100% recommend Pomegranate to anybody that is looking to eat delicious food.< /Review>

Mediterranean food and it's wonderful. The pesto chicken pizza and gyro pizza were delicious, specifically the gyro pizza.
We also ordered the beef and chicken souvlaki combo plate and another lamb plate which name eludes me. As an Iranian, the souvlaki tasted just like the ones I eat at home. Truly delicious.<//text>

We also ordered tzatgiki and  falafel as sides.

Chicken kabobs were full of fat, lamb was very gamey and "beef" was a flavorless blob of ground hamburger. Horrible.Greek side salad was a joke, nothing resembling a Greek salad and devoid of any dressing - completely dry. Won't be back.</review>

My 17 year old cat had a large growth and was not eating well.  I spent Sunday afternoon and Monday morning calling our regular vet and several emergency vets, no one could fit me in.  My own vet could not fit me in until July.  I called Bruceville Hospital and they made room for us that afternoon.  Unfortunately, we had to put my cat down.  This vet was so understanding.  The staff was very sweet.  I thought I was fine, but I cried the whole way home.  My memory of saying goodbye to my cat is sad, but my memory of this vets office is good and I know it was meant to happen this way.  Thank you Bruceville Hospital Staff you were amazing today!</Text>

<Review>I brought my 15 year old Chihuahua Dachshund in because his face was swelling from an infected tooth. I was lucky enough to get an appointment early due to a cancellation. I initially almost brought him to a different vet but was worried about how the other vet would handle his teeth (I read a nearby vet was AWFUL with matters pertaining to the teeth. I'm so happy to have brought my little guy here. They made the entire process easy. I felt like the people here cared about my Dog. They care about me, and my family and the difficulty of the situation. I felt very comfortable leaving him in their care. He's back home, and feeling better already. I'm thankful for this place. They ensured that my dogs health and happiness remained number one priority
. I will bring my pets here from now on. I suggest that you do too.</Review>< rating>

Great Experience! I have been to several pet hospitals in Elk Grove and this was the best experience by far. I felt like the Veterinarian was honest and didn’t try and make me do unneeded tests. Very glad I went here!<//text>

I've had the hardest time finding a vet who accepts new patients.  I was told over and over as again "we will call you back" only to never get that call and with an injured pet you want help asap.  I was totally desperate by time I called Bruceville Pet Hospital.  They got us in the same day, evaluated her, performed the surgery and sent her home with everything I needed for post OP etc..  I will bring all my pets here now and highly recommend the whole team here!  They are compassionate, communicative and understanding.  Thank you to this clinic, they rock!</text>

I see some of the bad reviews about this place and it seems many of them written recently during the pandemic. Yes, waiting in the car can be a little frustrating because it does seem like they take other peoples pets before you but they are always quite busy and I don’t take it personal. You have to call when you park and let them know you’re there. They won’t come out looking for you just because you have an appointment. We found the clinic through a local ad after adopting a puppy who ended having worms and was crying/scooting all night. I emailed them late at night and surprisingly got a response early the next morning. Thankfully we were able to be seen the next day. We got the puppy package they were promoting which covered the deworming, shots and visits through out the year which was split into two payments and more affordable. Every visit we had the gals that came out to us were all very sweet and always asked and wrote down our questions. Service was always fast and the vet (Dr. Gill I believe?) always called us prior to releasing our dog to answer all our questions. Our next step is getting him neutered and I don’t doubt we’ll have a good experience with that as well. Don’t let some of the bad reviews push you away, they do care for animals and it shows.< /Review>

I used to like this Vet as I come here often for my dogs. This was the first Vet that my family decided to go since we moved here. I even referred them to my friends. However, today I came in to pick up a prescription for my dogs. I’ve called 3 days beforehand that I’ll be coming to pick up today around 11Am and everything was set. The lady that answered the call claims that I never called ahead to pick up when I did. I accidentally got disconnected from the phone and called back and she said that she already went outside and got no answer from my dogs name. I was there, just parked a little farther away so I couldn’t tell if she was looking for me. In my opinion every time I spoke to her it seems like she’s giving me attitude and I felt unwelcome. I waited a long time to get the medicine and it just wasn’t my best experience here. I hope the customer service improves because it is a good vet overall.</Review>

<username>Megan Heath</username><Date>1620076322941</Date><Rate>1<//Rate><review>I have always liked the staff at this vet. Since they opened after COVID,  I can't get my calls returned, and appointments are weeks and weeks out (about 5 most recently). This is even after they referred me to emergency for my elderly cat throwing up blood I'd tried calling weeks before and never got help or responses. When you call you either get parked on hold or referred to a recording that doesn't allow you to leave a message and then hangs up. It is a long wait no matter when you come or how much warning. My mom took her cats recently and they did not do some of the shots and procedures we were there for. They overlooked it. It's scary. Makes me wonder if they are too busy to safely tend to each animal. I have to take my cat in because she is still throwing up and we have waited so long for an appointment. But I am super disappointed and sad to say I'm looking for a new vet. There is a particular employee that is attitudinal every time I encounter her. Whether she is right or not. I think they are over worked. Dr. Paul and Dr. Gill are very nice and seem caring,  but this new set up they have is going downhill fast.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Do not recommend this place for your pets. Made an appointment for 10.20. Was out waiting in the parking lot until 11.50 for them to come and get my dog. No one showed up for 30 mints and I gave them a call. They said there is an emergency. My question is if you are a clinic taking by appointments then you should know if you are busy enough for that day and do not take any appointments from people. Emergency should be treated at ER. This was the first place I ever had to turn back without my dog get seen. Especially I drove 30mint for the appointment. Defiantly not professional. People who came after us got their pets seen. That was so wrong. If you can make any better for another person then please know your schedule and do not take appointments if busy. Bad place for sure</review>< pics>

<review>Thank you so much for all your help Gabino, without your help and the doctors as well this wouldn't have happened and I would have had a horrible outcome I'm sure.

This is the most unprofessional business I have ever been to. I checked in. A blonde lady came out  explained the procedure how you cannot go in with your dog. I was using my freedom of speech and asked her, "how are we going to speak with the doctor to see if he's good or not and what he is doing". I just said," it's really funny that they can open restaurants up and people can get their haircuts but you can't go in with your dog to a vet". Apparently she got offended. The lady came out and had the nerve to tell me that the last customer told  her I was bad-mouthing them and cursing. I never bad mouth them or cursed. There was no reason for it. I can't believe a staff member would put this off on another customer and lie like that.. They told me to leave. I tried to get the lady's name but they declined to tell me. This is the most unprofessional business I have ever been to. If they had no stars that's what I would give this company.<//text>

<Date>1604162273875<//Date><rate>1<//rate><Text>While the actual veterinarian here seemed reasonable the one and only time I spoke with him, the office staff were very unprofessional. I brought our 6-month old kitten in to be spayed last weekend and was made to wait for 45 minutes outside when picking her up while staff helped 3 other clients who all arrived more than 10 minutes after I did. Staff did provide a $20 discount when I pointed this out so I was prepared to forgive, until our kitten developed complications.

They advertise that they provide "Emergency Services", but what they mean is "Drop off your pet and we'll get to her when we can work her in." No triage was done to determine whether her needs were urgent until several hours later, once I called to complain. My wife had been told by staff that it would be "a couple hours", but the office manager denied this (as if my wife was lying), saying drop-offs mean all day. If triage had been done and determined that she could wait, we would've been fine with that.

The worst part was when the office manager called me back (at work) to give me a speech about how there needs to be trust on both sides for a working relationship, blah, blah, blah, and that they didn't want to work with us. Of course, I had already decided we would never return. She said our kitten was ready to be picked up (she wasn't). A half-hour later the Dr called me, saying he was still working on her and he would call me in 30 minutes (never heard from him again). My wife and daughter waited in the parking lot for almost 1 1/2 hours after the manager said "she's ready to go".

The arrogance of the office staff here is just about the worst I've ever experienced from a vet. The concept of customer service is clearly not a priority here, and if you should actually complain (politely and reasonably, with no raised voices or profanity) they'll put it on you and show you the door. I guess that's what you get from a strip mall vet.<//Text>< Pics>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>This place is so unprofessional it's almost comical. I had my dog tested for a lump and the first visit went really well. Then they didn't call me to give the results and when I called multiple times, it took them a week to get back to me. They suggested I get the lump removed, so I went ahead and asked to schedule an appointment. The doctor didn't return my calls at all and its been over a week. Finally I just asked for the records on the procedure and will be going elsewhere< /Review>< pictures>

I found it to be great service with Covid 19.  Had my Maddy girls teeth cleaned.  Everyone treated her professionaly with loving kindness.  Very pleased with job well done.   More than fair fees.  They trimmed her nails and gave her a bath at no extra charge.  First visit no charge also!  I have already told FRIENDS who are excited to try them out!  Thank you all!<//Review>

Staff is rude and not helpful. Doctor Gill is not professional and just takes your money. Dose not do a Thorough job. Was charged an Examination fee x2. That I was not aware of when I booked the apt. My bog had a rash but doctor didn’t mention anything about it in his report and I believe it’s because he didn’t Examine the dog but charged me for it. Called the office and doctor did not want to speak to me And have the office technician translate and continue to put me on hold back-and-forth when he could’ve just got on the phone since he took my money 30 minutes prior<//Text>

I have been promised call backs to follow up on lab results from the doctor to no avail.  I 3 times had to call the clinic to find out.  Medication refills are a debacle.  Our oldest dog is on two pain meds which ran out today.  Last week I called and spoke to someone who agreed to fax his two prescriptions to Costco.  Today I call Costco and they never heard from Vet.  When I call Vet they tell me they have no record of my call and Rx refill request.  Then they have the audacity to tell me their process does not allow them to fax to Costco, and that Costco must fax them.  Exactly opposite of what they told me last week.  Additionally, our other dog already has one med filled at Costco and I can tell you the Vet faxed to Costco, and Costco did not fax to Vet requesting.  Please understand your own processes rather then telling customers we are crazy and you never fax to Costco.  If your medications prices weren't so unreasonable this whole issue would be mute.  Do yourselves a favor Elk Grove, take your beloved Pets elsewhere and never fill your medications here.  Costco is 1/3 rd to 1/2 the price.  My family will be changing Vets immediately.  I would rather drive further then get the terrible services this Vet office provides.< /review>< resp>

Then other animals including skunks started eating the food so if he left to explore the food would be gone and he would leave again.

They answered the phone and fit me in even though they were extremely busy! The staff  were all genuinely concerned about the health of my cat. Dr. Paul took the time to go over her health history and gave a lot of advice. It was my first visit but I have other cats so I will definitely be going back.< /Review>

Rude out of the gate RUDE...Two technicians came out and were just blatently rude. Wouldnt answer any questions..
Not medical advice...... QUESTIONS. They acted like I asked their bra size and just made whole situation awkward. They wouldnt answer ANY questions and i had never been there. They made me feel uncomfortable at this location...Terrible vet with young inexperienced technicians. The reason i say bad vet is i cant imagine a scenario where these two techs would be helpful in any situation. They are too scared and nervous to answer any questions. Being a new client imma have questions i need answered.  They made a nice visit to vet awkward and nerve racking and I never got the help i needed. I left because of the way the technicians acted. Would NOT reccomend this places

<review>I was searching for a new Vet and came upon the reviews in Yelp for Dr. Gill and the staff at Bruceville Pet Hospital. Let me tell you these folks are very good, involved, and attentive to the needs of your pet.

Not only are they available to answer any questions you may have but they also took great care of my Pup when I needed them most.

I wanted to let you folks at BPH know that I’m very grateful and I will continue to bring you my furbabies going forward, as well as telling everyone I know about your business.

Thank you for such excellent and thorough care of my dog. He’s doing much better today as a result of your hard work.

Thank you, really.

We have recently discovered Bruceville Vet Hospital and they have been more than fair and accommodating. Even with same-day appointments and what most veterinarians would consider an emergency visit, Bruceville charges the same rate whether it last minute or an appointment made ahead of time. Our other vet charges $120.00 just to walk in the door!

We recommend them for their caring and thorough vet staff, they’re affordable pricing, their flexible hours and seven day work week, and their ability to work with rescues and the public. They really care about animals and we look forward to a long lasting relationship to save more lives!</Text>< user_name>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>If I could give zero or half a star, I would.
We rescued a German Shepherd a little over a year. We brought him to this clinic because it was recommended to us by someone who works at the shelter where we got him. He has idiopathic epilepsy and requires medication daily to prevent the seizures from happening. If he misses a dose he is likely to have Grand Mal seizures within days. We have had issues with the staff every time that we need his prescription renewed. They assure us that the order will be put in same day (within an hour or so) - and it never is. They take days to fax the prescription to our pharmacy and by then he is typically out of his medication or doesn't have enough for his full dose. It takes us calling the pharmacy to check to see if they have received the prescription, and then the office to see if they have sent it - multiple times a day until it gets done. We typically spend two to three days playing phone tag to get his prescription filled. You would think they would be on top of filling a medication that is so vital to his health.
The staff is rude and they do not look at his chart before seeing him. We have to re-explain everything about his history (even the medication that they are prescribing him and why), first to the assistant and then again to the vet when he comes in. The check ups are done lazily and they only take his temperature - they don't check anything else like most vets would during a check up unless we have specific issues we want to bring to their attention.
The ONLY reason I would consider giving them even a half of a star would be because they will work with your budget if it's a little tight.
Needless to say, we will be switching clinics very soon.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I recently moved to Sacramento from the Bay Area and had yet to find a vet, when my 12-year-old terrier mix started having trouble breathing and was shaking non-stop. I went online and read reviews for a dozen vet clinics around the area. Let me tell you, I'm so glad I found Bruceville Pet Hospital! Not only did they get me in the same day, the staff was so friendly and welcoming that I just knew I found the right place! The prices were very affordable - with the full blood panel testing that was done, the x-rays, the radiologist consult, the three hours that I had to leave her there (which I wasn't charged for) and the 4 new meds that I came home with - it was under $500. I thought I would be spending upwards of a thousand dollars, for sure, which I can't afford. Unfortunately, my fur baby is in liver failure, among other things due to her age. The vet was so kind and explained everything that was going on with her. I'm so happy with my experience that my future dogs will also be part of this vet family!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x809ac7947f9da339:0x4ebe7b50d49450d8< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Made an urgent appointment for Bruceville Pet Hospital to see my cat the next day. The lady on the phone was very kind and was able to fit us in on short notice. So far so good....

Fast forward to the next day, I arrive 10 minutes before my appointment and walk up to the front door. It’s locked. No one is inside. There is no sign on the door. Their hours (they open at 8am and my appointment was for a little after 9:20am) are posted, but no staff are there and the lights are off. I try calling, but there is no answer, and no voicemail or answering machine.

There are at least 4 other people waiting outside, all with appointments that this vet and their staff no showed to. I rearranged work and called in some favors to get my cat seen, all for nothing. I’m disappointed in this, but I do hope the staff and vets are OK if an emergency happened.< /review><name>Seth DuVernay< /name><UserId.>113675143681518189266<//UserId.></record>

I HATE being rude, or writing bad reviews but I feel it’s important for other people to know and for the staff to know that their scheduling needs work. I had an appointment and was going to be a first time client, at 5:40pm. Just to get my labs first round of shots.... they close at 7pm and I walked out at 6:50pm and all they did was take my dogs temperature and I guess forgot me in the room. After I walked out and loaded my dog up a receptionist came out to apologize and say they could do something for the next bill...... but in all honesty it was just a really bad first impression and did not win me over what so ever.<//Review>

I was sceptical as i saw no review's and worried since my baby was getting fixed, however upon setting up our appointment it was wonderful an very open for availability. They called me prior to make sure everything was a go and today we were welcomed on arrival by a very nice, kind hearted soul who helped me and walked me through everything. I'm so sorry i forgot her name she was awesome. I highly recommend this hospital. My baby is home happy and healthy.<//text>

This is an amazing gas station amazing price Better Price than the Chevron down the street I'll tell you that right now they have lower prices on a lot of things majority of the things that are price in there are amazingly priced and just be surprises and most of the gas stations that are close by cuz it's really only a couple gas stations in that City anyway but I highly recommend anybody to go to Arco it's the best place to go and visit and to get a good experience clean environment well put together tile floors well put together architecture of a building signs everything professionally made and put together and well-maintained and their maintenance is well on point and it's just all-around great staff great people and great management I love the Sarco it's a wonderful place to go and visit and get gasoline at a price that's affordable other than the other ones that are trying to take advantage of you over the other gas stations that you might see< /Text>

3 weeks ago I went in to purchase a gas card for a Christmas present I went in to purchase it but the gentleman behind the register did not know how to run the gift card function so not only did he charge me after I told Him I don't mind coming back in the morning to Purchase it from someone that knew how to sell me a gift card I still haven't been refunded after 3 weeks going back and forth with the owner of the gas station. Really ridiculous so now I have to take matters in my own hands call Arco and my bank and plan on yelping this gas station .. I will never go back in this was actually my first time in this gas station just thought it would be easy run in purchase for my niece and leave but not that way at all. This is why everyone that visits Moorpark should just go to Chevron or 76 gas station down the street(where I should have gone in the first place. Hopefully this gas station closes soon just like the other gas stations before. Really Ridiculous that I'm even writing a review on something that could have been taken care of  I showed my receipt that my funds were suppose to refund and my bank account. This is just a lesson on why I should or my family and friends should never go to a Arco Am Pm again< /Text>

I’ve had many positive experiences here. The youth service at 7 pm on Thursdays is amazing, it is mostly in English and will impact your life. Sunday services are great too, come to the 12 pm service for a more modern & English experience. Nine am service is completely in Russian.< /text>

This is such a big church! Went there for the first time last Sunday evening for the concert,  walked around, I love the place, looks like the members of the church really care about their building. Love the big screen behind the stage! Members and pastors are friendly. Praise God for such a big church, and the works they do for God!!!< /Text>

Lovely people with good hearts that have been providing aid to the Sacramento region as well as worldwide. They send out containers full of clothes and non-perishable food to places that are War-torn and third world countries where people are in poverty. Even in time of need back when my father passed they helped my get back on our feet.<//review>

From a military gym to a great place to serve the LORD! I would encourage everyone, whether young or older, please check out the youth service. They are almost every Thursday at 7:00. Be prepared for a life changing experience! It all begins with the greeters and then ends with the closing prayer, your time here will feel like it just flew by. See ya all there!<//Review>< gmap_id>

An absolutely great church! They have a great youth ministry that is thriving and growing, and the people are some of the most caring and loving individuals I have ever met. Every Thursday at 7 they have their youth services, which are filled with great word and worship every week. It's an amazing place to get plugged in and become a part of the body of Christ! Feel free to visit anytime, be blessed!</review>

There are also many services that one can attend. On Sunday there are literally three main services that can be attended. First service is Russian but we have a translation table in the back. The second service is English! There is also a youth service that is every Thursday!

Bethany is such a wonderful church! I love how welcoming and warm it is. The Youth is so on fire! You can feel the presence of the Holy Spirit! Would recommend it to anyone. Everyone is so hard-working, from the ushers to the secretaries, to the pastors. Love their Bible School. They invite a lot of cool guest speakers and you can feel yourself grow spiritually day by day.< /Review>

Great church with a great community. Sunday services are in russian, there is translation found in the back of sanctuary, but there is talk of an English service. Youth service is in English, and is really powerful, as well as the Friday night prayers.</review>

Bethany Slavic Missionary Church is an amazing church that is always welcoming! It has many events and groups for youth to get involved in! I think our youth is one of the best youth services I've been too! It has a great balance of worship and sermon preaching! There are also many groups for the older generation, such as women's groups and breakfasts'. The Sunday services are also great! I'm very glad we have a service for the older generation and a service for more of the younger generation! One thing we can work on is getting a service on Sunday fully in English! I love this church a lot and I'm glad God has placed me and my family in this church!< /Review>

Bethany is a very Welcoming place! They have incredible youth services on Thursdays at 7:15pm. Their youth is positive and outgoing! They also have a café nearby which serves delicious Temple Coffee and provides excellent customer service. In 2013 they launched Bethany Bible School which is a program that inspires, educates, and equips young adults to live a life devoted to following Jesus! I love spending my time at Bethany! :)< /Text>

This is an amazing church! I have attended Bethany since I was five years old. They have some great Sunday School classes for kids, separate classes for teens, phenomenal youth/Sunday services, different, fun events, incredible prayers, choir for all ages, and a lot of caring, loving people. It's definitely a place where you can grow spiritually, make new friends, be involved in a ministry, and be part of one big family. They also have a remarkable cafe where you can buy some delicious(and I mean Delicious) food and hang out with friends!!!</text>

<Review>Bethany is an amazing church. The presence of the Holy Spirit is very rich in the place.  The Sunday services are usually held in Russian; however, they offer amazing translation services.  The 12pm service also includes a sermon in English.  The singing and worship is a mixture of both, Russian and English, bringing out the beauty of both cultures. They offer a great Sunday school program for all ages, teen ministry, adult ministry, and amazing youth. The people at the church are welcoming and will bless you.  There are many opportunities to get involved at this church! I recommend this church to anyone who is searching for the truth and wants to experience the Holy Spirit move in their life.<//Review>< pics>

Youth service that takes place every Thursday at 7pm are amazing! I really recommend it.There are prayers a couple times a week and people that are ready to reach out/support. Currently, I am in their Bethany Bible School Program and I have learned so much! We have amazing teachers/preachers/pastors coming from different states and countries, outreaches going on every week, and many other events that happen. It's really great.<//text>< pictures>

My home church! Great place to worship and fall in love with God.
Great youth services and prayers and worship.  You really feel God's presence here with all the loving people and God-fearing leaders. It was also fun attending Bethany Bible School. Learned a lot about God and His word there with incredible teachers from all around the world and states. I would recommend this church to anybody looking for a home church.</review>

I've been attending here all my life and the services here are amazing! There are 2 services on Sundays from 9am or 12pm. The youth services are Thursdays at 7pm. There are many ministries to get involved in and I'm happy to see the church growing. Definitely recommend checking out Bethany!< /text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Great Church! Good community of people! Serious about salvation found in Jesus Christ alone. Russian speaking, but also have English centered services.

WARNING ... Slavic people in general have a problem understanding speed limits and courteous driving. They will literally put a fear of God into you while entering or exiting the Church parking area. That or give you a serious case of road rage...God help me. Oh, did I mention that they own a cemetery out back... Just sayn' 😉<//Review>< Pictures>

It's my church. Of course I like it. It's pretty big so it's hard to get really close with everyone, but that also helps the new people integrate. It's a Slavic church, Pentecostal denomination, but everyone is welcome. Most services are in Russian but there is an English sermon at the noon Sunday service. Youth on Thursdays is entirely in English. Sunday school and other classes can be either English or Russian. Overall, it's a large church that does a good job of keeping true to its founding principles.< /Review>

Bethany is very spiritually uplifting! It's a church that is very passionate about God. The youth is great. They have a wonderful teen ministery. The bible school is enriching! Even though I don't have a Slavic heritage, everyone has been very welcoming and sweet towards me. I would recommend anyone to come and visit. If you don't speak Russian, no problem, they have translation devices during the weekend services towards the back and the youth services on Thursdays are almost always in English.</text>

An amazing church and truly welcoming, the youth program is thriving. It is primarily a Russian church but they have vision of an English service! Don’t be afraid of Slavic grandmas just say “slava Bogu” and they will bless you, love you, proclaim the things of God and prosperity into your life. Give it a shot, as a regular attender at Bethany I will personally greet you!< /Text>

Awesome church!  Youth is very welcoming and the older people are so sweet. The parents or grandma's and grandpa's try to help out with as much as they can, and you can see that they want the best for the youth here, even if their are disagreements, we all have the same goal and that is to praise God and serve Him and our community. I also love how there is a cafe that not only serves beverages but great food and customer service.< /Text>

Very powerful church. The youth there is amazing and friendly. Very conservative for today's culture but overall, it's a blessing to the community. Very beautiful location but a bit out of the way. The cafe is organized and kept running smoothly. They have some interesting items on the menu. Overall, grrrrrrrrrreat church. Tony the Tiger.<//Text>

I've been going to this church for a while and to see how much it has changed is amazing. This church is growing spiritually and to be part of it is awesome. if your looking for a church that you want to get more involved with then Bethany is a great place to start. They have so many great ministers you could get plugged into. For example they have kids ministries like kids choir, Sunday School, and a Garden of Kids program. They have great worship teams that are always looking for people who want to use their talent of singing, playing any instrument, even lights and audio. You could also get involved in media. Your talent for videography and photography will always be helpful at big conferences, big events, and camps. They have many more things you could get plugged into. This church is great and I would recommend you guys to come and see for yourself on our youth services on Thursdays at 7.< /Review>

< Review>
Love this church! Attended for the past 17 years, they have made tons of changes, a lot of improvements! Currently undergoing construction in their main auditorium and are expecting a bigger and better main sanctuary. With their new youth pastor on board the church is undergoing improvements both outwardly and inwardly. Ushers are friendly, services are amazing, and worship is filled with the presence of God! Definitely a great place to meet new people who love God.

They provide a youth service in English every Thursday (@7:30pm) for both high school and college students, and then 3 services on Sundays. One at 9:00am (for older members) one at 12:00pm (for young married people, and kids, usually in English) and one at 6:30pm. Sunday morning services are usually in Russian, however they do provide english translations through ear phones that are provided in the back. The best service for English speakers would be our 12:00pm service and Thursday evening youth service:)

There is something going on at church every single day. There are opportunities to get involved in Choir, Band, Youth Ministries, Home Groups, Bible Schools, Sunday School, Teen Bible School, Cafe, and more with the leadership admin staff.

Bethany also has prayer nights every Monday and Friday evening @9;30pm. These are so filled with God's presence and people who love and care about each other.

Summer is also filled with Saturday Evening Services Outside and several other outdoor events as well as TONS of different summer camp opportunities for kids and teens of all ages.

This church has a lot to offer for those who are interested in getting involved and being a part of something big in the community!

Give us a visit, bring a friend, we'll be happy to have you!<//Review>

This church is unique in the way it approaches certain subjects, head on and biblically. I have a massive amount of respect for the leaders and what they do. The youth band is amazing but more importantly, the gospel is the center of it all. The youth is passionate about what they do and bringing others to Christ in a respectable, gentle and honest way. Their staff is a blessing to not only the Slavic community but the missions they do around the world, including Ukraine, Mexico, Germany,etc. I never thought this church would be such a blessing in my life.< /Review>

<Text>Amazing church!! It is always a blessing to attend this church because the people are amazing and the services are just so moved by the power of the Holy Spirit. The main services are typically in Russian but the youth service is in English so that you can get the best of both worlds. If you are looking for a church to join I would definetly recommend stopping by Bethany.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

From the moment I walked through the doors of this church, I have never stopped loving it! You are surrounded by so many God-loving people who are always there to support you in everything. Such a beautiful presence of God is felt at every service you attend! I call this place my 2nd home :) This church also has a phenomenal program called the Bethany Bible School that has stirred up such a passion in the young individuals that attend it. I recommend this 5 month program to all who hunger for the Truth and want a change in their life!< /review>

Bethany Slavic Missionary is a great church, friendly people, wonderful worship music, and Bible-based preaching/teaching. Very easy to be involved because of the numerious missionary opportunities. Very loving and caring people. Also has an amazing Bible School that equips students spiritually for a missionary life. A school I'm proud to be a part of.<//review>

Always loved this Church, you can get invloved so easily and quickly. I love how the Church is changing in a few places that needed improvment. Very anointed and many great things are happening. I recommend this church to any person who is looking for a church.< /Review>

Love coming here, food is always fresh and made to order. The same lady is always there, and always friendly. Tostada Mixta is my go to every time, leaving the crab meat out and it never fails to satisfy my mariscos craving!<//Text>

I called to place an order I was not done when the lady hanged up on me. I called back to tell her I wasn’t don’t ordering she answered me with an attitude and she said “ yeah you already told me what you wanted” I told her I wasn’t done. I told her to cancel my order. I rather give my business where I’m treated like my money matters! Never again going there.< /Review>

<Text>Very friendly staff and service was fast. Delicious food! I highly recommend the shrimp tostada. Best sea food spot I’ve found in Los Angeles area. It’s in the corner of the street (hidden) but easy to find once arriving to the location</Text>< Pictures>

I loved the shrimp tostada, it's super fresh and raw, pickled in lemon. So tasty! I also had 7 seafood soup, several large shrimps, 2 mussels, plenty of octopus, and fish. Yes I realize that's only 4, but my favorite 4. Rice was good with soup, as well as the carrots and thinly sliced potatoes. I brought home a giant shrimp burrito for my dad and he loved it!

And yes this place is easy to miss Bc it is tucked into the corner of the oddly shaped mini mall.<//review>

The staff is very friendly.
The menu pricing is inexpensive.
The menu is limited, but overall really good.
I've tried everything on the menu many times, it's ALL REALLY GOOD! ☺</review>

Ask for ceviche de camaron and they gave it to me raw, still black. It should be a special request for them to serve it this way. Gross.< /Text>

Ive had my car and my dad's cars and trucks get worked on here and everytime they do an amazing job. They are always truly honest and have great, fair prices. I've had other mechanics quote me high prices and crazy unnecessary amount of work when Mendez quotes me half the price and the correct work that needs to be done. I travel from Santa Ana to get my card worked on here. Great place . Thank you Mendez !< /text>

<Text>Great place for plug and patch. Open extra late.
Went back and had breaks done.
Very good prices on that as well.
Usually do the brakes myself.
Currently on injured list.
It was a big help.

I had an amazing experience here. I went with a friend for her birthday. We signed up online the day before on the website. As we walked up to the door, the woman smiled at us through the glass door which always makes me feel welcome. She was pure fun and warmth. My friend and I had a blast! They provided everything you needed with a smile on their faces. I plan on returning because I left there grinning from ear to ear. I would highly recommend booking a date night/girls night/friend hangout there because it was so much fun and I felt so happy and comfortable. Don't be afraid if you're not good at painting, they show you step by step and at the end of the night it's about having fun.</Text>

Always super fun! I have absolutely ZERO talent as an artist, but every time I leave Joyful Expressions, I have a great piece of art to hang.
The environment is welcoming, the instructors are always patient and the music keeps your creative juices flowing! The drinks might help a bit, too.
I’ve been there quite a few times over the years and I always have a blast!
Highly recommended!</review>

<Review>1st time visitor from Kentucky back in November 2020. Loved the atmosphere. The owners were great & had really great energy. Made me & my girls feel comfortable to be there. We had a really good time. They talked us through our art pieces well & I am quite pleased with how mine came out. Would definitely visit again</Review>< Pictures>

Love! Love! Love this place! We took my sister for her birthday, we had such a great time. Everyone was professional and fun. The food was very tasty. It was a great experience and my sister enjoyed herself, I would definitely go back. I am thinking about taking my husband.

<text>I highly recommend Joyful Expressions. I experienced Joyful Expressions for the 1st time on my 50th birthday along with 7 of my closest friends and we all had an amazing time.   The staff was very nice and entertaining. If your looking for something different try Joyful Expressions, you won't regret it! 👍🏾👍🏾</text>< Rate>

I have hosted numerous Paint and Sip events with Joyful Expressions. Each has been a treat for me and my guests.  We have so much fun laughing, painting, sipping and laughing some more. I have a couple of my paintings hanging in my home, not all of them LOL. You highly recommend you experience Joyful Expressions for yourself and a friend.<//review>

My daughter-in-law and I went for a Saturday class at the Carson studio. The instructor was super friendly and the process was so easy to follow. They offered us bottomless margaritas and wine... made the class so much fun and relaxing. Came away with a really cute painting that I put on display for all my girlfriends to see. They loved it and are now planning on having a bridal shower there! Thank you Joyful Expressions!< /Review>

Located in a nice complex we were greeted with a warm welcome. The staff are very laid back and funny. There was a group celebrating a birthday which they acknowledged, and made it part of the class. The instructor is very good, funny, and very hospitable. we had a great time and will be going back again.< /text>

<text>Lovely staff at joyful expressions  came out to host my birthday sip and paint last July and everything was so nice.  Staff was patient helpful and a royal vibe, I loved how they walked around and mingled with my guest and all the funny adult like commentary along the way 😂🙌🏽 It was a good celebration 🎉 🎨 🍹</text></record>

<user_name>roslyn jones<//user_name><Review>I've had only the absolute BEST experiences with Joyful Expressions Paint & Taste!!! Pre-COVID pandemic I've participated at their studio, at a friends private home party, and as a fundraiser for my church Missionaries... I mean it when I say each time was AMAZINGLY FUN!!!! EVERY Instructor was AWESOME! I have and will continue to refer them to family, friends, and strangers, and I'm looking forward to my sisters and I doing a virtual event!</Review>< Pictures>

This place is awesome. It's not only a social event it's a party. Music wine and fun painting. You don't need to be a artist the instructor guides you with excellence. Have fun<//Review>

<review>The instructor made everyone attending the session feel very welcome and at ease. She explained the process, materials, and application of each item is such a concise and effective manner, the intimidation factor of painting quickly disappeared. I had a Great time.

Joyful Expressions is an excellent paint and sip company. Their customer service is superb and they will even help you customize (tweak) your painting according to your own vision. I have had a private birthday party celebration onsite as well as participated in several virtual paint and sip while receiving the same respectful, entertaining, professional service every time.<//Text>

<Review>Went to my first paint and sip at Joyful Expressions’ location on Western Saturday night. We had such a great time. Joy is a wonderful instructor who makes it fun to play with painting and channel my creativity. We all discovered a little inner sexy.

I was invited to a Birthday Celebration. I had the most fun painting listening to the music and socializing with the other guest. I only new the Birthday Girl but by the end of class I felt like I had know everyone in the room awhile. The hostesses made everyone feel comfortable and had a sense of humor. We shared laughs and created some lovely art work. They taught us step by step how to create a piece to be proud of and look at with an.enjoyable.memory. I simply loved the class and the entire setting. I will be attending another of these fun sessions.</text>

My daughters gave me a Joyful Expressions, Mother's Day gift.  A gift and expression I STILL TREASURE,  4 years later and I got the gift of my painting that was done by me, "getting-consistent-C-since elementary school,  sometimes a flat our D" in artd and crafts".  sHres hospitality, upbeat friends and day.  God's will,  and many prayers,  this SMALL BUSINESS SURVIVES COVID 19.< /review>

< review>
I’ve had TWO back to back birthday parties here (18th and 19th) and always enjoyed it. They let us set up themed bday snacks and my cakes on a table inside. We could play our own music on their speaker. The instructors were always so nice and lively. My family and friends both enjoyed the experience, so it’s for a wide range of ages. They also have the prettiest paintings for you to choose from too no matter your experience level in painting. It’s a step by step process so it was always easy to follow along.<//review>

<review>I went here in 2018 for a friend's bridal party meet'n'greet. I absolutely loved it. The staff is amazingly friendly and witty and the painting tutorial was fun, funny,  and a little suggestive lol. It was a very well-made atmosphere. We had drinks and were able to take our paintings home. :) I'd definitely recommend and go back once it's safe.< /review>< pics>

My sisters and I brought my mother here for her birthday and we had a great time. This is maybe the second time I have given 5 stars in any review. The instructors brought the artistic skills out of me I didn’t know I had “I CAN PAINT Y’all”  I followed instructions and I had a visual of what I was to paint which helped. We left happy and satisfied went home and placed my painting on the wall. If you decide to try this place you can take snacks and wine so enjoy.</text>

<Text>Loved my experience! I took a love one here for a birthday celebration! We did the Nipsey inspired Painting... the teacher was a great teacher... she made painting seem so easy and she made sure she went around and told everyone how much of a good job they did! I enjoyed the Prolific shots served that day and best part is this location is right here in my own neighborhood! Thank you for providing art to the community, giving a place of joyful expressions!!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

The staff is courteous, pleasant and will even assist you with your paintings of needed. The owner Joy has a beautiful bright spirit. She always has a smile on her face and walks you through the journey of creating your masterpiece. Every instructor there is amazing! Great place.

I love love love Joyful Expression this is the best sip n paint studio EVER.  Her instructors are the best. They are patient, fun, and great at what they do. They make like you you've known them forever. I've been to her studio in Gardena and to a couple of privately hosted parties ALL experiences were awesome.
AND Joy herself is the sweetest person ever. She is so down to earth and goes out of her way to ensure your paint in sip experience is epic. Don't sleep on Joyful Expression they are the bomb!!!!!< /review>

<text>This was one of the best ways to bond and learn about individuals seeking to become a part of our organization.  We talked, laughed and enjoyed each other's company.  We shared the result of our finished product.  Each one was unique although the products used were the same.  This was a great experience which created the feeling that you were talented and your work although different from others was very special.</text><pics>None<//pics>< GmapID>

Really great for a date night. The deals are great especially on Tuesday nights. $30 for a glass of margarita and two tacos. Also, they have a bar to purchase other drinks. Well worth the money and it’s black own too. Will definitely going back soon!!!!!!<//Text>

I threw my cousins surprise birthday here and omg we had so much fun! Even the men that I didn’t think would like it enjoyed it! I catered Chick-fil-A and we brought wine and beer. They poured the wine for us and were super helpful. My group definitely enjoyed the x-rated commentary! It was a great setting! I will definitely do this again!</text>

The staff was great, Jasmine and Liz were very patient with my group of friends and family members. I told them that they would get a little rowdy, they said they would be able to handle my group. With their help we all paint wonderful pictures and a great time.< /Review>< pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>We (my eight siblings and I), experienced Joyful Expressions, suggested by my niece, during our family reunion. The atmosphere, food, and people was outstanding. The most amazing and memorable was the instructor.  Her talent and expertise in making each of us feel like real artists; and for bringing out our artistic side was remarkable. A special shout out to “Joy” and her talented assistant. Joyful Expressions is fun-filled; relaxing; and an overall awesome experience. I recommend Joyful Expressions to couples, birthday gatherings, family reunions, individuals; or anyone wanting a change of atmosphere while relaxing and painting. I give Joyful Expressions a raving five-star, two thumbs up review.< /Review>< Pics>

I chose Joyful Expression as a venue to help my cousin celebrate her birthday with some friends.
The atmosphere was upbeat and friendly, our host was fun and positive and the price was reasonable which included all supplies plus food and bottomless mimosas. I’ve never painted a portrait before so I was impressed with the simple step by step instructions of how to create a masterpiece portrait. My experience was fun, brought out my creative juices and provided an opportunity for me to feel like a kid again. Give it a try, you won’t regret it!<//review>

Joyful expressions in Gardena is a very exciting experience. You paint, sip, laugh and sometime eat. I've had the pleasure of attending on several occasions and will be returning when time permits. I can honestly say it's addicting<//Review>

Joyful expressions. Excellent customer service, professionalism at its best. Be ready to laugh and have lots of fun. Most of all with Joyful Expressions you don’t have to be Picasso or Amanti  to unleash a magnificent piece of artwork. So Sit back relax sip on what makes you happy and enjoy an elegant time with Joyful expressions. Michelle  Powell<//Review>

This is place is around the corner from my home so I come here randomly , preferably Taco Tuesdays lol and To be honest . I can’t think of a better place to bring your friends and family . Welcoming place , Fun ,  and They teach you how to paint so you don’t need to already know how . Definitely one of my favorite places</review>

I interviewed several companies before I chose Joyful Expressions. I’m so glad I did! I hosted a Girls Night Paint & Sip party and we all had a blast! The instructors that guided us through our night were very patient, professional and helped us have an enjoyable experience. The owner even stopped by to make sure we were having a good time. I’m considering hosting another event soon.<//text>

I definitely would recommend joyful expressions if you love to meet new people and try new things. I’ll be back soon myself and I’m even thinking about having my birthday party here!!! 😘😍❤️ P. S. Don’t go in expecting your painting to look like the original because it never will unfortunately. Your work is your own and you should love it and be confident about it. You’ll get better with time. If that still doesn’t work for you sprinkle or drown it in glitter, whichever works for you because that always makes it better!!! 😉😌🤗< /review>< Pictures>

I enjoyed the experience! I went for my sister’s birthday party and everyone had such a great time . We ate, drank, painted and celebrated our girl. The staff and instructors were so much fun too, knowledgeable and made my first time creation stress free and special. I want to come back and do it again . Great place and atmosphere to gather together, have a good time and do something positive.< /Review>

We were guided step by step, Although I am not the best at painting the instructor reassured me that it’s my artwork  to do the best I can  & just trust the process. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking to enjoy a date night, birthday, anniversary or even a girls night!< /Text><user_name>Ms Avery_<//user_name><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

I've been here too many times to count and have had a great experience everytime. Sometimes I'm with friends and sometimes alone, but the staff are all very welcoming so it makes no difference.  The instructors are knowledgeable and patient and will guide you through each step.....you're sure to have a masterpiece that reflects your best efforts.<//text>

Excellent experience! I came here for one of my dear friend's birthday celebration and I was pleasantly surprised. My painting came out amazing and I suck at drawing/art. Joy is such a nice art instructor and she's so funny. I will definitely come back here and I recommend it to anyone looking to try something different. Also, they have a bar for your "adult beverage" needs<//text>

Not to mention Ms. Joy(whom I encountered) was amazing with the step by step instructions. Can't wait to join you in another session. Keep up the good work Ms. Joy</text>

We had a grand time for my birthday “Big Diva Bash”... the Host and Hostess were fabulous (Liz and Roy).  It was a first experience for me and I will tell you if you saw my painting (better than the artist Picasso).  I’m telling everybody about Joyful Expressions!  Had an absolute great time... check them out!</Text>

Went for taco Tuesday and it was great! The instructor was awesome, great music and just all over awesome vibes! Younger, older, man or woman either way you will definitely enjoy yourself! I'm a vegetarian so I couldn't eat the tacos but... I heard they were pretty good with a kick and the margaritas too 😉</Text>

I spent my birthday at Joyful Expressions last year and had so much fun that I sent both of my daughters for their birthdays. I really love how entertaining the atomosphere is but what I enjoy most is the stroke by stroke instructions that you get while painting. By the time you are finished you feel like Picasso!! I'm already planning to spend my next event here! Thank you to Joy and the other talented individuals at Joyful Expressions!<//review>

I took my mom and sister for Mother's Day.  We had 2 wings and a waffle with unlimited mimosas.  Joy and her staff were wonderful, very friendly and helpful! Joy made us feel comfortable about painting although none of us had painted before. It was a great experience and I plan to go again. So glad I found Joyful Expressions!<//text>

I was so moved and impressed with my experience at Joyful Expressions Paint Studio. I had the opportunity to tap into my creative side of painting. I realized I have skills. I enjoyed the owner/painter teaching our group how to paint. I was there to celebrate my dear friend my sister in Christ her 50th birthday party. The ambiance of this studio is amazing I had never been to a sip and paint before. I was totally blown away.  It was just awesome and would to do it again. Thank you for asking and God bless.< /review>

<review>It was a nice experience I enjoyed it very friendly environment they just are kind of stingy with the food when you pay a fee of 25+ it shouldn’t be a limit of how many wings you get with your waffles especially if it’s extras if we all paid why are employees eating the extra thought that was unprofessional but I support black businesses so 4 stars ⭐️< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

The last experience I had with Joyful Expressions was JOYUFUL :)  I had a party and I've been to a couple and each time was more than expected, setup was nice and comfy, the Instructors (artist) were great, they were funny with great personalities.  I had an in home party and I've been to their location and both ways turned out really nice.  Don't know anything about painting, no problem, it's more about having fun, enjoying friends and family, and doing something different.  "Have a Paint Party and Have FUN" :)< /review>

Love this place! The staff rocks and the instructor is patient and shares plenty of tips. He makes it seem easy and I'm definitely not am artist. Attended a paint party & we all left with our very own painting. Nice area and plenty of parking in the lot. Staff has your work station and tools ready & waiting. A very positive experience.< /Review>

Joy and her team were on time, personable, knowledgeable and encouraging. She and her assistant guided us as a group, but also one-on-one tips as we experience painting challenges. They brought their own music that help create an atmosphere of togetherness. Joy's analogy for each brush and stroke ability still remains with me today, very useful. I really appreciated that the brushes were in good condition, not overly worn out with stray bristles pointing in different direction which tend to mess up your picture. She had good smooth bristle brushes. I will definitely use the services of Joyful Expression again.< /Review>

This was my first experience. It was wonderful.  I would recommended it to everyone.  You do not need any art experience or background. You will love your art; even in the abstract!  Step out of your comfort zone.  You will not regret it.< /Text>

They're great - especially for group parties. They show you how to paint the picture, but they let you use your own creativity to make it your own, which I liked</Review>

OMG, this is an awesome place to have events. They are very professional and fun all at the same time. I had men at my event and they had a blast too! I would book every week if I could.  I would definitely recommend this place to any and everyone.<//Text>

I went to Joyful Expressions for my best friend's 30th birthday last year and we had hella fun. The other participants were lit and that just added to the experience (lol). I absolutely loved how my painting came out. I am no artist, but with the guidance of the instructors (I wish I remembered their names) my painting came out bomb!<//Review>

I went to a birthday party and sipped,  ate and painted all I  one night!  The hostess Jaye, and her assistant Danielle,  were playful,  and a delight to paint with.   I will definitely return.   (Mostly to support this African American business)<//review>

Such an awesome experience. I spent my 30th birthday here. Initially I was going to have a private party but ended up canceling it so I did a bottomless brunch paint day instead. Setting up the private party and canceling it was very easy to do. The bottles brunch was $45 and worth every penny. You got two sizeable pieces of chicken and a big ole waffle and bottomless mimosas. They are not skimpy or stingy with the mimosas. Most people had between two and three because honestly, you came to paint not get drunk. The instruction is easy to follow, there's tons of laughter and it's a super safe space to be a black woman, though all are welcome. I will come back again and again. I'm in love with my painting and am still shocked by how great it turned out. I can't recommend it enough.< /Text>

Love Love Love!! This was my first time at Joyfull Expressions and it definitely won’t be my last! My friend and her husband invited myself and my husband ( who btw had a stroke in February 2018),... he was told to work on his “fine motor” skills and this was perfect! He has never done anything remotely close to painting ever and I might say so myself that with the instructor guidance, good vibes and great music he did an awesome job!! I’m very happy we went and hopefully will be able to do a private party for our friends ( they do those too)!!! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!< /text>

This was the second time I've used Joyful Expressions and they did not disappoint! The team that came to my home was very friendly, patient, and sociable. They were able to keep everyone on track and our pictures turned out great. The ease to book the party was great, and I had a couple changes that they fully accomodated. Very friendly staff. I'll definitely use them again!<//Text>

It was a fun time.  I enjoyed the leaders commentary.  It was a relaxed and not stressful time.  My guest enjoyed them selves.  Looking for a reason to do it again.</review>

Me and two girlfriend came to celebrate  a birthday.   We had a ball, stroking with Big Daddy(private  joke you have to come to a class to find out), the music  was on time and Joy was a fantastic instructor.   She  instructed  us all the way with our painting.  I plan to go again real soon.< /Review>

I have also attended a thirsty Thursday a few months ago, and i plan to go again next week. its relaxing and My favorite artist are Joy and Liz.... and lets not forget about the bomb Playlist of music that's on while were painting...

<text>A great paint studio. I have been here 3 times once was a private party. They are very welcoming and helpful. Most nights you can bring your own food and snacks. I have also been to several Paintnite sessions at other places. The atmosphere is more laidback and supportive than Paintnite.< /text><Name>Chandalyn Jones<//Name><resp>{'time': 1504284380933, 'text': 'Hi Chandalyn! Thank you for your time and review!
