<rating>5<//rating><Review>I adore this place.  I’ve been to several dentists and the ones I’ve been to are okay, but everyone here (all the staff) they’re knowledgeable, they answer all your questions, they make you feel like you’re questions are important and they want to make sure that you feel comfortable and they go above and beyond.  I particularly say thank you to Dr. Davani and Rosie!  You guys rock!💕</Review>< pictures>

<review>The ladies at the front office were very nice and made me feel welcomed as a new patient. The office itself is a little on the older side and looks a little worn out. The dentist was ok. The reason I didn’t go back was because they didn’t do my filling correctly and my bite wasn’t leveled out. My bf also had a bad experience with the same dentist. He was told he needed braces (his smile is perfect) and his filling was done poorly and when he tried to get it fixed the dentist told him he would need a root canal (without doing any X-rays).< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< user>

I had such a wonderful experience at Avalon Dental Care I have been telling everyone about them.  I was taken in at my appointment time.  The dentist was very nice.  I have some messed up teeth but never felt judged.  Linda in the front office was very nice and helpful.  She has a lot of knowledge.  I'm going to book my daughters appointment and my dad's.  Very professional, very clean and both front and back office staff were friendly.< /Review>

<Text>Excellent! The best experience at the dental office I have ever had was at Avalon. From making appointments to get my implant. Doctor Marjan Kelishadi is very knowledgeable and professional.  She is a really good surgeon. I had lost lots of bones in my jaw.
She grafted bones in order to do implant a few months ago. She extracted my tooth.
She did an implant.I didn't have any pain and just had a pain killer the day after the surgery.
She also did  crowns for me. All she did was
Great work. Her staff are friendly and her office is very clean and up to date.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I've always been very afraid of the dentist, but I am having a change of heart.. buy only at this dental office😁. Awesome dental office!<//Review>< user_name>

The front desk staff (Linda & Rosie) and the team members who assists the doctors provides such excellent customer service and will definitely make you feel very welcome and comfortable. I had my wisdom teeth removed by the doctor and her assistant in year 2015. They both were great and did an amazing job. Just recently (7/2/18), I had a deep cleaning done by this wonderful, amazing, and super kind woman name, “Eman.” During the procedure, she was very patient and caring. She waited and made sure I was completely comfortable enough prior to starting the procedure. Eman did a terrific job and would HIGHLY recommend her for deep and regular cleanings. I left the clinic feeling satisfied and happy (: Over all, I would definitely recommend this place.<//Text>< pics>

I’ve been going to Avalon Dental Care for about three years for occasional checkups and a few surgeries. For those three years, it’s been nothing but excellent service! Walking in, I feel comfortable. Leaving, I walk away with a smile on my face. I don’t believe there is any dental office quite like them.< /review>

I love have a cup of tea in the morning time. However, a couple years back, I was having as much as 5 cups per day. I was warned it would begin staining my teeth but that didn’t persuade me. But, guess what? It happened! Luckily, I didn’t have to live with my stained teeth for long. I made an appointment at Avalon and my dentist ensure that my teeth were white once again. I’ve slowed down on my tea intake but thought the ordeal, I found a trustworthy dentist.</Text>

First visit : I was able to see how patient and professional the staff carried themselves. Very friendly and explained everything thoroughly

Second visit : same thing and also a clean dental office is a plus

Third visit : I had to get my crown done  scary right?! Not so much, especially after the horrible experience I had with a previous dental office, this was a breeze! Dr was awesome made my fears come to an end did the job with her amazing dental assistant! Then the finale!!!! Linda the receptionist SOOOO funny and sweet, had me laughing even with a numb mouth lol I really enjoyed conversing with the staff and the overall visit!

Totally recommend this office with more than two thumbs up<//Text>

<review>How much fun can having a tooth extracted be?

I was in pain and the Avalon Dental staff told be to come in same day. Said there could be a wait as they were fully booked, and I did not care. Less than 5 minutes after I arrived I was called in.  Dr Davani diagnosed the problem quickly and gave me the option to do an extraction today, which turned out to be 15 minutes later.

Extraction of molar not fun, but Dr Davani  is very capable and experienced. While it seemed like forever while it was happening, it actually was over quite quickly and two days later, pain relief was immediate and I have experience only slight discomfort from procedure as I recover.

Have already decided to try to get back on track with regular check-ups and have scheduled a visit for early June.< /review>< user_name>

As an adult, I never contemplated the possibility of having to get braces. Sadly, the thought had to cross my mind when I was told I needed them. But the bright side to all of this was that Dr. Kelishadi was my dentist and I knew that it was going to be a good experience. I now have braces for about a year more, but there have been no complications thanks to Dr. Kelishadi.</Review>

My son needed braces but he was afraid people would make fun of him. He refused to get normal braces. At Avalon Dental Care, the dentist suggested Invisalign. With Invisalign, my son finds that it is easier to clean than regular braces. Also, he can eat whatever he wants. We are grateful for the suggestion from the dentist, and my son loves that there is a way to straighten his teeth clear and easy.< /review>

<Text>I know of nowhere else that I can get great dental care from that Avalon Dental Care. For the past 4 years, I’ve been going to them for checkups and a few dental works. And for 4 year, I have been extremely happy with the service I received from the moment I set foot in the first door.<//Text>< Response>

I’ve been a patient at Avalon dental going on 7 years and I couldn’t go anywhere else! I love the amazing staff. Lidia and Rosie make me feel like I’m at home when I come in for appointments. Deb and lupe make sure I’m settled in and comfortable before I see the doctor. Iman is the best hygienist and never fails to keep my mouth clean. Last not but least, I’ve had both Invisalign and braces treatment with Dr. Davani and Dr. Cao and they both are attentive and informative with any questions or concerns I have with my teeth. This place makes me love going to the dentist to get my routine check ups and cleanings! They’re like family to me and will continue to make me feel good and smile showing off my beautiful teeth!< /Text>

AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE!

I had Medi-Cal and had to forgo my dentist of years to get a check up here. It turned out that I needed fillings so I had no other choice but to get them done here. That was the biggest mistake ever!

Now that I have better insurance and was able to go back to my original dentist, she explained that, from looking at my x-rays (taken at Avalon Dental Care, no less),  whoever had filled my cavities left residual decay which was causing the extreme sensitivity I was feeling.

It has been TWO YEARS since coming to Avalon Dental Care and their dentist said it was normal to feel sensitivity after having cavities filled, but going from no sensitivity before the procedure to painful sensitivity after didn't seem normal. Now I know my dental work was not done properly and will have to get ALL my fillings redone due to Avalon Dental Care's dentist's lack of care.

Don't go here! Save yourself the pain and suffering and do your research to find a better option for dental care.<//text>

Had a terrible time getting any assistance, they had to page someone for garden 3 times to finally get someone.  The store was empty when I went so I don't understand the lack of service.</Text>

Absolute best meat for quite a few miles. This meat is not cheap but it's well worth it. If you really want to treat yourself go here. Seriously the meat is so high quality. What's really awesome too is that you can get hamburgers from here and they cook them on site, and they are to die for!< /text>

Best burger I’ve ever had hands down (I’ve tried all of the best burger spots in town). Hopefully a side option like fries will be added soon! 5 stars</Review>< date>

<text>Coming here and complaining about the price  of food is like going to Rodeo Drive and complaining about the price of clothes. There are plenty of other places to go get food. BUT if you want THE BEST meat money can buy then you shop here and you know exactly why. Go educate yourself and live within your means. I know this will be MY chop shop as long as they bring that heat they are already KNOWN for.</text>< pictures>

Best burger/steak options in San Diego hands down. Really refreshing to see restaurants like swaygu pop up and take things seriously.

Best burger I’ve ever had hands down (I’ve tried all of the best burger spots in town). Hopefully a side option like fries will be added soon! 5 stars<//text>

Great place for an $18 burger. Just heads up it's pretty small, so be prepared to eat in your car or just order pick up. Although there is I believe 2 small tables outside.< /Review>

I have to honestly say, if it isn’t a steak from @swagyuchopshop, I DON’T WANT IT. This honestly was the most amazing experience i have ever had the pleasure of having and sharing amongst my family!Thank you so much 🙏🏼
Not just that but my coworker bought us some of the wagyu burgers and they were amazing! The potatoes were absolutely incredible as well! Thank you @swagyuchopshop 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼</Review>

<Text>We were so excited to try this place out when we found out they had opened in Imperial Beach. Everything they had to offer looked amazing and we were incredibly pleased with the cut we ended up purchasing. They have cuts at all different price points and even thier affordable cuts don't compromise in quality. So there is really something for everyone here. We knew the product would impress us as soon as we layed eyes on it, but the real surprise for us was the staff. They were so knowledgeable, friendly and you could tell they were genuinly enthusiastic and passionate about thier product. A true hallmark of a quality business. New meat dealer in town, 10/10. 👌<//Text>< pics>

Yesterday at 12:18pm we went to check out this new shop. Online it says that they open at 12 but the door was locked when we tried to open it. Two men were talking behind the counter, saw us and ignored us. We left feeling very disappointed. Probably wouldn’t try going in again due to this negative experience.</Review>

I'm another happy customer!  I've used Security Public Storage for months as I travel for professional reasons. The staff were super-friendly when I signed up. The facility is clean and appears to be well protected. The staff helped me move to a smaller unit when my needs changed. Billing is simple.

I would 100% recommend them to anyone. They're a class act.

tldr: very professional, safe, good people, good price< /review>

<Review>I would recommend this storage facility. I got a great online rate. When I went in to sign paperwork the lady in the office was knowledgable and able to help get me in and out quickly. The prices are lower than most. The grounds are kept clean. I like the added security they have. I feel confident my belongings will be kept safe. If you need a storage unit I recommend Security Public Storage.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

This self storage Security Public Storage at Sonoma Blvd. in Vallejo is amazing. They have excellent service, they have reasonable rates, the storage units are well kept and clean, the hours of operation are reasonable also. I go there every year to store my son's stuff from Cal Maritime Academy, for the summer, and I know I can trust their services. I give them a 5- rating. - Cherry C.<//text>

Security Public Storage is the best place to keep your personal belongings in Vallejo!

They recently installed much sturdier doors which in turn gives their patrons a greater feeling of safety and security.

Their customer reps are always friendly and go out of their way to assist those in need.

In addition to that, any customer who checks in on YELP! receives a free gift--what more can anybody asks?

I highly recommend Security Public Storage for all your storage needs, their combination of reasonable monthly rates, security, and excellent customer service is the best in the Vallejo/American Canyon/Benicia areas hands down!

Thank You Security Public Storage for your outstanding customer service!< /Text>

Alicia was very nice and professional. The rates are good and the facility itself is very clean. Glad i chose here to store my belongings. Someone on site 24 hrs and alarms on each unit makes me feel better about the security of my things.< /review>

Wonderful customer service, can not recommend enough! Alicia has always been helpful and accommodating and made me confident that my unit is safe with their top security features. Since she is the onsite manager she has assured me that the locks and cameras are always attended to.

I had plenty of information on choosing the right unit for me at the best price. Alicia had no problem walking me through online payments and figuring out how to do auto payments. I tend to have a lot of questions and she took the time to answer any that I had.</text>

Our experience has been great.  I live out of town now, but they are really responsive and helpful by email or on the phone, including making phone payments easy.  Paying online is also a snap.  But they also provide great customer service in person and are friendly and helpful.  Convenient location on Sonoma Blvd, too!< /Review>

<Text>Security Public Storage in Vallejo has been excellent. Prices are affordable and the property is always clean. But you have to give credit to the two women who run this place. Lana and Linda add the personal touch. No matter the reason I called them for, I always get a response or even a call back. But it's totally cool that they treat you as a person and not just a customer.< /Text>< pics>

<text>Here at secure public storage I have had a very good experience with the management. The process to rent was quick and easy, there are different ways to get helpful discounts all the time plus its really easy to get to right off the freeway. I usually grab some food in the parking lot before going to wrangle my unit that I have turned into a custom closet! What makes it even cooler is that the managers are on the website and the youtube!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I have been here at security public storage for 1 month now. I got 3 months @ 25% off for my discounted rate on my unit. Alicia helped me out with getting me all signed up and ready to go in no time at all. She was very pleasant to speak to. Each unit has it's own unique entry password. So if your jnit gets opened without your access code to the gate the alarm will be triggered to go off.  The only reason I dont give this storage location a 5 star rating is  based on their hours. I originally thought they had 24 hour access into the yard and found out soon gaining my unit that the gates actually close at 7 and the office closes at 6. That was a bummer to me,because I work at all hours of the night and am existed in the mornings and dint really got much time before I go back into work to stop by my unit, but I can work it out. During this first month here I can say every person I've met and seen working have been a great individual and if I had any questions they were quick on responding to my needs. Thank you security public storage!< /text>

<Text>I like Security Public Storage because their staff is friendly, they have reasonable rates, it’s clean and I like their security features.
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they close too early and   I work in the city and by the time I get there, the place is closed.  Other than that, I like it overall.   :-)</Text>< pictures>

We just rented the unit end of Sept and so far so good.  It was the first one we checked out and was happy with what they offer.  Price is reasonable and very friendly.  Customer service is good so far and no hidden fees.  I like the idea that they give you opportunities to get a discount and that insurance is included.  Hope the relationship will stay good if not better.< /Review>

In general my experience at storage places is that the people there are just clocking hours, but both folks I've done business with (Lynda and Lana) have been very professional and friendly.  They both take the work seriously and are nice to talk to.  Lana stopped by during my move-in to check on me and see if everything was OK.  The price is good.

Security Public Storage is a very good place to store your personal belongings. It's safe, it's secure, and they guarantee peace of mind. The staff there are wonderful and friendly people. They are helpful and show much concern when it comes to your most valuable belongings that you just can't keep at home. Their prices are very fair for the space they offer. In other words, you get your money's worth.<//Text>

I see people there and it's not "suspect", which is great in comparison to some of the other local storage options. The ladies are always friendly, and I knew exactly what to expect.

They take all kinds of payments. My father has been a customer here for over a year and we've never had problems. Whenever we have questions or concerns they always answer - there is never a stupid question to ask them. If something goes wrong they call you as soon as they know - they don't wait for you to come in and then tell you there was an incident. The security is great because each member has their own code which is needed to get in and out - if you have multiple storages you need to enter both codes if you will be visiting both containers otherwise the police are called.< /Text>< Pictures>

Very safe storage unit location that has never had a break-in according to the staff.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and processed my unit quickly.

The location is VERY clean and the rates competitive.

Been here for 14 years, management is the best. Always have a smile on their face and willing to to help.  I would recommend if you are in need of a storage check out these people you won't regret it.  Security is number 1 with them.< /Text>

I have had a storage unit here at SPS for around 12 years. In that time I have never had a break-in or any type of tampering with my unit. The security is very good. But even though I need not worry about my things, the real reason I keep the unit is the customer service. I am always welcome in the office. The ladies always have a smile and wonderful attitude. They are always ready to answer any questions I have. They are helpful and give me opportunities to lower my payments through special offers. I have never had such a positive experience with storage. Thanks and keep up the good work.</text>

<Review>I have rented from Security Public Storage in Vallejo on and off for the last 25 years. Lana has assisted me every time and she provides the greatest customer service.  The premises are well secured with alarms and video survellience. If any suspicious activity is detected, they are quick to call you and notify you.  The grounds and the units are very clean and well kept.  I've never had rodents or weather damage to any property stored.  If you're looking for a secure, safe storage facility with a very caring, attentive to detail and courteous staff, please see them first.  The site always advertises great discounts so check it out.<//Review>< Rate>

<review>DISABLED-Pressure is all I felt with u-haul rental fees insurance gas paid help ON A FIXED INCOME AIN'T EASY.. CALLING AROUND SEARCHING FOR GOOD SAFE CONVENIENT STORAGE UNIT WAS ABSOLUTELY NO TASK AT ALL WITH SECURITY PUBLIC STORAGE. ABSOLUTELY THE BEST RATES, THE  MOST BEST STAFF I'VE EVER INCOUNTERED. LANA & LINDA ARE TRULY ARE AN ASSET TO THE COMPANY. THEY ANSWERED EVERY QUESTION CORRECTLY AN THOROUGHLY. PAPERWORK A LIL ON THE HEAVY SIDE BUT OVERALL THE PRORATED RENT WAS DEFINITELY EXCEPTABLE. CLEAN UNIT/GROUNDS EXCELLENT STAFF, REASONABLE RATES ON UNITS AND SUPPLIES. HAPPY NEW YEARS TOO BOTH YOU WONDERFUL LADIES. IF THEY EVER MAKE A REALITY SHOW FOR DISABLED GONE WILD I'LL LEAD THE PACT JUST SO ME AND MY WHEELCHAIR DON'T RUN OVER ANYBODY. THANKS LINDA/THANKS LANA. GOD BLESS</review>< Pictures>

{'time': 1458756813172, 'text': "Edward Paolo isn't really your name, is it? You've been trolling this tired narrative all over the place and been called out on it a few times now. Our rate increases over the last few years have averaged about 5% a yea,r which is actually below market for the extraordinarily high rental rates in this area. The most recent increase is .  because of very high demand and limited availability in our market. Unlike our big corporate competitors, we don’t automatically adjust rates by pricing software designed to obtain the very highest rate the market will bear. Instead at SPS we carefully shop our competitors, relative to our own inventory, and only raise rates to the degree that we need to respond to market demand or the increased cost of doing business (increased minimum wage, property taxes, etc.)  And nobody smokes in the office - as you point out, that is illegal in California."}<//Response>

DO NOT RENT HERE!!!!! If you like rent increases every few months, cigarette smoke, racism then this place is for you.

This place will hook you in with a great price and increase it, and increase it, and increase it.

Oh and they do smoke in the office, some other person must of quit, but someone is still smoking in the office, which is illegal in the state of California, and just plain unprofessional.

Don't rent here! You have plenty of other choices. I know the price seems great, but it will go up. Guaranteed.< /Text>

Everything from my childhood and my sons childhood is gone. I refused to pay for the unit simply because they said there was nothing they could do which i dont see how because i paid for insurance on the unit. I asked them for the insurance companies information and they told me that they did not know. Now the unit is being charged to my credit because i refused to pay for a unit that was dismembered by mice no one told me they had a mice problem and they couldn't even provide me the insurance companies information on how to go about being compensated for my unit belongings being ruined. Customer Service is OK but how they handled my problem was unacceptable. DO NOT RENT HERE.<//Review>< pictures>

< review>
Well the day I rolled into this location with a truck full of stuff I was on the brink of exhaustion and despair. I had spent all of my money on the truck, movers, supplies etc and my account was ZAPPPPPPPPPED I was cursing the Gods.. the nice lady I can't remember her name to save my life actually saved my life.. She trotted me around the grounds on the golf cart to find the best size unit for the best price and she even honored a discount that wasn't for the unit I got.

If it wasn't for Security Storage this day I would have been scrambled eggs for sure..and they even helped me with the log on process for online..
Sor Far so Good. I'm grateful and satisified..<//review>

(Translated by Google) I recommend this storage, the manager is very friendly and always available to help. The property is safe and clean. Here I feel confident that everything is protected. Thanks Alicia for all the help.

(Translated by Google) I like to rent for the security and what is very clean. And that they have the manager living in the property for more security.

Avoid at all costs.  I recently rented from this location and received damaged equipment that was dirty and in need of services (according to dashboard computer).  Upon return I was accused of damaging the equipment.  I reported my concerns prior and post rental to the location staff, but was rudely blown off.  Now I am disputing ~$2k charges despite purchasing additional coverage.</Review>

Came for a propane refill on 12/5/20 at around 1pm. I was told to wait by the tank and Chad would be right there. Waited 20 min. and nothing. Female in charge was terrible. I ended up walking away and doing business elsewhere.
Also, if you rent trucks here make sure to take pics of everything. They tried to charge me for half a tank of gas. Luckily I had photo proof of the gas gauge.<//review>

Had to update my review. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a refund to my bank account. The process was a bit frustrating, but next time instead of just dropping off, I will  ask for receipt and/or name of employee to confirm no extra charges. 🙂

Do not use this location!! Overcharging customers with no clear reason as to why?! We had U-Haul for approximately 7 hrs, and we we’re charged an additional fee. Will be reporting to BBB.</text>

<Text>Always keeping up with demand. Due to the verifying credentials slows the issuing the process.. however the entire team members are on top of it.
Austin keep your customer relations up. They really enjoy your presence.

Dropped it off on Tuesday 4pm (Uhaul employee detached it and took care about paperwork), next day I got receipt by email, that I dropped it off on Wednesday 8am and was charged for 1 day extra $43! What the hell?! I emailed them - got no response. When I called the office, they told me I’ll get my refund for that 1 day extra in 3 days, I said “Thank You!” and their response was “Ahmm” and  no “sorry for that” or something else like that... Like nothing happened. Not mentioning that trailer was dirty and in terrible condition with wholes and broken planks inside, fixed with zip ties, which also make the small holes for straps even smaller (through these holes you tie down your stuff with straps).<//review>< pics>

I tried calling to figure it out and they didn’t answer so I ended up call U-Haul customer service and they didn’t answer the customer service rep either. They left a message for them and I haven’t heard back so I’m assuming they found the key. ? I could’ve gone without the rude message or at least got a call back apologizing when it was found.</Text>< pictures>

<Text>So apparently yesterday someone went to this location and fraudulently spent $104.24 there. I have never stepped foot in this U-Hual a day in my life. So when i am asking questions the representative was like "we we need your number to look it up to see the name used you need to contact your bank" IM TELLING YOU THAT SOMEONE STOLE MY CREDIT CARD INFORMATION TO AT YOUR COMPANY AND ALL YOU'RE TELLING ME TO DO IS TO SHUT MY CARD DOWN?? DO YOU NOT HAVE POLICIES FOR THIS NOT EVEN POLICIES BUT COMPASSION?? THIS IS A JOKE< /Text>< Pictures>

If I could give minus stars I would. I have been in line 30 min and it has not moved. There are 3 counters open. 2 lines. No indication which line I’m supposed to be in. I did the online  checkin when I made the reservation but doesn’t seem to make a difference. I’m in the same slow line. This is an awful experience. Meanwhile the clock is ticking and my move has not started. Hope I get it done in time! Awful awful. If you have a choice, go rent from a different location that has less activity - find one out of Long Beach. This is ridiculous. The guys working seem nice but whoever their boss is put them in a bad position to have to deal with this volume so short staffed. Shame on the owners for having such a poorly run operation. Awful.</Review>

This move was very stressful and on top of that it rained the whole time,  some of my things got wet, but my pick up wasn't from this location. On my drop off return, Yvonne took good care of me when I returned the truck. Again excellent Customer service and she and her staff are very pleasant folks. I was thankful when all was said and done. I will most definitely refer family and friends to this location.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>Horrible experience with this location!  We went in person 2 days before our pick-up day to check that everything was good to go, and even received a call from them confirming the day before.  Well, when we went to pick up our truck using mobile pick up before they opened, our truck wasn't ready and the owner, who had given us his cell #, didn't answer texts/calls and we were stuck having to call a national U-haul # to get a truck.  They changed our rental to the Cherry Ave. location for 9am.  They gave us $50 back, but U-haul of Long Beach set our move 2 hours behind.    It messed up our entire day!  For a long-distance move like ours, do not use U-haul.  What a hassle it was working with them!!!<//review><Date>1537219988931</Date>< GmapID>

They didn't bother to tell us to bring it back to the same location. I thought we could drop off @ any location. Therefore I had to pay them extra.I will not recommend this company nor use them. I would suggest to use them with caution and ask questions  cause they don't care about customers service.< /Text>

My goto branch for moving. Trucks are in a very good shape, moving supplies are cheaper if you need individual 1-2 two boxes. Cameron and Kevin are super helpful guys. If you are in Long Beach and need to rent a truck or moving supplies i highly highly suggest this branch.< /Review>

It took well over an hour of phone calls and waiting to contest the milage disparity, for which no compensation was offered. If one has to do business with this location I highly recommend double checking everything before signing anything to avoid such hassles. If you are a trusting person, buyer beware! It will make no difference to your wallet if this kind of problem was a mistake on their part, if you value your time and money, consider going elsewhere.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Living in the city, I don't have anywhere to park a trailer, so any time I have an event I need to race I rent one from this Uhaul location to transport my race car.  I rent about once a month.  Staff is always cool and easy going - good people.< /Text>

Waited a very long time because it was a Friday and there was only 1 cashier. The line kept growing and finally another cashier came in. They should be prepared on Fridays and at the end of the month for heavier traffic in the store.< /Text>

Always have a good experience renting vans/trucks from them.  Can be busy at times but customer service is always good.< /text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>I am Extremely disappointed & disgusted with manager Yvonne Crawford as I’ve never experienced anything like this situation to be so mischievous and premeditated.
Rented a truck from 1600 Pacific Coast Hwy., Long Beach, CA 90806 on 03/21/17 @ 3: 24 pm.  After signing the contract Manager, Yvonne Crawford, asked my brother-in-law and I to check the truck for any bumps/scratches around the truck. We both checked the truck and signaled some scratches and bumps on the body around the truck box.  Ms. Crawford never offered us to open the truck box for it to check the inside. The funny thing is that when we were loading our furniture, I noticed the opening on the corner of the truck but didn’t think anything about it.
Upon returning to the store, my brother-in-law pulled into the store to park the truck, Ms. Crawford came quickly out of the store and said: “You are going to pay for the damage on the truck.”  Her second remark was “as soon as you pulled up, I noticed the damage on the top corner.”  My question is? How did she know the truck was damaged if she had not yet inspected it?  All I can say is that this is a very organized scam and an easy way for this lady to make extra money.
We both were astounded and upheld our innocence as we told her that the damage was previously there.  Ms. Crawford said, “I am who gave you the truck and I know since I inspect it.”
We were both in a hurry as my brother-in-law is a Pastor so he needed to head to church.  As we try to reason with Ms. Crawford that the damage was previously there she totally ignores us and continued accusing us that we had caused the damage.
When I mentioned that I had purchase the insurance Ms. Crawford stated: “the insurance only covers the body of the truck not the top or the roof.” Ms. Crawford was perfectly aware of how she was going to get us to pay for the damage.  Even though I paid for the insurance, Ms. Crawford still charged me for the damage.
This situation is unfair as Ms. Crawford premeditated who her next innocent victim would be;  unfortunately, in this case, Sandra Carpio, paid the price of her easy money making scam.
I had previously rented trucks from this facility but believe me, I will never use UHaul services again as this experience has left a sower taste in my mouth.
I will file a consumer report, tell my family and friends and write yelp reviews about this matter. I am glad it happens to me as I will not keep quiet about this situation.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

The woman behind the counter has always taken care of me. I accidentally forgot to bring back the dolly for about a week and they were really cool about it and didn't charge me.<//review>

<review>I had an appointment at 7am to get a hitch put on my car and was pre-paid.  By 830 am I was still waiting and was told they will get to me after they help all the other customers that keep coming in.  When I talked to the manager Gabriel hernandez he had no respect for me and could care less how long I had been waiting and how much longer I would have to wait.  Having an appointment meant nothing to them and they don't deserve any buisness.< /review>< pics>

<review>This U-Haul station is a blight on this neighborhood. It's turned into a hang out for vagrants. It is not discouraged by management. You can't walk to the front door without being harassed by someone, who is not a paying customer. And quite frankly, I am tired of it.</review><GmapID>0x80dd31653c12536f:0xaf66f085d8200a5< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I love this place, as a former long-term employee(5-10-18 to 5/2019 (I think the year's are right)) I can honestly say that William is a very loving and compassionate man, he's family oriented and is very positive, even when things are stressful and difficult, he keeps a smile on his face and gets what needs to be done, done. He was an amazing person to work for/with, he taught me a lot and gave me a chance to work at Rooster Wheels when I was homeless living in a van with my girlfriend at the time and our two dogs which William loved too, Breezy he says is a bunny, he really did more then a boss/coworker would ever have in any other situation, he became a really close friend of mine over the year I had been working there until my girlfriend broke up with me and I left, and quit working there, we still keep in touch from here and there, I hope this review helps some people understand that this place is simply amazing in every aspect thanks to William and his strength and will to be able to do what he does.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<time>1531963312802<//time><rating>5</rating><text>Amazing experience here. I brought my family of 6 in to rent bikes for the day. William took the time to outfit each of my kids (ages 4-12) with a bike that they liked. My wife and I both got cruisers.

The beach bike trail was right across the street, so we left our car there and spent the afternoon riding along the coast. Everyone had a great time.

When we returned, I liked my rental so much, that I asked William if I could buy it. He gave me a good price and  replaced the grips. I couldn't be happier with our experience there. I would recommend Rooster Wheels to anyone; large-familied or not!< /text>< Pics>

If your are looking for a bike shop in the Monterey Bay area Roosters should be your only stop. William and his crew are the most knowledgeable and professional in the business. They do not look down or shorthand anyone that comes into the shop. Every time I come in I know that I will be getting personal service that you cannot get anywhere else, no matter what they have him the extra mile to help me and I am sure they will do the same for anyone else. 10/10<//Text>

<Time>1578159285498< /Time><text>Not a bad shop at all. Repairs are solid and the price is decent but turn around time is pretty long. I have had repairs done 3 times now at this shop and it has been over two week each time. In addition, I called to check on the status of the repairs each time the bike was in the shop and told I would be called back which I wasn't.

On the plus side, the owner of the shop is extremely nice and knowledgable.

Overall, if you don't need your bike for a few weeks, this is the shop for repairs and service done at a good price. If you want a quick turn around time, I would go elsewhere.<//text>< user_id>

This man William in accordance with the law and having stricken social distancing rules stayed open to help poor guys like myself get some exercise and help with part s. When I pulled my wallet out his words were we are all good man. I can't say enough about that guy and his shop and if I don't break my neck on this recycled bicycle then my next bike I am buying from him. Thanks William.<//Text>

I took my bike here for repair on 1/20/20 it is now july and the owner William cannot find my bike. They actually offered me a different bike! This place is a rats nest of disorganization and clutter.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this bicycle chop shop.  Police Report Made. Its too bad there isnt a negative star rating.< /Review>

2 months and nothing done. Defeats the purpose to bring your bike here for repairs. Collected my bike back and it was even more rusted then when I dropped it off to be fixed up.< /review>

<text>Roosters Wheels is one of those places that feels like a village shop. Real people with real connection. I've been a big fan since we first discovered them.

<text>The day I brought my bike to his shop, I called a few times each time he told me it could be done the next day. Almost two weeks later I called and he was kinda rude to me and told me he would call me when it was done. I waited another day and just drove up there. To his defense hes really busy. I would just like from the start to for him to say it may take two weeks or more instead being put on hold and given the run around. If you don't mind your bike being in the shop for 2 weeks plus this is the for you. If your in a hurry I don't suggest this shop.</text><Response>None</Response><UserId.>104621047470698724094</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

William the owner is someone you would like to have your children grow up to be like him. Honest, friendly, hardworking, and fun to know! We arrive at the store and he came out of the store to ask if we needed help as I exited my vehicle. He removed my rear bike tire, checked for leaks, replace a tube, sold me a air pump, and of course with a great price. He offer information on local trails and his phone number if I need help on the bike or off. Wow - he got my business and future loyalty.< /text>

A fantastic local bike shop. Everyone I've spoken with there has been super nice and patient and welcoming. It's exactly the environment you want in a local shop. Nice, chatty and patient people who love bikes and love to share that love. Marina is such a great town.

Anyways, I took my bike in for a tune up, and it has never rode better than after the tune. Took only one day!  It was also quite a bit less expensive than I expected, but I think my expectations were high. Regardless, the price is very fair. I would definitely trust any bike to this shop  - good people, great service. I almost want to have more work done just to hang out at the shop!<//text>

<Text>This was a phenomenal place to rent bikes for the day! William spent time making sure each bike was right for each person, and the cost was very reasonable.

<text>Wow, where to begin? The owner, William, took exceptional care of me and my wife with rental bikes. He went out of his way when we showed up to custom fit some road bikes to us, even switching out pedals and a bikes to us, even switching out pedals and a stem! I would highly recommend rooster Wheels to anyone in the area, not only for rental bikes but also sales and service!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< date>

< Review>
I rarely write positive reviews because quite frankly it’s seldom that I’m wowed by a customer service experience.  I needed the front break on my bike fixed and both of my tires were worn so I actually considered buying a new bike.  Instead I took my bike to Rooster Wheels in Marina with the goal of just getting the break fixed. The proprietor (William) was super friendly and indicated he could fix the break on the spot. He commented on the tires and I elected to leave the bike there for him to install new ones (tubes and tires). Less than 2 hours later he calls and tells me my bike is ready.  A break fixed, two new tires, prompt and friendly service -- $25. Wow, what a bargain!< /Review>

< Review>
I'm actually really sad to hear that they will be renovating this place and making it exclusive. I'm really fortunate to have visited this hotel in its current incarnation. I would have liked to visit again on my next trip to LA. The room itself was literally bigger than my apartment! We really loved the layout. The decor was really nice and the ambience was really cool. The service was really good. One staff member even let us see the library (which was closed at the time) before we left since we missed getting in the night before. I would have loved to explore the hotel a little more. The only reason I am giving 5 stars is their website states they have a car service within 3 miles of the hotel, which was a really strong amenity to get me to book the place, but when we got there, the car service was not available so we wound up getting Lyft rides mostly. All in all it seems like a really cool place and I'll be sad to have to find a new hotel next time I am in town.</Review>

Unique, trendy hotel. Staff seemed inexperienced as far as hospitality industry goes. Stayed on a Thursday night, which is essentially the new Friday night for many people these days. The bar and restaurant were closed by 11pm. The front desk said that the hotel offered 24 hour room service, either from their own facilities or from local delivery service like door dash or eat24. However, when we called at 12:30, no one answered. Anywhere. Not even the front desk. I loved the room- the layout, decor, location. We would have planned for other dining options had we known there were none available.<//Text>

Everybody could not have been nicer and more considerate. Breakfast was perfect, room service even in the middle of the night was right there. And car service was a real plus plus. Will be back for sure!< /Review></record>

<review>The location is nice, just right off Hollywood and Vine. The hotel itself is very quaint and had a nice boutique feel to it in a very big city. The building was originally built to be condos so the hotel rooms are very spacious with an open floor plan that includes a full kitchen. If you stay here, don't get an interior room overlooking the library patio. The view is nice but the soundproof windows/balcony door does not work. The live band and DJ kept me up past midnight and I had to be up at 5:00 the next morning. Other than that, everything was great, including the restaurant downstairs (solid cocktails).< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

The room was gorgeous. When you walk in you get the Hollywood sign vibe. They have a display of several alcoholic beverages for purchase they also have baskets of goodies to eat. The location is amazing as well as an amazing view of Capitol Records building, Hollywood sign, and Hollywood and Vine. You Walked Out Of the front door and already see stars from the Walk of Fame. Across the street amazing place called Pie Hole.</text>

Great hotel rooms! Like staying in a nice condo, they even have kitchens! I stayed a week and it definitely felt like home within the first hour. I was able to save some money by cooking a couple meals and the staff was ultra friendly.</text>

We had a office holiday party in the Library room.  It was nicely decorated and has an intimate setting.  You can also go outside to the common area.  The food was delicious and catered by the restaurant downstairs.  Wish they had left the food out longer so we could have more.</Text>

<Review>I haven't stayed in a lot of hotels out here in LA, but The Redbury is probably one of my favorite hotels! I stay here with friends whenever I'm in town and I have friends playing the venue next door. The rooms are huge, providing a little kitchen and living space area which is great for hanging out and allowing you to feel comfortable while you're there. It's a great location and is located around a lot of awesome restaurants and you can take a stroll down Hollywood blvd. it's got old Hollywood decor and has a boutique feel.

Definitely not the cheapest hotel you're going to find, but it's worth a visit and stay, or even just a trip to the library bar located in the hotel.< /Review>< pics>

Had dinner for four at Cleo restaurant in the Redbury Hollywood. Service was 5 Star! The décor was astounding, which made for a very elegant ambiance, though the space can get inaudibly loud at times. The food was a delicious variety of Mediterranean dishes: however, every serving was the size of a small appetizer, and the prices are a bit steep considering. Good for a tasteful outing, avoid if in search of a hearty meal.</Text>

<review>Fun and Hip the Redbury gives you all your Hollywood dreams in one place. The multiple bars serve a great selection of drinks in a cool, upscale setting.

<rating>5<//rating><Review>The hotel is centrally located within walking distance to many restaurants, nightclubs, bars, and other popular Hollywood attractions. During construction, the hotel was originally designed to be a residential property, so all of the rooms have an open layout studio apartment feel. Decor features a modern shabby-chic style that is elegant and aesthetically pleasing. Parking is paid valet only. There are also multiple paid self parking lots nearby. Hotel staff was very friendly and courteous. Free wifi for hotel guests.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>There are a lot of hotels in LA, and you could literally spend the next ten years checking them all out,  but you can't go wrong with the Redbury. The rooms are the furtherest thing from conventional. They're something along the lines of a cool loft you would see in the movies. Every room is furnished with a small kitchen,  an amazing bed,  a really comfortable sitting area and balcony. The service is top notch,  there's a great bar with spacious outdoor seating and valet parking. The rooms don't come cheap,  but you really do feel like you're getting a great value for your money.< /Text><user_id>115623616059859182708<//user_id><gmap_id>0x80c2bf393e0f2acb:0xff45b8a57d952d1d< /gmap_id>< name>

Drinks were really well made and staff is extremely nice. My group was almost moved from a table because a group of people bought it. Other than that it was great, music is a bit loud if you're not into that I would stay away and there's one pool table.</Review>

Unique, hip and just kitchy enough to be cute while having everything you want in an upscale hotel. Make sure you try our their restaurant Cleo for some Sticky Toffee Pudding and Mediterranean small plates. But beware of the nights they have live music in the courtyard, it can be quite loud in the rooms. Though the courtyard is cute I wonder if they missed an opportunity for a pool. Either way book a night or 5 here if you have to stay in Hollywood!<//Text></record>

I visited The Library at the Redbury Hotel. Great decoration and ambiance in the interior portion, and the outdoor patio area had a great view. Cocktails were excellent as well.<//Text>

The service was incredible. We loved the suite, however it is quiet loud until really late at night. The staff accommodated us though and moved us to a room that was quieter.< /Review>

Located at the vine street. One can enjoy the walk of fame and the mural on the wall adjoining world hip hop beats. Excellent service at cleo which offers authentic Greek food tweaked according to the guests preference.< /Text>

<Text>Total rip off!  Great looking hotel, however be cautious.  Numerous hidden charges.  Staff was rude and very unprofessional.  Had to wait 3 and 1/2 hours for room to be ready, check in was at 3, room was not ready until 6:30; not only for myself but several others.  I actually had to clean the room myself and no towels were initially provided.  No hot water and items missing from parked vehicle.  Other guest had similar complaints. TV did not properly operate and a/c-heater was noisy.  Management was rude and provided no support or response.<//Text>< resp>

Beautiful hotel.  Lovely room. Just don't plan on getting any sleep. There is a club next door to the north and live rock bands blare till all hours, through an open retractable roof, (which is left open all night, so the rock band will seem like it is playing full blast right on your balcony. )7 days a week. A call to the manager will get you, incredibly, an offer of earplugs and sleeping medicine! They openly acknowledge it is noisy all the time, you can only get peace in the pricier one bedroom suites on the other side of the hotel. Be warned.<//Text>

One of the managers (Kevin) went above and beyond what was necessary to make sure we were happy and taken care of when there was a small delay with the room we were checking into. You can totally tell when someone enjoys their job and the industry they're in.</Text>

<review>The review is only for the Library Bar. A very friendly waitress and reasonable drinks save this place. The staff flushed us out of a corner lounge area without warning, after we enjoyed a bottle of wine. They were verbally pushy and stating they had another reservation. When they returned with our bill, "gratuity was added for our convenience". BS - they recognized their poor service but still took their tip. You may have a good experience, but you risk the wrath of their convenience...  I do not recommend the Library Bar.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Had my birthday party at the library bar @ the redbury. The food was excellent but the service was terrible! My gin and tonic was more like tonic with a splash of gin. Extremely light drinks. There was about 60 people in my party alone. The place was over maximum capacity allowed for sure. There was one waitress. I felt so bad for her. I will not go back or recommend.</Text>

<username>Norm Mccallson< /username><rate>2<//rate><text>The hotel was very nice convenient for the Pantages.  We ate at Cleo's and the meal and the service was excellent. Now for the problem they advertise the library bar on the hotel web site and the outdoor patio 2 of the reasons i was looking forward to my stay.
I wanted to have a drink before dinner and the individual standing at the door informed me there was a private party and i could not go in. I asked if i could just look in so i could see what it was like for my next stay. He said no and was quite rude. I think it is horrible for the hotel to charge over 400.00 a night and then not even allow you to use the whole facility and we could not take advantage of the patio either. The hotel should at least inform the guests ahead of time or discount the room. Because of this my review gets a 2 star.<//text><time>1400544244868<//time><user>115561945592681612192<//user><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmapID>

<Name>Nicole Torres<//Name><review>“Great hotel & location!”
I found this place back in June when I was starting to plan my trip out to the West Coast and after booking the hotel and a few emails back and forth with Bryan (who is excellent!), I felt completely confident with my choice. I had seen that there could be issues with noise from TA and so had paid in advance to upgrade to a room on the other side of the building. Once we got there, we got offered to either take that room or a different upgrade - to a Hollywood Premier Suite which was also incredibly quiet although lacking the view of the Hollywood sign/Capitol Records building. We went to see the room and were blown away by the size of it - 850 sq ft made you feel like you were in an apartment rather than a hotel room.

The main reasons this hotel gets a 5* rating from me are:
- Staff. They are absolutely wonderful and can't do enough for you. We're two late-20s girls and they told us where to head for nightlife/bars and were spot on for what we wanted.
- Location. Close enough to Hollywood but avoiding most of the tourist traffic which is a godsend. If you do the Hop On/Hop Off with Starline there's a bus stop around the block which saves you a 15 minute walk.
- Restaurant. Cleo was the best restaurant we ate at in Los Angeles and I'd go back in a heartbeat. It was buzzy, the food was brilliant & the bill was reasonable.
- Decoration. It's incredibly stylish and I loved the way the room was set out. My only gripe was the shower pressure wasn't brilliant although the rainfall shower was very cool.< /review><Date>1484726558673<//Date><Pics>None</Pics><userid>110763951031571640868< /userid><rate>5</rate>< Resp>

The rooms are clean and nicely decorated. The rooms with the kitchen suite include 2 gas burners, a microwave, and fridge. It was nice that they also provided plates, utensils, and a tea kettle. Downsides included the room sharing an alley with a very loud club next door. The windows and doors have an acoustic seal, but the bass is still very noticable. None of the wifi is free, which was the most upsetting considering the price of the room.<//Review>

The redbury was nice it had a nice atmosphere to it . the workers were kind . seems like something I would be back for . I would just think its kinda small of a space but I loved the pool table and the frames with the camera is a nice touch . the parking just wasn't great but I would like to check out the rooms and the restaurant .</text>

Unusual, eccentric, like an ageing hippy hotel. Spacious rooms, seductive (read dim) lighting with more switches than you can count on two hands, no bathtub in suite, vast flat wash basin designed by someone with more ambition than practical sense. Worst aspect is the noise. If overlooking courtyard, ghastly music blasts loudly on until 1.30am  Friday & Saturday. Other nights 11pm. Loudish music in all public areas including breakfast room at all times. nice staff, comfortable beds. You pays your money (quite a lot) and you takes your choice....< /text>

This boutique hotel in Hollywood has a great bar called The Library. The drinks are delish and their social hour menu features dishes from the obsite restaurant Cleo. It's in the middle of the action, across from the Capitol Records building and close to tourist stops like the Pantages Theater.</Review>

< review>
My husband booked The Redbury as a surprise part of our vacation based on the incredible TripAdvisor reviews. We arrived and were greeted by the very nice and helpful valet staff who, as you'll come to understand after reading further, were the best part of our entire stay at The Redbury.

We arrived late on a Saturday night in the midst of their busy night at their club/bar. Important to note that the bar/club extends from the first floor to the second, where the check-in desk is, so if you arrive on a Saturday night, you have to contend with the club crowd to check-in.

Upon checking in, we were greeted by a manager who gave us 2 room options, the room we had paid for; the room with the view of the Hollywood sign/Capitol Records building which he warned would be noisy, or a downgraded room in a quieter section of the building for no discount. We chose the quieter room which had some semblance of a view (as much as a 2nd floor could have), and began settling in.

Immediately we noticed cleanliness issues, not the least of which was an old blood stain on the pillowcase. We tried to overlook it, but upon turning the sheets down, found a bug. Not saying it was a bed beg, but it was an unidentified bug in the bed. We alerted the manager who assured us that they had no bed bug problem without viewing the bug in question, but he offered to move us to another room anyway. He moved us to a larger room on the same floor, but without any view which we had paid extra for. In addition, he assured us that we'd be taken care of with a bottle of champagne and breakfast which my husband graciously accepted. He also said he would check-in with us throughout our stay.

Sounds great, right? It did to us at the time. Our new room smelled clean (the first did not have this same smell), but then the problems continued. The toilet wasn't functioning properly, so at 1am (we had checked in at about 10pm, this ordeal lasted far too long), the manger brought a maintenance person to fix it. We were trying to settle in when we noticed hair stuck in the living room chairs, and were considering leaving. Having had to prepay for this entire stay, we had no choice but to give the manager a chance, and settled in (after checking the bed thoroughly :)) for the night.

The next morning I jumped into the large shower and while showering noticed there were about a half dozen or so stickers on the black tile wall. I figured out that they were from the shampoo bottles which have safety seals (the ones we were left were broken), so obviously other guests had peeled them off and stuck them to the wall and they weren't cleaned/removed.

Upon walking around the flat, it was clear that the rooms were badly in need of upkeep. The furniture had stains, the furniture was chipped/peeling, the drawers in the bathroom didn't function properly, counters were scratched, and the towels/linens were literally falling apart at the seams.

The next 4 nights were without major incident, however, we never received our champagne, our breakfast, and the manager who claimed to be so eager to make sure we had a great stay never checked in with us as he had promised he would.

A few days into our stay we noticed a $600 hold on the debit card we provided for "incidentals," a big deal when you're not alerted like every other hotel in the country does. As everyone knows, if you provide a card for incidentals, it's either charged about $100, or not at all. We prepaid, so there is no reason to put that kind of a hold on the card. I'd suspect that given the disrepair of the 2 rooms we saw, they are charging for damage quite often, and apparently not repairing it.

The highlight of The Redbury was, by far, the Valet staff who were extremely friendly and helpful. For the cost of this place, we could have stayed in a far nicer part of LA and had a much better experience. If you're looking to stay in this part of Hollywood, the W across the street looks like a far better option for a similar price (it's easily worth the few extra bucks).< /review>

<Review>This place is between like a four and five star rating.
I went on a Friday around 8pm. It was peaceful at the time. The bartender is nice and makes great drinks! My margarita was nice and strong. The atmosphere is cute and comfortable. More people started to fill up the place around 10pm or so. There's a dj that's there like around 9-ish. The music isn't loud which is perfect for what I wanted that night.
There are heat lamps and fire pits outside,so don't be afraid of going in the cold.
The people that check ID are friendly.
Parking wise, there's valet and parking around. Look at other reviews for parking situation because I ubered that night. I dislike being stressed out by the hollywood area.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Great hotel and rooms, a film noir vibe and not your usual hotel. Room was spacious, with kitchen and bar area, lounge area with big TV, large comfortable bed and great walk in shower. Decor features alot of red, as in Redbury, everything was clean and well maintained. The location was good, if your after the area of Hollywood and Vine that is. The ground floor has the parking and a middle eastern restaurant, didn't try but looks nice and was busy. First floor has the reception/concierge (efficient and friendly) and a roof top bar and decked area (again didn't try but looked nice and was busy). The hotel is in a c shape so this covers the area in the middle. A short walk (10min) down Hollywood (follow the stars) gets you to highland with the dolby theater etc and views of the Hollywood sign. Across Vine Street is the Capitol Records building and quick access to the freeway 101. It's not a cheap stay but then what is these days and there are probably plenty of cheaper places around but all in all I didn't mind paying a bit more than I usually do, for the location and staying somewhere abit different.<//Review>

<Review>We sat upstairs in the library area and ordered a bunch of drinks and food several times...it was my friends bday, 20 minutes before kitchen closes we ordered more food 20 minutes later the girl comes back and tells us the kitchen is closed.....the bill was close to $700 for 5 people.....after complaining to manager he brought out 3 deserts and then 6 shots on them .....but to tell you the truth we where still hungry....the portions they give you are really small....so for the money we spent we felt like we had to stop at in n out to complete the night....nice place and atmospher....but the service and attitude was kind of shity</Review></record>

This hotel is GREAT! Just put it in a better neighborhood & it would be PERFECT (Hollywood is crummy. Except for Rob Pattinson's hands. They are not. Well, actually.. there were crumbs in his handprints when I put mine in his. Yes. I said that)

The rooms are HUGE. Super romantic. Especially when you're there with your bff. The mini bar rules. Especially when you have a per diem. Just watch out for the teeny bottle of champy-- it's $55!

All in all- stay here! It was fab!< /Review>

Everyone else is right about the eclectic atmosphere, furnishings and ambiance.  This place is gorgeous and I really applaud SBE for their ability to combine authenticity with modern conveniences in a great location for any Hollywood visitor.

Unfortunately the service was very poor.  We booked in with our two kids and yet the room was only prepped for two (two towels, two bathrobes, etc.).  When we called to have the spare bed made up they sent a maid who spoke no English at all and made our kids' bed with just a sheet - she evidently thought they needed neither a quilt nor pillows!  When we called again half an hour later, they sent a guy with a really crappy attitude who just dumped the quilt and pillows on a chair, and turned on his heel and left the room without a word.  After calling a third time they sent that same guy back and he finally actually made the kids' bed.

We spent the next day out of the room for the whole day, leaving the "Please Make Up My Room" sign hanging on the door.  Evidently the maid with no English mistook that sign for the "Do Not Disturb" sign so when we returned to our room after a very busy and exhausting day, our room hadn't been made up.  Ack!

Add to this a few small things like that they make mention of wifi access in the _"Standard Amenities"_ section of their website, and yet that's the pathetic $10 per day gouge that any decent hotel includes for no extra these days, also the business center they talk about that was $5 for 15 minutes on a computer in an alcove in the lobby and printing was (I think) 50¢ per black & white page!  Both totally ridiculous fees considering what you pay.

I may as well round out my rant with some other sundries; it's just stupid to provide a spatula but no frypan, a cooking spoon but no saucepan, a chopping board but no carving knife, a mini bar with no pricelist, and a balcony with the airconditioning outlet (the hot air that goes outside) blowing at you!  Oh and "luxury bathrobe", you jest!<//review>

Busy, Starbucks coffee. Not my favorite. Prefer even McDonald's. Still, it's Disney so some fun twists.
Thank you Cast Members, Imagineers and Creators for all your hard work. Love and miss you all.  #templemastery</Text>

This is actually Starbucks.  The employees here do more time talking to each other than working.  This is the slowest Starbucks ever!  The one 100 yards away in Disneyland is faster.

This Starbucks is located in California Adventure which is part of Disney.  There is no reason for one to be great and this one to be off the rails.  Isn't anyone paying attention?< /Review>

<review>Starbucks by Disney with the same drinks and many not all of the pastries & breakfast sandwiches.  Disney has added packed sandwiches & salads in display fridges.
-These are the cheapest Starbucks prices in town plus annual pass holders can get an additional 15% off. My venti iced tea was $3.14 after the discount.  Same drink off Disney property was $6.05.< /review>< pics>

After I ordered one thing he assumed that was it and charged me two separate orders with an attitude. He didn’t wait for me to finish ordering thats why it was separate. Like I understand that it must be tiring to work there but still. Calm your attitude you’re working at the happiest place on earth smh.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

It's pretty much a Starbucks, so you know what you're getting if you like Starbucks. Prices might be a little higher since it's inside Disneyland. Lines can get long but they try to get you moving as soon as possible. Lots of inside seating available and it's cute inside, like an old diner.< /Review>

If you go here for the coffees and sandwiches, it's great! If you go for the refreshers, not so great. I had two strawberry acai refreshes on separate days made by different people and they were watered down and just terrible. Considering this is a Starbucks in Disney's California Adventure, I expect a  bit better. My recommendation is park hop to Market House or hit the one in Downtown Disney.<//review>

Elizabeth was easily the rudest Starbucks employee I have ever met. I was politely ordering my drink and she continued to interrupt me while I ordered asking if that was it. Then when I said no she gave me this look like I killed her cat and had awful body language and said" okay, then keep ordering". I have never had an issue at a Starbucks until now and I never plan on returning to this Starbucks. And for the record I am not some suburban mom whining that her drink had half and half in it. I was just trying to get a double shot.</text>

I was waiting with my son for the rest of the people in my group who were in line for the guardians of the galaxy. I walked in thinking they were open, and the guy in front said they were just closing up but they would probably give me a glass of water since I was very pregnant.  When I asked the girl in the store for water, she said they dont give out water,  and they were closed. So I asked if she knew anywhere in the park where I could buy water. She rolled her eyes and said nowhere sells water when the park is closed. so i asked if there was any way she could just please give me a glass of water, you have no idea how thirsty I was and they literrally were just barely closing and the tap for water was still working. She finally gave me one tiny glass of water less than half full and gave me a really dirty look, so since it was barely full, honestly how hard would it have been for the girl just to fill it up, she obviously barely filled it up just to be rude, so I asked if I could have another one for my son, at which every one working in the store ignored me and finally a guy angrily gave me another glass of water and threw it on the counter. I would of happily bought water if there was anywhere in the park to buy some and I was being nice the whole time. They were the rudest employees. When i left the guy who was cleaning said he was sorry they were so rude. I do think there should at least be one place open to serve drinks once the park is closed, especially when the stores are still open.<//text>

I heard about the cute Disney Park cups so I wanted to check it out.  They serve Starbucks drinks: Frappuccino, Smoothies, Espresso, Starbucks Refreshers, Teavana Iced Tea, Coffee, Tea, and pastries, etc. The lines are long but they go by fast. There are two sections inside, one for Starbucks items and the other side sells ice cream.

~Drinks~
I got my famous Green Tea Latte (Iced), they made it perfect.

~Customer Service~
To the point and quick.

~Highlight~
Cute cups!

~Rating~
If you're craving for Starbucks go here.  They made my Green Tea Latte (Iced), just right.  I would give it 4 Stars if the customer service was better.

~Notes~
~Seating is available inside and outside
~Located in California Adventure by the entrance</review>

<Review>It's just a Starbucks. It's a Starbucks with bad service, to boot. They got our drinks wrong and the people working the registers are surly. I don't know how they get away with describing themselves as some sort of artisanal sandwich place or whatever nonsense we read when we decided to head there for breakfast.</Review>< pictures>

<review>2/20/18 I ordered a hot chai tea latte from the Starbucks at California great adventures.  My drink was so watered down and did not taste like the chai lattes from any other Starbucks I have ordered from. Even though they remade the drink , I'm positive I won't be going back there for anything!< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Typical Starbucks, but inside the DIsney California Adventure experience -- long lines, noisy, etc. They need a Fast Pass for this place. Otherwise, a cool respite from 98-degree heat in the first week of November.</review>

For drinks this is the place. Just don't buy the self proclaimed "famous" cinnamon roll because it's nothing more than a small Philsbury self baked roll for a whopping $6.< /Review>

They are a lifesaver! First off, I live in Oregon and didn’t travel for a birthday this year so I called to have a cake delivered- did not disappoint! The cake was beautiful, delivered on time, and I was told it tasted amazing! Super easy to call over the phone, they wrote on it and delivered it next day(on a Sunday!) Without charging a huge fee. I will definitely go there next time I visit my family, and will definitely be giving sending more cakes as gifts!< /review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>I was in today hoping to get the vanillaCake +raspberry jar which I love so much and was so excited to see one jar left on display, I asked for it and she picked it up and put it aside and told me that it was old and she wouldn’t serve it. No one would go here if everything wasn’t prepared the same day. So clearly I was lied to and she had a very patronizing tone. I am very disappointed.
It doesn’t matter to me that I couldn’t get what I wanted, But a little politeness and honesty would be least one would expect as a customer.< /Review>< Pictures>

So we got closer and there sat groups of people enjoying hot chocolate and pastries. We just had have our late night pastry. As we walked in we were welcome with friendly smiles and excellent service. I had a Hot Dark Chocolate top with whip cream and a unicorn vanilla cupcake made to perfection just made with enough sugar. My husband had Milk hot Chocolate with coconut milk and cheese cake Oreo. I would highly recommend this place to all.< /Text><gmapID>0x809ae50661630dbd:0x37a66c40c8b313e4< /gmapID>< pics>

The cake was so bad we could t even eat it there was hair in it and they put sticks all over in the cake.
Also the cake was over 300$ and we couldn’t even eat it. Thank you sweet treat of Folsom for ruining my daughters 18 th birthday and refusing to give me back half of my money. These people are crooks so please don’t order cakes from them and all there treats are over priced.</Text></record>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>So we ordered custom cakes for a birthday party. When we got the cakes they looked so pretty, the decorations were really cute and exactly what I envisioned. When we tasted the cake it was not good, it was dry and seemed like it was baked early then just put into the freezer. Not only was the cake dry but there was a lot of frosting in between the cake. Almost equal parts cake to frosting. Which doesn’t seem like it’s worth the money. Unfortunately, I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone looking for a custom cake.<//review>< Pics>

The best fondant cake ever. I ordered a 3-tier birthday cake for my daughter’s first birthday and it turned out to be the best thing I did in the party. The mango mousse with vanilla flavor was so delicious that every guest asked about the cake shop. The texture and the taste was just awesome. The decorations on the cake was just perfect and exactly same as shown to me when I ordered the cake. The pricing is just perfect for such a yummy cake. Please do try it for your next occasion.<//review>

I usually dont leave reviews.  But i felt this should be said since it was slightly embarrassing and gross for me🤦‍♀️ I bought a cake for a birthday party and there were 3 hairs found in the cake. One was found by a party guest, and 2 were then found by me.  Because i started looking at every bite i took. Two were a blackish long hair in the cake and 1 looked to be like an animal hair inside  the icing.  I do not know if they wear hair nets while baking,  but they should. So this does not happen.  Other than that, the cake was delicious and looked beautiful!</text>

<Review>Wife and I recently moved to the area and are looking for a place to satisfy our sweet tooth. We tried the mini Oreo cheesecake, iced lemon bar and the unicorn cupcake. While presentation was perfect, all three were dry as if they were made days ago and had been sitting out. The cupcake had no flavor whatsoever. So sad since this place is super cute!</Review>< pics>

<text>So far this is the best croissant I ever had.  Tried the Chocolate almond croissant, it is so yummy!  It had melted chocolate and almond paste inside, so tasty.  The croissant is fresh and crisp.</text>< pictures>

This is one of the most fire bakeries I have been to ever, the brownie bar won my vote in one of the most tastiest desserts ever, Donald King is a joke he doesn't know good service if it slapped him in the face, awesome sweets keep it up!!!<//Text>

She was uncertain with options to pick she kept asking for help that I requested for the manager and she ended up doing my taxes. I do not recommend this HR Block to get your taxes done as they take your refunds without notifying the customer that state has even been received. So not only did they take my hole state taxes they take my federal taxes as well. I am a single mom of 4 kids and this place took advantage I will NEVER return..</text>< Pictures>

I'd be happy to brag about and recommend this fantastic shopping center to everyone. This shopping center has everything I like. This place was just a few minutes away by car. It has my highest recommendation!< /Review>< pictures>

We went to Bonchon. I for the first time tried it in Sacramento just days ago. I found one in San Jose and was too excited to have my daughter try the sliders. Well.....awful! Not only did they put the meat on burger buns, but left the onions and cucumbers off. When I called she said, "yeah they come with burger buns." I spent $45 there. If I wanted a burger I would have gone to Carl's Jr. Never again</Review>

Farmer's market there on Wednesday s and Sundays. 9:00 to 1:00 ... great selection of organic, local fruits and vegetables .. plus almond milks,  homemade soaps, local honey and good Mexican food.  The hardware store is empty ... but there may be a new one there soon.<//review>

Shopping center has been around for years.  If you live here, it's great. If you're visiting, it might be disappointing. Empty stores, older businesses and restaurants. But the Chinese food is great</review>

Went to pick up a pizza at Murphy's, always great pizza in the people are always very nice, stop by Orchard Supply but their prices were still outrageous. I hope a Supermarket takes over the spot where Orchard was, they could really use one in that area.<//Review>

< review>
It's your standard suburban strip mall, where you can buy a 50lb bag of chicken guano for your garden, a cup of coffee, a birthday card, a bible, and you can even stop in the recruiting office and join the U.S Marine Corps...all in one stop. Get in, get what you need, get out. Nothing notable here.<//review>

Go here for the bakery. Lovely bakery, wonderful staff, however, they have a small collection of cakes so it is better to go in advance and order one, plus the food is worth it.< /text>

<Text>Lots of great places to eat and lots of good retailers.  I love the Walgreens pharmacy here.  I get all my prescriptions here.  Last time I dropped off a prescription in their drive thru that I needed urgently and they got it ready in 15 minutes; meanwhile, I went and grabbed some dinner, then came back to the drive thru and my prescription was ready.< /Text>< user_id>
