The girl who helped me try to find the right  package and give me a quote prior shipping. Very helpful and knowledgeable!!!

I was going to ship my package to Myanmar and had some problems with putting address and phone number in but the girl who helped me was very patient and try to find a correct way to fill it out with me throughout the process. Love it!!!</Review><name>Roleen Woo<//name>< UserId.>

It was first time shipping internationally, and Kedir made the entire process quick, easy, and efficient.  I appreciate how he shares all of the possible shipping options and costs so that you pay the lowest amount possible.  He helped me pack the items and itemize it.  It took less than 15 minutes.  I highly recommend and will return when I need to ship again.  Professional and friendly.  Thanks Kedir.</text>

I was skeptical about them because of couple bad reviews.. But it was yelp.. And you guys know people on yelp and yelp itself.. If you don't answer to yelp extortion they limit good review and they post bad ones up top.. even if they were from people never step a foot in your business.. I use DHL more than any carrier and Mr. Khidir always there with best advice how to cut costs on shipping.. Smaller box.. Adding more stuff for the same price.. I even thought he hate his boss and don't want his boss to profit.. I was shocked when I knew he is the owner.. Wasn't he suppose to squeeze every penny from customers.. Specially with covid.. I know I would..  I guess that explains the returning happy customers.. It's not just him.. Even his employees.. If they couldn't save you money they call him for money saving tips with you even asking.. And super amazing service.. I don't mind waiting an extra 5 minutes.. NBA always on.. Water bottles keeps coming.. Sometimes I wish if I can just hang out there n chill.. All the best guys< /text>

I needed to ship some stuff to Italy and my first experience coming to this place was awesome. Customer service is at a corporate level for a small business. Now, today I had to ship another package to Italy no hassle they clearly and precisely explain all shipping option with the best customer service. If you need to ship anything worldwide this place needs to be your one stop shop.< /text>

Fast. Easy. Reasonable prices. Had to return some items that were faulty (clothes). Great service. Thank you!

Edit: Owner is fantastic! Love the service from these guys. The reviews don't lie. They take care of ya. I drive from Whittier just for here, given the fact that all the DHL points near me have horrible reviews.< /review>

Spoke to the owner today, very friendly hard working man. I believe this is a one man operation that he is running, but he does it well and efficiently. The clerk was beyond friendly and made sure that my package was going to where it needed to go.< /text>

Kedir has a good customer service. He packed my stuff, made copies of documents and friendly. I shopped for shipping my mom’s meds and when i asked for qoutation, no one gave unless i send it thru them but with Kedir, he was very willing that i have to come back and decided for the price and send it thru his shipping store. It was delayed for 4 days as the country is on lockdown. Will come back if needed.</review>

Easy Shipping in Anaheim, is the best U-Haul outlet I have ever found and used. I am a very satisfied customer. Kadir, the business owner has been, every time, very helpful and professional. He really believes in customer service excellence. Equipment have been clean and in good working condition. This time, I got a new truck with only 10,818 miles. It was great..!!
Location is excellent, in the center of "Little Arabia", with very easy access to freeways and main avenues as Lincoln, Brookhurst, Euclid, and Ball. The very best U-Haul outlet...!!!<//Text>

To be honest, costumer service is the best ever I have experienced. Have been to there twice, each time before I leave they give me a bottle of water as gift. They serve me very well, I don’t have to do many things. They really care about you and will make the process as simply as possible. Every time when I need to ship DHL I will go nowhere else. Keep on dong good work!<//review>

Kedir knows how to get the job done. You want a place where they know what they're doing and knows how to do it efficiently and fast! It took me literally 15minutes. They are very courteous and accurate. Totally recommend this place!<//text>

This place is spectacular. If you were thinking abput going to a Fedex or UPS store you thought wrong. To ship cross country was surprisingly cheap. The customer service is top notch. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS STORE OVER ANY OTHER SHIPPING CENTER.< /review>

Phenomenal customer service! I came here on a Sunday to get a live scan done for work and Kedir and another young gentleman were very accomodating, kind, and quick. I have done 3 livescans in the past 6 months and thus far, this has been my absolute favorite location. I highly recommend anyone in need of a livescan to consider this location. If you need to ship something out, although I have not used those services here, I am confident that you will also have a pleasant experience.<//review>

We rented a U-Haul trailer from Easy Shipping.  The owner was very friendly and helped my husband attach the trailer to our car to be sure everything was working.  Would recommend them for shipping as well.  Will be dropping off my UPS and FedEx packages here from now on.<//review>

LOCAL and FAST!!!!!! Always taking care of me every step of the way. Shipping out my stuff was easy and cheap. They are verified by DHL, FEDEX,  and POSTAL SERVICS. If you want to rent out a UHAUL they are also an authorized UHAUl Dealer. I will always recommend this place.</Text>

Went in and the owner helped me ship a package through FedEX shipping label. He printed my label and I was out smooth as butter, would return for all my shipping needs as it is close and convenient to home.</Review>

<Review>This was the best experience I've had at a shipping place, the guy was fast and didn't want to upsell me nada.

In-n-out across the street is slower than them.<//Review>< user_id>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I checked the business hour multiple times before my first visit. I used the google feature to determine when it would be least busy to get my car washed. I got there an hour before closing and it was completely closed, not one employee in sight. I called the next day to confirm the hours off operation and the employee stated the same 8a.m.-5p.m. that was advertised. I told her I came by the day before and she casually stated they closed early, because business was slow, no apology offered. I decided to go again at noon to avoid early closing. When I got there, an employee served the car ahead of me then approximately 5 minutes later told me they don’t service Tesla’s at all. I drove twice to this location and it was a complete waste.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Thank you, Offshore Auto Spa!

They did an amazing job on my Black Accord! The paint looks like it's fresh off the assembly line, and virtually free of any swirl marks!

I went with the full exterior service, which includes a wash, wax and detail among many other things, and I'm fully satisfied with how it came out. You will not get a better look with any self-service car wash.

Depending on what service you want, you may spend an hour to a few hours, so I recommend to bringing something for entertainment, or dropping off your vehicle for a little while. Expect to pay substantially more than your regular $10 carwash, but it's worth every penny if you value the look of your car!

11/10 would recommend to a friend!</Text>

I paid for a full service wash. They did not Vacuum at all. All they did was add a cheap scent dressing on my dashboard. Not to mention the rude attitude from everyone.< /Text>

Love coming here, I drive past at least 5 car wash places before I arrive here. I usually don't have to wipe down anything when I get home. Hence the 4 stars I have before but that's my ocd.</Review>

Not very happy this time, I spent $80.00 to have it washed, vacuumed, windows inside and out as well as armor all inside and out. They decided to dry my truck in the sun instead of under the shade. I have waterspots on some of the windows as well as on the body. They also didn't do all the black rubber on the outside with armor all. When I asked about the armor all he told me because of the heat it would run all down the paint. NOT HAPPY.</text>

Most important to me prior to choosing a car wash place is whether or not it's 100% hand wash. I prefer that over machine wash because it's does a better job. With that said, this place is NOT hand wash; it is machine wash. I can see the left over dirt spot in which the machine missed. For these reasons I gave it 4 stars</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>LIVID about service (or no service). WORKERS DIDN'T WEAR MASKS. I was refused servicemservice Thursday morning June 18th. I had my mask and gloves on, but the 2 guys who vacuum car before wash had none. I asked them to put one on because and I quote " I have a medically compromised person at home". Didn't say I have COVID but they jumped to that conclusion. RUDE, UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME AND I'VE BEEN GOING HERE FOR YEARS!!!!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Review>I got the package that details the whole inside of my car and my car looks brand new!! They did such an amazing job & really took their time.

<review>I like there car wash and I have used them multiple times, I have taken a car there for detailing a couple years back  and was very satisfiedHowever I took my car in recently for a detail and when I got home I went to put the mats back down on the floor, to my surprise the whole back part of my car(Ford Flex) had NOT been vacuumed and the third row seats not touched or wiped down!!!!!!!!!
120.00 really! They need to have a second set of eyes before they release the car back to you! Unsatisfied, I called and got a free wash but it’s is besides the point.< /review><Rating>2< /Rating>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I have been bringing my vehicles to this facility for years. Some days the car looks wonderful and then there are days like today when you get it home and see all they didn’t do. The back inside window was not cleaned. I realize that it’s at a tough angle but this is why I let someone else do it. The rims were not cleaned. The trunk( which was completely empty) was not vacuumed. I am starting to think that I may be better off going down the street to the do it yourself place, where they was the outside, but you dry and clean the inside. Very disappointed.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<text>If I could have done this review without putting any stars I would have.   I took my brand new Toyota Highlander in today (12/29/2018) and they cracked my windshield.  The manager said I had a chip which caused the crack.  There wasn't a chip before I took my car in to be washed.  They said there was a sign about chips in windows and windows cracking.  This is not the case it said hot windows crack with cold water.<//text><rate>1</rate><pictures>None<//pictures>< date>

I don't recall the specific names of the service I got, but it was an interior exterior package for $90. For the wash the car is pushed through a brush type automated system. There are windows where the customer can watch part of the wash process. After the wash my vehicle was coincidentally pulled into a spot directly in front of where I was sitting. The employees were very meticulous, detail oriented, and deliberate. Until now I had been using a car wash near my job and had been looking for one closer to home. I think I found it!< /review>

I requested a copy of the said video. Let's see if I get it.

< Review>
Spent $100 on an interior detail, went to leave and noticed they didn't clean my seats (that I paid an extra $50 to have done) They took it back and cleaned them. But the next day when my son got in the back we noticed they didn't move my seats to vacuum, they didn't vacuum the trunk. (Yes I asked them to, and emptied it) and there was something sticky splattered across my instrument panel.</Review>

This was my first time here and I really liked it! The attendant was very helpful and the service (opted for the Malibu Wash) was exceptional! I recommend going right when they open so you don't have to wait long. Stopped by around 11am and got out around 11:30ish, so not bad. They have a nice lobby with AC and flatscreen tvs. Will definitely visit again!<//text>

I have been coming here for a year and never got a free 10th wash bc I was paying $45 instead of $21.95 so I was told after all this time it doesnt qualify for a free 10th wash! So you dont appreciate people who pay more? What? This doesnt even make sense! Unbelievable,  I drive across town just to come here so I can build up my washed for a free 10th wash and NOW after coming every 3 weeks that I haven't gotten cresit towards my free wash! Never again. I have given this place over the past year tons of praise and now this? Really isnt right.

Alao, I went there the other day, the guy tells me, oh its now $65 for detailing, they didn't clean the windows and the trunk like he said he would, had to go back next day and get a whole new detail. Wasted my day, my gas, my time and they didn't even offer for a cheaper cleaning next time! I don't know who is running the show over there but if this was my business,  I would want to know everything and make sure I made it right so my customers would be back! So two strikes now, not sure I will tey for the 3rd.<//text>

<review>My wife had her car washed today and when she got home noticed her back seat had white powder brushed all over it and there were smears of it on the doors. Like someone had wax or polish on their shirt and laid across the backseat when vacuuming. She took her car back 30 minutes later and talked to the manager who said they did not do it and that she should have "her husband try wiping it off with a wet rag or something."

It would have taken them 5 minutes to "wipe it off with a wet rag or something" and keep a customer happy. Now they lost my business and I will let others know of our experience.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>I use to go here and they would do an excellent job! The last few times the service has been poor. I don't pay for the basic wash and they failed to even wipe down the interior. When I told the manager he acted like I was rude to ask for the service I paid for! I won't be going back and wasting anymore money!</Review><Response>None<//Response>< name>

<Review>This was the 2nd time taking a vehicle to this location.  I have a 2500HD and the results were not good.  Windows were smeared and still had spots.  There was dust under the door handles.  Paid for the higher package that was supposed to include outside dressing and they only did the mirrors.  There streaks and water marks all over.  The inside was not thoroughly cleaned.  I will not be bringing any of my vehicles back to this place.  The quality of service in these types of car washes has significantly degraded.  I would rather pay more for a mobile detailer.</Review><rating>1</rating><user_name>trent witte<//user_name>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>Worst wash in town, been here twice and both times they did a horrible job. Second time I got the more expensive was hoping they would do a better job and wash the dried bird poop off the front of my car but I had to make them do it after a walk around and they gave me an attitude for asking them to do it. Also they did not clean the cup holder that I paid extra for again I had to request it, and got attitude when I did. I got so tired of asking the guy to fix things that should have been addressed that I asked for the towel and I ended up cleaning the inside of my car myself.. I'm done with this place.< /text>< Pics>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>I paid $16 for the Malibu wash. First time I've taken my car to a full service place like this. I watched the car the entire way and it seemed to be handled ok. They left it to sit for 10 minutes after the wash before they came over to start drying and the end result was awful water spotting all over the car. Several dozen large (quarter sized) water spots and hundreds of little spots all over the car. It now looks worse than when I came in. They weren't busy and no one seemed to be rushing. To their credit the windows, interior, wheels and tires look good. Everything could have been great if not for the delay in finishing. I will not be going back.<//Text>< Rating>

<review>This is the second horrible job we have gotten from this place and it will be the last time we go there. When they opened and for the first few years, they did an excellent job but it has been slowly going down hill. Like the last time, there were still crumbs in the console and fingerprints and smudges on the dash and inside panels. I know they told us the last time that vacuuming up dog hair was not part of their service but they didn't even get the basic stuff off the carpet. I called and a snotty girl answered the phone and after I had to argue with the rude manager to wipe the inside of the car last time I just don't have it in me to go through that again. If I can save even one person from wasting their time this will at least be worth it. Do yourself a favor aind someone else who cares to wash your car.</review><user>107562690456326271273<//user></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>3</Rating><Review>Store is good and staff are excellent and extremely helpful. Just disappointed in their "military discount." I've been receiving my military discount since 1989. This is the first store that ever told me the discount only applies to items for me and not for items I'm buying for my wife and kids. Immediate family members are just as much military members as the soldiers are. If you don't understand that, then you know nothing of a military family. With that said, I'm disappointed in this company's military discount "policy."</Review>< Pics>

Wow- I haven't been to this store in person but their customer service is incredible! I was tracking down a shirt that was unavailable online and sold out everywhere else but their store. They went above and beyond to help find it and ship it to me-- thanks again!< /review>

Went into Athletics/Lululemon in Arden to exchange some WunderUnder leggings (I really hated them), Enrique helped me, and he is AWESOME! He picked out a couple of different styles, suggested the sizing (I was going to size up, he insisted that I size down...he was right!),and I found a pair that I love! Thank you, Enrique...I will definitely be back!< /Text>

First, I have to start with, I NEVER write reviews...... But today I was overwhelmed by an AMAZING gal you have working at your Arden location... I came in in order to find a pair of pants and sweater for my mother... She was recently diagnosed with cancer and is in the hospital recovering from surgery and I wanted to buy her an "I'm Busting The Hell Outta Here" outfit to wear once discharged.... The sweetest girl rang me up and somehow we got to talking about this situation... She not only went over and beyond with her actions and kind words, but also gave me a hug as I was getting misty-eyed.... She showed a true compassion for someone she had only known for two minutes.... I'm an ICU nurse, and as all my mothers issues have unfolded, I've been so busy trying to take care of my family...to have this girl hug me was just what I needed at that time...
I didn't catch her name, but I want to thank her... Thank you for being so kind... Thank you for the essential oils... My mother is SO excited to try them and was very touched by your actions...  We can't thank you enough...

Respectfully,
Mikayla and Terry

My 1st negative visit here.
I love Lulu tights and tops.
Will buy online from now on.
1. Sales gal shows me tops. When my sz wasnt available she just walked away. Never said hey let's see if we can get it elsewhere.
2. My fitting room was labeled with my name and then she disappeared . No follow up
3. Male sales associate said I was built like a.football player? WTH. I am 61 and 118 lbs runner.
I bought and ran away from these rude sales associates<//text>

Every time I shop at this Lululemon store, I have a wonderful experience!  Not only is there a pleasant atmosphere, they have a good selection in stock (and if they are out of your size or color they will order what you want and have it shipped directly to you - fast!) The staff goes above and beyond; attentive, helpful, and kind...but they're not "in your face" pushy!  I especially want to thank "Blair" for being such a sweet, wonderful, informative and helpful associate. Because of people like Blair - and her consistent genuine warmth - I will continue to shop here in person as well as over the phone when I cannot get to the store!  I'm a fan of  Lululemon Athletica, and I'm a fan of the crew at the Arden Fair Mall location.  I'm a very happy customer! Thanks!   :  )<//review>

Huge props to the employee Kiana Hood at the Arden Faire Mall.  She went above and beyond to handle a situation with a pair of pants.
She stayed on on top of this situation from beginning to end and was in contact with me every step of the way.  Kiana made me feel as if I were  her only customer.
Thank you Kiana!

<review>I frequent this unique place often since I enjoy the  special atmosphere that is part of this restaurant. The crew is highly cordial and skilfull. The service is extraordinarily quick. Also, the food they prepare is first-rate. I have been there many times and I was always delighted. The expense is fair. I suggest this place to my friends and family.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I have a lot of Filipino friends so I'm familiar with the foods and definitely a fan.  I came here for lunch on a Sunday and was seated right away.  I loved how their interior was decorated and that they had a live musician playing.< /Text>

Garlic fried rice was great, chicken adobo was great, bangus fish was great, even the side soup was great. Would definitely come back all the time if I lived in the area.

I call this special restaurant often because I enjoy the ambiance that is part of this place. The crew is very attentive and qualified. The service is certainly efficient. Needless to say, the food they serve is great. I frequent many times and I was never disappointed. The pay is decent. I highly recommend this place to all my friends.< /review>

<text>I had heard nothing but good things about this place from co-workers.  I was disappointed.  I ordered the grilled halibut steak.  It was dry and tasteless/plain. I would have been less disappointed were it not the priciest thing on the menu.  California Grill has better halibut.  The Fish Company has better halibut.  Mi Loreto in Loreto, BCS, Mexico has amazing halibut.  Then again it was caught hours before.  Lol.< /text>< Pictures>

Great service and delicious food.
I ordered the Salmon plate which comes with fried rice and coleslaw.  I also ordered a side salad and 8 fried shrimp to share with friends. The salmon did not smell or taste fishy, you know what that means, its Very fresh!
The staff all are friendly and kind.
Just be ready to pay cash only.
They also sale tiny mint chocolate squares for dessert.
There are many dishes to choose from.
They cook it when you order it, they are quick too.
UmI like this place< /review>

Great prices and always a good service. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because there are no public restrooms to use and the interior could use an upgrade.. but the food is one of the best quick sea food places in the area!<//text>< user>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>It's the best car buying experience I ever had when I purchased my used SUV at Journey West Motors Inc. in Colton, CA.
I'm a mother of 2 small, young children so I definitely needed a reliable SUV.  However, I have a limited amount of cash on hand. Staffs at Journey West Motors made it happen by introducing a 2009 Toyota Highlander. I was skeptical at first since it had about 100k on the millage. However, the car was thoroughly checked and it also came with Carfax showing only 1 owner.  The price was even $2,200 lower than Kelly Blue Book. I was very pleased to make the purchase since it haven't had any problem so far :), except oil changes and a set of new brake pad.
The most concern in buying a used car is don't know the car's history and its current condition. At Journey West Motors, they check the car and provide the Carfax so peace of mind's there. They also offer financing as well. Customer service is nice and knowledgeable to help you picking right car at the price that you can afford.
P.S I will post update condition of the SUV.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNY7X_A6ov6MZ3P4QXyLftl2VJmIs-erte7fTPD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNel19EdbdKZAws-3udin-QWt-AVWNycxIm2I0R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1532307761442, 'text': "Thank you Ngoc for your purchase and review. We hope you enjoy your Highlander. We do have over 100 units for our customers to choose from. I'm glad we found the right vehicle for you. Thanks again for everything.

<Review>Good prices on used cars, no B.S. about what you are getting for the price, no pressure about financing or upselling. The staff are very welcoming, friendly, and patient, even though we tried out six vehicles before we made our final decision. It was a much better experience than I was anticipating, and they will be my first choice the next time I need a car.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

{'time': 1532540108664, 'text': "We're happy to know that you enjoyed for experiences here with us. The extended warranty usually covers mechanical components of the vehicle. Unfortunately your regular battery is considered as routine maintenance (your hybrid battery was still under factory warranty for 10 years or 150,000 miles, whichever comes first). With that being said, please contact the office directly at (909) 639-9583 to discuss. We would love to provide any reasonable assistance to our customers. Thank you again for your input and purchase."}< /Response>

<text>Let me start by saying I enjoyed my experience here looking and purchasing a car. I would just say be cautious about buying a car here, like many small used car dealerships, they do not examine the cars they receive thoroughly. I bought a 2011 Ford Fusion Hybrid in Feb. 2018 and it ran well for the first 3 months. I purchased a 6 month warranty, but most things weren’t covered. The issue started with the battery and when I took it out to have it tested I noticed all kinds of things that weren’t good. I’m now having to fix those issues and it’s costing quite a bit..I’m currently trying to figure out how to post pictures on here to share with you all.</text></record>

<review>My experience with Calvin and Journey West Motors was excellent. After calling to make sure my intended vehicle was still on the lot, I arrived to find Calvin had the keys for it and a couple similar vehicles ready to go. He let me inspect and test drive them at my own pace and didn't follow me around or bother me. When I came back to his office to let him know I'd picked my 2007 Honda Accord, he asked if I'd taken it on the freeway yet. When I said I hadn't he encouraged me to because he wanted to make sure I'd fully tested the vehicle out. This instantly helped me know I was dealing with someone with integrity. I took it out and still loved it. The vehicle was in great condition and performed smoothly. The paperwork process was easy, Calvin didn't try to up-sell me on anything and even told me that while he was showing me optional support packages that he felt I did not need them. I have even called back with a question and despite owing me nothing he was very helpful. I had a truly pleasant experience and would recommend Journey West for a used vehicle. Calvin made it known that he purposely tries to only bring quality vehicles onto his lot and I believe him. My mechanic says that my Accord is in the best condition he's seen for a used car from a random lot. Visit Calvin and get a good used car!<//review>< Pics>

Looked online for about a week and found a good used car at this location (Corolla - right price, mileage, close to home and lots of history on the Carfax report) so I went a check it out.

Javier was great in letting me check what I needed to (brought my ODBII reader too) with nothing to hide. Went on a solo test drive on the freeway and streets (their insurance covers a 3mi radius).

Transaction with Calvin (owner) went smoothly (there is no haggling of the price). It said cash only so I brought cash, but can also pay with debit card or cashiers check.< /Review>

I purchased a Nissan here for my younger brother. Similar to the other reviewers, customer service was really great. My brother got the car for almost six months now and no problems so far except for basic maintenance. We knew the risks of buying a used car and they were upfront and honest with us about the condition of the car, which had over 100,000 miles.  Overall, we're very satisfied.</text>

We came in looking for an economical car for our daughter and Journey West Motors Inc. was the best place for us. Not only they have a huge selection of cars to choose from, they're really on top of their customer service experiences. After being helped with financing through their direct Credit Union, we were able to pick up our daughter's new car on that same day with zero down and a monthly payment less than $150. The purchase was very pleasant and staff was extremely helpful, yet, very professional.<//Review>

We purchased a Subaru Forester from Journey West and it runs like a champ. It was priced very reasonably and Calvin was a pleasure to work with. He went over all the noteworthy features and condition of the car with us before buying. Overall, the people at Journey West are friendly, easy-going, and knowledgable. Highly recommended for your next used car!<//Review>

This dealership pretty much only sells lower end cars. I see a lot of Toyota's and Honda's.  I picked up a Lexus at a pretty good deal. The car did have some minor cosmetic flaws but it's used and I paid less than 7 grand. Pretty good overall.< /review>

BUYER BEWARE. They tried selling me a Subaru with a serious mechanical problem (failing head gasket possibly). Checked the coolant level before driving (full), yet when the car ran it was leaking coolant from the tail pipe and had a small puddle under the motor. Claimed they weren’t aware of the problem...sure. Glad I spotted those issues, almost bought myself a lemon.<//text>

REIEW UPDATED 6 MONTH AFTER PURCHASE....................-ALL THIS BEFORE FIRST MONTH PAYMENT- I will share my experience purchasing a car here.I bought a 2006 Toyota Sienna with a 1 yr warranty.after 3 days the check engine line came on, i took it to them and was told it was a spark plug,3 days later same light and was told it was the coils and they were replaced.3 days later the same check engine light and I took it again to the dealer were I was told they will change the coils again.3 days later and now a 4th visit back to the dealer and I was told that at this point it was probably a bigger issue than coils or spark plugs and that I should check with warranty company and keep them informed so they can help mediate the situation if I needed help. I Called the warranty company was given an appointment to drop my vehicle off a week later to their mechanic. Now without a car to take my kids to school for another week I kept thinking positive and realize things like this could happen to anyone. At this point i needed a car ASAP and was considering going back to dealer to finance another car for my wife so we can get by while they fixed the van. I called a total of 5 times in a span of 8 days. First talked to the wife of owner and ask if she could have her husband call me, didn’t mention why I was calling or anything, she said he was at an auction will let him know to call me and never returned my call. I called again 3 times in the next 3 days and was told on all 3 occasions that they’ll let him know I called, never returned my calls. A week later I was finally called back from mechanic who told me my bill was going to be $360 dollars for all the parts the warranty didn’t cover, I told him I was in the “Drive with No worries”policy and was in the understanding that all parts and labor were covered.He said no,They only cover major components and your dealership should have told you that.Also the engine was notably way louder like a lawnmower and was told that normal.I saw this was a lost case and paid the amount. I called the dealership to see if i could talk to owner again and spoke to a lady who asked what was in regards to and i explained the situation to her, she told me she would have the owner call me when he came in from the auction he was at.She did call me back and ask if i could email the bill I had to pay at mechanic so that she can show to owner and see if they can do something about that.I ask her, So does this mean he’s not going to give me a call?she said they will return y call when he came in. It has been 4 days since and still no word from them. I gotta say I’m very disappointed by this place.I gave $4200 down on the first vehicle and if i had not purchased a warranty for an extra $600 or so I would have been asked completely out of a car and money. I would just say be careful when buying a car here, and advice anyone buying a car to make sure you can find a place to give you at least a week warranty no matter how good the car is or how they tell you car-fax report shows no issues, if the car is that good you’ll be confident on giving your customers a 1 week warranty for peace of mind.In conclusion,Yes you get great amazing and friendly customer service while they are selling you a vehicle.But for some reason i can’t understand they showed poor business practice towards my situation.I gave them time before writing my review at least to call me back or return my calls?Hope this helps anyone make a educated purchase. I HAVE SINCE THEN SPEND ABOUT 1500 ON OTHER FIXTURES.I left several messages to the dealer to contact me but they failed to do so.<//text>

< Review>
I went in for a Corolla but ended up purchasing a Sentra instead. It was priced $1600 below CarGurus pricing comparisons and $2500 under Kelly Blue Book. They provide Carfax report for every car I looked at. Customer service was great. The sales ladies are very courtious and knowledgeable. The warranty options were good also. My Sentra had brand new tires, brakes, all new fliuds, shampooed interior. It's been five months now and no problems whatsoever, just routine maintenance. Highly recommending this dealership.< /Review>

The reason I am reading this a four is because of FRANCO. I dropped my keys behind a counter that was filled to a wall. I was juggling 4 packages and a 5 y.o. at my side.  Needless to say, it was stuck.  Everyone else was rude and inconsiderate. The first women I told at the counter rolled her eyes. I even had to call the cops when they told my they couldn't do anything on a Saturday which is a lie because they have emergency maintenance. Once the cops came  then the lady started changing her tone. I told. them that those were my house andcar keys and I didn't even live in this county and I had my little one with me. They didn't care.Franco was the only one who  tried as hard as he could until maintenance came. Which was 1.5 hours.<//review>

SHAWNEE OR SHAUNIE.
The women who lied about being the supervisor was completely rude, condescending, and horrible. She constantly interrupted me when I talked, always spoke with an attitude and had the nerve to hang up on me. She is beyond disrespectful and rude. I am so sorry you are such a low life and a loser that you have to take out your miserable life on other people. Learn how to treat people with respect you piece of s h i t</Review>

I don’t rate post offices because, well why would I? I drop packages off at post offices throughout LA & IE and the staff was quick and friendly while they worked on the ridiculously long line. One postal worker showed me how to get a receipt with the self service machine for my drop off allowing me to bypass most of the line. Thank you.<//Text>

Democrats claim that there is no Ballot mail fraud, yet with a rating of 1.6, I'm supposed to trust their unbiased proffessionalism when election is a month away and I still haven't received my absentee ballot that I receive every year.  ... I have already reached out to AMAZON and demanded they no longer ship my orders USPS because my carrier will mark "attempted to deliver" even though I'm home literally sitting by the front door; Because they didn't want to bother with delivering my package on time. (This actually happened multiple times, but once over a three day holiday, I literally waited till the following week for shoes I'd ordered for that very weekend) Another time my ex had ordered some earnings. The tracking claimed they had been delivered. After a week she finally went down to the office a threw a fit. Guess what was nestled in the carriers personal locker. In short my carrier is a piece of sh...
But don't worry.
I'll be mailing my ballot Fed EX.<//Text>

They apparently attempted delivery at 7:23am, never rang the doorbell and the slip saying we could just go pick it up instead was left in the mailbox not on the porch. I question whether they even went to the porch. We filed for redelivery confirmed for the next day. No package. No slip. I even left a note on the door to ring the doorbell. Apparently if we want our package we have to wait until Saturday when we can get there instead of them doing their actual job and delivering it on Monday. The call center is zero help, they just say to go pick it up. We aren't paying to ship things ALMOST to the destination!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

There was a very rude person there (clerk 11). I was shipping a book and she kept asking “ are you sure it is a book” like 10 times. She was very rude and acted like she is just waiting to be done. Do not recommend this place if she is working there.</text>

Honestly management is what’s wrong with the post office.  They take things personally aren’t understanding what so ever.  They think they know it all yet never have actual done mail before.  They need to seriously treat their employees better at both locations in corona, especially those that actually do a great job.</text>

<Review>Marie B is unprofessional. I am mailing out a package and I didn't know there was a "Registered Mail" as an option for my package. She told me I should have let her know. I found out because it was on the payment screen, so I asked what is "Registered Mail". If I known I would have mentioned it, so I don't have to get out and fill out the paperwork again and get back in line, even if I am going in front of the line. Really poor customer service. This USPS needs to be close or retrain the employees on better customer service skills.</Review><Name>Jenny Men< /Name>< Response>

The older lady tellers are sarcasric rude and waste your time. They need retraining in reading situations that some people might be in a hurry and need to get in and out. Stop with all the upsales and add ons. I told you what i need to do period! Lets move along now.< /Text>

<text>Last Saturday in the early morning, my neighbor knocked at my front door. He handed me with two packages because he found them in an opened mail box in the mid night so he took them to me. Such a nice guy!
The situation was the mailman wrongly put the key into another neighbor's mailbox, fortunately that neighbor left the stuff inside the mail box rather than took them away. It was not the first time while my mails/packages were carried to me by neighbors, which meant my mails were frequently sent to wrong addresses. I really want to file a complain against the mailman to his supervisor. Can someone give me the link?

Sadly these reviews won’t do anything but none the less I’m in a new home and already had a package delivered to someone else when clearly our address was correct on it! Thankfully our neighbor returned it to us! USPS is lazy when delivering and no accountability! Same issue at the one off California constantly not delivering right and my stuff was stolen and they did nothing to rectify the situation!< /text>

I would give them no stars if I could. Some of these people don't deserve to work anywhere because of their lack of customer service. I went in to get assistance with an issue of someone opening my mail and to call their lack of service an exemplary example of horrible customer service isn't enough. Absolutely ridiculous lack of service and its pathetic that they are not held accountable for their horrible service.<//text>

The old lady staff was discriminated me and my boyfriend. It was my first time buying a stamp, required by the embassy, but i was confused by the embassy’s instruction so i asked her to help me read the instruction written in ENGLISH. She didn’t even take a look or provide me with a little help. Besides that, she hastily replied me “I DON’T READ CHINESE.” I gently replied, “I IS ENGLISH.” ... and all I expected was her apology but nothing came out of her mouth except “read it to me.”</text>

<Text>I've lived in my house for 2-1/2 years now. Initially, my carrier would leave packages on the porch, as expected (just like UPS and FedEx), but soon after, she started leaving them in a front planter. I figured it was just so they'd be less visible from the street. However, I have sprinklers in that planter, and if I don't happen to see the package, it gets soaked. They even put them there in the rain!  For the past few deliveries, she's been leaving packages in another planter about 20 feet from my front door. If I don't know about a delivery (by a tracking email for instance), I'd never see it there. What's next - is she going to start leaving them by the curb since it's more convenient for her?  And calling the post office is useless - the phone has been ringing now for over 6 minutes! They truly don't answer their phones!  They should be ashamed of the piss poor service they provide, all the while raising postage rates.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

I have never had such horrible experience at a post office! I have never had an issue using a company business card especially while wearing the company logo on my uniform. I was then given the run around about who the supervisor was and when he was available. My assistant manager has never had an issue using the card with them before but with she (Sonia) refused.</text>

<review>My first experience with this location. Called to find out about passport hours. No answer. Got there about noon only to find out they were not taking any more people because the guy goes to lunch at 1:30. So basically if you need a passport don't arrive past 11:30. Why is there no one to cover during the lunch break?
update: went in again at an earlier time and was seen pretty quickly. Benny at the passport window was friendly, fast and efficient. He made the entire process a breeze.  While I was not happy about making a second trip I was very happy with the service.</review>< Pictures>

If there were a lower rating than a one star, I would give them a lower rating.  These employees are lazy and don't give a damn about the customers.  I spoke to a manager by the name of Alex.  He confirmed what I already knew about this post office.  He was rude and told me that once they have attempted to deliver a package than if you want the post office to attempt to deliver again, you must call and ask them.  I paid them extra to have it deliver a certain date.  This doesn't make sense.  No wonder this place us so messed up, it starts at the top.  Alex doesn't have a clue what's customer service is.  I hope the Government puts the US Postal Service out of business.  To all of you who work at this location.  Please don't be surprise!</text>

They are actually horrible mail carriers my package was the same status for a week like how is it not gonna get scanned more than once in a hole week it’s first class mail and on top of that   I had to wait three days to get ahold of some one i know that there’s a crisis and all but that doesn’t mean customer service should go down the drain.< /Review>

Trying to get an update on my package. They have two lines but don't say what they are for. So I waited in one and was then told to go to the other one. Waited in that line. When I got called she told me to go to the kiosk 4ft away and print out the status so she could see the numbers. I said can't you just look at my phone or i can read it to you. "No" she replied. So I printed it out and went to the back of the line again. I got called again and she was helpful this time. She looked for the package but couldn't find it. She said she would call me later today. They need to invest in some simple signs.< /review>

<Text>Went to get a Money order for my rent for $1,500 I swipe my debit card and it declines. The lady tried it again as Credit still declined! I check to see if chase put a fraud prevention on my account by email because they will send me an email always and nope no email. So I have no choice to go to chase bank and ask why they are not allowing my debit to go through. Teller at chase says it’s not us it’s the USPS!!! So I just get a money order from chase because I’m there already. Then the next month which is December I go back to post office to try to get a money order for my rent AGAIN, well same thing happens and I know I have more than enough in my bank account and I told the same lady this is the second month this happens she reply’s it’s ur bank u probably have a spending limit! I said yes it’s $3,000 per day and this is only 1,500 money order. I was frustrated and told her something is wrong with their debit card system with these amounts because I have the money and I’m putting in my pin and chase said it’s not on their end! She was adamant it was not their fault !!! Annoying so I had to go to bank AGAIN and get a money order! Has anyone else had these same issues?</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I don't think anybody even read this from the USPS. well I called in to a machine asking her to hold my package at the local post office.. I went to the post office and they said that they delivered the package. When I told her about the hold, she simply said we didn't hold it. They don't  care what customer service is. What's the point for me to call in to request for the hold.</text>

<text>Very rude attitude from the clerks. They could not find my International package, no one even apologized about this, just saying very officially like " we will contact you when we find it", but it was already 2 weeks and I been here over twice. I was like a tennis ball to be kicked from one to another, the latest was someone helped me then saying ok it was not me helped u so someone will help u in the other line, then I just be switched to the other line, and I Clearly Heard that they were talking about: what u want to do with this / (to me) ? Then the other clerk just said they will contact me when they find it with very unpleasant face and tone. And when I asked what if they lost it? She said u have to call 800 service but it should after 30 days. Then I left. Plus, at the very first time in first week I been to there, the clerk forgot to give the pink sheet back to me. Jesus ! That was an International Package!!!!</text>< GmapID>

I'm going to update this later. But I'll leave this here for now. *updating now cause of quick and great customer service.*

Most of the customers here aren't the best. They're stupid, entitled, impatient, expect to be babied and extort service out of the workers here. While in line one of the workers went out of her way to shorten the line by taking people who were here for drop offs and other quick services out of the line. I was one of them. Before me were a few rude customers that didn't accept clear consice instructions to them. They even interrupted her helping out other people. Another got her package stuck in a bin she had no business putting it in cause she felt she was too good for the line. And then she felt she could halt everything to accommodate to her bs.

If you come here. Don't be an ass, have your stuff ready. And don't block the drive area so you can finish your text or whatever else.</text>

Three times this past two weeks, we had problems. One, the package was delivered to the wrong house. They investigated and found out about it after we told them what was going on with the package. The package said it was already delivered, but we never got it. Turns out, they gave it to one of our neighbors, who of course didn't give it back.
Two, yesterday, I went to check the mail and we had important mail delivered to us that wasn't ours. Didn't want to read it. It was green and I had to walk all the way down the cul de sac to give it to the right person.
Lastly, today, when I went to get mail around 12pm, they gave us wrong mail again. It was from Social Security Administration. I had to put it back in the box to return it. The address is way off. Learn to double check or triple check. 😑 Do you have any idea how bad and CARELESS you're getting with mail? You could've JEOPARDIZED and COMPROMISED someone's privacy and security. Especially, with the holidays coming up, theft is bad enough already. Get your act together and shape up ASAP.< /review>

This USPS is very unproductive and they claim no responsibility for their mistakes. They only attempted to deliver my priority mail package once, and marked my package to be sent back to the sender. They left a note on my front door saying my package may be picked up after 8:30am 6/27, and when I went to pick it up, they couldn't locate my package. I went later during the day to check in again, and the same worker looked for it again, and finally told me that the item had been sent back to the sender. USE UPS OR FEDEX because USPS is completely unreliable.<//text>

I have not received mail even though I put in a change 3 weeks ago.  Tried to call for hours yesterday, they don't answer the phone. Drove down and they couldn't explain why I wasn't getting my mail and they didn't have any in the back. A supervisor said she would check with the carrier on my mail/packages and she would call me. Still haven't heard a word from her. Maybe my mail will mysteriously appear in next few days. Maybe not. Don't want to deal with them again. Their customer service stinks.< /Review>

This has got to be the worst post office I've ever been to. No one seems to want to help you here and don't bother calling no one ever answers the phone I let it ring and ring on multiple occasions no answer ever! The mailman just randomly stops putting mail in my mailbox I had a priority package I was tracking they never delivered it nor did they update the tracking to let me know it was being held not even a note! I try to call that was a joke. Then I go down there stand in line then I'm told I'm in the wrong line I need to go into the pickup line so then I had to stand in another long line. I asked why my mail wasn't being delivered she said she didn't know and the mailman was new. I had to leave my job to go figure all this mess out. If I could give this place a negative I would!</Text>

My package was upgraded to One-Day Priority Mail and was being delivered to my business, only problem was that it was now supposed to be delivered on Saturday. Went to this Post Office to pick it up because my business was closed on Saturday and the lady who was helping me said that because of packages being scheduled to be delivered on weekends to closed businesses was a common occurrence, they don't give people their packages until Monday because, "It's an inconvenience and we have to go searching through a big pile of returned packages in the back," (Her exact words). She went to look for it after I asked to speak with the Post Master and then comes back and tells me all this was for nothing because I was at the wrong location to begin with. VERY DISSAPPOINTED</text>

Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. I've had multiple packages delivered to the wrong house, and the USPS FOLDED MY MASTERS DEGREE IN HALF when the envelope clearly said "do not fold" in bold, red letters. Yesterday, I received a notification from Amazon that my package was delivered, yet it was not... I have been calling the postal office all morning and NO ONE is picking up the phone. I want to ensure that my packages make it to my door today, yet no one will answer the phone.<//text>

<review>Awful. Absolutely  awful. And make sure not to annoy them because if you get put on hold then you might as well hang up because they aren't coming back to you. I've been very happy in corona until I tried to have my packages delivered. A Mr. Silvas tried to tell me my package was stolen, but when I informed him I was home when I got the tracker email that my package had arrived he "put me on hold".  Absolutely  awful.</review>< resp>

EVERYTIME I expect a package to be delivered, they ALWAYS leave a note saying "business closed"-we have a FULL parking lot of cars and over 20 employees at any given time-WHY doesn't the lazy driver GET OUT of the car and DELIVER our packages??!! I have LITERALLY CALLED 10 times to complain about this exact situation, I will check the status of my package online, and INEVITABLY it will say it couldnt be delivered when I have been sitting here waiting for it the ENTIRE TIME, when I call them about it I ALWAYS get TONS of attitude, and have to wait around for the guy to come back with my delivery. GET.IT.TOGETHER!!!<//Review>

This is the second time that they have lost my package that they were supposed to deliver and they did not. I have gone to the post office several times and they tell me they will call me which they never did.I asked to talk to a supervisor and they told me he was not in so they gave his phone number to me to call and after several days of calling and leaving messages he never answered or called back so I finaly gave up and I never received my packages
This post office is a joke and we need to call who ever is in charge of this so called post office and see if he will do something or if he is just as dumb as them< /Text>

For reason we don't get packages, the tracking shows as "undeliverable as addressed".
I was sitting in a chair by the front door when this message was posted on the tracking. The mailman isn't even trying to make the delivery... Very dissatisfied with the service we are receiving.
We live in Eastvale Just south of Limonite, and have previously been receiving many packages without any issue.

We haven't received mail in two days, so I have been trying to call the number listed and of course there is no answer.  We always get mail, every day, even if it's junk so I know nothing has been delivered.  Now I can't even get anyone to answer the phone down there to find out what is going on.

Worst experience ever!!  Package tracking sends message saying package couldn't be delivered because business is closed.  Funny because it is supposed to be delivered to my HOUSE!! Tried to call, get an 800 number and have to wait on hold for about 30 minutes, the lady gives me a phone number to call for my "local" post office but she doesn't give me my local one she gives me Mira Loma, I call the 800 number back but now it's an HOUR wait!!  The Mira Loma office gave me the local number but of course no one even bothers to answer!!!< /review>

I had several packages said they were delivered according to tracking and not got the packages. Thought someone was stealing them but I can’t rule out them putting them in the wrong mailbox because at least twice a week I have someone elses mail in my mailbox< /Text>

Just reiterating what everyone here has said, lost packages, unanswered calls, multiple mail mixups with neighbors, just awful service. Can't believe our tax dollars fund such ineptitude.< /Review>

<review>Very poor. I don't understand how this postal location can get so many 1 star negative reviews and management has done nothing about it. I rarely ever give poor ratings to any type of business but with this postal location it is unavoidable.

I've been very patience on waiting for my package, that has not arrive, 3 days from expected delivery day. According to the online tracking, it was out for delivery from this location then banish. Last status, "delivery status not updated".

After calling multiple times through out the business day. Not one call was answered. So I simply went to the post office to speak to a rep. Sure enough I got the run around and the package was not there... According to my tracking status it arrived, was received, and sorted by this location then disappeared. Upon leaving all I was given was the number to the supervisor. I called ... *at this point I don't even know why I bother to write this review, only to warn the public locals and hopefully this is read by upper management.* ... The supervisor answered sure enough no help or assurance at all. So what considered this my lost on a $100+ plus ordered package? Dissapointed.<//review>< pictures>

I wish I could give zero stars and put the picture of a dead, rain-bloated gutter rat instead. This post office is full of vindictive middle-aged washouts getting their revenge on the world by letting their phone ring forever (just to get disconnected eventually) and by sticking you on hold for hours while they pick their belly buttons and piss and moan to each other about their miserable, boozy lives. They've malevolently instructed their carriers to let the world burn and to never EVER deliver the correct mail to the correct recipient (except for our regular mail guy whose name I unfortunately cannot remember). In fact, the reason I'm taking the time to type this bitter diatribe is due to the fact that the substitute carrier today left all five cluster boxes hanging wide open at my apartment community. What's worse is I suspect he isn't even human; instead he's an amalgamation of junk mail ads for Botox and the coagulated embodiment of the Corona Post Office's gathered contempt for society. He is fueled by the blood of burst capillaries in the frustrated foreheads of a thousand local residents. This godless establishment yields to no pleas for mercy, no appeal to reason. If their wicked dystopia is ever to be fully realized, we will have no choice but to resort to scribbled notes and pigeons. Damn the United States Postal Service located at 414 W. Grand Blvd. in Corona, CA. Damn them all.</text>

Anytime I order a package and it goes through USPS, it’s never delivered on time. You can call this location several times and they never pick up. Many of my packages have gone mising and most days, I don’t receive my mail. I do not like this location whatsoever. They are lazy, they never take responsibility, and they are rarely helpful.<//text>

Every time I deal with this Post Office it's a nightmare. It is nearly impossible to get through by phone. Scheduled pick ups online , driver never shows. The United Postal Service wonders why they are losing millions every year. ....SHUT IT DOWN . If a public company was to lose as much as the USPS every year they would have closed the doors a long time ago.</Text>

The mail carriers are an utter disappointment. In the past year, there have been over 20 instances where someone else's mail has appeared in my mailbox, and there have been over 5 instances where my incoming packages were marked as delivered but were nowhere to be seen. Who knows how many of my letters without tracking numbers never made it to me.</Review>

They have messed up my deliveries not once or twice three time. They put someone else package in my mailbox and my package on someone else. This is getting ridiculously annoying and I am tired of telling them over and over again. It's a shame that they have no respect or responsibilities towards costumers.<//review>

If you come in at a decent time you can get seen very fast. Try to come when it’s not busy, near 5pm. Also, very nice lady. This was my first pedicure ever and it was incredible. The lady was very nice to me and didn’t make me feel like I had to know everything. She was very thorough with the questions on what I wanted. Also I have a nail that is broken and she filled it in! She did an amazing job on my feet! I recommend going. The only downside is the customers, they can get a little unruly, but nothing too bad.<//Review>

Really good customer service. We went in the morning so it wasn’t busy and they attended us pretty quickly. I got a pedi and acrylics, I love my nails I think the lady who did mine was Ivy she was so quick about it. You can tell she’s been doing this for a long time. But she did exactly what I wanted, besides that it was good. She did go ham on my nails when she was filing them LOL that it kinda hurt, but it was great overall. I love them !</text>

They are not very professional and use illegal
MMA acrylic. my natural nails look terrible and are in tremendous pain. Taking them off is almost impossible, they can not be soaked off and will definitely have to be forced off potentially taking some of your real nail with it.<//Review>

<review>If you’re looking for a place to get a fast pedicure your in the right one
But if looking for a nice and relaxing foot massage and scrubbing skip this place not worth paying for extra service when they only scrub the 🦶for 5 second
And customer service is just blah 😒< /review><UserId.>117262426453399453799</UserId.>< gmapID>

VERY DISGUSTING PLACE. THEY DO DOUBLE DIP THEIR WAX WHICH CAN LEAD TO INFECTIONS. IVY ALSO TRIED TO USE A DIRTY RAZOR TO CLEAN UP MY EYEBROWS. ALSO DO NOT USE YOUR CARD HERE!! MY EYEBROW AND GEL ACRYLICS CAME UP TO $41. WHEN I LEFT I SEEN A CHARGE OF $51 DOLLARS. IVY GAVE HERSELF A $10 TIP WITHOUT MY  Authorization!!  When they drop tools on the ground they do not clean and disinfect they put it back in their Box. DISGUSTING.< /Text>

<text>I was always going to Ivy. But she has a terrible attitude. She’s not friendly at all. Nails not the same length and thick around the cuticle, hanging acrylic under the nail. Not to mention they use ILLEGAL mma. This is stuff that is used in the medical field for crown bridges and only use it after it’s dried. It drastically weakens the nail and it becomes attached to your natural nail making it almost impossible to remove them without pulling up your own nails. Not to mention I was having numbness in my fingers and upon research MMA can cause numbness in the fingers. TERRIBLE PLACE. My natural nails are RUINED</text><user_id>113597797415906501495</user_id><Time>1548507694027</Time><username>Ambrosia Jalisse</username>< Rating>

Worst place the men that work there have the worst attitude. I did my nails there and they left them too thick in the front, not enough nail polish around the nail, and when i told the guy fix it he had an attitude. Two of my nails he made them crook it and would not fix them he said they were already like that.  Wow!!!
I don't recommend this place to anyone.
You'll be throwing your money away.

Worst place ever the prices is something different then what they post. They charge you to scrub your feet false advertising. No equipment to dry nails or feet. Place didn't look that clean but I guess I get what I paid for never again! My feet got messed up soon as I left parking lot SMH.</Review>

Here visiting out of town...this was the closest nail shop so i thought let me give them a try...i sit down to get manicure/pedicure.....she barely doing a good job...AND SLOW.... and barely speak english...she motioned to scrub my feet and I answered yes....NEVER MENTIONING THIS IS CONSIDERED A CALLOUS REMOVER( she literally just rubbed the thing across my feet...never removed a callous-WHICH I DON'T HAVE)....be careful when their mumbling things to you.....because when you go to pay for your service it will be more!!!

I also had to ask the girl to apply a base coat before applying my polish!! They use tissue to separate your toes and they dnt use dryers to dry you toenails- she actually used a price menu to fan my toes and nails

BAD SERVICE AND SERVICE AND SERVICE!!!!!!!!<//Review>

Eleven years ago I got a solar system from Solar City/Tesla.  The inverter never worked correctly and it had to be repaired or replaced 12 times in 10 years.  Since they refused to extend my expiring warranty, I searched for other companies that would give me a reliable system.  Solar Watt listened to me and worked to update my system with a reliable inverter.  The cost was reasonable and  feel that I can finally be confident about my production.  I've found them to be an honest business.<//text>

Solar Watt Solutions is the most honest solar company out there.  Honesty is the foundational cornerstone of everything they do, and they really go the extra mile to make sure everything is done with excellence the first time.  If you are considering solar, do yourself a favor and call them - you will not be disappointed.  Integrity.  Peace of mind.  Highly Recommended.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Solar Watt Solutions is the real deal.  We transitioned to solar in 2012.  One of the smarter things we have done.  We interviewed several companies.  Some of which were clowns.  Dave presented our options clearly without pressure so we could make an informed decision.  As a small business owner ourselves, all we were looking for was a company that offered a quality product, at a fair price and stood behind their word.  Now 2020 I can confirm that Solar Watt Solutions does all of those.  Since our system install 8 years ago, we have referred Solar Watt Solutions to several friends that inquired about our experience and added them into their mix of quotes.  All of which ultimately went with Solar Watt Solutions and communicated how impressed and happy they were with their experience.  We also expanded our solar system to increase production to accommodate a "geo electric water heater" converting from propane hot water heater.  Another smarter thing we have done.  But the real reason for posting this review now after 8 years is that after the succession of heavy storms that we experienced this winter we experienced a leak under a panel section.  Hey it happens.  With no question Dave sent out his crew and remedied the situation promptly and professionally standing behind their warranty.  I generally do not post reviews.  If your in the market for solar you need to include Solar Watt Solutions them in your fact finding quote mix......the rest will take care of itself.</Text>< pics>

Our very good friends in Vista recommended SolarWattSolutions, they went with Dave eight years ago and the service is still awesome.  We went to them and the process was easy and quick.  We really appreciate the great service Dave and his folks provide. We live in San Diego (Mission Hills) and have 10 panels on our roof.  Thank you Dave.< /Text>

<review>I had a CoolPV system installed in November and was impressed with the professionalism of everyone I dealt with, including the installation teams.   But, I  wanted to wait until now for my review so that I  could honestly report on the Pool Heating and Solar Energy production combined.  I am happy to say that my Pool Heating is working perfectly  and that I am producing the Solar Energy that I expected to or more.   This is a great company to do business with and I couldn't be happier.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

At the end I made the decision to go with Solar Watt Solutions. The process was made very simple and provided me with all the answers to my questions and concerns. The biggest thing was their honesty about the entire system and process. I live in Murrieta and that was not a problem for them since they work in all the San Diego and riverside areas. My main concern was getting the process started before the end of the year and I am happy to say they even beat the deadline. The system was completed in November and I wanted to wait before I put my review to see if the system is functioning to the capacity that they said it would. Well, I am happy to say it is doing better than I expected.

<Rate>5<//Rate><Date>1572030911223< /Date><Text>I just went live with my Solar Watts Solution's installed solar system (4.8 Kw). I am very happy with it.
From the begging, my sales representative Ollie was taking an excellent care of me. The company closely listened to my needs and wishes. Watts Solutions was always very willing to adjust and customize my system. Ollie worked with me through all my options in the deepest detail until I fully understood my best choice.
My install was fairly involved. From replacing my old roof, changing the old main electric panel, installing a new level 2 EV car charger to digging a trench to the street to support my new solar system, the company took an excellent care of all the aspects of the entire install. Everything went smoothly. The install was hands off for me. Watts solution handled everything end to end. I highly recommend using their services. You will not be just a customer, Watts Solutions is a true partner that will guide you and help you make the right choices during your solar journey.<//Text><userid>114924075940170243596< /userid>< Name>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>Dave is by far one of the most upstanding business owners I’ve had the pleasure to do (or not do business with).  I bought a home that had solar panels already installed and noticed a leak in my house.  I called a roofer and they said it was from the solar panels and that it would be best to find a solar company that could come take a look.  Dave was referred many time on my Nextdoor app so I reached out.  He was so great!  Answered all my questions and was totally honest and said it would be best if I could really find who installed them because there is a 10 year warranty on solar panels/installation.

Thanks to him I really made an effort to find the company and that put the panels on.  They came out and checked the leak and I was a little skeptical of the backpedaling I was hearing.  I immediately called Dave for his advice.  He’s honest and trustworthy and I would recommend him to anyone and everyone who wants solar.</review>< date>

Outstanding service from start to finish.  We purchased a home in April that had solar system, but a broken inverter.  The inverter was under warranty but the previous installer that installed the solar system for the previous owner was no longer in business so we contacted Solar Watt Solutions to replace the inverter.  Even though this was a small job they got me up and running and provided outstanding customer service throughout the whole process.  Would highly recommend!< /Text>

We got solar through Solar Watt Solutions and we are saving big on our electric bill. Dave was very thorough and made sure that we would be able to generate all of our electricity from our panels but would still have room to grow (ie add AC or an electric car) if we need more electricity. The installation was fast. They are honest and trustworthy. Highly recommend for anyone looking for solar in Carlsbad and North San Diego County.< /review>

<review>If you are looking for a trustworthy company look no further!  They were recommended to us by some friends and we are so glad they did.  We interviewed 5 total companies and they were the clear winner.  They were very transparent, answered all of our questions and put us at ease about the whole process.  Ollie didin't try to "sell" us solar he helped us to make our home more efficient.  This was not what I experienced with  the other 4 companies we interviewed.  They all had a clear motive and it was a waste of our time. Choose Solar Watt, you won't be disappointed! Everyone from Solar Watt has been fantastic.  My husband said the installation team was fantastic, and he does not give praise easily.  This was an easy choice for us to make.  They truly are a 5 star company!< /review>< Pics>

We highly recommend Solar Watt Solutions. Every aspect of our solar system purchase and installation was flawless. Despite being in the middle of the COVID-19 Pandemic, our systems was up and running ahead of schedule. We’re the third household within our family to go with Solar Watt Solutions.<//review>

Dave, Jim, Steve and the crew were fantastic every step of the way. The communication, pricing, and service are absolutely top notch, and I could not give a higher recommendation to Solar Watt Solutions.

Do your research and you will see that Solar Watt goes a step further. For one, they did an honest assessment of our needs and sold us an appropriately-sized system, unlike a couple of other companies we spoke to. Second, they installed a Level 2 charging station and paid to have the warranty extended, making the entire solar/charging system warrantied for 25 years. Third, they recommended a roofing company they partner with that was stellar (Adan Cruz Roofing).

Finally, the entire process, from signing the contract to SDG&E approving and turning on the system was 52 days, including an entire roof installation. And this was during the holidays!

Thank you, Solar Watt Solutions, for a great experience!< /text>

<text>We interviewed several companies that included referrals & others from our own research.  After meeting with Jim, it was clear that we were speaking with the most knowledgeable representative.  Other companies recommended more panels at a higher cost but Jim explained it wouldn't be necessary which in turn saved us thousands.  In addition, Solar Watt offered the panels & installation at a lesser cost than anyone else we interviewed.  Everything was coordinated seamlessly & we appreciate everything Solar Watt offered to help us with our needs.  Highly recommend this company!!!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Review>Home project that involve contractors are rarely smooth.  There typically seems to be a hang up with materials, weather, a crew has to be put on an emergency job, etc.  Well, working with Solar Watt, none of this was the case. The work was done on time and they were flexible with a couple of our requests and made the whole experience extremely positive and smooth.  I do not hesitate recommending them for solar.< /Review>< Pictures>

As an electrical engineer I waited to purchase a solar power system until I found Solar Watt Solutions. I have kept pace with the developments in the solar power products, the local San Diego solar systems contractors, power company incentives  and tax based rebate programs over the years. My tipping point came about after meeting with  the system designers and engineers at Solar Watt Solutions.
I had all my reservations of timing my system purchase addressed honestly and with many verifiable facts from industry website sites and watchdog organizations supplied to me by Solar Watt Solutions.
I was made aware of Solar Watt Solutions through multiple respected sources, most of whom were customers. Colleagues in the construction trades also had very good things to say about Solar Watt Solutions. They have their own crews install all of their systems. They are a small cadre of professionals with pride of workmanship. Their system designers have years of product and system knowledge and can claim prowess well above that of their competitors and would be “ professionals”.
They are a small company whom is pacing their growth and concertedly planning their marketing plan. They do not advertise. Their  sharp penciled personalized system prices do not include ANY additional costs built into them for advertising. Call this company after you have been assaulted and marketed into mind numbing product confusion and sticker shock. They will can and will educate you if you want and give sources to research, if you need that. They also treat you and your home with respect. Be forewarned... you’re gonna love ‘em!!<//Text>

We hired Solar Watt Solutions a couple of years ago to install solar panels for our home.  They were knowledgable and helpful in choosing the right panels for our electrical demands.  We have contacted them only a few times since installation, and they were quick to respond to our questions. I would recommend Solar Watt Solutions to anyone interested in installing solar panels in their home or business.< /text>

We have nothing but good things to say about Solar Watt solutions! Choosing a solar contractor is a very daunting task because of the sheer amount of competition and many in this industry use aggressive sales tactics, including badmouthing their competition and claiming superiority in a way that only they can measure. Meeting with Andrew for the initial consultation was very easy, he came to our house at a time that was convenient for us, gave us enough information for us to realize he understood our needs, but at the same time, he did not overextend his welcome trying to rush us into a hasty decision. The installation staff lead by Octavio were absolutely amazing! Very polite, did an outstanding job, worked hard, worked fast and made sure we knew what was installed on the roof and in the garage. We own a 2-story house in Carlsbad and these people are expert ladder climbers! They are able to carry a solar panel on their shoulder faster than we can climb up our staircase. Some of their local competitors have a mandatory crane installation that cost over $2,000 per day alone, but these people know what they are doing. Our system was installed very fast, and activated within days after an easy inspection with the city and verification from SDGE. Our system is already producing more energy than expected, and it comes with app monitoring via the SolarEdge app that gives real time and historical data. We are very happy we were diligent in finding the right company to install our solar panels and highly recommend Solar Watt Solutions!</text>

<text>Would recommend to anyone! I wish I had got my solar installed with them first. I had a lot of issues with first company that installed my solar and was not happy with their service and Solar Watt Solutions helped me resolve all the issues and now I'm a happy camper! Thanks to them I'm now able to save on my solar and get the service that was promised.</text></record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>We recently decided to check into solar and after meeting Jim with Solar Watt solutions we were extremely impressed. We actually vetted 2 other companies and by far Solar Watt Solutions system, warranty  and technology was superior. We use the CoolPV Solar Panels - which uses thermal heat from the panels to heat our pool.
We have been very pleased with every aspect of our installation process -- They were very upfront and professional. Dave has also been great to work with . Everything went exactly as they promised.
We have had our system for a short time, but are extremely happy.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Solar Watt Solutions was an absolute joy to work with all the way around and they deserve the highest rating available. Even now that the system is installed and operating, I’m still in a bit amazed at  how seamless the whole process went with absolutely none of the “common” contractor delay/horror stories.
We live in Valley Center and had quoted 5 different companies for the 18 panel job. The Solar Watt Sales team was very responsive, professional and the quote was received the same day!  Even after discussing a few variations including number of panels, different manufacturers and controllers, each time the updated quote was received very quickly.  This happened with no one else, and in fact I needed to call two other companies to ask when I could expect the quote.  Pricing was very good and they never asked for an upfront fee. Only after the system was turned on and accepted by SDG&E, was payment requested.  Further, they were able to improve upon the original installation date and when it came time to install, they actually upgraded portions of the system at no additional charge. Now that it’s operating, it’s also very fascinating to watch the output on my computer.
The installation team was friendly, polite and professional.  Nice guys with friendly attitudes that didn’t mind me asking lots of questions.  Originally planned for two days, they finished in about a day and a half and totally cleaned up the site when they finished.
There are certainly many solar companies to choose from, but in my opinion, what sets these guys apart from others is their no pressure, extremely responsive, and flawless execution mentality.  There is nothing more I could have wanted from a Solar company, so to say I am very pleased and would highly recommend them is an understatement.< /text>

My company is PCH Services and one service that we provide is solar panel cleaning. Solar Watt Solution and my company have been working closely for about a year now. We both service but not limited to the Carlsbad and Encinitas areas. they have been referring me to their clients and vice versa. I have referred my clients to them for solar panel installation.
I cannot say enough about the professionalism and punctuality of this company. My clients have raved about the effortless process they have experienced with Solar Watt Solutions. I will gladly and eagerly recommend them to all of my family and client base. Thank you so much for such a wonderful business relationship! We look forward to a good, honest and hardworking 2020 season😁😎</Review>

No high-pressure sales gimmick and no BS either.  Solar Watt was very competitive and their execution was professional.  They are there for you post sale as well available for questions and help.  Solar is a no-brainer for us and we are enjoying not worrying about high electric bills and looking at a payback within 5 year years.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>We have installed solar panels into two of our houses and have used Solar Watt in both cases. We're very pleased with Dave, the owner, who takes his time explaining the available options, benefits and drawbacks, and has accommodated all our needs and requests. He offers the latest solar technology and does not charge a premium for that. His prices were quite competitive, especially with the big companies out there. We were quite happy with the work of his team, timing of installations and overall outcome. We have recommended him to our friends and neighbors.< /review>< rate>

<review>I did a lot of research before speaking with any solar suppliers, as the subject was new  to me. Then I contacted four suppliers, two large and two small, and requested a plan and bid to install solar in our 5,750 sq ft home in Rancho Santa Fe. Dave Watt, owner and operator of Solar Watt was included, as he had been recommended to me by my roofer who I have done business with for thirteen years. After speaking in detail with each of the four suppliers, Solar Watt was an easy choice.

Dave asked for the information from my electric bill which he needed to develop a plan and then came to the house and showed me four alternatives, clearly explaining each in a very accurate manner. (The two big suppliers told me things I knew to be incorrect and tried to sell me a larger system then I needed.They were also more expensive. The other small supplier offered a slightly lower cost but could not answer several of my questions about the system they were proposing).

The installation by Solar Watt was flawless with everyone and everything on schedule. The people working on the job were full time employees, not subcontractors, and were well trained and knew exactly what they were doing. Dave handled all of the paperwork including the permits and tie in to the electric company.

The final benefit is that Solar Watt guarantees in writing  that the system they design will produce 100% of the electricity promised each year, or they write you a check for the difference. Certainly one of the best suppliers I have ever worked with. Feel free to ask Dave to provide you with my name as a reference.< /review>< username>

<Text>My wife Barbara and I had Dave Watt from Solar Watt Solutions install our solar system several years ago and believe me it was one of the best financial decisions we have ever made. He was extremely knowledgeable regarding solar operations and did not try to over sell us on extra panels or extra equipment, he knew exactly what would work for our home. We have a custom built home with custom tiles and many varying roof angles and he had his crew installed them in the best areas for maximum efficiency. His crew did an excellent job and were very quick and efficient and not a single tile was broken or damaged. The entire job took only a few days. Dave and his onsite supervisor were there every step of the way and kept us informed of their progress. When the city inspector came to certify the completed job, he had nothing but praise about the entire job and stated we would get the all clear in a few days to turn the system on which we did. We purchased our system instead of renting or leasing which was best for us, we received just over $8,000.00 credit on our taxes for that year. Our solar system has been more effective than was projected. We run our A/C quite often during the warmer months plus she has an all electric car which cost us nothing to operate. I think we have had 2 or 3 electric bills of less than $20 each but did not have to pay because it rolled over into credits which balanced out with the next statement.

SolarWatt Solutions designed the right system for our house, gave us a reasonable price, did a high quality installation on time, and we have been getting the predicted energy savings ever since.  They answered all my questions in detail and did not try to pressure us during the sales process.   We are very pleased with the result.< /text>

<Review>Solar Watt Solutions did our solar installation in Nov 2017. We couldn’t be happier with the experience and the results. Everything from the initial consultation, the installation itself and the follow up was done with uttermost professionalism, quality and honesty. We highly recommend using them for your solar needs.

Dave and Andrew and their crew do a GREAT job!  The way these guys run their business they make you feel like you have a friend in the solar business.  They have a laid back, no pressure sales approach.  Very friendly, very knowledgeable, and they hit all the overall timeline goals.  Since I had some ideas on what I wanted to choose, and what I wanted to do, they worked through different panel options/availability with me, and we found the Enphase system that would work best for my installation.  Further, when comparing quotes for different options, they were cost competitive and the most flexible with working out my roofing (pre)work.  Great installation experience at every stage!!!< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Solar Watt was a pleasure to deal with from the first meeting all the way through the installation. I first met with Dave Watt (yes his name really is Watt). Dave gave me all the details and options and the difference between the different type systems that people install. There was never any pressure and you could tell that he truly meant that he would never install anything that he wouldn't put on his own house.

He set us up with Hero financing which was the easiest financing I have ever done, and the Hero folks were a pleasure to deal with. We put a high quality LG system on the house with no money out of pocket and no payments for a year. It is great watching the electric meter spin backwards. I can even monitor how much electricity I am making every hour online.

The installation team was also great. Everything was clean and professional and the system wiring looks like it is part of the house.

They say they will give you an honest evaluation whether you go with them or not and that is what I felt working with them. Of course I did end up using them, and happy I did.<//review>< Pictures>

We moved into a house that already had solar, but it was poorly supplied and the previous seller told us it covered his solar bill which was in fact a lie. When I reached out to the previous installation company, they were less than helpful. Many companies did not want to touch our house because of the existing solar, but Solar Watt worked with us thoroughly so that we could come up with a plan that would work with our current system. Ollie did a great job and had great patience when both my husband and myself wants to address many concerns and questions. The job was handled professionally and swiftly. We will be referring anyone who needs solar to Solar Watt. Thank you!< /Text>

The bytes that bring this post to you were powered in their origination by the sun, thanks to Solar Watt Solutions.  The fingers that mashed out the keystrokes (that formed said bytes) happily wrote a final check for a beautiful 8 kilowatt array, knowing that the check was an investment that will pay off three or four times before the warranty on the panels expires.  Our goal was to make an investment over our heads would reduce our overhead as we head toward retirement, easing our anxiety about our increasing electric bill.

What we didn't know was how free of anxiety the process would be with Solar Watt Solutions.  Morgan, our sales rep, patiently and professionally kept in touch with me after an initial proposal, while I was distracted with other household projects.  When the time came to go green, owner Dave Watt completed the project in under a month... and that includes the time it took for us to spruce up the section of roof that would hold the panels.

We could not be happier with the process and the results.  My wife commented a number of times on how professional and friendly the crew was.  Dave and Morgan responded to each of my queries very quickly, always by the close of the business day and often after hours if a question hit me late.   Their math was solid, the price was right, and the results are outstanding.

I would go on and on, but I'd rather get back to checking the app that is telling us how much electricity we are generating.<//Review>

<Review>We were referred to Solar Watt Solutions and met with the President Dave Watt. My wife and I were impressed with his sincerity and his presentation.
When they came to install the solar panels we found them to be efficient, reliable, on time and met all the commitments they made to us.
We also felt they went "over the top" to make sure everything was done correctly and to our satisfaction.
Based on our experience we would highly recommend this company for your solar panels.

In 2015 we interviewed four (4) solar companies to give us estimates on a ground mount system that would be designed to produce as much energy as we had historically used annually (on average for the previous 5 years).  David Watt of Solar Watt Solutions was the only company that answered every question we had on site and who could design a system for our specific needs / wants and flexibility to add to in the future.  Most companies send "sales staff" out to give quotes, but when they are asked technical questions related to the investment you are about to make they (strictly sales people) defer to having to ask someone else, which was highly undesirable and less than ideal for building confidence when wanting to achieve the shortest return on your investment (ROI).

We highly recommend Solar Watt for residential solar panel installation   We were on the brink of signing a lease agreement that would have foregone our tax credit and then I remembered Jim Mahoney and am so glad we reached out!  Solar Watt had our installation up & running in days and we now get CREDIT bills from SDG&E.  Our home value has increased and we are not on any payment plan.  Solar Watt was prompt, professional and attentive!<//text>

<UserId.>105179385757929344778<//UserId.><review>I've been looking at solar systems for the past couple years and was completely put off by the sales tactics used by other companies I met with. Then I heard about Solar Watt Solutions and decided to look into solar again. I'm so glad I made the call.

Their sales rep Jim was extremely knowledgeable and presented me with a very clear and honest assessment of my current power needs, the various panels available, and the return on investment of each option. There was no pressure and my extensive research prior to his visit confirmed that Solar Watt Solutions proposal was extremely competitive. I'm sure you could find cheaper panels somewhere, but I'm certain that you won't be gouged by this company.

Another pleasant surprise was how accurate they were on estimating when they could have the work started and finished. Their crew was very professional and had the system up and running even faster than promised.

If you want to support a local business and work with an ethical business owner (Dave Watt) who cares about both the quality of his work and his reputation in the community, look no further than Solar Watt Solutions. Our system is running flawlessly and it's so nice not having to shell out big checks to SDG&E anymore!</review>< user_name>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Honesty and service is what I got from Solar Watt Solutions. SWS was recommended by a friend who had done his own installation. Dave Watt came to my house and suggested what I needed.  I told him that I wanted to do my own installation. He agreed and did calculations with his gizmo to determine the best panel number/placement and gave me a price.  He handled the permitting process and sent me the materials.  They arrived on 3 pallets in about a week and a half if I remember correctly.  The hardest part was finding the location of my trusses beneath the concrete roof tiles.  I had questions about what the plans they gave me and was able to talk to a person who clarified what I was to do.  After about 3 years one of the reporting gizmos failed, they noticed this because they must periodically monitor systems.  Dave himself came to my house, found the failure and replaced the component all free of charge. Since installation I have never owed SDG&E in fact with my 25 panels i now have a $235 credit with SDG&E. I recommend them without reservation.</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I purchased my solar system from Solar Solutions  in 2013. My bill went from $600.00 per month (2.5 acres, pool, well) to $300.00 per Year.. I feel so strong about Dave Watt and his integrity that I have referred six friends who have also purchased from Solar Watt..</review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>We were having some issues with our Enphase Solar system connecting to our wi-fi network, and since the company who had done the install for the previous owner of our house was no longer providing service I went to the Enphase website to find another installer/service provider who might be able to help.  I found Solar Watt Solutions on the Enphase website and gave them a call.  The gentlemen with whom I spoke was very professional and courteous and let me know one of his technicians would give me a call within a couple of days.

Dave Watt gave me a call and spent almost an hour on the phone with me walking me through what needed to be done.  I finally got it connected and then later that night I saw that not all of the microinverters were sending data.  I called Enphase customer support and after some trouble-shooting the lady suggested I call my installer.  So I called Dave again and he walked me through a few steps until we got it figured out and fixed.  And all of this at no charge.

In my mind that is next-level customer service to provide that level of service to someone who isn't even your customer.  He very easily could have scheduled a service call and come out and charged me for what he did.  I would definitely recommend Solar Watt Solutions to anyone looking for a top notch solar company.<//Review>< pics>

<text>Deborah Romero was AWESOME. I'm totally uneducated on refinancing  mortgages and things like that. I mean its confusing. For that reason I'm always hesitant. I'm at someone else's mercy so to speak. I just would assume I'm probably going to be taken advantage of. So a part of me is always questioning. I'm asking friends about what's being told to me. I know, I'm just a mess! Deborah Romero was fantastic! I literally asked her 1000 questions. She explained, then re-explained the SAME stuff SEVERAL times.  She actually wouldn't ALLOW me to sign anything until I knew what it all meant. Emails probably 30 of them. All hours, it didn't matter. She even scheduled meetings after hours because of my husband's job. I would 100% recommend her for house buying, or refinancing. I walked away from this experience feeling great. I felt like I was even educated on the whole process. Refinancing and buying could be so scary. Thank you Deborah for actually caring, and being so patient.</text>< Response>

Deb was very skilled at navigating the hard parts of this refinance - and there were quite a few hard parts.  She is someone I highly recommend.  Almost anyone can get easy loans done.  But it takes a special someone to take a loan with difficulties, and get it done as if there were none.  She was able to do this for me, and ultimately provided a lower rate with less costs than we initially estimated.  I am very happy with her service.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Donna was a pleasure to work with. She is a true professional which made the whole experience easy and trouble free. She stays a head of the game so when it's time to close everything is in order and ready. I am a repeat customer of Donna and trust her with my financial needs when purchasing a house.</Text></record>

<Text>I have to say it was a most delightful experience working with Danielle and the Ability Mortgage Team. With Danielle as my primary contact throughout the refinance of my home during a pandemic was nothing short of amazing. Tough times on top of an already stressful situation refinancing she made it super easy and alot less stressful. She always answered my calls or messages to the many questions that I had very quik, polite, informative, professional, and just down right 5 star service quality!!! I'm happy to say that she got exactly what I needed done in the time that I needed it do be, and with the kind of attitude you would expect from a quality professional. I would absolutely
reccomend her! Thank you Danielle and the Ability Mortgage team. I look forward to working with you guys in the near future!< /Text><gmap_id>0x8090445077c07b3b:0xf0797a4a663ac429< /gmap_id>< resp>

The whole process was smooth and fast. When any issue came up you addressed and solved them. You made everything easy. And I would say your office seems about two weeks quicker than other banks I have used in the past.

This is one of the cleaner well-maintained Walmart stores and I’ve been in recent months. Perfect location for the foothills has about everything one would need. Fairly large and well stocked grocery section with the exception of the meat Dept.</Text>

Excellent check out lady!!  Always quick,helpful and service with a smile.  And yes she always was a mask but the smile comes out thru her personality.  She always checks me out and my daughter too. Both our transactions come with a great experience.  We look for her when we check out. I did tell her today that also.  She thanked us and said she appreciated us.  Petite older lady.  Feel bad I cant remember her name.  Thank you. Vera and Desiree<//Text>

< Review>
I'd give it no stars or -0 if u could.  I looked like Black Friday exploded all over the place. I picked clothing up off the floor as I realized running over. Moved on most of the isles were the same, merchandise all over the place, unfolded, dumped back onto the tables. Most isles blocked in places by merchandise and new stock boxes, pallets. The garden section was a disaster area, no flow to move, blocked, no organization. I put my items back, yes I am that person. I walked the merchandise back and left the store. I'll need something desperately to return. This is not the first time having this experience but this was the worst.<//Review>

<Text>This store is pretty clean and in better shape than you'd expect from an older store. Shelves can be pretty bare quite often, sometimes pallets block multiple aisles which bums me out when I'm trying to find something on a blocked aisle. Employees can seem a bit lazy, but I think that's pretty normal these days. They'll still happily help you if needed of course and they're very friendly. Always a great place to get necessities or blow a bunch of money you don't need to spend. 👍< /Text>< Pictures>

This review is specifically for their pharmacy department!

I meant to give a review on the link that was provided on the receipt they gave me but it was thrown away and I couldn’t find the link but this department deserves so much praise!
I usually don’t take the time to give reviews but the customer service that I experienced was one that stood out to me. Not only was I from out of town but I had the most difficult day going through body aches and pain.
When I arrived to the pharmacy I was greeted by a very nice gentlemen who promptly helped me out. Then the pharmacist explained the antibiotics to me and asked if I had my insurance card with me, which I didn’t.
They helped me get the best deal for my antibiotics, which they did not have to do but they went out of their way to help me out, which I was extremely grateful for. It has been hard during this pandemic, so the fact that these two individuals took the time to help me when I was in pain and financially helped me was so amazing! Kindness goes a long way and I appreciated it that day.

Thank you to the people working on 1/16/21 at 5:30pm!! Both were amazing!</review>

The milk has been sold already sour the last few times. I would not buy any refrigerator items at all, they don't seem to work well and keep food fresh. I work in food service and I'm quite aware of the temperature danger zone and food safety.

The rest is your typical Walmart. Every employee I've had help me has been extremely nice and given great service. I just wish they took the problems with the fridges seriously and sold us quality, fresh items.< /Text>

It's okay. I wouldn't use it for groceries though. The last time I went, they had 2 vegetables. It almost seems like an afterthought. The rest of the store seems okay. It's just small and you'd probably be better off ordering online.</text>

<Review>Good experience,  I used the self checkout and it went smoothly.  It should be noted however that there were several customers waiting in a line, and there should have been at least someone willing to open a second checkout stand, but they were unwilling. It would appear the customers time is not valuable. And for that reason I give them the 2.5 out of 5.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Ordered online pick up in store. Never received any notification the order was ready.  Received a call a week later saying they would cancel the order if it wasn't picked up. Have to walk to back of store for pickup.  No one was there to help. They require id to pick up. Just poor customer service & no follow through.  Canceled order...would rather just wait for home delivery.  This is a zero convenience system.<//review>

I rate them so low due to the scarry parking lot. Lots of homeless people living in cars and the creek. Even a murder in the parking lot 2 years ago. Lots of other crimes robberies and auto burglaries. Stay away at night.< /Text>

<text>Walmart was terrible! Not enough tellers opened, I'm talking about human manned tellers. Long lines , many selfs are empty, so I usually have to stop by another store to get what there out of stock on along the way home. I'm thinking it's easier to just shop elsewhere. It's not worth the aggregation of them always out of something's and the wait in the long lines is really pissing me off.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

It's a Walmart.... What can I say the men's department had clothing not folded couldn't find my size pants and the checkout lines were loaded with peeps. Self checkout wasn't bad so I went that route. Oh and my cart was probably sanitized... Had goop on it.... Smelled like alcohol though so washed my hands after either way.<//Review>

<text>It's a Walmart.... What can I say the men's department had clothing not folded couldn't find my size pants and the checkout lines were loaded with peeps. Self checkout wasn't bad so I went that route. Oh and my cart was probably sanitized... Had goop on it.... Smelled like alcohol though so washed my hands after either way.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Not a mega walmart ao they dont have everything but they have everything you need normally. Nice staff for the most part. Kinda sucks to be treated bad because other people steal. Mostly its the people at the exit that are unpleasant.</review>

Im a native to the county, born and raised. I was in high school when this place opened and it was epic. Its pretty much exactly like I remember it. As Walmarts go this location is great; the place is uber-clean and the shelves are stocked with just about everything a human being could want or need and at prices that make being a gluttonous consumer gorging on the sweet teet of our capitalistic society feel all but guilt free.
There is even an actual 'Greeter' that greets you as you enter the store! Its the stuff of department-store-cult-fanatacism! Sure I grew up in the county but in the big city life there is no such thing as Greeters so its always a breath of fresh, country, small town air when I visit the ole Walmart in Martel.
As I've stated, I am a county native so I say this with a warm heart, but any meme you've ever seen about the "people of Walmart" was created and designed with THIS Walmart in mind; THIS IS the archetypal Walmart.
Come for the great prices, vast selection of everything under the sun, or the friendly employees...but above all definitely make the trip as this Walmart offers more than just sustenance for our materialistic desires and compulsions - it offers a portal, a connection to the psyche, our immutable, collective unconsciouses. It presents us with a part of our selves that was long ago; a raw, home-grown slice of culture that is quickly being absorbed by mainstream society. We find humor in the "people of Walmart" because inside of each of us we conceal our own inner "Walmart persona."
This Walmart is truly a transcendent experience.< /Text>

I've never seen a crew work so slowly in the auto shop. It takes 3 employees over an hour to do 1 oil change. You are better off buying the tools and learning to do it yourself than wasting your time with these clowns<//text>

<Review>It's unfortunate that this Walmart is one of the very few retailers in amador county. Their selection is unbelievably slim and the staff was not very friendly. You will find some of the basics, but not all. I'm sure it has a lot to do with covid-19, but because of that shortage the employees should reflect that and be a little bit apologetic at least.<//Review><username>Emily Gardella< /username></record></dataset><record>

Managed to do a whole 200$ transaction without the cashier saying a word to me. She showed her loving personality when speaking to her work friends but hated me for being alive and in front of her. Managed to stuff a huge bag inside a bag and I can not for the life of me understand why. When I told her not to bag the milk she said rudly" I KNOW" But judging from the bag inside a bag, no... No she didn't know lol.</Review>

<Time>1607489499058</Time><rating>2<//rating><Review>It's always SO busy. Always. It's not big enough for the traffic they get. It's the only walmart in the area, no other option. The thin aisles are always full of people and pallets, makes it hard to even shop. Why can't the stock at night?
Certain items are locked up, so it's super annoying having to wait for someone to come unlock the case then stand there while you look at/for the item you want, THEN have to wait more for them to lock it in a box.
Seem to be out of alot of grocery items often.
Most of the time the staff doesn't seem like they want to talk to anyone or help anyone, busy stocking shelves or sweeping the floor.
It's unfortunate that this is the only walmart in almost 2 counties. It/they just can't handle the amount of people these days.<//Review>< Pics>

Typical Walmart. Order pickup can take over 10 minutes even without Covid going on. Ask every worker that meanders by and finally one will help or know who.</review>

As of the date of review, this location either is under-staffed or some of the staff is lazy. I waited as well as actively looked for a staff member to help me with getting an item from one of their many locked cabinets, as well as check to see if/when a certain item would be in stock, for over 30 minutes before finally giving up and shopping on Amazon.
The main thing that pushed me over the edge was when I saw 4 staff members (all looking under 25) just strolling past as the one older gentleman struggled with helping the many other customers who were waiting long before me. Every time I go to this location there's always something to make it a bad experience, thanks Amazon Prime, I'll be using you more often.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<text>Most of the staff are friendly and helpful but there are a few that seem bothered to be working. The store is really the only place in town other than grocery stores so it's understandable that it isn't easy to keep some items well stocked. I have been in there 4-5 times over the past 3 weeks and have never seen any cart sanitizer or much done as far as cleaning around the store. In such a small community there should be more done to help prevent the spread of Covid-19.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

The store was clean and seemed to be following  social distancing protocols. The staff was friendly and courteous. The shoe dept however was poorly  stocked and several shoe styles and sizes were out of stock.< /Text>

Face masks required to enter but you can take them off once inside. Many people do. No enforcement of code. Lackadaisical if you ask me.< /text>

Only on one occasion I have experienced helpful staff. So many items are locked away and staff hardly ever respond when the assistance needed button is pressed. I always have to go looking for a staff member to unlock a case for men's underwear or baby formula.
Otherwise covers items all Walmarts across the country carry. Its a small Walmart with a small freshfood section.< /text>

Greed has over come our country and is to blame for at least 55-60% of our countries malficients.< /Review>< Pics>

They are always out of stock, and shelves are lacking. This was going on even before Covid.</review>

So many empty shelves! The employees, with one exception, were not very helpful trying to find 3 similar products that the app said was in stock, but I was not able to find after almost an hour looking. There was one CSM who went out of her way to help me, but I sadly cannot remember her name.<//Review>

Bad experience I am a 70% deff vet that relies on lip reading mostly and the masks make it hard on top of not being able to hear through the plexiglass. The employees flat-out refuse to speak up or lean around a little bit to help the situation at all .</review>

You could depend on them to give you that helping hand if needed , while staying very professional . But the way theve got social distancing down , you would swear there was no pandemic at all . Employees , customers and deliverer's acted in unison and you just felt " AAAAaaahhhhhh " No STRESS... Love ya all , GOOD JOB.........But the reason for not so high of marks was cause of very low stock !

Overall a good older Walmart. The quality & variety of meat & produce is extremely bad!  Wish it was a newer 𝚂𝚞𝚙𝚎𝚛 Walmart. It seems the amount of business the store gets would justify a newer store!<//text>

<Text>There are some Walmarts I refuse too shop because they are filthy. This Walmart is very clean and tidy. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the store is smaller than others and I cannot always find what I need. But this store is always my FIRST stop in Jackson, Ca! 👍🏼<//Text><rate>4<//rate><user>107715373521688180507</user>< Date>

<text>You need something, Walmart, want to see some strange looking people, Walmart, you're bored just want something to do, Walmart, need a place to hang out, Walmart, you want McDonald's, Walmart, need money orders or to send money, Walmart, need to transfer your photos on your phone to,  regular pictures, Walmart, get pan handled by the homeless before you get to your car, Walmart, thought you could steal something from there then got busted and went to jail, Walmart! Want a job where you're overworked and underpaid, Walmart. So all-in-all, if you're a customer at Walmart it's great. Now if you work at Walmart, that's where you suck,! So go there just don't work there!< /text>< Pics>

I shop here often. It's not a mega Walmart, but it's huge inside. The isles are also wide enough for easy shopping. Staff are always willing to help and restock right away.< /Text>

< review>
It's really true,what people have repeated for a long time now: Once they run other stores out of business by under-cutting their pricesWal-Mart is no longer  inexpensive.Their produce section is really pricey.
Well,nothing lasts forever.Some company will come along and Wally World will go the way of Montgomery Wards,K-mart,Sears,J.C. Penney's,etc.</review>

<rating>3< /rating><response>None< /response><Review>It's ok. They just seem to be out of alotb of things alot of the time. They don't have much variety and they could be more helpful and understanding. They also lock stuff up but don't have anyone around to help you get bit out half the time and if you push the button you wait forever like 15-20 minutes of you actually wait. So maybe locking it upbwasnt such a good idea. Your losing alot of sales either way from being stolen or lack of help getting it out. Just sayin. :)</Review>< Gmap_id>

Customer service is a joke not just the department but the entire store,card readers barley work so be prepare to pay twice due to a card error and have customer service tell you it’s on your bank and not them and you’re unethical for wanting your money back(bank told me it was on Walmart’s end not theirs)..save yourself the headache and go to Lodi or target</review>

It's ok. They just seem to be out of alotb of things alot of the time. They don't have much variety and they could be more helpful and understanding. They also lock stuff up but don't have anyone around to help you get bit out half the time and if you push the button you wait forever like 15-20 minutes of you actually wait. So maybe locking it upbwasnt such a good idea. Your losing alot of sales either way from being stolen or lack of help getting it out. Just sayin. :)< /review>

<text>Customer service is a joke not just the department but the entire store,card readers barley work so be prepare to pay twice due to a card error and have customer service tell you it’s on your bank and not them and you’re unethical for wanting your money back(bank told me it was on Walmart’s end not theirs)..save yourself the headache and go to Lodi or target</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Oil changes take f.o.r.e.v.e.r!!! Only one car in front of me and it took over 2 hours and 20 minutes. NOTHING NEW for Jackson AND Lodi so this was the last time I bother with Walmart's service center. I tried getting tires before too. Another joke.</Review>

<Text>Call our Walmart Amador Macy's. Only department store really in Amador County. Good prices clean store usually have everything you need. Would love a super Walmart or like inside you can make the old Kmart a Walmart grocery store. I know we don't need another grocery store in the county but Walmart grocery stores are fabulous I would still shop for things at Safeway because they have the best produce and Deli in the county in my opinion<//Text><rate>5</rate>< resp>

Shelves were pretty bare.  Very limited selection of merchandise. Overall I would give this store a negative star. The only reason for the 2 stars is the employees. Otherwise pass on by.
Need a target here badly instead!!</Review>

Nothing is EVER stocked. If you ask for help 99% of the time the employees look at you like your asking them to do something in unbelievably impossible and handle it with the littlest amount of care possible with the maximum amount of attitude. I hate going here but living in a small town leaves you no choice sometimes.<//review>

<Text>For a weekday afternoon a lot of spots on the shelves were bare. I could understand if it was a weekend, evening. The thermostat could use some adjusting, it was stuffy in there. The bathrooms were accommodating; changing station for babies, lowered sink for handicapped and small children. The only one vending machine (of 3) that carries Water is inoperable. It's a shame this store isn't better, as there isnt another one in this area for miles and miles....</Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Name>

<Review>I have been a customer for years at this store with no issues, have always enjoyed it.  This Christmas I purchased a gift card only to find out that someone had stolen the money off of it. I disputed the purchases, and the management and accounting staff were on top of it. I was fully reimbursed,  and they have the surveillance of the thief.  I really appreciate all that was done to help me. Therefore my rating went from 4 to 5 stars. Great job folks!< /Review>< Pics>

Went to get an oil change on my car and found out they changed the policy for oil changes .You use to buy the oil and filter for  your  car that you wanted and Walmart would only charge you around 9 dollars and change for the oil change .As long as you bought the oil and filter from the store. You know what gets me is Walmart makes money on the oil change also the purchase for the oil and  filter and  they get the used oil that they receive from there customers. As far as I'm concern they got the last of my business</Text>

No pleasure shopping at Walmart. They treat everyone like a thief.  If you buy shoes, the cashier opens the box and looks inside the shoes and shakes the shoes.  When you leave they examine your receipt and rescan your basket.  Humiliating.  We dontvshop here anymore.<//Text>

Some items are locked up to prevent theft..then, you cant get help from.someone with a key..and they take your item to the register.  This is what happens when theft becomes an issue
Look at the walmarts in the valley. Modesto, ceres, turlock all of them have items locked in glass cases or in plastic lock boxes because some people steal.<//Text>

<Name>Heather Hammergren< /Name><text>This WalMart really needs to become a Super Walmart. It is to small, it smells, and the employees are some of rudest people in the county.
The isles are narrow, and they are horribly labeled. It takes forever to find anything, and most of the time they are out of it anyway.
Also for being one of the only places to shop for clothing in town, the selection is horrible.< /text>< user_id>

< review>
This WalMart really needs to become a Super Walmart. It is to small, it smells, and the employees are some of rudest people in the county.
The isles are narrow, and they are horribly labeled. It takes forever to find anything, and most of the time they are out of it anyway.
Also for being one of the only places to shop for clothing in town, the selection is horrible.< /review>

It was a mixed bag @ this Walmart. I had several VERY HELPFUL, SUPPORTIVE EMPLOYEES working outside in the parking lot(my van wouldn't start, I was parked 1st. Parking space,1st. Row, Right in front of the doors into Walmart!)who spent time trying to help me locate a Towing Service as well as an Auto Repair Garage (I was visiting front Santa Cruz & unfamiliar w/Martell~Jackson area.)letting me use their cell phone since mine wasn't working. Inside the store, there were employees who said Hi, asked me if they could help me & were cheerful, wishing me a wonderful rest of my stay there. Then there were the
Staff who didn't want to extend themselves an inch helping, were curt talking to me & dismissive. Overall, there were twice as many helpful, concerned, working @ helping me find resources as well as empathetic to my being stranded & took it upon themselves to speak to their managers on my behalf about my situation;
verifying my van wouldn't be towed away & easing my stress level immensely. Their genuine concern & efforts were a great comfort to me in my awkward position w/my van stuck for several days (It happened on Saturday & my van was finally towed on Tuesday afternoon!) Front Row isle @ Walmart on a busy weekend.</review>

I think our cashier's name was Eric, he was a late 20's to early 40's guy with a mustache- so nice, very polite. It was great experience for me, my daughter, & my fella. I know it was the end of the day but you rocked.Thank you Eric.</Review>

Your typical Wal-Mart. But being in a small town it's smaller then others. Selection of clothes and sizes is very limited. No lingerie at all except Valentine's day. Then nothing in plus sizes. And only 5 or 6 styles. Auto service only does oil change.</text>

ALWAYS a long wait. Now they have mostly self check out lines. I'm older. When I do major shopping, I need a bagger. No thank you. I have walked out of this store twice leaving over $100 of groceries both times.<//Text>

Walmart is a family money saver on most items. It is probably one of the few stores that Amazon won't put out of business, I don't blame Amazon they are doing what consumer 's want, shopping centers to dry up and shut down!</Review>

<Review>This store seems to ALWAYS be out of stock. It's sooo frustrating to go there and often find either bare shelves or only one or two items of what you need. Walmart really needs to get it together with this store! I came to this site looking for their actual delivery days so I can find out which day of the week I should do my shopping on since I often feel like I'm completely wasting my time going there! There is absolutely no reason to let your stock get that low. ESPECIALLY when other than K-mart, you're the only store in town! I live in a rural area, and there aren't a whole lot of choices to shop for home goods. Perhaps that is why Walmart just doesn't care about keeping their stock up? Because they know they can get away with it. But they're also losing a ton of money when people can't buy what they need!! My husband even wrote Walmart corporate a letter complaining about our stores low stock but never even received a response. How rude! And very bad business! If there were some place else I could go without driving an hour to get there, I would. But unfortunately that's not the case where I live. Get it together Walmart or let the little guys come back in and show you how it's done!!< /Review><GmapID>0x809a7c7796576359:0xa04e96cbabe3001a<//GmapID>< username>

<Text>Why have a paint area if no one will help you. I wanted three cans mixed. I waited 27 minutes. I asked five people for help. I heard the loud speakers mention the paint station twice. I walked out with no paint. It took 5 minutes at lowes. And by the way this has happened two other times in the last year.< /Text>< pictures>

Had a little trouble with sending some money it seems the other party had trouble getting the money until they download the app which they shouldnt have to do. Depending on which walmart you deal with someone needs to train there employees about what is the right way. One does seem which is right even after i explained what happen she tried telling me that didnt happen so you deside< /review>

Why have a paint area if no one will help you. I wanted three cans mixed. I waited 27 minutes. I asked five people for help. I heard the loud speakers mention the paint station twice. I walked out with no paint. It took 5 minutes at lowes. And by the way this has happened two other times in the last year.</Review>

Never enough checkers. They want you to go through the self check and still pay the same price while you do the work.

Plus I don't pay membership, not showing my receipt.</review>

Well... Its a small-town Wal-Mart. Clothing mostly caters to very large individuals, but the prices, selections & staff can't be beat! I would very much appreciate if they "step up their game" & carry more high quality items like Wal-Mart's in larger cities - but it may not be profitable for the store given its location. All in all worth shopping here.</text>

<Text>I've spent. Total of 20 minutes, just hearing the phone ring to speak to an associate, or electronics, just to avoid an unnecessary trip.

They got what you need, but they pretty much killed Kmart, which had been here much longer.<//review>

I was the ONLY ONE at the counter!! The pictures are very poor quality as well !!! I have been going to Walgreens to get my pictures developed for the last three years and a friend said I should go to Walmart that They are cheeper and now we know why! I will never go back there to get my pictures developed! Walgreens has better employee service and way better picture quality service as well. On the receipt the name of the person who  helped me was Bobby Maupin. I don't think it was him unless the lady is name Bobby. Bobby is the manager as it says on the receipt if you would
lead by example and be at your area!<//text>< Response>

Mike in the Pharmacy put me on hold twice for a total of about 15 minutes before I gave up. Then I requested to speak with the store manager, and whomever that was did not bother to answer the page twice. After about 20 min. I got the answer to a very simple question, if a product was in stock......unbelievable that any corporation would allow this type of disrespectful customer service. I am thinking about complaining to the corporate office, but it probably wouldn't make much difference.<//Review>

We all know what Walmart is: Low prices and low standards for their clientele's dress code.  They have what most Walmarts should have.  Nothing particularly unique here.< /text>

But no, it's against the store policy.

<text>not a lot of help.  Wal-Mart is the new Kmart. Ads I'm paper did not represent what was actually on sale in the store. Very disappointing consider a drove over an hour out of my way to get there.<//text>< Name>

<text>The store seems dirty, and lots of empty spaces on the shelves, and for a WalMart, their selection is very lacking.

3 stars just because it is better than going to Lodi or Sacramento for shopping.<//text>< gmapID>

Went in with a list of about 10 things that I have always purchase at another Walmart frequently in the past and they only had 2 of the items. Save your time and drive into Placerville.< /review>< pictures>

We go here often and this store has just about anything you could need. except they don't have any French bread.Lots of ice cream choices and so much more. Try it out but stay clear on Sundays after church because it can get really busy and lines crowd. However you can go to self checkout and save time as long as you have 20 items or less and no alcohol can go through the self checkout.< /Text>

Apart from it being a Wal-Mart.  The global leader in child labor and horrendous sweatshops. The store is completely outdated. The registers are not able to scan gift cards or coupons on a mobil device and the chip readers never work.  Most of the staff are incompetent and unhelpful.<//Text>

My grandparents and I went into Walmart tonight and out of every cash register there were only 2 open and tons of people waiting in line. My grandparents and I got in line and we had to switch over to another register because management had let the poor woman at the register run out of cash so she had to switch over to a new one. I don't know what management was doing but having 2 registers open when you have a line of people is rediclious management themselfs should have jumped on registers to help with customers service. Walmart needs to rethink their prioritys< /Text>
