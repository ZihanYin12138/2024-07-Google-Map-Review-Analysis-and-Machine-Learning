<text>You’ve done well today. I was through the outside pharmacy line in 15 minutes with two cars ahead of me! Keep up the good work and you may change your reputation!!!! Just a tip: eye contact is nice when you talk to people...at times I heard you talking but had no clue you were talking to me because you weren’t looking at me.<//text>< Pictures>

No one should have to call every day for 6 days to get a legitimate, regular scrip refilled. Set up appointment for flu shot, waited 30 minutes. Set up appointment for shingles shot, waited 40 minutes only to be told they couldn’t get the computer to work. Said they would get back to me to reschedule. That was three months ago.

Totally filthy. Dirty toilet paper scattered around the entrance of the store and absolute disregard to health and safety in the store. Flies all over the place too and a nauseating stink throughout the store. Disgusting. Additionally very slow service.<//text>

Also, you may be risking your life just going to this place the parking lot is always of crack heads and homeless people. I have seen drug deals go down in front of the front door while waiting for somebody inside. Walgreens needs to close this place down just to save their own image.</Review>< Pictures>

Walgreens lost a long time customer. Stopped by on Sunday to pickup prescription, was told to come back and it would be ready. I come back only to find out they "don't have the medicine and I should call other Walgreens locations to see if they have it." At this point, why trust Walgreens word they have it somewhere else? I can show up there also only to be blown off. I'll never go back.<//Text>

Worse service ever in the pharmacy, I've been waiting one hour and twenty two minutes just to pick up an eye drops, despite that they told it was just to take 15 min. I WILL NEVER NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE, don't come here don't waste ur time! Choose any other place!<//text>

<Review>Awful customer service withthe pharmacy. They will say they are transferring you to speak with some and after waiting you will hear the line be picked up and then immediately put back on hold numerous times until they inevitably end the call. When you call back they are rude and unhelpful. It's been 4hours since my prescription was called in and they still haven't completeled it. Trash.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I completely understand that there are sick patients who need services more urgently than I, but there has not been a single time I have waited less than 35 minutes to just pick up a prescription.
And the drive-thru line is just insane. I waited almost an hour and one of the pharmacists just kept coming to say “one more minute.”
Not sure why exactly this store isn’t able to get it together like most other Walgreens stores, but it should definitely be evaluated.
I’ve never seen more angry customers.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>The employees over here are rude, lazy and disrespectful. Im not saying all of them are, but the majority for the most part. I went in on 2 seperate occassions to print some pictures, and no one even acknowledged me yet alone, tried to help me.  Even after i asked. I understand the practice of social distancing, but by the way some of these employee treat customers, the employees should really just stay at home. ill never go here again.</review>< GmapID>

Worst pharmacy ever!!!! My doctor sent the script for 3 medications 2 times because they said they didnt get it! Then my doctor just called them on the phone and when I called Walgreens back they said they got the prescription and that all 3 would be ready by 12:30pm. My husband took his lunch so he could go get the prescriptions and they said we dont have one of those prescriptions here at all (NEVER MENTIONED ON THE PHONE). Then, even after checking my pharmacy providers through my insurance which confirmed they do take my insurance, the pharmacist said no actually we dont take your insurance and tried to tell my husband that a prescription of ibuprofen would come to $60. DO NOT GO HERE. WORST PHARMACY I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH.<//Text>

<Text>If less of a wait time, which is so horrible it is unacceptable, I'd give them 5 stars, because their staff us usually quite pleasant.  They do confuse details about insurance and we have overpaid, but they finally figured it out.  Oh well, dollars lost.<//Text>< pics>

Very bad experience with this pharmacy I get description from the emergency for my son and he was with me in a very bad condition in some way I lost his insurance card so  I asked Rocio to contact the insurance company. She asked me his SSN I give it to here. she said  wait for couple minutes.  But she left the pharmacy for 20 minutes when she back she said your son insurance is pending. But it was active at that time!. She lied to me! I went to the county they give me a ttemprory cart so when i show it to here she lied again and said it just reactivated I told her my son insurance been reactivated two months ago. after that another person checked it and give me the description. I wait over 13 hours to get my son emergency  description!!! Just because they "too  Lazy" to contact the insurance company. I can't believe that's happened here in U.S!!!</text>

<Review>Charles at the Pharmacy was flat out rude. He made fun of my name the first time I decided to get my medication from Walgreens. The next time I go, he gives me a hard time for using the drive up window. To think I even gave them a second shot was just not right. I sent my persecription to CVS down the street and don’t plan on ever going here again. Don’t waste your time going to this Walgreens, it will just make you feel worse than you did before.</Review>< Date>

Something needs to be done about the pharmacy drive-thru. To let a car sit at the window for 20 minutes or more backs up their line and makes customers wait for a very long time to get to the front. I waited in line for 45 minutes earlier today and didn't make it to third up before my children lost it and I had to leave. My husband is currently in line and has been for an hour. He's two behind the window. Some changes need to be made to make the line more efficient. I'm sure this is something they hear quite often. It's the only Walgreens in town and I will be changing pharmacies after this evening.<//Review>

terrible pharmacy. they will not fill your prescription and make up lies about insurance issues which do no exist. I have been there 5 time and still no pills. save yourself the frustration and go somewhere else(they dont want to spend the money to buy your pills). If you try to call you will get hung up on multiple times< /review>

Nothing against the workers, they have always been great (so I'll give 2 stars instead of 1), but I've never been able to get a prescription filled in a timely manner. I think they must be understaffed.

Just tonight it took almost 3 hours to get a basic prescription for Amoxicillin filled for my daughter with an ear infection.  It was the final straw (of several experiences) that caused me to write this review.

I hope you are able to get more staff in hand soon.< /review>

< Review>
I would give this pharmacy zero stars if possible! DO NOT USE THIS PHARMACY unless you want to sit in line for over 1hr waiting on a prescription that is already ready. Yes Im the 3rd car in line right now and have been here over an hour the line has not moved once. This is a sad excuse for a pharmacy! I even had my husband go inside and there are 9 people in line. 5 people behind the counter and only 2 are helping customers. Nobody has even acknowledged the window. I am going to find the number to corporate and report this location. And this happens EVERY time you come to this location! Just dont go there unless you want to be mad by the time you get service.</Review>

<Review>Agree with all the other posters that the line is insane at pretty much all times and they are so slow to move through customers. I am pregnant and have been taking an antidepressant for probably 6 months now and every single time I go to pick up my refill (which they have to call and confirm with my OBGYN), I am made to feel like a drug addict. They ask me every time if I am pregnant and then I have to wait extra time for the pharmacist to come and talk to me. They act like they are giving me opioids during pregnancy which what I’m taking is actually the safest antidepressant during pregnancy. I get this refill every few weeks and it’s always the same song and dance. Yesterday my prescription was filled, they had already contacted the doctor, and the pharmacist still refused to give me my medication until they spoke with my doctor on the phone to “make sure everything was ok”. I am now in the process of having my doctor just send a new prescription to a new pharmacy because I’m tired of being harassed every time I try to pick up medication. Ridiculous.

Cashier Usha and Manager Joe should be FIRED immediately - can you believe this - they won't let customers use the restroom after 9pm despite being open 24 hours. Here in this tourist central location?? Wow... Anyway there's a Safeway right across the street - go there instead! Absolutely criminal treatment of customers.</Review>< pics>

<review>Called in my prescription refill. Was not notified until I tried to pick it up that I can't get it refilled. Now I'm out if meds. Terrible service.  Waited over 20 minutes in line.

To be fair, everyone was courteous, when I was able to speak with actual people. When I have shopped here, I haven't had any complaints. But I can't use the pharmacy if no one will help me. Goodbye, Walgreens.< /text><Time>1373334272974</Time>< user_id>

< Review>
Getting a hold of anyone in the Pharmacy via phone is difficult. I've called three time son one day to speak to a Pharmacist and instead was placed on hold by automated service for 40-60 minutes each time before hanging up because no one picked up my call. I then called again first thing in the morning to see if maybe it was the time of day that I was calling and still no one ever picked up the phone... held on the line for 45 minutes before hanging up. What happened to Customer Service? Why do you not answer your calls? Very bad customer service...< /Review>

I use the pharmacy exclusively and every time I go I wonder why I am still using this place. The wait is always terrible. They usually have only one employee helping the people in the store and at the pharmacy window. So frustrating!<//text>

The worst pharmacy in town. The wait is 45 minutes on average or longer. The treatment of customers is non professional. If your prescription is not ready, be prepared to hear cooked up explanations about your coverage or insurance by the pharmacy manager.

Just take your business somewhere else.<//Review>

i work at a doctor's office and calling in prescriptions are a hassle. i wait on hold for 45-60 minutes sometimes more at a time. get an answer after 45 minutes then get put on hold AGAIN for another 10 minutes. customer service is ridiculous. if i could give this pharmacy no stars i would.<//Review>

Open 24 hours. Night staff is friendly, even with desperate people on the wee hours of the morning. At times this store is way under staffed, but the staff that are there have tried to make up for it.<//Review>

Went there based on the reviews. I am satisfied with the helpful, friendly service. I spent a little (a lot) extra money for American made products but they also offer cheaper Chinese alternatives.< /text>

Moose and Bruce.....

These guys are genuine down to earth people. So helpful and informative.
Kind and chill.

If your looking for something particular, come here, ask about it, if they don't have it on the spot they will special order for you!
Or if you're just wanting to check out the shop and look around, you wont be disappointed.

From top glass like diamond, Grav Labs, Mav, and my personal favorite, DOPE glass with their sugar perc. THE FUTURE! ha

Check it out, you will be impressed.< /Review>

I’ve had the Turkey avocado sandwich and just tried the chicken and bacon chipotle sandwich, both were very tasty, especially the chipotle sauce.< /Review>

Breakfast like Mom would make it; absolutely delicious. Food is fresh, made to order, and very very tasty. They also serve a fantastic lunch. Service is quick and precise and staff are awesome!! I eat here almost everyday & as long as they're around I will continue to do so. Love this place!</Text>

< Review>
After 40 years of dental terror every time I sat in the chair, I finally found a place that made my  fears ease and gave me a smile that I am proud.  For the first time in my life.

I have recommended Dr. McKay to 3 people who have all shared the same positive experience that I did.  Dr. McKay and his team are amazing!<//Review>

<review>Everyone is very  friendly, helpful, and efficient, from the front desk to the hygienist ( Gita is gentle but thorough and does a great job).  All the techs and assistants make your visit comfortable and a good experience.  Dr McKay is a wonderful dentist, he does beautiful work, I’ve had a filling, crown work, and dental implant work, and highly recommend him and this office for any and all dental procedures you might need.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

My previous wonderful experience with the now retired Dr Albus was way back in 1977. I have now returned (2021) for what I genuinely look forward to with Dr. Mackay! Roxana has been a delight !
Lovely practice.☺️<//text>

After 22 years of dental service disappointments in about 10 different dental offices, I finally found the best dental office. I love the experienced, honest, friendly, and most professional doctors, assistants, and personal.
May GOD always bless this dental office!

Sincerely,

<Review>I've been going there on-and-off since 2008 / 2009. I primarily go to see Gita who is one of their best hygienists. My insurance is covered under another dentist, but if I need an extra cleaning, I see her. The only feedback I have is the communication from the front desk. I've left voicemails in the past and weeks have gone by, or sometimes there's been no answer. Overall, they're pretty solid. Just let Gita know exactly what you want / looking for so there are no extra charges. She's pretty transparent with every procedure she does.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< rate>

<Text>I usually don’t leave reviews for much of what I do but this place demands it.

I came here primarily for a cosmetic consultation. After visiting multiple dentists, I decided to move forward with Toluca Lake Dentistry, and It was the best decision I’ve made. Right off the bat, they lay out all your options and discuss pricing; at the other offices I went to, they all told me that pricing was “variable”and cannot be estimated, which sounds like a scam. More importantly, the quality of work and care here is exceptional. Dr. McKay truly listened to what my goals were concerning my smile, and provided the exact treatment I expected, if not better! Every person that works here is so nice and they seem like they really like their jobs. This place is my new dental hub not only for aesthetics, but even for routine cleaning. Highly recommend!</Text></record>

<text>I have been taken care of by Dr McKay and the Toluca Lake Dentist team for 10 years now. Never had to wait more that 5 minutes at the lobby (no overbooking!), the friendly staff always makes sure you are taken care of, Dr McKay’s work is top notch, and in case of dental emergencies, I have always been promptly accommodated.  Shout out to Gita, my dental hygienist, I have never looked forward to a tooth cleaning until I met her.< /text>< pics>

I’ve been seeing Dr. McKay for years. He does excellent work. Gita is an exceptional hygienist. The entire staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. Their team makes me look forward to trips to the dentist. I would highly recommend you see them for your dental care needs.</Text>

< review>
I can't possibly say enough good things to describe the team at Toluca Lake Dentistry. After years of easy visits, I got clobbered during the COVID-19 pandemic with excruciating pain under a 3-tooth bridge. Facing the prospect of a long wait, I texted Roxanna in desperation at 1 a.m. on a Sunday night and she called back at 6 a.m. to get me in to see the doctor first thing. Roxanna has been managing the practice for as long as I can remember--at least 37 years. She knows absolutely everything, from dentistry to billing, and she's got a great sense of humor too, which makes her the perfect liaison between patients and the doctor. Dr. McKay combines the perfect balance of precision, efficiency, and knowledge to handle even the most complicated situations. He also takes the time answer any questions and to explain what he is doing and why, which I find very helpful. He initially attempted a root canal by drilling through the bridge, the most conservative remedy, but found it was impossible because the acidic nature of the root infection neutralized the numbing agent (alkaline). A further complication was that the second root had calcified over, making it impossible to view in an x-ray or safely drill without risking disaster. So Dr. McKay shifted to plan-B, which was to remove the existing bridge and a neighboring crown, extract the tooth, disinfect the area, and create a 4-tooth bridge. This completely solved the problem and left me with a quick, painless recovery. The entire staff at Toluca Lake Dentistry is friendly and proficient in best methods in this state-of-the-art facility. Each person is a master in their area of specialization and they work together as a well-coordinated team to solve any dental issue. Dentistry is expensive, so it pays to go to a team that gets it right the first time. I'd give them 10 stars if I could!<//review>

<text>Coming from the best Dentist in NYC, I was a little nervous on my expectations...Dr. Ronald McKay and Gita came through with a very comfortable, clean, organized and thorough experience. I would highly recommend them to anyone and everyone! ... And finally, after all these years I look forward to my next 6 month cleaning (did I just say that?)!<//text>< pics>

Hate to do this. Never leave bad reviews, but they left me no choice; so I rather make sure future patrons have the transparency I wasn't afforded. Upon booking an appointment online; I was contacted to make sure that my Insurance carrier was accepted (I get it, then need to make sure they're covered before wasting they're time) I submitted my info, green pass go. what they failed to tell me was that while its accepted , its out side of my network, so I would have out of pocket costs. Through out the visit I was asked multiple times 'how did you hear about us' etc. to which I responded every time that it was just convenience as I live down the street. There were multiple times times where they could have been transparent with me about my insurance. True, in the end I could have known better so its my fault, but it speaks volumes to how they do business: *before you enter lets make sure your insurance clears......if it does'nt pay in full; doesnt matter, they got theirs you'll figure out the rest* reeks of desperation and nickel and diming. There charges didn't reflect what my insurances did, to which I called and found out they made a mistake. on top of which they added a PPE fee after the fact. Im all for protection during these stressful times, and the people working there should be treated with protection and safety....but after how they handled everything, it was too much to now after the fact slap a fee on. Didnt help that when I said it should be removed because I was never notified, the woman tried to guilt trip me saying I don't want them to be protected. Tell you what, next time....first be upfront with your customer and not so concerned with only lining your own pocket before you ask your customer to be concerned for you. The penny pinching and thin veiled guilt shaming wasnt a great look for this office.<//Text>

I walked in as an emergency extraction new patient and walked out a happy, happy person! The care, empathy, and professionalism of everyone from the front desk to the dental assistant, to Dr. McKay the dentist himself revised my thoughts on dentistry! I seriously didn’t realize the tooth had even been taken out  when the doctor said “all done”! Never have I ever experienced pain free dentistry on that level.  I’m a dentist coward but I definitely will be happy to continue going here for my dental needs.  Thank you everyone who helped me!< /text>

I have been going to TLD for 25 years, but had not been in the past few years due to moving out of the city. Dr. MaKay and staff has done an excellent job in continuing Dr. Albus' legacy!! I needed an emergency root canal and Roxana booked me within 2 days and called in antibiotics the same day I called!! At the appointment, Dr. McKay gently explained everything he was doing and Jocelyn was extremely thorough in ensuring that there was no cement under my temp crown to prevent inflammation and pain. My tooth was pretty bad, the procedure took longer and no one complained.  Roxana called me the next day to see how I was doing. As I had not been there in a few years, it felt like going home, seeing everyone again. Every staff member you pass in the hallway had a huge smile. Cynthia cleaned my teeth (thank you to whoever cancelled) and did an amazing and thorough job as always. You cannot go wrong with TLD. They are a family, like family, the only dentist I trust and are worth driving every mile, even 3 hours each way!!<//review>

Dr. McKay is the best dentist I've ever been to, and I've tried a lot of dentists and have had a lot of dental work. It's hard to find a good dentist in Southern California! Dr. McKay is kind, gentle, understanding, caring, and very knowledgeable. I had been going to him for a while, and when I went to a different dentist in my insurance group, I got an implant done. After 4 crowns I was not happy with, I had to go back to Dr. McKay to get the proper abutment and crown! He knew immediately what needed to be done! He is extremely knowledgeable and uses advanced techniques, and cares SO MUCH about his patients. I am very very happy with him and recommend him to everyone!</Text>

My experience with Dr. McKay and his staff could not have been better!

With school out, I had my son with me for the day. We were greeted by a friendly and professional staff. My hygienist, Ghita. was an expert at her work, and she put on the Disney Channel for my son keeping him happy and occupied during the cleaning.

Dr. McKay could not have been warmer or more welcoming. I felt like my teeth were in expert hands. I’m so glad I went to Toluca Lake Dentists for my dental care.

I’ll be making appointments for my two sons too. I highly recommend Dr. McKay.</Text>

I was looking for a new dentist closer to home that matched the quality of the work I had received with my family dentist growing up.

My expectations were EXCEEDED. (which is not normally a thing for me as I have high expectations...haha.. and this is actually the first time I have stopped to write a review - they were that good!)

The staff was kind, attentive and personable. Dr. McKay was thorough, attentive and knowledgeable. He took the time to pay acute attention to the health of each tooth and then took the time to explain to me what was the situation with my teeth AND answer any questions that came up!

I would highly recommend Dr. McKay and Staff!!< /text>< pics>

I LOVE Toluca Lake Dentistry. I have been going to their doctors for over 10 years, and each and everyone of them have a calm demeanor, excellent technical skills and a very gentle touch. I always feel safe and well taken care with them. AND their office staff is incredible...led by the office manager Roxanne who is a dream. I cannot recommend them highly enough.</review>

I have never enjoyed going to the dentist, but Dr. McKay and his staff make it so easy to love. I went off of google reviews myself, and I’m so happy I followed them. They’re caring, understanding, and take the time to explain everything. If you’re new to the area, or just wanting to switch doctors - I couldn’t recommend them enough.</Review>

<review>When I first started going to Dr. McKay my office was only a few minutes away and it was convenient.  However, my office has now moved to Hollywood and I live over 20 miles away, but I refuse to find another dentist because Dr. McKay is amazing.  In addition, his entire team is top- notch.  They are not only extremely friendly and accommodating, but they are all great at what they do.  I don't mind the drive because I know they will take very good care of me.</review><username>Joy Ann Daffern</username><Rating>5</Rating>< Date>

I finally found a dentist Dr. McKay who I feel have the expertise, experience and knowledge that makes a great dentist. He takes time to explain the course of treatment needed and has a good  patient rapport. Thank you Dr McKay.
I love Christina the hygienist. She definitely did an excellent job cleaning my teeth. She is the best! I did not get the name of the lady ( sorry I hope  you know who you are ) that goes around and greet patients. Not sure what her title is but she is awesome. She makes you feel comfortable and welcomed  each and every visit you make. I also want to acknowledge  the assistant of Dr. McKay  who worked on my temporary crown for an excellent job.
This office is beautiful and clean. Great location. And if you are lucky you can even get a room with a view while your teeth is being worked on.
BTW, they are open on weekends. I love this place. Great staff.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2be32e718c6cf:0x3c97fd7e20fbc437</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<name>Don Fair</name><Review>Another year - and more important dental procedures have been scheduled during my visit yesterday with Dr. McKay and his staff.   The result of last year's work -- four visits over two months - were A-plus and I would anticipate the same for this year.   Our entire family happily uses Toluca Lake Dentists' Dr. McKay.       Nothing has changed since last year's review -- which is below:

Having moved to Studio City, I needed a new dentist that had two primary talents:  1)  sensitivity to my fears  2) an expert in some detailed dental surgery and follow-up.    From the first call to up an appointment to meet with Dr. McKay -- to my last cleaning, the front office staff has been attentive.   The support staff who do the dental work very responsive to my fears and dealt with them in a supportive way.   And, Dr. McKay is terrific.   So far two members of my family and several friends are moving to the Toluca Lake Dental practice and I expect many more to follow.<//Review>< Response>

I called to explain I have a wisdom tooth finally coming through my gum well into adulthood, which probably needs to be removed, and they said I needed to do a consult before referring me to their affiliated oral surgeon. I went to this consult and got a full set of x-rays which were nearly $200. Then Dr. McKay looked at the x-rays and looked at the tooth and said, "Yup, that should come out. Go to the front desk for your referral." That was the entire visit. I called the oral surgeon's office to whom I was being referred and was told the x-rays that Dr. McKay's office took were not done well (never mind they were very painful to take, in the first place) and would need to be redone. I asked their receptionist if I even needed to see Dr. McKay to get the referral and she told me, "No, you could have just called us. We do everything you need." So now I get to pay for x-rays twice while having wasted my time on the first office visit. This was all about increasing their billing and not about taking care of the patient.< /Review><user_name>Matthew Merkovich</user_name>< rating>

Everyone in this office is really lovely. Receptionists, hygienists and dentists are all super friendly, attentive and kind. During cleanings, the hygienists check in frequently to make sure you are comfortable. They ask plenty of questions and take time to explain anything you ask of them.<//review>

I can't say anything negative about Toluca Lake Dentists!  All the hygienists are kind, gentle and thorough . . . and Dr McKay who is a 'painless' dentist.  The front desk staff does an amazing job juggling openings and being as accommodating as possible.</Text>

<Review>Dr McKay did my entire upper teeth, I wasn't happy with my smile after finishing Invisalign.
He took the time to give me a detailed explanation of how my teeth would look like with porcelain crowns.
He even had his lab guy there to pick the shade for me. I have never been happier with my natural looking smile, thanks Dr McKay and team!<//Review></record>

Gita is one of the best for dental care. She is warm, keeps a smiling face and a pleasure to have work on my teeth - especially since seeing the dentist is such a challenge for me. Gita is very relaxing and knows her stuff. I would highly recommend the staff at Toluca Lake Dentists. They are highly professional and have a beautiful, serene environment for their patients!< /review>

1. When you call NO ONE knows what the other is doing...they transfer you around as if they could care less. Was transferred from one to another receptionist because the fist assumed i had no  doctor in mind..
when 2nd receptionist took all my info and discovered i'd like another doctor she said "OH" and transferred me to the first who began to weave a description of how they have two separate doctors office in the same
office...OY VEY!! Just wanted my teeth cleaned not a dissertation on who is who and what protocol  is in their office.</Text>

Kind crowded but family environment
Great DJ Music to be dancing all night
Gorgeous Paisanas shaking su Cha Cha Cha lol wit punta rebanes
VIP only 125 including the bottle x those who like to lubricate their throat

<text>It's a fun upbeat Hispanic atmosphere with plentiful to choose from their menu and alcohol to make your night . I enjoyed it such a wonderful night out including the dance floor it was just too.much fun.  I didnt give it 5 star because the womans bathroom was too over crowded with no toiletries you had to get hand drying paper towels if you wanted to use the womans restroom and that's really inconvenient<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

There was a short thin piece of hair in the curtido too.  Unacceptable and dangerous.  I would not trust how they handle food here!!! It is obvious they have no concern for safety and food health.

<Review>Im a neighbor i was so excited to have them here same  block , there not only a restaurant there also a club . I understand people.like to drink.party even on thursdays nights til 2am and even monday night til.1 . But please have some consideration get some  noise sound protectors , and respect your neighbors there customers park in street parking and leave there trash behing empty bottles eighter beer or alcohol  there customer park in our driveways which I had told the security more than once , when club is over from thurs-sunday 2am . Theres people fighting throwing bottles on the parking waking up the neighborhood . Have some respect get in my shoes , and its rare when theres 2 securities.<//Review>< rating>

(Translated by Google) 1000% recommended a safe place, guarded parking, the best atmosphere, first-class customer service, excellent food and very cheerful music. I recommend them here to celebrate my birthday to my girlfriend and give the option to fix the tables as one wishes.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very unpleasant because they respect neither the table nor the people, and if that were not enough, the people are very aggressive about the manager who attacked me and the bad music.

(Translated by Google) I am somewhat worried ... I want to visit the place but with these opinions I am not so sure anymore ... The most important thing is the TABLES SERVICE .. And if they are RUDE AND NOT FRIENDLY it is already DISAPPOINTING because the most important thing is THAT YOU TAKE CARE How they would like to be SERVED ... KINDLY AND with A SMILE,. And if they take a long time with the Orders, then too ... !!!

(Original)
Estoy algo preocupada... Quiero visitar el lugar pero con estas opiniones ya no estoy tan segura... Lo más importante es el SERVICIO DE MESERAS .. Y si son GROSERAS Y NO AMABLES  ya es DECEPCIONANTE porque lo más importante es QUE TE ATIENDAN Como les gustaría ser ATENDIDAS... AMABLEMENTE Y  con UNA SONRISA ,. Y si tardan mucho con las Órdenes pues también...!!!<//review>

(Translated by Google) Everything is super good ... just one detail does not suit me just what the people who arrived on weekends early and consumed more than $ 150 and when they pass 10 p.m. tea want to charge cover .... and at the end of tea they want to get out of shape after consuming ... they should take it into account ... Everything else ... very good

(Original)
Todo está súper bien... sólo un detalle no se me ase justo qué las personas que llegamos en fin de semana desde temprano y consumimos más de $150 y cuando pasan de las 10 p.m. té quieran cobrar cover....y de remate té quieran sacar de mal manera después de consumir..... deberían tomarlo en cuenta... Lo demás..muy bien</Text>

(Translated by Google) The atmosphere is good but .. the waitresses are not all but very rude it seems that one gets to ask for gifts, the food takes a long time .. my husband and I ordered a shell cocktail. If it is possible to call anything of presentation .. apart salty ..

(Original)
El ambiente esta bueno pero .. las meseras no todas pero  bien groseras parece que uno llega a pedir regalado  , la comida tarda mucho .. mi esposo y yo pedimos un coctel de conchas.  Si es que se puede llamar haci nada de presentación .. aparte salado..</Text>

I absolutely loved this shop! I work in a metaphysical/crystal shop in Maryland and this place really felt like home! Great friendly people working there, good energy. I loved their selection! So many stones including a few I had been seeking for quite a while (Okenite!) and at good prices.  They also stock a reasonable selection of decks and other supplies too. I will definitely make my way back again next trip out west!< /review>

Wonderful, magical store filled with everything one can want and need. The staff are super helpful and friendly. Everything is reasonably priced and I found statues here that I hadn't been able to find elsewhere. Thanks for such a smooth shopping experience.</Text>

Super friendly staff. Great protocol for COVID. Perfect place for your magical wares or unique gifts. Excellent selection of Tarot cards and crystals. They also sell bulk herbs which have always been great quality and good prices. Highly recommend this local gem!<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>The Sacred Well has the most consistently lovely display of gemstones and jewelry I've seen in the bay so far. Usually if I can't find something, or am on a more rare search, they have what I'm looking for.
The jewelry, though, is my favorite.
Simple, powerful, clean.
The energy of any gem store can get overwhelming fast, but this place keeps calling me back.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>I have been coming to this store for nearly 7 years. There is an amazing staff, all of whom are very knowledgeable. There is always an excellent selection of crystals, all of which are hand selected at places like the Tuscon Gem Show. They feature art by local artists, have a great candle, herb, book, and oil selections. There's even a community altar, and regular temple services to Aphrodite, and Hekate - and one for Dionysus that is starting up. Magic happens every day.

This place has been a sanctuary for me from the first, and they are a safe space for all who need it.< /Text><user>114848753677026227577</user>< resp>

In one of the cases lay a rose quartz pendulum attached to a bronze hand and I felt a strong connect to him. I intended to purchase the pendulum becuase when I held it, it felt right and the energy was intense with a lovely glow. I handed it off to the lady at the shop because she offered to bring it to the front, she dropped it on the way there. It wasn’t until my friend and I were finishing our purchase that they realized it was broken. And without the pendulum our bill would have come to $32. However because they believed that we had broken it, I was charged and the bill was $57. The lady who dropped it, upon my frown, smirked. And a man offered the creator’s contact information, but he didn’t understand the situation properly and rudely ripped away the post it that held the woman’s information and sped off into the back. I am sorely disappointed and left the once light shop feeling slimely and as though I had been played.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Great place for all of your mineral related needs. Fantastic variety of Rare and common stones, rough, polished, carved, and otherwise. Definitely NOT a hub of witchcraft and the black arts. 😉</Review></record>

They have a great selection of polished and tumbled gemstones and a moderate selection of other metaphysical supplies such as candles, incense, oils and books. It's a fun place to stop on a visit to Lake Merritt.

They get 4 stars because unfortunately it is not a comfortable shopping experience. They eagle eye every customer as if everyone were suspect as a thief. They made my boyfriend and I, who would never steal, feel very uncomfortable. Make sure to clean your crystals to get the negative energy out before use....</text>

Sacred well is a gem in Oakland. Located by the Lake Merritt makes the shop easy to access and has all that you will need for spells, reading, or anything this to do with New Age culture.

They are reasonable priced and the staff are awesome and helpful.<//text>

This store is great! It recently changed its name to The Raven's Wing Magical Co., and the site that now calls itself The Sacred Well is not affiliated with the brick and mortar store in Oakland.< /Review>

<Text>I do really like the sop in itself and have met some interesting people of all kinds here, but I did have a negative experience where I was sitting and browsing through a book in their shop for awhile, and sitting there must have irritated one of the workers (whose name I didn't catch... it was a plus-sized woman with glasses and short dyed hair working there is all I remember,) who to my face said that it was alright and to take my time, but then promptly went into the back room and was loudly telling another worker there that I seemed "pretentious", despite quietly sitting there and trying not to do any harm. When I left their restroom I asked the co-worker she had if I was troubling them by reading at the table, they brushed it off and said absolutely not... but that was a very uncomfortable experience overall. I ended up buying the book and leaving, and have returned once a blue moon but rarely ever do because of how uncomfortable her staring made me feel. It's a shame since other than that one negative experience, it's a lovely place for artists or spiritualists nonetheless! I don't know much about it but would have liked to have felt more comfortable going back. Kinda sad.</Text>< UserId.>

Excellent shop for all Magickal needs. There's a wide selection of crystals, incense and jewelry. The book selection is a bit on the light side, but they feature local authors prominently, which is very nice.

The readers there are intuitive, emphatic and, well... Psychic! They offer good practical advice with a touch of genuine Magick!</Review>

Sugar cane drink is good, but the drink is filled with ice more than the sugar cane.  Tastes good,  fresh.</review>

<review>HORRIBLE SERVICE!! I called and ordered 3 nuoc mia with LESS ICE, i came over and they gave us three cups that was full of ice! i would rate them a zero star if i could. we called them again and told them about it. the guy said that we didn’t pick it up yet. we then told him that we already did and why he gave us so much ice. he told us why didn’t you tell us? we did! he said he was standing at the cashier but there was a woman instead. $15 wasn’t that much but we were mad that they argued back since we were the customers honestly do not recommend going there unless you want to be treated with horrible service!!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< rating>

Everyone here said sugarcane here is tasty.  And i have no disagreement.  However, the drink tasted too sweet to the point i think aspartame is added.  Try this, taste the sugarcane drink and wait several minutes you will still taste the sugary in your mouth.< /Text>

Nuoc Mia Vien Tay is located in Little Saigon, Orange County, CA.  It was one of the first Viet businesses that sale sugar cane juice (nuoc mia) year round back in the early years of 1990s and it was one the best places for authentic Viet foods.</Text>

<text>Yes, the nuoc Mia (sugar cane) drink here is bomb.  And the cups are enormous... Great deal for fresh nuoc mia ($5.50).  I love that I can taste the kumquat in there... Gives it some fragrance and acidity to balance the sweetness.  I like to let me ice melt so that it's not so sweet.  If you want fresh authentic nuoc mia... This is where u go... I tried a bakery and Lee's and they don't come close to this one.</text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Sugarcane juice is delicious but a bit too much ice. In the glass about 2/3 is ice. If you like a lot of ice instead of a lot of sugarcane juice, you will enjoy it.

(Translated by Google) I have to say, everytime I came here the sugar cane juice was delicious, always sweet, never sour tasting, consistency wins the game, highly recommended.

The water here is hot all the time, never got sick, because it's according to me, I don't know how people are doing, it's delicious.

I have been a regular customer for years.. some experiences at various shops have been better than others..
For a franchise-type business, I think consistency would be a priority.. but it's not the case.. some give MUCH BETTER customer service that others.. and I try to share that with their corporate office..</Text>

< review>
Made small talk to one of the girls there about seeing her drunk at the bar having a good time, I wasn't flirting and I wasn't being negative, but i guess she took it wrong. Next thing I know the manager is telling me that multiple girls there are accusing me of saying inappropriate things and in order to get coffee there I have to be escorted by  a Safeway employee. That lasted for almost a year.  That ended 6 months ago. Most of the original girls don't work there anymore. I see the troublemaker there from time to time, but its Abby who has been rude to me ever since and I've never been anything but nice to her!<//review>

Coffee is the same as any other Starbucks.  The drive through line is always crazy long. Will take you 20+ min to get coffee during busy times (which is most of the day sadly)</review>

Get a Venti coffee and get out quick. 20 oz of caffeinated goodness. Other customers and baristas can be annoying though.< /Review>

Parking here is horrible, the drive through is horrible. And the parking lot is small. This is the busiest Starbucks in the region and the only one in grass valley.<//Text>

<review>False advertising the website says closes at 9 yet they close at 6:30....very upset!  So please don't go after 6:30 terrible customer service from starbuck employees. Attitude beyond belief. Still probably never go to this location again. Sadly</review>< pictures>

Let me start off by saying that Facey Medical Group is a fantastic Clinic. They do Urgent Care. But you can also schedule with your physician or your doctor here. This fantastic Clinic is located in Mission Hills California. In the San Fernando Valley. On Sepulveda Boulevard between Rinaldi in San Fernando Mission Boulevard. The staff is always helpful. A my doctor particularly is awesome very attentive to my needs. Thank you so much for being part of my family</Review>

I have received excellent care from Facey Medical. I have Multiple Sclerosis and both my previous Neurologist Dr. Lekkala (before her move), and my current Neurologist Dr. Doris Cardenas, along with Dr. Vernon Lackman, MD Internal Medicine are extremely knowledgeable, compassionate, innovative and attentive in caring for my physical needs as they arise. I’m very grateful for my team of Facey Doctors! God Bless each of them. Stay Safe & Healthy!</text>

She said “I don’t think that you need an EKG, but do whatever you  want.” She did it, but  very unprofessional. So I went to make a complain and I changed my primary doctor.<//Review>< pictures>

Do NOT go here for covid testing.  They had us sitting INSIDE  a room with a bunch of cubicles where the man next to us had tested positive.  We were sitting in there for 30 MINUTES.  We were probably MORE exposed at their testing site than we have EVER been.  And then, the physician tried to talk us out of getting a test. I DON'T GET IT!

Opt to go to a testing site where you do not have to get out of your car.  This was the WORST experience!

IF I DIDN'T HAVE COVID WHEN I WALKED IN, I PROBABLY DO NOW!</review>

Just had cataract surgery on Monday at the Holy Cross Eye Center. I was very pleased with the service and the staff was efficient and caring. If anyone is looking for the best Eye Doctor I would highly reccomend  Dr. K. Shah. My surgery was absolutely painless and when they took off my eye patch today my eye sight was crystal clear! I cant wait to go back to do my other eye! Thank you Dr. Shah!! See you soon!<//text>

On Wednesday July 15, 2020 I made an appointment to be seen in the ER at Facey Mission Hills. My scheduled appointment time was 10:08 AM.
The new procedure is very efficient, minimizing wasted time.
I went to the ER for injuries to my back that I had sustained in a fall, on Tuesday the 14th,
I was very fortunate in that I was seen by Doctor Ana S. Lopes. I found her to be very thorough, knowledgeable and caring.
She requested x-rays, that proved to be inconclusive, so she then requested an MRI.
The MRI was completed at Holy Cross in Mission Hills at 6:30 PM on Thursday July e16th.
At 8:45 PM tonight Thursday July 16, Doctor Lopes contacted me at home to convey the prognosis, no fracture to the ribs or spine.
I would consider Doctor Ana S. Lopes a very valuable asset to Facey Medical Group.< /Text>

This was my first visit at the medical group, since my doctor had switch groups. Even though I told them I would be paying cash for the visit when I scheduled my appointment, once I arrived they told me I couldn’t since I was under a medical group which was not in there plan. Who turns down a cash visit to see a doctor. They couldn’t even give me a clear explanation. I wasn’t allowed to see my doctor. Facet medical group is the WORST!!!!!!< /review>

Facey is going downhill fast and not what it was a few years ago.   You can't even see your primary physician unless you're willing to wait for several months.  And if you need to see a specialist it's even worse.  The attitude of the nurses is going downhill as well because they are probably overworked and understaffed. Weird Customer Service no body in information desk This is really becoming an issue.   I've been with Facey for 20 years.  It wasn't great about 5 years ago....  then greatly Improved and provided quality and prompt care..... and is sadly now going downhill again at an alarming rate.   Time for me to look elsewhere for quality care. Getting medical record its not easy they are using third party and to get it you need to call be ready awaiting time on the phone 2 hours  plus a fee....very disappointed!!!

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>Dr. Wilson is the worst excuse for a doctor. Her and her staff are horrible, even before the virus thing began. From what my mom tells me, the wait time is over an hour and they make it seem like the patient is late but the doctor will see them anyway. What doctor doesn't take vitals if nothing else? (mind you, for an elderly person especially). Whether it's a follow up or not, it's usually protocol. Anything can develop within just a couple of months, more so when there has been high stress due to family deaths and such. . I've got to convince my mom to change to an actual doctor, not someone who arrives super late and does absolutely nothing but charge a huge bill.< /text>< gmap_id>

<review>I went into their urgent care with lower right abdominal pain. Can we say appendicitis? They told me it was just an ovary on my cyst and nothing to worry about. I tried to convince them and they just wrote me off and made me leave. I drove myself to the next closest ER (whom I didn’t have insurance through) and told them I was in severe pain and sure enough they did a scan and I had appendicitis. I had to have my appendix removed and by this time it had already exploded. Thanks Facey you literally almost killed me! Facey seems to hire doctors that barely passed in their schooling. You can’t trust any diagnosis they make.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

This was my first time here as I just moved here. I went in to get a check up on a test that had come back irregular, and everyone was so nice! Up until the nurse practitioner that was doing my test made me feel like an idiot for wanting to get this test now rather than wait till the end of the year. She practically laughed in my face and told me that all of my family history had nothing to do with this test. You would think doctors would want the full history especially when treating a new patient. The whole point is to calm your patients and treat them when they’re nervous about previous test results. I would come back but I would not see that doctor again. Completely unprofessional of her. She should take notes from her colleagues on patient care.</Review>

First time at this facility for a follow up at the doctors advice from an urgent care for a virus he wanted me to have a test done to see if I had asthma, they asked a bunch of question about what he other doctor did and gave me I mentioned my Oxygen was low when I saw him it was at 92% so he put me on a nebulizer and I felt better!
so also they also put me on a nebulizer of albuterol and Ipratropium I had not eaten and I had a very bad reaction of shakiness and very light head! I have had inhalers with Albuterol prior.
I felt I did not need to have a nebulizer I felt fine! So while on it my blood pressure went up to 171/104 hence they gave me prescription for  BP pills and an inhaler that would have cost me $200 which I could not pay for! It’s a shame you wait so long for an in and out visit that takes 2.5 hours and a massive bill most people cannot pay! Disappointing results< /Text>

<Review>The absolute worst doctors on this planet. My mother was diagnosed with lung cancer Only after I rush her to emergency at holy cross . For over a year she complained to her personal physician of chest pains. Unfortunately her doctor was absolutely the bottom of the barrel . Played it off as a cold . Heard similar nightmare frustrating stories from other patients that were in the fate of Facey doctors . My mother passed away soon after . but perhaps if she was diagnosed sooner , I do believe she would be alive now. Stay away from these 3rd rate doctors.</Review>< username>

<Text>I have been with Facey for nearly thirty years. I am, and remain, very impressed with their comprehensive and efficient service. The Doctors are always polite, friendly and very thorough. The Facilities, and I use several different ones, are always clean, modern and impressive. Cannot recommend them enough. I complained for years about the phone delays, but they seem to have control of even that now. Good job Facey, Keep it up!.</Text><gmapID>0x80c2906b93c7e289:0xc46d8a0a536a5417</gmapID><pics>None</pics><UserId.>100360743966464589010</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

There were paper signs all over the Facey lot but NO signs saying that non-customers couldn't park there.  As we were walking to the sidewalk I noticed a man dressed vaguely as a guard skulking toward that.  He didn't try to get our attention or the other peoples'; he just walked to our cars and started taking pictures of our license plates.  He was NOT leaving any notes on the cars.  I walked back and asked what he was doing.  He said he was taking pictures because we weren't supposed to be there.  We told him there was no sign saying so, and he said "I am the sign."  This is the first "sign" that I've seen that skulks around taking pictures and doesn't give actual information to you.  I did think it's a kind of sign.  Whoever bought the premises chose this man and gave him that mission because this is how they see PEOPLE--as problems.  It's a very BAD sign in my opinion.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I have never had a bad experience with Facey. I have been going here for over 8 years. My doctor Daniel Lewis is caring, kind and always has a smile on his face. The nurses are helpful each time I come. I had a big issue with my insurance and they still saw me and treated me the same. I would never want to go to another provider.</Text>

Why is it that no offices seem to answer their phones?  I did not "experience a brief delay" as last week I was put on hold for 45 minutes,  45 minutes and 30 minutes at the Northridge Office and still never spoke to someone.  I had to drive to the office to get my appointment.  I can assure you that none of the receptionists were on the phone.  They explained it was because of the new computer system.  Unacceptable!  Today I was placed on hold for close to 20 minutes waiting to make an appointment with a Porter Ranch doctor to whom I was referred.  However, the referral hasn't yet been processed so now I am on hold hell with utilization review.  I am seriously considering getting a new doctor when it's time to re-enroll in October.<//text>

I read quite a few negative reviews, however, I have NEVER had a bad or negative experience at Facey. Dr Svetlana Fischer is kind and compassionate and listens to what I have to say. I've been to the Urgent Care several times and always received top notch treatment. The Lab Dept personnel have always been kind, courteous and efficient at their job.  My experiences with the Behavioral Health Unit and the Vision Dept were very much the same.<//Text>

< Review>
This place is a joke, my daughter was just taken there this morning, by her aunt. She is running a high fever, and nauseated, and what my sister was told was to take her to the ED dept. as they stated her insurance was HMO,. I think the receptionist there need to be better educated. As my daughters insurance is not HMO and they refused to see her because of that. They did not offer to pay out of pocket for services.  How can you turn away patients just because you are ignorant in your field.  I'm very frustrated with this type of services.  I do not recommend this place to anyone. BAD SERVICE/CUSTOMER SERVICE< /Review>

I have really liked my doctors here but the whole building seems poorly managed. I’ve been here more than 5 times now and I ALWAYS wait more than an hour after my appointment time to see my doctors.

Edit: review downgraded from 2 to 1. I had a sample taken and after 2 weeks of no results, I called my doctor’s office to follow up. It took 4 calls over 2 weeks to get a callback. I got my bill before I even got my results! We might call this another administrative issue but when I finally got a call back, it was obvious that my doctor 1) didn’t remember my case 2) didn’t take note about what I said during the last visit.<//Text>

Worst medical office I have ever been. The Northridge office moved to new location almost 10 month ago, they lost all the patient's contacts, I had Dr. visit for extensive blood exam & that was in Nov. 2017, till this day I haven't heard from them in regards to the results, neither received a letter explaining what I need … I called the Dr office, the nurse promised to send the result but they failed, I called after 2 months again & they promised to send again, but they never did. If it was possible to not give any star I would do. without shame they said that they lost their patients contact due to their mistake, I asked them to contact the bus. office to obtain mine, they said they can't locate, because the info was lost in the server. What a reliable medical office... I will not return to Facey med. office again & do not recommend to any one.<//review>

Horrible wait time. Management sucks. I brought my infant son in because he had a small cough and I had to wait over an hour with all the other urgent care patients that were coughing up a storm. He might end up getting more sick. Im taking my insurance elsewhere.</text>

No a very happy camper,  I make an appointment at 10:40am, I show up at 10:35am and they tell me they won't be able to see me until almost 11:40am!!!!! How upsetting!!!!! I'm loosening money here people!!!!!!! No a way to do things! If an appointment is made, the time should be respected.

I might just changed to a different Dr.!!!

The service sucks!!!!!!!!<//Text>

I am not impressed by the nurses and staff.  They seem to have no concern when something needs to get done. It's their job to make sure they stay on top of their Dr, and they don't. I don't know if they are lazy or just don't care. But they need to fire and rehire all new staff.</text>

By far Face has to be one of the worst Medical Groups out there.  My review is overall on Facey and not the actual dr that I saw.

On 11/27 I had an appointment with Dr. Singh, she referred me downstairs to get lab work and for 24 hour Urine analysis.  The lab downstairs is Quest, upon the phlebotomist drawing my blood I asked if I could drop off the urine at a Quest near my home (I live on the West Side of the valley), he advised me that I can drop it off at any Quest.

I attempted to drop off the urine at a Quest in Northridge.  Unfortunately they would not take it, they advised me that no lab orders were in place.

I called the dr's office, was advised that I can drop off at Facey in Northridge, proceeded to drive to Facey in Northridge only to arrive to an empty building, it appears that Facey in Northridge had moved and yet their employee had no knowledge of this.

Long story short no amount of apologies from Facey can get me to ever go back to Facey!  Years ago they messed up with my son and here I am giving them a 2nd chance and the minute I do, they are already screwing up!  Shame on you Facey for not educating your employees properly! A 24 hour Urine collection is not simple when you work 8 plus hours in an office.  I had to strategically plan getting that collection out to you guys, and then it all went to waste because the limited window that I had to drop off the specimen was missed on account of your lack of training employees.<//Text>

Horrible experience with colonoscopy. Moderation sedation was not sufficient to put me under to not feel the scope going through my insides; never was expressed that I would not be "out" for the procedure. I have been put out for oral surgery numerous times so that I know was not an issue.Asked to have procedure stopped because of the pain and Dr. Beshay refused. No sympathy, no sorry it hurt. I will NEVER do this again.Previous experiences with this facility have been great.< /text>

<rating>1</rating><Review>I am new to Facey. I was transitioning from one medical office to Facey. I have severe back and hip pain and am on meds as a result. From the moment I walked in, I was treated like some kind of drug addict bc of the meds I needed. Both doctors that I saw rushed through the appointment with me and never truly listened to anything that I said and just referred me to pain management before even listening to my issue. Of course, even once I was approved for PM it was going to take me a month to get an appointment. I tried to talk to my doctor at Facey to see if I could get meds to hold me over until my appointment and was told flat out NO. Instead the doctor suggested that I try detox as if my injuries that required medication were made up. I've been going through hell for years trying to get my back, feet and hips fixed and I thought Facey would be the ones to help me finally. Instead, they made me feel like some kind of criminal that was lying about my injuries... Even though she had a MRI in front of her showing damage. So even tho I pay for good insurance now, I'm not only NOT getting the help I need... But I was made to feel as if I had done something wrong by asking for medication that I NEED and have been on for YEARS. And both female doctors that I saw, just rushed through the appointment not even listening to me or caring. I left the building in tears today.  They doctor didn't even go through my new patient chart to address the concerns that I had. They didn't request the referrals that I needed or give me birth control that I asked for. It was like as soon as they saw I needed pain meds, I was just some druggie that they wanted out of the office. Thanks a lot docs, I thought you would be my saving grace but instead you just made my pain and depression worse. So I still have no answers as to why I'm in so much pain and no pain medication to help me in the meantime. I could have kept getting this kind of treatment with Medi-Cal...< /Review>< pics>

<Review>My wife and I have been patients with Facey Medical Group 20 years. However , the management and staff have lost their ability to be companionate , it's all about Money.
When our doctor decided to retire , he asked my wife to come in so they could say goodbye. He recommended a doctor to takeover his patients. Then that doctor called my wife in for a meet and greet. FACEY charged my wife who is permanently disabled , $100 for each visit. These were more social than medical meetings. Within weeks , FACEY ejected and HealthCare Partners took over.
Shortly after that , the new doctor was discharged , resulting in average care at best.
But FACEY has threatened us with collection ,  even after several attempts asking for these charges to be dropped. We all have suffered thru financial difficulties after the collapse in 2009. For those of us trying to recover on just one income , recovery has been slow and hard. It doesn't help when a greedy medical group like FACEY behaves with such malice. It's been a over a year ago and they can't listen to reason and let it go.
Be careful when dealing with FACEY. Their interests are not about the patient , only your money.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I waited a long time in the little room the put you in. They told me it would be a few minutes I was in there for about 45 minutes before I walked out. This is unacceptable. The owner should stop apologizing and do something.</text>

Employees were great, very helpful. First time at this location so I wasn't familiar with the layout and had to go to help desk to locate what I was looking for. Took only a moment and they sent me in the right direction and had someone meet me there, they were very quick to respond and met me halfway. Led me to exactly what I needed. Quick and easy. Very happy with the service, extra appreciated since I happened to be in a rush tonight and I was in and out like it was nothing. Thanks!< /Text>

The workers were so smart. They have lots and lots of intelligence. They told me to wear a mask in the car. I told them to get a better job and work somewhere that gives them better pay. They really need to get a new job because they ain’t getting hired anywhere. Those people are living off the government’s money not their own. They probably couldn’t count money if they had to. Never returning to Iraq again.

<Review>I would like to commend the Associate that helped me earlier. I forgot to get his name but the transaction was a curbside pick up between 4:06pm to 4:30pm. It was very busy with long waiting time but he was still very friendly, respectful and accomodating. Happy Holidays to you and hoping for a wonderful and successful path towards you 🍻</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I hadn't been here in over 2 years but since Fry's recently closed I thought I'd check it out and I was actually surprised at the variety of brands and price levels. I do miss all the inexpensive things you could fill a shopping cart with while spending hours cruising the aisles at Fry's...< /Text>

<review>Went to the Geek Squad to retrieve data off an old dead computer. Called to make an appointment and it was punctual. Everyone was masked and socially distanced.  The young man Josh, who set up my ticket was very knowledgeable, polite and responsive .
So far so good.  I'll update when they return my computer and data.</review>< Pictures>

<Rate>3< /Rate><text>Well, the store is clean and fairly well stocked. Its a large building with many sections. However, I needed help finding a product. There were a lot of customers that day. The clerks who weren't occupied with customers were grouped by three or four, chatting with each other. I walked up to them and was ignored. Even when I said, "Excuse me," and waved my hand, they acted like I wasn't there and just kept talking. I left without making a purchase and won't be back.< /text>< Pictures>

I can’t believe it such a good A+ customer service Provided Store supervisor African-American male 57 tall bald hair.He’ll be a good example for anyone working there to grow the company future.I have a problem with my son NBA 2k21 They can find it after I order online at the store.I requested store supervisor he show up and provide excellent customer service and he told we can’t find the CD and he offer me two replacement the upgraded version After I take you home my son Xbox is older and the CD is not working.The next day I go to the store open the box which is not a company policy replace or return he offer me the exact version I need and he approve request to replace for me which is excellent I just want to say thank helpful respectful Store supervisor.</Text>

<Review>We went early upon opening hour, no crowd and we got what we hoped for, and better.
We even called in advance for particular item and when we arrived details weren't given over phone. It turned out better to actually see the items we considered purchasing.</Review>< pics>

Staff was upbeat and pleasantly in control of the lines of anxious customers during a pandemic.  Inside the store the rep was knowledgeable about the product, answered questions politely, and listened to our needs before recommending a brand of computer camera.< /review>

This Best Buy location is convenient to where I am at...staff is hit or miss, selection is moderate. I was able to order a replacement S-pen for my phone, pay in advance, and have it shipped to me.  It arrived late...supposed to be to me by Friday; came 9:30pm Saturday. No big deal...just so thrilled to have a stylus again!< /Review>

One simple item that I ordered for curbside pickup and what do I get 3 hours later? "We're unable to find it" one of the good reasons why I prefer to order from competitors as they get the job done right.< /Review>

Worst Best Buy in San Jose, staff couldn't handle getting 1 item from an online order that was placed 2 hours ahead of time. Then told me I have to wait for someone else to get the item and bring it to online order pick up. Won't be coming or spending money here anytime soon<//review>

We bought a dishwasher at Best Buy in February, but had several issues. When the installer came, he said the copper plumbing is incompatible and the dishwasher doesn't fit (which I do blame myself for not measuring accurately). Coming back to Best Buy, we ordered the correct ADA compliant dishwasher and ready to install in July. The old copper plumbing was replaced and preparation for the dishwasher. When the same installer called me, he saw that the incorrect dishwasher was ordered and we had to wait until August to receive the dishwasher.<//text>

Amazing store. I ordered something online and it did not take me more than 3 minutes to get it and out. Fast and good service. The street entrance gets really busy at some times but the parking it's pretty big. It's easy to find a parking spot available. Amazing customer service, specially really fast if you are in a hurry.</review>

Store was air conditioned, so that's a plus. Best buy has all the technology you could possibly need. This store is very large and has a geek squad on the left side. I liked the service and look of it, but disliked how overpriced things were. You can easily get things for cheaper at Staples or Amazon. Other than the pricing, a very nice facility.< /text>

Why would website say available for same day pick up if item isn't available?
Here i am right before they close the store because i never got the email that item was ready to be picked up. THE LAME EXCUSE I GOT WAS SORRY WE HAVE 5000 ORDERS PENDING...LIKE REALLY? Then that means something is wrong with your service and product availability. They canbtake your miney quickly but can't give you your product same day like advertised. SOME TRAINING NEEDS TO BE DONE or something. Waste of time...not only that I called also and left me on hold for over 30 minutes and they just hung up...what great service....< /Text>

Purchased a Dyson Cyclone V10 animal pro on November 25th 2020 @ $499.00, the price dropped a hundred dollars on November 26th, 2020 and other retailers also had it for $399. So I went to the store on Curtner Ave, San Jose (where I initially made the purchase) and asked for a credit or a price match (was showing $399 on Best buy website). They said they can't do it. The only alternative was to purchase another one (which is now out of stock) and return the original one.< /review>< Pics>

Went in for geek squad and got my headset razor replaced but even better since the replacement wasn't in stock they helped me by upgrading me to the top of the line razor headset. Had to get the warranty again just because it was a different model but great for working with me to get my product right there and then. No wait time but I did go right when they opened. 10am. They wiped down all counters after each customer. Everyone has mask and hand sanitizer at each counter. Felt safe and great customer service!!! Highly recommend</review>

<Time>1606464904795</Time><Text>Went into BestBuy at the 181 Curtner Ave. San Jose location Monday 11/23/20 a little before 12PM to return an online order due to wrong item being sent to me. I ordered an iPad Pro 11 128GB but upon opening the package slightly I seen the “32GB” on the box.

So here’s how it went:
Got there and the clerk took my information down but then had to call somebody to authorize it. Comes in Ernesto Ruvalcaba Gonzalez. Looks at the item and says “this is the item you ordered” I preceded to TELL and SHOW him the order # assigned from my BestBuy account online. Not listening to a word I said, he continues “on the item is your order# and this is what you ordered”

Then he prints up the order summary from the item I brought in to return and shows it... First off it wasn’t the order# I gave him, the Person’s name isn’t mines. The address was in South Carolina!

That’s when he finally asked for my name and finally took my order number down. Then he says says “I don’t know how you got this, you shouldn’t have received this item, you were sent this by mistake and yours should be arriving tomorrow,”. Only by basing that on the summary’s deliver by date... I told him this is the package they sent me and that is the wrong item inside..

Then he has the audacity to say “ to me that’s just an envelope”
Not listening to a word I was saying again......are you kidding me??!? The tracking# assigned to the iPad I was supposed to receive is on the envelope..... how is it just an envelope?

Ernesto then takes the iPad and starts walking away. I had to ask him for his card since he didn’t want to give me any confirmation that my order will be delivered “tomorrow”.

Now i'm left without an iPad to return to BestBuy.com via FedEX option online and with a estimated $877 charge on my credit card.< /Text>< Name>

<text>I sometimes wonder if their name isn't just clever marketing. Are these Hue bulbs really the best buy? Could my money have gone somewhere better? What's their research to back up such a bold statement? 4 stars.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

they owed me a refund for a speaker I returned.
I couldnt go get my refund for like 3 weeks I showed up today and they gave me my money no questions asked even tho they had already restocked the speaker I needed, they still gave me the option to take the speaker or the refund.
I was pleased with their service today !
I be back to buy my next electronics...</review>

< review>
Good selection of audio and video consumer products.  Not to good on computers and peripherals.  Big thumbs up on the Geek Squad... they've always been able to troubleshoot and repair the computer hardware issues I've experienced.

Just wished their prices were a little closer to Amazon, but don't mind paying a little extra to help keep the brick and mortar open.</review>

I'm glad I could easily found and shop for all that I wanted in here. The goods were well displayed which makes it easy to find. The store personnel who attended to me was very customer-friendly  and was of great help.

There is option of either paying with cash or credit card.< /Text>

I love this location and the workers here are amazing! Teresa gets the job done! She helped with my issue with what felt like it took days to solve but she got it done and I'm so thankful for her. Will easily be coming to this best buy over the others in the area.< /review>

This location is more laid-back than some of the other Best buy locations. Good place for people to go to shop if you have social anxiety. The returned item experiences less intense and they spend more time with you.< /Text>

In the era of Amazon, it's impressive and refreshing that Best Buy has found a way to stay relevant. I visited today to pick up a replacement TV after Amazon shipping broke the first one, and I found prices noticeably better than Amazon on things like smart-home goodies, and TVs of course. Surprisingly, I can say I'll be back!</Review>

I haven’t been to Best Buy in a long time. The last Best Buy  I went to was in Milpitas. It took so long to get help I walked out and didn’t come back for awhile. Best Buy has improved customer service dramatically. Finally! Someone realized that it’s the connection with customers will keep them coming back.
Everywhere I turned there was Best Buy representative asked if I needed help.
I highly recommend the Best Buy on Curtner.</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>They had a friendly and welcoming atmosphere upon entering. I was asked multiple times if I had been helped. I was there to buy a t.v. When I was being helped by the first person I asked a question he said without hesitation  that he didn't  know the answer but would get someone who did. The person he brought to help me was extremely knowledgeable and explained thoroughly what you get from the different brands at different price points. He helped me pick the one best to suit my needs and advised me when the difference in the newer more expensive model was not worth the extra $ and I wouldn't notice a difference. He helped pick out a sound bar and saved me about $200 by getting a package deal. Great experience!<//review>< pictures>

Went here to buy a TV. Only 1 person working there as far as I could see. Waited 15 minutes for someone to help me then gave up. Not all bad though, figured out what TV I want. Now I'll order it on Amazon. Need people working there to sell stuff.< /text>

Anything and everything I would go in for they wouldn't have in store. They always tell me it's online, pointless to have one of the best electronic store close to me and them never have what I want when I go.< /text>

My boyfriend and I came into this Best Buy to purchase a new drone that we had been saving up for. When we got in someone assisted us immediately which was nice because we weren't exactly sure where the drones were located in the store. I believe the man who helped us was Jim, I can't remember, but for the sake of this review we'll call him Jim. Jim showed us the drone we were looking for and even told us about a drone that had previously been opened so we could get an open box discount. Jim helped us out tremendously and we ended up saving some money in the end! I recommend using this store for your next purchase!<//review>

<Review>1st time in that location. Nice an old very helpful employees, nice greeting at the door.
I found what we looking for and the employee who assisted me was nice.
Only one thing, she was more interesting in promoting Best Buy guaranty service than explain the product that I looking for.
Guys stop to pushing custumers....
Thank you< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< gmap_id>

The reason  for this star is because LITERALLY NO ONE was able to help. I went looking for a sound bar asking for info on two I chose and what the differences were and the two guys that "supposedly" helped only told me the difference in price..lol I can see the price tag..customer service is horrible in this location...</text>

The standard Best Buy experience. Store is set up nicely and finding what you need isn't difficult. There is more than enough parking here and is well lit. My trips here have been normal, nothing extraordinary but also nothing negative at this time.  It does have a public restroom.</review>

<Review>There was a price discrepancy between the phone carrier activations.  Verizon's was actually more expensive than the unlocked showed online, but after we expressed or frustrations, the manager gave us the the advertised price for unlocked.  We are thankful for good understanding. :)< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808e3316b820b6ed:0x4161ce5586427bfb< /gmapID></record>

This Best Buy has the best employees. They see repeat customers and recognize them. They always greet you like they see you every day, and are always smiling. I love coming to this location. Whenever I go in, I'm always greeted by name by several people.<//text>

Well sorted electronics shop. Entrance is wheelchair accessible. The staff was really serviceminded and helped me from the first second I entered the store.  Had a couple of questions and they helped me to choose. Prices are aligned with what you would find in online stores. This would be a good choice to visit if you are in need of some electronics and need help deciding what to buy.

They have the full sortiment of Google and Google nest products.< /review>

Busy on Sunday after Black Friday, but not too bad. Had an online order and went here to pick it up. Only a couple people in front of me in line, but around a dozen in the returns line. Overall pretty smooth for a busy weekend. No problems with my transaction.< /Review>

Customer service in the beginning was Horrible. The person doing returns just walked away from desk. No I will be back or someone will assist you. Nothing. Even one of the ladies there did not know where he went when i asked after 10-15  mins just standing there.  Once they realized he was not coming back ahe jumped in and assisted us. Line was only 4 of us too. Not good.</Review>

Best Buy is a great store to shop at. There is always plenty of friendly and helpful faces.  I was making a fairly large purchase of a new TV set and I was able to get multiple people willing to provide their opinions and information about the different tv's. They went above and beyond and helped me take everything to my car when I was done inside the store.  Very happy and would recommend this store to anyone.</Review>

< review>
Went there yesterday to talk to the Geek Squad. They were pretty helpful. Be prepared to leave your computer for a couple of days if you have a major problem. Their service plan is bad if you intend to install appliances and need computer work. I bought all my kitchen appliances there last winter. Very good deals on major brands.</review>

They used to help out great back then. Now they just point towards what your looking for and hope you find it.. When you do find it & need help they make you wait for a pritty long time..< /Text>

Pretty much the place to go to buy new electronics. Not as wide or specific options as other places but great condition, great financing, and great choices. Not always the best prices but they price match so it doesn't matter.< /Review>

They seriously need to hire people with better customer service skills! After being ignored by one clerk, I asked another clerk a question, and without saying anything, they walked away. I thought I was supposed to follow them, but they just found someone else to help me, who of course didn't have a clue. So I left.
I gave Best Buy 2 stars because I've had good experiences at other locations.<//review>

<text>This Best Buy is located in The Plant Shopping Center next to PetSmart.  The store is very clean and the employees are friendly and helpful.  I usually visit this store for their video games and an occasional small appliance replacement. I noticed on my last visit that they had specialty shops and services, like Geek Squad, Apple Shop, Microsoft Store, Trade-In and car installation services. I recommend this Best Buy location.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Everyone is super helpful and look you in the face when they talk to you. Only issue I had was that they pass you off to each other like it's a game and they try to chat with their customers a little too much. It's cool when you're the customer they're talking to but it sucks when you're the customer waiting 30 minutes for help on looking for an item.<//Review>

My Son and I went to Best Buy to buy for him one of those Mini Projector that you can connect to your phone and point it to any surface and and watch a movie from a 32" size image to a 65" image anywhere you would like to see a movie or just about anything, but they didn't have one at the store but were able to order one for him with free Delivery right to the house, What better Deal can you get than thatand the help we got and the Discount we also received make it even a Sweeter Deal how can you pass that up, Great Friendly Employees working there, Thank You So Much and we will be Back again and again, Delores and Rodrigo Tinoco from San Jose, Ca< /Text>

Everyone there was extremely helpful. Rare to find a store without a bunch of rude kids running it in the evening. If they don't have what we need they order it from another store and have it there ASAP.</review>

<Review>Seems like most people just yeah yeah yeah. Even after I have explained that I have a 10% discount and some reward points I would to use. But in the end he still charges me the full price with nothing applied. SMH...then he told me to return it tomorrow and re-buy it again with the promotion I had under my account. 😡😡😡< /Review>< date>

<Review>Excelente place and friendly staff, honestly. I do feel like Best Buy and a lot of stores in general have way too much selection for apple phones and not much for anything else. If you don't have an iPhone or Samsung don't bother. But other than that it's definitely an excellent place to shop.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>This location is lazy, unprofessional, and doesn’t give a care about customer service.
I had ordered a dishwasher for my ill grandmother since her dishwasher had been broken for a long time. This was on Sunday the 27th. I was able to schedule an appointment for delivery and installation for October 30th.
Well, the 30th arrived and I get a phone call from the installer, Anthony, stating that he had gone to the store and they didn’t have the dishwasher yet. Looking online, it had showed the appointment was for 8am to 12pm, when in reality, the appointment was actually set for 12pm to 4pm. Anthony said he saw that on his end too, so we could wait a little bit and he would check back with me.
I decided to call 888BESTBUY to try to find out where my order was. After a little bit of digging and calling around, I was assured by a lady over the phone that my order was on the truck and ready for delivery and installation; That the ETA was 2:30pm.
About 2pm, I get a call from Anthony that he was at the store a second time to check on where this dishwasher was. It still was not at the store. He told me that the store was supposed to have called me the night before to let me know so that we weren’t just waiting around all day for an order that was never going to arrive. I never received such a phone call. I let Anthony know that the lady over the phone told me that the delivery and installation was supposed to be in about a half hour, and that everything looked fine on her end.
I decided to call 888BESTBUY again to figure out what the heck was going on.
I got help from a wonderful lady named Sammi, who was able to dig around even more and even contacted Anthony directly as well. They together figured out that the San Jose (Plant location) made a mistake by not contacting me the night before, nor did they contact me the day of. There was absolutely no communication.
Sammi explained to me that when Anthony spoke to the manager, they said that my order was in a different city and they had to fill out a form, which was supposed to have been done the day before when they were supposed to call me anyway. So it’s just more of the whole people not doing their damn job.
Sammi said that I shouldn’t have been able to schedule delivery and installation so soon, that it was supposed to black out certain days.
The only apology I got was from Sammi, who did absolutely nothing wrong. She was actually the one that helped me reschedule for a later date for delivery and installation to make certain we will get our dishwasher.
I am extremely unhappy. I made a trip out of state to California to be here with my grandmother and get a few things done to lighten the load on her. She is very sick and all of this is going to put more stress on her. I am only here for a few days.
I don’t understand why my order isn’t here when it was supposed to be or what exactly happened in general because I never got direct answers. I’m not sure what city the dishwasher is in currently or why.
I feel like someone didn’t do their job and I’m the one paying for it.
Avoid this place at all costs.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

I was just picking online order. Should have just bought in store, would have been much faster. Associate helping online order pick up line was way too slow. There were 4 people ahead of me and I had to wait around 20 mins until I was helped. Line kept growing behind me and there were around 15 people behind me. It took them this long to realize that and only then opened additional registers.</text>

Had a great experience. Bought a fridge here. They had a great selection in their dent and Scratch selection of floor models. JP and Dennis helped me in the appliance section and were very helpful and not pushy. They also got me a great deal. I'll go back here to buy my PS4, just because of the great selection.<//review>

Sammi explained to me that when Anthony spoke to the manager, they said that my order was in a different city and they had to fill out a form, which was supposed to have been done the day before when they were supposed to call me anyway. So it’s just more of the whole people not doing their damn job.
Sammi said that I shouldn’t have been able to schedule delivery and installation so soon, that it was supposed to black out certain days.
The only apology I got was from Sammi, who did absolutely nothing wrong. She was actually the one that helped me reschedule for a later date for delivery and installation to make certain we will get our dishwasher.
I am extremely unhappy. I made a trip out of state to California to be here with my grandmother and get a few things done to lighten the load on her. She is very sick and all of this is going to put more stress on her. I am only here for a few days.
I don’t understand why my order isn’t here when it was supposed to be or what exactly happened in general because I never got direct answers. I’m not sure what city the dishwasher is in currently or why.
I feel like someone didn’t do their job and I’m the one paying for it.
Avoid this place at all costs.<//Text>

Good deals occasionally but most stuff at best buy is overpriced.  This location is not quite as nice as other best buys.  Can be hard to get help or find items due to general lack of organization.  Still good for picking up sale items you might find online.<//Text>

Trading in the laptop made me feel like I owe the female customer service rep money. No smile from beginning to end.
At least the store greeter did his job.
Parking space was nice.< /review>

<Text>I've been going to this best buy for gaming headsets for the past four years. Not only do they have great gaming headsets but they have an excellent two year replacement plan for them.

Just today I returned a headset I had a warranty on and they accepted it and let me put the money of not only the headset but the protection plan towards the new headset I was going to get. It was a fast and easy process and the man helping me was very sweet.

The unfortunate part was they no longer carried the exact same model of headset I am rather fond of, but I was able to easily get help from one of the on floor associates to see if there was any of that headset around at other stores, there wasn't so I went with the next best thing that was closest to the price of the headset I'd gotten.

I highly recommend that if you are someone who goes through a lot of headsets, go to Best Buy and get their two year warranties, an extra $10 or so is worth it in the long run for the expensive headsets< /Text><time>1499996877318<//time>< pics>

Getting real help can be difficult some times. If you know what you want then you'll be fine.  I came to this place once to purchase a smart watch.  I asked an employee get me one which was locked up behind a case.  He said he'll get someone to help.  The employee left and I stood there for 20 minutes.  I decided to leave and ended up buying the watching on Amazon instead.< /text>

The store was well stocked and we'll staffed as Best Buys are. This store had Lots of employees With No Service. We finally found what we were looking for randomly placed in multiple locations. Check-Out was an excruciating wait, with only one person ahead of us and 5 behind us, and the Cashier was very rude. It should not be so hard to give them money. Now I know why #Amazon is doing so well.</review>

Time and time again the staff in the Mobile department can solve any issue that is due to the carriers faults. Always leave happy when I buy new phones here.This is the only place I go to to make my phone upgrades. Apart from knowing their stuff they are friendly and kind. They have a great Mobile team at this Best Buy.<//review>

Went there to buy tablets, Ali was the guy who helped me, i am a hard customer to deal with when i buy electronics, but Ali was very patient with me he explained in details, everything about each tablet i looked at, he gave me a great price match on the tablet and on the case, also he helped me redeem my previouse reward points towards my purchase. Also he showed me new all-in-one desktops and explained the details about them for me, definitely will be going back to get two of them for my work office.<//review>

This is the best place to begin and end your quest for electronic devices. T.V.,  computers,  cell phones, cameras, etc, etc. Skip the online stores and actually see, touch, and have actual customer service at your local Best Buy. Pretty sure that they price match and offer extended warranties.< /Review>

Make sure you check price online again. I want to buy a Dyson V10 absolute and the price tag on the shelf show it's $599 while the bestbuy online showed it's $525. Reason: the price for online store is automatically updated once the administrator update it and the price tag need labor to update them and you might do the purchase before they put the right tag. It's not just best buy, it might happen to all others.</Review>

In store pick ups can become the biggest inconvenience at this location. The computers this best buy uses are slower than a snail and are incapable of getting customer order information. I waited an hour only for them to tell me that my order had not yet passed the "fraud check" after receiving an email telling me the order was waiting for pick up. What in the world is a fraud check for an in store pick up? Incompetent.</Review>

< Review>
If all customers receive the same level of customer service that we did I wouldn’t be surprised to see the store go out of business very soon. We went in for an rca cable and knew exactly what we needed and explained to two separate salespeople what we needed. The first was obviously new so I can understand that she didn’t know and asked someone else. She was pleasant enough. The next who was supposed to be an expert brought out something else and when we told him it wasn’t what we needed and explained to him again what we were looking for, he said “I don’t know what you want” and walked away shaking his head. What a coincidence that we went to frys and found exactly what we needed without attitude from someone who obviously doesn’t deserve the job he has.< /Review>

I don't entirely remember if he introduced himself but he helped me with a purchase of six samsung tablets and cases for a show I was helping out on. Both he and his manager were happy to price match and applied an additional discount to the cases which ended up saving me a solid $200.

<Rating>2< /Rating><Review>The place was decent, But!! Some of the staff were too aggressive trying to upsell before they could even close the sale !Went in to buy car stereo speakers,But!,The guy did not know what he was talking about but he kept trying to upsell and shows the most expensive speakers.so we got a quote instead!, went to a place down the road got the same exact speakers & everything done for a fraction of the price including installation!!! Same Exact brand literally everything exactly the same and everything that the guy at Best Buy was trying to upsell and charged extra was basically included with the installation. From the place I found down the road !!!! So for the money we saved went back to Best Buy bought a 70 inch TV open box but as soon as the cash hit the register the same thing started happening so aggressive trying to upsell warrantee,HDMI cables and as soon as I told him I had everything already top-of-the-line HDMI‘s and cord extensions to protect against surges like a pack of hyenas so aggressive. They all kept trying to upsell warranties and 1 guy started trashing the same HDMI cables he was just trying to up-sell me a minute ago!!!!
Too aggressive with the up-sales!!. I used to be in customer service and used to work for a plumbing company so I know exactly their tactics. It almost most seem like they were working for An extra bonus for everything they upsell or even commission! They need to talk to their sales staff during their monthly/biweekly meetings bogus up sales and aggressive tactics to upsell !!!!< /Review>< pics>

ABSOLUTE WORST PLACE TO BUY ANYTHING, THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED ON THREE DIFFERENT VISITS IN THE PAST WEEK, WILL NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!

THIS PLACE REALLY NEEDS TO INVEST IN EMPLOYEES WHO ACTUALLY GIVE A DAM ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS AND WANT TO HELP, INSTEAD OF IMPLYING THAT SOMEONE WILL TRY AND LIE AND BEAT THE SYSTEM JUST BECAUSE THEY HAD THAT EXPERIENCE.

I WAS GOING TO SPEND ROUGHLY $3,000 ON MY VISIT THERE TODAY, EVERYTHING WAS IN STOCK BUT THE BOX THE TV WAS IN (ON THE SALES FLOOR) WAS PRETTY MANGLED UP AND THEY SAID THEY WONT RETURN OR REPLACE A TV IF THE SCREEN IS BROKEN. I POINTED OUT THE VERY MANGLED BOX AND THAT IS WHEN I GOT A VERY BAD ATTITUDE FOR SOME STRANGE REASON.

JUST BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE BEEN 1 OR 2 PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRIED TO MOUNT A TV ON THE WALL WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND THE TV ENDED UP FALLING AND CRACKING THE SCREEN DOESNT MEAN THEY SHOULD TALK TO EVERY OTHER SINGLE PERSON IN A VERY DEMEANING MANOR. THESE PEOPLE DONT KNOW WHO THEY ARE TALKING TO WHEN THEY TALK ANY RANDOM PERSON THAT WALKS IN THE DOOR!

WE INSTEAD WENT TO TARGET RIGHT NEXT DOOR OF ALL PLACES, THE ELECTRONICS EMPLOYEE WAS VERY HELPFUL AND FRIENDLY AND WE ENDED UP SPENDING A LITTLE OVER $3,000.<//text>

<text>I drive 25 miles 1-way to get the excellent service I receive each time I visit. I'm greeted with smiles & courtesy. Today I was assisted by Geek Squad associate NICK who knows more than anyone I've met & he helped me out from a dilemma I've been struggling with for a week on my own.  Without judgement, but rather with helpful clues for the future he quickly assessed the problem & effectively solved the difficulty. I will never go elsewhere for my computer needs or hurdles. Best Buy has helped me out for years when I wanted a Samsung TV & refrigerator too. Their quality is unsurpassed matching the experienced store associates who always have time for me.  I know this young man will go far in his career because of his excellence in delivering service.< /text><name>tweety2055< /name></record>

Good prices the thing I like is that they will sell you an open box items not just rewrapped items that's used and sell it to you  like it's new or something like all the other stores the service is great and the other thing
I like the most about Best buy is that you can get your receipt through email great place good deals and true to there customers.</text>

Cornelius claim there was a dent in the laptop. I ask to see the dent he point to a spot on the laptop that had no dent. I said I don't see a dent he look a me and said okay I still can't exchange the laptop. I went over alamden and exchange my laptop. The manager look over the laptop and said I have no ideal where he saw the dent. I will drive the extra miles to shop a best buy. I will no longer be shopping at the curtner site.

The manager of this best buy was rude, mean and unprofessional. All I asked him was if he can knock off a few $ because of a couple of dents in an open box item and he said he could but won't in an unprofessional way and walked away. I discourage people from going to this store.
I hope the management replaces him with someone with more decency.</Text>

<review>Very rude!! Horrible customer service!!! I had to look for a representative myself. No one greets or acknoledges customers. I went to buy a cellphone and the offer posted for the cellphone was not honored. Alex the representative said "I think the offer its  expired, let me check." He checked and the offer was expired but very rude ripped the sign. He did not apologize or anything. I asked for the manager and he came to talk to me. He didnt have a name badge and he was rude too!!  I questioned why the sign was there and why alex ripped the sign like that. The manager said it was atts job to remove the signs. Tons of signs were expired in the store. Good luck with weights and measures!! I will take my business somewhere else.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Terrible store. I went there to buy a camera and 90% of the display cameras were missing, no staff around to ask questions and customers complaining out loud about how terrible the store is. I even heard one guy tell his friend "why do we have to come to this Best Buy? This is the crappy one."</text>< name>

<text>Very rude!! Horrible customer service!!! I had to look for a representative myself. No one greets or acknoledges customers. I went to buy a cellphone and the offer posted for the cellphone was not honored. Alex the representative said "I think the offer its  expired, let me check." He checked and the offer was expired but very rude ripped the sign. He did not apologize or anything. I asked for the manager and he came to talk to me. He didnt have a name badge and he was rude too!!  I questioned why the sign was there and why alex ripped the sign like that. The manager said it was atts job to remove the signs. Tons of signs were expired in the store. Good luck with weights and measures!! I will take my business somewhere else.< /text>< date>

stopped selling cd's in July, now the only music media sold is on actual VINYL RECORD ALBUMS! (For the RECORD PLAYERS they sell, I was told...) Records to CD's to Records...Retro-Tech? More like Back-track Tech... (pun intended)
Not too big a selection to choose from, and a little pricey...
They do still carry DVD's & Games.< /text>

<Review>Go to the Santana Row, Almaden or Gilroy locations instead.

Not a complete selection of anything. Half a usual store.

Bad experiences price matching:
1. Refused to price match an open-box item against a new in-box item online. Came back a month later and got the item for even cheaper than I originally tried to price match it.
2. Price match of a phone case on Black Friday was refused, so I went to a different Best Buy a few days later and got the case for even less.

Both times this store lost out on money it would have otherwise made.</Review>< Resp>

I decided to use the best buy 18 months interest free financing to purchase about $4200 worth of appliances on november 6th. Delivery was scheduled for november 9th.
I  called back the next day to change the delivery address (forgot to say I am moving from an apartment to my new house), they said since i changed the address the delivery window was no longer available (both addresses about 2.5 miles apart) and would have to be rescheduled.

Rescheduled for the following week between 8-12pm. no one showed up, driver calls to say "oh i have 12-4". I said no, was already on my way to go empty out old apartment, so had to toss all my frozen stuff.
went to best buy, cancelled the transaction and gave them back the free google chrome.
Someone called Angie called and I agreed to get re-delivery on the 24th.
delivery went smooth, no issues. all is well, then I get an  email from best buy credit card (CITI) today and they say "you missed  the first payment on december 2nd so you are charged a late fee" I went ape nuts.

I  dont have a bill yet, how can I be late, I had even written a letter to them saying my purchase date was changed to the 24th not the 6th. they say they only go by the order date, irrespective of wether you actually receive the items.  I refused to pay the late fee, paid the balance off and closed the account.
The one star is for their staff (they were all great) and the products (love my whirlpool washer, dryer and samsung fridge, also got a dyson vaccum cleaner and iphone x).  the entire experience was tedious and stressfull, I had been thinking of making best buy my go-to place for stuff but i think ill stick with amazon.<//Review>

Location is a bit hidden in the Mcarthy Ranch area. Being near by the waste business at 237 freeway, I usually walk quick to get into the store because the air reeks really bad and when I would finish shopping, I would rush to my car for the same reason. The place is sometimes dead but, that means usually their products are in stock then. Save yourself some time, call to check if what ever item you want is in stock before driving up there. The service is great, sucks that they can't really help you with credit card issues like increasing the limit, they only can sign you up for it. Citi Bank is the credit issuer towards their store credit card so, look out for that. Till then, their employees are friendly and helpful, sometimes they look like theyre over working for a somewhat empty store.< /Text>

Long story long I arrived on bad terms and left on good terms. After coming to the understanding that the warranty for my problem was up to the manufacturer Lenovo and not a liability of Best Buy, the Geek Squad associate Kevin politely informed me that anything that could be done to fix the problem immediately would be over his head, as the problem was with a workstation urgency was present. In steps the General Manager Kellie Adams.

She laid out what Best Buy policies are and being an understanding person I accepted that I bought a low-end computer and we got what we paid for. What she did say was that she would do whatever was in her power to make sure that I walked out that door happy.

The positive attitude of Kevin and Kellie turned me from being someone that did not plan on ever coming back to Best Buy to someone who walked out the door with a purchase of two new workstations. I have a growing company and I know where I will be going for hardware from now on.

It's easy to find the motivation to write a bad review, it takes a lot for me to find it worth my time to write a positive one. If management is reading this take notes.< /text>

I hatr the fact that they have a price on the site, and another in the store. If you don't say anything, they will simply charge you the one in the store, that it is higher. If you say anything, they will sell it at the price on the net.<//Text>

They will price match any electronic device from other stores. If the item you're looking for is not in stock, they'll check the other stores in the area for that item.</review>

{'time': 1558385425454, 'text': "Hello Mark,\n\nThanks for voicing your store experience. At Best Buy, we strive to carry a wide variety of products to fit our customers' needs and are disheartened to discover our in-store selection didn't house what you were looking for. Myself going through similar situations I, too, can understand products are conveniently available for purchase. We encourage you to visit BestBuy.com or our Best Buy Mobile app where you'll notice a vast selection of products available to order for Store Pickup or Ship-to-Home to prevent any future distress. While on our website, you can also check the current stock of items sold at your local Best Buy locations before you make the trip into the store. Thanks for shopping at our San Jose Best Buy, and we hope to see you again.\n\nBest Regards,\nBri\nBest Buy Support"}<//response>

<Text>Do not buy an appliance from them or at least don't have it installed by them.  I bought a clothes washer last weekend and had it delivered and installed on Tuesday.

I'd give a 0 if I could.  The service is horrendous and unprofessional.  Me and a customer service member were on a phone with a representative, and we were waiting on  the corporate office reps for an answer; the guy with the phone decides to take it off speaker,  walks to the desks at the back for a second and comes back saying "Oh they hung up" forcing me to leave.  Nothing else, I'm like really?  Waste my time and nothing happens.< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Bad service in deliveries and facilities, you pay for one service and they give you another, they tell you a date and it is the day that they do not arrive, I am waiting now, and I already regretted buying in this store ... let's see when they feel like it to install my purchases ... and when you call they cannot help you or give explanations of why they could not do it ... and now to wait for them to say when they install it, and it does not matter if it works or not, they tell you and we will have to stop making your plans and I just hope that they tell us 1 day before because they did not notify and I lost the day by waiting ...

I just wanted to buy a smartwatch from samsung and I asked a salesman if he could give the price of one that was on display ps he did not have what it was worth and the man just told me that "it cost a lot". and I just said ok thanks ps did not give me the price. Then I went with another person and asked him for help and he answered me "a moment please" I said ok. Then the man came back but with another client ignoring me completely. and I told him hey, I just want to know how much a clock costs, he told me again to wait. I agreed, and came back with another client. I got upset and told him I just want to know the price of a smartwatch, you think I do not have to pay you. Maybe I'm arrogant but I do not know how to answer. that they care if it is expensive or cheap they should only limit themselves to do their work and if they do not want to be asked ps put a price on their articles. I had a very bad taste in my mouth this time. and at the end of everything I left very angry that I did not buy anything because nobody wanted to help me. thanks best buy.

(Original)
bueno hoy si tuve una mala experiencia en su tienda de best buy planta shopping center. yo solo quería comprar un smartwatch de samsung y le pregunte a un vendedor que si podía dar el precio de un que estaba en display ps no tenía cuanto valía y el hombre se limitó a decirme que “costaba mucho”. y solo dije ok gracias ps no me dio el precio. después fui con otra persona y le pedí ayuda y me contesto “ un momento por favor” dije ok . luego el hombre volvió pero con otro cliente ignorándome por completo. y le dije oye solo quiero saber cuánto cuesta un reloj , me volvió a decir que lo esperar. accedí, y volvió con otro cliente. me moleste y le dije solo quiero saber el precio de un smartwatch, crees que no tengo conque pagarte. talvez sone prepotente pero no se me hace correcto su forma de contestar. que les importa si es caro o barato ellos solo se deben limitar hacer su trabajo y si no quieren que les pregunten ps pónganle precio a sus artículos. me quede con muy mal sabor de boca esta vez. y al final de todo me salí muy enojada que no compre nada porque nadie me quiso ayudar. gracias best buy.</review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>
