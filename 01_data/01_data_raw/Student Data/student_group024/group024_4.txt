I recently went to mobile makeover to get my car serviced and cleaned, it was a very pleasant experience. The detail on my vehicle was outstanding not to mention the service was quick and professional. I really liked the fact that they took the time to hand wash my vehicle. The detail and service was worth every penny, I will definitely be a returning customer and I highly recommend mobile makeover to everyone in the area!<//review>

<Text>Great group of people. They are always offering me discounts, so friendly and always willing to explain things to me. My first experience was through Groupon but it hasn't stopped there. I only bring my car here because I know they will be honest, work quickly,  and do quality work. They are always asking how products and services worked when I come for my next oil change. I would definitely refer them.<//Text>< user_name>

They explain everything in a way that make sense and then still allow for you to make the decisions without feeling like you're having to pay for something you don't really need. I also mentioned that I was on a budget and they helped out in that way also. Definitely will be using them again.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Name>

Great people, awesome, quick service, and reasonable prices. Made an appointment for the next day, arrived an hour late, and they still honored my appointment and changed my oil right on the spot. They did a 21-pt. inspection, checked my brakes, fluids, etc., and told me what work needed to be done. I know they're honest because I do a lot of my own engine and brake work and everything they said was right in line with what I now I've been neglecting!

They serviced my car with great care and they knew all the components in my vehicle. i have never experienced true, professional, and honest mechanics as in Mobile Makeover. They will give you confidence that your vehicle will be in good hands and never give you outrageous quotes like those other mechanics. I will highly recommend getting your next diagnostic with Mobile Makeover.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<review>Got a Living Social coupon for $19.99 for oil change and complete diagnostic on car.  Made and appointment and took it over today. Note this takes around 1 & 1/2 hours to do so it is not a Jiffy Lube.

The place is the front shop on the right when you are looking at it.  The guys took really good care of my car and I am very pleased with the shop and the work.</review>< user>

<review>It can be very tiresome trying to find honest mechanics when you have a Range Rover, a car that is safe but has to be taken care of on a regular basis.  I have gone through the mill, being quoted astronomical prices when all that was needed was a mechanic that cared about finding out exactly what was wrong with my car.  I saved so much going to Chris and Mobile Makeover.  My car is running absolutely amazing and I can now feel secure with knowing where to take my car whenever I have an issue.</review>< Pictures>

I don't go out very often to places like these. But with someone whom is really introverted, this mechanic shop really made me feel welcome. From a friendly environment to a wonderful atmosphere with a surplus of friendliness, I feel like this is the shop for me, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for vehicle repair/check ups.</Text>

I can highly recommend Mobile Makeover! I was on a road trip and got a problem with my engine in Los Angeles. They fixed it in time and made a good price, so that I could continue my journey with a good feeling. They gave me rides from and to my bnb. They are open, honest and professional. By the way, they even washed my car before I got it back :-)</text>

I am not one that felt I could trust auto shops but this place is different. They are friendly, professional, honest and don't charge an arm and a leg! Going back to have my brakes done!<//Review>

<Review>Got some work done on my car recently & one thing can be said about the mobile makeover crew. They care about their customers. They were kind enough to give me a ride home so I wouldn't be stuck there & got the job done right.

<text>My daughter bought me a groupon deal, and I'm so glad she did.  I asked Chris if he could top my oil change a quart low because I wanted to add some Lucas oil treatment and he didn't carry it.  He said he couldn't do that and then told me he carried another brand.  When he saw my hesitation, he didn't make me feel stupid because I was some dumb broad.  He immediately offered me the solution to go down on the corner and by some Lucas and he'd put it in.  Their customer service was outstanding, everything was so clean, and their prices were very reasonable.  He took the time to explain things to me so I could understand and make an informed decision.  I'll definitely go back!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

This is a shop where you can feel comfortable taking any of my cars for any level of work. but in this sea of rip off artiest and shitty workmanship - this is the place where you will be confident in giving your keys and trust to them. this is the place where you have a FRIEND.

and even better - this place does a PROPER detail cleaning on your car.
Lambo - Ferrari - or Honda. they have you covered. pro's from start to finish.</Text>

< review>
I found Mobile Makeover through Groupon! They offered the best deal listed and when I booked my appointment they were informative and courteous! The service didn't take long and stayed inside the estimated 45 minutes for an oil change and 21 pt inspection. I had the option of waiting in the shop or to checkout some of the stores in the near by shopping center. They not only told me what needed to be fixed, but explained what it meant, offered me a deal (without an expiration) because I came in on the Groupon AND refused to take advantage of the fact that I was a woman and pressure me into using their service. I took my time and checked the prices and my usual spot and some others and realized they AGAIN were offering me the best deal for a service that is really just part of routine maintenance!

I'm booking with them again and if you looking for quality meets affordability you'll find it here!< /review>

This place was great find, I came in through Groupon deal for $20 and instead of just getting an oil change, I got a complete car checkup for the same price! What really sold me was that they are honest people running this business, will be coming back for future checkups.< /review>

I've been here twice now and the service is great.  The manager helps a lot and provides price estimate on anything your car needs or may need in the future.</Text>

<gmapID>0x80c29b992a8ee4db:0x2cffa756a1a8df31<//gmapID><text>this groupon is a scam .. they dont honor it and charge double citing extra costs.. 20$ groupon will be 35$ for regular sedans here.. walmart or sears is cheaper and straight forward..

the owner asks many people to write google review and yelp review .. consider this .. he gives discount to 1 or 2 customers a day and ask them to write google and yelp review then and there .. thats how he has so many good reviews..

But I feel some what guilty now because the mechanic is good, though pricey .. 125$/hour .. this would have been 3 star review as I had average experience, but to somewhat negate false 5 star reviews,  I am going with 1 star..owner uses all tactics in the book to get business .. false ads to bring people to the shop, "do you want to kill yourself or kill others?" kind of talk ..

My Verdict: If you dont find a GOOD and fair priced mechanic elsewhere, you CAN come here.

one more thing, he wont give a quote with estimated costs.. so that we can research the prices .. He says all that info will be in the bill .. which is true .. but people want QUOTE.. estimated costs in writing..because common people don't understand all the jargon when you speak..(everyone knows you intentionally use that jargon)<//text>< Pics>

I went in for an oil change they didn't screw the oil cap back on at all it wasn't even on it. Oil all over the drive way, oil splattered all over under the hood, just hoping I noticed it in time before any real damage was done</Text>

<Review>Hands down one of the best ballparks in the country! There is something for everyone, even if you're not a die hard baseball nut! I have loved my experience conversing with the ushers, they have such a love of the Giants, and take such pride in their jobs. The food is incredible, every palate is guaranteed to be satisfied... Sometimes I just enjoy walking the loop around the ballpark, people watching and looking out over the bay. Its just beautiful! Makes me happy every time I come here! Go Giants!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Great service, lovely hosts, wonderful inventive food, and a nice if limited wine list. Every time we go to North Beach we end up here. Have been here 3 times and always surprised there isn’t a line around the corner to get a table.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<Review>I even had dessert! I couldn't have enjoyed my meal any more than I did.  From the beginning of my experience,  the staff was gracious, friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The ambiance was reminiscent of an old Italian home and the limited wine selection actually wasn't an issue, due to what they served was great. I had the Persian cucumber and watermelon salad and I could've eaten it again and again. But next came the seared scallops and I was in food nirvana.  I highly recommend this place. And I could kick myself for not getting here sooner.<//Review>< name>

Stupendous. 11/10 recommendation. The ambiance is romantic, the service is personal, and the food is out of this world. Their gnocchi is an absolute must order.<//Review>

In the City from Sacramento.  The eggplant on crostini appetizer was wonderfully flavorful.  Ling cod with poached shrimp also delicious. Servers were excellent and kindly recommended another restaurant near the Orpheum for the following night.  Highly recommend.</review>

<Text>The space is small, intimate, inviting - and that's just the start. The service is top notch - and the food delicious, novel, and and fresh. So much better than those hulking tourist traps further up Columbus - but, to be clear, this place would be somewhere I'd go no matter where it was.< /Text>< resp>

Our favorite!! Super dark, cozy, tiny restaurant with incredible delicious food.  No-nonsense service is straight to the point and not invasive or nagging but helpful.  Glorious wine list.  Fantastic pastas and rotating menu.  We love the ambiance as much as the food.  Somewhat pricey but worth it.  They prefer cash.  Call way ahead for a reservation, they fill up and will not rush you away to entertain other waiting customers.  Maybe this place has 10 or 15 tables.  Tiny and wonderful gem in North Beach.< /Text>

<review>Delicious food; highly recommend the gnocchi if it's on the daily menu. Everything about Da Flora was like a home cooked meal. Waiter's wife was the chef, he talked us through each dish as if he'd made it himself. Great food, great people, great time.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

The best restaurant I've been invited to eat. Small, intimate setting; (seats 32); dining felt more like a family gathering than a restaurant, and the street traffic view is spectacular. On the corner of 701 Columbus, you see families, tourists, and "Only in San Francisco" natives.  Great first date, meet-and-greet, or client spoiling.< /Review>

Had a fantastic meal there this evening. Excellent service, ambiance and the food was very good.

We had the arugula w/ pear salad and the caesar salad (with anchovies, extra on top)... both excellent with homemade dressing.

For mains we had tagliatelle and the pork chop.... both fantastic with the pasta being very fresh and the pork marinated in a brine which resulted in a very tender piece of meat.

The house wines (specifically the Tuscan) were great for our meals and the service was great. The restaurant space is small but not cramped and allows for the servers to focus on the tables they have.

Great place; look forward to coming back!<//Text>

If you only had one choice for dining in SF, this has to be the one to consider for a truly authentic Italian dining experience. Foodies visiting from NYC were blown away by the menu items and we all ended up Sharing a bit from each others plates in a true family dining experience.</Text>

We loved the quaint, romantic feel of this restaurant. You could tell the food was all made from scratch, and it was delicious! Our favorite was the sweet potato gnocchi appetizer. It's a small place, so make sure to get a reservation.< /Review>

This adorable little restaurant is easy to miss even though it's on a prime corner. It is a great spot to grab a bite to eat and people watch while in North Beach.
I got the cream of mushroom soup and the pork chop. The soup was amazing, but the pork chop was a little tough for my taste. The bread they serve is a focaccia bread, but the taste and texture reminded me of a donut...and anyone who has read my reviews will tell you that I love donuts! So in other words, the bread is amaze-balls!
They say they prefer cash but they do except credit cards. It's a nice spot for a date or a casual dining experience. They have wines by the bottle, but not by the glass.</Review>

<Review>Our first time at Da Flora and it was sublime! Quiet, beautiful, convivial space with even better food and terrific wine. Excellent, friendly, knowledgable service. We shared 4 dishes and all were terrific but the pappardelle with zucchini and mint was especially nice.

<text>Wow! Darrin and Jen have a great thing going with da flora. We try to avoid touristy places when traveling, and we hit the jackpot with this place. Some of the best bread I've ever tasted, sweet potato gnocchi was out of this world as was the veal manicotti, pork chop, duck leg agnolotti, dessert, crostini, all 3 salads and short but nice and reasonable wine list. Neighborhood, intimate, quaint, fabulous food, wonderful, flawless service and a fantastic experience! Will be back next year!!!!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Unfortunately, we are not able to allow folks to refill their water bottles in our restroom. We are a small, intimate restaurant, and provide our utilities for our guests. Additionally, it would be a rare occasion that we would be able to accommodate a party of twelve without reservations. So that you know in the future, we are more than happy to host large parties. So you can plan accordingly, the bill for a party that size would be at the low end, at least five hundred dollars before wine. At the high end, around fifteen hundred dollars. Best of luck.'}<//response>

Restaurant is small (seats around 20) and is dimly lit. Very quiet, so not ideal for a first date, but good spot to bring a date you want to get to know better.

Menu is handwritten in cursive and is hard to read, but the food makes up for it.

First, the handmade foccacia bread (free) is delicious. Soft, fluffy, and savory... we asked for seconds and our waitress obliged happily.

For appetizers, we had the arugula pear salad and the sweet potato gnocchi. Salad was light and refreshing - loved the combo of sweet pear and savory cheese. And the sweet potato gnocchi... Oh. My. Goodness. You MUST try it. Amazing. I couldn't stop telling my coworkers about it the next day, and I will definitely bring friends here if just to introduce them to it and the foccacia bread alone. 1.5x the appetizer size would probably be enough for a light dinner, since the gnocchi is fairly heavy. Next time I will definitely consider that.

For my entree, I got the penne rigate with sausage and mushrooms. Portion was relatively small, and quality was just slightly above average. Slightly undercooked pasta, but the sauce was decent.

Service was okay. Our waitress brought us the wrong appetizer at first but apologized for it.

Despite the mediocre entree, I still have to give this place 5 stars for the foccacia, sweet potato gnocchi, and quiet/romantic ambiance and decor. I will definitely bring friends here again soon.

--

EDIT: Brought another friend here for the focaccia and gnocchi. Service was very bad. I called to make a reservation and the lady who answered literally scoffed and said, "Um, Saturday night at 7pm? Not going to happen." I asked if any other times were available. She replied, "Oh, um. Looks like we had a cancellation for 6:30." My friend and I got there and two waitresses were both rude. Water glasses never filled until we asked. Entree (risotto) was not good - I literally didn't touch mine. Revising my review to 4 stars... I was under the spell of focaccia and gnocchi when I wrote my first review.</Text><Time>1422247777751< /Time><pictures>None</pictures>< user>

My 9 yr old and I were very pleased with the quality of the service Wayne provided. I didn’t have to ask many questions because Wayne was very good at explaining everything. I would definitely recommend.</text>

I absolutely love this place!! Wayne is super friendly, professional,  quick with replies if he misses your call, and is very knowledgeable and answered any questions I had. Not only that our home inspector Brian was so knowledgeable. professional,  friendly and definitely made my first home inspection enjoyable.  I was really nervous and he made me feel better . Would recommend 1,000,000 times to anyone.</text>

We had a home that we are buying inspected recently and we noticed that the inspector showed the areas of needed repair but no clear explanation.</Text>

< Review>
Excrement service! We scheduled any appointment for the next day! Additionally, I was emailed information about who was coming and a picture so I knew who to expect. I was offered a variety of services I could include in the home inspection, which was nice. Our inspector arrived 30-45 minutes early, which didnt bother us. He was thorough and efficient in moving from one task to the next. He was friendly and answered our questions. Our report was even ready for us the very next morning!  It came complete with details, explanations, and pictures of everything he observed. All in all great service. I definitely recommend.< /Review>

Really easy to work with and great price for a home inspection. They also offered free home warranty after the inspection. Pretty sweet if you ask me. Thank you All Southland Home Inspections... Totally will recommend.</Text>

This was my buyer's inspection. He  was not rushing to try and get the job and possibly missing something. Took the time to see if I had any questions or concerns. Do to this covid-19 madness we could not sit down and talk about the inspection, I was sent the full report with in a timely manner.</review>

<Review>Greetings!

Wayne and Co. at All Southland Inspections were phenomenal! Efficient,   Professional and Timely, and the Seller made 99 % of the suggested corrections w/ no pushback.

My Wife and I were very pleased as this was our 1st time Buying experience.

All Southland Inspections (And Wayne!) made this normally “dreaded task”,  very comforting and pleasurable.

Many Thanks,

We had Wayne inspect our home that we had sold to FHA buyers and he was very courteous and thorough. So much in fact that we opted to have him inspect the home we purchased. The website is easy to us with the agreements and payments. Their response time via email and phone/text was quick and precise. Thank you so much for all of your help! I highly recommend them.</Review>

We are so thankful for All Southland Home Inspection. Wayne was our inspector and he was thorough and concise. After our inspection, he took at least another 30 minutes to review his findings and address any questions.  The report was delivered promptly which made our home buying process that much easier.</text>

We did inform you that the Seller was working on the unit at the time of the inspection.\n\nNow if there were any items that Brian missed, I would love the feed back so I could reviewed then with him. Since according to you, most inspectors would have caught.\n\nOur inspection did come with a 5 year leak free roof protection, 90 day SewerGuard, 90 day mechanical warranty, 90 day MoldSafe and 90 day Structural coverage.

<UserId.>100128738179535626101< /UserId.><review>I was asked twice to review you guys through email, so here it is. Thanks for "reminding" me!

I was taken advantage of since I was not in town for the inspection. Your inspector (Brian) showed up a half hour early, before my realtor was there and started doing the "inspection". Seems to me he was more concerned about getting the "inspection" done quickly than he was thoroughly.

A major concern with anyone living in the Southern California desert is the cooling system of a house. I was unpleasantly surprised that when it came to the swamp cooler, the report stated that the swamp cooler was not inspected! The inspector didn't even try to turn it on to see if it worked!

When I tried to call Wayne and ask him what the story was behind that,(first time ever having a conversation with him, I was being respectful) he hung up on me! Then when I emailed him, he tells me "Evap coolers are beyond the Scope of the inspection. No inspection standards."

Unbelievable! Funny thing about that is, I was never advised that would be  the case! Because if it was, I would find another home inspector! They knew the house had a swamp cooler!

And he also claimed that he "thought we were done" and he was "at an inspection" when I was trying to talk to him on the phone earlier.. Well, if you were too busy to allegedly talk then maybe you shouldn't of answered in the first place!

To make things worse, now that I've been to the property, I've found that there were quite a few things that this "inspection" didn't catch that most inspectors would of! Some of these were safety concerns! And, of course, the swamp cooler was not working. Not the first time I've had a home I was buying or selling being inspected, so, I know what to expect out of one.

Thanks for just about nothing and making me feel like I wasted almost $400 All Southland!< /review>< Pictures>

Do not hire these.  If I could give no stars I would.  They where at the property for over 3 hours. They didn't even really inspect.  They took a few pictures and said.  "I didn't go up and check the roof but It does need repair." But 10 min later saying that the roof is great guarantee it for 5-10 years (So is it in good condition or not). They where training a new guy but the one with experience was chit chatting with the person and wasn't training the guy properly. The oven worked, but they wanted to check if it works.  And all of a sudden the buttons do not work they broke them.  Home owner was mad!!! Inspector insisted that there was a termite issue (Keep in mind they are not a licensed Termite inspector) made us so worried about it. 2 days later we get the report from a Licensed Termite inspector and ALL clear. NOT a Termite no where. if they are not licensed for something they should not suggest it. There was a radio in the garage, they decided to install an antenna for better reception and the inspection said oh it's an exposed electrical wire.  No it's not it's a dam antenna. They should have really payed more attention to the trainee. So many negative issues with these Inspectors. On top of that after the inspection they sat at the table for over 2 hours talking about issues that have nothing to do with a home inspection.  Talking about how it's his birthday and he was going to Vegas for a few days.  That has nothing to do with a home inspection.  Horrible!!! Total of 3 1/2 hours.They may have a bunch of gadgets but they need to get up there and look for things themselves and not depend on cameras. Seriously looked like they where selling themselves to get hired and not looking out for the buyer. Scared both home owners and buyers. Decided to redo the inspection with another company and wow we where relieved way better service and way way less issues.</text>

{'time': 1519496143749, 'text': "Sorry you felt uncomfortable with the inspection. We do inspect the roof. We use a 53ft camera pole for the best views of the roof.  We use to insure that we don't damage roofs. All photos of the roof were included in the report. I'm sure if you read the report, you would know that we didn't call out any pest damage. It is our duty to call out rotten/damage wood and painting maintenance. We do check all appliances to ensure that they work. We do sit down with buyers to answer all of their concerns after the inspection. I do review every inspection that my certified inspector performs. That can take some time on occasions. I'm not sure what inspection that you are taking about, since you are not listed as the buyer or seller on any inspection in our system. We do have a 100% money back guarantee on all inspections.\n\nYou know I never received an complaint regarding this inspection. Please feel free to contact me."}< /Resp>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I recommend this company are very reliable professionals friendly staff explain clearly the damage k enconresponde.Y respond to all questions k do them.
And no doubt when I need another inspection again I will call them and I am recommending them to my family and friends if they are buying a house or if they need an inspection, there is no better company.

(Original)

Not many defects noted. Now I received a call from your Realtor regarding the windows we could test due to personal goods and a sub-panel that was painted shut. Most people dont understand that the SOP of a home inspection. Now, we set up a re-inspection, at zero cost to you, normally cost $200. It was communicated to us that we would have access to the windows and that the access had been created to sub-panel. Now, no furniture was moved, but windows were open when we arrived. No access was created for the sub-panel.\n\nNow we hope you enjoy your condo. It is a great area of town. We ask that you give a more appropriate rating.'}<//Resp>< gmapID>

Lovely local yarn store. They have a variety of locally crafted yarns as well as major brands ranging from lace weight to chunky. The staff is knowledgeable about their stock and always willing to wind balls of yarn when you buy them. Currently the occupancy is low, so if you come at a busy time you may have to wait outside for a few minutes. Aside from yarn, needles, and hooks, they have other supplies like tape measures, stitch markers, and charms.<//text>

<Review>The people who work there are very friendly, kind, knowledgeable, and helpful. They can give you advice and recommendations on just about anything knitting or anything else yarn related there. They have a wonderful selection of yarn and other related tools. They sell quality products. I love the bamboo knitting needles they carry, they feel and look so nice. I wish I could buy all of their multi colored yarn.

Yes, you could buy all the products they carry online, but you would not get the wonderful environment, experience, and help they can offer you. I love going there and will continue to do so.

They are also follow covid protocol, wearing masks and only allowing two customers in at a time as it is a small space. The shop is very clean as well.< /Review>< pics>

This shop is very good for how tiny it is. Because it is so tiny, their curation of stock is thoughtful, so if your tastes run aling the same lines as theirs, it's lovey. Though tiny, it does have seating for class or waiting for a friend to finish shopping. They have wonderful notions, including kitty stitch markers. :-)<//Text>

So grateful to have this beautiful store in Santa Cruz!  The owner,  Corey,  has staffed the store with knowledgeable and competent knitters who are always willing to help you with your projects.  They have created a wonderful community and space to knit and learn more about this wonderful art.

AND the yarns she stocks are beautiful to the touch with ample samples.  Perfect spot for the novice as well as the expert!</review>

HORRIBLE customer service, very rude over the phone. Some people do not understand,  you can have an awesome product and ok prices, the key is how you handle the customers. Take care of your customers or someone else will. Sometimes it's worth paying extra for an awesome customer experience< /review>

Purchased a long block engine. Came with damaged chain case cover, they sent me a new one but it wasn’t the correct one. After engine was installed we learned it had a bad lifter. They would only offer small refund and the $10 replacement part. Since my new motor with only 9 miles on it was now out of its 90 day warranty. Now my new 9 mile motet is at the shop getting the rear main seal replaced, which I’m sure I will also be completely responsible for. We will see how well it runs when it has 10 miles on it! Wish me luck! Customer service was ok, product was absolute nightmare.<//Text>

I had the opportunity to speak with Alex on the phone over the price of a hardtop for my Jeep. From the second I arrived he was professional and direct. I had the opportunity to meet Ban and Edgar who where also very professional. Being a female looking for car parts is scary but they made me feel safe and there were all men of their word. I definitely recommend this place and I will be a returning customer.< /Text>

Called ahead to see if they had a jeep hood, which they said they did. Drove up all the way from San Diego and was not disappointed! Friendly, to the point, and helpful family owned business. Highly recommend if you need parts for your jeep at at a good price.<//review>

Sold me a rebuilt engine for $2000. Engine wasn't built properly, the engine doesn't even have 7k miles on it and the unbalanced crank tore it apart. It also has the worst blowby I’ve ever seen. They also admitted to selling me a bad engine and offered to sell me a used crank, which would mean I would have to take out the engine again and then rebuild the entire thing. They told me they couldn't do anything about it. These guys cost me $10k-8k due to their negligence. I’m so disappointed in this shady company that should be closed down 😔</text>

Found a few upgrades though and the workers were honest hard working guys. Other customers seemed happy and friendly. I'd come back if anything ever broke on my 02 Jeep TJ as they had an extensive amount of stock parts like axles, engines, and transmissions.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>I had a great experience here.  I believe I spoke with the owner and his son.  They let me check the place out and got me a few little parts for a reasonable price. I was surprised as the selection they had for older to brand new jeeps.  I will definitely be a returning customer.</Review><Time>1486098905373<//Time><Resp>None</Resp>< rate>

<Review>I recently purchased a rebuilt engine for a 2003 Jeep Liberty.  The price was excellent and the service was great.  They were asked to remove a screw my mechanic had broken in the engine.  Although it was not their fault, they removed the screw and re threaded the hole at no cost to me.  Great job!< /Review>< Time>

This place is amazing...

I had a passenger side headlight out on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler JK.
They had stock headlights in stock, brand new... They also i stalled them and didnt charge alot for it.

It was fast, it was affordable, the customer service was great, straight and to the point.

I'm also getting a passenger side window for my door, as my Jeep was broken into New Year's Eve night... They have one, its used and it's affordable!!

These guys are so awesome. I can't say it enough.

<Text>I purchased a remanufactured 4.7 for my 99 grand cherokee, the engine runs beautifully. I have over a thousand miles on it and it sounds great.oil pressure is perfect. Customer service is second to none. Super stoked on my choice to drive there for a good deal.

< Review>
Poor quality, poor support.  Purchased a remanufactured engine for Jeep Grand Cherokee but had low oil pressure once installed.  Checked oil pressure sensor, pick up tube, filter etc.  all fine.  Called Jeep parts depot within the 90 day warranty period they said the owner was out of the country (?) so they could only sell the engines but suggested I use heavier weight oil since that cleared up a similar problem in his wife's Jeep.  When that didn't work (surprise) they blamed a faulty oil pressure sensor even though that had been tried three different times.  When finally was able to get an actual pressure reading it was truly too low.  Called Jeeppartsdepot back and they said it now outside the 90 day window so they didn't have any obligation for the defective engine.  Now, 18-months later, the head components are degrading due to insufficient oil circulation.  Three independent mechanics have looked at it and concluded the crankshaft main bearings were installed incorrectly.  The time and money I have spent to figure this out has easily outweighed my initial 'savings'.  The engine they sold me indicates either they do not know what they are doing or they don't care.  Buyer beware!<//Review>

Went in on a Saturday at 1:30 right before they closed. I was there over an hour and not rushed since they close at 2 which was great. I bought some parts for my 2006 jeep Wrangler which cost 50% less than what i would have paid for at the dealer. The guys (i Beleive it was the owner) took their time to show me how to install the Seats i bought from them and they were cool enough to install a few small interior parts i had bought for no additional cost. Will always return, thanks guys!< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Very bad attention. Prices a little high to never have the parts that are needed.

Cho from Joy Laundry has been incredibly friendly and helpful with their pick-up and drop-off services, and everything I give them to clean including bedding, clothes, and uniform items always come back the cleanest they’ve ever been, every time. I have never been disappointed by their service!<//text>

This is a great laundromat in a bad location. If they were in Yuba City they would be the most popular laundromat in town. They have good washers and dryersand great service from the family that owns it. I would definitely recommend this place if your close to it.</Text>

Best place in yuba county to do your laundry. Good machines to use and great service  available for laundry services drop your laundry off and let them clean this service is pay by pound. Still nice to know they have that type of service. Brent Stephens<//text>

< Review>
Definitely the BEST laundromat in the marysville/ yuba city area. Its honestly the best laundromat I've ever visited. I've been super skeptical about trying a public laundromat, as I've always had my own personal washer and dryer. However, Joys Laundry gave me more than enough reassurance. Their facility is CLEAN! The owner is attentive to the environment and does his best to keep the place clean, safe and orderly. The washers are SO CLEAN! Prices are fair and dryers work well. Their washers are even touch screen and they have an atm, change machine, popping music playing, snacks, soaps vending, some kids entertainment and even TV's. This laundromat is awesome. I'll never look for another again. Thanks Joy's!! You guys rocked it with this laundromat. Keep it up, it's awesome :)<//Review>

Good machines, well kept facility; unfortunately many of the customers did have masks on which detracted from the experience.<//Text>

Good place to wash/dry your clothes. CLEAN. Onsite owner is friendly and helpful. Change machine, atm, snacks/drinks machines, televisions, large fans for hot days.<//Text>

Clean, enough space for 6 ft distancing, and new machines with WiFi made the trip to and from the laundromat nice. For those whom don't have a car since it on the way to yuba college it has three bus line which makes god send in these communities where a car is deem a necessity.</review>

Love this place ! The little old couple are so sweet and kind. I brought the old lady coffee and she was so grateful. The laundry mat is always very neat and clean. They all are the best in town by far especially for location.<//Review>

<Review>My washer broke on me and was dreading going to a coin pop laundry mat. I got here and wow. The place was super clean and very comfortable. They got places to sit down, music, tv, fans and great prices. Plus, there is someone here on staff. Great job.<//Review></record>

Everyone is always super friendly and nice except the old lady. She hates children and always watches people like they are going to steal things. She always yells at the nice husband because he is so helpful. She and she also makes the place bad. They should keep her away from the business. She is always rude to people.<//Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>Had to do some oversized bedding but wasnt sure where to go. I was pressed for time and looking for something close. So, we rolled the dice on this one, and thankfully it turned out to be a very nice place. The owner or manager was very pleasant and helpful. Prices for single serving detergents and fabric softeners were not bad at all.  Clean environment and descent selection of machines available to use. They also offer laundering services for what I thought was a pretty good price.< /text>< Pictures>

Looks just like the pictures posted in the other reviews. I liked that it was clean, had an ATM inside as well as a change machine. The ATM machine said it took an EBT card; I thought that was for food stamps only, but if you can use the funds for laundry too that's awesome. My only complaint is that there aren't enough folding tables on the East side of the room.</review>

Owners are amazingly friendly and the place is always tidy. They have a rewards card for repeat customers and and make sure to take care of the customer. I have several laundromats near me in Yuba City but always drive right on by to go here. Amazing place!!!!<//review>

Says all over on every machine they accept credit cards, but owners refuse, only point to the ATM; clearly they don’t know the difference between credit and debit cards. False advertising.< /review>

Very clean (the most important thing!), there is always staff on site and they are friendly as well. You also get a stamp card, and on Wednesdays and Thursdays you get $1 off every 3, 4, 6 and 8-load washers you use.< /Review>

Reasonable price, quality of meats with basic side dishes. Marinated meats were really good and  probably the best price AYCE Korean BBQ in the area.</text>

I was pretty disappointed! While the price was wallet friendly, the food and service disappointed me big time! First the meat - normal selections you would expect at an ayce kbbq so nothing special here to talk about. The extras were lacking - like there was NO lettuce!  The self serve bar was tiny and the fruits were from a can and had no fruit taste!  Second the service - the limited staff was definitely short on people so we had to wait long for the meat to come out. I sympathize with them but blame the management for it.  Over all, didn't really enjoy the experience and would NOT come back.  This is a shame since this branch is closer to me than driving out to Korea town.  Oh well, gotta go where the good food is!< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQNxgb7jifMvKrWbu2hwtfknINc2TsqqC8uiN0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
This is the place when people want to spend minimum money for AYCE Korean BBQ in local area. It only costs $19.99 per person to get a different kind of meat and seafood. I love to eat beef belly, rib fingers, and pork belly because they have good quality.  Also, it has mini salad bar which I love to grab tofu, fish cakes as much as I want. The service here is great, and food always cone out fast as well.  Also, beer is not expensive here for a mud size so next time I may order one as well.

It is very good place for 2 or more people to come here for BBQ because it has good environment, good quality of meat, and services.<//Review>

You can ask for green salad and tofu soup if they didn't set e it to you, it totally comes with the meal for free!  I highly recommend this place if you like Korean BBQ.<//Review>

Awesome place for meat lovers. A little step away from traditional restaurants so if you are looking for something new and delicious, this place is perfect. Tons of different meat choices and a very attentive staff. The prices compared to other Korean BBQ's is pretty good too. I try to come here whenever I get a chance.< /Review>

Friendly service and the waiter made himself available. The salad bar was laid out and presented well, but some of the items didn't taste very fresh. Most of the meat was very good though.< /Text>

Surprisingly one of the best KBBQ's I have had. The meat was great, solid selection, and the customer service was on point, to where they have a bell installed at each table to notify them you need assistance, but not once did we have to use it since they would come around and check up on you so often!</review>

Went there as part of an Christmas Office party, where our group was distributed to several tables.  The place is clean, well-designed and brightly lit, upstairs in a somewhat shabby multi-use complex.  Tables typically seat 4 around a stainless grill at the center of the table, where you cook your own meat selections.

You order meats from a long menu -- including marinated beef, pork and chicken as well as unmarinated selections like steak, bacon ("pork bellies") and shrimp.  The staff will deliver up to three meat choices at a time to the table and you share.  Standard tableware are chopsticks and a single steel tong to be used in common to turn the meat.  There's a self-serve salad bar where you can also get some grillable accompaniments.

The grill surface is stainless steel and the staff will lift it off and replace it with a clean unit after your first round of meats.  There's a button on the table to summon a server when you are ready to order a second round of meats.  Theoretically, it is all you can eat, but two rounds was all we could manage.

This was my first experience with Korean BBQ and I think the newbie would want someone more experienced along for a first ride.  How satisfied you are is likely to vary with how successful you are in selecting meats and managing the cooking process and the traditional Korean condiments.  As simple as it is -- and there's nothing complicated about laying meat on the grill and turning it over when it appears to be done -- you will want some reassuring instruction from your companions.  The staff may be used to instructing newcomers -- I don't know because we had some experienced diners among us.  Service, as far as bringing meat and clearing the table, was efficient but not particular friendly or interactive -- that might not be case if you were not part of a large office party as i was.

The apparent quality of meat was very high.  I found the marinated beef especially tasty.  I am not sure I like sharing my table with a very hot grill, but that's necessary to the experience i suppose.  Other people i know said Honey Pig is as good as it gets in the Korean BBQ category.

Pricing seemed fair.  Standard gratuities are added to the bill.</review>

this would of been 4-5 star, but i can't eat here alone. let me re-phrase that, they don't allow a single person to eat for table of 1. i just wanted good lunch. you are required to come in with 2 or more people. i like the food and the meat selection and that fact that there is a KBBQ so close to home. why HONEY PIG!?! why can't i just grub on my own?!! WHY DO THIS TO ME? i'm hungry and too lazy to go to New Gen or RTS.<//Text>

It is afraid that we won’t pay the tips or something ? Cause we go there often and we pay TIPS EVERY SINGLE TIME.We went to ask the waitress at the front door she said i point out Costumer tips every time. Which is so suck !

The quality of the service was great but believe me man, this is not the place to come for Korean barbeque. The quality of the salad and select meats were great, but there fish cakes or crab cakes that were presented on the salad bar gave me food poisioning. If you really want an authentic Korean barbeque meal go to JBBQ on Vermont Ave in LA. That my friends is higher quality meat and same great service.</Text>

<Text>The atmosphere in the restaurant is perfect. Nice music and clean table wares. Service is average. BUT the star of any restaurant has to be the food which, at Honey Pig 2.0, is what I find very lacking in taste and quality. While the price tag seems pretty good for an average Korean barbecue restaurant, the quality is just not there.
First, let's start with the sides because that is what you will have to walk up and get it yourself in a buffet style which is fine. There are typical Korean sides such as kimchi, rice, mash potatoes, etc. what strikes me the most is the fried chicken which is stone cold. Kimchi tastes like it is bought from a store that comes in a plastic jar container.
Moving on to the meat which is very lacking in consistency. Brisket sometimes come with extreme amount of fat and no fat at all. Beef short ribs are very tough like rubber. Beef galbi came in a very strange condition. The beef itself is charred and seems like it has been partially cooked once before it was served.
Overall, the restaurant fails to highlight the most important thing, the food.<//Text>< Name>

<Text>Went during lunch time on Friday. The service was prompt and attentive. Refills were prompt, food came out quickly, the dishes were nice and clean, the side dish bar was nice and well stocked.

Best part? The pork belly, the marinated pork belly was delicious and full of flavor, the kalbi was boneless and prebbq'd lightly so it wouldn't take forever to cook on the hot plate.

Also, unlike most KBBQ places, this place actually turns on the hood, so that the place isn't smoky and you don't end up smelling like KBBQ when you're done. This is how it's supposed to be done, the other KBBQ places could most definitely learn a thing or two from this place!</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c55d6819a0f7:0xb4cb7b906de408<//Gmap_id>< Date>

Don't let the price fool you. It's cheap. The taste just isn't there. Spend some more money find another one.<//review>

I visit this outstanding place from time to time since I love the good air that is unique to this place. The crew is extraordianrillyremarkably cordial and experienced. The service is impressively efficient. Not to mention, the food they prepare is highly distinguished. I frequent often and I was always delighted. The cost is reasobable. I suggest this restaurant to to all.</Review>

<Review>When the family and I walked we were skeptical. The place was empty (not what you would expect) and it looked like a fancy restaurant in an Italian mobster movie.

The table side Cesar salad was unique andt he best Cesar salad any of us has ever had. We ordered 5 different plates and all were wonderful.

Desert was homemade and delicious.

While we were seating at our table he inquired about how we heard of his restaurant ..

We started our meal with their delicious bread basket along with olive oil and balsamic. As for our entree, we got the Halibut special as well as Spaghetti with meat sauce... I have to say the fish was moist and cooked perfectly. As for my pasta, it was a bit on the salty side and I would have liked it if it had some marinara sauce on the side or something.

We could not end our meal w/o trying one of their delicious desserts. So we got the berry tart for to go.
The tart was very delicious and it wasn't too sweet. The berries were fresh and just perfect.

So why did I deduct a star? Well our server was a bit fake... I didn't like that.<//Review>< time>

Best place in Glendale. They were closed for a private party, and the owner invited us in for an amazing dinner. And didn't even want to charge us for it. Definitely recommend. And the food and service is amazing<//Review>

Went here twice this week, as I was at a conference nearby. Very quiet and upscale place for the price. Food was tasty. Service was rough though --- both times I asked for a dish with chicken, and both times they forgot the chicken.<//Review>

<review>We had the most fabulous Christmas Eve dinner for our family of eleven. It was elegant, gracious dining with fresh, delicious food.  We loved it so much that we're going again tonight!
We've been searching for this kind of a restaurant for a couple years and now we found it so close to home! We had read old reviews so wondered, but the new owner has it together! Everything from the service to the freshly baked bread to the fresh fish, pasta and dessert was excellent.  And it's so cozy and elegant inside - how wonderful not to have to yell across a table to be heard as is the case in so many "new cuisine" restaurants.  Here the linen clothed tables, carpeting and elegant decor make for a romantic and intimate setting complete with classical piano played by a real person not a player piano!  yay!!  I add this because I've noticed that many newer restaurants no longer have real people playing the piano, instead they have some kind of player piano that just plays by itself.
So, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.<//review></record>

The food is a bit basic and quite pricey for what it is. From the outside it didn't look inviting,  while the inside is very chique. The waiter didn't know the menu or speak Italian. The place had a really weird vibe.< /text>

Introduced some Korean and Korean-American folks to this place, and they all think it's the best Italian place they've ever been to and one of the best (if not the best) restaurant they've been to in the Glendale.  In fact, I've been here 3 times in the past week due to out of town co-workers hearing about the raves, and I'm not tired of it (and I get tired of restaurants quickly).

That said, this really is a great place.  Nice converted house atmosphere with a live piano music.  Fresh ingredients--I often get the daily special (usually one pasta and one meat/fish item).  Be sure to add a little cheese and pepper to the minestrone soup (Italian vegetable), and it's delicious.  Also, best tiramisu ever, although I like some of the other desserts, too. This place is never full - 5 stars..<//text>

<text>Very disappointed,  I was staying in town on business and placed an order online for delivery to my hotel.  I received the confirmation email and an estimated time of 45 - 60 minutes and my credit card was charged.  By 9:20 it was just after an hour of waiting I called.  I was told that no order had been received. I probably would not have written this review had a solution been offered.  At no point did this person offer to start my order and have it sent over (mind you it was 9:20 and they close at 10 and the Hilton was about a 5 minute walk away from their location, I would've walked and picked it up at that point, I was starving!) nor was I offered some sort of sorry please join us for dinner tomorrow insert percentage off bill or something else.  It gets one star because the food truly sounded delicious from the descriptions and another because he at least said he would call the company and have my money refunded.  I called the company (clouder?), as well, afterwards and they also apologized and said they would refund it.  I understand mistakes happen, even if it was clouder's fault, but there is no reason that the only thing offered was a "sorry" Very disappointing, I purposely chose this placed based on the reviews I found and was looking forward to trying the food< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c04c7deec9f5:0x7b1eb3da309d942c</Gmap_id><pics>None< /pics>< Time>

<Review>Nothing special here. Tequila chicken fettuccine was ok but chicken was over grilled. Atmosphere is dreary. No piano music but it was Wednesday evening. I was the only customer in the restaurant besides some financial group meeting of retirees who were not eating - just discussing options on savings strategies.  My waiter had challenges  with a command of english and correctly pronouncing menu options so I could not understand him.  To top the experience off, the restuarant leaves the front door open so I was constantly swatting at bugs hovering around my wine glass.<//Review>< Time>

ideally suited for the 'over 70' crowd, this neighborhood italian does offer fine dining but appears lost in a time capsule, relying on its glory days while stubbornly refusing to infuse this tired menu with new items, or to even consider a make over to decor better left to the 1970s.</text>

<review>The place is a really good date spot. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. My friend and I came here without a reservation because we were craving Italian and this was the best rated place in the area.

We ordered the Tonnarelli alla Capricciosa and Fettucine alla Ghiotta. Both were amazing. For wine, we got the Chianti and Zinfandel -- don't remember which Zinfandel, but it was a bit spicy.

Overall, a great experience. It's quiet enough to actually carry on a conversation and the tables weren't so close to each other that you felt like you were intruding on your neighbors' meals< /review>< pictures>

“Nice food”
We went to celebrate my newphews birthday, very good food and we had a great time Place was very nice and the place was run very organized but in the end they rushed us out, because there was a big party waiting to be seated.< /Text>

<text>City Boxing offers ample amount of equipment and space to satisfy your fitness needs. The facility is well maintained and clean.

The classes are taught by certified trainers with prior experience in their respective art of fighting. The trainers are professional, attentive, and will promptly correct you if you make a mistake  in order to instill good habits.

My experience at the gym has been nothing but positive vibes. I highly recommend this business and will re-enroll again upon expiration of contract.< /text></record></dataset><record>

This gym is great and has everything you could ever ask for... except parking

The community in the gym feels like a family, go there enough and you will learn peoples names and be greeted, this atmosphere makes it less daunting for newbies to come in. Usually there is a dedicated class specifically for new people trying to grasp the basics.

I cannot recommend this gym more! going to work out doesn't feel like a chore it feels like a social outing and is a blast!

My only problem is parking is hard to find.<//text>

Perfect place to learn how to box. The trainers are very experienced and hands on. The take the time to work with you individually as well as in groups. It is a hard class but if you’re looking for a challenge.. look no further. The atmosphere is great and the attitudes of the staff is nothing short of energetic and positive. This is my new daily workout regime.< /text>

I was in town for work for about a week and reached out to City Boxing for a couple private lessons so I didn’t just skip a week of training.

Austin was my coach, and I can’t give him enough praise.  Super-nice guy and knows his boxing.  Very patient and fun to work with as well.  He worked my tail off and I learned a lot.  Highly recommend City Boxing and Austin as a personal boxing coach.  Super clean gym and everyone was friendly and welcoming, even towards this country boy from Louisiana :-)< /Review>

Best atmosphere for training, development and the building of confidence. I endorse this gym to the young and old. The trainers are excellent; the equipment is efficient for conditioning and the location is great for those who live in the Downtown area of San Diego. The classes meet the level of the student and the trainers push the student to reach their potential. The price is reasonable and affordable. This is a gym for the real fighter.<//Text>

Baruch, Manny, and Denis are world class trainers- you cannot beat the prices compared to other gyms in town.

The staff at city boxing are all really nice and welcoming and the gym environment itself offers really good. Everyone is really supportive and non judgmental, everyone there just wants to be healthy and push themselves and they will encourage you to do your best everyday. I highly recommend this gym to anyone looking to get in shape or to challenge themselves if they're already in shape.</text>

I have been a member at City Boxing for 2 years now.  Over these two years I have achieved all of my fitness goals I had set for myself, and continue to surpass my own expectations.  The gym has many knowledgeable trainers and members, and with a little hard work you too can achieve whatever goal you set your mind to.</Review>

<text>I came to City Boxing looking for a gym that can not only provide a great workout, but also teach true boxing techniques, and they’ve exceeded my expectations. Both coach manny and coach Vernon are passionate about teaching their students and encouraging them through tough workouts. I highly recommend this place to anyone that may want to learn boxing (or Muay Thai or BJJ), but may be intimated. The area is very welcoming and motivating.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>One of the things I like about this gym is that there is a very low douche factor. The people that come to the gym want to learn boxing and help others learn and not just to fight. There is fighting but in a beginner class there should be more conditioning and technique which they are seeming to do more with the beginner class and separating the not so beginners into another class. There are plenty of people that will give you tips and are very helpful when you ask questions. Also, the workouts are intense hour and half workouts for boxing, whenever I finish I have my shirt completely soaking. I know some people gripe about contracts which do suck I was very hesitant but it makes you go even more so you don't feel like you are wasting money.<//Review><userid>116057135206200982957<//userid>< pics>

Practiced boxing for the first time ever. and was told to work with a trainer on the basics while the beginners class worked with another teacher. The guy did nothing but complain about how bad I was and told me I was stupid and had no sense. And that I didnt know how to control my own body, I was like jeez this is the first time. I only run and do yoga never boxed. The guy wasn't making sense, had no clue what he wanted me to do. Then at the end was saying I could be a champion if I come in everyday like come on bro. spent 2 hours with him and learned nothing. Never went back because I knew I would have to train with him a few more times to start the beginners class. But maybe the other classes are good.</text>

I've been a member for about four months now i am having a blast; i cant get enough of it, im all about it. i saw my body transform in only a month and a half, i love it. the trainers are some of the coolest people i know. when i started i had no idea what i would be getting my self into but they took there time and trained me well. One of the most important thing i know from these guys is that they will never let me give up,  they will continue to help me dig deep and give them my absolute best everytime.</Text>

< review>
This gym is solid. I only attend the Boxing classes with Vernon and Manny. Basically, Vernon focuses on technique and combos while Manny is straight conditioning and repetition. The best part of this gym is you get to know a lot of people, and I have to admit, they're a good crowd. But don't get me wrong, this is not a social gym. You will work out hard and sweat no matter what shape you're in. It's the kind of workout you can only get when working with others, because right at that moment when you are about to give up, you look around and see everyone else sweating and pushing hard, it just makes you find an inner strength that keeps you going. You will leave feeling accomplished and overall I'd say it's a great alternative to other gyms since you have access to free weight and cardio equipment, as well.</review>

<text>Well I've never been to another MMA gym before but City Boxing to me is a good gym. The classes are a workout plus they teach you how to defend yourself. Also the hours of the classes works with my schedule and day job. I like it so far.</text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I've been training Muy Thai for about a year and i took a one on one lesson from Denis while on a business trip.  The training was excellent.  He is definitely an artist when i comes to Muy Thai.  I highly recommend a lesson from Denis Grachev if you get the opportunity.  Check out his wiki page if you've never heard of him.  Thanks Again Denis!!</text>< response>

I love this gym. Ever since Ive joined the staff has been nothing short of excellent to me. Im learning more than martial arts here also, Denis has taught me some words in Russian as well. This Gym is phenomenal to say the least. I couldnt be happier about being a part of the city boxing fam.< /text>

City boxing is the best place I ever joined.  This is a real boxing gym all the trainers are frinedly and instructive.They genuinely want to make you do better..  When I frist started traning at city boxing I did not think I was going to make it but with the constant motivation of the trainers I have accomplished more than I ever thought possible. I am stronger  in better physical shape learned a lot of skills and ready for the next level.<//review>

<review>I've wanted to learn boxing/Kickboxing and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for some time now. I did the whole search the web, travel to the place, talk to the people that work there and what not. My first try was Arena on Sports Arena Blvd and the guy gave me what they offered and a 30 day breakable contract. Then I told him I'm in the military and he started going off on all the Spec War guys he trains and how they asked him to rewrite their hand to hand combat book. I'm cool with that, good on you, but don't use it as a selling pitch. It just turns me off

Then I went to City Boxing and talked with them. Very kind, very professional staff. I was walked around the facility, met the trainers, shown a schedule that works with my hectic schedule and it was done. Went for training the next day and learned a ton of new things in the 3+ hours I was there. All the trainers are really helpful and will help you every step of the way; fixing form, helping you understand the movements and when they can be used. Vernon is a great boxing trainer, always willing to help you understand how to do the foot work and the strikes. Baruch is a great BJJ instructor. I have learned so much about Jiu Jitzu in my 2 days there and caught on quick.

It's a great atmosphere, professional/friendly staff, and they at least remember your name. Great place for anyone wanting to learn Jiu Mics, boxing, and Kickboxing. Really affordable prices. Paid a lump sum of 650 bucks for a year. $54 a month, that's an unbeatable price!< /review>< Pics>

<Text>City Boxing offers ample amount of equipment and space to satisfy your fitness needs. The facility is well maintained and clean.

The classes are taught by certified trainers with prior experience in their respective art of fighting. The trainers are professional, attentive, and will promptly correct you if you make a mistake  in order to instill good habits.

My experience at the gym has been nothing but positive vibes. I highly recommend this business and will re-enroll again upon expiration of contract.< /Text><GmapID>0x80d9535f8eaa1fb3:0x838d7f4d5b0a541a< /GmapID>< user>

<text>This gym is great and has everything you could ever ask for... except parking

The community in the gym feels like a family, go there enough and you will learn peoples names and be greeted, this atmosphere makes it less daunting for newbies to come in. Usually there is a dedicated class specifically for new people trying to grasp the basics.

I cannot recommend this gym more! going to work out doesn't feel like a chore it feels like a social outing and is a blast!

My only problem is parking is hard to find.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Perfect place to learn how to box. The trainers are very experienced and hands on. The take the time to work with you individually as well as in groups. It is a hard class but if you’re looking for a challenge.. look no further. The atmosphere is great and the attitudes of the staff is nothing short of energetic and positive. This is my new daily workout regime.< /Text>< pictures>

Austin was my coach, and I can’t give him enough praise.  Super-nice guy and knows his boxing.  Very patient and fun to work with as well.  He worked my tail off and I learned a lot.  Highly recommend City Boxing and Austin as a personal boxing coach.  Super clean gym and everyone was friendly and welcoming, even towards this country boy from Louisiana :-)</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1559048801864, 'text': 'Thank you!'}</resp><gmap_id>0x80d9535f8eaa1fb3:0x838d7f4d5b0a541a< /gmap_id></record>

Best atmosphere for training, development and the building of confidence. I endorse this gym to the young and old. The trainers are excellent; the equipment is efficient for conditioning and the location is great for those who live in the Downtown area of San Diego. The classes meet the level of the student and the trainers push the student to reach their potential. The price is reasonable and affordable. This is a gym for the real fighter.</Review>

Been training here almost a year now - All the trainers here have real fight experience. The atmosphere is welcoming for all ages- if you want to learn Boxing, Muay Thai, Jiu Jitsu, or even MMA, City Boxing is the place to be. There’s a full size boxing ring, cage, and weight room. Baruch, Manny, and Denis are world class trainers- you cannot beat the prices compared to other gyms in town. Most people don’t know the rich history of this place - it’s one of the original mma gyms here in San Diego EST. 2001. If you want to learn how to fight- and gain confidence/heart. Come to City Boxing.<//review>

I have been a member at City Boxing for 2 years now.  Over these two years I have achieved all of my fitness goals I had set for myself, and continue to surpass my own expectations.  The gym has many knowledgeable trainers and members, and with a little hard work you too can achieve whatever goal you set your mind to.< /text>

I came to City Boxing looking for a gym that can not only provide a great workout, but also teach true boxing techniques, and they’ve exceeded my expectations. Both coach manny and coach Vernon are passionate about teaching their students and encouraging them through tough workouts. I highly recommend this place to anyone that may want to learn boxing (or Muay Thai or BJJ), but may be intimated. The area is very welcoming and motivating.<//review>

One of the things I like about this gym is that there is a very low douche factor. The people that come to the gym want to learn boxing and help others learn and not just to fight. There is fighting but in a beginner class there should be more conditioning and technique which they are seeming to do more with the beginner class and separating the not so beginners into another class. There are plenty of people that will give you tips and are very helpful when you ask questions. Also, the workouts are intense hour and half workouts for boxing, whenever I finish I have my shirt completely soaking. I know some people gripe about contracts which do suck I was very hesitant but it makes you go even more so you don't feel like you are wasting money.</text>

Practiced boxing for the first time ever. and was told to work with a trainer on the basics while the beginners class worked with another teacher. The guy did nothing but complain about how bad I was and told me I was stupid and had no sense. And that I didnt know how to control my own body, I was like jeez this is the first time. I only run and do yoga never boxed. The guy wasn't making sense, had no clue what he wanted me to do. Then at the end was saying I could be a champion if I come in everyday like come on bro. spent 2 hours with him and learned nothing. Never went back because I knew I would have to train with him a few more times to start the beginners class. But maybe the other classes are good.<//Review>

This gym is solid. I only attend the Boxing classes with Vernon and Manny. Basically, Vernon focuses on technique and combos while Manny is straight conditioning and repetition. The best part of this gym is you get to know a lot of people, and I have to admit, they're a good crowd. But don't get me wrong, this is not a social gym. You will work out hard and sweat no matter what shape you're in. It's the kind of workout you can only get when working with others, because right at that moment when you are about to give up, you look around and see everyone else sweating and pushing hard, it just makes you find an inner strength that keeps you going. You will leave feeling accomplished and overall I'd say it's a great alternative to other gyms since you have access to free weight and cardio equipment, as well.< /review>

<review>I've been training Muy Thai for about a year and i took a one on one lesson from Denis while on a business trip.  The training was excellent.  He is definitely an artist when i comes to Muy Thai.  I highly recommend a lesson from Denis Grachev if you get the opportunity.  Check out his wiki page if you've never heard of him.  Thanks Again Denis!!<//review></record>

<Review>Went here gor a jiu jitsu class. Was a great class on a lot of basics, and the instructor did a great job in correcting some minor errors in my techniques. Really nice facility with tons of mat space, boxing ring, and tons of exercise equipment.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1559060451116, 'text': 'Thank you for your business'}< /response><gmapID>0x80d9535f8eaa1fb3:0x838d7f4d5b0a541a</gmapID></record>

I've wanted to learn boxing/Kickboxing and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for some time now. I did the whole search the web, travel to the place, talk to the people that work there and what not. My first try was Arena on Sports Arena Blvd and the guy gave me what they offered and a 30 day breakable contract. Then I told him I'm in the military and he started going off on all the Spec War guys he trains and how they asked him to rewrite their hand to hand combat book. I'm cool with that, good on you, but don't use it as a selling pitch. It just turns me off

Then I went to City Boxing and talked with them. Very kind, very professional staff. I was walked around the facility, met the trainers, shown a schedule that works with my hectic schedule and it was done. Went for training the next day and learned a ton of new things in the 3+ hours I was there. All the trainers are really helpful and will help you every step of the way; fixing form, helping you understand the movements and when they can be used. Vernon is a great boxing trainer, always willing to help you understand how to do the foot work and the strikes. Baruch is a great BJJ instructor. I have learned so much about Jiu Jitzu in my 2 days there and caught on quick.

It's a great atmosphere, professional/friendly staff, and they at least remember your name. Great place for anyone wanting to learn Jiu Mics, boxing, and Kickboxing. Really affordable prices. Paid a lump sum of 650 bucks for a year. $54 a month, that's an unbeatable price!< /Review>

This is not your regular burger.  My dining companions and I found ourselves in near heaven while eating our meal. It would be better to describe it as an experience for the taste buds.  The staff is very friendly. The food is delicious. There are many TV screens so you can watch any sport that's playing. A very enjoyable time!</Text>

I hosted my gender reveal here in the patio with about 30 people and it was great. I messaged back and forth with Muoi and always received a fast and complete response. Ryan served my guests with 2 or 3 other servers and they were on it! Delivered everything timely, refilled drinks often, picked up often. My guests were all very comfortable and we had a lot of fun. All the food was delicious and we can't wait to go back just to enjoy good food, great service, oh and really good drinks from the non-preggo guests. I only saw 1 restroom that was near us in the patio but it was never an issue. It was clean and stocked always.</review>

Very nice experience. First timer, so it's better when it goes smoothly....
The gentleman who recommended the beer with my hot hot 🔥 hamburger the one with ghost 👻 pepper 🌶 rub.... which was to die for... back to the gentleman... he was very friendly and very competent in his choosing... he made my evening with my boyfriend just better... everybody was very nice there... distances were respected and everyone was wearing a mask when necessary... great place. Can't wait to try some other delightful burger from there.... Thank you<//Review>

It's been 5 years from the last time I visited a Slater's 50/50, and I was so thrilled to know I have this one close to my new place. Family and I dined in after church, and it was the perfect time to go, like noonish. Service was great, food was served in a timely manner, and it was DELICIOUS. I highly recommend the mac n cheese panko balls. My toddler was a huge fan of them, and so were we. This is the place you want to come to, if you're wanting something savory. They know how to make good food. 👏🏼< /review>

I ordered my food online. Didn't eat inside.
The burgers are big,and yummy. There are kids meals for kids,mixed drinks for adults.
I had the Slater 50/50,it was good.
There are so many options, you can get Hawaiin style,a sriracha burger,a fried egg on your burger,build your own burger.
Next time I want desserts,their desserts look amazing.</Review>

<user_id>103466471390529588336< /user_id><Text>My daughter got the mint and chocolate shake without alcohol. She really likes that one, gets it just about every time. My youngest likes the strawberry limeade and she ordered the spaghetti with a hamburger on top. She Said it was really good, and she gets spaghetti a lot of places. My oldest ordered the mac and cheese balls and she always likes those with the bacon ketchup. I know what I'm getting into when I go to Slater 50/50 when it comes to vegan options, but my daughter's really like it. I tried the frickles and we all got to laugh out of that name. They were really good and the quality had a nice crisp bite. I didn't ask if the batter was vegan but my fingers were crossed. They did not have kombucha which would have been nice I got the ginger beer instead< /Text><Rate>5</Rate><time>1613078212160< /time>< gmapID>

I tried the Nashville Hot sandwich and it offered the traditional hot spice you'd expect from the name. However, I desired more of a crunch to the sandwich, flavor was all there. The fries were kind of bland as well, I normally want to crave more, I threw most away. Still going to go back for the main stream meals though, they look enticing.</Review>

<review>Love their burgers! The BBB Bacon burger and the PB and J burger are excellent. Bacon ketchup for the fries is a nice touch. Huge selection on beers on draft and great atmosphere. They also offer dining for your dog on outside patio with a menu of 4 or 5 different items available for them to enjoy. They offer a great lunch special for $10 Monday through Friday from 11a.m. to 2 p.m. which includes various burgers with fries or other menu items.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80dd21311cd07929:0xf8813ae98dd549d7</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Worth the stop if you're in the area! Burgers are on point. Service is very prompt and friendly. Tip: they have sweet potato fries, get the PUMPKIN sauce. I am not a huge lover of pumpkin. However our server brought us some and it became a quick addiction.<//Review>

Service here has always been great.
Food is fresh and flavorful, and always well prepared. I love that my burgers are never over cooked or dry.
The atmosphere is great as well, not too loud, but fun.
10/10 would always choose to go back here.< /Text>

<Text>This place is all about burgers. They get the bun just right and have a unique Hawaiian burger on the menu. Try it out. Most of the selections also come with bacon, including the desserts!!</Text><date>1561436683845< /date><Response>None<//Response><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRUB_-nMaaI-CR6fHi82xsIHiE1uWG2ncbtVt-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>3<//Rate><text>Keep in mind my review reflects an establishment that just opened back up for business days earlier.
Our family outing was seated quickly, with 10 people present.
1) By the time our appetizers came, we still had not received flatware or napkins, we had to ask. My food item was sent back twice for being incomplete, order special requests like no cheese on pizza was overlooked.
All in all, a rough experience, but I could tell the staff was hastily trained.
I'd go back again, just not right away.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

< review>
Hamburger Heaven! I've been bringing my family to eat here and the Anaheim spot for a few years now. I must say I'm never disappointed. When you can build your own burger how can it get any better? Plenty of signature burgers to choose from as well as. And if that doesn't tempt you the amount of craft beers on tap definitely will! They have a bar area, outside seating (HB location) and a family friendly atmosphere.</review>

<text>Place has good food but right now they only have limited patio seating and I only saw 1 person working there we waited 20 minutes get seated and another 15 minutes with no server. Not the servers fault she was working by herself on every table we got up up left not worth the wait< /text><Date>1596412302068<//Date>< userid>

Remember when Slater's first showed up? Yes, me too, but I didn't go then. Nope. All the rage...and I still didn't go. I finally went yesterday. I got the original 50/50 & it was just okay. I don't know what I expected, but for me the patty tasted more like a fatty hamburger. I didn't really taste the bacon so much. My husband claimed that it tasted more like a little bit of ham in with a beef patty. However, the brioche bun was delicious, and the egg and avocado tasty too. Tots were perfectly crisp and the bacon ketchup was more of a textural thing for me. I could tell there was something in my ketchup but again, it didn't really taste like bacon. I think I'll stick to bacon on top of my burgers. The server was absolutely sweet & she did a great job! Would I go back? Sure. I just don't know that I would order that again. I'll stick to 100% beef or chicken. The 50/50 just didn't do it for me. Meh. 🤷</text>

Came for my birthday and need to make the trip again. I made my own vs having the 50/50 burger. Also want to taste the PB&J burger. My wife says it's crazy good even for a weird concept.<//Text>

Definitely not for calorie counters, which I'm not so I loved it. You can't beat half bacon and half beef patty. The pizza burger was delicious.< /text>

The  50/50 burger was Awesome!! 50% beef 50% bacon.. what!!! What’s not to love about it. Then I got hit with “Vampire Dip” the most amazing artichoke garlic smooth dip I have ever had. MUST HAVE I recommend it EVERYONE... someone get me the recipe please. And to top it off they have a great selections of beers (if that’s your thing)</text>

The 50/50 burger was delicious and the beer list was excellent. I was glad I stopped by while on the west coast. Only a couple minute drive from Huntington Beach. Establishment includes bar, indoor seating and small outdoor seating.<//Text>

<Review>I understand that with everything going on right things can be rough for restaurants but when you deliberately talk down to the customer and refuse to let the customer know that the drink they ordered is out and they have to find out 30 minutes later by the bartender bringing the food and not the waitress, on a very slow night of only 4 tables being filled, I draw the line. My husband ordered his burger as medium that way it would be juicer and they gave it well done, half burnt, and as dry as possible, our "wings" which were sloppy chicken fillets weren't even crispy and the breading came off at the tiniest touch. The bun to my burger might as well been a wet sponge because I couldnt even eat since it turned to slop. Not sure if I'm going to give this place another chance.< /Review>< user>

<review>Yeah the burgers are big and good, but it's a bit Overkill if you ask me. It is tasty though.    They have crazy burgers like the pb&j burger and the pizza burger.  But it's kind of expenditure.  Just go to in and out.<//review>< pics>

Food is delicious - the burgers are the only way to go!
I'm glad to hear they're moving to a new location - the current one feels a little dated (all the TVs are great for sports though!)< /Text>

<text>Really like this new location and simplified menu. Still able to build incredible burgers but the rest of the menu has been cut down to the favorites. Much easier parking than last location, I was a bit surprised they were not more busy on a Friday night. Had the flat bread pizzas for the first time and they are fantastic! Will definitely be back to visit. Tons of TV's to catch the games and super helpful managers<//text>< user>

<text>They use just the right amount of fat in their patties to keep it moist. I usually get mine medium with vampire cheese, that cheese is gold. I like the slightly sweet dip that comes with the sweet potato fries too, it's so good. Service is always good here and it's definitely a messy burger so ask for a lot of napkins.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I had Chicken strips and fries, And everyone else had burgers. We all we very happy with the food. We sat on couches and they were pretty used looking. They had little pig stools, but they were totally food covered, as nd nasty. That's the only complaint. So, if you don't mind eating in what seems like a nasty living room, then cool...<//Text>< Pics>

Not bad I like how you can build your own Burger, I am not much of a burger girl it was a stretch for me to even try it! Lots of vegetarian options and of course if you're not vegetarian you have to try the 50% bacon 50% beef party. They have the cutest little sliders ever!<//text>

My rating of a four is because of two main reasons:
1.  It was very confusing where to park.  We actually called the restaurant and asked where to park because it was quite unclear and parking next to the restaurant was virtually nonexistent.
2.  The prices were higher than I expected as well (ex. $13 milkshake).<//text>< Response>

<text>Just ate one of the best burgers I've ever had. 50/50 beef & bacon was so tasty. Milkshake was also incredible. More of a family environment to watch games (not as much of a sports bar feel) than other bars or grills. First class restaurant here.< /text>< Pics>

Staff was so great. Food was huge and delish. Made a custom 50/50 burger with TWO 1/3 pound burgers. Sooooo good. Sweet potato fries are perfect. I didn't care for the pumpkin sauce as it made it too sweet...but it's all yummy. Will be coming back ASAP!< /Review>

Everything overall was great. Lone star hamburger was delicious. Kids meal was very generous and had healthy options. Only complaint is that the onion rings was sitting in oil on my plate.<//Text>

<Text>Bartender Bleue is absolutely the best. Chill demeanor but extremely customer centric. I highly recommend the Impossible Burger with whatever you want on it. Beyond amazing ❤️ and you can't go wrong with the lava cake w/bacon. Perfect end to a perfect visit at a perfect place ❤️<//Text>< pics>

<review>Really bad delivery experience. Order arrived cold and under-cooked. Called restaurant to ask about a remedy. They blamed everything on Grubhub and Post Mates. Store manager Is incredibly arrogant and very condescending:

Will never order delivery from Slater’s 50/50 again. Restaurant has very  poor customer service.<//review><Resp>None</Resp><username>Becki Mabry</username>< Rating>

A really cool place!! Fun waiting room, great burgers. Try the artichoke vampire dip in a bread bowl, wow that was good. You can build your own burger and name it, for when they bring it out to you. The staff were friendly and ready to serve.< /text>

<Review>They are finally in their new Beach Blvd location. The service and food as well and bar are back to their previous high standards. Food was great, serviced hot and very fresh tasting. Beer and wine selection was good. Nice open floor plan with lots of booths and flexible seating. Both servers and managers were very attentive providing a satisfying experience.</Review>< UserId.>

I absolutely love their burgers! I full heartedly recommend trying the peanut butter and jealousy! It's way better than I expected it to be!

Or you can build your own burger if you want! Great place overall!<//Text>

Excellent service, and the food is great. Lots of options to choose from for your total delight. A bit pricey  for a burger joint, wouldn't make it a weekly kind of outing
But I did enjoy it.</Text>

My 3 rating comes from the quality of the burger for the $ spent.  Def up a step from Carl’s Jr. on quality and size. The atmosphere is fun with a great greasy enticing menu. There are some healthy options too. I like the variety of choices somewhat similar to a Hooters or Chili’s.

I enjoyed my burger. It was around 15 bucks, but it was large in size and filling.  Good toppings and great bacon! Decent fries too.

I suppose the true rating at Slater’s would be 3.5. Solid good food, but a bit pricey.  As is most things in this zip code.
Great waiter and service!
If the burger is most important to you go to In N Out or Five Guys.
But for other options, a better place to hang out with more choices on a bigger budget: Go to Slater’s 50/50<//review>

<Text>Slater's, you're good. I like this new restaurant,  it's big and not as loud as the old place. We walked right in on a Sunday night, plenty of room- no wait. However, it's missing a lot of the old location's charm. I'm sure on game night, it's probably standing room only with a fantastic energy, but this night it was missing some sparkle. They also don't carry some of our old favorites, which is a bummer when something is that good- you want it to be around forever. All in all, great service, good food and a fantastic drink selection... Just feels like it's missing something.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user>111053529123902772175</user></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I love this place I've been coming here since the week it opened. They continue to adjust to the needs of their customers by adding things like the no wait app, and when it was necessary even valet parking. Definitely some of the best burgers I've ever had, pro tip go outside your comfort zone and try something different! It's all good. I've experienced a few snafus with service but the majority of servers are excellent and some of the best I've ever experienced have worked there.< /Review>< Pics>

So good! They know flavor! We're from Arizona and had a party of 8 and they accommodated us with no problem.  Their burgers are delicious. I had the turkey rosemary sandwich and it was one of the best sandwiches I have had.  My fiance had the peanut butter and jelly burger with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream on top and wow different but it works.  And the shakes are huge!! Go you won't be disappointed.< /Text>

Excellent food. If you love bacon in and on everything, this is the best place. They also have all the sports in their TVs.</review>

The food here is phenomenal. Definitely an interesting burger. Half ground beef, half ground bacon. Couldn't ask for more with that alone! I had the PB&J burger and my buddy had the spiciest one he could find on the menu - stacked with several peppers. Also, Slater's has an excellent beer selection, with options ranging from IPAs to porters and stouts.</Review>

She was slow to take our order, the burgers were very good. However if you order onion rings with your burger  be prepared to be very disappointed.. I received  only (4) onion rings..  I had to order fries to make the meal work. Thank God for the hostess who got me fries and pickles to go with my burger.<//Text>< Date>

79 different types of beer, giant sized burgers, deep fried pickles and maple bacon shake. Biggest complaint...dogs in the restaurant (not service dogs) because of this I will not return.< /Text>

One of the best burgers I've had! Get the OG 50/50 and thank me later.
Place was very clean and open. Loved that you could see into the kitchen. Make sure to make reservations because the wait can be up to an hour. Crazy, but good.<//Review>

It was a sunday and was not busy (5pm to 8pm) Idk what happened but I had not been there in years and I talked it up to my coworkers. When we went they all complained about the same thing. Idk what happened but years ago the old place would be packed on a sunday night and the food was always on point. I honestly will be hard pressed to come back. I'll give it a second chance  but not anytime in the near future.</review><gmapID>0x80dd21311cd07929:0xf8813ae98dd549d7<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Came in a party of 8 with no reservation the Sat. before mothers day. The place was a bit empty, but became extremely busy within the hr. This was our first time here so it took us a while to figure out our orders. The waitress was one of (what I saw) four total waitresses. She was very nice but spread way too thin. We ordered an appetizer that never came and a salad which came 30 after every else's meal. The food overall was very good and the staff was friendly and accommodating.< /text>

<review>They're 50/50 burger doesn't taste very good. The double Patty Burger is two patties smashed into one. Strawberry lemonade  was worse than Minute Maid brand. On the plus side, the vampire dip taste good and they have naughty sauce craft beer.<//review><Name>Ramon Raya< /Name>< user>

< Review>
For my first time going the service was okay server did her job decent the burger I ordered was there special 50/50 tbh I was disappointed first the Patty was undercooked had more pink then should have it was also just bland didn't really have a taste the grilled onions were burnt and thrown on the burger I got onion rings as well and they were not anything as the server hype them up to be they were as the burger bland no taste
Small and skimpy the only thing that I kinda like was the bacon it was thick and cook decent I got a beer as well which the server recommend and it was whatever in total I paid about 30 bucks for just me the food was wack and for the price I well definitely won't go back again I rather go to islands up the street much better food for a better price<//Review>

Would not go back, very greasy food. Did not feel well after eating there. All four of us ordered something different and all of us felt so full and no energy. Overall do not waste your calories or money because there are better burger places to go!< /text>

<Text>Awesome burgers! I'm not a big pork eater, so I didn't opt for the bacon induced burger, but their regular patties are great. They offer tasty specialty burgers and their sweet potato fries are especially good. The only thing is I would love to see more actual independent breweries featured on their extensive tap selection. Also, Kenny is a great bartender. Would definitely recommend Slater's.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Review>Amazing burgers with some amazing milkshakes. For me though the best thing I ordered was the vampire dip. The dip was perfect down to the bowl bread and the chips on the side. I will make sure to add the vampire dip cheese to my burger.<//Review>< Pics>

Gave it a second try thinking they just needed to work out the kinks... They DID just open, I'm sure at that point (End of August), they had pretty much just opened at the new location so I was willing to try again.

First visit was ok except our server was not very attentive and the food was not as flavorful as we expected.

Last time around the food was a bit better and our server was a bit better... Before we took off we wanted to have a quick shot. The bartender took my debit card card, checked my ID and password out all in my party that I was ordering a shot for, making sure we were all 21+, than handed me back my debit card. She kept me standing at her well for nearly 5 minutes, finishing her cycle at the bar, than went to the back for a minute. After chit chatting with a couple of the guys at the bar for a few minutes I went back to my table and asked my party what they thought. We decided to cancel the shot & go. When asked by another person in my party, the bartender gladly cancelled the order and went about her duties. (I guess)

Disappointing.<//review>

Great as always but the new location seems like it's an odd layout. The coolest thing are the couches you can sit down at and eat. They took Fritos off the add list for burgers which is a bummer but they replaced them with Potato Chips. Great atmosphere and beautiful interior.< /review>

Very unique. Great wait staff.
I like that there's something different here. I like dark beers. They recommended a peanut butter stout, that went really well with a PB & Jellyousy burger. Sounds odd, I'll admit, but a great taste pairing.</review>

Get the beer flight. Theyve got some really good beer options. Most people like their bacon ketchup, and although I love bacon and I love ketchup, the two together was over rated. Just ask for a side of their BBQ sauce. It's honestly the best bbq sauce I've ever had< /review>

I used to come here and love it. Had my usual V&C shake and it definitely wasn't worth the $10 bucks it used to be. Are they using lower quality ice cream and syrups now? The whip on top was so sloppy and tasteless, too. What gives? So disappointed.<//Review>

<Review>I would like to rate this higher, but the burger just wasn't cooked. Well, actually it was, for enough time to brown the outside, but the inside was much more rare than I like.

Wasn't crowded when I went which is highly unusual because it is usually very crowded. We came here during a weekday for a birthday. It seems like the popularity of this place has really died down. I remember coming here and this place was packed all nights during the week and weekend. There was hardly anyone in here for it being a weekday night during dinner time. Either way the service and food was good.<//Text>

I've had Slater's on my list for several years but was never close enough to justify going there. Finally I've tried it and it lives up to the hype. The burgers are delicious and well prepared and the ability to build your own is nice for those picky eaters who always have to substitute. I got the sricha burger which was very good, but not particularly spicy. The Mac and cheese balls come as a set of 5 and are a great appetizer. Unfortunately the burgers don't come with fries, but you can add them (I chose sweet potato fries). Good selection of beer on tap and there's a full bar if you want something stronger. Finished off the meal with the giant brownie which I do not recommend unless you have four people to share it - it's massive and rich.

Only thing I saw was that there are very few "healthy" options built in. The focus is obviously on the 50/50 beef/bacon burger and not on chicken or turkey. You CAN substitute these in though for what it's worth.  Just disappointed that they don't have a burger built around the chicken.<//Text>

<Review>Certain items are amazing here. The vampire dip is great, beer is awesome and burgers are good. A lot of people I have talked to don't care for the 50/50 burger. Half beef in the patty and half bacon. It just tastes too salty to me personally. The regular beef patty is better in my opinion. Its a SD Chargers themed restaurant, and even though i don't like the chargers, its a worth wile place to eat. I definitely recommend this place. Only thing is everything is heavy so be in the mood for comfort food.< /Review><Resp>None</Resp>< user>

I was with a group, but I'll only speak for myself: The service is slow due to lack of servers, the chicken lettuce wraps are fried til charred chicken strips chopped up and added to flavorless pineapple/jicama and placed in Iceberg lettuce leaves. The fries were good.</Text>

Stood inside the entrance for 10 minutes waiting behind three people.  Was not greeted.  Lady with the set of keys around her arm that looked like the manager, did not have a smile on her face the entire time and couldn't have cared less that anyone was waiting to be seated or signed-in or even greeted...should not be the hostess.  Other people with a reservation behind us were spoken to but no one else waiting to be seated was talked to, greeted or even smiled at. This was at 6:30 on Saturday night and we left to go someplace else where a restaurant wants our business.  Horrible experience... bad employees... owners need to fix that!< /text>

OKAY, I say this super dramatic but super serious all at the same time.

Slaters 50/50 is a place you want to go to whether you're a local, a tourist, a lost transient, or whoever else you may be that finds yourself in proximity to one of these heavenly locations.

Consider yourself blessed and get your butt inside to order and eat.

I'm a vegetarian but they had veggie options for me as well as fish burgers I'm pretty sure. I know you can sub any party for a veggie one as well so that's normally what I've done. I've picked the burger that sounded best by what was on it and then just swap it out for a veggie patty and perfection!<//Text>

Always love this place, but I seriously wish they would switch to uncured nitrate free bacon so I could get the full 50/50 experience 😒</Review>

<text>Went with bf mid day on week day so the place is practically empty. The burgers are good. Big burgers that u have to cut to take a bite or risk a messy face. Waitress is pleasant and place look clean. There's a branch opening closer to my house so we will definitely go.< /text>< username>

The food is great, beer is cold, and service is excellent. Inside, the music is so loud, we can't enjoy a conversation.  Lower the volume, please, we come to enjoy the food and beer, AND hearing each other.<//text>

Great burgers. We've been hesitant to go since we went keto, since their French fries are so amazing (especially sweetpotatoe fries with pumpkin mayo), but their burger bowls were excellent.  I  really lived my Siracha burger, a lovely amount of heat, and so much flavor</text>

50/50 beef/bacon burgers are their signature. Parking is a lot better than the old location. Good place to bring the family for burgers. Also has  sports bar seating.<//review>

Burgers are top notch. Even have a gluten free bun option. The service is stellar. Good selection of beers, nice casual atmosphere. The only reason I refrained from 5 stars is some of their side items lack flavor or have an undesirable flavor/texture.<//text>

I have aways wanted to goto Slater's for the famed half and half patty. Where everything is bacon and amazing. I was rather disappointed if I'm honest. The bacon infusion not only overpowered everything it touched, it didnt really add a beneficial flavor since it was almost entirely of smoke flavor.

It wasnt all bad, the wings were tasty and the "vampire dip" tasted good, but the amount they gave wasn't even enough to use the dippers they served with it. Fun to try once, but wont be going back.</Text>

<rate>4< /rate><review>Great place to have an Impossible Burger which is way superior to Beyond Burgers. Beyond burgers are okay but you can taste and smell the bean protein they have in it. Impossible burgers when cooked right are deliciously crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. You can't get over how much this plant based patty tastes like actual meat. Umami Burger and Park Bench Cafe also offer Impossible Burgers, but Park Bench overcooks their patty to look and taste like a disgusting McDonald's patty and it was just okay at Umami Burger. Slater's 50/50 makes one hell of an Impossible Burger and its accompaniments were spot on to make a very tasty plant based burger. Glad they make an incredible Impossible burger here in my own backyard that rivals the amazing one I had up in Solvang.

I love taking my dog with me when I go out so the outdoor dog friendly seating was an extra plus. They have a dog menu with items like turkey patty, beef patty, their 50/50 patty and chicken tenders. I brought a bowl for my pup along with some kibbles to mix in with the patty after I cut it up for her.

Negatives were not offering water for my dog when they're a dog friendly establishment and their outdoor seating area was covered in dirt and debris. I had water for my dog, but I find it standard for establishments to offer water in take out containers for your pups nowadays and no offer was made. Even after doing their best to wipe down the tables I had to pull out my own Wet Ones to clean my area more. Other outdoor patios have way better upkeep.

We were all happy with our food and the service was pleasant and quick. Their price is what it is so I'm not going to get angry about it and have it affect my rating, but it will affect how often I come here. I took off one star for the upkeep of their outdoor seating area and not providing that extra above and beyond step offering my dog water to leave a stand out impression on me. I do believe prices were lower when they were at their other location on Adam's. Great if they adjust their prices in the future. If not, then there are plenty of other delicious and diverse food offerings in Southern California at a better price point if you dine out casually frequently. We're busy people and dine out 80% of the week allowing for one guilt free day of eating unhealthy foods. This isn't fine dining by any means, so it does have to bother most sensible people a bit when a burger at a very casual place does seem a bit overpriced. I believe my Impossible Burger was around $18 for anyone that is curious (included a small side of fries with bacon ketchup). On the other hand I went to a fine dining establishment in Solvang and believe I paid a little less for their Impossible burger there, so that is the basis for my comparison.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

More than just a restaurant, Slater's is an experience. Everyone should try a PBnJ burger at least once in their life. And for the truly adventurous, scoop some vanilla ice cream on to each bite, you won't regret it.<//text>

<Text>Went to Slater’s 50/50 a large party of about 16 of my good friends. I must state that I know this is a new place that just opened and some leeway should be granted but that there is no excuse for the poor treatment that I received at this establishment. Let me start by saying the waitstaff are incompetent to say the least not comprehending the simple basics of how to take an easy order of a burger and milkshake. I realize that 16 is a large party but it is inexcusable for individuals to be served in 15 minute intervals with 3 people’s orders being completley forgotten. Overall I am angry just thinking about this place and would not recommend it to someone I even hate.< /Text>< GmapID>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>I went in on my only day off of the week to have a good meal with my wife and daughter but man was it the worst. First a woman with black hair comes by to take our drink orders but the attitude and glare she would give us as we spoke to her screamed I hate this job! We ordered appetizers and they never arrived when a seperate person came and took our burger order, burgers came, quickly, strangely enough and surprise the burgers were raw now im not a dlicate eater when it comes to meat and man do I love a medium rare steak but this burger was RAW pink! I wanted to come and drop some money i am not a stingy tipper but not once did we get a refill not once and everyone excluding the girl who took us to our table looked at us with disdain and obviously did not wanna help us in the slightest! Any way bad experience and am never coming back again my advice just go to in n out! We all know its better.<//Review>< Date>

<Review>I went to the new Slater's 50/50 on Beach and Warner in Huntington Beach first off it's way too bright for a night time bar atmosphere the walls are a jail like gray color it's not too appealing the service was no good it took maybe 10-15 minutes to get a drink. We weren't even greeted at the bar the bartenders back was to us he saw us but he never even said hello. The food was okay it was a little too spicy for my taste and it didn't say in the menu that it was spicy. The bartender kept saying that their delivery didn't get there cuz he was out of a few things that we ordered my boyfriend ordered a beer and he was out of it, I understand about starting a new establishment but it was a little bit ridiculous they didn't work out the Kinks at all their employees were kind of just standing around chit-chatting with each other I was very disappointed because I did have an enjoyable time at the other location on Beach and Talbert in Huntington Beach.</Review>< Pics>

It is not like I remember it.  The burger patty is not a fresh made one but a processed frozen one.  That is. It worth $15.  Parking somewhat sucks but their is a parking garage a little ways away passed the gym.<//Text>

<Review>Amazing burger and possibly the best service I have received in a long time.  Everyone from the hostess to the bartender to the waiter was excellent.  The macaroni and cheese balls were awesome!  I definitely recommend!  Almost forgot to say... great beer selection and they have Delirium Tremens on tap!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Great burger place with 50% bacon 50% beef patties.  Lots of original burger creations or create your own.  Good selection of beer too.  A bit pricey, but worth it for good burgers.<//text>

<text>I have eaten here several times and have yet to be disappointed by anything I have tried.  Be prepared to wait a bit if you get there during the lunch rush or dinner rush.  But the wait is well worth it.  The appetizers are great.  I love the fried pickles and especially the vampire dip (I always get it on my burger too).  The burgers are made to order and you can customize them however you want, from different types of meats, buns, condiments, and toppings.  I have not made a burger I haven't loved.  For those in a rush or those that don't want to endlessly customize they have a menu of popular burger choices.  I haven't tried any of them yet but they always look quite tasty.  Their beer selection is great, ranging from your regular beers all the way to several craft beers.  The restaurant is big and a bit noisy but it's a great place for a large group of people or just a fun messy date night.  Go to Slaters if you want a great burger and super filling meal!<//text>< Pics>

Was in there tonight and the service was sub par and the food was terrible. Missing half of the toppings I ordered, drinks were a hassle to get filled. Server brought my wife a drink and reached over my near empty glass and i still had to request a refill. I remember when this place used to be good and the service was great but now I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I'd rather go to McDonalds the service is better and they dont mess up my order.</Text>

Place has gone down hill. Burgers are way over cooked, beer selection is minimal.
Miss the old menu.
Over priced and McDonalds is better at this point.</review>

Food was ok. It seems like the food was better at the other location on Adams. Service was extremely slow and our server did not seem too interested in us. We constantly had to ask for refills,he never once went an got them on his own.<//review>

If your craving a hamburger this is your spot. If your craving an amazing, juicy, probably the best burger o your life this is also your spot. I can't say enough about how good the burgers are here and the service staff are really goo and friendly. Lots of draft beer and tons of tv's located throughout.</Review>

<text>The food here is absolutely fantastic! My favorite burger here is the Peanut Butter and Jellousy with the signature 50/50 patty ( Half beef, half pork)! It's a combination of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a juicy, perfectly cooked burger! Our service is just as great as the food. They're always very friendly and inviting!

P.S. They have killer desserts!!!</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<review>If your craving a hamburger this is your spot. If your craving an amazing, juicy, probably the best burger o your life this is also your spot. I can't say enough about how good the burgers are here and the service staff are really goo and friendly. Lots of draft beer and tons of tv's located throughout.<//review><response>None</response>< userid>

My own personal kitchen nightmare:
My wife and I showed up and were seated at a high top.  We got a menu and had to wait around a bit for the server to take our order.  Nothing too crazy, but the place wasn't very busy, so no reason it should have taken that long  (server seemed too busy chatting with his friends or flirting with the girls a few tables down).

We ordered chips and cheese dip with guacamole and two of their 50/50 Original burgers. We waited at least 30-40 minutes and my wife was 5 minutes from walking out when all of our food arrived at once.  Once we'd sampled some of it, we were wishing we'd just left.

The "green chili queso" was clearly just nacho cheese from a can. The guac was a brownish green and watery (Frozen? From a bag?).  The salsa would have been better from a jar...it tasted fairly fresh, but underseasoned, bland.  Like someone just blitzed salsa ingredients in a blender and failed to salt or allow flavors to mingle.

Then the burger.  I'd been looking forward to trying their signature 50/50 beef/bacon patty. Unfortunately it was a huge letdown.  I got a very odd smokiness from it.  Not like wood smoke, but more like a spent firework.  I can only guess it's the nitrates?  The entire burger felt a bit too chewy.  My guess is that they make these way way ahead of time and probably freeze them.  The entire burger felt like it was "cured", rather than being a fresh grind of bacon and beef.

The server comped us the chips and cheese based on the late arrival, but when we asked for our check having only eaten a total of 3 bites of the burgers, and declined to box anything up, he didn't feel it was pertinent to ask if there was anything wrong with our meals.

We paid $33 for a really awful meal and some seriously shoddy service.  I'm giving this place one more star than it deserves.<//Text>

Great beer selection and build your own burger menu. We sat outside on the patio with our 3 dogs, they bright water for them and even have a dog menu with a couple of items on it.<//text>

< review>
I called in to the hostess and asking if they had any deals or any happy hour she didn't know she didn't know the menu she didn't know the happy hour for the even had one I got there it was not happy hour even though she said there was even though they honored it I got to the happy hour menu the dishes are still relatively expensive but for appetizers they were a lot smaller in size. I ordered one of everything on that appetizer menu I got mozzarella sticks that didn't have cheese in them no mozzarella in them whatsoever I got a bucket of tater tots and there may be about like 15 in there the lettuce wraps or Bland they had no sauce for them whatsoever. The only appetizer I thought that was good was probably the chips and dip the bartender was great her name is blue she was attentive and fulfilling my soda and she was knowledgeable about the beers. The hot dog appetizer pretty much look like one hot dog slicing the three and they charge $6 for it the bread was not bake or heat it up at all so it was cold and kind of stale tasting. The pretzels were overly salted tasted like they were microwaved. I have been here before and I usually get a burger the burgers don't come with sides but the burgers are delicious but they do cost an arm and a leg as well. It's a decent place to watch sports games they have tons of TVs that's why I didn't give it a one. If a friend ever want to try this place I wouldn't necessarily deter them but I would probably eat beforehand because if you're hungry I hope you bring a ton of cash I would still enjoy a game there though< /review>

They no longer barbeque the burgers at this location. So you're paying a fortune for a flavorless pan fried meat patty. Don't waste your money here.</review>

Huge beer selection. Bacon mixed right into the burger meat. What's not to love?  The build your own burger menu is great, but if you don't feel that creative, the specialty burgers are all awesome. Peanut  butter and jealousy is always a winner.< /text>

Used to be great.Went from day 1.  There is nothing these days to compliment this place.  Wings we've ordered forever were awful, could barely knew thru the impossible sliders.  Were out of my regular 4 Sons sour beer so substituted with another...failed to tell me it was $10 more a glass . Wings (sucked), 3 sliders and a few beers...$110.  We've done that at much finer restaurants.  Shame Slaters....you used to be so good. Glad you're leaving.....< /review>

I was surprised that this place was not packed as it used to be for when football season started. Perhaps this will not be the case once they move to their new location in the near future. Food still great.<//review>

<text>The chefs messed up our order three times! They took the longest to take our order and bring our food. It was an overall egregious experience. The manger was not sympathetic for us at all and gave us a 10% discount for disatisfactory on the bill. Overall, if your food is messed up, just know that you won't be compensated as to what is truly fair!<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dd21311cd07929:0xf8813ae98dd549d7</Gmap_id>< pics>

Watched a video review on the food channel (unsure of which location), and heard good things. ..HOWEVER-...we Visited the Huntington Beach store New Years Day so maybe its all due to NYE. Had to send back the 50/50- the egg whites were still clear & runny. The flatware was not ready to be seated with guests. Service was mediocre to be nice.  Bottom line: The food was Greasy (burger patty dry), Gamey, Undercooked,  and Overpriced. Why did I stay long enough for this review?  The Beer menu is extensive.  Pricey, but expansive.  If all you want is Beer, than perhaps this is for You.  PARK AWAY and walk or you'll get hooked by valet parking-  access to free parking was barracaded!!! Crooks.</review>

I wish Google had ZERO! Star reviews. No one welcomed us coming in or even when we sat down. A guy just gave us water without welcoming us and just left. We grew inpatient and got up and left. The lady said "have a good day." Like really, worst customer service.<//Text>

Greasy greasy greasy food as if they refried their old french fries insteaf of cooking new one. Quinoa burger has been fried as well in . . . the fryer as well not grill.
Michelada taste like the one you buy done not home made.
Tons of sauce on all beef burgers 😵.
The best are their flat bread 5 stars
The rest Nope nope nope and nope again.<//text>

<text>This isnt going to be nice, I really once loved Slaters, especially this location.

The beer selection is down, the waitress seated us off to a nice corner of the place near a family with screaming kids. And wanted to put us in the center booth, of which would be fine but she put the next two parties to arrive on either side of us. The wings all sucked, over cooked, the only good thing anymore is if you get a burger XD Which was never the key part of my slaters experience over the years. I can see why these restaurants have been closing, they just need fresh management on the regional and restaurant level, probably a few good people put to work in  marketing and advertising to help stay afloat with the market, I thought they were aiming to gather. Young adults 21 to 30 who enjoy good burgers with good appetizers, some good beers with some good friends.<//text><name>Derek Ray On His Android Gaming Account</name><user>103726769722355634166</user><GmapID>0x80dd21311cd07929:0xf8813ae98dd549d7< /GmapID><Rate>2</Rate><pictures>None</pictures><date>1517870328778<//date>< response>

< review>
The regular burger my friend got was juicy and delicious. I had the peanut butter and jealousy. The burger was decent but a I was alittle disappointed because the waitress told me it's her favorite.  It took me forever to finish the burger because it had so much peanut butter.

If you're their to enjoy the food, get either the regular burger or the thanksgiving burger. If you're feeling adventurous like me then I'd recommend the peanut butter one.

My friend and i showed up around 7:30 thursday night. There was a wait but it wasnt that bad. Server was attentive. Atmosphere was pretty loud.</review>

<review>BACON BACON BACON! Bacon Salt (amazing)! Bacon Ketchup (not bad), Peanut Butter, Jelly and Bacon Hamburger (herr-ma-gerrd)!!! If you're a burger lover, this is an experience you can't miss. All the burgers are great and tasty (got to try three of them - the BBB Burger, Bison Chipotle Burger, and the PB&J&Bacon Burger). I recommend getting the wing appetizer, and putting some of that Bacon Salt on them - it's more Bacon-ish than salty!</review><pics>None<//pics><userid>114525173162059543355</userid></record>

I don't get down to these neck of the woods very often anymore so I hadn't been to this particular Slater's since their grand opening like 2-3 years ago? A few friends and I had a bunch of coupons that we'd won at various events so we decided to get together for their Wed free pub quiz night and make the coupons rain! The six of us got there around 8pm and the place was pretty busy--we had to wait a few minutes to get seated. I've been a fan since they first opened; not just of their food, which has always been good, but of their uniformly congenial, helpful staff. I don't think I've ever run into a rude server at any of their locations and this location was no different, I'm happy to say. From the hostess to our fantastic server Bryan and all the other various servers who assisted him that night, everyone was unfailingly cheerful and helpful, which is no mean feat when it's at the end of a long day and a table wants to slap you with 5 coupons and is constantly asking you for beer samples, lol. Bryan didn't bat an eye to any of it and treated us great all night. That's not to say there weren't a couple of hiccups: a veggie burger came out with a turkey patty and our apps came out at uneven times, but I think those are pretty minor quibbles, all things considered.

I got my usual 50/50 burger, and it was just as good as I remembered--there's something magical about the combination of the avocado mash, their 50/50 patty, the brioche bun and the fried egg. I've tried a bunch of their other burgers but this is the one I always come back to. We got an order of half reg fries and half sweet potato fries, which were also great. The pub quiz was fun, although it was a little hard to hear the announcer guy at times (we were kind of on the outer edge). It's free to play and you win various Slaters-related merch and food (more coupons!). Alas, we didn't come close to placing in the top three but we had a blast, nonetheless. They had happy hour prices during the quiz so that helped, and I didn't even mention the free corkage! We'd brought a couple of bottles of wine with us and we didn't get charged for using their glasses, lol. A nice combination of great customer service and tasty food on this visit!< /review>

Wonderful (and wonderfully unhealthy) top shelf burgers. The grilled brussels sprouts are an unexpected but tasty appetizer. Perfectly caramelized and peppered with sinfully delicious thick cut bacon and shaved parmesan. My wife had the (slightly) healthier turkey burger. It was juicy and had a fantastic flavorful punch of rosemary, for her this is now the bar that all other turkey burgers must meet. I had the sriracha burger which was packed with spicy goodness. From the sriracha spiced 50% beef / 50% ground bacon patty, to the need a cigarette afterwards glazed sriracha bacon, to the creamy sriracha aioli, this burger mounts a flavor assault on you taste buds, but stops appropriately short of the scorched earth (tongue) that it could have easily fallen into. We also shared some fried pickles that were a credit to the southern culinary tradition that they came from. The batter was crispy and adhered well to the thick cut house made pickle chips but wasn't too thick and doughy. The servers were very friendly and attentive and as a bonus, the patio outside is dog friendly.</review>

I ordered the FLAMIN’ HOT - carne asada fire beef, pepper jack, beer battered jalapeño, roasted green chile, chipotle adobo mayo, brioche. The peppers were very flavorful with out being super hot. A very good burger! If you are by one of their locations give it a try.</review></record></dataset><record>

This is a great place. The bartenders are really fun as well as adding to the fun. If you need anything just ask. We were going to sit at a table, and had so much fun with them we stayed and ate at the bar. However, when we ot the bill for two people? IT was OUTRAGEOUS. There's a drink called a cinnamon ball? I believe? Well, it's a shot, and unless you  want to pay $7.00 for a shot of cinnamon, (they really talk it up a lot) it was ok, NOT a full shot. A total waste. My friend had 3 beers, beers as well, were WAY over priced. It was $137.00 for 2 people and BEFORE the tip? We split an appetizer as well as split their famous (burger & bacon)  sandwhich.(Not what it's cracked up to be by any means.  Other then the GREAT staff right from the Valet guys to ALL the employees, were ALL WONDERFUL EMPLOYEES. However, I'd NEVER go back "for the food let alone the outrageous price of drinks. NO way. Otger than that, all the Employees" deserve ALL the credit!!, Not ONE sandwhich, or ONE drink is worrth $7.50 there. Medium? Is NOT medddium. It's NO pink at all. Not worth the prices.However, the atmosphere is really great!!  Thanks. It's not the the employees fault, they don't pay set the prices! The employees ALL deserve 5 STARS. THe resturant over all, is a 3 MAX...No reflections on one employee.  Thanks.< /text>

Our server was very nice despite her appearance that made be think she had fallen into a tackle box.

The food was mediocre and pricey for a burger joint and overall I was very unimpressed.

They have valet parking which I still don't understand, the atmosphere was loud and that of a sports bar , their is nothing special about this place and I won't be returning.

(Translated by Google) This is my second visit.
It used to be the opposite alley
The interior hasn't changed much
It was a beautiful feeling!
Burger is a luxury hamburger
You are very particular about it!
It was very delicious! ️
I'm just a junkman (laughs)
The downside is that your hands get messed up 💧

(Original)
二度目の訪問です。
以前は向かいの路地でしたが
内装もあまり変わらず
綺麗な感じでした！
バーガーは高級ハンバーガー
こだわりが強いですね！
とても美味しくいただきました‼️
只僕はジャンクマンですので(笑)
欠点は手がびちゃびちゃになること💧<//review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Great food. Nice place and well frequented. Good service, friendly staff. In addition to pool tables, it offers table / board games, which I thought was great idea. However, the game of checkers we picked up was, sadly, missing a few pieces.

(Original)
Exelente comida. Lugar agradável e bem frequentado. Bom atendimento, pessoal simpático. Além de mesas de sinuca, disponibiliza jogos de mesa/tabuleiro, o que achei ótima idéia. Contudo, o jogo de damas que pegamos estava, lamentavelmente, faltando algumas peças.</text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) You are in San Diego, United States, and you want a hamburger that will truly make you hungry for a good amount of time. You have to enter Slater's 50/50! Their burgers are 50% meat and 50% bacon, a deliciously explosive combination. You can choose B 'B' B 'Bacon. It comes with bacon, melted cheese and fried egg. It's addictive and satisfying, and you'll be ready to watch your evening football game.
