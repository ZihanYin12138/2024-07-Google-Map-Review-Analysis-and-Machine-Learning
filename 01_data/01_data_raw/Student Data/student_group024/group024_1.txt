Grilled fish tacos!! ✔
Tasty salsa ✔
Friendly staff ✔
With a caravan of taco  trucks  this one is a must try. Only downfall is the 3.7percent charge on non cash transactions besides that delicious<//review>

Came all the way from Richmond. Was going to go to another taco truck that was closed today so decided to try something else. Forsure 🔥🔥 agua frescas are also good as hell.< /text>

Hands down one of the best breakfast burritos we’ve ever had. We got all three meats (chorizo, bacon, sausage) plus avocado.  Make sure to try their mild and hot(!) salsas too!  Very friendly service with a few covered picnic tables to enjoy your meal!<//text>

<Text>I was craving for some taco truck food and found this place thru Yelp. It was easy enough to find and the customer service was pretty quick and the guys working were friendly.

I was very hungry and decided to try a bunch of their menu items. I ordered a Mexican style hot dog, steak fries, and four tacos each with a different meat. The hot dog was meh. It had some kick from the peppers on top but I really didn't taste much of the sausage or the bacon that it was wrapped in. The steak fries were just ok too. The fries weren't really crispy and the steak felt dry. The green chili sauce added a lot of flavor and really made up for everything else. It was definitely filling. All four tacos were pretty standard, I didnt feel like they wowed me. The steak one was, again, dry. The birria had nice flavor but it felt muted compared to other birria I've had. The pastor wasn't very flavorful to me. The cabeza was easily my favorite part of the meal. It was flavorful, tender and made for a satisfying two-bite taco.

Overall, I would say I didn't go completely crazy about this place and its food. It wasn't really bad by any means but it definitely didn't fulfill my taco truck cravings. Maybe I came on an off night, I would probably try it again later should it cross my mind.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5P9XV7fwCXCHB0T7eO6L4Mn2AbVL_wGkh-wBg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOV6LbfJMbf3cV-uUNM_KuORARk4iPrKZTvX_LH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJCQ6u6LHiwrGEP_pfWTbP2NJ5XX-Npn8xl0jl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Awesome food truck! They have really delicious tacos. I really liked the way they fried their tortillas a little longer so it was a little crispy. They had decent tasting meats. I had the al pastor and carne asada tacos and both were great. Also come with some grilled onions on the side that were a great touch.

The guy taking the orders was pretty friendly. Parking is decent around the area which is all street. They have some tables for you to sit if you would like.</Text><Name>Kyle Liu< /Name>< user_id>

Been here before, always liked it. Never again though. Poor hygiene. Same guy who took my cash also put the straws in my drinks with his bare hands and handled our food. Threw it all out. They don’t follow COVID guidelines or enforce wearing of masks (employees/customers).</text>

Man...man... ohhhhhh man... This.. THIS spot is out of this world. I got there "Muchacho" burrito. Boyyyy let me tell you, the length of my arm (seriously) up to four meats and the WHOLE fixing's. I just got asada and Al pastor. They lightly crisp the burrito for a slight crunch. Man, drop EVERYTHING an check em out. In Napa ONLY weekdays! Definitely enjoy this find, it's my new spot and I haven't been disappointed! 😁< /Text>

Love this place. I am typically not a food truck lover, my husband is. Well, he brought me some carnitas tacos from there and I am addicted! He also says the workers are super nice. I am just upset because I am craving them now but just found out they are closed on Sundays . Oh well, they deserve a day off 😊</Review>

La carne siempre está muy SALADA. no sé si toda la gente lo nota , o solo a mi me toca muy salada.  Soy un chofer de la Vine. Por favor prueben las carnes cuando la cocinan por favor.

<review>The worst service I have ever received. Front desk is no help whatsoever, very unprofessional. However the doctor was very professional but I will never go here again due to the front desk lady. I will never recommend this place to anyone.<//review>< name>

I honestly wish I could rate this office by category. The doctor and clinical assistant are awesome. Knowledgeable, Caring, Friendly. Great back office experience. 5 stars.  Dealing with the front office staff, that's why I ended up leaving the practice.  As someone who works in healthcare I know that the office experience starts at the initial phone call, when I called to make my appointment I was not impressed with the phone etiquette, I should've known from there it was all down hill.  My initial visit with the office didn't fare any better, I cut them a lot of slack due to Covid but the front office staff didn't seem to know what they were doing, after coming out of the exam with the doctor I needed to pick out glasses and dealt with the office manager of whom I was not looking forward to seeing as I had earlier witnessed her yelling at staff in front of patient's waiting in the lobby. It was unprofessional and verbally abusive. When I came back to pick up my glasses they couldn't find them and said they couldn't find me, was I a patient there.  "Um ya, you called me to come get them!"  They finally found them and I indicated that I wanted to order contacts as well and I was very rudely told that my insurance didn't cover them. I assured her that I knew this and was going to pay out of pocket and she looked at me as if I was lying. I pre-paid for my contacts and left only to return once again when they called me that they had arrive and once again they couldn't find them and was I called to pick them up? Even after all of this I kept trying to go back. I've stopped by the office to reorder contacts but was told they were at lunch, even though it wasn't 12pm yet and wouldn't let me order, I left several messages, and no one has called me back.  Finally today I scheduled an appointment with another office in town and if the initial call is any indication, I am going to be very happy with that office.</text>

It's been 7 months and the issue with glasses hasn't gotten resolved. I'm a new patient to this center. I didn't expect to get the best service, but I sure did not expect to receive the worst either. I spent so much money in this facility like I never have before, but just to come out with a worthless pair of prescription glasses that I can't return. I was told twice that I will get a call to get an update on my request to resolve the issue, it's been a month and no call yet. They never answer their calls and never return any of my messages either. They are not closed they are open during this pandemic. I tried to call again today, no answer again. I have a very expensive pair of prescription glasses that I can't return sitting in my purse that I'm not able to use. I'm not happy at all with this place. I'll see if I can get this resolved, maybe then I can upgrade my review. Very disappointing experience.< /text>

I’ve been to this office a total of five times and every time I am disappointed. The lack of professionalism and total disregard for the customer is appalling. I don’t write many reviews because I always give businesses the benefit of the doubt. Like “what if they are just having a bad day?” We all have those. But I’ve come to realize that this a fundamental problem that the staff has acquired. By writing this review I hope that a person who truly cares for the company will take action and instill in these people what it means to have a good customer service. I wish all the best to the business and hope this review will help them grow — because if they don’t I am certain they will fail in keeping new and past customers satisfied.< /text>

< Review>
I have been going to this place since kindergarten. Absolutely love the doctors but man oh man is their office people really making this a bad business. Last year was the first year I had a problem. They forgot to order my trial lenses. Three months later I had finally gotten them and then another month the scheduled me back so it took me 4 months to get new contacts. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought it was an honest mistake. I really love the doctors so I went back. I had my eye exam in April... still no trial lenses... I called and they said they have no record that I was supposed to get trial lenses. I then told them the whole conversation I not only had with the doctor but with the lady who was supposed to order my trials as well. I paid out of pocket for my glasses because they said the contacts were more expensive and I could use my insurance for one or the other. I spent $300 on the most basic glasses I could get and still have no contacts to even try. I’ve been wearing my last set of contacts for 3 months now and I’m really upset because my glasses prescription is so high it hurts to wear them for too long. I NEED my contacts. They called me back 2 weeks ago and told me they were on backorder. Well I called today to check on them and they’re saying they never ordered them again. I’m just so frustrated. So sad to say but I’m going to have to find a new eye doctor next year and it seems like it’s not even the doctors faults. I gave this 2 stars because I love the doctors so much that I couldn’t give them 1 star.</Review>

<Review>Norma took me in, showed me the lovely frames, helped me find ones that made my eyes pop! She treated me like family and I adore her! All the girls were welcoming and friendly, the medical assistant was knowledgeable and kind, the optometrist's exam was thorough. Every single person, from receptionist booking me last minute, finding my insurance on the website because i couldnt find my card, to the ma, to the optometrist, to the optician was absolute perfection. The office runs like a well oiled machine, and the care for each person in the room was detailed and courteous. Most importantly, you could feel the actual way they each deeply care for every person. They rushedmy glasses because i have an employee physical tomorrow. These people are so wonderful. They really are.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Dr. Fred Stellhorn awesome doctor. My son had a collagen crosslinking surgery for keratoconus on Wednesday afternoon at Delta Eye Center in Tracy and Saturday evening the contact the doctor put in after the surgery went to the side of his eye and it was hurting him so bad he was crying with pain I rushed him to the ER. Kept calling Delta Eye Urgent number all night no answer no call back. ER doctor removed the contact and said to go see the eye doctor in the morning. We walked in this place at 8.30 in the morning,  first time there, explained the situation to the girl at the front desk,  she was very nice. She went and get Dr.Fred and he took my son in and took care of the situation. We thank you Dr. Fred. He cared for him like he care for his own family member. We left very happy and my son was smiling.</Review>

After I get my contacts I WILL NOT BE RETURNING AS A CUSTOMER!!! The office staff is so disrespectful and ignorant. I told them on the phone that I was one the way to pick up my lenses but when I got there 18 mins later the doors were locked and the lights were out. It wasn’t even time to close yet! I called again and left a message and no one returned my calls. Can’t stand people who can’t do their job right!!!</text>

This place is the WORST! They have ZERO customer service and also have no idea which way is up or down!
They are RUDE and seriously need more training and how to  give out proper information, regarding new customers. They need to learn how to treat people better, Can anyone recommend a seminar to these people?
I have never been more confused about making something as simple as an appointment. Every call they contradicted themselves in every way possible. Oh you need this... no you don't need that.... your qualified... no your not qualified...
The front desk supervisor is a waste of time! I have no idea what schooling she went to but she really needs to go back for proper training, especially if she is going to keep a upper position and lead by example.
I have to rate with at least 1 star, but Believe me I have given them ZERO stars! I will let everyone I know NOT to go to this place!< /Review>

<name>bev jeg< /name><text>Been going for years. Dr didnt do a complete eye exam to catch an on going cataract from previous year. Refused to refund my perscription that was not correct because of cataract he did not follow up on. They do not honor their mistakes and make it right. Ins only covers on pair a lenses for the year. This Dr office  expected me to go with out glasses for another year. I called vsp ins and they investigated and agreed the office was wrong in not giving me full refund in order to get new lenses. So vsp has credit me new lenses after having cataract surgery. They expressed their apologies for Dr office not honoring their mistake and was sorry i was treated in such ill manner by the iffuce supervisor. Thus place has lost my business after 14 yrs of service.< /text>< pictures>

I stopped in while on the way to Carrizo National Monument. I spoke with Tina the owner for a while, really nice salt of the earth. She's from not far from where my Mother comes from, we talked about family and the times. The food was really good and too much to finish (I got the Hamburger). The decor is something out of time, with some quirkiness to it. I strongly without reservation recommend going here. To me its a slice of Americana that should be experienced.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIfZT7VdbANlp_VZ0PZgpQk5IevamFja_YXJdd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMio3qbCogniRTC_8G-5mJjj8Uu0li_cV2_OQj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

This place is a must try . If you are ever in the area of Maricopa stop into Tina's Diner. We are working in Bakersfield and took the 45 minute drive to enjoy a taste of Heaven in the best meal I've had in a long time.  Tina takes pride in the food she puts out. If you leave her restaurant hungry you will never fill up. A bowl of soup ,then a salad plate(tossed salad,carrot salad, potato salad, and macaroni salad) then came a chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and a cup of peaches. Can't forget the garlic bread.
The price was very affordable.  6 of us not one dissatisfied person.  Every thing made homemade and with love. My hat off to the great taste of Heaven.  When ever I'm near Tina you won my buisness.<//review>

Very nice lady, great home style food. I really didn't know what to think when I walked in but the experience could be summed up as "Lunch at grandma's house". There is no hurry, but with that sort of atmosphere, who wants to hurry?<//Text>

Wonderful food and owner. Tina made us fresh salads and her Spanish sandwich all were fantastic. She even serenaded us while she cooked. After we ate she share her background and owning the diner for 45 years. We stop again when in the area.<//text>

<Review>Tina's is literally overflowing with character. Not only is the building thoroughly decorated, but Tina herself is an amazingly charismatic woman with tremendous stories of her life. Make sure to ask about how she survived as the 11th kid in a poor family in the Philippines!

The food is homemade and very delicious, with filling portions.

Depending on the season, Tina might just offer you a fresh, hand-picked guava. Take it!

Tina's is the full-spectrum antidote to the excess of chain restaurants and sanitized consumerism that plague our country. In many ways, I felt like I was back in 1910, grabbing a bite after a hard day in the oil fields and chatting with the owner.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>Don't miss out on Tina's extra-special home-made hand-made sausage. Breakfast anytime make Tina's a favorite. I had an omelet. Old Dad had eggs and sausage. Fresh hash browns were crisp and delicious. A great place to eat in Maricopa. It could be the best place in town.< /review>< pics>

Not sure she even owns a can opener.  Locals come by for a bite and conversation.  Like being at a hometown BBQ.  No strangers here.  Loved it!!!!< /review>< Pics>

Wonderfully cozy, very friendly!  Fantastic food; like it was your mom or grandma cooking.  Tina will make it better than you ordered or expected.  If you leave hungry, that is your fault! Excellent value; you will definitely get your money's worth.  Tina will welcome you in and make you feel like family.  This is not a fluke; I have been several times now, and she has always treated me like family.  She will make your food to order, but it will never seem like you have to wait.  "Rated E for Excellent and Everyone."< /review>

<Text>This woman is one of the most wonderful people on this planet, no exaggeration. What little time you are able to spend with her during your visit will impress you but I have had the fortune of knowing her my whole life. Excellent doesn't do her justice, as far as her cooking prowess or her personality. Much Love.</Text>< pics>

<Text>My brother and I went to this diner on our way from California to Texas. The owner was incredibly friendly and warm, and the food was amazing. I had one of the best burgers I have had in a while, and it was dirt cheap in price for what I got (Less than ten bucks for a three-patty-and-cheese burger, with all the fixings).
I would absolutely recommend this place to everyone; the food and service was amazing.</Text>< Pictures>

Met Tina and she really was a pleasure to be around. The food was greatly portioned and was all home cooked.  Even the mashed potatoes were freshly made. I left with plety of leftovers. If you are in the area you HAVE TO try this hidden gem. To see for yourself.  You will not be disappointed.< /Review>

Great food especially during breakfast time, I have classified the portion sizes for the gusher because of tasty reasons. The building is well decorated and has a comfortable atmosphere, Tina talked to us about her family's history and was very nice.<//Review>

Wonderful all-American diner with great food. I was roadtripping across the country, stopped there for more than hour eating and talking with the owner, who told me all the best spots to camp along the Pacific Coast.</text>

< review>
I was just a walk in customer because the drive to nearest town is approx. 10 min away!  As I enter Tinas Diner located in Maricopa,Ca. Was in dismay thinking I was in the wrong place!  No one viable or greeting you! The owner was actually sitting at a corner table and it took me a moment to realize she was not a customer herself!  They did not have anything that was on the menu and she overcharged me for what I received! Too personal too quick! Not good  social bussiness skilled at all! I will not return to diner at any time!  Nice family otherwise!< /review>

<text>Always a "just like home" experience.  Mama T's restaurant offers an experience that will make you feel like you're home for the holidays.  The food is always delicious and the fruit always fresh, and coffe for breakfast is hot and fresh.  What more can I say?  I love good customer service, and Mama T's offers the best in that department, that the food is so good is a plus.  I love Tina's Diner and would not mind sharing Maricopa's best kept secret with those whol love food and good treatment in a relaxed atmosphere.< /text>< userid>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Some years ago my wife and I were riding vintage motorcycles from Los Gatos to our home in Riverside.  Her bike was limited to 50 mph, so we rode back roads all the way, and it was really hot on Hwy 33.  We were ready to drop in the heat when we stopped at Tina's.  Now, this place is the very last biz open in this tiny old town, and we were looking at another 3 or 4 hours to get home.  I took a pic of our two bikes on a totally empty main street.

I am not exaggerating when I say that Tina saved our lives.  We are forever grateful, and my riding buddy and I will stop there this weekend on our way to and from the WSBK races in Monterey.<//text>< pics>

< Review>
Going skydiving came here to eat and spent 1 hour 15 min waiting for my food. People who came in 15 min after us got their food 20 min before us and we were one of 3 tables with people in them. Not worth the wait no matter how much food they give you. .. update just got my food and it was covered in onions when I asked for none.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE< /Review>

<Review>Yesterday I went to my storage it had been sometime since I was there, and
for the first time in all the years I have rented there the place was very well
manicured, clean, just made me feel good.  Mona immediately came out to
meet me to help me. A very hard working, friendly and professional  person.
I felt safer too because of the care on the place someone was taking care.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1611071185849, 'text': 'Christine thank you for such kind words we appreciate a 5 star review...but most of all we appreciate having you as a customer!'}< /Resp><GmapID>0x809072b05a08bcb3:0x4aa8e0251435e979< /GmapID></record>

Love storing my stuff here. It is secure, management is friendly and so kind. One time my husband left his phone on the back of his truck and it ended up in the road. The lady went the extra effort and got the cell phone back in my husband's hand. She even stayed over her time by a half hour or more to make sure we received the phone personally.
I recommend Waterloo Road Storage to everyone. Pay your rent on time and have no troubles.< /text>

The office lady is a idiot. She took us to the wrong unit to begin with. I had to tell her that it was the wrong size because she didn't realize it. Then she made us wait while she went back to the office to get the correct number to a unit of the correct size. Then it wasn't even empty. This lady shouldn't be a manager in my opinion. So unorganized.< /text>

I was looking for a affordable storage space for my daughter.  The lady was very helpful and the space was clean.  Price was very affordable for our budget.  I would definitely recommend this place and if in need I would used your service again.</Text>

I really love this place a lot i also love dirandra she is awesome and does a great job she is always working and is always polite to her customers. The other lady is rude and is always in her room and never comes out when we have questions she is rude to you. She never wants to answer you nor does she want to help you. I only come in to deal with dirandra . Who ever the owner is really needs to recognize  who works and does not.</review>

Sorry I can't remember the lady's name who helped us over the phone. She was professional and helpful, when we arrived to see storage spaces she was helpful in assisting us in selecting the right storage space for our needs. I highly recommed this safe and secure facility.<//text>

I have dealt with afew different storage facilities and i really like Waterloo Road Storage the best. The people are friendly and helpful. The grounds are kept clean. The managers drive by in their cart to check on everyone make sure your alright sometimes they ask if you need help. The storage units are nice, alot of sizes and very reasonably priced.</Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>This storage facility has new owners and they are really doing a badddddd job at it. They close earlier now and gate access is now closed on holidays . We use to go there on holidays now we can't . Rent was due on the first and you had a 10 day grace period to pay or get a late fee. Well now it's still due on the 1st and if it's not paid on the first they lock you out now on the second day. If you are late getting out of the gate past 7  they charge $100.00 old owners charged $5. No smoking outside anymore. No big deal on that one. Too many changes all at once. People are not happy. Couldnt wait to find another storage place and leave that place. We now rent from  A&A mini storage in Lodi now. Wonderful place.Waterloo  not a well run place at all. We have been there a few years. Thus us the 3rd set of owners so far and the worst by far . They need a little customer service training.  Horrible place . That also has cocroaches in their units. So beware if you Want to rent here.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<Review>10/10 ambiance, the food was really good. Cute restaurant almost hidden by the vines and plants in the wall. Felt like we weren’t in LA, which was nice.<//Review>< UserId.>

< Review>
Great restaurant!!! I loved the ambience. I was greeted at the door by the owner, the wait staff were pleasant and fast. The food was exceptional!! I tried the Rigatoni Carbonara which was fantastic. Better than what I experienced in Rome!!! I will definitely visit Adagio again!!!<//Review>

Walked in on and Friday night at 5:45pm and it was pretty full. The manager squeezed us in and we had an AMAZING meal. My boyfriend is very picky about his Italian food. I've only been to one other place with him that was acceptable. We came on a recommendation from another couple we met on the street. They raved about this place. So of course, we had to try it out.... and it did not disappoint. Portions are a nice size. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Cant wait to go again and again! So happy I found this local gem.< /review>

Wonderful seafood and loved eating outside.  Very good service and they say the chippano is the best in town.  I loved it and my husband who doesn't like seafood loved it too.  I guarantee you will love it!  Then go around the corner and have a nice dessert at Stella's.</review>

Have been going for 20 plus years. Claudio is an outstanding host and his staff is wonderful. Always a lovely consistent well prepared and delicious meal. They never disappoint- always bring my out of town guests and they are always nothing but thrilled with the meal. Especially my NY clan</review>

<Review>Quaint little Italian restaurant.  The owner greets everyine that comes through the door. Limited bar but decent drinks.

The pre meal arancini balls, even though they dont seemed to be filled with cheese, and the sliced bread with mushroom sauce are delicious.

The pasta with chipped clams was very good. The white wine sauce was perfect and having bread to wipe the plate clean is a must. The chicken of the chicken parmesan was crisp and juicy. The only down side were the side vegetables were hard and bland. They should somehow yes the white wine sauce from the pasta dish in the vegetables.

Overall a nice restaurant with good food that won't break the bank.< /Review><date>1505752255104</date>< rate>

<Review>Excellent Food.  Owner is very nice.  Love the Stracciatella Soup, Bolognese is also very good.  I had the special about a week ago - Pasta with  Various Seafood and a tomato sauce which was Fantastic.  My only wish is that the Restaurant had Meatballs and Sausage.  I think every Italian restaurant should have these Items.  Still an Excellent choice for Italian.  I  am Italian too so having my Moms Food  growing up was very similar to this place!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Hidden gem! A happy accident stumbling upon this incredible place for my birthday. We parked right next to the entrance planning to go to a different restaurant nearby but noticed the happy patrons walking out so we peeked in to check it out and the incredible smell of the food lured us in. We ordered a number of different pastas - the arrabiata was insane! The Caesar salad was also the best we've ever had! Incredibly friendly staff - can't say enough good things about it! absolutely loved it!</Review>

<Text>Really jammed on a Saturday night , but nothing special and one of the couples we were with didn't really care for their chicken parmesan. My salmon was done medium rare as I requested. My husband enjoyed his chicken over thin slices of eggplant.  All 3 couples split Cesar salads.</Text><rate>2<//rate></record>

The best food in Woodland hills. Went here for the first time. I was impressed. It was my bday we ordered way too much but got to taste quite a bit. My fave was the pasta with meat sauce. (Forgot the name). Best best best. The ceaser salad made table side was also the best.  The Asparagus soup without dairy was on point. The branzino was amazing. The prices were very fair!  Best birthday dinner.</review>

very attentive staff. friendly with good service. food is good. The osso bucco hubby had was great. I had fish and it was not really good. So stick with their specials and you will be fine. Ambiance is a bit dated but its an affordable nice place to go when you don't want to be in a crowd. really good for group dinners.< /text>

Without a doubt the best italian food in the valley.  Before you've even been given a menu you have apps at your table and bar order taken care of.  Old school italian hospitality nothing compares to Adagio!<//review>

(Translated by Google) The service and the food are incredibly good!

I can only recommend eating here once.

Very nice updated restaurant on the inside. Looks clean and elegant. The  cheese wonton appetizers are very delicious! Walnut shrimp meal was also amazing. Big portions and combo comes with fried rice, chow mein, and an egg roll. Wasn’t expecting the food to be that good but turned out amazing! Gonna be definitely coming back here again.</Review>

Yesterday was the first time we went to this fine restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last time. We enjoyed the evening very much with the efficient service, with the finest  meal and wine and with the decent payment. We will no doubt go back there in a short time.</review>

This place is a local favorite and rightfully so! The restaurant staff treat all of us like a family and create a nice environment for locals to dine-in (pre-covid). The food is delicious and fresh, every.single.time! We love to eat here and dine-out because of the delicious menu items and the warm environment they give off for customers.< /Review>

The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the staff is always very friendly. They serve all of the usual dishes one might associate with similar places around town. I usually order the walnut shrimp with the house fried rice and the cream cheese wontons. The quality is consistent and the service is fast.  They have lunch and dinner specials for groups and individuals, and takeout is available. I'm not sure if they've hooked up with any delivery services yet, but not as far as I'm aware.< /Review>

We've eaten here a handful of times since Elaine and family took over. The food is amazing! Love the General Chicken, the Eggplant and especially the Salt & Pepper String Beans. I really, really hope they stay in Rio Linda for a long time, great people doing great things!</text>

<Date>1560898284571</Date><rate>1< /rate><Text>Good food. My mother has to be hospitalized if she eats peas or lentils and we specifically asked the waitress if one of the dishes had peas she said no. We received the plate of food full of peas. We explained to the waitress the problem that my mother's throat swells up and she has to go to the hospital and may potentially die if she has an allergic reaction. She apologized and said she will make a fresh one with no peas. She returned with a plate of food that still contains peas they had simply picked out the peas and try to serve it to someone who is deathly allergic to peas absolutely ridiculous. I personally believe that the health department should shut this place down until they can hire staff that has gone through proper training and is able to communicate in English.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x809b280fa36088a5:0xbe775363c71c1896</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great food hidden in Rio Linda! Staff was more than helpful with quick service. Got two take outs to eat at home after a long day at work and opened one up to take a quick bite because it was the first time I've eaten here and ended up eating both of them in the parking lot lol. Well worth the weird looks by passerbys.< /review>

I ordered a vegetarian dish and the dish had eggs in it. I explained to the server that I don't eat eggs since I am a vegan. I also offered to pay for the replacement dish. Not a problem.  My dish was replaced with a smile. No extra charge. Will definitely visit again.</Text>

This is a pretty good place to sit down and have a nice Chinese dinner at a decent price where you can feed the family. You can also order it for takeout. The staff is friendly the service is relatively fast and the food is delicious! I recommend you at least try it if you're looking for some Chinese food in the Rio Linda area</Review>

My family and friends have been eating here for years. The price is right, and the food is amazing. The family that runs the business is ultra friendly, and even when busy they manage to provide excellent customer service and are definitely decent about portions and speed of service. This place is great for family or group events.< /review>

Typical Chinese food place. Their cream cheese wontons are great. Service is quick. Some of the employees are a little rude, but we make sure we are always served by the same friendly lady. Has become one of our favorite places to eat in town.<//Review>

Horrible service. No thank you. No hello. Nothing. I can accept mediocre service but this was the worst.

Here for lunch. Soup tastes like it came out of a can. Ordered a soda that was warm.

No spring roll on my plate. Chow Fun is heavily soaked in grease.

Stay away from this dump!!!< /Text>

<review>Sergio and Manny did an awesome job with the installation of my sola-lite roof fan.  Sergio was on time and did great work, everything looks great.  Manny was excellent in helping preparing the bid and evaluating what needed to be done.  The Sola-Lite fan unit is already cooling my garage and I couldn't be happier.  5 stars all the way!!!<//review>< Time>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I am sooo happy with this whole experience, process, results, everything!! Vivian in office helped me along the whole way because there were lots of moving parts to getting this done. The installer James was super nice and extremely knowledgeable and helped me find the perfect spots to get the max light out of the couple we were installing. The difference now is just wow!! My once dark home didn't get much light but now it's like a whole new world! We get light early in the AM and throughout the whole day! My family is wowed everyday we walk or are just sitting and enjoying the room. The process was so easy and quick, only took a couple of hours. He was clean and mindful with the area. Even helped me determine a couple more winning spots!! Also looking into the dimmer set for the bedroom btw.
I just can't stop thinking, what a difference!!
With all the benefits, HIGHLY recommended.</Review>< Pics>

We had Sola-lite come and assess our lighting needs. We thought we needed a skylight, costing five orr six thousand dollars. Instead, we got five sola-lites installed at various spots in the house at a cost of less than four. The work was clean, efficient, and they were in and out in one day. The installer was friendly, communicative and considerate. We are delighted with the result and recommend them highly.</text>

We LOVE our Solar Tube! It adds so much beautiful light to our dark hallways - we've had one in both the homes we've owned in the last 5 years. We're always recommending them to our neighbors and friends - it makes such a difference with the natural light. Their team is very helpful and responsive; I've loved working with them.<//review>

< Review>
My wife and I have always had an issue with how dark our kitchen was. After almost a year of going back and forth trying to decide whether to install a SOLA-LITE in our Indio home, we contacted Vivian at the Palm Desert office. She was extremely courteous and incredibly knowledgeable about the product. When arrangements were made for James, the technician who was assigned to install our unit, we specifically requested that COVID-19 protocol be followed. James did exactly as we expected. In addition, he was also on time, very attentive, experienced, and the quality of his work was superb. Not only does our unit look like amazing, but the amount of light that reflects through the skylight is incredible. Since we had or SOLA-LITE installed, we hardly turn our kitchen lights on during the day. This fact alone tells me this unit will definitely pay for itself in a matter of a few months. I recommend SOLA-LITE to all Coachella Valley residents who are in desperate need of brighten their home.< /Review>

Excellent customer service and professional installation, we’ve had three (Solar-tubes)  installed, two in bathrooms with no windows. We had them installed over the shower/bathtub what a difference It made.
We’re very happy and highly recommend this product and company.< /Review>

Outstanding company to work with, very responsive, prompt on installation day, very clean & courteous, and I am VERY VERY VERY happy with the results.  I had this installed in one of my bathrooms, which used to be rather dark and depressing, and now it is light and bright and very cheerful!  I cannot recommend this product or this company enough, Sergio did the installation and was amazing!!</Review>

<text>Our old skylight had developed some cracks, so we ordered a replacement from Solalite. They installed a beautiful replacement. The installer complained that the old skylight was not properly waterproofed and removed the old waterproofing (which had been effective, no leaks). He then plopped the new skylight in and told us to call a roofer to waterproof the skylight and left. I called Solalite to complain and was told that that didn’t sound right and she would get back to me. She never called back and when I called, I was put on hold and forgotten. No roofer wants my tiny job, one said their work would be a $2500 minimum or they didn’t want the job. I am left with a beautiful but leaky skylight. Thanks so much Solalite!
In retrospect, I should have called a third time or at least until I talked with some one who knew what was going on. My bad review reopened communication between Solalite and me. Almost immediately after posting my bad review, the owner called me and said he knew what was wrong and wanted to make it right. He came to my house and fixed the issue that had stumped the original installer.  Solalite knows what they are doing, I am the customer who fell between the cracks, once we started talking everything was fixed to my satisfaction and I hope Solalite’s. The people at Solalite are always friendly, on time, knowledgeable, and professional. If you are thinking about getting a skylight or replacing one, call Solalite they are the Best!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1602264651539, 'text': "Hi Barbara, I'm sorry for any confusion: your skylight is still waterproof!

Overall I couldn't be happier! The installer, James, was the best. He was meticulous, careful, an absolute professional. He explained everything in detail. While removing roof tiles he noticed that there was a tear in our tar paper that could cause a leak and he fixed it, N/C. He even took pictures of the problem and his work in the attic.
Three solar lights later, and our house is amazingly bright!<//text>

<review>Thank you Sergio for making my day. You improved the entry way 100% and relieved the worry of access to furnace. I also love that I have night lights as well. But I’m most grateful for you staying calm and respectful when I was a bear after yet another set back with construction that you had nothing to do with. What a great family referral!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Sola-Lite was an exceptional vendor for us. They were very flexible with the demands of the HOA rules. Vivian was very helpful in switching installation dates and getting the paperwork out.

The installer Sergio was very accommodating also. He was able to switch out the larger size we ordered for a smaller tube when space  demands precluded the larger size.

I keep wanting to turn off the light provided because I think I'm burning electricity. The solar tubes are just beyond what I thought they would be.</Text>

<review>I couldn’t be happier with my 6 new Velux replacement Skylights.

My HOA was reroofing and I was only given a seven day notice to have any work done on my Skylights.  Vivian answered the phone at Sola-Lite and Sergio came out the same day to measure my skylights and take pictures – – so Matt could prepare an estimate that afternoon. The estimate was very fair and I immediately placed the order.

Prior to my new replacement skylights arriving in their office, there was a leak in one of my existing plastic dome skylights during the recent rains. I texted Sergio and he was here in 30 minutes and made a repair. Three days later we had another storm and I had another leak in my old skylights. I texted Sergio and an hour later he arrived with the new skylights and installed them to Beat the next storm and to meet the HOA deadline to have the work done.

I can’t think of a way That the experience could’ve been better. Totally satisfied! Above and beyond service!<//review><Resp>{'time': 1591718787262, 'text': 'Thank you, Larry!

<Review>My wife and I recently moved to the area and decided we needed some additional light in one of our rooms.  After doing a fair amount of research, we decided to install a SOLA--LITE. We contacted the office in Palm Desert and I have to say, we couldn't be happier with both the product and the people at SOLA-LITE. Everyone was very helpful. They took the time explain the different products which helped us make our final decision. The installation went smoothly and was completed on time. I would highly recommend this company!!!</Review>< UserId.>

<Text>As a professional in the contracting & design industry, I have been recommending Sola Lite to my clients for years, always hearing positive feedback. Recently having one installed in my own home, I can honestly say I couldn't be happier. They were so knowledgeable on where to place my tube for optimal lighting, they were on time and the installer was very professional. The outcome was exactly what I had hoped for and more.</Text>< pictures>

Want to thank our installer James for a truly professional job on installing our three Sola tubes today.  He arrived on time, made a point of covering the floors prior to installation and made sure everything was clean before leaving.  What a tremendous improvement in our home with the Sola tubes.  We will use them again for additional tubes.<//Review>

<review>Our kitchen is in an interior portion of our house and was dark during the day requiring us to keep the lights on in order to see properly. Now with our Sola-Lite Tube installed, we have natural daylight all day long. It has made a significant difference.

Wonderful way to bring light into your home.  When I leave a room I try to turn the light off only to realize it's the solar tube, not a light.< /Review>

<text>What an amazing transformation!  Our laundry and the hallway leading to it were always so dark that we had to turn the lights on, even in the middle of the day, but now with the Sola Tube installed, it is brightly lit during the day and the soft glow of the internal solar powered night light gives just the right amount of light to those areas during the night.  From beginning to end, the service we received from Sola-Lite was perfect.  The sales team is friendly and responsive and the installation took place as scheduled and was very quick and efficient.  For pulling energy saving sunlight into a home, Sola Tube is a great solution at the right price and Sola-Lite is the right team to get the job done.  I highly recommend them.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Listened to my questions and answered honestly, I believe. Auto had dents and scratches from being sideswiped in a parking lot. They were fixed, and the car was repainted the original manufacturer's color. Looks brand new. After care was explained in detail. Pleased with the total service.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Got a call on Thursday that it was ready.  Looks beautiful.  can not get a decent picture and the paint just shows bright and clear and reflect the clouds and trees.  Very Very impressed.

Too expensive for what they offer and their warranties don't equate to what you'll pay for when all is said and done. There are definitely mom and pop shops that will offer more for less. You just have to do your due diligence.<//Review>

I brought an aftermarket front bumper in to paint and I was nervous at first because of the material of the bumper and paint match since my car is pretty old. Karla took great care of me with very reasonable pricing/knowledge compared to other places that quoted me. Process was quick and so far, I love the finished product. It also includes a 3 year warranty if the paint goes bad for whatever reason. They gave me confidence in their services/product. Thanks again!< /review>

<text>They performed an outstanding job on my daughter's car. Zulema, gave me a good deal and explained in great detail everything that was going to be done to the car. They even replaced the damaged side view mirror on the car at a minimal cost.

Currently, they are working on my Toyota Tacoma and I know they will do a great job. They also painted my Jeep Wrangler three years ago and the paint is still looking good and I opted for the $499 paint job. I thought the paint was not going to last but it looks great so far.

So far, my experience with them has been excellent and my rating for them is a definitely a five-star.</text>< gmap_id>

I had my truck repainted due to paint peeling and discoloration from first paint by Maaco. Was quoted one week took three weeks. Without calls from Maaco letting me know the status. I had to call to be updated.

A lot of orange peel, several runs in paint, a lot of dirt specks in paint, poor service, Poor communication. Also, was not pleased to see the workers moving my truck without a mask or gloves during Covid

The only thing I appreciated were the texts of photos of the job when asked and the time the supervisor took to listen to my disappointment.</review>

The vans are important to our business and couldn’t go one day without them. We took them in on the Friday before thanksgiving because the kids were out of school, and needed them the Monday after thanksgiving. That was eleven days, they knew we had to have those vans on time. We had many call to make sure they would be ready. We have 28 kids that needed to get to school, yet they were not ready till Wednesday afternoon 13 days later. I’m sure they were lying from the beginning.

My car looks Great after the repairs. I received an estimate on March 11 and went to have the work done on April 8. I was advised by Kevin Velazquez to wait one week so I could get my car back in 3-4 days. So  I returned on April 15 to have the repairs done & I was told by Richard Lee that the repairs are taking 7-9 days now. I told him that Kevin told me 3-4 days and he said, " I'll see if I can work you in" He made it sound as if he was doing me a favor. I wasn't thrilled with this because I had previously made arrangements  that said otherwise.</Text>

< review>
Unfortunately my experience with Maaco was very disappointing. I dropped off my vehicle on 5/9. I went to the shop a couple of weeks later and discovered that the paint small blemishes on the driver side door. I also discovered that the latches to the rear window ( Jeep Wrangler) and the frame had not been painted. I was told by employee Kevin that the the corrections would be made. I didn’t receive a callback on the status and eventually Kevin and I was told that the manager did not approve the correction on the left door. I drove to the shop on 6/21and found my vehicle in the parking lot collecting dust. The shop manager ( Asian male ) was immediately very argumentative and said that the blemishes were a result of pre existing body work.  I told him that it can also be dust contamination in the spray booth. He said he was 100% sure that it wasn’t. When I pointed out additional blemishes on the rear window frame that was not painted initially, he told me that it was dust contamination and it’s expected when painting a car. I asked him to correct the door as a professional courtesy and he repeatedly replied , “ why should I fix something that I didn’t do”. I paid for the two stage paint $1500.00 and was expecting a decent paint job. The corrections that I requested are not unreasonable. I’m sure that This manager has cost your company a lot of income due to his unprofessional treatment of customers. I will not patronage this business again and will discourage family and friends from doing business with this company.< /review>

< Review>
I brought my car here to be painted. They completely got the color wrong. Th3 car was gold and they ended up painting or a putrid brown grey.  They tried to say "oh its a 60% color match". I don't think I look that stupid. Gold is gold, not brown grey. They offered to repaint but I don't trust them. Plus, somehow the repaint offer was 30 days later, that when they did the first paint job right away.
Shady. Shady business practice.<//Review>

Joe was extremely rude to me on the phone. Wouldnt let me speak, kept rushing me from the moment he answered the phone. Terrible customer service skills!!! Services felt over priced. The 2 sales guys who gave me an estimate and the one who officially wrote my order up were helpful and professional.< /text>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>Kevin overcharged me for labor costs initially. I feel this is a training issue, and have no ill will toward him. Richard found the error of overcharging 1.5 hours of labor. We verbally agreed over the phone that I would "probably" recieve an e-mail within 48 hours confirming the refund. Richard followed company policy, and I have no problem with him. Frank (the owner) never got back to me with any kind of answer, so my problem is with him. I contacted Debra at your customer service phone number, and recieved quality service from her. I agreed with Richard verbally for a reimbursement of $75.00 over the phone because 1.4 hours is the "average" amount of time it takes for the labor being performed. The actual time it took was 45 minutes, but I was willing to meet him/Maaco half way on this point. After all of the hoops I jumped through, I was hoping for $107.50 of refund, the actual difference of of time vs. cost. I got a check in the mail today for $75.00. The overall experience was below my expectation, and I have yet to decide if I will use my social media, word of mouth option to point this out. I would still like to see the remainig $32.50 check in the mail. Please advise. Christine Sherman<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

I took my 2007 highlander because the clear coat was peeling off. I opted for the best paint job they offered with the 5 year warranty. They didn't match the paint to the paint code on the door. I noticed after 5 months the clear coat started to peel away. I went back I was told it was a warranty issue and would have to contact corporate.  I took it to another Macco dealer presented my receipt and explained what had happened. To my surprise the manager there informed me I was sold the least expensive paint job. Furious I called corporate and spoke with a Mekita Wright well she was no help at all as a customer service provider she was useless. It's been 6 months and still the issue hasn't been resolved. I finally decided to post this as I am considering a class action against them for poor workmanship  and falsely selling me a product. Hopefully this issue will be resolved soon of not I will repost with information about a class action.< /Text>

The staff here at Maaco were extremely helpful and did a great job painting and repairing my car.

I specifically interacted with William. He was super professional and was helpful in deciding from different paint/repair jobs I could get done.

My car was finished in a timely matter and ready for pick up when they said it would be. The paint job looks great and you can barely tell that it wasn’t done at the factory. I have no issues with overspray or miscoloration

I would/have recommend this shop to friends and family for paint and bodywork repair.<//review>

< Review>
Manager Jesús had been great for the past 3 years when using MACCO. Then things changed. Since he knew I was a regular customer, my cars started to be put on the back burner and helping NEW CUSTOMERS first. My cars would stay untouched for 2 months at a time. I had 5 vehicles there. Finally took them out. 2 unfinished. When I picked up my last car, manager had employee block in tow truck until I paid him inside. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL! I was with a client when this happened. Client asked, had you not paid this place before? Made me look like a person that would steal. UNREAL that he would do that after all the work and years I gave & brought him business. I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH MACCO AGAIN!</Review>

Idk if these other reviews are fake or the bad ones are deleted but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone
Very bad
The only good experience I had was the dude up front Wich his name was Kevin and some other dude they were really cool and respectful other than that
They told me my car would be done in 3 to 5 days..more like two weeks for my car to be done
So I finally got the car back after two weeks and the paint job was just horrible
Completely half assed, lazy ass workers
1. Not sanded
2. No primer
3. Got over spray on my exhaust and wheels
4. Paint was bubbling
5. Paint chipped off the right hand door lock
Etc
Manager was rude
Just a very bad place
I wouldn't recommend it to anyone< /review>

It is gamble to take your car to this place, pour customer skill, bad paint job, convenient ripoff for the owner to charge you but not to do the job they promise . It is better to take spray paint the car your self probably you would do the same job they do.
They upsale the advertising when you are there, convence you to higher paint job.< /text>

I love Paul Mitchell Academy. The students have a great training class. By the time they get to the "floor" to help clients, they are very knowledgeable and professional. They take their time with you and listen and follow any directions you might give them. It's always sad for me, but happy for them, when they graduate. I always ask for a recommendation as to who to book an appointment with next when they are graduating. I love Paul Mitchell hair products as well. I've been going there for years and will continue in the years to come!</review>

Paul Michell has a lovely school for both training and servicing clients. I take my elderly Mom there and they are so very sweet and kind to her.  She really enjoys going to Paul Michell.  The location is perfect for us.  It is very very nice.  It is also very clean.  All the people there enjoy being there and it shows with the services they provide.<//text>

<Review>I love going to the Paul Mitchell School.  I get my hair colored and cut - the students are always happy to create a new look and I feel confident the teachers are always available for questions and comments.  I love the quality of any hair style I leave with.<//Review>< Date>

I have been a client at Paul Mitchell The School Costa Mesa for many years.  I always enjoy getting my hair colored and receiving scalp treatments during the summer and winter months.  The pricing is reasonable and students receive supervision from experienced hair colorists and stylists.</Review>

<review>Unfortunately, this is the first time I have had a really bad experience at Paul Mitchell. The student put the wrong color on my roots. When I checked with her about what color it was, she had simply guessed instead of asking me or looking at my chart. From there, she showed herself to be someone who did not have the customer's interest at heart (in my opinion).
I rarely eat anything at Paul Mitchel, but this time I needed to eat something to keep sugar levels in check. The student unnecessarily (in my opinion) ran to "tell on me" and then came back and told me I would not be able to finish the snack.
If this is a rule that has changed with Paul Mitchel, then communication is needed so that people can plan for the change. I noticed a review recently of a mom who brought her son because she needed to and because it was always okay before. She had to walk out of her appointment because no one at Paul Mitchell thought it prudent to tell customers ahead of time about this important change.
I have been at the PM in Costa Mesa for years and for the most part I have been pretty happy. Recently, they seem to be changing and not for the benefit of the people who come for services. I have come here out of habit and because I was generally receiving good service, but I am reconsidering this now. I think maybe a regular salon is in order again.
It would have been easy when making the appointment, for the receptionist to point out important changes in rules/policy.
I also do not see why eating a snack during a long, long, long visit is a problem. The salon sometimes take 4 hours or more for the student to perform tasks that take less than 2 hours at a professional salon. I am willing to endure--I want the students to learn and they are usually quite a wonderful, eager group.
This is the first time ever that I did not leave a generous tip.< /review><time>1569692510765<//time>< user>

I like coming here to get my cuts. You get to spend a little more time with your stylist as they learn to cut your hair. Expect to spend about 45 minutes simply because the instructor has to come sign off on the work. If you come here for a professional stylist you need to remember this a school. Don’t be angry at the students. If they mess up let them know and they will fix it. We all start somewhere, so just keep that in mind.< /Text>

<text>I love getting my hair cut with students who are in the learning phase and especially eager to give my curly hair the best cut ever!  Supervisors are on the floor offering tips and recommendations throughout the process.  This is one salon that understands what a "dusting" means when I don't want a LOT cut off!<//text><Rate>5<//Rate>< pictures>

< Review>
The manager Caesar is the absolute worst! All the girls that work here are super sweet and professional but this guy had no interpersonal skills and was a moody short man on a power trip. He wouldn’t let any of the employees do their job and according to the staff he always has this issue and throws temper tantrums. I recommend the school and the services but don’t go in when he is working.<//Review>

<Text>I've visited the this Paul Mitchell school several times in the past year. I'm always quite pleased with the results and the price!  I've had a new student each time and they've all been lovely.  The students work closely with their instructors and I've never been disappointed with the results. The instructors have listened and made excellent recommendations when I've had questions.  I would recommend a visit to the school. I have never had a problem making an appointment- even during the holidays.  A+ !< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I heard great news about this place from a friend.  I called and they said they don't do barbering on the weekend.  "Call another time during the week".  Wow.  Is that called customer service?  It's a simple haircut.  Maybe I tip very well !!! But i guess they don't know what it means to be accomodating.<//Text><UserId.>117173246071931133986<//UserId.><pictures>None<//pictures><rating>1<//rating>< Date>

I have long hair but one side of my head is shaved. I went in for an updo. I requested a victory roll, 1940's hair do. Even though I requested something hard and I threw a curve ball at Destiny (with the shaved side), she did an amazing job and I got many compliments at the wedding I went to.</Review>

Absolutely HORRIBLE went in for a ice blonde bolyage walked out with ORANGE chunky highlights that went at the same level up to one inch of my scalp looking like I need a root touch up. Called to rebook for a color fix needing done today because it was my birthday and they said I had to wait for that spacific teacher to approve it (in 4 days!) even though he was off talking to a student not even doing someone's hair the entire time mine was being distroyed. Absolutely unacceptable!!!</Text>

NEVER GET YOUR HAIR DYED AT THIS SCHOOL!! THE TEACHERS, TWICE!!-DIDN'T GIVE ME THE COLOR I ASKED FOR!! Yesterday, I asked for the color brown, after I had my color lifted from black. As a result, my hair was mostly white-yellow and light orange. THEREFORE, all the teacher had to do was turn my hair to brown from this new starting point, BUT INSTEAD, THE TEACHER TURNED MY HAIR ORANGE, WITH YELLOW PATCHES!! WHEN I ASKED FOR BROWN!! Another time, I wanted to go to a little darker brown, and THAT TEACHER TURNED MY HAIR BLACK!! NEVER GET YOUR HAIR DYED AT THIS SCHOOL!! FOR CLEARLY, THE TEACHERS HERE ARE UTTERLY INCOMPETENT WHEN IT COMES TO COLOR !!< /review>

My visit at Paul Mitchell The School in Cosa Mesa was fantastic. My stylist, Danyelle, was very sweet and talented. She made sure she understood what I wanted my hair to look like before she began and made my hair health a priority. She was lovely to talk to. It is rare to find stylists like her in the community who are both personable and talented, so thank you, Paul Mitchell! I look forward to seeing her for my next hair appointment soon!</Text>

I have been going to get my hair done at the School for the past year. They are very professional and friendly, and use excellent products on my hair. I have long, blond hair and need my roots done. The teacher always consults with the student beforehand and monitors their progress throughout. And the students are very well trained. My hair has never looked better! I will continue to use them.</text>

<Review>It is a beautiful cosmetic school with tens of thousands of dollars invested in equipment and products and I was happy to see that they have a specialized barbering school with many young men enrolled in the program. The problem is not the students; I found the students to be energetic, helpful, friendly and they look out for each other. The huge and monumental problem is the instructors who it seemed were not very skilled in their trade or too arrogant. I went in for a chemical procedure and the instructor told the girls working on my hair to do a full when it only needed a re-touch I had to quickly correct that. He, Ceasar, was reading from a book like he had never actually done this type of chemical procedure before. The girls followed his instructors and I was very unhappy with the results. The smoothing process wasn't done long enough and he told them not to do the hairline in the front. I was apalled because I know they are students but teach them to do it the RIGHT way! I would suggest reading the complaints board before visiting this place. Also I was unhappy with how the girl washed my hair and usually at most cosmetic schools they always do a poor job with the hair wash. With curly hair you really have to do it harder. Ugh I won't be back.</Review>< resp>

Sadly to say this school is all about favoritism I attended the school a couple years ago graduated took my test passed the practical and didn't pass the written couple months later I try to take it again but felt like I needed a some practice I called and asked the state board learning leader if she can help me I called multiple times never received any phone calls back I even emailed her on Facebook and nothing when I attended there I would see that they would help out some of the students my experience wasn't the greatest while going I tried so hard drove an hour to and from school everyday the learning leaders only go out of their way to help out student they like which is sad cause now I owe thousands in student loans and aren't even doing what I love to anyone debating whether they should go there if I can do it again I wouldn't</Review>

I won't be returning to the Paul Mitchell School - Costa Mesa. I didn't go in with high expectations because I knew these were students, but I was very disappointed about how inconsiderate they were of my time and feelings. I went in for a trim and highlights, they said they would definitely be able to complete it all in a timely manner. I came in at 6:30pm and left at 10:30pm, 4 hours! I was so exhausted, frustrated, and angry by the time I left. They rushed my haircut too because by 9:45am they hadn't even started the cut. I could have been told that from the beginning! I would have said just a cut please.

Within the first hour all the student had done was part my hair and test 1 strip of hair for color. I know she's learning, but I was hoping the instructor would come to assist her and let her know to be more conscious of time. The whole time she was aware of my frustration and how slow she was going, but she didn't make the effort to ask for help to speed up the process. Instructor knew the situation and didn't assist, many times I saw her sitting in a chair chatting with others. My cut done by the instructor near the end and was rushed, nothing impressive... I just got a trim and bangs. The teasing of the hair was a bit rough... The instructor tried to teach her how to be gentle, but she couldn't grasp it.

No discount either. All the instructor said was "I won't charge you for the extra bowl of dye" and "thank you for your patience". You mean the extra bowl the student didn't need to use, but she used because she doesn't know how to conserve her supplies properly? That isn't my fault at all and not much of a "discount", this should be incorporate into the general cost of the school because obviously learning students will use more supplies, not as the customer's expense. The haircut took 4 hours and was nothing too difficult, but still cost over $60. Would rather pay more to spend less time in the salon and get a better cut & service.

The student was very pleasant and sweet, which is why I won't name her, but I hope she learns to speed up, be aware of the customer's time, and approach others for help.</Text>

Love the services they offer and all of their professional products.   The students do a wonderful job under the supervision of their learning leaders. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a pro look without blowing their beauty budget.<//review>

I won't be returning to the Paul Mitchell School - Costa Mesa. I didn't go in with high expectations because I knew these were students, but I was very disappointed about how inconsiderate they were of my time and feelings. I went in for a trim and highlights, they said they would definitely be able to complete it all in a timely manner. I came in at 6:30pm and left at 10:30pm, 4 hours! I was so exhausted, frustrated, and angry by the time I left. They rushed my haircut too because by 9:45am they hadn't even started the cut. I could have been told that from the beginning! I would have said just a cut please.

Within the first hour all the student had done was part my hair and test 1 strip of hair for color. I know she's learning, but I was hoping the instructor would come to assist her and let her know to be more conscious of time. The whole time she was aware of my frustration and how slow she was going, but she didn't make the effort to ask for help to speed up the process. Instructor knew the situation and didn't assist, many times I saw her sitting in a chair chatting with others. My cut done by the instructor near the end and was rushed, nothing impressive... I just got a trim and bangs. The teasing of the hair was a bit rough... The instructor tried to teach her how to be gentle, but she couldn't grasp it.

No discount either. All the instructor said was "I won't charge you for the extra bowl of dye" and "thank you for your patience". You mean the extra bowl the student didn't need to use, but she used because she doesn't know how to conserve her supplies properly? That isn't my fault at all and not much of a "discount", this should be incorporate into the general cost of the school because obviously learning students will use more supplies, not as the customer's expense. The haircut took 4 hours and was nothing too difficult, but still cost over $60. Would rather pay more to spend less time in the salon and get a better cut & service.

The student was very pleasant and sweet, which is why I won't name her, but I hope she learns to speed up, be aware of the customer's time, and approach others for help.< /review>

<review>I have been a Paul Mitchell client for over 15 years and find the services to be mostly very good. I have had excellent stylists over the years and find it hard to see them graduate and go off to work professionally. The instructors are there to help out if needed, but most students are quite accomplished<//review>< pictures>

I decided to try the school and get a haircut here today. I realise they're all students, but my shave took 1.5 hours and no one came by to check on the student to make sure they're doing a good job or even bother to get a feedback from me. To be honest I was not satisfied with the hair cut or the experience over all.</Review>

Miscommunication led to my haircut being much shorter than I typically prefer, but the student did an excellent job in shaping the cut.  In fact, I requested the student for future services.  Clearer communication of expectations and preferences will eliminate future issues.</review>

<Text>TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!! NEVER GOING BACK!!!!!
I  went there two weeks ago and first they thought i didn't have enough  $$ to pay
.. how rude... just because I'M MEXICAN really !!!

Second... they did all this bad things to my hair... bleach it and I ask them NOT to....did two colors because they thought i couldn't afford to keep up with it....

Love coming to a Paul mitchell school , this location is great they have plenty of free parking and a larger location that feels nice and roomy. It's always a nice and clean facility . I love coming and getting a great cut and style , I always need to prepare myself since it usually takes between 3-4 hrs . From the moment they call you, to the wash, cut, dry and style . Maybe due to the fact that I have long thick hair , I'm sure if I had shorter hair and not as thick hair it might be a shorter time frame . I guess one thing they can work on if they do think of getting a new place ,is maybe consider the size of the bathroom stalls .  They are somewhat small compared to the space of everything else in the building.</Review>

<text>Had a great experience . My first time going there, to get my hair done, Vinnie was my guy , and Megan was his helper , she was very nice as well.... Vinnie,Super nice and knowledgeable with color ." Only thing was we ran out of time to cut my hair. my appointment was at 1 pm ,so I thought we would've had enough time to do my hair  cut... Wasn't really understanding how the procedure works ,when you book an appointment at this school..Fyi.. Maybe they can work on explaining it better when you make the appt..  I also bought some hair products. that Vinnie recommended for my curly hair...   Thank you Vinnie. I will be back to book my next hair color treatment.<//text><Rate>5< /Rate><user>117146998937264890627</user></record>

<rating>5<//rating><review>from a cosmetology student viewpoint:
i started at paul mitchell as a student, and transferred else where (due to commute).
just let this be known by far, out of the other 2 locations in the los angeles/orange county area, i love and breathe this school even though i no longer attend here and very soon graduate school all together. the love, support and everything you get from this location..you won't find anywhere else. i'm not the easiest or hardest person to get along with, just thank you joey, kenda, erica, and the rest of the staff to help me achieve my goals. every staff member, learning leader and so forth always have your best interest even if you don't believe they do, they really do. sometimes they do have human errors (as i like to call them) just we all do.

as a client: please keep in mind, we are students, amateurs and do not, i repeat, do not know what we are doing in the sense to our learning leaders or others who have more experience in this industry...so please keep in mind that you are becoming a live mannequin head for us. that we also do appreciate the trust, the allowance to allow us to mess up. we won't because we have a good support system. just remember to be patient with us. this is a learning environment, not some 5-star salon that works with celebrities.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dcdf60936dd70d:0x5034999688041bea<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

If you are thinking about studying here them you should thing twice they wont do anything to make sure you get the credit you have earned with your hours and will do everything they can to milk more money out of you even though they are already really expensive. They do not really care about their students they just care about what money they can get from their students.< /text>< Time>

Zero stars if I could!!! I literally left crying, they messed up my hair! I came in with long hair, up to my waist and left with my hair super short just a little below my shoulders! When I simply asked for long layers and just half an inch of!! I know I shouldn't have expected much from the students, but common can the instructors atleast be professional and lead by example, by providing good customer service. !!! 😡

I was mostly hurt with the instructor, I believe his name is CESAR. He didn't take my feelings into consideration, or by no means tryed to help me out! He admitted that the girl LAUREN did take a bit more than what she was supposed to. He also said as an excuse that my hair was damaged so they had to take all that off to give me a good haircut!!! THAT WAS NOT WITH MY CONSENT!!!! I was told your hair is going to be at your waistline!!!! He told me and I quote " We can't put your hair back" and If i wanted to continue with the session which was still not complete one side was longer than the other. I asked if he can atleast fix it.. He said No, he said the same girl had to continue my haircut ( the one that messed it up In the first place) i said well can you atleast find someone else that can fix it! He said no!! I was not going to leave with one side shorter than the other, so I had to hold my tears together and let this girl continue! And she just had a nasty look on her face while doing it!! Like if it was my fault or something, when she should be the one apologizing!!

I still had to pay for the messed up haircut!! And I asked if I can atleast get my hair flat  ironed since they messed up!  To see my actual length since my hair is a bit wavy !!! And the instructor again said no it would be extra!! What kind of school is this that teaches their students how not to make a client happy!! Never coming Back!<//review>

my mother, who is 79 yrs old went there yesterday. she had a very new student, my Mother was getting her hair dyed. she asked for Medium brown, well she got light brown roots and black hair... Then the student blew her hair straight, she is an older client. The hair color is the worst I have ever seen. I asked my mom if an instructor looked at her hair, she said no one came by to check on the student. My mother went home with 2 toned hair and blown out mess.. plus she was there for almost 5 hours and it cost her $45.. not a good way to treat a senior..  What a f-ing joke!!!! i had to call the team leader back 4 times, finally got someone on the phone .. This school takes NO accountability for their students!!!! know my Mom has to return and pay for her hair to be fixed!!!!!
Don't Ever Go here , you'll be sorry !!!!  **** not the students fault, all should fall on their leaders !! ***</text>

I never finished due to them never fixing a computer glitch and getting kicked out of my dad's house for "ditching" school. I showed my dad and stepmother the paperwork that was signed by my teachers and when they asked the school about it they said I had only been to school for a week and never showed up according to their system. even my friends tried to say that I had been there all except two days when I was in a car accident which my dad knew about. so now I am paying a student loan for a school that I never finished attending due to a glitch in their system and I can't go back to any school until the loan is paid off. My career ended before it even began and it is going to be so much harder for me in the future because I am spending evrything I can afford to try and pay it off on top of all my other bills!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Everything you would expect from the Paul Mitchell brand. The front desk manager, Brenna, who was an absolute delight, greeted me as I walked in. Brenna walked me through all the services I was getting and was a genius in helping me select product (I'll get to the product in a minute). I was set up with Marc #213, he was on point from the start! I showed him a picture of the look I was going for and he went above and beyond! Marc suggested color blocking for my dark hair to give it dimension. It looks amazing! He was super attentive and the passion he had for the industry blew me away. My choppy layered locks and short fringe were done impeccably; Marc is definitely going places. Before I left I spoke with Brenna regarding product that would achieve my desired look, she recommended Awapuhi Texturing Sea Spray. Holy wow! This product is amazing; it gives you that "I didn't try to look this fabulous" look, while keeping your hair soft and tousled. The sea spray has a "wild ginger" scent that will awaken your senses! Seriously it's right up there with your morning coffee.  The added bonus (I know, there’s more) it came with shampoo for free! The shampoo is so rich you hardly have to use any to get a fantastic creamy lather, and it leaves my hair soft and super manageable.

I will definitely be back and highly recommend giving this place a go! The Paul Mitchell name never disappoints.< /Review><rate>5</rate>< date>

Ehh.. sat there for 3.5 hours for foul work. It turned out super super ashy and she didn't acknowledge that I wanted my hair cut as well. Probably better that they didn't cut it.
I hated my color and I'm glad they didn't cut my hair.

I was rushed in, never saw a mirror until they styled it and felt like an extra.< /Review>

<Review>My relationship started w/PM Costa Mesa August of 2009 - when my esthetician at a local salon went on maternity leave -I was ref to PM-  the instructor supervised the student & wasn't going to let me leave until he saw perfection! I've been going there ever since!  Shortly after my first visit- I  started going to PM for hair color - wash & blow outs & now I'm there every single Friday or Saturday for flat iron work.  I go in with my hair already washed/dry & very wavy - just needing iron work.  I stay w/the same student until they graduate at which point they introduce me to another student to take over - I have a few student names/#'s on my I-phone to ask for both- day & night students- always get a friendly greeting from front desk ladies - self serve coffee station is great.  I don't go there in a hurry - because they are afterall students- instructors also stop by & say hello- Linda, Christy, Chris, Jordan, Taylor & more -  students I have loved getting to know over the years - Tia, Jessie, Megan, Natalie, Edie, & so many more! they take pride in their work & pride in seeing me walk out with smooth-straight beautiful hair thanks to them~ I recommend PM to my friends but all the while reminding them - it's a school! they are students- don't be in a hurry & don't be a Diva! If you want a glass of champagne-fancy surroundings & cut & color in 2 hours or less- then you had best continue to go to a swanky expensive salon. At PM  they call me by my first name when I walk in & now the front desk nicknamed me "pen lady" keeping them stocked up w/pens!
I love you guys one & all - keep up the good work & see ya on Friday! xo  Patty Mason!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Response>None< /Response><review>If it were possible, I'd rate this school a zero. I swear, you find great stylists but incompetent other people who ruin the experience of this school. Alondra was one of the -only- students willing to LEARN how to do a correct rollerset and because she behaved like the true professional she is...she excelled at it each time I allowed her to do that style for me! I also didn't mind the male team leader who was always there...he was pretty nice. On the other hand, when it comes to the majority at the front desk team leaders who don’t listen and pricing, that's another totally different story. I really felt treated professional by the girl who WAS always at the front desk with dreds (I believe that's what she has). She not only knew my name but was always respectful, quick and kind. The problem happened when someone else began to take control of the front desk. Upon my last and final appointment, a young girl told me that my future appointments will be charged double of what I have been paying for months! I also purchased a Groupon and that's what really sent this school downhill. The Groupon clearly indicates that I am getting a deal for paying through them for 1. deep conditioning 2. cut 3. S-T-Y-L-E. Well, lo and behold, the illiterate definition for this school of the term 'style' means...BLOWDRY. I have asked -several- people especially my white & Latina friends if they ever considered a 'style' a blowdry. I asked them especially because their hair does curl a lot just with a blowdryer and brush. Their response was a simple NO and looked at me as if I was crazy. This school charged me the -full- amount for a rollerset and wash all because of THEIR definition of style….smh. The email I received from this school's educational leader Sarah Serbic, was seemingly with remorse but all she did was state she ‘understands how I felt’ while in the -same- response stating that THEIR definition, although different from the entire world is just different and there’s nothing she will do! She also took an unnecessary opportunity to reiterate the prices for me as if I didn’t know them not addressing my concerns about the prices being told to me INCORRECTLY at the front desk and the pricing issue with Groupon because of their wack definition of the term style. So, on top of paying the $15 for Groupon’s cut, deep conditioning and STYLE, I had to pay an EXTRA $15 for what I regularly pay for a wash and rollerset which in all actuality in a logical definition is a style! She knew that I used my first Groupon for myself in which resulted with no issue because that day, all I wanted was a blowdry and wash anyways BUT when it came to my child using her portion of the Groupon, she wanted a rollerset -STYLE-. I Then asked Sarah why they didn’t at least charge me half of $15 considering I should only be paying for the rollerset part and NOT the wash considering when I used my Groupon, I didn’t pay extra for my wash. She ignorantly told me that the $15 for a rollerset of which I have been paying all along for months is solely for the rollerset whether a customer gets their hair washed or not, WHAT!!???<//review>< gmap_id>

The starter kit of product was also high, I later realised they made a huge profit on this also. My teacher, Anastasisa, was HORRIBLE MEAN . RUDE, AND CATTYSHE ACTED AS THOUGH WE WERE CONVICTS OR SOMETHING.I would have quit but I really needed to learn skin care. Every day in this school was a stressful nightmare.The entire class ahead of mine tried to get help from this ABUSIVE SNOTTY teacher but the owner was her best friend and just mocked them.Once the required hours of classroom instuction was completed the teachers just sat around socialising and refused to even answer my questions, just told me that if  I wanted to learn more to just read my book.THIS SCHOOL WAS AWFUL!!!!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<rate>5</rate><text>After 8 years in the military the last thing I thought I would ever want to do was be a cosmetologist.  The giant Paul Mitchell sign however, caught my eye and my eyes must have foreseen the effect that this school would have on my life. I recently graduated from PMTS Costa Mesa with full honors (Deans List and Beacon Winner) and am already licensed and working at Gods and Heros in Costa Mesa!!!  There is absolutely no exaggeration when I say that this past year in school has changed my life. I have learned more than I have ever learned before but not just about hair; Going to this school helped me better understand who I am as a person; my strengths, my flaws and my passion and drive have never been stronger. While receiving my education I was extremely involved in all of the school programs resulting in some amazing experiences. To name a few, The US Open, being a hair model at the ISSE Long Beach Convention, working with Misty May, numerous fashion shows and the most influential thing of all was my paid trip to Vegas for Beacon and NAHA.  The learning leaders (instructors) are rock stars among the industry and up to date with all the latest techniques.  I could only hope to be as inspirational as my instructors were for me, always mentoring me, pushing me to my full potential and genuinely caring about me and my education.   You will be amazed at the opportunities that this school has to offer!!! If you want to be a rock star hair stylist, get the best education, make a world of new friends and work hard to open doors you never thought imaginable than this is the school for you.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I would give "0" stars if I could.  I would advise everyone RUN 👣 DON'T walk.  The staff are very RUDE and unprofessional.  I signed up on the walk in list.  I was told all appointments are given 15 minutes, if after 15 minutes the guest doesn't arrive, the appointment would go to the next person on the walk in list.  The appointments started at 1pm. I arrived at 1:15 as asked. I inquired as to whether or not any of the 1pm appointments hadn't showed up, I was told there were a few appointments that hadn't arrived.  I specifically asked if that meant I would get the next appointment, I was told yes, and asked to have a seat to be called up shortly.  I waited and after about 30 minutes I was told they were not going to be able to see me??? They were very unconcerned and not sympathetic they I waited all that time!!! I asked to speak to a manager who too was nonchalant. I will not give business to ANYONE who treats patrons in this manner! Go someplace where you will be valuedoing and treated with redirect, because this isn't the place!< /Text>

<Review>The staff is very rude with no respect for their customers.  Avoid this place if you can help it.   The staff doesn't deserve support if they won't even let people with babies sit down while they wait their turn.   They've limited their capacity to the number of sales people they have  in the store so it takes forever to be seen even with the store 90% empty.  So even if you don't need their slimy salesmen, they make you deal with one tailgating you the whole time.  This has nothing to do with covid but only to do with them forcing you to deal with their sales people.  Its a joke.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dce7e1f4636cfb:0x976cf69dde2484ae<//Gmap_id></record>

<review>Long wait and be ready to be skipped if you are not white.  Horrible experience.  Manager (Erica Lynn) needs to be retrained on customer service.  Sadly if this represents Furgerson in Irvine.< /review><GmapID>0x80dce7e1f4636cfb:0x976cf69dde2484ae<//GmapID><Name>Eloy Luna<//Name><rating>1</rating><user>116013930718227091579<//user></record>

<review>My mom asked them what products she should get as she was being indecisive. Immediately got yelled by their sales person for being indecisive and got told to not was their time. She is an amateur and needed guidance and she cried after that incident. There is no exaggeration, this is the first time any salesperson has elicited this type of interaction with us. Many competitors in the area, please go somewhere else.<//review>< gmapID>

<Time>1547944451050<//Time><text>Showroom is very large and has a very wide variety of options for bathroom and kitchen. Even a few items for the outdoor BBQ.

Friendly and attentive staff who address you by name.

We worked with Monique to decide and order our master bathroom components - she's a consummate professional and has a great eye for design. Talked/showed us through many options and gave insight into the pros and cons of each option.
After having worked with a few designers on this project, we are exceptionally happy we landed with Ferguson and Monique. Highly recommended.</text><UserId.>110194271732631238176</UserId.>< gmap_id>

<resp>None</resp><Review>I had to go into the store twice. The first time, I was overwhelmed and had no clue where to start. I needed parts for a shower (head, valve, etc) the staff member that helped me was wonderful (I regret I forget her name). I told her a general idea of what I wanted and she was able to find me everything and I had a 3 day deadline for delivery so she made sure it was shipped overnight. The second time it took a bit longer to get help, but then she walked in again and we were helped. This time she found us a sink and had it delivered within two days. We told her upfront out deadlines and she used that to help search for products. They were more expensive on some items, but okay in others. I would definitely recommend them, she was knowledgeable, patient, helpful, and friendly.
Only advice is to make sure to check comparable pricing for some items.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I just tell her what style I like, and she will find the right product for me. They carry a lot brands and different products. For most products they can do second day deliver to your home. They also match the home depot price. I would definitely recommend this place.<//Review>< pics>

Customer service is amazing. We had a problem with a fixture we purchased and our representative, Haley, resolved the issue immediately without any complications. They stand behind the products they sell.< /review>

<text>I’ve shopped here for two different home projects, and the first time was in 2011, which I can’t say I had the best experience. The staff didn’t seem eager to help. Nobody seemed to make eye contact, lest they’d be bogged down by a customer. Despite having difficulty finding someone willing to help, I still purchased here because I was new to home remodeling and overwhelmed and just wanted to get it over with.

Second time around, I shopped around a few different places, and ended up buying most of my fixtures here again this year. Erica made great suggestions for my new home based on her experience and also took the time to get all the right parts that I needed for the shower sets that I’ve ordered. I just explained to her what type of functions that I wanted and she showed me tmwhat my options were. I spent a good hour and a half just searching for products with her and she was very helpful and knowledgeable. When I had issues with my faucet, she sent me troubleshooting instructions right away, and even when she was on vacation, another staff member took over and helped me our.

I think unless you know exactly what you want and can find cheaper options online, the expertise of the staff at Ferguson is worth the price. It’s not the cheapest, but I think fixtures and appliances are overpriced in general. You do have to wait sometimes if you want help because the nature of fixture shopping entails a lot of questions so the turnaround for staff is pretty slow, but if you make appointments ahead of time, they’re pretty good about that.</text><name>Ahreum Cho</name><time>1523067075675<//time><pics>None<//pics><Rating>4<//Rating><gmap_id>0x80dce7e1f4636cfb:0x976cf69dde2484ae<//gmap_id><UserId.>104848553066388592529< /UserId.></record>

They have a great variety in the showroom to look at, very knowledgeable staff (specifically Haley Johnson), competitive pricing, and they gave my dog treats. All in all a 5 star experience,  thank you, Ferguson!</review>

I agree with the positive comments as well as the negative because I have experienced both here. Good luck getting help here unless you hunt someone down.  Several of the sales people here have huge attitudes...WHY?.  If you don't like people don't work in a sales job.  Otherwise greet and help people as if your job depends on the sale, because it does.  I spend alot of money here when replacing fixtures, show a little respect with customers.< /Text>

<Review>I recommend making the drive to or calling the Pomona store. The Pomona store had excellent responsive service.

After the fact, the manager at the Irvine store did go out of her way to render some of the errors made by the staff in the Irvine location. Her follow-up work was five-star but the errors that occurred originally could have been avoided and saved me money and time.< /Review><user_name>jennifer bloomfield</user_name>< gmapID>

Server was awesome.  Food.. need to get a really first class chef.  There were 8 of us.  3 were really disappointed with their dinner.  This place could be a real gold mine.  Drinks were good.. does not replace a fantastic meal..
Sorry 😞 I didn't like the Fettuccine...  Mary</Text>

Food was pretty good, drinks were yummy. Just know on warm days the bugs can be a bit much and the smell of the lake can be a little over powering lol Other than that the people were friendly and it was a nice spot<//Review>

<text>Now the out side needs a little fixing but dont let that make your choice for you. The owner is really awesome and friendly. So is the guy who got our order. This places has great food and prices. The inside is nice and has a great view of the water front. You can eat outside by the water. I highly recommend this place. I will be going back.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJxSD09GFok4gn-toVWpT0-72Ayi_ZyqSMRfvV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9YUO1vZIoJuwQqHaypCJ2haH4D-Ol-SLb0ODW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP37VJZkuQE8mpio_sA71Zp7XQVpGrAQOV1-S_D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCS3QyxxRp-GzxWQBDTbUvjK4rBfexghaMWMX4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQZWOV2bt63xDcYhaXpyqGSqHLNqavVA1JhElV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHxglCVytj-dJGbkrEKU11fJAzumNaknT3KfC3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVwYnEDljhPvejT4omxgy_uRsXrQ7Ouai9zqQp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjSRmjHVJ4jAEwQA_QC-bEuB6uVA8SwRbIZe_I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3GWPDSjQuDiVjK4786eHYYmxrr5EJOnoAARz5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgoR6kWr0aPA1FpHXaIJ2rcBI3rBhmor_vYI5M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFoj4x5NRSdVRC63W1TwJSs8DYo4OYj2eu1UEL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqQMdREWVHptdjl5IEG2UHqUatcwJSXnX-7OGP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLtjxoVM5LUDPFXGc6f7o-fyXUPQ6C52wmXLHs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

This spot is the one I like best. I visit plenty of restaurants but here I  constantly return again and again. The team is very amicable and the cuisine they offer is so tasty. I am always happy to have a nice meal in this place. Highly recommended.< /Text>

<text>My kids and I drove 35 minutes in hopes to eat lunch over looking the water. We showed up to the place closed even though it says it's open online! Disappointed, looked like a really nice place to enjoy lunch on a sunny Saturday! The location is a but iffy though, surrounded by lots of run down trailers!</text><userid>101354555590556094121<//userid>< Pics>

<Text>Last night we ordered take out from the Boathouse. We were not disappointed in the least. We have eaten here several times in the past few years. The person taking my order over the phone was very nice; told me my order would be ready in 15 minutes. I was just on my way out the door and received a phone call from a very sweet young lady telling me my order was ready. We arrived and I was met at the door; due to curb side service only. Very courteous interaction and I was thanked for supporting the business. I had ordered lumpia as a starter and fish and chips. The food was well prepared and delicious. Fish and chips can be difficult to prepare; these were great and the lumpia was a treat!  Kudos to the new owners/managers of the Boathouse Restaurant👍<//Text><resp>None< /resp><Name>Judy GallagHer</Name></record>

<text>Nice vibe, they have a marina and locals pull up for a.meal and drinks. Outdoor dining right now but lots of tables. Amazing menu with things like lumpia, adobo, and other surprises. Had the steamers and garlic bread yummy! Very reasonable prices. Good service too. Stays open til 9 on weekends but open for lunch and dinner only. Have to buy food or appetizer to drink.

< Review>
Fun place hard to find hidden between homes next to lake. Live music today was very good 60's - 70's. Food was delicious and portions where large. Full bar and outdoor large patio next to lake.limited parking lot some street parking. Lots of people here having fun. Motorcycle clubs meet here for food, drink and dancing.  Lots of room for party's or groups. Boat dock attached to back of bar for boating stop and pick up of food and drinks. In the area fun place. Ice tea was very good. Huge selection of beverages from the large bar. Table service was a little slow but understandably very busy fun place on the weekend.< /Review>

Great view. Great food. Staff was friendly, a little slow but very enjoyable. So it balances out. Ribey was on point! Burger was flavorful!< /Text>

Below average fare in a questionable environment. The first word of bar and grill is bar which tells you food is not the top priority. Outside seating except they allow smoking which, correct me if needed, but I thought all smoking was banned in public places, much less food establishments. We had two jags chain smoking cigars with no regard for anyone else. I guess that's what makes cigar smokers so special. Anyway, if you can't find any other food, this will pass. Cheese and crackers from Safeway will save you a bunch of money and be about as palatable.</text>

<review>Beer selection was good. The entire staff was so friendly and the scenery outside is beautiful. My best friend forgot his phone and they watched after it until he returned. During all this you have to get food with your drink we didn't realise at first but you can even just get fries and the fries there are delicious. ... If i had to complain id make the very small complaint that parking is abit limited and kinda dodgy but due to that its quiet and not over crowded so to me that's a plus. And i liked it so much il be stopping by again today on my way out of town for a pint.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
It seems the restaurant is under new management as of Feb. 2020 (just in time for the Shelter in Place) and my experiences there all occurred previously to the change.  I'll have to drag myself in there when the Corona thing has passed (if they are still open) and write an updated review.  So take this for what it's worth.

The boathouse is a great place if you like to drink at the bar or come up from the water in a boat to drink on the deck.  They certainly seem to try hard at making a nice restaurant looking at the menu items and selection but when the place is absolutely empty except for your party and it takes over an hour to serve three main dishes and they are cold and stale you have to wonder what the problem is.  At least this has been my experience about a dozen times over the last 4-5 years.

Sure the dining room is quite dated and could use a deep cleaning, I don't mind that.  Also, the staff seem like well meaning people who are trying their best but if you're gonna run a restaurant the guests need hot fresh food in a timely manner.  Now if you're a drinker perhaps you can knock back a couple of high balls and by the time the food comes you're too buzzed to care that it's not hot or it has been an hour and a half after you received your salad/soup/app or isn't fresh and flavorful even if there are only the three or four of your group in the entire restaurant.  In fact reading through some of the 5 star reviews you might notice how many times the 'great bartender' is mentioned or the pool table or that many of the food items mentioned are basically deep fried bar food..

Now the place does have a pretty regular and busy section but that is in the bar/deck.  Since I haven't been a drinker in a long time I couldn't comment on that part but they do seem to be having a pretty good time by the sound.  The Boat House to me is like an old school Bar and Grill where the grill is there when the bar crowd need something to eat long after the Happy Hour has past.    My best experiences have been ordering take out and would suggest this to anyone focused on the food.  Sure it's usually cold by the time you get it home but you expect that.  They also generally have it ready to go when you show up.

I'm not trying to be negative this is just my honest in my assessment.  I've worked in nearly a dozen restaurants over the years and eaten at a few too.  I also live about three blocks from the place.  The only reason I've frequented the place regularly is that my parents always want to go there when visiting because it's on the lake, despite my protestations.</Review>

<Text>We couldn't be happier. We celebrated our grandmother's 90th birthday here and they took fantastic care of us. Great food, really good burgers, friendly people, and most importantly, one very happy grandma. We're so grateful!< /Text><Date>1563238320236</Date>< pics>

<text>Did the cooks go with the old management? Now they serve unseasoned fries and the fish and chips are large pieces of fish covered in a too thick, soft pancake-like substance. It was horrible.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>I don't know why this place isn't packed at all times. The food I got was amazing! I got the seafood platter with garlic fries and the calamari was to die for ❤ The service was great! Best place to get cocktails in upper lake since I've been here. Its so relaxing and by the lake. I will always come here for dinner.</Text>< Pics>

The service here was so bad on multiple occasions that I stopped going.   I understand that there is new management now, so hopefully this will be fixed.   I am only talking about the restaurant not the bar, which is run independently.</Review>

Food is really good. The outside seating is right on the water. There is lots of shade with the umbrellas. Drinks are great, especially when Diane or that cute little guy with brown hair and killer smile are making tgem.  Relaxing and fun. Music on the weekends. Go and try it.< /Text>

Edit... Good food... slow service...Great view, watch for the ocean like experience. Waves crashing, white caps.  Happens in the mid/late afternoon.... Waited 45 minuets for a burger and some fried food.  Watched the others served before us that arrived after us.  We have given this place many tried being we can't take the boat... But you must have allot of patience and time.<//Text>

<Review>Love the food and the atmosphere! Great lake views from the bar or patio seating. Has it's own dock so you can come in right off the lake. Don't come if you are in a hurry, food always takes a long time to come out whether its busy or not.< /Review>< Date>

First half the food on the menu was not available. They were out of half the appetizers and Entrees.   It was a Saturday evening and should have had these items available. Our waitress served a meal to our table and it wasn't correct. Then she tried to serve another nine of us ordered. Another lady came out yelling at her in front of us.  Then we got our bill, one from bar and one from meals.  We paid the tab. As we were outside getting ready to leave the waitress comes running outside saying we owe more money. The meal she gave incorrectly shouldn't have been charged. We had 4 glasses of champagne and were charged for 8. Very bad experience.</text>

The best food! Try the seafood basket, ribeye, chicken avocado sandwich, fish & chips ! Everything is good! Big servings. Sitting on the outdoor deck is serene & beautiful. In the winter there is fire going. I would have given 5 stars but the service is awful!!! Wait 30 minutes for drinks & had to ask where they were. Food is worth wait 😁 One time the waitress was using the F bomb in conversation with guests...maybe her friends??? I still go back for the atmosphere & food.<//text>

<Review>I had the fettuccine alfredo and it was to die for! We sat on the outdoor patio, overlooking the lake, and the view was outstanding. We decided to go back the next day for lunch and the apps were filling enough to call it a meal. The neighboring ducks are very friendly! Nice place to stop for a bite while fishing.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Went there for our Annivesary dinner (we are simple people), friendly bartender. Service was good, food too. Had the Tugboat and my husband had the Patty Melt. I would recommend going there. It's off the beaten path which makes for the better places to visit.</Text>

Early dinner with a Friend in the Dining Room, where I was most pleasantly surprised by the menu options! I chose the Caesar Salad with Grilled Prawns. The Prawns were great ~ plump, juicy, and seasoned to perfection! Since I am a local resident, I will return!
Oh, the Strawberry Shortcake, our dessert choice was fantastic, with fresh whipped cream!
Server was delightful, and the upbeat  Friday afternoon atmosphere added to our experience!</Text><userid>118343984631184668198< /userid><Gmap_id>0x8083e84859f93f01:0x240c8f59b149de94<//Gmap_id><Response>None</Response>< Pictures>

<Review>This is a great place to go just for the location and a full service bar food is good I just wish I could get a burger or steak cooked rare to med rare this is not just a problem here but almost everywhere I go. That said I still recommend the Boathouse it's a fun place to go.😎</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Review>Delicious inexpensive food. Very polite, attentive, genial and quick service. OK beer, not great but wasn't anticipating a lot of great craft beer options either. I came for the view at sunset and got a great seat outside on the deck with my son. The frogs came out -- even a few red-legged ones -- at dusk. It was busier and more social indoors and was quite chill and relaxed outdoors.</Review>< Pics>

<text>if you want a piece of local treasure you'll have to stop by this joint for at least a bloody mary if not a full-blown meal and I would highly suggest walking to the back patio for an amazing view from the deck.
make sure to check out the back bar as well for some amazing customer service from one of the best bartenders in northern California.< /text>< pics>

2nd  time no service... first time I got a menu, no drinks, and waited at least 15 minutes before I left. Second time no one even looked in the restaurant, then one waitress came in to check on her customers, didn't even look at me and went out. Waited 10 minutes altogether then as I was getting ready to leave a waitress noticed me and asked someone from the kitchen if they could wait on me... terrible service< /review>

<Text>The atmosphere is GREAT. At times, the view can be breath taking. I love the steamers(clams) aways perfect☺. The owner, Diane, she's an absolute Gem💎! They have a fantastic bar with the best view of the lake you tend to be hypnotized by it. I personally love boating right to it! Great docking,

Don't expect fast service. The food is pretty good. Sitting on the patio listening to music, and enjoying the lake views on a Sunday afternoon is worth it! Bummed they got rid of popcorn shrimp. Keep finding our way back there.<//Review>

Great live band. People were having a good time sitting outside and getting up to dance. We all had french dip sandwiches and they were tasty. I felt like the server could have been a little more polite, but it was nice that she brought my daughter's milk in a sippy cup. Soda refills were not free.<//text>

Eat here for a wonderful dining experience.  The server and cook went out of their way to accommodate my cousin who cannot have dairy for his meal.  Plus, my fresh cod was delicious!<//review>

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>Start to finish, it was just awful! When we got there, there was nobody sitting in the dining area. several people at the bar, and 3 tables fiull out on the deck. We asked to sit out there, and they said no, they're not set up to serve out there. ( Even as I watched them being food to these tables outside, but, yeah, whatever.)

We rarely saw our server. She popped by once in awhile to mutter a sorry about this, and that. We ordered garlic chicken wings, which were DISGUSTING! They were Luke warm, and at the bone was ICE COLD. Being at it looked cooked, this was obviously frozen precooked garbage that they couldn't even heat right. ( Guess I'm lucky they didn't actually cook them).

I ordered the fettuccine with chicken. The fettuccine was ok. Bland, but creamy. The chicken was rubber, and I'm pretty sure from the awful consistency,  and freezer burned taste, that it was not fresh. The seasoned fries were ok. A dab of flavor, but at least these were cooked.

Hubby got chicken fried steak, that was cooked. It was cooked so well, the outside was about burnt. Never seen a steak this well done before. Pretty sure it was just steak. It was tough, and hard to cut. Usually chicken fried steak is super tender. But, I'm sure they didn't know, since everything is frozen and processed, and not made there. (Guessing)

We ordered two blue Hawaiians, which, the bartender tried, but they were disgusting. She never made one, and I guess winged it. She did offer to fix it, if we didn't like it, but we were already  disgusted with this place, we didn't. even bother.

Best thing was the raspberry cheesecake, which came from the cheesecake factory. lol. I think this place  has a fridge and microwave, and that's their source of cooking. NOTHING was fresh, or even good.< /Text>< resp>

Typical hometown dive. Mainly a bar but is a decent bite for the dollar. Not a first choice and can be overpriced. Service is mid grade.</Review>

Food was good but service was extremely poor ticket time was over an hour.  Waitress said she would discount for the very slow service but took off only one beer off for the whole tab of four people.  It was around 1:15 and the restaurant was not that busy.  Owner/manager was nowhere to be found while service was seem to be having a meltdown.</Review>

7-23-16 Burgers barely edible. Didn't get the right order. Took 2 hours to receive order. 3 in the morning...woke up and yeah you got it, rolling stomach...food poisoning. Bad guts all next day. Money not well spent. Had better there before but they blew it this time.<//review>

Just a great local hangout. Full bar, friendly locals and fair prices. The burgers and ribs are outstanding and the view is incomparable. Great little neighborhood bar and grill, basically.<//Text>

Okay,  the place isn't the fanciest,  but the food was really good. I had the Smokehouse burger. Well worth the price.</Review>

<Review>I sure do love waiting an hour for one burger! It's so much fun just sitting outside in the scorching heat. I especially love it when the anti-social waiters come out to ask if I want a refill (which they don't give me for over 30 minutes). The food is pretty good though, especially because I'm allergic to fish. I specifically told them that I can't eat any type of fish, So when I asked for the burger with a side of fries I was shocked that the fries tasted like fish. They obviously fry their fries and their fish in the same frier and don't give a damn about people with allergies. So sadly I had to spend the rest of my busy day in an emergency room.<//Review>< Pics>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>Food is good but only if your willing to wait 2+ hours for it. So don't come here expecting you'll be eating soon. Second time here, thought I'd give it another chance after my first experience which was horrible; it took them more then the 2+ hours it normally takes and they still messed up our order. I don't think I'll be coming back as they messed up my order again<//Review>< Pictures>

Food is good. View is beautiful from the patio. But the service is pretty slow, so it's not a good choice, if  you're not willing to be patient.<//Text>

Terrible service!!! Only one waitress FOR THE WHOLE RESTAURANT!!! Food was mediocre AT BEST!
This place is more for the local yokels than tourists. But it's the only restaurant in town. After that there are just bars, again just for the local yokels!!!<//Text>

After wine. We waited 1 hr & 10 min before meal was served. Our guest had to travel back to Sacramento. Food was aweful!!! Hopefully it was a off night for their cook.< /Review>

fish and chips were disappointing,  the waitress seemed like she was ready to leave this place way before we got here and was horrible, the bartender started off great, but then completely forgot about us once her friends got here.  unless you are a local stay away< /review>

< review>
The Boathouse has been a staple for guests for some time now but recently new management took over the kitchen and really stepped up the menu and service. The food can best be described as comfort food with barbecue as well and a number of intriguing daily specials. There's a full bar as well with a view of Clear Lake plus outdoor seating in the summer with bands featured  on Sunday afternoons.

Recently we had some sandwiches delivered which is usually unremarkable but I happened to get the tri tip sandwich. Bottom line, the tri tip had a wonderful smoky flavor and was as tender as can be. I avoid tri tip sandwiches because you usually end up with gristle surprise which ruins the experience - not in this case. It was tender and meaty from bite one to the end. The only disappointment was having finished the sandwich, darnit. But they'll make more!

We have sent many guests down the street to the Boathouse and have heard plenty of very positive reviews of the food and service. Being regulars ourselves we can attest to the warm atmosphere of this local hangout. The food is consistent and good, prices are very fair and service is generally quite good as well. We're pretty fortunate to have such a cool local hangout just a few steps down the street from us.<//review>
