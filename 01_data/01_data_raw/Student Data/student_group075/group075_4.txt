<text>Although they did seem to touch pn all services offered, it seemed they weren't very thorough for the price charged. My seats weren't wiped down, I still had some pollen spots and bugs on my car when returned to me, and debris in the crevis near windshield. My car isn't even 6 months old, so it wasn't a difficult dirty job.< /text>< pictures>

Man, slowest service ever. Everytime I come here its gets slower and slower. Now I remember why I don't come very often.  1 hour and my cat is not even in the line to get washed yet. If It wasn't desperate for a wash, I'd be gone.</review>

< Review>
When here to get my Truck washed and when they then to pre-wash it they person Juan with a camouflaged sun hat. When to take off the antenna he used a Crescent wrench. I watch him throw the window trying to take off by hand first then he used a crescent wrench. This is the and results what happen on a new Truck. And I check with the Manager and show him and told him who it was then he got the owner Jin Choi and he came look at it then want and got Juan and ask him if he did it of course not. So the Owner does not want to do anything CAR OWNER BEWARE.</Review>

I just came home from the car wash an hour ago.  I paid the $40 to get it washed and waxed.  As soon as I left I noticed there were marks on the windows (maybe wax). I was kissed but didn’t go back.  I get home and get my winded to clean windows and I joe ice the same spots on my hood.   I’m like wth. So I wipe them off and no joke the napkin was dirty.  I’m like? Did they not wash my car? I’m so unhappy with the service.  The automatic $10 was through the machine does a better job, if not the same.  Don’t waste your money.<//Review>

< review>
I used to bring my car here a few years ago but quit because it was too expensive and not a good job! I usually do my own but decided to try this place again since it is up the street from me. It is still too expensive and they still do a lousy job! I had to have them re vacuum it and the windows and mirrors are so smeared I have to do them over. I also had to go over the console area and inside of door when I got home. I went early hoping that would make the difference. I won't go back.<//review>

Quality of the wash was okay. Though I waited there for about an hour. Apparently car had been ready but they neglected to tell me and they forgot air freshener that I didn't notice until I had left since I was irritated. Guess the guys were too busy talking to the cute cashier.<//text>

The 4x4 system locks up when it senses there's no traction so three of the guys helped guide and drive it through the wash. Not a scratch and they had a good laugh about it.

<Review>This is the 2nd time it has happened to me. The first time,i was charged for the superior car wash and the guys just ran it thru without any wax. Today i went again and I paid a much more expensive package and with that came the spray was. This was never done and when i confronted the employee, he pretended that he didn't know English and he was showing me the spray can trying to tell me that he used that spray. I knew it was a lie and when i opened the trunk it was still messy. Never vacuumed. I am just letting everyone know to be careful when you take your vehicle there for a carwash. I will never go there again to be robbed again.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

<Text>Do not go here, they broke my driver side mirror and refused to fix it. I noticed this right away, and went and got a worker and  a manager to come look at it, he played with it and put in back into place, he told me to let him know if it keeps happening, which it keeps falling out while on the road, so i went over there to let them know it keeps faliing out and needs to be repalced they said they can take care of it there at the Car wash so when i asked him are you certified to for that, this is a car wash spot, he said they can glue it, the man was very disrespectful the way he was speaking to me told me that they guy who first looked at the mirror doesnt speak good english and that no they would no replace it.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1535742640895, 'text': "Nothing was wrong with her mirror but she came in fake estimate printed from her work (tire shop) for $690.

Then she said it is making noise when she try to adjust it and which wasn't making any noise...that's when she pull that mirror piece out of side mirror unit demanding money...she is not very clever scam artist and I will talk to the owner of the tire shop about this."}< /resp>< gmap_id>

They start out by hand, run it through the machine wash, then dry by hand. They claim that their machines have softer material to wash as opposed to a regular drive through wash. Didn't matter... On inspection, I immediately saw swirl marks after the wash. The dry was just ok, I still had to dry areas on my car when I got home. I asked for just an exterior only and it costs $10. For the price I would expect that I wouldn't have to do any extra work like drying. Very upset that one of my new car's first washes left swirl marks that will now need attention.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c35517d3fe0431:0xc7262297a52a1374< /gmap_id><rate>1< /rate><Time>1465307525638</Time></record></dataset><record>

So disappointed.  Prices are high..they charge more for SUV and trucks even is they are the smaller version. Senior day is Thursday with $5 OFF but then charge you more for SUV. My SUV is not an escalade so if my SUV is the same size as a Toyota Camry why do I pay more. They didn't open the vehicle up to clean my third roll seats so y did I have to pay more. I won't be back< /text>

<Text>Had a horrible drive through experience. The wait took forever to begin with, about 15min, and I had to go to work. An older man working the cashier took my card, then started carrying it around from register to other places, and was confused on what to charge. This made me feel very uneasy.. He overcharged my order and the manager had to give me the difference in cash.. I ordered just one burger and I had to wait 10min at the window. I have ALOT of patience but this was horrible and very surprising. How did this man get hired here? He should not be working at all, I felt unsafe and very uncomfortable, and to top it off, I was late for work.. Never coming back here again.. HORRIBLE experience.<//Text>< rate>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>The food was not very good. The lady working the drive thru asked me to park in the front so that she could make the kids meals fresh for my kids, yet my kids fries were stuck together full of oil, I threw most of them away. Their chicken stars were hard, they complained about their food, they normally eat great! Please do better it was definitely a waste of money!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<text>1/4/2020. I Just went in and asked nicely would you please make me a yummy fresh burger and they did with a smile. I’m telling you nothing better than a fresh cooked famous star. Sorry to say it’s a rare thing but this trip rocked.

It’s better that the menu boards can be upgraded to monitor based with dynamic menu and meal pictures. Besides, the menu seems to have less items than other stores in Irvine, so is their customer service.< /text>

Their lemonade is bland.  I know they only serve lemonade light on the soda machine but other Carl's location lemonade is more tasteful.  Told the employee about this and they said everything is working fine.  They don't even want to taste it, just shrug me off telling me that there must be something wrong with the machine....and that was 2 weeks ago.  When I'm back this past Wednesday...it's still the same.<//review>

I ordered off postmates and the didn't follow any of the instructions and messed up my order but the problem is they burned both my patties to charcoal and they weren't even the bigger patties i paid for. When i called the lady who claimed to be in charge blamed the burgers being burnt on the postmates driver (i dont understand the thinking on that) and then just had attitude</Text>

This is my favorite Carl's. The staff is always friendly and receptive. For breakfast, the biscuits and gravy are fabulous. My wife had the breakfast burrito today and it was everything she expected. The place is always clean. Because it's one of the larger Carl's Jr., there's lots of comfortable seating. The drive-thru is fast and efficient. Everything you want in a fast food restaurant.< /review>

Overall experience was good, food was good. Only issue I had on this visit is that repairs were being made to the ceiling and the person doing the repairs failed to place drop cloths on the seating areas as well as the carpet. In my opinion the repair should have been done after hours due to dust particles in the air which were visible. But food was good nonetheless.</Text>

<text>I love Carls Jr. My favorites are gravy and biscuits. They make the best biscuits I have ever eaten. Also the Santa Fe Western chicken sandwich. Which I buy a lot. The only problem I have with them is this, you are paying extra for the Ortega chili and they only give you a little tiny strip. I always have to tell them to give me a larger piece of chili. I got home one day and had 2 little pieces about the size of a quarter. So your places need to be told about this. And no raising the price. Ok? Thank you.<//text>< pics>

The service was mediocre to say the least....if you have multiple customers in line, don't just stand there and ignore them for a few minutes. Usually when you get called for your order to go they at least ask if you want any ketchup or sauce...nope.
The food was terrible. Ordered a number 1 (famous star meal)...they put so much mayo and ketchup on the burger that the bun was mushy and falling apart before I even fully unwrapped the burger. They didn't even spread out the toppings. One spot had only onions, one spot had only tomatoes and one spot had only pickles. When they did call my order and I asked for ketchup, he gave me a handful...the only problem was the outside of the packets were covered in a syrup-like sticky substance.
Home of the $6 burger....more like home of the mush patty.
I know it's fast food, so I shouldn't expect much. But I was a paying customer. Regardless of what your job is, good customer service should be important.
Won't be eating at Carl's Jr. anymore.<//text>

I have stopped here a few times and it seems the burgers (the last few visits) have come to me cold. Cheese not melted and such. Other Carl's Jr the food has come to me warmer if not hot. I'm guessing the food made ahead of time.</text>

Not the worst Carl's I've been to. Super empty, eerily quiet. There was only one crack head, so I guess not too bad for this type of place. I had the saddest salad I've ever eaten in my life,  but what do I expect from a Carl's Jr??</text>

Bad Customer service!! We waited in the drive thru line for 10 min & finally got to the speaker phone 1 minute after 10:30 & was told breakfast is not being served anymore. We have 12 very hungry girls at the house from a sleepover & all they wanted was Carl's Jr breakfast & I asked if he can still help me out considering & refused to serve us breakfast 1 minute after. This place is getting worst & worst & no one seems to want to fix the Problem, 18 year residents in Woodbridge & we will not support this Carl's Jr location again. If you serve breakfast burgers all day what would have been the difference.<//Review>

I have been here more than three times . Every occassion was great experience . I have tried their toast , sides ,burgers , coffee .. all served quick and fast .  Their zuccini fry sides are amazing . Even one can try their fresh french toast . They are heavenly .all of the items i tried were hot and freshly prepared
.Also, the staff are polite and helpful .<//Review>

Place felt a bit dirty and run down inside. Placed my order to go inside and when I got home I was missing my fries for my kid. It was to far to go back just for fries so I paid for food I never received.</Review>

< Review>
I stop by here when I can but sometimes wish I could stop in everyday because there is no other GNC like it. I train regularly so I try to snack on nutrition bars and other snacks that health stors have. This store particularly puts their snacks where they are easy to reach and I find really good deals. The powders, and the capsules are priced down to but what I love about GNC is they usually give samples of their new vitamin candy. The products have to change eventually but its been like 1 year that this store has always had chewable vitamins C,D,Multi,Calcium, and B12 seriously I can't thank them enough. I always encourage other GNC stores to do their promotions and sales like these guys at this location 5 star rating guys  hope you know everyone there is like a fitness guru to me even if they don't know what I'm talking about they try to answers my questions and stop to talk when I stop by rushing to get back to my errands I need to make a pit stop first to see you guys thanks for your patience every time.<//Review>

I used to like visiting this GNC because I can walk to it. Now I only go here for Snacks since they don’t seem to know enough about the products I’m interested in.< /review>

Overpriced! The deals don’t even make sense. Atleast 3 times she told me to take advantage of the “Buy 5 get 1 free deal” for the snacks. I only wanted a few and if I gave in only
Would have saved 5cents.</review>

The receptionists here are irritating and come across as  condescending. The accountants are the only reason this place gets 3 stars. This is by far the most irritating experience I’ve ever had with an hr block and am regretting my decision to do my taxes here<//review>

I will continue with H&R block next year but will complete online. The person who did my return was a nice guy but I didn't get the feeling his was confident in what he was doing. The only reason why I went in person instead of doing online is because of possible education credits and I didn't know how to enter my stuff for uber and lyft. I had to also had to argue with him on how to enter my checking account number for my refund... he kept trying to enter the check number as a part my account number and he was hesitant because it didn't match the example on that screen. He ended up giving me the keyboard and I had to enter my banking details for him. Again, nice guy but I was pretty frustrated by the time I left. I wish I would have left before my taxes were completed and finished online. the fee's were too high I though for a simple tax return.<//text>

<Text>Always such welcoming staff. I have been to numerous dentist offices throughout the Greater Sacramento area and this is BY FAR the best dental office. Dr. Mac and Liliana are patient, caring, and professional. Between anxiety from a root canal to chipped front teeth (multiple times), I always have a great experience. It is not often you brag about your dentist office but I constantly tell people about them.

The dental cleanings are fantastic, referral perks, and a great location to top it off. Thank you McEwen Dental for taking great care of me.</Text>< user>

Best dental practice around. Dr. Mac was very gentle when getting my anesthetic shot couldn't even feel it. While getting my procedure done he was very attentive and really down to earth along side him was a great assistant. Couldn't be happier. He fixed my front tooth which needed to be re filled and he made it look like my natural tooth again now I can smile without be self conscious again. Great place and will be a forever patient. Oh yeah he was even more than happy to do an adjustment for me after my procedure. Thanks McEwen dental my wife will be coming to you as well.< /Review>

<Review>I went here on recommendations from a friend and coworkers. I admit it had been a while since my last dentist appointment (I won’t say how long, but long enough), and I didn’t get any judgment. From my dental hygienist to my dentist I was treated with the utmost care. All my questions and concerns were addressed nonjudgmentally and I felt validated with  my concerns and questions. They worked with me on finding the right treatment plan with my insurance and went through every step of my visit thoroughly. I’ve never felt more taken care of. I’ll recommend this McEwen Dental to everybody I know, if they are asking for a dental recommendation or not!<//Review>< date>

<review>Dr. Greg McEwen saved me not only additional work, but fit me in the same day I was in need. As a new patient I didn't expect this, but was extremely appreciative. He's been nothing but honest, up front, and extremely gentle with the procedures I've had performed.

Sidenote the CAD crowns are amazing, and it was very convenient to have an entire crown done in one visit!</review><Time>1555712943249</Time>< Gmap_id>

Always a pleasure going in for my check ups! Melissa is a fantastic hygienist, very caring & genuine! And, she always remembers you! Drs McEwen are also fantastic! And that's coming from one who really dreaded seeing a dentist. Dr McEwen was aware of my fear of needles & made me comfortable from the very beginning. I highly recommend giving them a try if your are looking for a dental home.< /Text>

Highly recommend this place. The doctors are a father/son team and both are very good. Staff is friendly and sensitive to different needs. Free WiFi and a referral program that earns you free whitening molds and kits. They also play Mix 96 all day.<//review>

You know no one likes the dentist, everyone wants to avoid it like the plague!  But I can tell you hands down this is the best dental practice in the Sacramento area! Father-son team and the hygentists are amazing along with the receptionist staff! I can't rave enough about this office!!!</Review>

Highly recommend! The office staff was so nice and welcoming.  They made me feel like I was going to be in good hands from the start.  Once I met Dr. McEwen he reassured me that they would get me out of pain and he delivered on that promise better then I could imagine.  Never felt the injection when he numbed me up and made me a crown in the same visit! I will never go to any other dentists and will be sending all friends and family to Dr. McEwen.  O and don't forget about the assistants, beyond friendly and will go out of their way to make you feel at ease.<//text>

<Review>I am so extatic to have found a dentist whom does his job super well! Dr. M Sr performed a root canal without any pain. From injecting the anesthesia till the end. Thank you so much for your patience, communication, and kindness. It’s very hard to find now a days! Thank you to the office staff for being soooo helpful and kind! So lucky to have found our family dentistry!!!!!!!<//Review><user>117713415457176187974<//user><Date>1544203914420<//Date><gmapID>0x809adbd6b0b5a39b:0xefef322a328d4e9< /gmapID><response>None< /response>< pics>

<Review>Best dental office! Doctors place your concerns and needs as a top priority while giving you multiple options for your treatment plan. And their staff is second to none displaying amazing chairside manners and making sure you are comfortable.  Patient care is top priority at this office!< /Review>< Pics>

Excellent level of professionalism, great quality of dentistry. The whole office staff seems to really care for the treatment of the patient while being very friendly. Highly Recommended!

I hate the pain that comes with the injection but I did not feel any pain during the numbing process. That really allowed me to relax during the treatment. Thank you McEwen Dental!</review>

Dr. Gregory M.K. McEwen and his team are true professionals.  Highest quality dental care experience (especially for the apprehensive, like me).  Now, I actually look forward to completing the remainder  of the work to be done.<//Review>

<Text>I had a wisdom tooth that was giving me excruciating pain, because I had a cavity and I made the mistake of putting some oragel / ambesol in it (don't do it, trust me, it does the polar opposite of numbing the pain) and I came to see the doc.

He chatted with me for a few minutes, then he got to work. It was in a very difficult position and yet he managed to get it out and out in less time that it took for us to say hi and bye. He has an amazing hand when it comes to injections and numbing you before procedures. My girlfriends family has been coming here for about 10 years and now I will too< /Text>< Pics>

My family and I have been using Dr. McEwen as our family dentist in sacramento for over 20 years and his service has always been excellent.  He's done everything from cleanings and fillings to crowns and root canals.   I highly recommend Dr. McEwen for all your dentistry needs.< /review>

<review>I spent 5000 dollars to get architectural plans drawn up for an Adu.  Their contract said that they have to get it approved for permitting in order to fulfill their end of the contract.. They got denied and didn't try any further to get the plans amended or approved in any way.  They just shrugged their shoulders and walked away with my money.  They even had the balls to call me months later and try to collect in the final installment.  I wouldn't trust them at all.

I still have no Adu..  And I'm tempted to just do it without permits.  Which is not what it wanted at all.< /review>< response>

These guys can’t do anything as far as construction goes . They worked on my aunts house she is 75 years old they pretty much robbed her of 63k $ didn’t even finish the job . They were rude called her grandma and would laugh at her. They even put the back door  threshold  On backwards . They should be ashamed of themselves.</Review>

<text>It has been nearly a year since I hired this company to paint the exterior of my house.  At first, I was really happy with them.  The contractor lady seemed to be understanding of what I wanted and expected.  Much like the other reviews, there was no one overseeing the project and when I told them that the colors did not match what I had explained to them I wanted, they started adding extra stipulations.  The house also needed some "touch ups" which they never came back to do.  Allegedly the paint has a lifetime "warranty" that I have yet to see.</text><Name>Priscilla Showers<//Name></record>

I needed some immediate help for an event at an upscale home. We asked them to finish the construction within 2 weeks.

They did minor repairs in the outdoor area and also remodeled kitchen. ( Cabinets counter floors and windows)
They did it quickly and efficiently. I couldn’t have been more pleased.
I give them 10 out of 10.
If you are looking for an honest company- look NO FURTHER!!
Would definitely use them again if I need any construction remodeling done.< /text>< resp>

Sterling refinished our home with vinyl siding and insulation.  Although there were delays in starting the job, the job was completed and we were satisfied with the work. I did ask for the leftover vinyl siding in case we ever needed to replace a piece.  No siding was left.  Siding has fallen off the house and I’ve tried for over four months to get them to repair the work.  They committed to do the work over a month ago and nothing’s been done except to ignore my phone calls. After paying over $40,000, properly installed siding shouldn’t be falling off!</Text>

<review>We decided to hire Sterling Builders for our remolding project.
We called and they came out for an estimate a day after.
Moe was great! He heard us out and didn’t pressure us.
He assured us everything would be fine , he explained the process and how is company works.

The price was right and we liked his attitude.
The team started to work a day after!
They finished the job earlier than expected. They even stayed late on some days..
We are so satisfied with the yard.
We had zero problems with our first project with a contractor and I am so relieved.

Thank you Moe and the team!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

We love our new home.
This is a long overdue review for Sterling Builders Group .
We met with Denny for consultation after he was referred to us by a co worker.
We were all on the same page and Denny was u front about everything in the contract.
We did new doors and closet doors, new custom bath and exterior gate.
Denny worked extra hard to make it fast as promised.< /text>

We had to remodel our downstairs bathroom because of a mold problem. They were nothing but helpful, responsive and efficient from our first interaction until the construction was completed.
They impressed me with the quick response to any questions or concerns that I had during the process.
The manager ran his crew like a well oiled machine.. each one of the crew was near and extremely qualified in their job.<//Review>

I worked directly with Chris and  I can't say enough good things.
He is INCREDIBLY responsive and provided updates on timing, repairs, issues via calls+ text.  I was out of town for some of the major repairs and Chris provided daily updates to show progress and help address any of my concerns.
He really cares about the customers and wants to make sure the job is done right.  It's great to have someone that is so responsive and help address any questions/concerns. 5 stars!</review>

Aaron was great. His estimate was the cheapest ive got in the past two weeks.  I searched 8 different companies and they were the most reliable on the phone.  Aaron and his guys finished the job within the next week because i had the kids over.  They came back and worked for 4 more days...  I love the final results it was modern and clean it looked like a very expensive professional job.< /review>

<review>Although I was contacted promptly to schedule an appointment for a free in home consultation, the Scheduler Coordinator, Nikita, would not send someone out to my house unless both, my husband and I are available for the appointment. I explained to her that my husband has a very unusual and busy schedule and he might or not be home for the consultation. I also told her that all what I was asking was for a quote and we were not signing any contract yet, as I'm still shopping around. She said that they had a situation where husband and wife were separating and one signed a contract without the other's consent and they both wanted different type of stone for counter tops in the kitchen, and due to that they required both legal owners on the title of the house to be present. Didn't I just tell her that I was requesting a quote only? Then I said, that I had other companies aligned for consultation and if they didn't want to deal just with me for the quote, I was going to just consider the rest of the contractors I have already contacted for an appointment. She just said "Ok, no problem". Well, I guess my projects will never go to this company. I won't even consider them for a quote.<//review>< Time>

Hired Sterling to remodel the bathrooms.
Their quote was reasonable compare to other proposals we got.
Denny was the manager of the project.
He was very knowledgeable and had plenty of ideas for style , design and colors.
The whole process was smooth and the job was completed on time.
I will definitely recommend them for anyone who need contractor.< /text>

<text>Sterling Builders Group are top notch . What an amazing crew!
I worked with many companies and they were the best . I moved here from Torrance area and got a new place, they came after only two days after calling them. The crew was so nice and professional they fixed and remodeled three rooms. It took them several months to finish all the remodeling. I loved how they didn't surprise me with any additional charges. I'm so grateful that i found them.! Very nice and fast.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Extremely helpful and gave me a lot of options to choose.

Jacob is easy going with great attitude and will keep you up to date with your order progress.

I researched a number of contractors online.
Sterling Builders were the first one I talked to they answered my questions in a professional non pushy fashion.
I was impressed with his past jobs as well .
Great communication from the start .
They were on time , affordable and worked until we said the job is done.
Great company for construction.</Text>

<Text>I am very pleased with Sterling Builders!!
We met Aaron a few months ago and decided to go with them .
They do good work and fair prices, awesome contractors to deal with. They were the closest local company to provide the best deal in adding a newly remodeled bathroom in our home.

We got a great quote, they were exactly what they said they would be.
The crew they provided were all hardworking people.
Quality of work was beautiful!!!
Ask for Aaron he is the one we dealt with.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c299a81bff99a5:0x690507d9d6ea56f8< /gmapID></record>

<Text>Fantastic experience. they incorporate great style and design and make sure to give you a state of the art kitchen, when you need little perks added... such as the island spinning cabinets, and a hidden wine cellar - just the right size to make it fit but also make it look good and easy to get to. everything we wanted they did for us... prices were reasonable, and it was easy to work out a payment plan.<//Text><user_id>104464614458477214801< /user_id>< Rate>

I fell in love immediately in that design and wanted the exact same thing. I contacted several contractors but they all wanted much more than I was willing to spend. Sterling promised me to keep it within my budget and they did ! I am so in love with my new hamam-like bath.... they did it a bit different but they came up with this new idea and it was worth listening to them. very talented and creative. it actually works better with the new tiles they imported for me.... in love!!!!< /text>< pics>

Thank you sterling for being an amazing remodeling company!
We called them to remodel our bathroom in our house in Los Angeles. Everything was exactly the way they promised. Every morning the workers arrived on time. They did a great job and left the place clean every time.
Very detailed, very professional and they paid  attention to the small details I was concerned about.
We enjoyed working with MDM very much and we would highly recommend them to everyone!</Review>

we were in such a mess for a whole month, it was just a really bad time for us... we hired another contractor and he ended up bailing on us mid project. we felt helpless and we had to keep working. a friend recommended sterling and when i first called them they already started us the process for us. they made it very easy, they set up a date and from there it went smoothly. the project manager took over the mess we had, and made sure it was all fixed. the kitchen and the rooms look amazing! so happy we called them,<//review>

To be honest I was fixing my own house for years... Three different houses I did it all by myself I was very proud of it. Last time we had a person helping us with the garden so I'm okay to hire outside help.
Now I am in a  situation where I have to work more. I did not have time to deal with the house... So I decided to hire a company from outside. It was important to me to hire a company with good reviews and someone that can provide good service. I do not trust just anyone.
Sterling are excellent they renew the entire house from the basement to the roof. Flawless work I am so happy I did not do it myself. I was checking on them every single day and nothing has been done that I did not like.< /review>

There are so many companies out there it was hard differentiate the good ones from the scams. When the guys came over to give me a precise estimate I immediately knew that they were going to be the best for me.

<text>Adam the estimator did a fantastic job- he clearly been in the business for quite some time now. we went over the details over the phone and then the construction work followed by weekly phone calls to make sure it all went smoothly.
Adam supervised everything and everyone, I felt that I had Time to relax and not come by all the time. every day a fair amount of progress was made. kitchen was done first while they were working at the same time on the bathroom and two beds.

This people are a joke. Trying to con people by saying that they need this and that when it's not true. This people put my family in harm's way by leaving electrical hot wires out of the wall when they knew that I had 3 siblings at home. They did not complete the job and left my kitchen trashed up I don't recommend this people at all next time I will hire some professionals to do a man's job. I feel sorry for this company and they're poor job experience.</Text>

I wasnt leaving there at the time and he was very communicative about where he was on the project.
He would text and email about the updates, questions or just giving options for the job.
I really liked the pictures he sent daily so I knew what was going on.
I will use again in the future< /text>< Pictures>

They are not the least expensive contractors out there, but you get what you pay for. Their work is of the highest quality, and they want each and every customer to be happy and satisfied.  Additionally if they find problems in the foundation, plumbing, whatever, along the way, you will not receive a call telling you there is a huge problem and it will cost you an additional amount of money amounting to!!!! No, they will just take care of it!!! if you are a woman like me and don't trust contractor, these guys will take care of you, and will not take advantage of you.< /Review>

<Text>Sterling Builders worked their magic on our kitchen and master bedroom.
I am more than happy with the design, the workmanship and customer service both during and after the project completion.
The workers were outstanding!
The company was great every step of the way , they helped me pick up the cabinets , floors, counter top sinks, faucets , etc.
It worked together perfectly and look amazing.!!
Prices, documentation and the timing for changes were very fair.
I would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants the job done quickly and efficiently.
Final price was reasonable.
I am happy to recommend them and work with them on my next project!< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80c299a81bff99a5:0x690507d9d6ea56f8< /Gmap_id><userid>116500923418361863587<//userid><date>1517878989046</date>< Pictures>

Sterling Builders are truly the BEST!! They installed pavers in front of the garage and in my driveway.
The men know what they are doing. The work was performed on time.
They exceeded my expectations..Their suggestions turned out to be more than I would hoped for.
I am happy that I went with this company.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I had been meaning to write my review for our remodel for awhile.
We spent three months meeting with different general contractors and finally we found Sterling Builders.
From the beginning of our relationship to project completion our needs were taken care of.  We met with Guy, he understood our vision for our home remodeling and gave us great ideas for the design. He kept the budget reasonable and overall was great to work with him. It all worked out beautifully.
The kitchen was finished in a timely manner and was beyond what we had even expected!
I'm very pleased to say that I'll be calling on Sterling Builders for my next remodel.
Thank you so much for going above and beyond!<//Text>< Pictures>

Been working with another company and they did not do a good job for the tiles. We had our wood floors removed and they did some mistakes ...
The water leaked in between the tiles and for several years I have let it be like that.
Sterling came to our rescue, they pay attention to details and didn’t cut any corners!!!! Very professional and they felt for us. They installed a new ceramic tile flooring for two levels in our home and the manager made sure it was done exactly right.<//Text>

<Review>Sterling Builders Group was my kitchen remodel contractor. The guys were incredible thorough and beat the timeline in two days . They worked well with my schedule. I am so relieved that everything worked out so well and so glad that we selected Sterling Builders to do our work. They are indeed a first class company. !! I am very pleased with the outcome.</Review>< user_name>

Sterling Builders are truly the BEST!! They installed pavers in front of the garage and in my driveway.
The men know what they are doing. The work was performed on time.
They exceeded my expectations..Their suggestions turned out to be more than I would hoped for.
I am happy that I went with this company.</review>

<Text>Eli was wonderful to work with not only because he was patient but because he informs you about any little change.
The bathroom was done entirely from the only one... but they broke it all done and put marbles and stainless steel on in all.
Wooded shutters for the windows, he said it is great fir the moister.<//Text><user_name>קים מזור<//user_name><UserId.>114814936710206414458</UserId.>< resp>

I am smacking myself for not writing this review about Sterling builders sooner, but I tend to be wordy and there is so much to say.  I met with many contractors, and had a couple contractors in the past who were okay, but left me with some small  undone issues at the end that I had to at the least, pay a handyman to finish up.  I did not want that to happen again.
I made an appointment for a meeting with them to discuss the addition of a Master Suite. Everyone were so creative, and helped with selections, advising what would or wouldn't work if I was in doubt.  One or the other met me at tile stores and the like, held my hand throughout the whole process!<//Text>

We used their service for some repair job on the roof.
Denny arrived to my house on time and gave us a quote on the same day
He was making sure to give a lot of details so we understand the whole process
They have great workers .
Denny made sure to stay in touch daily
Five stars all the way.

Finding a good , honest contractor can be a daunting task. So when I found Sterling Builders Group on yelp and due to all their good reviews , I decided to get a bid from them . Eli came up with great ideas for design and gave me a lot of information about the construction.
He sticks to the construction schedule and keeps good communication during the project he is very organized.
Our master bedroom came out so amazinh .<//review>

They could not stop raving about Sterling Builders .  The situation is they had a garage they wanted turned into another master bedroom.  I called in to get them the quote they had to get someone out there to do a visual quote however.
He went over all that we would need to do to get the correct layout , they had to replace some of the walls and ceiling framing , they also put in a window and and insulation in side the walls even added a walk way.  There was a bathroom already in the garage but was used more as a storage room, so they needed to renovate and replace old pipes to new pipes . Electrical been updated and got lights installed and add some extra outlets .

Long story short sterling has been of a great service to us!!! We were so stressful because we just to our new home. From the very start everything broke and was so bad... we're so greatful to have found Sterling builders . They promised us that they will fix it for us, the roof, walls, kitchen cabinets and the bedrooms. It was all done within the price they gave us and it was done with a special care... great costumer service . So so grateful for them thank you for saving our home.<//text>

My wife and I are doing a total interior house remodel. We have been extremely selective on the look and feel of the tile and granite. One Sunday, at the end of the day we came across Sterling builders.  We were working with a designer and she collaboratively worked with us all and after several appointments we got an awesome look. Now her next gift was the recommendation of a tile and granite person for the install! We are perfectionists and couldn't be more satisfied with our experience with them<//review>

After calling several companies for the past half a year I finally agreed to call sterling which I got their number from a friend.
They gave me an estimate and also send me a written one. At the end they stuck to it and never over changed me! It was my first house I ever porchaed so I was in a rush to get it done the right way.
Perfectionists and always on time. Clean and patient. Amazing< /Review>

<Review>Def worth 10 stars not only five !!!
You can tell from the start that you are in good hands. From the beginning they give the feeling that it is not going to be stressful for you, because they have it all handled: paint, demolition and all the plans are according to what you agreed with them. I have problems with the city and they helped me get it taken care of.<//Review>< pictures>

< review>
I have used sterling builders services twice in the past three years. Once for a relatively small job in the outside and garage.
The second time I called them was for a much more complicated project. It was big for me because the house was built in the early 20s and I wanted to remodel but also keep the original tiles and wood.
They brought in excellent subs electrician and plumber... the roof was also taken care of as part of the deal. They worked around my schedule and did not work on weekend so I had some time to go over the house and they cleaned after them every single day. The were able to stick to the written estimate that they gave me<//review>

I worked with Jonah from Sterling he was our project manager for a full renovation on our new home in Pacific Palisades . Good quality of materials. Honest people !! And the price was reasonable.
Highly recommended<//Text>

<text>I have used sterling builders services twice in the past three years. Once for a relatively small job in the outside and garage.
The second time I called them was for a much more complicated project. It was big for me because the house was built in the early 20s and I wanted to remodel but also keep the original tiles and wood.
They brought in excellent subs electrician and plumber... the roof was also taken care of as part of the deal. They worked around my schedule and did not work on weekend so I had some time to go over the house and they cleaned after them every single day. The were able to stick to the written estimate that they gave me<//text>< Pics>

<text>It was so hard finding someone online, because you can never know if they are good or not. These guys completely revitalized my house. I've never even seen people work that hard before, just straight up and right to it until it was done. With my husband constantly trying to fix up things around the house himself, we needed a serious renovation. we started the project on the house over two years ago, I just knew there was no way I could find the time. Finally we decided to finish it! Low and behold, hired these guys on a whim and it was totally worth it.< /text>< time>

We built a second floor and a roof guest room last year and they did a horrible job!!
Sterling builder group has been consistent for the start. Have a great sense of business and all the flaws were fixed within the first month.
Very happy with the work they have done for us... will hire them again!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>We met Denny about three months ago and we were attracted when he described his work with house remodeling . He was able to factually drawing his thoughts in the air ..his design and ethics matched our expectations.
The kitchen was completed on time and within the budget .
In summary I am pleased with both the process and the results , the quoted price was the price we paid .
I would definitely recommend them for design and construction work .</Review>< pics>

The results speak for themselves!!

<text>Sterling Builders came in, measured our yard, and we picked the plants and gravel we wanted .The next day Rodrigo, Antony and Carlos showed up early .They leveled the yard, planted the plants, laid the weed barrier and laid the gravel .They did a great job all in one day .They worked in wet misty weather .All three were helpful and friendly
If we decide to lay artificial sod in the back yard later we will call Sterling Builders .We are pleased with their work .</text><Resp>None< /Resp><userid>109978327081373409304<//userid><time>1525790650767< /time>< gmapID>

Sterling has proved to me time and time again that they are number one!!!!
All the information I received from my neighbors about them was true to the last detail!
I wanted to build a second level above my existing house- it was a bit hectic a lot work to be done and above all of that I did an entire roof renovation.
I appreciate their hard work and long hours- been bringing solutions to the table for any problem.<//Review>

I basically wanted to get my kitchen renovated. I was having some issue with the sink and decided why not get a whole new make over for it.  I decided to give Sterling a call because of a referral from my BF's parents. They gave a very high recommendation. So they came out and gave me a quote to fix the sink (i.e NEW sink), install new cabinets, floor tiles, and a new paint job. Needless to say. Got the quote, definitely reasonable for the amount I was asking them to do. When the guys came out to work they were real nice and professional. Even the bf said they were a nice group of guys, very respectful. But the main thing is the Kitchen and how is looks 20x better. We went for a more modern look, super happy don't regret a thing.</Text><date>1488396899427< /date>< rating>

I had a bad experience in the past with a contractor so this time I made sure to do my research ! After looking around for a couple weeks I finally decided to use this company .

Understood exactly what I wanted done to my kitchen . Got it looking better than I ever imagined . You can tell this company has years of experience . Did a great job on the new tile and countertop . Looks and feels a lot more spacious . Thanks again 5 star service !
Ask for Eli he is the best sales guy over there.</Review>

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! One of the MOST UNPROFESSIONAL excuses for customer service I've ever experienced. They don't return calls, then claim they did return them, then they blame the customer and other Sterling staff for not returning calls. They cancel appointments at the last minute, then like before they blame the customer and other staff for this. They mix-up customer addresses, phone numbers, and project information. We have a 4-month, $120,000+ home remodel project that Sterling claimed they had the expertise to handle as a general contractor, but when they can't even handle simple administrative tasks without this level of drama there's NO WAY I'd ever hire them. We're thankful that we discovered Sterling's true nature at the start of the project instead of half-way through.</text>

<Text>At first I was looking for construction companies based on reviews online, but whenever I called I got a bad feeling..
I decided to ask my friends and heard about sterling builders group from a friend of a friend that used them last year.
I called first thing in the morning and was greeted by the manager himself!
I spoke with them more a couple of times in emails and decided how I want my kitchen to look like.

Nimi was a true professional, went straight to the point without trying to milk extra charges from me-
The kitchen remodeling went according to the plan, every step was finished on time.
Nimi doesnt waste his time around talking, he goes straight to work from day one.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

The building we have has 80 steps from the ground floor to the apartment , so I wanted a good company and did not want to be in a situation where they would get discouraged with all the steps .
We were in a middle of heat wave and these guys are hustling up the stairs with Smile on their face .
We chsnged our floors they were honest reliable and quick .
Highly recomend this company .<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<Response>None</Response><Review>DO NOT TRUST THIS SCAM.  DO NOT GIVE A Downpayment.  This company is so unresponsive, pases the buck, not answering their phone.  I think it's not a real company, but are a big SCAM.  Be careful.  My next step is to contact the BBB and any agency that can help me get my $1,000 down payment back.  The don't answer the phones, they don't return calls or text messages.  They have left me NOT knowing what is going on.   They took my money and dropped off the face of the earth.  I think I've been robbed.   Do not use this company.  I don't even think it's real!   So far, just liars and cheaters.  I there were zero stars, then that's what they would get.   Again, this company may not be real.<//Review>< Rate>

It's been nothing but trouble with these people who like to Jack up the initial estimates and now are trying to get us to agree to the job by trying to make us drive all the way to their  office in L.A.  to pick up our deposit.
Avoid them like the plague.< /Review>

I called Jesse for a quote on a rock chip and he was super kind and friendly. He was also very attentive and accommodating, so much my appointment was offered for the same or next day. Thank you! Jesse was also good about communicating and kept me updated on his arrival. The best part, he was willing to come to my home to make the repair, which was extremely helpful to me. Thank you Jesse for all your help, kindness, and your professionalism. I highly recommended Jesse for anyone out there looking for a repair or replacement.<//Review>

Jesse showed up on time.
Nice guy, looking and carrying himself professionally…!
We had a large chip with spider cracks, centered directly in driver’s range of sight.
When he finished, about 45 minutes later,
the chip and cracks were hardly noticeable.
I recommend him to anyone looking for great service at a fair price…
BTW, he also included a “money back” guarantee!!!</Review>

We spent a week in Palm Desert and unfortunately, got a ding in our windshield driving over here. I wanted to fix it before continuing our road trip and risking it getting worse. Called Jesse and he was able to come to our time share in about an hour. He was friendly, professional, and did a great job at a reasonable price! He answered all my questions honestly and without hesitation. I had checked the larger national brand first and they wanted to charge more than twice the price. I highly recommend Desert Windshield Repair.<//Text>

The service Jesse provided was outstanding! He was professional, honest and just a real cool dude; very genuine. I called him early Saturday morning and he showed up that afternoon to do the job. My BMW had a 6 inch crack  (most places would try to replace the windshield/up sell), Jesse worked his magic and the crack disappeared. He's like a surgeon for your windshield. CALL HIM NOW!! Great job Jesse!! 10/10!!< /review>

We were on a long road trip and were struck by two rocks on the freeway leaving two chips in our windshield on a Sunday morning.  Everything else was closed.  Jesse met us in the parking lot of a local business and fixed us up in less than half an hour.  He did a great job and was very reasonable.<//text>

Jesse did a great job. I had a rock chip on my windshield and he repaired it.  Almost not noticeable now. And it only took 15 min to do it.</Text>

Small half inch crack on windshield. I knew it would spread quickly. Called Jesse on Sunday morning. He showed up within 2 hours and repaired the issue in 30 minutes. He knew exactly what to do! Can’t even see the damaged area. Fast, efficient, skillful, and a very very good price! Not only that, but he’s just a really good person and I like supporting a local business. If I had gone to Safelite ( who are very good), it would have cost double and I would have driven to their shop on Monday morning. Jesse can provide full service if needed, but we hope we’ll never need that. Living in the desert, we never know. Thank you!< /review>

In this day and age, where everyone is in a hurry and/or busy, it's nice that somebody still does business like a gentleman. Jesse just finished doing a fantastic repair on my rock-chipped windshield, and I'm nothing less than ecstatic at the quality of work and level of service. I can see why Jesse has over 80 5-star ratings on Google.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this business.< /Review>

This was my first experience repairing a cracked windshield and I was completely satisfied with the experience and the finished result. My appt. was right on time and the process didn’t take long either. I was nervous about how it would turn out but the outcome exceeded my expectations. The repairman, Jesse,  left my windshield looking almost close to the pre-crack version before my accident. Most importantly he provided excellent customer service, which is important to me as someone who pays attention to service experience. He did an awesome job!</Text>

We were visiting from out of town and we went to Joshua Tree which was great.   Not so great was we got a rock chip from gravel on the roads.  Back to great - Jesse was awesome and showed up very quickly after we called him.  He was careful, methodical, and performed a great repair for a super fair price. (He also gave us great advice of what to visit while in town)  HIGHLY recommended!<//Review>

Jesse fixed my windshield crack and saved me having to purchase a new windshield. Great value for $65! He was professional and courteous. I recommend this company to anyone. Nice to have the  work done in my driveway.<//Text>

He explained that the chip was fully sealed and cured and that if anything happened he would come back and fix it and that he had a money back guarantee. I will definitely use Desert Windshield repair again and will recommend to people I know.<//Review>< Pictures>

He is professional and delivers what he promises.  Would definitely use him again if necessary or recommend him to anyone needing this service.  Also reasonable prices.  Thanks Jesse!!</review>< Rating>

Jesse came out and fixed a chip in my windshield. I have two other chips that were previously repaired out of state by another company and his repair looks about 100 times better than the other two that I’ve had. I can barely even tell there was ever a crack. Amazing. Highly recommended!

Thank you, Jesse!</Review>

I had a small 1” crack in my windshield and a number of other “dings” to be dealt with. I found Desert Windshield Repair on Google. I was so impressed with the reviews and decided to give them a call. Jesse lives up to the hype! He arrived promptly for our scheduled appointment, was very professional, and incredibly friendly. My windshield looks great! It was definitely a five-star experience based on professionalism, product, and price. I would not hesitate to use them again. Highly recommend! Thank you Jesse!</Text>

Jesse was perfect for our rock-chipped window. We are traveling the USA on our way to seeing all 61 National Parks in our diesel Ford PU towing our 31' 5th wheel. We picked up a chip leaving Florida, couldn't make it work from there to Palm Desert. talked to him on Thurs. and Sat. morning at my RV site, he fixed it and even fixed up another chip I'd had 3 years ago . A good job at a fair price.
Nice work Jesse!<//Review>

<Review>I was driving on the 10 freeway and a large rock hit my windshield and caused a pretty large crack on my front windshield. I went on yelp and found Desert Windshield Repair and requested their mobile service.  I am staying in Palm Springs and Jesse came out and repaired my window. The window crack got repaired and the rep was friendly, punctual and did a great job on my car.

The company is highly recommended!</Review>< pics>

<Text>Jesse was awesome!  He took time to explain the process of the repair. I had gone to another company and was told I would have to replace the entire windshield.  I contacted Jesse through internet search and sent him a screenshot of my windshield late one evening.  He is mobile repair so he repaired it the next day.  Desert Windshield Repair provides  great customer service at a reasinable price and my windshield looks good as new thanks to Jesse!!<//Text><time>1578866564417</time>< username>

Jesse came to my home and did an excellent job on two chips on my professional van that I use in my car service.  He was thorough, charged the most competitive price, explained the procedure very well and got me on my way in less than 30 minutes! I have been using this type of service for over 24 years in both my taxi and car service and the fact that he comes to you and does not charge extra for this like other companies is a real bonus! I would definitely recommend Desert Windshield Repair to repair or replace your windshield—absolutely!!< /Review>

Jesse came out to Thermal to repair a chip in the windshield of my vehicle.  While there my daughter asked him if he could fix her windshield as well, and he did.  He also gave us an estimate to replace a windshield in another vehicle.  Jesse showed up at the time given, was extremely pleasant, and represented his company with great professionalism.  We plan to call him in the future for all our vehicle glass repairs/replacements.<//Text>

I am here on vacation and got a chip on the way here (in addition to an already existing chip) and needed it repaired in this heat.  They were really fast, very communicative, and Jesse was super fast.  The windshield looks great and the price was really reasonable!<//text>

A friend of mine suggested I just get the chip repaired, which I didn't know was possible. After some research I came across Desert Windshield repair. Jesse was the person who came to my home and repaired the chip. The results were great and at a great price. I saved a lot of $$. 10/10 would recommend.< /Text>< user>

They destroyed my nails. After three months my nails are still wrecked and it will probably take a year for them to grow back properly. Go somewhere else where they at least know how not to destroy the natural nailbed.<//text>

<Text>The woman cut my skin of my pinky and it kept bleeding forever. They didn't honor a groupon over the phone that the owner said was okay, reminded in person, still didn't honor it. The first color of nails was so poorly done it looked like something i could have done myself (I'm horrible painting nails), you could see uneven lines, smudges, gunk under the fake nails, the sanding was uneven so my nails liked bumpy, AND I KEPT BLEEDING. the girl had the nerve to ask me if i have a bleeding problem. No. No i don't.

I felt like i was treated like i was a subpar human. I saw a group of Caucasian ladies and Caucasian older women, they were all pampered and cared for, their nails looked great. I was even told to move to another chair because she wanted to help "her customer" there, like i wasn't first? Like i wasn't important? I felt so small, and the service really me feel that way.

Please avoid this place.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>Nice staff, but unfortunately not good work. The nail tech put on a set of acrylics, the nails were like potato chips, thin in spots, thick in others. Went back to get fixed the next day. They admitted the nails looked bad. They charged me full price and the second set was not good either. Tried two times. 5 out of ten nails lifted after one week. I haven't had nails lift in decades! NO excuse. Done spending time and money there.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Poor customer service very very terrible do not go here.

*update * I’m going to elaborate now about a few months later. I went in and called ahead telling them I wanted a mani pedi for me and my boyfriend. He ended up walking out to get food because they COMPLETELY IGNORED HIM.  Other regular customers took priority, and that’s honestly a good way to piss me off. ALL CUSTOMERS ARE EQUAL. So keep your regulars because I will never be coming back. To any one considering trying this salon, don’t because you will be put on the back burner. POOR POOR  job at creating customer loyalty.< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Rude, really bad customer service if I could give 0 stars I would. I called to ask about the groupon but initially started off by just asking about prices without saying I had a groupon and they were ok with me doing a walk in, once I told them I had a groupon the lady said “oh I’m sorry we are booked today can you come tomorrow” I told them I would call tomorrow and schedule the appointment then. (Was not going too because it was clear that they did not want to attend me today bc of the discount Groupon was offering. About 5 minutes later I get a call from the same number and the lady says “hi you call this morning for appointment we have an appointment available” I said oh great I’ll make it, is my Groupon still ok? She said oh I’m sorry u called a few
Minutes ago? I said yes? She said oh no sorry we called you by mistake. So I asked her if they were calling so
Done back for an available appointment why wasn’t I able to get an appointment and she giggled and hung up on me. I felt that was very rude and I was minimize bc I had a discount. I have never been here but given the fact that this happen before even going I’m glad I will not be wasting my money here.</Review>

They do full face Threading here. I got a Groupon deal for 3 of them and they are SOOOO thorough! I think regular price for a full face thread is ~$30, which is totally worth it compared to the rest of overpriced LA. This will be my go to!</text>

Do NOT GO HERE

they have done a terrible job and the staff and especially store owner was terribly rude.

Instead of the $33 mani and pedi deal they charged $55 to correct THEIR mistakes.

They caused my friends fingers to bleed, didn't fully clean the nail and got annoyed at an understandable complaint.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE

I have pictures of the bloody fingers, and poor poor work< /text>

Bad customer service! My gel nails didn't last 2 days! The owner said she would fix them and made an appointment where I was waiting for 35min to tell me she couldn't fix my nails that day. She told me to come in the next day, I called and she said she didn't have time.   I asked for a refund, she said she doesn't give refunds. She then blamed me for her bad job stating I picked the gel polish off myself and that she has thousands of customers who never complained before. I highly recommend finding a better place with more professionalism.  No stars here....< /text>

DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!! THEY DO A PIECE OF SHIT JOB AND OVER CHARGE YOU. I WOULD GIVE NO STARS IF I WAS ABLE TO!

They do not do a good job at painting nails and the nail polish comes off fast. They cut my friends skin while they did her manicure. Save your money and time, go somewhere else👎👎👎👎👎👎👎<//review>

Threading was okay job.
Mani/Pedi was about the equivalent of a $20 service in the "hood". Got a groupon for $30 but it says they charge $50.

On top of that they "clean" pedicure basins with dish soap. Not very sanitary. Basin they put me in had floaties. Had them move me but they moved me to a basin another customer got up from and I didn't see them clean it.<//review>

Tammy was the person to service me and she wasn't friendly. I had appointment and she acted like she couldn't find my name. I was put in a spa chair and water was ran. Then I had to request the therapy solution. My feet when finish look like they hadn't been scrub because she scrub them with just water so once they dried l showed it to her and she told me I had to pay extra for the callous removed. I purchased a groupon that was the deluxe manicure and pedicure with a value of $50 and I got worst than my hood $23 service.  I won't recommend this place to anyone</Review>

Purchased a Living Social deal, all was great with Tiffany as my nail tech. She is the best howeverd, when making my next appointment adding a service awas not what I expected  at all for such a nice place.
I was stuck in traffic and decided to send a courtesy text, informing them that I would be a few minutes late because of the LA traffic and there was no place to park. I received a text immediately and they stated that I will have to pay for the missed servicee before I can reschedule and/or for being late. I have never been told this before from any other nail salon.
I am very disappointed and unhappy with the wasy I was treated.
Being a Hair Salon owner myself, I would never treat clients this way, especially a new client.

Never again will I return here.....Very unprofessional establishment...

Never coming back to this place!!! It was the first and last time. I went today for a Wax and it was the worst experience ever. First of all, the place is dirty for that type of service, they don't clean you after they're done. My appointment was at 5 pm and they came out at 5:20, it was very painful, and it's not the first time I do this, I told the lady to stop and she kept doing it. I latterly push her hand to make her stop. It was a waist of time and money, and my skin looks horrible it's all irritated.<//Text>

Owner makes appointments for her 2 nails techs and double books them and does not inform them of what appointment is for. They wanted to pause my appointment to accommodate another guest who had called in only moments before. Had a Groupon for manicure only, felt pedicure was over priced to make up for the Groupon discount. While doing the manicure with the dremel tool, she got my skin a few times. Not sure she knew how to use it? Didn't seem to have the tools other salons do either. They need more help and more professionalism. Will not be back.<//review>

<text>Amazing place and great views at the end. The hike is pretty intense, but the view at the end makes it worth it. Overall it's about 10 miles and the last leg is extremely tough, but view from the top makes it worth it!<//text>< Time>

<review>You can get to Black Mountain after you reach the "end" of the PGE trail in Rancho San Antonio. It is a difficult hike, do not attempt if you are not used to using 3000 calories on hikes. Especially considering PGE itself may have wiped you out. Spectacular views once you get Black Mountain. TAKE WATER, there is no water on the way.< /review>< pics>

<Text>Perfect for trail run but parking is horrible. I park a mile away and run from there to avoid the frustration of not getting a parking spot. I actually like that better, because I can add a total of 2 miles on my run. It is a really lovely place to run; we usually run on Woods Trail, Umumhum, Santa Teresa, and Quicksiver. This is one of my of my favorite runs when I can do it :) There are plenty of trails so it's easy to decide if you want a long one or a short one, tough or easy. There are also nice restroom facilities which is a plus as not all Open Space Reserves have restroom facilities. If you haven't checked it out, do it, you won't be disappointed. I gave it a 4 star because of the parking issue...< /Text>< Pictures>

Great business! Communicates ETA, and sticks to it! Very knowledgeable and informative about products. Friendly drivers. Personable owner. I have tried a lot of companies in the Bay Area to make sure I find the best one for me. I kept coming back here, and have decided to stop trying others because none of them could compare. I highly recommend.</Review>

<review>LOVE Euphorium ✨. They are the BEST East Bay cannabis delivery option without question. Their menu is well curated, with lots of options for all types of needs and interests. My experience has always been super effortless and enjoyable. The owner is so awesome, very invested, and seems to treat her employees well. They are always so positive and happy to help with questions. Really can’t say enough!<//review><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808f8553c390798f:0x2e764e451d7f5be6< /Gmap_id>< Pics>

This is my favorite cannabis delivery experience in the Bay Area. I have looked at other options and wasn't impressed. Euphorium has a great selection and exceptional customer service. The new website looks great and it very easy to use. Thank you!<//Review>

<review>Euphorium is the best! Since I found out about them I never order from anywhere else. They have a great selection, great prices and delivery is amazingly fast. Plus they’re super nice and I feel so much better ordering from a small family business rather than a big company.

The only delivery service I use! I've been a customer for years and they are absolutely the best! Professional. Timely. Friendly. They keep you updated on every part of the process. Always a great selection of items to choose from. Vegan options as well! I cannot recommend them enough. Thank you for making each delivery special!!< /text>

I❤️  Euphorium! They have a great selection of edibles, etc. and they are very professional while still being friendly and down to earth. It's a nice combination.
Delivery is very dependable; It's so easy to order, too. Look no further!< /text>

The greatest delivery in town. Every time I call they are super friendly and helpful, plus the drivers are hella quik. I'd like some left coast extracts pods here too besides the fact u can always get the dank bud here. #1 imo.</Text>

Euphorium has been my go-to delivery service for a long time. The quality of customer service is refreshing. Tee Tee is knowledgeable and fantastic at suggesting the right product for my desired affect. I love that it’s a family business. The delivery drivers are friendly and professional. The sales and promotions are fantastic.<//review>

<Review>As an avid user since 2010, it is always helpful when this beautiful plant can be delivered to your front door. Kind of like the show High Maintenance,  but without the cameras, actors and kooky situations. They are accurate and deliver a great product. As I am writing this, a cloud of Durban Poison is filling up the air. Please use this service and support the cause of justifying eating a pint of ice cream.</Review>< pics>

<Text>Euphorium is hands down the best weed delivery service I use. They are reliable, always have what me and my family needs. They care about community and go out of their way to make sure you’re treated with a lot of care. They checked in with me about pronouns and I felt respected and seen which I am grateful for!
Wonderful products, wonderful humans, wonderful service!</Text><userid>113986301388889101074<//userid></record>

Amazing rewards program! I've been a consistent customer for over 3 years and won't go anywhere else. I can usually get a free edible or cartridge with my order.

Great selection of flowers and edibles and they can always recommend a replacement if something is out of stock. Delivery times are consistent, and multiple forms of payment are supported.</Review>

Euphorium is my go-to spot for flowers, edibles, topicals, pretty much everything. They always have a huge variety in stock, reasonable prices, and lots of specials. Their communication is super quick/clear and delivery is always smooth and discreet. Love Euphorium!!</review>

The edible selection at Euphorium is unmatched in the East Bay and the online ordering experience is so easy. Did I mention they have free same day delivery and a team always willing to answer any questions? You have to give them a try. Euphorium is now our go to.< /review>

< Review>
We love ordering from Euphorium. They’re consistent, on time, good communication. They have the widest variety of high CBD edibles I’ve seen on the various cannabis delivery retailers. Which is great for me I can’t handle too much thc. But they also have plenty of thc goodies for my spouse so we don’t need to order stuff from two different places. The folks there are super nice and great with recommendations. We basically only order from them now!<//Review>

The ONLY delivery service I use! Charlita and her staff are always super helpful with answering questions and recommendations.  They have a great reward system and superior product on all levels.  It's also comforting to know that during this uncertain time,  Euphorium offers sterile drop off.</Review>

Euphorium in Oakland is hands down the best choice for cannabis in the East Bay. Their menu is unlike any I've seen in the Bay Area, very carefully chosen products and experiences. The staff is so loving and attentive, offering that mom and pop experience you don't get anywhere any more. The service is consistent and timely, and they take really good care of their customers -- they have the best promotions once you sign up.<//review>

<text>Euphorium Oakland is by far the best in the Bay Area. Their customer service is unparalleled - they are always extremely responsive and accommodating. They have very high quality products and a huge variety of everything that those of us in search for cannabis products could ask for. I have been a loyal customer for a long time and each and every time I have been more than satisfied with their quality, speed, friendliness, and attention to detail. I HIGHLY recommend them. They have the best selection of Pax Era pods I have seen. You will not be disappointed.</text><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

Euphorium is really a diamond in the rough and is the ONLY delivery service that I will patron. On top of having only the highest quality flowers from reputable growers (fureals some of the best I've ever had, and I grew up in the bay, most of these delivery services be frontin), prompt service, and friendly drivers (a lot of these delivery services send weirdos to your door who want to chat about the weirdest things and won't leave), euphorium is also a POC woman owned business, which is important for me when choosing establishments to support.< /text>

This pier is popular with recreational fishermen?
People also like to go to the adjacent beach and surf or just run along it.<//Review>

< Review>
This a great place to visit and get in a good walk at the same time. There are people teaching their children how to fish and sometimes the children catch a fish before their parents do. The atmosphere is very calming and sometimes I have bread to toss to the seagulls. I believe more fish are caught during the day as opposed to the evening, but there seems to be a consistent  group of people who fish late at night.< /Review>

We drove for a few hours to get to Cabrillo Beach, but it was worth it. The beach was clean and the kid's playground was in really good condition. The restrooms were clean and it has soap to wash your hands. We walk on the beach and collected a few beautiful rocks that have fossil on shields. It has some benches to sit on with an amazing view.<//Review>

<Text>This place is great for fishing. It can get busy and a little crowded but it's always fun. It has a pretty long pier and parking is not to expensive. We usually catch fish every time we go out. Mostly mackerel bit a few other species too. If it's not mackerel then more than likely you're going to have to throw back whatever you catch. They're not the healthiest to eat but there is some good fish out there too that you can definitely take home and cook for dinner. And if you go on a Sunday evening you can watch the cruise ship leave.< /Text>< Pics>

This place is great for fishing. It can get busy and a little crowded but it's always fun. It has a pretty long pier and parking is not to expensive. We usually catch fish every time we go out. Mostly mackerel bit a few other species too. If it's not mackerel then more than likely you're going to have to throw back whatever you catch. They're not the healthiest to eat but there is some good fish out there too that you can definitely take home and cook for dinner. And if you go on a Sunday evening you can watch the cruise ship leave.<//review>

< Review>
The pier has throngs of visitors who lack respect and common sense. The facilities are disgusting and unhygienic. The lifeguard towers are decaying; the county should invest in better facilities for their employees, as they work very hard and deserve better. Don't go here if you want to avoid COVID-19: no one wears a mask here.<//Review>

<Review>I luv this local gem of a beach. Someplace to go for a quiet moment to give your troubles to the sea. A nice place to take friends, family & lovers to create memories around a blazing fire pit. A magnificent open secret at the edge of L.A. with enchanting views in every direction. Worth the drive for a day trip.</Review>< gmapID>

Really big pier.. room for lots of fishing. Doesn't get crowded like Redondo and or Santa Monica. And parking isn't a headache.<//text>

< Review>
I luv this local gem of a beach. Someplace to go for a quiet moment to give your troubles to the sea. A nice place to take friends, family & lovers to create memories around a blazing fire pit. A magnificent open secret at the edge of L.A. with enchanting views in every direction. Worth the drive for a day trip.<//Review>

<review>Love it down here... But a little advise... Most of the  parking meters or pay stations are supposed to take cash, but they don't or won't cause not working.... So bring your debit or credit card... They do accept those still...  Lol         great spot though... Aquarium /museum is located near by and the beaches are easily accessible.< /review>< Pictures>

Going for a walk 🚶 is so relaxing, you could choose between two sides of the beach 🌴one you could see the boats 🚢 and the other one has a better scenery 🐬  and it has a pier where you could go fishing 🎣.<//Text>

This beach is decent, but not the best , parking is somewhat difficult. It’s super windy which is good sometimes if you like the ocean breeze, the downside , there’s not that much waves water is murky, and there’s tons of seaweed floating around which can be very annoying if your trying to have a good time .< /review>

Always a good place to fish has really good spots and will always be a place for me to chill and have fun. They do charge parking so have that in mind when going. I went last Thursday and caught 4 mackerel fish good descent size too. They are really good deep fried with a bit of salt lemon and tapatio.< /Review>

There is a spot at Cabrillo Beach that I never knew or saw until my friend, Amy took me there. It is at the end of the beach road, you park and walk past the lifeguard tower that is on the right, and walk straight ahead and there beyond the rocks is this sandy area that is like your own  private beach. When it is low tide this spot is exquisite.</review>

This place rocks but depends upon what you're looking for. If you want to go fishing this place is really good. The best time to go fishing is late nights and evenings</Review>

<pics>None<//pics><text>We maybe go 2-3 times a week. My borfriend on the other hand "lives there". I enjoy going because they have a beach side that has no waves. Theres a kids playground. An aquarium in the same location.
I would give it 5 stars but the restrooms are always an issue with me. Its says they won't close until 10 but when I go to both (by the playgrounds) they are 93% of the time closed. Ive walked by around 4pm and their closed.. Oh but not the mens.!! Women have bladders too.!!!! 😒👊</text></record>

The water is so ugly and filthy that there is no way that I would eat whatever I caught of that dirty water. I was simply toss the fish back in don't want it don't need it in that case I would rather go fishing elsewhere. If you have nothing to do and you want to stare at a dirty ocean come here stare at the people stare at the fish you catch cuz that's all you want to do here the water is so dirty. The location is ugly I don't like it I'm not a fan of this place at all. I don't want to return here anytime soon.</text>< user_id>

<review>You can catch just about anything here. Bass, barracuda, different perch, sculpin, and many different sharks. You can occasionally see a sea lion and her pup or a pod of dolphins with their young or maybe if you're lucky, you'll get a close encounter with a whale calf like I did today.</review><Name>William Luevano<//Name>< Resp>

Good for taking a walk.  Not so good for fishing though since there are so few fish there and you do not want to consume any fish you caught here.  The place looks down since last oil spill years ago.<//review>

Because it is rougher than the jetty with the Takamatsu red lighthouse
I could feel the sea a little scary because of the high waves.
You can only enter the car halfway (there is a car stop)
