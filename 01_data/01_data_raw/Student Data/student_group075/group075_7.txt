They put all our info on via our time machines so both are ready to go. They also gave useful information to free my computer of unnecessary memory space used.

I came to this guys twice because I have a problem with my MacBook and firstly I came with my MacBook not working and even without looking at it properly or diagnosing it, the guy just told me 550$ and that’s it, without even explaining what is the issues/problem. Then I came at the same day second time with my MacBook because it started to work and asked, can they have a look and tell me the problem, the guy didn’t even look at it and didn’t even listened to me, just said I want to go home and if you want, you can come on Monday.< /text>

Absolutely wonderful customer service! They fixed the fan on my OLD treasured MacBookPro from 2012. They were super nice, fast and very trustworthy. Even called me when it was ready, instead of me having to check in. Will always use them. Lifetime customer. Thank you!</text>

<review>The Mac Guys are fantastic they were able to diagnose my problem real fast about my I-Mac and telling me that it was internal Video card and could not repair it. They were able to find me a solution and purchase another 1 year newer I-Mac instead of spending the money on a new video card, they had me up and running in 2 days so I could finish an on-going important slideshow project. Thank you Mac Guys.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>I am so thankful I found The Mac Guys. I first contacted Apple after reviewing their list of Third Party Certified Apple Tech Support companies and ending up more confused as to where to go for what I believed to be hardware repairs. Within 15 minutes of arriving here, these guys isolated the problem and were able to demonstrate the solution using their own equipment to show me. They also did a quick search on the internet and found a local company that had the part I needed for $98.00. I jotted down the contact information and was then on my way. I will likely contact them again when I am ready to purchase a new Apple Macintosh computer because they are also Certified Apple Resellers. I highly recommend The Mac Guys!<//Review>< user>

Don’t go here expecting Genius Bar level service. Even though they’re listed as a Genius Bar on Apple’s reservation website (they should probably have themselves taken off apple’s site for making reservations). I’ve had much better experiences at actual apple stores.<//Review>

<text>Knowledgeable and Reasonable. They quoted me $90 but only charged me $50. Said it would take up to 3 days, but did the repair on the spot so I wouldn't have to make a second trip. Hard to find ethics like that in today's business world. Highly recommend to anyone need repair on a Mac. They also sell the same products you find in the Apple Store.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Very helpful techs when I had a hardware issue. Discussed the options over the phone with me and when I brought the iMac in, what they said would happen, was done at the price quoted and in the time frame they said. Quicker and easier than going to the "genius" bar.<//text>

Best service EVER.  Took my 9 year old IMac with a crashed HD in on Monday.  Luckily I had my Time Machine back up (which actually worked). Got my computer back on Wed.  Everything was exactly how it was before the crash!  Apple wouldn't even talk to me, because my machine was too old. Thank you Mike!< /Review>

<Text>My iMac blew up in a power surge, and nothing I did would turn it on. Fortunately, it just needed to be unplugged for 12+ hours (drain the SMC of extra voltage, before being able to start again). After they told me that, they didn't charge me a dime! They had my computer overnight and even ran diagnostic tests, gave me some tips on my filesystem and sent me out the door with my computer working great! THAT is awesome customer service. Thank you so much!!!</Text>< pictures>

These guys are really great!!! Took my MacBook Pro in when he USB-c ports stoped functioning. Apple Support told me that I would have to bring it in for repair and that it may take up to a week to get it back. The Mac Guys initially told me the same thing but not a hour later called to tell me my computer was fixed that he was able to get it going. Turns out it was not a hardware issue just needed to be reset. Something the Apple Support rep didn't even suggest I try.

They also have any Mac accessory you might need and all the products you would find at an Apple Store with no long waits or insane crowds. 10/10 for The Mac Guys<//Review>

I love the Mac Guys. I've been going here for a really long time.

UPDATE: Another great experience. These guys are the best! I avoid the Apple Store as much as possible for problems with my many Macs. Hauling a 27” iMac through the just isn’t fun. That and having to schedule an appointment with the Apple store is enough to keep me away.

Thank goodness for the Mac Guys where I can walk in and get service right away. They were able to get my iMac back to me the same day! I’m so happy.

They always carry my iMac out to my car for me. They are knowledgeable and expert trouble shooters. There’s nobody better.< /Text>

After a Mavericks install disaster and evidently a MacBook Pro hardware fail, these gentlemen first offered advice on what to do on my own before they would take my computer.  Turns out I need to deal with Apple directly and they told me up front that for my problems it might cost less to do it that way.  The brief time they took to help me (and for any small business, TIME is MONEY) was no charge and their advice was correct.  So if you visit them, don't be a time hog and please be mindful of their need to work efficiently.  They are very up front about the problems and possible costs of repair and no need to book an appointment days in advance.  Apple was happy I went to them as an Authorized Facility, too.  Next time I have a problem not under warranty or in need of other Apple/Mac products, I will be back!</text>

These guys are the BEST!  I have been an Apple fan for over 25 years and the Genius Bar at Apple Store is a total joke.  Its one thing to have the Mac sent to Apple for repairs and it is another to have it done in the AppleStore.  Forget it.  MacGuys are terrific.  They take good care of their customers and they are very fast.  I will go to AppleStore to shop but for repairs and/or customization are on top of my list!  Eric<//review>

Just call and ask a question about services or pricing, I've done it twice. It’s like talking a crabby millennial in their mom’s basement.

Really disappointing. Called in for a quote for repair and the guy was very blunt and rude. Not to mention the quote for a screen replacement was two times what I had gotten from 2 other companies. Rubbed me the wrong way.< /Review>

I couldn't b happier with Dad and Sons!! Honest Trustworthy Respectful these men have true Integrity on top of being great mechanics!! Kevin gives me and my special needs son a ride home when I drop my truck off and picks us up. He is always patient and understanding with us but after hearing about how his father came to having their business I wouldn't expect anything less. My truck runs great at a very affordable price!!

This place was awesome!! Very friendly young man named James helped us out. We took my husbands truck in to get a water pump changed. James was super friendly and very very smart. He took the time to explain a lot of things to us and when the job was done he even showed us the broken parts. They literally got the job done in 1 day!!! As promised!!! No hidden fees no over charging!! We will be getting all our work done at this place from now on. We were very impressed by dad and sons!! I highly recommend this place. It was recommended to me by a friend and she was right they are nice and professional. It’s nice to know there are still honest shops out there. We were so stressed out about trying to find a good place and now we know we have found one. When or if we need more work done we will definitely get it done here. Thank you so much for the great experience<//Text>

I have lived in Banning for many years and I never found a shop that is as honest, up front, fair priced and family orientated as this place. And believe me, I  been through the run-of-the-mill of bad mechanics. Thank you so much for taking care of my family guys!</Text>

I was told it would cost me a couple f thousand to fix it. I told David what i needed done David looked at it fixed it and it only cost me $400 he was honest with me and said the part they claimed was almost impossible to find and expensive was available at almost any auto shop and ran about $10 dollars. I was very pleased cause David was honest with me saved me a lot of money.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>Had my transmission go out on the drive to CA from AZ. Dad and sons were so helpful and got me running again in no time. They don’t make you feel like you’re incompetent and explain everything in detail unlike shops I’ve been to in the past. Definitely recommend to anyone who needs work done!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>This place is amazing! I would go out of my way to have any maintenance or any major work done to my car. They are all very knowledgeable and experienced. This is by far the best place I have ever gone to and walked away confident and knowing my car was in good hands. I would recommend them to everyone!!!</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

My 2004 GMC Yukon blew a head gasket on a long trip. these guys quickly diagnosed the problem and covered every detail of this large, complicated repair. They are friendly, skilled, and most importantly honest and trustworthy. Thank you Dad and Sons!<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Resp>None<//Resp><text>I was blessed to accidentally find son James in the store on a Sunday when they were closed. He was there to hook up a computer they had repaired.  I had a part fall down on the front of may car causing a terrible scraping noise on the freeway and had 90 miles to go home. I pulled off the fwy looking for wire ties to secure the dragging piece. I'm a 61 yr old lady and did not look forward to crawling under the car to strap it up. I happened to notice their door open and pulled up. James did not hesitate to pull out the floor jack, take off the hanging part and strap the remaining parts up so as not to drag. What a relief! I then made it safely home. What a gentleman. Reminded me of one of my boys. Thank you so much! Blessings to Dad and Sons!!</text><user_id>109301779699185694546</user_id>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I wanted so badly to give this place more than 2 stars. I was advised that this automotive shop would be great and knowledgeable with the service they provide. I read the reviews online and let them work on my 2005 Acura RSX Type-S. I was clear that the car had been sitting out since Feb 2018 and let them work on it in Dec 2018. The clutch went out and I needed a new battery. They did the work and then I got a call that my engine won't start as it has lost compression. I'm still to this day asking "WHY would you replace a clutch when the engine won't start??? Did you NOT start the car first????" I'm now out $2000 for the repairs and I'm donating the car as I can't come up with $4000 for a new engine. The second star comes from their attempt to find me a new engine. They did look to see if there was a suitable replacement, and I can appreciate that. Sadly, their offer of free tires with the replacement of the engine is not enough to fix my car and they get to keep my $2000 and this not so glowing review...< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>
{'time': 1557349286233, 'text': "Hello, this is James from Dad&Sons. The car was towed in for a no start/ clutch not working issue, you notified us the clutch was not in working order, and that the car was sitting for quite some time hence the no start issue. The first issue we found on your car is that the clutch was bound up, and the clutch pedal was stuck about half way down. Your car is equipped with a clutch safety switch, you have to fully press the clutch pedal down to activate this switch so it will allow the car to turn over to start. Since we couldn't force the pedal down we couldn't start the car, and if we bypassed the switch it would push forward because the clutch wouldn't disengage\n\nSo we went ahead and removed the the transmission to see what failed. We found that the  Throw-out bearing came apart. The clutch disc was down to the rivets, and the flywheel and pressure plate had serve heat spots. This is why we recommended a clutch kit. After replacing those parts we could continue the diagnostic for the no start, which the battery was no good, so we tried to charge it over night and it wouldn't hold a charge. So we installed a new battery. After failed attempts of starting it we went back to the basics and did a compression test, found that ALL 4 cylinders had 0psi. It would take further tear down to figure out why it has 0 compression.\n\nWe did try and find you a used engine, but they are quite pricey for your car, you have the type S which is the k20z1 a 2005-2006 only year engine. Which has a different cylinder head and camshafts than the base model cars 2.0L. We did feel bad, thats why we offered the tires if you did the engine, since those were so bald they were basically racing slicks. It wasnt something we wanted to call and tell you, but it was out of our hands.."}</response>

I wanted to give Dad & Sons Auto 5 stars just for being the first repair shop for returning my call this morning. Even though they didnt repair my car, they were the first repair shop that actually called me back after leaving over 10 messages for other repair shops on a Sunday looking to repair my car that broke down late on a Saturday night< /review>

Jim and his son`s are Very Honest, Very Professional, they are the only mechanics that repair our vehicles. We know when we take our company truck in for repairs we know we are not going to be ripped off like so many other automotive shops have tried to do in the pass years. They go beyond for our charity excellent customer service.< /review>

My "Check Engine" light was on, but I thought I would try and make it home. No such luck. Thank God, I landed at Dad & Sons Automotive !!!  Jim and his sons checked my car for free to determine what was wrong.  The job was going to be a couple hundred dollars and I didn't have $ on me.  I needed to get home to my kids and figure out a game plan to come up with the $. I called Greyhound bus to see about bus travel, but.... GET THIS...... Jim (Dad) says "DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME". We pulled everything valuable from my truck (about 4 suitcases full of stuff) and he drove me 138 miles home (3 hours with traffic) !!!!!  And then he drove himself back home!  This kind of humanity is rarely seen anymore. We had deep conversations about life on our journey. I am struggling - he knew it - and he counseled me on the way home on how to better myself. Jim is a great man ! I'm speechless. MIKE< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Claudia and Naomi were amazing. They styled my daughters' hair for a wedding.  The styles were age appropriate for my 8 and 12 year old. I loved it!< /Text>

Come for a Mens  barber cut and it's a great cut everytime. Look for this place anytime I'm scheduled out here since I live in Orange County. The owner and staff our very welcoming and the place is very nice and clean.< /text>

<text>I've gone here a few times before for myself and always get my hair cut by one specific person and I'm happy every time. the staff is very friendly but.... I took my sons in yesterday and the lady that does my hair cut my oldest and came out great but my youngest had his hair cut by the older lady and ended up looking all butchered up. It's horrible!! A complete disaster she clearly has no idea what she's doing. I'm very disappointed<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Worst salon ever, got my hair cut 6 months ago got home and my hair was longer on one side then the other by 2 inches. My hair had uneven layers all over they weren’t even blended in. I gave up and went to someone else, I was not going to let them touch it again. Then my mother in law went in last week because she saw great reviews and again they left her hair misshaped and her hair is completely short. She ended up racing to Moreno Valley to her old stylist to fix it. The stylist couldn’t believe they left her like this, the reason I always recommend  everyone to make sure they dry your hair before you leave. Otherwise you can’t see the mistakes. I don’t know how they have such a high rating, I truly believe they give these ratings to themselves, just stay away.< /text>

The issue is the guy at the counter that has an attitude and over charges you if your not paying attention (no punt intended). He is very rude and unprofessional. I do not recommend this place to anyone.</review>

I have never felt so ripped off and butcher in my life. The woman who waxed my eyebrows butchered them and then told me they were like that already. She cant wax eyebrows to save her life. I didnt know but now you do. I wish there was a negative star option for this. If you want to leave worse than when you got there, this is the spot.</text>

(Translated by Google) We are very satisfied with Claudia's work. My husband and I always come to his salon for haircuts or hair dyeing and he treats us with great kindness, professionalism and the prices are fair. Even my sons, daughters-in-law and grandchildren are his clients for many years just like us. Thank you Claudia for being a good stylist. God bless her. Her salon is very clean and she is following the covid-19 protocols, everything is very neat and does her job very clean. I recommend it to anyone. For me 5 stars

(Original)
Nosotros nos sentimos muy satisfechos con el trabajo de Claudia. Mi esposo y yo siempre venimos a su salón para cortes de cabello, o tintes de cabello y nos trata con mucha amabilidad, profesionalismo y los precios son justos. Incluso mis hijos, nueras y nietos son clientes suyos por muchos años igual que nosotros. Gracias Claudia por ser una buena estilista. Dios la bendiga. Su salón es muy limpio y ella está siguiendo los protocolos del covid-19, todo muy ordenado y hace su trabajo muy limpio. Se la recomiendo a cualquier persona. Para mi 5 estrellas<//Review>

Beautiful space and lovely views. A variety of hiking trails, and it’s easy to physically distance and find solace. It can be warm, so be sure to bring plenty of water.< /Text>

One of the few native grasslands in the area and chumash land. Go for a nice hike, and, if you're lucky, you'll catch the sheep and lambs restoring the native grasslands by eating invasive grass.< /review>

This is one of my favorite off the grid hiking trails. Nice open land just like the land originally used to be before the Spanish came and colonized the area. Open fields with beautiful trees in the valleys.< /Review>

Good trails and in close proximity to town.  You can walk and walk and walk and walk...

Incredible views.  I'd even call them VISTAS.  I mean, people come and PAINT them-with easels and everything!

Beautiful hills (I want to say they remind me of the Tuscan Hills,  but I don't know).  I just know it's a beautiful view.  And then turn around?  And you've got the Channel-and on clear days, sometimes you can actually even SEE it!  Hahahahaha.

But seriously-beautiful scenic views.  Nature at some of her finest.</Text>

<text>Very impressed with the store.  Staff was very helpful.  I came in for the Rip Curl swim trunks.   Fabric is amazing, comfortable, slightly stretchy, and the fit is perfect.  They almost dry off before you do.  They tie easily and the strings stay tied.  Little things mean a lot.  That's all I have shopped for yet, but I will be going back very soon to check out the T-shirts and casual shirts they have as well.  Very decent prices and sizeable selection.< /text>< time>

I've been in many surf shops and skate shops, RipCurl outlet is perfect for anyone needing everything all in one store... They prices are just right and not over the top like other surf shops that are trying to pay for utilities and cost of operation because they are located right in front of the beach or inside the mall... This is the best store to find everything in one place, the selection is on the spot and very roomy and clean floors. Staff are always helpful and the store manage is super nice. If you hear otherwise, then that individual is just a hater (LoL)... Anyway, happy shopping to all and don't forget to head out to Laguna - Newport - HB Surf City - and - Seal Beach : )<//Text>

I wish I could remember their names; but I recently purchased a watch at Rip Curl Sample sale and I was having problems getting it set up.  I walked in and first a young lady offered to help.  She didn't have experience in the type of watch I had but she was very nice.  She got a coworker to help me and he was able to set up my watch; and if it didn't function again he referred me to service center.  Very friendly employees.  Sorry I didn't get names..< /text>

I've been coming here for years and the service from everyone is so friendly every time.The food is great, but the reason I keep returning all these times is the salsa. I'm hispanic my family gets down with the salsa but the salsa they make here is SO good and it's perfect for chips.</Text>

<review>The food is great.  The quality of service can swing from great to okay, depending on who is working.  They did go through a rough patch in my book, but I think they are trying hard to turn the service around.  But the food is always good.< /review>< userid>

Today I was working around the area and I wanted to have some Mexican Food but not fast food, as I was driving by I saw the little restaurant just off Hawthorne Blvd. and Google & Yelp it and found it to have some great reviews so just this place a try. I was so amazed of the quick and fast service they have and I had the best burrito with chips. The food was XXHOT so be careful of the plate, I know that the cook really takes pride in there work why you ask.....the place is very clean, the staff is great and you never have to ask for anything. That is how all restaurants should be.

Thank you for the great services and especially 5 star for the cook who does not get rewarded enough, The food was the BOM.

This restaurant is one of the last dinosaur, clean tasting food. Recipes from scratch! Chicken tortilla soup is out of this world delicious...Devine even lol... the employees are very professional and courteous. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. But I kind of want it for myself my little retreat< /Review>

The food is great, but the service is incompetent. My wife's family introduce the restaurant to my family and friends, but everytime we order on the phone,  our food order is off and once we  get home which is in  Downey is such an inconvenience

We called to let them know of their mistake and  a lady named Kennia offered a courtesy carne asada for the mistake,  but when we called to claimed it, she denied she ever offered the courtesy meal. It is so dishonest to treat a client in such manner, specially if we have attended the place for years, we both thank God have good jobs and are honest and hard working and is not fair to treat us as if we were free loaders.</review>

This restaurant has terrible service and manners. My husband who is a disable VET and I were told never come back because he had a service dog that they disliked being in the restaurant. What a total disgrace to do that to a disable VET that served our county.< /text>

<Text>I like their cookie dough with pretzel  Icecream. That is the only flavor I love. Their choices are limited and they claim their flavours are seasonal because they use fresh fruits based on the season. However I have been going their for almost two years but always have the same flavors. So I don't believe that. Their  quality of ice cream and the fresh baked  waffel cone which I get with the pretzel Icecream is really good. But  From my last couple of visits I am seeing variations in quality of ice creams. It used to be frozen really good and now it's more like melted and taste got also declined . But I am still giving them four stars for my past good experiences for two years. I hope they keep it consistent.</Text><resp>None< /resp>< username>

Possibly the best ice cream I had in my life. I had the cookie cough, with caramel ice cream. The ice cream is done right in front of you. (You can see the nitrogen tubes.)</review>

They just opened...OK I'll be the first to review. I'm not sure whether to say I am an ice cream fanatic or and ice cream connoisseur. I love ice cream but I won't just eat ANY ice cream. I only want the best. I didn't know that they made ice cream "to order" when I entered. I loved the dairy laboratory looking atmosphere. There is a giant take of liquid nitrogen in the front which is how they freeze your ice cream to order. First I thought...ow wow this is probabably a good gimmick. I don't know if it is the ingredients or the freshness or a combination of the two but it was some of the best ice cream I have ever eaten. The texture was perfect and the vanilla flavor was just the right amount. They had only four flavor that day and I don't know if that it the plan of if they will expand the menu later. The small vanilla cup was $4.75 but it was generous (4) ounces). The pint costs $11. Pricey but worth it. Good luck on the new opening.</Review>

Having a big tank of Nitrogen in the corner and lots of dry ice mist falling over the counter really makes this more interesting.

I wish I'd been able to see this when I was a kid.

Anyway, the ice cream is tasty. There isn't much seating, but customer turnover is pretty fast.< /review>< date>

This is mixed bag for me. I'm giving it a four because the ice cream I ate was delicious. But was it "the freshest" or more delicious than other ice cream that isn't pumped out of the ceiling on demand? In my opinion, no. Because of this high maintenance process they only offer a small handful of flavors at once and the price is very high. To be honest it really did irratate me that you can't taste a thing before purchasing and that they had a sign up for a flavor that hadn't "been ready" all day.
For people who like futuristic tech and very cold ice cream.
Not for people who want some normal ice cream and I wouldn't recommend it for kids.</text>

I have been to the location in SF and this one is just as good AND it's inside! I went with the standard chocolate and it was just as great as I remember it. I don't think you need to say much more about Smitten. They're the best at what they do.<//Text>

This ice cream is expensive but OMG, it is worth it and there will be lines to get it. I enjoyed the chocolate with toasted almonds. This stuff was slow to melt.

1.5 scoops with the almonds was $6.75. That could have bought me a house in Kentucky!</Review>

If you are looking to spend the rest of the night in the bathroom this place is for you. Honestly people, it's ice cream. Bring cold stone back.</text>

You have the opportunity to follow the manufacturing process, which uses liquid nitrogen in the process. A big difference is that the ingredients are from local producers, organic natural milk and seasonal fruits.

I asked for a refund on 2 items I purchased. Only received one refund. I need a refund for my second order, order #18069, it’s been 3 months. This company is a joke.< /Review>

Do not order anything from this place it is literally a scam & if you do be prepared to have your bank dispute the charges. I sent an email regarding my order that I never received any shipping number for or anything and they never responded, they don’t even have a contact number. Don’t waste your money, because there quick to take yours and won’t give you anything in return. Seriously stay away< /text>

<review>ISSUE A REFUND FOR ORDER 18794. I wish I had taken the time to do some research on this place before I placed my order. This place is a scam. They only take your money. Look up their business on SOS.CA.GOV. Their license is suspended and the addresses are fake. Hopefully the Nguyens come to their moral senses and stop scamming people! Issue the refund for 18794.< /review>< Rate>

<Text>I ordered a pair of Megan test pipes (Order #18649) that I, a day later found out they no longer make. I found this out as a previous costumer stated that Megan racing no longer makes these pipes. Instead of waiting till I wouldn’t be able to cancel my order I emailed them to which I have gotten a response confirming the absence of this product, they said they would issue a refund request to the company but it has been nearly two weeks and nothing has happened, recently I received an email that said they were out of stock and asked me if I want a different pair of test pipes indicating to me that this company has yet to do anything about my order and whoever I spoke to first about my order hasn’t done anything to cancel it or try to refund it. So far the newest email sender has yet reply to my request of an order cancelation and a refund. Feels like I’m shouting into a void.-Order #18649</Text>< Pics>

They were a special order since it had to be shipped from Japan. I understand it can take a bit. But there is a serious lack of communication. I have sent email after email asking for some kind of update. Any update. Just any reply. I got one reply in the end of January saying there is a shipment coming in mid february. I waited. Nothing. I send emails, and get no response. Theres phone number to call that has a recorded message telling you to use the chat feature on the website, which is non existent on the site. Theres no other way to get a hold of these people. Seriously, no reason for me to recommend this place. I want my money back or my order fulfilled.

I ordered a trunk from this company if September 4, 2020 and still haven’t received it. They claimed they had it in stock at the time I ordered it. I emailed them, left messages and the message not response I got was that it was being mailed out next week. Nothing came...I’ve now requested a refund and still no response or refund..very disappointed.

<Text>Website has a picture with a Google rating 4 3/4 stars. That cannot be further from the truth. I have no issues waiting on quality parts. The company lacks communication and follow up. I have sent several emails, no response. Wrote a review on FB after reading another customers review. Took his suggestions on using IG, they responded. This was 24 Feb a week goes by and nothing. They posted a story on IG about them being flooded with emails and to use their story to make contact. Did that 1 March. Order was placed in November and on back order until February, all I want is an update on shipping. I do not think that is being unreasonable. Next steps is contacting the BBB. Buyer beware, learn from my mistake. I’m never using this business again!!! Check out the reviews online, maybe 4 years ago they were great, not in recent years.

This isn’t the first time I’ve purchased parts for my car from Outcast and it definitely won’t be my last. Customer service and communication are easily the two most important things for me when buying parts, especially considering the eagerness and anticipation to know how everything is going after you’ve ordered something new!  People need to understand that the a lot of parts are made to order or sometimes come directly from the source and they can only control so much - but what they can control, they definitely take care of efficiently. The Outcast team is super quick when it comes to responses to emails, concerns, questions, etc. They’ve always provided more than exceptional customer service every time I’ve purchased from them and I couldn’t appreciate them and the experience I always have with them enough. Thanks guys!<//review>

<review>ordered a pair of headlights that they claimed to be “in stock” on 7/1/2020. They said it would take 4-6 weeks. It’s been about 14 weeks and no update. Ordered the same headlights from redline360 and received them in 3 days. Been trying to cancel my order and get my refund, but they don’t respond to my emails. I even scheduled a call since you can’t call them directly and they ignore it. At this point I’m convinced they fell off and started scamming people. Now it seems like my only option is to call my bank.<//review></record>

I paid $210 in full on November 23 for a gialla carbon grille and have not received ANY contact from outcast, zero shipping information, and was LIED to by the outcast support team. They told me the batch was just being finished and it would ship out December 21 and it never did and still says unfulfilled. Nor did they call me today for my SCHEDULED support call and provided no number to call in the google calendar invitation. After almost two months i still have nothing and no response from outcast. Do not buy anything from this website unless you want to wait almost two months for something to *ship* and not actually even ship.</text>

<Text>This place doesn't even have a phone number on its website. I wish I had realized that before I ordered from this place. The parts I ordered look great, but I can't even get an update on what the hell is going on with my orders. I'd give them zero stars if I could.

Never buying here again the customer service is atrocious, they never have the answers to your questions just links to their website. I ordered my part early October and I just barley got it and it was WRONG I paid extra 10$ for the led option what do I get ? The basic amber light with nothing else. They lost my package and never updated me. When I saw the box it was outsourced from rock auto and concept z performance! Next time I will just order from concept Z directly I understand covid had make things more difficult but even before the outbreak I was waiting several months. Never again<//review>< Resp>

3/11 edit: haven't heard from them again. They were quick to take my money but they didn't say the product was made to order on the website. Website said it was in stock. Back to 1 star.

I had ordered airlift management through Outcast beginning of April. I knew the shipment was going to be delayed due to the pandemic so I wasn’t expecting a quick turn around time. A few times I had gotten antsy & emailed Outcast & they had responded to my emails each time, apologizing, even though they didn’t have to because the shipping wasn’t being delayed on their part. They kept in contact with me & updated me as need be. I had just received my management yesterday & I am very happy, aside from missing my free stickers lol but that’s not their doing either. I will definitely be ordering from them again due to their amazing customer service!< /review>

Ordered a clear side marker for my car in January, on the website it said free shipping to the lower 48 states when I purchased it charged me 7 dollars, thinking it’d be expedited shipping or something I was okay with it. 3 months later I contact support and was informed that due to them shipping from Japan that wasn’t the case and that they’d ship my order Friday the 13th or Monday the 16th of this month. No offers to reimburse for the shipping no sorry it’s taking a long time just that they had stuff in stock now and will ship them. Well those days past and still no updates. Stay as far away from this place as you can.<//text>

<Text>One of the worst “business” I’ve ever come across. First off they don’t have a number you can reach for general questions like any other business. Even worse I was around the area and went to their actual location and they were closed! Even though it’s indicated they should be open. Talk about a waste of time and money, they can’t even operate the basics of having a “business” take your money elsewhere<//Text>< response>

Normally not one to write reviews but trying to help anyone that is trying to decide to purchase from outcast. I would recommend shopping elsewhere when looking for parts for your g, this company has failed to contact me back numerous times and have failed to also update my order with me after 2 weeks of the order being placed. Outcast also does not have a phone number anywhere listed on their website. I have even gone to their Instagram in hopes of getting contact with them there but with no luck. Before purchasing from here I hope you do your research because this company is no longer a decent company as it seems it was a couple years ago. Until this is resolved by giving me a refund for my order or get an update on it. This review will stay at a 1 Star. Also the order wasn’t something small like side markers it was a $600 kuruma z front bumper. Thank you for listening.</review>

Placed an order for a motordyne xyz pipe on December 1st and to this day I have not received any updates on my order, I tried to get in contact with them but they haven't answered any of my emails, I would like to get a refund at this point, but since they don't even have a phone number listed on their website and don't answer my emails it's impossible to ask for one.

<Review>DONT ORDER FROM HERE.Ordered clear LED corner lights for my car on mid October, it’s now mid December and no new updates and no product.Sales rep stated after December 2nd I’d start receiving updates because they “were waiting for items to ship bulk” two weeks later after that date and nothing at all. No response from customer service, absolutely ridiculous plus they’ve been deleting my reviews on their page LOL<//Review>< Response>

If you have a G35 like me & are looking to make it turn heads then this is the website you've been looking for. I've ordered 3 items from them & my overall experience has been some of the best I've dealt with. The quality of their items is well know as the best and I would agree. Sometimes the orders are sent to be made like my carbon trunk but oh man is it worth it! My G turns heads everywhere I go and people always ask where they can find these items. Definitely the best for authentic aftermarket parts. 10/10<//Review>

Excellent service!!! I would definitely recommend Outcast Garage to anyone interested in purchasing quality parts with excellent pricing and customer service for their Infiniti G35 Coupe! I have purchased multiple items from them over the years and all of the transactions were fast and reliable. Their customer service was great as well because they were very thorough and informative when it came to choosing the right application for my vehicle.</review>

The Outcast Garage bumper came ready to go on, I didn't have to fight with it at all to get it to fit.  The durability is far above that of the "Plastic Reinforced Fiberglass" that the competitors sell.  The prices are fair, the shipping is fast, and the customer service reps were extremely helpful prior to the sale.  I will do business with them again in the future, and I encourage anyone who inquires with them to do the same!<//text>< date>

Ordered an exhaust was told it was on back-order and will take 2 weeks to ship. Over a month passes without any status updates even after numerous attempts to contact Outcast. Upon requesting cancellation and a refund I am still waiting for it to complete and it has also been over a month. NON-EXISTENT customer service.</review>

I went in to Outcast Garage a couple of Saturdays ago to pick an air suspension. The guys there were super helpful and very attentive. They had what I needed in stock and even helped me put all the parts in my car. We proceeded to discuss other options for the kit that I was getting. And based off of what my desired build goals we decided to upgrade the management system. They did not have it in stock but offered to ship it direct from the manufacturer to my house at no additional cost. Great place for aftermarket parts and accessories. I will most certainly be returning for more parts.</Text>

<Text>I ordered a bunch of exterior parts from OutCastGarage and I was very satisfied. I needed help getting the correct parts, and the guys over at OutCastGarage we’re very helpful in helping me! All the parts showed up on time, and were high quality! I would highly recommend doing business with this company they are straight forward, and will assist you in any questions you have.<//Text><user_id>103783579748518104221<//user_id><gmap_id>0x80dcd8bde83f31d7:0x4d731ff01cc220fa<//gmap_id><date>1507828389458</date>< Name>

I ordered a rear diffuser for a G37 coupe. I paid an extra $100 for a carbon fiber finish and when it arrived the carbon fiber weave pattern was damaged in several places - over 10 that I've found to date - complete with large black dots (empty space with no CF) and cracks in some rounded areas, all underneath the pre-applied clear coat.

I contacted them and, at first, they seemed to be willing to help. They asked for pictures and I sent many.

Here's where it went wrong. So after I sent pictures they told me to call them back early (that's odd?) on the next Monday as the manufacturer isn't open until then. Being extremely busy with work, I missed the first Monday and figured I would call them again the next available morning.

Unfortunately their opening time is 11 am for me and I'm already busy at work and cannot take breaks especially considering I don't know how long they'll hold me. Weekends of course, they're unavailable to help me. I was unable to contact them for some time.

Fast forward a few months, with 3 emails and many unanswered calls to their customer service, and they've simply stopped responding to me. Every email I've sent after my first attempt to call has gone unanswered. I have since just given up on trying.

The best part is that they sent me an automated email asking me to review their product. I saw it recently while going through old emails and it reminded me to give a review.

Here you go.< /text>

AMAZING SERVICE. Ordered many expensive and large items from Outcast. Not only do they respond quickly, they ship quickly too! Definitely recommend.< /Review>

Told me they would ship out the replacement as soon as they received the product back. I sent it back to them, and received no updates on the new shipment. Open a support ticket with them, and they claim it was already sent. The person stated that the product was already sent, and as proof, he sends me the tracking number for the ORIGINAL shipment. I haven't received a product, and my credit card is still charged. I'll be making a complaint with my credit card company.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<text>Acutlly it was my dream to get the IPL Body kit , and i found very good deal , it was little expensive for me but to be honest it worth to get it , it feel too good when you get original stuff no need to paint and fix like other  dealer or other kind of kits , also what i like of them that they did for me price match for some items , and what made me love the company more than the i was short time on shipping i need my item on specific time , guys what happen , they get my full box with every thing before my date by one day , with normal cost of charge , i SAVED some money . look maybe i could not express my feeling in good way but I’m happy that i had to buy from them , when i install the kit i will provide the pic , thanx

<time>1465486169885< /time><review>Hi guys, I just wanted to review two of your products I have on my 2005 G35 sedan. (Very positive).
Your nismo style rear lip and nismo style side skirts were a dream to install. It took me 30 minutes or less to swap the side skirts over. They fit better than the OEM ones, using OEM hardware. They also provide more clearance for jacks and jack stands than the OEM ones did. Outstanding.
Installing your rear lip was also surprisingly easy. I used speed nut style hardware that bit into the OEM plastic bumper from underneath with 1/4-20 stainless hardware. No double sided tape needed. The result was a removable, steadily mounted lip with tight body lines thanks to your mold design.
You guys changed my mind about fiberglass products. Your parts do not feel brittle and ready to crack at any moment, they are flexible and sturdy.
I will be back to purchase some carbon fiber products in the near future.</review><Gmap_id>0x80dcd8bde83f31d7:0x4d731ff01cc220fa< /Gmap_id><user_name>Mike Osipowicz<//user_name>< Pics>

Very nice, clean and friendly yogurtland.  Plenty of tables and outdoor seating.  Next to the panda expenses around the corner in the parking lot from safeway.  There's a single stall bathroom for customers.  Yogurtland has an app which makes it very easy to accrue award points with their reward program< /Review>

<review>All flavors you like are here.  The owner watches like a hawk, but that's understandable when inconsiderate people come in and taste test every option.  That's not right or fair especially when they dont even buy anything.  Anyways, the yogurt is always good, right temp, plenty of add ons if you like. Location is very clean.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

The restaurant is kept clean. The service is great . There are always several flavors of yogurt. I like the area and the customers that come in there seem to be very respectful of the store and the Personnel also. Frozen yogurt is expensive.< /Review>

Restrooms were nice and clean midday on a Saturday. (Which was my primary focus at that moment..) The man working was very amicable. Inside was clean and filled with happy faces. Of course the frozen yogurt was great as is every Yogurtland I've been to and the dispensers were not empty or on low. I enjoyed it very much. It's by my work so I will be coming again!<//Text>

My to go yogurt place.

This place is very close to where I live. And whenever I have some of those days that I crave for yogurt, this is my to go place. They have quite a bit of flavors to choose from. One of my all time favorite is the twilight chocolate, its not too sweet and very chocolatey. They rotate different flavors once in a while, another favorite of mine is the mango. They have lots of toppings to add to your yogurt as well. The price is reasonable and worth it. Aside from this place is close to where I live, i like it that they close late. I believe they close at 10 and during weekends they close later.< /review>

<review>It is a little expensive for frozen yogurt but as a treat once in a while it doesn't really phase me. My favorite mango flavor is there year round and when you have a small infatuation with fro-yo as I do, well, you suddenly have a regular.

Personally, I absolutely love this place. It is always clean, the fresh fruit toppings are never past their prime, and the few people for staff are extremely nice. It has become a place I visit monthly, along with Panda right next to it ;)< /review></record></dataset><record>

We have been to all the frozen yogurt places in the trivalley and Yogurtland is still our favorite.  It is a good value and the flavors are always a good variety from classic tart to now creamy.  They themes for a couple of months at a time.  Parking is a bit challenging.  They also have a good rewards program.< /Review>

Moving from LA to Bay area was a big change and one of the is not seeing as many Yogurtland as much we used to see. It was such a relief to find this.. Though it's a little bit drive from my house I don't mind to get a taste of diff flavour.</review>

<Review>Be careful about the scale and cost. This place taped off the scale that measures weight of the yogurt and the receipt has only the total. We got 2 small cups half full and was charged for over a pound and a half of yogurt. How can that be?  Not coming here anymore.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>The Decor was Playful, but I didn't Appreciate the Waiter. He was lazy and just act like he didn't wanted to be here. This Place needs more Employees at the front counter. It is always a long line and than your Yogurt will most likely melt. Although I liked the the toppings and lots of Flavors to choose from. Great for Kids to come. I consider this Spot as a own choice.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808fec6cf4971867:0xbed3d3ac18ea38ca< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< review>
There's so many different frozen yogurt places around. But Yogurtland has always been my favorite. This location has always been one of my favorites too, their staffs are very friendly and very welcoming. I also love their marketing team and how they really think about changing their campaigns every month, that I save their custom spoons because it's so different and they always keep it interesting. (I love the despicable me campaign!)  That's why I always go out of my way just to get yogurtland! Their flavors are unique (I love the pistachio flavor!) I also love their sea salt flavor! I just really hope that they soon open a new location closer to San Francisco. It is just really hard to compare yogurtland!< /review>

Price is reasonable and I love being able to choose how much of what I want on my frozen yogurt. Good for group outings when you have cravings for something sweet< /Review>

Yogurt here is a lot cheaper than the mall! I used to eat at the mall until my friend took me to this place. Fell in love. The froyo is really good and the prices are cheap! I always come by when I pass this place and is craving froyo. Great for desert after eating at the many restaurants in this place or after grocery shopping.</text>

The best frozen yogurt I've had - better value than Pinkberry!! I just wished they stocked up on the cupcake batter flavor 😋 Always clean and the employees are welcoming and awesome! My husband calls this place "happiness and pure childish joy in a bowl." Lol</Text>

<review>I came here in the early morning for breakfast.

Took the special breakfast, which were 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, bacon and hashbrown. Even got some tacos on the side.

It was a truly delicious American breakfast which I did not really expect from a Mexican place.

Would come back here! Owner is also super friendly.< /review><GmapID>0x80c2c67d67746c41:0xd5ae1fb3682aa9dc< /GmapID><rate>5< /rate><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9-svUbYXCsJtYYhInbiQb3OSyPQlJURp7pifz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFgZoe35hW5DOj-RZ-iNSU89jaUgWidVPMEakS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8CEQrd95iFLlpGvbLwsfBjZ2Xomq6u6wH6_jt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoTjaUOonhivxxI064A2-9XXR3LZibtnH6c-g5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWtnxXV9lKEgu8PHYXWl_nzR-oIllzaTwqagbs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEsFjaep6De7Y1HjPJ0h2kPykNheAPPPa8PrRA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgiBGlwmFwdu6ZqQ5iaCmlXcqFlaci4yIrhfvH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><date>1578172709872<//date>< Name>

Since I saw good reviews I thought the place would be ligit... Do not eat here. It tastes like the majority of the food comes from a can. It was such a disturbing experience.  Nothing like Mexican food. My son Romeo was like what would Chef say about this place...</Review>

So far I have had the fish taco and I love it. The Pico de gallo is so fresh and tasty. The pupusas are excellent. I could drink the salsa that is served with chips. The chilaquilas (red) were great. Also the caldo de res. I loved the fresh made blood orange juice. The service is also excellent. Tell Javier I sent you!< /text>

<Text>You gotta try the mole for sure, and they also have one vegan option. The vegan burrito, good size and you can order a side of fries with it. Cafe de olla is banging! Very cute little hidden spot. They also have pupusas & platano frito for our Salvi friends.< /Text>< Pictures>

I would recommend anyone who wants a new dodge or used car to see Alex Rodriguez this guy was amazing. He helped me get my wife car with no pressure made me feel comfortable he offered water and snacks while we waited. I’ve been through multiple cars sales man and this guy is the best. I would go back and see him again for another car. Very respectful and honest.< /Review>

<text>I give this service dept one star due to no lower rating. When you give an appointment time and date you expect just that not to find out this is only a time to take your vehicle to the back and park it until they get caught up!!
2 to 3 days later they got to my vehicle the service manager was not professional when I questioned him about my vehicle was just a little rude. I even turned down doing anymore business with  Haddad due to this issue this has been with the last 2 vehicles I have purchased from them<//text><gmap_id>0x80ea6aa30a6c6ee1:0x50dc6ae58936d8ea<//gmap_id>< user_id>

<review>Went looking to buy a van, dealer was asking nearly the same price for a used 2019 Dodge Grand Caravan with 32,000 miles on it as they were for a brand new 2020 model. Ended up finding a 2019 with 15,500 miles for about $15,000 LESS (yes, that's fifteen thousand less!) at Barber Honda...

...oh yeah, the van I bought still had the remainder of it's manufacturer warranty AND Barber Honda GAVE me a 20-year 250,000 mile powertrain warranty also!

Thank you Haddad Dodge for making me run in the other direction!👍👍👍👍< /review>< pictures>

We had excellent service with Haddad Dodge Bakerfields CA. From Mr Haddad himself to sales person Nick who most of answered a 100 text messages from me ! We live in Anaheim, Ca someone ( name skips me right now ) hand delivered the paperwork for us to sign and to the great couple Barry & Sabrina who delivered our Dodge Ram truck to us....Everyone was very polite and knew what they were doing at all times! It was nice seeing Barry unload the truck and Sabrina take every precaution to ensure the truck got off loaded without a glitch ! If we need another vehicle we will be back ! Thanks to everyone involved with this sale, Billie< /Review>

Had my 2016 Ram 1500 towed in due to a no start issue. They got it in and diagnosed and repaired in a reasonable time frame. My truck had some ground cables loose. The staff is friendly and very motivated to get the job done. I’m definitely coming back and thank you James for my truck repair updates.<//review>

They got my car in very quickly and had it ready to go by the next morning. David was great to work with and knew what he was talking about. Even when a small problem arose a few days later with something else, he had me come in right away and they took care of it quickly.</text>

Unprofessional  very poor costumer service skills. Never have I felt so unappreciated or treated unfairly with a company I’ve spent thousands at. Some of the staff definitely needs to be coached and
trained on dealing with their customers. If a customer is paying for a  service it is not a favor you’re doing for them to make sure it’s completed properly Paul!!< /review>

<text>Hi my name is Arthur Cisneros, James Juarez took over our car after being there a couple weeks being in the service department.   He did a fantastic job handling everything we had no problems with our truck being in his care. He communicated with us on every step being very compassionate even with our situation being  a little different. He didn’t let that get in the way of getting our truck fixed.  Thank you James Juarez we would definitely recommend you anytime. Sorry for the confusion on the first review it was not towards you at all. Thank you for all your help. You were awesome.</text>< pictures>

<review>So my truck was in the shop at Haddad for almost four weeks. At the beginning there was no communication from our service advisor. Then  James Juarez took over. He was amazing. He communicated every step of the way, he was very compassionate about doing his job and made us feel very welcome. Our situation was a little different then others but he got the job done. Thank you James for everything you did to get our truck back to us and thank you for your awesome customer service.</review>< userid>

<Text>Got my son a car Sunday great service by Eduardo the starz aren't based on him but on who ever decides on placing the front license plate bracket. So I got home most front brackets go held on the bottom grill looks like this stock one they have to drill holes on the front bumper was not asked if I wanted it on they took it upon themselves now I have a new 2021 car with holes on the front bumper.I removed it cause that's how I like my vehicle's. Next time ask it's the buyer's choice big he wants it on or not I think.<//Text><Time>1609855974882<//Time><rate>3<//rate></record>

<text>so I bought a Rebel on a Sunday, had it for a few days. Did not like the V6, I had a bit of a buyer remorse and wanted a V8 instead. knowing that i waved the cooling-off period, plus it was more than 3 days that I had the truck. All I did was text the best guy Papa-John Shaktah with my remorse and how much i wanted a V8, he called me without any hesitation said with his voice come tomorrow at 8:30 will get you a better truck. 10:00 am i was on my way out with a newer truck lower miles and good deal. IF you want a Dodge new or used. Go see PAPA-JOHN SHAKTAH THE GUY THANK YOU< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>Unprofessional service:
I negotiated and purchased a truck with a trade-in. The deal included
the install of a bed liner and swapping the new truck's tires with my
trade. I was told the service department was closed, and it would have
to be done on Monday (two days later). Monday came and my salesman
Victor insisted that I previously agreed to pay for the tire swap,
which was false. I explained the included tire swap was included in
the contract at no additional cost. He then transferred me
to the sales manager Eddie (that I personally negotiated these
terms with less than 48 hours earlier). Eddie also tried insisting
that I would pay for it, and had the nerve to say twice: "I know you're not
hard of hearing". After regaining my composure and resisting the urge
to return with the truck immediately, I
referenced to Eddie the contract. Apparently that jogged
his memory, and he transferred me to Parts to get the bed liner and
tires arranged.

In summary, they were friendly when making the deal, and then were unprofessional immediately afterward. I won't do business with this company again, and will share this ridiculous
experience to my coworkers and friends!</Text><Rate>1</Rate>< Time>

Horrible communication. When the service advisors say they'll call you to let you know what's going on and what needs to be done to your vehicle, don't expect a call. They NEVER call you. Also, don't bother leaving a message, because they NEVER call you back. They NEVER let you know the status og your vehicle. You're left wondering for 2 weeks what the hell is happening to your car and if you're going to have to pay anything. I didn't mind the wait, but I definitely want to know what is going on with my car. The only reason I took it to them was for a warranty issue. Suffice to say I will never go back for anything else. I will gladly pay extra for good customer service.<//Review>

<date>1603298220068<//date><Rate>1</Rate><Text>It took 3 tries to get my recalls fixed on my Ram 2500. The first time, in the spring, I was told they wouldn’t have parts for one, but they could take care of reprogramming the emissions so they made me an appointment. After driving two vehicles there, I was told both recalls HAD to be completed at the same time and the person I spoke with didn’t know why they scheduled me since both couldn’t be done. Thanks for wasting my time and fuel! The second time, after receiving postcards from Chrysler on the recalls, I called the toll free number and scheduled an appointment for September (they assured me the parts would be there). When I arrived for my appointment, no one at the dealership knew I was coming and they didn’t have the parts. Thanks for wasting my time and fuel again!!! I was told the parts would take about 2 weeks so a third appointment was made for October and parts were ordered. I was told to call a day or two before my appointment, and when I did, I was told that the parts were ordered but Chrysler cancelled the order the next day! I have yet to be told why, even though the person I spoke with said she would look into it and get back to me!  New parts were ordered and my truck was finally taken care of, but not before having to drive clear across town 3 times and waste a bunch of time and fuel. At the local GM dealership, someone always greeted me before I ever got out of my vehicle and it always came back washed (same for the Subaru dealer).  But here I have to stand and wait inside for a service person and my truck was filthy when I finally got it back. The people I dealt with were all friendly, but my experiences have not made me want to go back. This is my first ever Chrysler vehicle, and I love the truck, but if this is what I can expect for service, it will be my last!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Text>Alex was a fantastic service advisor. He made the whole process of getting some warranty work done as easy as possible. It took a while to get an appointment with things being backed up, but the turn around was quick. Waiting for an available appointment was much better than letting my car sit there for 2 weeks like some places do. After prior less-than-pleasant experiences and reading lots of negative reviews, I can see that this service department is really turning things around. I highly recommend them, especially Alex, even to those who have had a bad experience in the past.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Our salesman promised to save a car for us due to the fact that he was off for the weekend.  We trusted him & waited so he would get the sale. They sold the car over weekend.  I will never trust them again. We tried to to do the right & lost out on the vehicle we had our hearts set on.</text>

My ram 3500 was giving me problems as I was making a trip from Louisiana to Bakersfield. Gave it to David Hernandez on Monday morning. He called me later that afternoon with with a diagnosis of my truck. He said he could have it fixed by Thursday or Friday at the latest. He called me again Wednesday to tell me I could come get my truck. It was fix and ready to go to work. It was major work and Haddad Ram came through with flying colors. Thank you David for doing what you do best. I strongly recommend this dealership.</Text>

<Review>Still working with them. Talked to Francisco the salesman and he was great to work with. Didn't have quite what I was looking for in stock and he's working to possibly get me a truck that fits my needs. Francisco made me feel welcomed and comfortable during the whole experience.  Looking forward to completing my purchase through haddad because of the experience and knowledge of Francisco.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80ea6aa30a6c6ee1:0x50dc6ae58936d8ea< /Gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures>< Time>

I once thought the sales people here were the worst part of the dealership. Now I find myself driving to Porterville for service.  When I bought my Ram they kept me for hours before raising the price when the out of town dealer that they were price matching closed on the last day of the sale.   That cost me $2k.  Now they won't make service appointments to work on your car.   The only appointments are to speak to a service advisor to drop your car.   They will diagnose it 1-5 days later.   Last time for mine it was 6 days at the sister dealership before it was looked at..  Thats a couple hundred in rental car while they have it parked in the back for no reason. I can talk to a service advisor on the phone.  Porterville will give you an appointment to have your car looked at.< /review>

Car is never ready on time. Dropped off my hellcat on Tuesday for a factory recall and it wasn’t ready even until Friday. And this isn’t the first time it has happened. This is probably the 4th time. Leaving your car here means you won’t get it back for 4-5 days or even 2 weeks sometimes. You get it back all dirty. Never coming back here again< /review>

I went in for an oil change but there were a million other people there for the same thing so it took a long time but I always feel like my car runs a little bit better after they finish working on it. I went on a test drive while I waited. The sales people were very nice, too. Not super pushy. I’d recommend them.</Review>

Dave is the worst service manager, called to explain why I was upset, took my car to get some work done after having issues just to have it collect dust prior to having an appointment to get it looked at, but was given a called my the advisor I was dealing with “ Cotton” telling me that my vehicle wasn’t assigned to a technician today cause there wasn’t any available today, and that tomorrow it will be assigned to a technician, now this was told to me at 3pm being that the day was pretty my over already. Called back to speak with the service manager Dave and things didn’t get resolved either, instead of listening to what I had to say, he cuts me off from speaking while explaining the situation and wants to end the phone call right away, I said it loudly enough for him to hear to stop cutting my of while I speak and listen to what I have to say, I understand they get busy and things happen, but how are you going to call the customer with an update saying no techs available until tomorrow, when I was told a different thing when I dropped off the car being told that we will work on the vehicle today and it might stay till tomorrow that’s not problem. The issue here is that “cotton” the advisor that is handling my vehicle could have simply made up a statement saying you know what sir your vehicle won’t get looked at today due to being short staffed and following all COVID 19 procedures, and with that everything would have went way better and calm, things happen and I understand that but if better customer communication skills would have been used none of this or this review would be happening. Speaking with Dave the service manager was very unprofessional, did not let me speak, was constantly trying to cut me off from talking, and had very poor attitude towards me and the situation. He did let me know that they had 300 cars they are back up on and vehicle’s that have been sitting there for 3 weeks and they are doing the best they can to get it all done the fast they can and that my car will get worked on doesn’t help at all when communication skills are poor and  play the “she said this he said that” game with with you and the advisor said. With all that being said this hasn’t been the first time I’ve had bad experience with dodge at their service department</Review>

< review>
We were traveling with our 5th wheel from Phoenix to Oregon and had a bad connection from our truck to our trailer. The employee at the Napa store recommended Haddad Dodge.It was 30 minutes before closing and your serviceman Jose was very courteous and knowledgeable and had us taken care of quickly. We are so extremely grateful for his help.</review>

<text>There's a couple of people in the service department that have very poor costumer service skills. Never have time to answer questions.   Never answer their phones even while having your vehicle for 2 weeks. Then you get your vehicle back and it's having the same issues. Very unprofessional and unpleasant experience . Not to mention you call and they say you have an appointment at 8:30 to bring your car in and you sit there and wait 30 minutes in their line until they get to you. What's the point of saying you have an appointment? Will not go back here. Will find somewhere else that will do warranty work.</text>< pics>

<review>Well 2 hours $80 later they got my oil changed I had ask them too wash my vehicle it sat back there 30 minutes I finally told them just bring it up they said another hour to wash it.
So if you have nothing better to do than sit down at dodge service for 2 hours and give them $80 to just change your oil go for it. The quick lube places does a cheaper faster and checks more than Dodge does< /review>< pics>

Big shout out to Ray from sales dept.that assisted us  with getting the car we wanted. Got there in the morning. Showed Ray a picture online of a particular car advertised and he immediately got it for us to check out! Ray worked with us and the closer to get us within the range we wanted to spend. I appreciate that he didn't try to sell us a more expensive car or every other car on the lot. I appreciate it when sales people do not act like sharks.Thamk you Ray for your professionalism and good humor. Thank you also gor making sure it was nice and clean before you delivered it to our home. This is the second car sincec 2009 we have bought from Haddad.<//Review>

<Time>1596298778450</Time><rating>3<//rating><text>Buying was good with no issues, I read a majority of the reviews before purchasing my vehicle, unfortunately most of the issues are with the service department thats why I knocked off 2 stars, I bought my vehicle late in the evening, my salesman had instructed me to bring in my vehicle to get it detailed and all the stickers taken off the following day, so going forward I brought my vehicle in on the next day, and thats when I found out that the big portion of the poor reviews were spot on with the service department, I spent nearly 3 hours waiting for them to wash my new vehicle, I spoke to my salesman about the wait time, he went out of his way to go back there and help wash and detail the vehicle which in turn took possible sale opportunities away from him, I will probably take my vehicle to another dealership in the future to keep my vehicle under warranty and for all of my oil changes, this review shouldn't scare you away from buying a vehicle from Haddad, but you may want to think twice about the service department, dont just read my review, read all the rest of the reviews and you make the call.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<rating>1</rating><review>I recently purchased a vehicle from the dealership on Harris Rd and I was told by the sale person "Vick" as an incentive to purchase the vehicle they would give me a free  maintenance package that would cover the maintenance for the term of the loan as well as covering the expense for gap insurance for the vehicle. After I had purchased the vehicle I noticed that I had been charger for both items. I would like to be reimbursed for the additional chargers.

I wouldn't recommend this dealership to anyone...

Showed up on memorial day just to look they had free hot dogs, hamburgers, chips, soda, water plus giving away free Haddad Dodge stuff pretty cool. Will be back next weekend to possibly talk about a truck we liked today. Salesman was pretty awesome guy. He wasn't pushy either, very out going & down to earth. Looking forward to working with him if my husband decides that's the truck he wants.</text>

It was a typical oil change experience with one exception; it was a lot longer than usual  (about 4 hours). However, considering all of the activities taking place on the site (visiting choir, Santa and Mrs. Claus, and KUZZ radio broadcasting on location to name just a few) it wasn’t to big an issue to wait a little longer than normal.</Text>

<Text>I made a appointment for an oil leak.  When I took the truck in for the appointment they let me know that it may be a few days before they could look at it.  They did not have a rental vehicle available so I had to pay for a rental out of my pocket.  They had me pick up the vehicle 2 days later stating that they would have me bring it back when they were less busy.  Made me another appointment for 2 weeks out and advised  me not to park in the driveway since it is still leaking oil.  They said they would try to have a rental vehicle at that time.  I have never had good service with the Bakersfield RAM<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Review>My wife and I drove down from Visalia to have some "Recall" work done on our vehicle.  We had some issues with our local dealership that caused us to look elsewhere to have work done.  The work was completed in roughly two hours.  Our usual place would have taken all day.  It was worth the drive.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Went  in to see a Ram Rebel, decide to make the  purchase. Paul in the finance department shook my hand and agreed to a deal with the payment I was comfortable with. Told them to have the paper work ready and I would be back after work. Showed up, no paper work ready. Salesman comes and tells me that the prices was not correct and it would be more expensive then what was agreed(wasted my time). Oh well, I took my business to Bravo Chrysler and Jeep to find a better deal on a new Ram, accepted my offer over the phone. They paid off my Wrangler that Haddad threatened no one will pay it off. They didn't back down when I showed up.<//Review>

<Date>1578973529257< /Date><Rating>1</Rating><review>I took my 2018 ram 1500 limited to Haddad service center for a recall, faulty dome light , check engine light and oil change. Left the truck for 48 hours and service advisor David called me to pickup the truck all tasks were completed except dome light was on back order to arrive next Tuesday. Got home and checked under the truck to discover the drain plug on the oil pan had not been touched and oil filter not replaced. I took pics and contacted Haddad service center for a refund. Spoke with service manager Monty. Very upsetting, considering how expensive trucks are to drive and maintain.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Horrible customer service. Will not take my vehicle there again. Spend less on your commercials and more on your clients interactions. It will get you farther. Watching that on TV reminded me to come back and edit my post to remind you how horrible you service was. I hope you close soon and someone who repects the brand takes your place. If anyone needs details why I feel so strongly against them free to contact me. They know why.</Review>

<review>Took my truck in for a recall issue. Waited for just over an hour and was given my keys and told it was good to go.
Turns out the issue was never fixed at all. Was told they are sorry for how long things are taking. Time is not my issue, my issue is how about quality control? How about making dang sure everything is safe and taken care of before giving the customer their keys back. How about making sure everything that corresponds with the issue is addressed... And how did this get passed everyone???
I didn't leave the lot and they took the truck back in and fixed it the right way. Hopefully next time someone goes in they can fix their issue right the first time.< /review>< UserId.>

<text>Horrible service. Our Dodge Grand Caravan's engine started misfiring and the whole car was shaking. The problem was intermittent. We took it to Haddad Dodge, paid $155 for checkup (which took them almost a week). They said they can't find the problem, but their technician wants to take the engine apart and we need to pay $900 for him to take a look at the engine. Not to repair it, just him to do his job and find the problem.
We took it to another place that found out that there has been a recall for our vehicle for this exact problem and he printed out a service bulletin.
We came back to Haddad and they point blank refused to admit that there's a recall. The manager said we have to pay another $155 for them to check it out again and decide if it's eligible for a repair.

They have unprofessional, untrained staff and money-grabbing ways. And guess what? I received a call from them asking if I would like to purchase another vehicle from them!

Needless to say, we will never buy another Dodge again.< /text>< pics>

Brought my car in for a oil change and check engine light. Dropped off at 7am,told ready by end of day. Called at end of day and told still diagnosing the check engine light,would keep until next day. After my calls the next day,told thermostat needed replacement,parts available,finished by end of day. End of day told needed to keep overnight,ready by next morning. Finished later that afternoon. Over $700 dollars. I asked and was told check engine light specified thermostat,I asked why a day to diagnose then?  Took it home. Next morning,big puddle off red fluid under left front headlight,assumed a transmission line. Took it in,sat for awhile,told it was a coolent leak. They pressure checked the violent system and discovered a fault radiator cap. I assumed this was done any time violent system opened up. Manager Dave replaced the cap for free and we left.. You decide if you would return or not.<//Review>

Worse experience in my life. I will never recommend this dealer to my friends and family. From the managers up to the finance people. This people don’t give a f&@$ about you. They’ll sell you the car and leave you dead on the road. Hyundai treated me a lot better than Haddad. They never call you back and they lie to you over and over. Never again ..I wouldn’t even give this dealer half of a star.</Text>

Actually I have done business with Haddad Kia by purchasing two new vehicles. My recent purchase, The Kia Sorento LX is a great vehicle with a superior warranty and 7 passenger capacity.  My wife and I are excited about our new SUV. We got a great price and the Kia Sorento is a nice looking SUV. They powder coated my rims black to match the color of the car and Kia picked up the bill and gave me a 3 day loaner to get the job done. I'm sure Haddad Dodge deals well too.< /Text>

Everyone we spoke with was polite and professional.  Special recognition to josh the salesman who patiently explained the different Durango trim levels to me and the technology features.  He continued to send me quotes and photos of avail inventory of black GT trim that I wanted.  He was off shift the day I returned about a week later to purchase so I asked the manager Fidel to make sure he gets credit for the sale.  Fidel turned the computer monitor around so I could see that jish’s Name was in my customer profile.  Great customer service !</Text>

Was traveling from Sacramento to Yuma Arizona and my 2017 RAM 2500 Laramie Limited started to develop a vibration that seemed to be coming from the rear end area.  I thought I was losing a u-joint in the rear driveline. I didn't want to be broke down somewhere along the highway in the middle of nowhere.
I pulled off of the freeway and stopped at Haddad Dodge without an appointment.
Explained my issue to one of the service writers and they immediately got a technician to do a test drive with me.
Due to the road surface on the freeway close to the dealership we couldn't exactly duplicate the issue. But he did feel the vibration.
We agreed that it could be a tire problem, driveline, or possibly something altogether different.
We agreed to start with doing a 4 tire balance and multipoint inspection.
They got me squeezed in between their other scheduled appointments and had me back on the road in a little over 4 hours.
It didn't fix my problem with the truck but I was at least reassured it wasn't the driveline.
Made it to Yuma without any problems.
Going to a tire shop tomorrow to have the tires throughly checked.
I would recommend Haddad Dodge and was very pleased with the service I received.<//Text>

Terrible customer service in the Dodge service department.
No one returns calls
They sat on my 2014 Dodge Grand caravan for 6 days last year before working on the transmission.
They worked on it for 2 hrs less than a year ago and are saying they rebuilt the transmission.
No way could they rebuild it in 2 hrs
And if they did it's already giving me more problems again less than a year later.
And now it's been 3 days after I waited 2 days to take it there because they were so behind in the transmission shop and no one is calling me back.
Worst service ever<//review>

I would never use the dealership ever again! I took my truck in for a check engine light. Told me it was trubo code. They performed another service which cost me 1300 out of my pocket. Turned out it was a bad trubo after charging me 1300. They did not want to refund me my money back only credit me for the service.I will never use them after my credit has reached.<//Review>

David Hernandez was rude and did not provide good customer service and was actually confrontational beware and don’t go here avoid this place like covid-19<//Review>< GmapID>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Lazy people! Destroyed my radio during an update and sent me off with a sorry about your luck attitude. Told me it wouldnt be covered by my warranty and I'll need to purchase another to get it fixxed. They lied I called uconnect and it was definitely 100% covered. They never even checked. Several service advisors are great
The management is terrible and cant even give a call back when promised. In order to get in contact you have to go down there and demand a meet.

Never gave any loaner vehicle or was ever asked the option

Chrysler replaced it as I had to do all of the communication because the advisor was too lazy to do their job.

Chrysler paid for it.. haddad did not

I will never go back.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>I bought my 2018 Dodge Ram new at Cabral Dodge but it is not close to my home so I decided to use Haddad Dodge for service because it is closer. I ended up having a check engine light that kept coming on, 3 times each time I would talk to Jeff Chistiansen  and he went out of his way to get me a loaner car. I am so appreciative for his kindness . I live an hour away from Haddad dodge and my wife works   soI was in a bit of a pickle. Andrea was my service advisor and was very helpful in taking care of me and my truck. She contacted Chrysler corporate for what direction to proceed to and would let me know every day
What was taking place after over a week of struggling with the repairs I finally got my Ram back and it’s running fine with no problem<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><username>Jim Owen<//username></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>I am a co signer on a vehicle traded in for a Ram truck. The transaction was on August 10. As of today, September 5th, the trade in has not been paid off. I have been getting the run around by finance and the DMV clerk. Hopefully, I will not get a 30 late on my credit. I would never had known about the pay off without checking the account. Go purchase from another dealership who is organized, otherwise you could get a 30 day late on your credit. Plus, California states your trade in is to be paid 21 days of the sale. They are not in compliance with California law. Go somewhere else, or you will be contacting a lawyer like myself.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Sales associate, Steven Lewis, greeted my husband and I immediately and was friendly and helpful from the gate. Steven went above and beyond to accommodate us in purchasing a new truck. Haddad Dodge welcomed our family and was very friendly to our children. The finance manager Paul was patient and waited for us to get some food for our children as we had been there a while making our decision. The experience around the board was top notch and I would definitely recommend Haddad Dodge and Steven Lewis to anyone looking for a great truck and excellent service!!<//Review>< pics>

One of the worst possible experiences is dealing with Haddad. The sales team of dodge is mediocre, we dealt with a kia staff member who made us feel so much more comfortable but the management of this dealer was careless, rude, and I would suggest anyone to visit another dealer.<//Review>

<text>I have never received such poor customer service before in my life  especially in the automotive industry.  I have been to run down mechanic shops with dirt and junked cars all around it and have received better customer service from these ghetto shops than this "professional" dealer.

I made an appointment a week ahead of time to bring my car in at 7 AM because of no A/C.  I brought my car in and I'm the first one in.  Car gets taken to the back.  30 MINUTES LATER and the advisor comes out and tells me the car will be in all day.  I had no words so I just went home.  So I left home and received no update.  I called and called and called only to be constantly be told they have no answer for me.  WHAT?!?  My car was the first one in!  How can they have no answer for me.  At 5:30 they told me it will be done tomorrow.  Sure enough tomorrow comes around and still nothing.  I call and call and call and get the run around.  Finally after bothering so much I get a message on my voice mail telling me that have done NO DIAGNOSTIC AT ALL!!  It turns out my car was sitting there FOR TWO DAYS!!  I immediately ask permission to leave work and I immediately tell them to just give me back the car.  It still took them 30 minutes just to get someone just to get it out from their parking lot from behind!  UNBELIEVABLE!!

I am never going back to this dealer again.  The worst part is that they other Dodge/Chrysler dealer on the other side of town is no better.  NEVER COME HERE!!< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

I don’t recommend this Dealer Haddad Dodge in Bakersfield. Since I bought my 2017 Dodge 3500 I had problems with it , No good to get a work truck there piece of S&@$ I took it in there with different problems to service department for AC repair they did nothing and said the truck was fine. Then I purchased a extended warranty there because mine was gonna expire and my truck broke down of the engine. I took it to another Mopar dealer for repair and they told me the extended warranty was not good what the F&@$ you it doesn’t work.

Mr. David Rodriguez made me feel comfortable and didn't rushed me at all while making a decision on which car to buy. He also made sure I was aware of all features of each car I was looking at.  At the end of the day, I made a decision to buy a new 2018 Kia Optima.   I highly recommend to go to him if you’re  thinking about buying a car.< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>I came on Tuesday for service. They had to order a part. Next day i received a message stating To come in the next day to fix. I can on at my 8 am appointment and the lady said "oh I told you I was ordering a part". I told her I received  a text stating to come in.  She acted as if this is normal and I should have known that this was just an automated message and I didn't need to come in. She stated not all the parts are in.  I told her in just leaving my vehicle so the van just finish everything and call me when done.  I'm waiting now for there shuttle to take me home and is been almost 2 hours.  What a waste of my day off. I've had issues with dodge from a different area as well not wanting to cover under warranty on things.  This will be my last dodge I buy.

So after I left the review I get the response below from the owner so I called the number provided and left a message to discuss.  They  never returned the call.  This is Dodge for you.<//Review>< Pictures>

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and the service I received from Lupe Pelayo. She was very friendly and knowledgeable about the product. She took the time to explain the benefits and features to me. All the while no pressure. If you want to experience what a auto or truck buying experience should be. I highly recommend Lupe. You will not be sorry. Thanks Lupe!!!!!< /Review><time>1512071730540< /time></record>

Very poor communication, they always have attitude manager is a joke does not let you talk what so ever always trying to cut you off as you are talking and instead for find a a solution then make it worse and nothing gets done, cotton the advisor doesn’t give and explanation of what’s being don to your vehicle, and waits till the end of the day to let you know what’s going on with your car< /text>

Unqualified technicians, horrible customer service

We took our van to them in December with multiple issues... radio/Bluetooth not working right, automatical doors losing all power intermittently and needing the DVD screen replaced, multiple interior lights/problems. After 2+ weeks, they finally said they didn't know when a DVD player would arrive and gave me back my van stating they "couldn't duplicate" anything. They blamed the service writer for bad writing/explanation of the problems. Though I did give them a hand-written list of the problems and obviously, they could've contacted me for further information.

Since they'd already ordered the DVD and FINALLY got it in...over a month later, I gave them the benefit of the doubt  and took it back in in March to get the DVD player replaced,  other previous issues, plus transmission issue looked at. They stated they rebuilt the transmission and swapped the DVD player. Their technician drove the vehicle over 300 miles (had 7/8 tank of gas when dropped off...light came on as soon as I left the dealership when I picked it up) "to get the radio to mess up". They supposedly did an update and once again "couldn't duplicate issues" with other concerns. But stated, "if it keeps happening, they'll have an engineer come look at it". WHY wouldn't they have contacted the engineer the second time it was there? The visit was planned well in advance because we live an hour away and have to take 2 vehicles to drop it off, work around work schedules, etc.

After we got it back the second time, we contacted the dealership because the rotors suddenly shook violently, which did not happen at all before taking it to them. Also, after the transmission work, my vehicle lost it's power to "take off" and is lagging and the fuel mileage has decreased. Also since they worked on it, my cruise control hasn't worked well, not keeping speed...either dropping over 5mph before engaging or not attempting to engine break at all.

We contacted the dealership multiple times, finally was passed through to Jeff, the customer service manager and told him the problems...he assured us he'd call back soon...3 weeks later we contacted him again and he always acted like he was unfamiliar with the vehicle/us. It makes me believe they have constant problems that a customer with two visits and a list of things not fixed doesn't ring a bell.

They finally stated to bring it in and get a loaner vehicle while they checked it out. When I got to the dealership I requested to speak with the service manager.

I explained my disgust that none of the issues were fixed and it came back with more than before it was taken to them. I asked him why it would take 3 times to bring in a vehicle before contacting the engineer and he said it could be MONTHS before a DODGE certified engineer could come...once again...why not have scheduled it before?

I also explained told him that the cruise control wasn't working. He stated that the cruise control "is only to be used on flat land and doesn't engine break". FALSE.  Funny...it did before they worked on it.

I also brought up the fact that they ran my vehicle out of gas and how it puts unnecessary wear on the fuel pump and can put sediment from the tank into the filter.  FALSE.  He denied this as a possibility and stated  they're "not a gas station". While I wouldn't expect them to replace a little gas burned, I would expect them to put $5-10 of gas in a vehicle instead of leaving it on empty!

The service manager informed me "if the check engine light doesn't come on, then nothing is wrong with the vehicle". FALSE.

The service manager refused to tell me his qualifications when I asked considering his comments about the fuel pump/filter damage and cruise control.

High prices, very little negotiating, tons of back and forth, limited inventory, but you will walk out with a limp but you will get you new ride. Service dept absolutely awefull. Call 2 times to set an appointment emailed to set up 6 times.. NO oil change,!!! I will never go the there service dept! EVER!!!! Good side the sales man are all very nice, including the finance people. Super nice and not to pushy, from my experience. I have a 2015 Ram 1500 and 2018 Charger. 0 service done with them.</Review>

As a first time buyer things can get stressful and many sellsman try to get over on younger people but luckily I had Pedro along with the manager to talk me through all of my options and give me the best deals possible! Now I have my own transportation and a great guy to reference to anyone!

Have been looking at the Challenger online but needed to just sit in one to get the feel. Instead, Sales Rep. 'Victor' hands me the keys and so off I go to tour Bakersfield. Got back after a few. There was no real pressure, from both him or his boss. They tried, and did offer a really good deal, but we explained we need to buy when we are ready and they understood (sort of-after they are in it to sell cars...). I was very happy with the conversation and have no doubt we will buy from them and Victor. We very much enjoyed our visit to Haddad Dodge and felt we were treated very well.</Text>

<Review>First time buying a car and it was a pleasure dealing with Ismael. His knowledge, expertise, honesty and professional attitude can’t be found elsewhere... The whole experience from start to delivery was smooth. I will be buying from him again soon! Thank you again for the great service before, during and after the sale Ismael.<//Review><Name>Andrew</Name>< Resp>

<review>I went to their service department for help with my 2000 Dodge Ram 2500. The lady service writer read my check engine light as a bad crankshaft position sensor.

She then told me that they don't work on old trucks and they can't get the parts for them. The part is readily available at most auto parts stores.

She basically told me to take my old truck elsewhere. My truck has 220000 miles on it and I will be using it long after this woman loses her job.</review>< pics>

<date>1541512682750< /date><Rating>1< /Rating><text>Horrible.  The service department is a total joke.  The service manager actually said to me,  " There's nothing wrong with the engine of a vehicle if the check engine light isn't on."  I needed some warranty work done and they couldn't figure it out. My husband diagnosed it and told them how to repair it and it still took them 3 weeks to figure it out.  But then they STILL DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM!!! When my car was finally returned, not having been repaired,  there was a muddy, oily substance all over the floorboards. I have since learned that Chrysler services/ repairs Dodge vehicles also.  Go there.< /text>< pics>

I had a very pleasant experience speaking to Alex today regarding purchasing a new vehicle. This kind of service is unheard of in the auto community because people do not have the patience to listen to your wants and concerns without being pushy or following their own motives. Can't wait to come in to get some new wheels!<//Text>

Matthew Willard is hands down the greatest salesperson i’ve ever had the pleasure of working with. I was referred to him by a friend of mine. He is a laid back, no pressure type of salesman which I can appreciate. He let me pick the car I wanted and didn’t try to sell me something i didn’t want which has happened in the past. He was happy to test drive as many cars as I wanted and gave me the best deal he could. After the sale, i received a hand written card from Matthew thanking me for my business. 1 month after having my car, Matthew called me to make sure everything was okay with me and my car. Superb service from an amazing person! Thanks Dodge! I will be coming to this dealership from now on.< /review>

They are good salesman and they will really work hard to try to make a sale of a car. I don't think they're quite Fair on the trade in value of the vehicle so. I know that's really where they make their profit is on used cars. But I love love love Challenger Shaker!< /review>

28,000 miles on my diesel RAM and one of the batteries dies. It took 2 days to test the battery to confirm that it was dead. They didn’t want to give me a loaner car initially but later agreed. They told be the drivers side battery was dead when mine and O’Riellys test show the passenger battery?!?! They replaced the battery but I’m sure the other will die soon because it was pulling the weight of the other. I guess I’ll take it back when the next one dies!<//text>

Rickey Nicholson did an exceptional job. He is a great salesman and goes above and beyond to take care of his customers. Definitely will be buying more vehicles from him.< /Review>

<review>I will continue going to this dealership time after time after time if need be. These people make you feel like family. From entering the lot, to finding exactly what you’re looking for, to being there for you even after you buy the car. Pedro in particular is an amazing employee. I bought my very first car with him and 9 months later it ended up totaled after an accident that I wasn’t even in. He was the first I contacted about my situation (after law enforcement and insurance). With no intentions of even buying a car, I went up to the lot and looked around with Pedro and further explained what happened. He worked with me, told me my options and supported me in any decision I made. He was patient and negotiated many deals with me instead of giving up with me when a deal didn’t work. Hopefully I won’t have to see him again for a while but he still checks in with how the car is and my satisfaction!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1546282286492, 'text': 'Thank you for sharing your experience and for your kind review, Daijhanai!

My experience here was okay. I did purchase a vehicle at a reasonable price but I did not get my spare tire & jack. When I called to ask about it I was told I didn't get it because I'm paying for roadside assistance, I'll be going back to get my tire & jack!!<//Review>

I leased a car from you guys and Paul Middleton was the guy that helped me out. He was great! He answered all my questions and really tried to give me the best deal he could and I really appreciated that. If you’re looking to buy or lease a car from Haddad Dodge, ask for Paul.</text>

<text>Horrible customer service in the Parts and Service Dept. My daughter needed the pin code for a locksmith to create another key. They gave her the run around and ultimately wouldn’t give it to her. Locksmith said Haddad Dodge is notorious for this. Cost us a lot more money because of this.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I went in for a specific car I had seen they had online, but when I got in later that night, it had already been sold. Simoneel immediately greeted me whenever I came into the lot and was incredibly helpful finding a different model that would work for me. She actually got me off the lot with a brand new car within my price range and helped me throughout the way, making my first car-buying experience wonderful. I was so happy I was helped by a woman who was looking out for my best interests. Thank you again, Simoneel!!!</text>

Received a recall for the driver air bag before taking the truck in received one for the passenger airbag.  When I brought the truck in could only do the driver side. Living out of state 6 months passed before we returned for the other. Our appointment was at 9am.  We were told 2 hours.  It has now been 2 1/2 hours.  Even though they have been very nice here.  Our morning is gone.<//text>

Matt was a great salesman. I pretty much knew what I wanted and didn't want when I came in. Color, services , etc. Matt made it happen. I appreciate a salesman that doesn't pressure you into buying something you don't want!!  Thanks Matt!! I love my Kia. I came out of a luncheon today and my car was parked across the street. My friend said "is that a Lexus?  ". I responded " no, it's s Kia, I saved $40,000". Love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️</Text>

Best experience buying a new vehicle ever! The team at Haddad Dodge are nothing short of fabulous! David Rodriguez was the salesman that sold my new truck to me. My credit is not the best by far and he went above and beyond to make it happen. I seriously think they just made me a lifelong customer. I wouldn’t consider going anywhere else.❤️❤️❤️<//review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>maybe it was a bad 2 weeks, but I left my car their on a monday for a check engine light. I was told it would be ready the next day. Sure, whatever. Thanks for the heads up. I pick up my car the next day and pay my dues and I'm good. 3 days later the stupid check engine light comes back on. I return to the service department. I'm told they'll look into it. I'm getting charged again. Fine. I'm not happy but just fix my car. This is Friday. A week goes by where I have to keep contacting them to see what the hold up is. It's always being looked at by a mechanic and it's always going to be ready today. A whole week! Finally, Tuesday, a little over a week after I dropped it off the second time, I get a call that it's ready. I swear if that light goes on again, I'm going to scream....and probably take my car elsewhere.</review><user>113429915465150646589</user></record></dataset><record>

I have bought many cars in my lifetime and had the absolute best experience at Haddad Dodge /Kia. Ismael was patient with me and never tried to put me in something I didn't need or want. The manager set the bar  by making sure I was comfortable with my payment. I will refer Haddad Dodge to everyone. And if you want a non pushy, knowledgeable, and everyday family friendly salesman to help ask for Ismael!</review>

Purchased a 2018 Kia Soul for my 17 year old daughter. We have been looking online for weeks ended up driving a Chevy Cruze and the Soul. She loved the Soul. Haddad has great customer service, no pressure.
We got a great deal, and you can’t beat the warranty! Thanks Haddad!<//text>

I was very satisfied with my service experience at Dodge. Compared to Northern California, Bakersfield was very friendly and the extra time Lupe took with us and gave our nephew a snack was awesome!!<//text>

Service advisors act like you are bothering them. I have dealt with this company only 3 times in the dozen+ years that I have owned Dodge trucks, and I have NEVER had a good experience with their service writers. I would rather drive to the Delano or Porterville Dodge dealers than deal with the arrogant and insolent behavior that one of them( the skinny blonde woman) exhibits constantly.
I had the wiring burn up the headlight switch module in my 2001 Dodge Ram. I asked one of the writers how much the repair would cost. She didn't know (she should have known), so she asked Miss Congeniality. She didn't know either, (What DO they know??) and said she would have to go ask one of the techs. She disappears into the service bay without so much as a by your leave, wanders out the back side, doesn't reappear for several minutes, strolls back in, has a 3 minute chat with one of the employees, disappears for another several minutes, then finally returns and informs me that the cost to repair my problem would be $290. I had already purchased a new switch module from an after market supplier. All I needed them to do was solder the connector plug back into the system, which would have taken less than an hour, since I already had the dash bezel and switch removed. I know dealers make their money off of labor, but charging for work they don't even have to do is outright thievery! And this place has thieves with attitude! Go elsewhere and don't get "lipped and ripped".</Text>

<Text>Excellent service. They know how to put the customer first. With that being Said they sold me a brand new car that had scratches in the paint and dings on the door. Also the inside was still dirty after they "detailed" it. Make sure to triple check your car before leaving the lot. Not looking forward to waiting 2 weeks and a whole day to get this issue fixed.

Sincerely an irritated customer.<//Text></record>

Took my 2016 Dodge Ram diesel in for service before an 1100 mile trip. 600 miles into the trip I investigated the antifreeze smell and the service men at Haddad had not replaced the cap on radiator reservoir!  Mess!  Finding a replacement wasn’t easy.

A few years back Haddad didn’t tighten the oil filter.   Come on Guys.<//Review>

4 days for a computer update.  The only vehicle in the house and they want it for 4 days.  You can't call and schedule an appointment because they're so slow abs backed up.  Insane,  just for a plug and play adaption.  I may love Dodge but this is stupid.</text>

<review>PLEASE READ.

This would be a 5-star review, but for the Finance department.

The sales people (Shout-out to Paul Middleton for amazing service) are friendly, courteous, passionate, and very knowledgeable. Paul got us into the Durango we wanted with very little hassle on the front end. Worked out a great price and handled the trade-in like a champ.  Follow-up service and even getting a new set of floor mats went without any notable issues.

Now, Xochitl in Finance is a completely different story. All rainbows and butterflies when we were going to finance through Dodge,   She lies to us saying that we’d have 5 days to arrange alternate financing if we found better rates. Well, we did decide to go with our own bank, and that’s where the Finance Department’s “service” drops like it’s been kicked off a precipitous cliff. I called on what should’ve been day 3 to find that they’d already processed the financing and sent it off to another bank, and that we’d have to go sign the paperwork again that day (because apparently weekends count as business days when you’re trying to lock a customer into a loan). I asked that the paperwork be ready to sign because we weren’t going to be able to get there until around 9 pm. She lied again saying it would be ready to go. Well we arrived at 9, and she had done nothing that we spoke about and left for the day hours before. I had to explain everything to a complete different person and do the entire process again.

So definitely shop here, the sales guys want to take care of you, just go in pre-approved with your auto-lender of choice or ask for someone that isn’t Xochitl when it’s time to Finance.< /review>< Resp>

<time>1444590831966</time><review>Let me first start off by telling you about our issue. We have a 2011 Dodge Ram 1500 4X4 that we purchased from Haddad Dodge in November of 2013. Our truck started just turning over and not starting. From time to time the fuel pump would stay running even after the truck was shut off and the key was out of the ignition. We did our research and found a star case issue with the same exact issue which lead us to the issue of our truck only turning over and not starting and the fuel pump staying on even with the truck off and the key out.

My husband went down and talked to David Owens the service manager and had the case information in had. My husband explained to Mr. Owens about what was going on in which Mr. Owens agreed that the issue was the fuel pump and the total integrated power module. Mr. Owen agreed that the fix was to put a relay outside of the total integrated power module. Mr. Owens advised that he would get the parts to us at cost and would charge us an hour of labor to get it done. Fast forward to Monday 10/05/15. I went and spoke to Mr. Owens about getting our truck in to be fixed. We agreed to have the work done on 10/07/15. My Husband and I dropped our vehicle off on Tuesday 10/06/15 at about 4:15-4:30 pm as we had conflicting schedules and wouldn't be able to drop it off today 10/07/15. At about 12:30 pm I received a call from Mr. Owen stating that our truck wouldn't start this morning so the technician preformed the work where our truck was parked when they moved it after we left on 10/06/15. Mr. Owens then informed me that after the work was done the truck still wouldn't start.

My husband and I went down to Haddad on his lunch at about 1:15 pm to pick up our vehicle. (before dropping our truck off we were able to get our truck started after 2-5 times of turning the key. The fuel pump would kick on and it would start) So, as I stated we went to go pick it up thinking that we would be able to get it started like we were so many times before. Well low and behold the fuel pump would not kick on at all no matter what we did. We were advised that Mr. Owens was out to lunch and they would have him give me a call. Well 3:40 pm rolls around and I finally get a call from Mr. Owens. We started talking about the new issue and things got very heated between us and I lost my cool, I asked him what they were going to do to fix the issue because our fuel pump in our truck turned on before leaving it with them and now it is mysteriously not turning on. Needless to say nothing came out of that converstation and he hung up. Fast forward an hour later Mr. Owens called me back now that we both have calmed down and is going to diagnose the issue tomorrow for us. Thank you for that Mr. Owens!

I gave three stars for now as he so far has been very willing to help even after me loosing my cool. Hopefully I can come back and update to five stars!

UPDATE:

Mr. Owens succeeded on getting our truck fixed. He really helped us restore our faith in humanity and car dealership service departments!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Service department sucks!
No communication back and forth .
I work at a auto collision center and it sucks how we need to use them for service and parts or else we would never go to them . Nicole did not help me out or even call me until 3 days later the car was there . They wouldnt answer or call me back until i told her we would just pick the car up thats when they got on it but even then they lagged and werent being honest.< /text>

<Review>Horrible service, from the service manager- try to give me the run around to score a few $$ more from me. Never give them a dollar again..

<Text>Terrible dealership. Very pushy and rude staff manager especially. EXTREMELY overpriced vehicles and they do not have a decent selection to choose from. They will tell you they found something similar to what you want from another dealership but could not find the exact one you want,  they will be lying to you. It is possible to get exactly what you want in the affordable price range you request from another dealership. I found the exact vehicle I wanted with an upgraded packed for a lower price elsewhere.<//Text>< userid>

I have been going to Haddad Dodge Ram (&Kia) ever since I was young. My Mom and Dad have bought every car they have owned there. I also bought my first and second car there! We have never been let down when we go to find a car, truck, or SUV. No matter if I was just sitting in the waiting room talking to some cool dealers, or handling finances and anything else with the them, Kannon and Joe have always helped us and they will not let you down. They always recommend the best cars and will get you what you want for the best deals. Kannon and Joe have always been our go to, and are absolutely helpful with everything. They can answer any questions you have & make sure you’re not leaving their lot with a piece of junk. They are not there to mess around, and if you want a serious dealer who will help you with everything you want and need, I would absolutely recommend the both of them! They are nice & like I said, can answer any type of question you have without a thought!<//text>

<review>This business is very rude and obnoxious. I took my company truck to have repairs done to it. I knew what was wrong and they tried to sell me over $1200 service that was not needed. When I told them that I did not want that done they got very belligerent. Obnoxious and rude with me and did not want to help me. The service person was Andrea and insisted that I have work done there was very unnecessary. I called a different company who assisted my needs very well . Me as a business owner will need Eric take my company truck is or any vehicle to Haddad Dodge again. JCW Statewide, INC< /review>< pictures>

I took my vehicle in for a recall, and was quoted a $20 repair. When I get to the dealership, I get a bill for $1,650.88

< review>
The worst service I have ever had for a vehicle I own is Haddad Dodge. If you make an appointment it means you get it in the door. An 8 o'clock appointment can be a eleven o'clock appointment. I had to return for a part that was a recall. It had taken less than 30 minutes to remove it at the last appointment. It took 2 and 1/2 hours to put it back on. My van had 4 recalls in the last 3 years. Plus other problems for which it has been in the shop. The service is slow when they tell you it will be done quickly, don't wait there. I tried to call to make an appointment today and it rang and rang until the operator came on 3 times. I finally had to hang up. My van is the example of an lemon. In the shop for too many repairs.< /review>

We have bought and leased cars through Kanon at the Kia dealership. He is a great help. He always works with us to get the best deal he can. All of our experiences there have been great and I would suggest stopping by there if you are looking for a new car.</Text>

Their rates don't even come close to what others can offer, they aren't very friendly in any way, shape, or form. I have a brand new 17 Durango R/T and I had it in for an oil change due to convenience while shopping and I was amazed at the fact there was no complimentary wash. This wasn't a make it or break thing but come on its brand new. The part that makes it bad is when the team forgets to put the air intake cover back on. Makes me wonder what else was done wrong or forgotten. Was my oil actually changed?< /Text>< username>

The Service Dept. will not take responsibility for their own mistakes, plus make sure that you remove any and all valuable from your vehicle.  I lost a $400.00 item. I would not reccomend Haddad Dodge Ram to a friend or even a non friend.</review>

<Text>I have had the worst time with the service department there at dodge. First when we took our Dodge  charger in for the recall notice it took all day for them to fix the issue, when it should have taken tops 2 hours, then i find out from the my dodge vehicle maintenance record that you guys put that you worked on the breaks and that was not authorized on my end. Your service department is trying to bill for things that was not supposed to be worked on. Top it off the freaken car shut off on us on the way back from Valencia, in the grapevine, and the error is about the freaken brakes that was never supposed to be worked on. I believe that your techs messed up on my new cars breaks, and tried to write it off saying you guys worked on the breaks. I have the report when i picked up my car that the service was done on the recall not on the breaks.</Text>< name>

<review>I brought my truck on Monday, 12/03, the staff told me it would take 2 days for it to be fixed, he called me Thursday that he would call me after the oil change but there was no call til Friday, not even an advisory that they are closed on Sat and Sun...I will be out of town again for a work from Monday-Thursday...No one can bring my truck back home once it's done til Friday.  AN OIL CHANGE for another 2 days? C'MON...I am not a happy customer...their staff seem to not care at all.  Honesty is a virtue on any business but this doesn't occur at Haddad Dodge...All they are good at is selling but when it comes to service...THUMBS DOWN.< /review>< userid>

We made an appt, and she was just as pleasant in person. She stuck with us as we look at other vehicles. Then she showed us ones with rebates and  was able to get us far more than we thought we could get.

I was given a price on a new red rt challenger for 39k before out the door costs 41k (written sales quote). I decided not to buy and took this information back home went online and saw internet price at 35k (same vin). Message me and I will forward screenshot of their on line price vs written price.

Went in there getting a trade appraisal on my car, Blake took care of me really good! This review is not on him, heck he deserves a pay raise. So after I was done with blake, i was walking back to my car, there was a salesman in between Kia and Dodge (Same Dealer) as we walked by he said "What'd you bring us?" I thought he meant what was i trading in so i said my mustang 5.0, he then continued to say that "i shouldve bought tacos instead" and started laughing ( I'm Hispanic) we were close to turning around and confronting him but was not worth our time. Continuing on, i contacted a manager and was told I'd get a call soon, next day, no call, had to text him. He then said another manager would call me in a few, no call. Really pathetic what a dealership lets slide just because he's a "top sales" will update once i have name of salesperson.</Text>

Two words that come to mind when thinking about this dealer is "pushy" and "manipulative". I had pre approved credit, but they kept pushing me to finance through them even though I clearly stated I'm not interested. They even went as far to say my Fico credit score is 30 points higher than it really is to entice me to run my credit with them. As irritating as that sounds, the real final straw for me with them is when they gave me a price for a 2017 car, and when I showed interest in a 2015 used car they pushed up the price of the 2017 to make it seem like the 2015 is a much better deal. If you're a fool and cool with people trying to play you, then go there thinking they're on your side.</Text>

<Text>The service department here has been very difficult to work with. First of all when the truck was first purchased I also purchased the extended warranty that was supposed to cover my vehicle bumper to bumper except tires and brakes. I have had the truck serviced 2 times, and those services were not covered. I had to have my truck towed in because it wouldn't start and the key would not come out of the ignition. They said it would be 3 weeks before they could even look at it and no a rental is not covered. It actually took a week for them to crack the hood open. They tell me that the car alarm is draining the battery and they don't cover that. I bought the alarm from Haddad and they installed it. The price tag from this visit is almost $400. I said no way, this better be covered in the warranty. He said he will check with his boss. 2 days later we find out that it's the fuel pump which has to be ordered from LA and they will cover that. So 5 days later, it's ready, the total $2300, but covered. Get home, park, start to leave again,  won"t start just like before. The service people really need to first learn some customer service skills, then understand their own policies and maybe go back to car maintenance school. Humbly my opinion! Though I hope to get my car back this month... Btw 2 Stars because they do sale quality vehicles.< /Text>< pictures>

Yesterday after conferring with Gisele by phone my son and I went to see what they had to offer. After meeting Gisele we were referred to a sales associate named Joe (John J.) Gonzales who listened to us first; what we wanted car-wise, price-wise, even down to colors we did or didn't like. He then took us to all of their lots to look. We picked out a couple pre-owned cars we liked and were given pricing, financial options, etc.; then we were given pricing on new models as well. We truly feel like we formed a bond with all the associates who worked hard to get the pricing, payments, color, etc. that we were interested in and we drove home in a brand new 2016 KIA Optima.

< Review>
Awful,  dropped my truck off with a 4x4 problem,  and two safety recalls. Got my truck back with the same problem and my alignment was off terribly,  from work done on the recall. My truck was not test drove for quality assurance, and the 4x4 light was still flashing. I could not be more disappointed with the service I received.  The service manager said sorry though... oh ya still had to pay full price and I had to bring my truck back 3 times now.  Oh by the way,  I'm over an hour from the dealership.  I though dodge meant quality,  well not today.<//Review>

<Text>I would never recommend this place they take advantage of young people they tell you one thing and then they keep changing and changing and try to speed you through the process before you even realize what has happened. They never give you a straight answer and I basically was called immature for not paying close enough attention. I counted on their word trusted what they were saying and that's not what was given they are unhonest. Never go here I highly suggest you go somewhere else I didn't have this issue at C&a motors they let me know everything upfront with my other vehicle.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>Sold me a BRAND NEW truck that started showing "immediate service/repair needed" ON THE WAY HOME. Immediately contacted them and told them I wanted to swap out for a NEW truck (which is what I paid for-not a refurbished one). They refused. Ram customer service said only dealership can make that call. So they sold me a lemon I can only imagine they knew was messed up (as soon as they hooked it to computer "all kinds of crazy codes" popped up) and now they wont replace it...ad I have been driving a crummy rental for a week now instead of a new Ram Rebel. VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER.<//Text>< response>

<Review>I purchased a Dodge Ram 2500 Long Horn from Haddad Dodge and up until recently was very satisfied with the truck.  After the last service we will not be coming back.  I called to make an appointment for routine maintenance, two recall items, and a couple of minor items that needed to be fixed.    The appointment was made several weeks and I was told to bring the truck in early so everything could be done in one day.  We live 70 miles away.

I brought the truck in on Thursday, 1-23-14.  They said it should be done by 3 or 4 pm.  I was given a car per my contract.  Around 5 pm I went back to the dealer to see what was going on and was told they would need to keep it another day to finish all the items.  Sure wish they would have called so I could have gone home earlier.  Next day I called around noon, since no one had called me.  They said it should be done by 2 pm.  Left my house at 1 and arrived at the dealer a little after 2.  I was told it was not done and give them until 4 to finish.  Waited for the call but it never came...went back to the dealer at 5 and was told it was just about ready.  They told me to return the rental and when I got back it would be done.  After getting the rental car checked in they called (hey...phone does work) and told me to keep the car because my truck was not ready.  I went back to the dealer and he said there was another page they had not seen and none of that work was done yet.  Also he told me they had called the warranty company and the left side windshield washer nozzle were not covered by the extended warranty because they were cosmetic; it does not function properly.

This really upset me because I was told the extended warranty that I purchased from the dealer at the time of the sale had the same coverage as the initial warranty.  I do not have the technical expertise to evaluate a warranty contract and so have to place my trust in the dealership; a mistake I will not make again.  It's ironic because the right side nozzle did the same thing and was replaced by them under warranty six months before.  The left side broke a month later (at about 35K miles) but I figured I would wait until the next scheduled service to get it fixed since I had the extended warranty.  We go to Bakersfield a couple times a month so I could have had it fixed under warranty had I known it would not be covered.

So I was told my truck would be ready on Monday or Tuesday.  Did not hear from anyone so I called on Tuesday and was told it was ready to go.  Let me be clear that I understand extra time will be necessary when unexpected problems come up.  However, there were no issues of that nature in this incident.  The only work done was what was scheduled;  less actually.  Five days to complete what I was told could be done in one.

There was a thick layer of dust over the entire interior;  not sure how so much dust could have got in there unless it was left with the windows open outside.  I went into the service office to tell them but several people were in line and a car was honking for me to move so I just left figuring what's the point; not like I'm coming back anyway.

Some may say I should not have a problem with the time issue because I had a "free" car.  However, I purchased a top of the line truck, not an entry level stripped to the bone car.  There is also two unnecessary round trips to Bakersfield that cost me time and gas; not to mention the time doing nothing in Bakersfield because they were too busy to call me and tell me they needed more time. I know they are busy; but a 1 minute call could have saved me hours. I am fairly meticulous about keeping my truck clean.  I expect it to get a little dirty during service but this thick layer of dust was unfathomable.

The issue on the extended warranty, the total disregard for my personal time by the service staff, and the condition of my truck when it was returned to me is beyond my tolerance so we will not be returning to this dealership.</Review>< Pics>

made an appt a week earlier and found out it meant nothing. Had the code recorded and a week later at my appt. she told me it wont do any good if the engine light wasn't on. The man earlier that checked it out said it doesn't matter now that we see it. This place is trash. Going to Lampe Dodge from now on. Remember, appointments mean nothing.</review>

My last experience was with Matt who was a tremendous help, and to feel you in I am a very picky customer to deal with! It took me a full month do decide what I wanted and he never became pushy or rude and upset with me. Matt helped me with a difficult situation, I chose a car and didn’t like it, Matt helped me to get into the car a really wanted without any extra $$$ lost!! All of the staff was helpful in a “This never has happened before” situation! I encourage anyone looking for a new vehicle for the New Years Sales to go to Haddad Dodge/Kia and ask for Matt!

< review>
I recently purchased a 2015 Kia Soul from this fine establishment. I’ve known this place for quite a long time and can genuinely attest to the love and care they put into every single deal and customer that comes through their lot. I bought my Soul from Kanon Sawyer, a fine man, genuine very fair and all around great guy that’ll have you believing he’s your brother by the end of the deal. The whole crew at the dealership is wonderfully integrable and I was very satisfied with my service.<//review>

< Review>
I asked the car dealer to find me an suv under $400 a month and after he takes me to test drive the car and pretty much sells me it he comes back with a $500 monthly payment. So i got lied to the entire time. I wasted my whole night i am 8 months pregnant and needed a car asap they obviously dont want to make money here. They dont know how to do math at all if you tell them a certin amount expect it to be $300 over</Review>

<Text>Pam!!! She's a salesperson at, Kia, and she was amazingly helpful. She wasn't pushy like other places and she listened to us. She made sure we got the best deal possible. David in finance was helpful to. He explained everything, every step of the way. My family and I didn't expect to purchase a car that, day, let alone from Kia. Not because they are bad cars but for other personal reasons. In the end, we're very happy with our brand-new 2019 Kia Sportage. Thanks Kia/Haddad Dodge.<//Text></record>

<username>Pedro Aceves< /username><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>DO NOT come to this dealer and deal with any of the dealers. Especially salesman Juan Carlos Rivera. He barely speaks English. Could barely complete my paperwork. Had to continuously ask for help from his co-workers to complete paperwork. He will promise all the rebates and discount plus make all the promises he needs to in order to run your credit and deny saying he made any promises, shrug his shoulders and say he is sorry.

I repeat, DO NOT come to Haddad Dodge. They will run your credit through 6 different banks and you will go down 20 points as I did. Chose a more honest and reliable Brand and Dealer such as Sangera Subaru right across the street. You will not regret it as I did. I went straight across the street to Subaru and walked out with a 2017 Subaru Impreza with a 6% interest rate and $250 car payment right after Haddad Dodge had treated me so rudely and shiestly.

If you do decide to come anyway to Haddad Dodge, good luck.

Sincerely,

New Subaru Owner.< /Review><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80ea6aa30a6c6ee1:0x50dc6ae58936d8ea<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Best customer service I have ever experienced in my life!

On 10/1/15 My Kids – 18 & 20 years old were driving my car to LA from Sonoma County.  My car’s transmission light came on.  The Kids were on I-5 in Bakersfield. My Kids pulled over immediately and turned he car off.  They knew something was really wrong! The kids called me to let me know what was happening.  This was a very big issue.  I looked up the owner’s manual and it shows the warnings noted below:

“Continuous driving with the Transmission Temperature Warning Light illuminated will eventually cause severe transmission damage or transmission failure.” AND “If the Transmission Temperature Warning Light is illuminated and you continue operating the vehicle, in some circumstances you could cause the fluid to boil over, come in contact with hot engine or exhaust components and cause a fire”

As you can imagine when I read this warning – as a Mom – I freaked out.  My kids are about 350 miles away from home with no one to help.  I “Googled” Dodge in Bakersfield.  I called at about 2PM and got a gentleman by the name of Chris in the service department.  I explained my situation that my boys were on I-5 and my car was in bad shape.  Keep in mind – one of my Boys is on leave from the ARMY and needs to be home 10/2/15 to catch his flight to get back to base.  Chris took immediate action to help my Kids.  It was amazing!  My Kids got the car to cool down – they drove to the dealership.  Chris got my car looked at immediately.  Chris called me at 4:30PM and explained that my transmission needed to be serviced, but they could not do it because it was so hot it could not be done until 10/2/15 after it cooled.  WOW he took care of my car in 2 ½ hours – Really?  No one dose that – not even independent shops!

Now: Here is the great part!  He put my Kids on a shuttle and got them to a hotel to stay the night while my car cooled.  At 10AM on 10/2/15 Chris called me – the car was done!  WOW!  Chris sent the shuttle over to the hotel to get my Kids. We took care of the bill and the Kids were off to get the items they were going to LA to get and my Kiddo will be home in time to catch his flight!  – THANK GOD!

I can never thank Chris at Haddad Dodge Bakersfield enough.  Any and All of the Mom’s and Dad’s out there can understand how important it is to know your kids are safe – no matter what the age!  My Kids were in great hands with Chris going over and above the highest mountain to help my Kids and get my soldier home in time to get back to base after leave to serve our country.

I am in debited to Chris at Haddad Dodge in Bakersfield – I hope that I can do something for him one day.

Thank you Chris – you have made such a difference in our lives!<//review>

I have to agree with the folks that left negative reviews. This is the worst place on the planet to take a vehicle for any warranty work and most likely anything else. I have been trying to get some warranty work along with some recall repairs out of the way and no luck. Every time I call they say they will return my call and nothing. They are supposed to follow up when parts come in and cannot manage that either. I am a customer, yet I am treated like I am hassling them through every scenario. Paso has opened up a new dealership so I may reach out to them in the future. It is too bad I cannot rate  zero stars!  if not for me, help your future customers out by hiring a new Service Manager.< /Text>

< Review>
I made an appointment a week I'm advance for 10 am. I specifically asked how long a recall replacement part would take. I was told two hours. I drove over 1 hour to be told it would take over night. This is complete and total nonsense. You would think professionals knowing you are driving over an hour away would let you know you may need a ride. Especially since I asked and went out of my way to find out. Terrible terrible service. So I went back after my wife urged me to talk to the manager and explain our situation. So I spoke to the customer relations manager Neomi she than went on to waste another 30 min of my time explaining they have no loaner cars, they can't move any faster, she stated " we just have to many recalls and not enough techs" (not my problem when I made an appointment a week in advance and asked) she than also stated " I'm sorry it was a nee girl that made a mistake" again..... if an employee made a mistake where I work we do anything to fix it. I was just td sorry and given a smile basically being told to bad for you we cannot help you even though you wasted 3 hours of driving time and gas and an hour with our apologies with no solution. I literally can't believe it. I've never seen a business in sales and service preform so poorly.<//Review>

<review>I don't have anything nice to say about this place. Trust me, don't EVER buy a car or have their incompetent service department work on your vehicle. They don't understand "quality service" or know how to fix a intermitten reoccuring problem in a new car!

<review>I purchased my new car from Haddad , a 2015 kia...very sporty and very clean. Very little miles on it. My credit is not the greatest and i walked away with my car..the customer service is amazing, they do not try to push you to get into something you dont want. They are more like consultans not a sales man. I know that i will be getting my next vehicle from Haddad. My payments are very affordable aswell. I am one happy custome.  Thank you Joe. 😁<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
CROOKS!!
Had a bad experience years ago with a pushy sales manager but i decided to give them another shot.
Salesman sold me an extended hi tech warrantee that he claimed covered everything for $2799.00.
Car was sold to me with bad shocks that ruined the tires. The ac never worked right. The battery was bad. The dash is buckling and my battery in the key died within a week. They just told me nothin is covered.
Not much has changed in 20 year's.  DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM THESE CROOKS!!!<//Review>

<Review>We purchased 2 vehicles from the dealership with a multiple vehicle trade in. The experience was pleasant and our salesman was very helpfull. This makes the 5th vehicle that we have purchased from hadad. We was interested in another purchase for my daughter that wasn't feasible i guess. I have concerns with the kia part of the dealership as we was astonished ny the upside down from my daughter's car that made it not possible for her to step in ro anothe car with us. The dodge dealership and sales was very pleasant though</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

< Review>
I went to 3 other dealerships to look for a car to possibly buy. After going to the other big dealerships and being treated not so nicely ( my only guess is because it's due to me wearing capris and a baggy t shirt and shoes with no socks, but it's my day off and I hadn't planned on making a purchase today I was just dressed comfortable)but when I got to haddad dodge I was greeted so nicely by Kirk and he showed me all the car could do and worked with me and got me a deal I had to have the car . I know have it home and am so glad I made the purchase . Thankyou Kirk and I will only be going to this dealership from now on and will refer everyone to Kirk. It shows you being nice pays off 😊thank you Kirk you are awsome . By Christy< /Review>

I purchased a 2016 journey, at the end of july 2017, with 5,000 miles on it. After I left the dealership I started having issues with my car. And since we were told by our salesman that we are covered bumper to bumper for 3 months after purchase, I decided to turn it in and see what's going on. Now, this is only 4 weeks after I purchased the vehicle. I get a phone call telling me that there is no such thing as a 3 month bumper to bumper warranty. Let alone a bumper to bumper to begin with. DO NOT purchase from this dealership. I had reservations to begin with and I wish I would have followed my instincts.< /text>

Kanon always makes us feel that he has our best interests at heart. I was referred to Kanon by a previous sales manager for the company many years ago and I have been coming to him every since, as well as I have referred my own children and many friends to him. He has knowledge about any auto I choose to purchase always makes sure Iget everything I need and want. You couldnt ask for better service when it comes to buying a new vehicle.

<userid>108592983223502222466< /userid><review>Bought my Ram 1500 Laramie  4X4 brand new in 2013. Had five open recalls  on my truck, and my dash cluster started to flicker after the first "update" so i decided to make an appt. Soonest available was two weeks out (7/7/16). What else was i supposed to do so  i booked the appt. Took seven days after I dropped my truck off for Haddad to even  diagnosis it (7/14/16). Which is when they told me my radio was blacked out and my cluster would have to be replaced @ 2000 plus dollars. (The radio had zero problems and blacked out when they tried to update it) Took them another week to get my clusters. My steering coloum was scratched when they installed the new clusters. They were supposed to have the new radio in on 7/21 and my truck back to me on 7/22/16. Radio didn't come in and i needed my truck for the weekend. On 7/23/16 my brand new cluster that i paid $1000 for started flickering again. (A quick google search, revealed that this is a common problem with the 2013 ram 1500). Dealer told me my radio would be shipped now on 7/26, multiple calls and voicemail to  my service consultant have gone unanswered. Haddad had my truck for 15 days fixed nothing and caused more damage. Not to mention another $1000 dollars spent in a rental car for NOTHING.  7/27 I'm still waiting for a call back or for someone to help me.</review><date>1469648220436</date><response>None</response><Rating>1< /Rating>< Pics>

<Review>My 2015 challenger has been in the shop four times now... well within my warranty period for a/c problems, three of the four visits took an unconscionable amount of time (nearly a month).
In fact, it has been in the shop for 12.5% of my ownership and I suspect that by January/February I will have to come back.

It leaves a bitter taste in my mouth knowing that I've paid my car payment on time, every month, and for nearly 3 months in my ownership I did not have the car in my possession.  Why did I have to pay over $1500.00 in payments on a car I couldn't even use?

I tried calling Haddad just now and they couldn't even find my car in their system, or any information regarding the service that I can only assume they are currently performing.  I will now be seeking legal counsel and will file a Lemon Law complaint.<//Review>< user_name>

I took my vehicle in for a diagnostic and they told me it would be ready the next day, I called them back two days later and James in services said the results weren't ready, after two full days. He also said he would call me back that same day and never did. This place is terrible please go somewhere else do not leave your car here because they will take it and use it as there own vehicle< /review>

So we bought a 2015 caravan and it had a broken floor compartment door and the sales man said it would be replaced and we would get a call when it was ready months went by and nothing happened so i called and said the guy doesn't work for them anymore after going thru a few people the manager said ok fix it so the service manager said he would  call us when they get the part months went by again we call and they said the service manager doesn't work there anymore so they dont know what we are talking about  so we start all over again we bring it to them  but this time we said something else is wrong  something with the transmission  and also my ac is not working and making alot of noise so they said it would take a week and a half to get everything fixed  so 10 days go by and we dont get a call or nothing so we come by the dealer and they said "oh  your van has been ready since last Friday " and only the transmission work was done the door on the floor and the ac is still not fixed its on a written work order  how can this happen i hope the manager really reads all the reviews because i only see response to the ones with good rating< /Text>

<review>I brought my Dodge Ram in because the air conditioner was not working properly.   When I called in for the appointment I was given a 3 week appt.  It has been in the triple digits and I had to drive my hot truck in that and it was miserable. After waiting three weeks  I finally took my vehicle in;  I was first in line first one t here. I have an extended warranty and was told that it would be a $50.00 deductible.  Being a single woman I don't have alot of money and told them to please let me know before any work is done as I needed to make sure I would have the funds.   I had to get the shuttle to take me to work and heard nothing all day from my consultant Tony.  I had to call at the end of my work day to be told that they could not get to it that day.  Had to find a ride home and a ride to work the next day.   The next day I heard nothing and no one called me back.  I left a message for the service manager Chris,  he did call back but when I noticed the call it was after six and I thought they were closed.   The next day I called early and was told that they had found some plastic trash bags that were in my glove box had got sucked into the  air conditioning.  I asked how can this be as I thought the glove box was sealed and that anything I put in there would be safe from being sucked into the motor.   I asked how was I supposed to know that this could happen?  I was never informed and further they told me that the warranty would not cover this and that I had to pay the one hour service fee.  I told them that I didn't have the money and that after waiting three weeks for an appt and not being told what was the problem until after they pulled the trash bags out I couldn't pay them.  Chris said that there was nothing he could do; I said  I was upset that something like this could not have been resolved and how could he help me.   He acted like he didn't care, he brought it down 15.00 which was still way too much for me., as I had to get a payday loan to pay for this.   I told him I wold never buy another Dodge from them and he said.  "Thats fine Mam".    huh?   no trying to work with me ?    I will not buy or take my care for service there again.  The customer service is bad,  they don't care to help you resolve the issues.    I am still upset about this.   It's not only the money and the fact that I am going without until my next pay day, it's the fact that they don't treat you with good customer service that they should be ashamed of themselves.   .< /review></record>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>HORRIBLE SERVICE. Why cant I give no stars? We took our Durango in for a complete electrical failure. We were told our vehicle would most likely be diagnosed within 2 days. Mind you, the warranty doesnt authorize a rental car until the vehicle is diagnosed. Our Durango was in their shop for 3 WEEKS before they diagnosed the problem as the alternator (Which was not underlying problem as anyone with a little automotive knowledge could guess). They sent my wife on the road after replacing the alternator, saying everything is fixed. She asked if the PCM and TIPM (similar problems online indicated those items) were checked, She was guaranteed everything was checked and in working order.

On the way home from the dealership, my wife picked up our kids from school. What happens next... The same problem, complete electrical failure AGAIN (Mind you, She just picked up the car from the UnService Dept. an hour prior) The scariest thing was the power steering went out, among other electrical systems. We travel the Canyon quite regularly, and expect a dealership to know their vehicles. That is not the case with Haddad Dodge Service.

The next morning (Friday), the vehicle was towed back to Haddad Dodge. We were told the vehicle would go to the front of the line for service (Really?!?) We spoke with the Service Advisor Manny, Service Manager Chris and who we think was the Operations Director Howard. Every one of them is all lip service, All Talk and no action. The Service Manager Chris even said, this time he is going to put a mechanic on our vehicle that "HE TRUSTS". Shouldnt he trust all of his mechanics with their customers lives??? We are assured we would receive an update on Monday and given a loaner car (the air conditioning didnt work well, needed to be recharged).

Monday came and went and no call, but we weren't surprised, based on the 3 week wait last time. Tue, wed Thurs. My wife leaves messages for the Service Advisor Manny, Service Manager Chris, Operations Guy Howard...none of the calls are returned.

Friday Morning (A week after going back the 2nd time) I call Manny, Moe and Jack, and also leave messages at 8am. By 11am I have not heard from any of them. I then spoke to Shannon, not sure her position, but supposedly above Howard the Operations guy. I explain the problem and she says she is going to check into it. Then I get a call from a SALES MANAGER Cesar....UH, Im not buying a car from Haddad if they cant get their crap together in service. Apparently Cesar is their customer whisperer. Whatever, He tells me the problem the 2nd time is the ...wait for it...the alternator. I told him, that's ridiculous and a moron with minimal car knowledge will tell you that's not the problem, He proceeds to tell me THREE Mechanics have looked at it and confirm its the alternator. OK, But I guarantee its not going to fix the problem!

Shortly after I spoke with Cesar, Shannon called and slipped up. She told me Cesar would be calling me with information and he would be our new point of contact (a Sales Manager the contact for the Service Dept). I told her that I just spoke with him, she replied, "Ok, so you are happy someone called you back now" Um No, there is still a problem, but im sorry to bother YOU with YOUR service departments inability!

So after all that, the Service Advisor finally called on Monday and said they replaced the alternator and it failed as well. Once again they were asked about the TIPM and PCM. He advised they are going to check those items, as well as the battery we just replaced because the alternator destroyed the battery.

Low and behold, The PCM was faulty. So three alternators, a battery and roller coaster ride of crappy service, the car is fixed! BUT We are not done yet, The push button Start ring is gouged from where they forcefully tried to remove the key and there are greasy hand prints all over the A pillar upholstery.

Use your judgement going here for service. There is a Chrysler dealership right down the street that can work on Dodge products.< /Text>< Response>

<Text>If there were negative stars that what I would rate them. Worst dealer I have been to in the nation. Customer service SUCKS. Service department is even worse. Dishonest, liars. DO NOT have work done on your vehicles, their lack of communication and follow through with work requests is unbelievable. Sad they are the only dealership in the area they should be shut down.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Really bad customer service. I was given an appointment on a saturday and drove 40 minutes and when i arrived they told me they didnt have the part needed that day. took car next monday and was told it would take 4 hrs, called them for an update and then told it wouldnt be ready until the next day. i had to find a ride. then i took another car in and was told the same thing. it will be ready in 2 hrs, once again, no update on the status of the car, i called and then was told that it wouldnt be ready until the next day. i had an extended service where i would get a car rental. the guy that helped me plain out say, that doesnt apply here without even checking for me. never againg will i take my car in for service at this place.< /review>

last year i purchased a 2014 dodge Durango Rallye and it drives like it looks..... great, i take it on a regular basis tune up tire rotation and the customer service is great, the negative is the time i took it to get detailed and interior shampooed it took like 2 hrs. then about 6 months later i went in for the same detail job and they said it would take them 3 days so the carpet can dry.... whats up with that?!!!! i spent close to 300 dollars the first time and it took only 2 hrs. and now its 3 days.I think i got ripped off the first time (thinking about changing the rating), sales person (i dont want to give a name because he was a good guy and salesman) that sold us the car said he would give my family each Mopar hats and the back seat floor mat as well and still have not received anything and have not seen him since</text>

I was looking for a particular truck and my search led me to Haddad Dodge. Through their internet sales department they were advertising the exact truck I was looking for at the price point I was wanting to pay.  I initiated contacted with Steven, their internet sales representative, and learned the truck was still on the lot.  He emailed me the window sticker to confirm everything and I committed to buy.  Unfortunately, the dealership was about to close so we decided to pick up where we left off at 9am. First thing the next morning, I filled out the on-line credit approval and Steven was impressed with my FICO score, which was going to get me a better interest rate. About an hour went by and I was waiting to hear from Steven so I could drive to the dealership.  When I asked how it was going Steven advised me something came up.  Their Fleet Manager had a customer come in who wanted to purchase the same truck. Because the Fleet Manager had seniority, he was trumping my purchase.  Steven said the General Manager was getting involved and he would have a decision for me in a bit.  Well, needless to say, based on how many stars I gave you can figure out what happened.  Why even have an internet sales department if you're going to treat a customer in this manner.  You may have years of experience and enough awards to paper a whole wall of your business but poor customer service is not only a bad business practice but it is unethical as well. The organizations culture, maturity of management and the willingness to do the right thing defines a successful organization.  You have some work to do Haddad Dodge-Ram.<//text>

Horrible, horrible customer service with the service department. Rude staff, inability -- or unwillingness -- to provide pertinent information, etc.

We've been thinking about trading our 2013 Durango in for a truck, and the ONE think making us leery of going with a Ram is Haddad's service.

People: it's called customer "service" for a reason. Please evaluate your practices and interactions with customers and strive for excellence because mediocrity just isn't cutting it.< /Text>

His customer service skills is a joke, don't ever go there and ask for him he is rude and very un-professional, he told me that it would probably take 4-5 hours so I said ok and waited well come to find out it took 9 hours I sat there that long and he only came once to give me an update I was very fustrated with this dealership, customer service is something they lack.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Everything was great as always with the service, sales, and vehicles. I felt like everyone from sales to finance worked together the help me get the car that I wanted. I would like send special thanks to my salesman, Anthony Greene., I really appreciated the follow up after my purchase and attention to detail. Also, a thanks to Mike and David for making it happen after we found my car. The hard work was much appreciated. Thank you Haddad Dodge! #TeamWorkMakesTheDreamWork</review>

Updated: Jonathan Mojarra was exceptional, professional and very knowledgeable. The process was quick and easy and they listened to what I wanted in a car.  On May 24th I came back to have my seats changed to leather, they gave me a rental car that was no of my standard which smelled, was filthy on the inside, and had an empty tank which I ran out of gas within a few miles because I didn’t think to check the gas level before pulling off.  I don’t blame the company, I blame the management team whom I obviously offended in the prior days…. whom allowed the unprofessional gentleman arrange for me a car that would not only offend but cause me stress along the way.  I called the dealership and informed them of the incident and was disregarded and left on hold.< /Review>

This is a dealer with excellent customer service. I especially want to acknowledge the department of service in which David Hernandez helped me.
