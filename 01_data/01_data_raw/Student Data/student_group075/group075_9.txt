<rating>5</rating><review>There are three places to enjoy the great view that Ansel Adams made famous:
1. From the parking lot just outside the Wawona Tunnel on the highway 41. This is the easiest and does not require any hiking.
2. From Artist Point on the old Wawona Road, which requires you to hike 2miles with an elevation of 500 feet.
3. From Inspiration Point on pohono trail, it is a 2.6 mile hike with an elevation of 950 feet.

Form all three places, you have the similar vista of El Capitan, Half Dome, and Bridalview Fall.
The reason people take the hike to artist point and inspiration point is there are far fewer people at these vista points.

The Artist Point trail started from the Tunnel View parking lot, the first half mile is the Pohono Trail (same for Inspiration Point Trail). It is a very steep incline and switchback.
You will gain 500 feet very quickly, Then you will meet the cross road of pohono and the old stagecoach road (i.e the old wawona road).  There are signs at cross road, just make a left turn at the intersection and you will be fine. Continue 0.5 mile you will reach the Artist Point (one more mile will send you to the bridalveil fall parking area where old wanowa road meets the new wawona road). The final 0.25 mile is all  downhill with about 200 feet elveation.

There is no sign of the point, but you can not miss it. If you are lucky, most likely you will be the only one at the spot. It is a great place to take some serious photos.
If you visit the place in April or May, do continue another 50 yards, you will see a small waterfall run cross the trail.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3AGwibatB8-C7lSy71xXS60X36qcknrMXLkYU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSmRJKxiSOk1csJi69l3TjzlrHe4E5BmNEiOAD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxj_wMQuEXPPvxsRmrIPu127zaVB1z65OG3idL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjIN6l8gcPlCoWzkE59Ejm1ID4BVf3iqr1pHwb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsGym5er-9bfBsIlvdRwEwtcHVRH09BwI01-QO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOk2CVjg4BSY7goNQM1IqIudhcALjRQ_8_d0UWu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3g2xN--bBf7-nhku7I4oLwSOSemCAcylwIgk-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMa1OfP-3EtzBk9Oq_lco1I6NEGy9ewqeVL0Jf5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKy8n6EzlceU8IQb29gy-1855uB-_91GjnBKan=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMq41kkwqpGU0SuRGz9CXnUXf5rNWJ9HPw4JR91=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZMN3v62GzXm-8r45eBfM6obnSrCRpQ1ZU3UsG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOUTnueqO8-cjlM4NQUj9TyMMlUsuiyIdAIwd-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

<Time>1507604977256</Time><rating>5<//rating><Review>This is a "real" hidden gem!   After exiting the Wawona Tunnel driving towards Yosemite Valley, turn into the left parking lot or the right side parking lot.  At Tunnel View, large crowds assemble for this outstanding view.  Try the right side parking lot if possible.  There, about half way down the parking lot, you will see some steps going up to the Pohono Trail.  This is the beginning of the Artist Point Trail.

The first 6/10 mile is fairly steep with some views of Yosemite Valley.  At 6/10 mile, you will come upon an old stagecoach road.   There will be a sign here pointing straight to continue to the Inspiration Point vista.  BUT, at this stagecoach road, turn LEFT (when we were there no sign was in place for Artist Point) and then descend a bit for 1/2 mile.   At some places you will have to climb over fallen trees.  You will definitely notice the Artist Point vista to the left with a steep uphill rock formation to the right.

There is a nice bench type rock for pictures and to rest.  Do this hike.  When we were there in September 2017, there was no one else there!  Outstanding views (without the crowds)!    View:  El Capitan, Cloud's Rest, Bridalveil Fall, Half Dome.  Elevation at parking lot:  4390'; elevation at Artist Point: 4701'.   The round-trip hike is 2.2 miles.    Highly recommended and a somewhat tough hiking going up for the first 6/10 mile of your hike.  Take some water and your camera!</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQwmDHDIm4DO8PwQ7iLzK-4Lh_LsNnPqtSiWnj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLokP3pDmBNWmqIM6QG1zucjPpWwKUuKdh2uSp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

<Review>If you want to see the Milky Way at the Tunnel View, check the date and time of moon set. You will need a tripod, a good camera with time exposure, a chair, and other camera essentials.  Just enjoy the sky filled with bright stars!< /Review><Name>J W</Name>< Date>

<date>1529641067993</date><review>Beautiful, short hike. We walked a bit further on the pohono trail before we went to the Artist Point and the views were stunning from above as well. But the Artist Point has unobstructed views on the valley and were breathtaking. Highly recommend this hike for people that want to do a easy trail. We went mid June and there was no one else on the trail! Great time to come to Yosemite to get amazing weather and before the crowds arrive.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIH0zn8-QBvw4wrN9jAOb0MZXdw_elk3XXnNkO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Rate>

Amazing short hike to the Point. Very secluded compared to tunnel view, I only saw four people on the trail.  The road is right there,but I can't help but think this is closer to how  Muir saw it...< /review>

Der Artist Point ist ein Aussichtspunkt am Rand einer Klippe und kurz vor dem Tunnel und wurde ursprünglich 1883 von Frank Jay Haynes benannt, der zu Unrecht glaubte, dass der Ort der Ort war, an dem der Maler Thomas Moran 1872 seine Darstellungen der Wasserfälle entwarf. Spätere Arbeiten stellten man dann fest, dass die Skizzen vom Nordrand aus angefertigt wurden, der Name Artist Point blieb jedoch erhalten.
Von dort aus kann man aber auch einige Wanderrouten starten.  Der eine Rundweg ist etwa 5,5 km bei dem man etwa 1,5 bis 2 Std. benötigt. Oder man nimmt den größeren mit etwa 34 km, bei dem man schon eher früher beginnen sollte.
Da man hier gut parken kann und es hier genügend Parkpläteze gibt, kann man hier sehr gut mit den Wanderrouten starten.
Oder man sieht sich einfach das schöne Panorama von der anderen Straßenseite aus an, wobei man im Frühjahr die Wasserfälle besser sehen kann.

Or you can just look at the beautiful panorama from the other side of the street and see the waterfalls better in spring.</review><Response>None<//Response><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDNQuDHAzRVrONSsioVE63oWEmdwtGLDelhngB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcAIrcERnTU2nE3HCvECh4EpwsEgEX5ZX5Ju8w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUB-HcUyfJTwOYLpYVwng9uVcJ6GWXpOd2uNIO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-KRs-r-pdlJ7gfp5C7mKupaPeWjYsg9QsqJhw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcV047n_pX0ysW3fzLNrFuF19w27ROtJ0ULmHJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxiEJRrJo8kf6iOQuRJn_EPI7QFR2uTCHMfHUs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZHaPgRMP6QVJdb_uzFlqX7lYLNRgqam7wbTgl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYk49S4wr_sGvTMntfEswaMraTY38OKk31mMIB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJ96ghv-FKqwaJd7bK75FrqoMjmC-7YlJNs9W-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><date>1576473604429<//date></record>

I was attended by Miguel, my first visit ever. Miguel was very attentive and had a conversation with me about what I was looking for, what changes did I need and questions around style Etc. After getting a clear understanding of what I was looking for in a haircut he took his time and pay meticulous attention to detail. I have to tell you that this is one of the best haircuts I've ever had in my life. Downtown Barbers has a new client and I will be back for my regular haircuts in the future. If you're looking for experts, someone that pays attention to detail, someone who listens to you and what you're looking for, then this is the place for you.<//text>

<review>Fast and Quick trim, called the spot and the homies advised I need an appointment which is pretty normal, but they took me right away for my kid! Gave him a nice fade and made him happy, nice places clean and sanitized. Thanks Fellas!</review>< Pics>

The place appeared clean, well organized my hair cut was as I requested it, it is by appointment even though they did cut my hair, it was organized but, they kept themselves at a distance and I got no greeting com or going not even a FY, nothing, so I will look for another barber shop,. 👍</Text>

<response>None</response><Review>Carlos is awesome. I sat in his chair today for the second time and within just minutes, my beard looked much better. He listens to what i want and trims accordingly. The magic touch.....   Although i have a shaved head, the other haircuts i see him do are great. Very sharp and clean. Get an appointment because the shop is usually busy. Cash only and the ATM in the back was offline. Bring your bucks, sit back in his chair, and let Carlos the Wizard do his magic.</Review><rate>5</rate>< userid>

<Text>Overpriced, hair cut not worth the 30 dollars , worst part , cash only but they do have an ATM inside if you need to get some cash , also you need to call for an appointment  , I found this other place where they also cut hair I think the shopping center is called the boulders and the business name is clippers  on Palm drive and took the rest of my family there. It's way cheaper better quality, excellent service at less than half the price (10 dollars) hair cuts are awesome at a more reasonable price, no appointment necessary.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>The owner is doing a soft opening as the shop is not due to open for another week or two but the shop looks great already. The barbers were welcoming, haircut was great, and the wait time was brief. I typically go to their Palm Springs location but I'll definitely come back to check this location out again.< /review><UserId.>117155732965456121511<//UserId.>< gmapID>

Downtown Barbers in Desert Hot Springs is a local barber which is right down my alley since I live here.  Matt cuts my husbands hair and is an artist of what he does.  Always walking out with a great cut and beard trim.  You rock Matt.  Thank you for your service.< /review>

Downtown Barbers is the best Barber Shop in DHS, and Martin Diaz is the best Barber at the shop by far. He is the most skilled and knowledgeable  Barber I've ever had the pleasure of cutting my hair. He will not let you leave the shop until you are 110% satisfied with his work. I highly recommend Downtown Barbers in DHS to everyone who appreciates great customer service and impeccable professionalism.</Text>

<review>I bought a Giants cap here recently as a souvenir for someone abroad. They had a large selection of hats including the original/authentic “on field” baseball cap styles and others. Anyway, I went back at 5:59 pm that same day to exchange it for a different size and the service was great, so I’m giving the T&B store 5 stars to say thanks for letting me in at closing time.<//review>< pics>

<text>I like that they have all the local high schools gear. Knowledgeable staff and always helpful. But not inexpensive. You get what you pay for.< /text>< rating>

<Text>You'll definitely find me shopping or browsing T&B. As much as I love this sports messiah of a place the prices are extremely frustrating. The cost of a non fitted hat there costed me about $30. It doesn't work for me and many others.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

T & B is one of the best sporting good stores in Marin County. They know most of the leagues and schools for each sport and can steer you towards making the right choice for whatever equipmant, clothing, shoes, etc you may need. They are some of the friendliest people around and are so helpful. We are so grateful they are so close and there for us!< /Text>

Why would you want to shop here? Seriously?

The prices are way too high, and the service frankly is erratic. Been inside a few times, and once had good service and advice, and every other time, either been ignored or frankly steered wrong.

Unless you need something this very instant, check out Amazon for anything off the shelf, or do a quick web search to find customized garment/equipment etc. alternatives.

I believe in shopping Local.... but this place doesn't deserve the business.<//review>

(Translated by Google) It is a good place ... to buy everything you need. If you practice Soccer, baseball or just to buy a sports accessory. (I liked the offers. Shhhh do not comment that they are good ..)

I’ve been going to this park since I was a kid. It always feels safe and clean. They provide dog poop bags and the play ground is nice. Only complaint is with the grass. There’s been times where they stop water and the grass all dies. Other times they way over water and it’s super muddy all the time. There are a few places that gather big mud water puddles during the rainy season or when they’re over watering. There are also lots of weeds in the grass with sharp stickers that have punctured my dogs paw and others that stick in their fur.< /review>

Nice park to play catch, soccer, or run around with the kids. Would be nice to have actual bathrooms though. I can never seem to get the courage to use the porta potty they have there.< /review>

I love this store!  Their native American jewelery is authentic and they have a huge selection.  In addition, there are many great unique gift items for just about any occasion.  The staff is helpful and prices are really good!  Take a nice walk around shoreline village and stop in this wonderful shop, you won't be disappointed.<//review>

<Gmap_id>0x80dd3124626a8261:0xa0e0701a322cf5c3< /Gmap_id><Review>This is Saturday June 8, 2019 and this has weighed on me since me, a 54 year old 30 year refinery company employee, my mom a 77 years young retired L.A. country social services supervisor, my bother a 56 year old owner of a large extermination company in the High Desert and his wife who is a successful realtor left this store. I give you all of our backgrounds because with all of that we were followed around this store by this unfriendly, rude and downright unwelcoming employee like common thieves. I don’t know what she has experienced in the past either at the shop or in life but whatever it was she is doing a great job of deterring business. I will tell all of my family, friends and coworkers of this experience and hopefully they will do the same to spread the word. As a homeowner and tax payer in the city of Long Beach this is a slap in the face and my only regret is  I didn’t get the employees name to post on this review for all to see.< /Review>< Resp>

A pleasant experience was had when I first entered this store.  The decor and color are the main attractions that brought me in, and without deception, I remained awhile browsing until I bought some Native jewelry that suited the needs of my collection.  This place is unique, and there is no other place like this in Long Beach!  How lucky we are!</Review>

I enjoyed my shopping experience and found several unique and precious items. The ladies there were professional and kind. I will go back when I visit Long Beach again. My husband and I have fond memories of our weekend shopping along the Shoreline Village.< /Text>

<text>I have not had lunch and decided to give this place a try because I did not want chipotle. I was disappointed to be honest. I ordered the fried chicken. It looks like it was cooked a few days ago and salad had a weird taste. The best part of the plate was only the rice and tortillas. I’ll give them another shot but will aim for the pizza next time.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3MhfopewvrSjS1yLdZzy7Ldb0xNtXD2t4sMgv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHSzi9IJpmETVo_AQimF5x1Q_Hy5pw0nXHedTa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXduGHLMH2O7K1Nb8484IhffIkuzf5fyHLylWg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I order from here often a very small place with good food and great staff.. Its not what you would expect if your thinking high quality dinning.. food quality is great though. Ome thing to remember is they DON'T TAKE CARD PAYMENT.. ONLY CASH!!!! Like i said before its a small spot.. Hardly any space for a lot of tables. Over all a great restaurant.</Text>< gmapID>

Restaurant options are limited in the area so this is a  good place for a quick bite. The menu has alot of variety and things to choose from. I got a fried chicken taquitos plate and it came with rice, beans, lettuce, avocado, cream and hot sauce. Tasty and satisfying, I was not disappointed at all. I originally went for the pizza but when I saw all the options I quickly changed my mind, I am glad I did too. Definitely going back to try the chili cheese burger soon. I didn't realize that it was Cash Only so keep that in mind; there is a convenience store next door with an ATM which I ended up using. Overall I enjoy this lunch spot.<//review>

Annoyed, been here 3 times before during lunch break. Hard to find parking, the wait is long, its ghetto inside, tables are always sticky, it's very cramped inside only 5 tables all 1 foot away from each other.

Last time I went, I bought $10 of food, lady forgot my green sauce. I got up to go get it, she was trying to charge me $0.50 for tiny cup. I always pay with card. But this place is cash only, I didn't have 50 cents. Fkn bs.</Text>

If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. Impeccable service, kindness, bedside manner and compassion for all patients. They take the time to understand each patient and their needs and most importantly, they are not satisfied until you are satisfied! That is the kind of dental practice everyone needs. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a dental provider. Thank you Doctor and staff!!<//Text></record>

I cannot say enough great things about Dr. Baker and every single person in the office.  A true team who work together to treat you in the best ways possible.  Dr. Baker is an extremely patient, understanding, caring person and is the ultimate professional.  Cutting edge techniques, super clean environment, no unnecessary treatments and  deep compassion towards each patient's needs, no matter how small or unique.  I wouldn't dream of going anywhere else and I'm very grateful to have found her.  Trust is huge and I trust Dr. Baker and the office every step of the way.  After coaxing me in from not seeing a dentist in 15 years due to past horrors, again, I'm so grateful every day I'm in her care.  Go and find out for yourself, you won't be disappointed.  My fears and issues have slowly melted away and I actually look forward to seeing them.  Can you say that about YOUR dentist? UPDATE: Just had second appointment with Dr. Anna. She's a great addition to CDS. Very thorough, communicative and great sense of humor. Just another great reason to go see Dr. Baker and her team. I always appreciate the professionalism and laser-focus on making sure their patients are getting the best treatment and direction for self-care. Thank you!</Text>

<Text>Dr. Baker always has the latest dental equipment in addition to being a true crafts-person.  When she does work on your teeth, you can barely tell there was work done because she does such a good job matching your natural teeth and making sure your bite is just right.</Text>< pictures>

Love the quality of everything that Guess sells. Sometimes the quality of apparel is discernable just by picking it up and holding it and that is definitely the case at Guess. In addition to quality apparel, the store is always very clean and tidy which makes shopping and finding what you’re looking for very easy< /text>

This is a great store.  I was lucky enough to have Matilda be my salesperson and she elevated the entire experience with her charming British accent and delightful attitude.  She was helpful and really knew her stuff.   I will most definitely be back.<//review>

Exactly what I expect from a pizza by the slice, price and taste-wise, but won't give 5 until I try it again for consistency.<//review>

The pizza and sides tasted great! I got the deluxe pizza and the garlic cheesy rolls. I really recommend the garlic cheesy rolls cause the cheese pulls were so satisfying and it was a good ratio of cheese, bread, and garlic. The wait time was a bit longer than estimated from ordering through yelp so make sure to call before you head over if you're picking up.</Text>

Good place for my lunch break. Cheese Pizza by the slice but if you add ingredients they heat it up again which creates a great crunchy crust!<//text>

Wanted to eat something at the airport that wasn't a burger. This was one of the few choices available. It is right near gate 18. The food was just ok.. We ordered the bbq chicken pizza for $18.18USD. It came out looking like aAmeci Pizza Kitchen . Not much sauce, meat or large at all. Normally, we can't finish an entire pizza. However, this pizza was sliced into 5 pieces and we were able to all of it. We also order the shishito peppers. It was tasty. However, a bit on the salty side. I was fairly disappointed. I don't think I will come back to this establishment again.</review>

<text>Great service and pretty good traditional pizza. They have a pizza with Flaming Hot Cheetos on it and it's pretty good if you're into Flaming Hot Cheetos but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it. Pretty gimmicky if you ask me. Wish their was a more intense pizza house around!🤘💀🤘</text><rating>3< /rating><userid>107499430519811573676<//userid>< Pictures>

< review>
Best pizza I've had in town, maybe even out of town. Reasonable prices, limited seating (maybe three tables), convenient parking.</review>

This is one of the best pizza stores I've ever been to! We ordered the New York style Pizza and it is very delicious. I high recommend  Ameci Pizza Kitchen for pizza lovers.< /text>

< Review>
Worst customer service!!!! I walked in to Foothill location to place an order and the salesperson was sooo not welcoming. He didn’t say hi, I was asking questions and he was not answering them or just saying “what?” with a blank face.  Seriously, I’ve never seen a salesperson with such an attitude in my life. How even they let a person like that deal with customers?! The pizza was great though. I was ordering through Postmates before and didn’t have to deal with their customer service before, but oh my God, that person ruined my day yesterday. I will never walk in there again!</Review>

< Review>
I was skeptical being that this is a new place. But after ordering pizza and wings I was pleasantly surprised at the quality, price  and flavor. The wings are man sized not the cheap tiny wings you get from the other chain places. I will definitely order from here again. *Update* this review was done when this place was not Ameci.<//Review>

We tried this place out for the first time tonight, WE ALL LOVED IT!   We intended to try the cracker crust but forgot to mention it, we got sent home with a lovely sample . It was fanatic,  will definitely be going back. The wings are baked too and yummy!    Ohhh and they have gluten free options too!</Text>

Excellent park and Recreation for neighborhood use. Perfect for parties, picnics, playgrounds or just chillin.  Two playgrounds, outside court, gazebos, lots of shade trees and passive turf areas plus plenty of parking. Staff in Recreation Center is absolutely amazing!!<//Review>

<Text>Great place to through a party. Lots of room and 2 kids areas.
FYI - I wouldn't advise making reservations on a certain spot.
Quite pricey. If your going to have a jumper the price almost doubles.< /Text><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

I would highly recommend this place! The young lady that helped us yesterday evening was the sweetest most friendliest person I have encountered at an ice cream shop. We purchased two single scoop ice cream. I chose the coconut flavor (which I had never had before) and it was delicious! They do provide samples if you needed to try a new flavor.</Text>

Best ice cream in Chico! The store was vintage and had a fun cute candy shop feel - the employees were enthusiastic and helpful and awesome - and the ice cream was tasty! I tried the Chico Mint and it was a fun twist on mint chocolate. Definitely would recommend!<//review>

<Review>It's Shubert's.  Long time family owned ice cream and candy shop.  If you have not been here you probably need your Chico credentials revoked.  Great ice cream, great candy, smells like literal heaven when you walk in.  This place is an institution.</Review><Time>1621639545447</Time>< rate>

Can someone say customer service!!..dang these emplees addressed is when we walked in. They were helpful in telling us about the different options in ice cream, and toppings. They were talking to the kids as well just a great experience.

Quality of product: the ice cream was good, I have to say I enjoyed the Mt Shasta ice cream it was chocolate with coconut and marshmallow. The decor was good, felt warm inviting.

Highly recommend Shubert's ice cream.</text>

This place is open late nearly every night! It helped me cure my late night craving for a fresh banana milkshake more than once. Candy is handmade and delicious, staff is invariably friendly and cute, and it is nice to support a locally owned multi generational business. Please give Shuberts your business so we can all continue to enjoy superior service, and keep the Walmarts of the world from becoming our only option.<//Text>

Shubert’s is aMAzing! My big sister used to take me for “Ice Cream Appreciation Class” at Shubert’s when I was a kid. Of course, anyone who has lived in Chico a while knows that Shubert’s has the best ice cream in town, but they also have the best handmade candies. So whether it’s Valentine’s Day or Ice Cream Appreciation Class, Shubert’s is the best!<//Review>

This is a great local ice cream and confectionary shop went there one evening and was treated to wonderful tastes and service. Be aware that the store lighting is set to be not super bright so at first glance I wasn’t sure the store was open but then I noticed the “open” sign.
Great place to eat ice cream<//text>

Chocolate mint and peppermint ice cream was Devine. Very kind staff too. Only drawback was there’s no public restrooms available and in this era that’s important! Lol .... Being from out of town they very kindly directed us onward.</Text>< pics>

Awesome ice cream texture, flavor. Excellent sundaes - rich thick whipped cream, succulent cherry. Plus- great 80s soundtrack. What's not to love!</Text>

Nice area to sit outside for few people. Friendly and helpful staff. Definitely recommend to anyone with kids, anyone passing through, or just for a perfect treat.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Homemade ice cream, and it is excellent! They also have fudge and seasonal specials (i.e.boysenberry sundae in the summer). Not too expensive either (paid $6.25 for double scoop banana split with 2 sauces).< /Text>< Rating>

Ice cream tasted like dirt. Probably because the store is dirty. Everything is covered in dust and grime here. Will not support this place ever again!!!!! Don’t go here if you don’t like the taste of DIRT!!!</text>

Old fashioned ice cream parlor with a slew of tempting options. I had a scoop of peach ice cream today and it was fabulous. The lemon custard scoop last week was equally good. Always wonderful service and a great candy counter round out a must visit every time there's a visit to Chico.</review>

Yummy!! Neat place. Staff friendly and helpful. And though we didn't purchase any, you can also buy homemade candy and other items. It was my son's Mom and Son day, and this was a perfect treat.</Text>

In a national contest to determine the best ice cream destination in the country, Shubert's came in second. They were robbed. Shubert's has been around for over 100 years, and Shubert's makes some of, if not the very best ice cream on the planet. Every item, even their chocolate dipped Oreos are fresh, delicious, and if you're lucky enough to catch the fresh boysenberry sundaes in season then you're going to have an experience rare to duplicate in this world. Shubert's also does candies and chocolates, and if you want to treat your mom, Dad, or sweet with a delicious box of sweets for Christmas, Easter or Valentine's Day, Shubert's should be your number one destination. Seriously, I can't recommend this place enough. Delicious!<//Text>

Best, and stop homemade every morning by the same family. Best candy, best ice cream, best location. During Thursday markets, and Saturday night can get crowded, but the service is always speedy. My first summer job.</text>

If you're from the area, you probably already love Shubert's. If you're new or passing through and like ice-cream this is the place to stop! Their flavors are of a solid selection and always some of the best I've ever had. it's honestly no shock they are a Chico classic.< /Text>

As a professional Candy Maker this place is a true Chico tradition with some of the Best Ice Cream ever. It reminds me of my grandfather he loved the lemon custard and every time I gets some I have great memories of eating ice cream out front with him. I also recommend their Candies. Thanks for making things the old fashioned way.</Text>

I went there on a bike ride with my friend to get her a Mt. Shasta shake. The line was quite long when I walked inside, but the employees did a great job of quickly helping everyone. The Mt. Shasta shake was delicious. We will definitely go here again in the future.</Review>

Excellent ice cream, my favorite is the seasonal peach, but my family LOVES the Mount Shasta flavor. Honestly, I've yet to encounter an ice cream here that isn't fantastic. The service is always good and friendly even with how crowded this place is all the time. There's frequently a line right out the door, so be prepared to wait a bit for your frozen treats, it's worth it. Their iced tea is great, but request easy ice, it's brimfull. Always worth a trip.<//Review>

The excellent locally made flavors and friendly service never changes here, even as Chico itself is growing at a dramatic pace! Also one of the best few places to get root beer ice cream, and their very own Chico Mint, which is chocolate ice cream with their house-made mint chips mixed in. :)< /Review>

<text>Great locally shop. Ice cream and candy made in house. Great ice cream texture and taste. This chocolate lover's all time favorite is lemon custard, and by the way the Mt. Shasta (chocolate,  coconut,  almonds) is pretty good.  In summer,  don't miss out on peach ice cream made from farmers market peaches!< /text>< Pictures>

The BEST ice cream in Chico! We had Shubert's Ice Cream at our wedding! We decided to mix it up and serve both cupcakes and ice cream to our guests. Though it was early November, and a bit on the cool side for weather, it was a great success! Our guests LOVED it! It was so fun and refreshing to have ice cream at our wedding! We had both the ice cream cart and a server to attend it. If you can afford this I highly suggest it. We didn't want a family member to have to worry about taking care of this for us or folks self-serving (especially with little ones running around). Have Shuberts at your wedding, you won't regret it!< /text>

Family owned and they have been a Chico gotta go to place for alit if us in Chico. I have never tried anything there that wasn't delicious and you could tell they take pride in offering only the best.
If you have a chance be sure to stop in for something sweet. You won't be sorry that's for sure.< /text>

. If everyone had to eat Shubert's even 1 time a week mandatory, the country would be in a lot better place. Tip these ladies they are always packed for good reason. Mint chip double sugar cone. Nuff said.< /review>

<Text>Totally disappointed with Shuberts. I went there and ordered an ice cream - Mocha Chip-and the first time was very good. I came back a month later and it was bland. I tried again in two months and bland again. I thought for sure that it must have been a mistake but I've tried it a couple more times and it always had light flavor. I am so bummed. I know the quality is good but the flavor was lacking. Yesterday I tried another chocolate, per the recommendation of the clerk there. It again was terribly bland. I hope they can step up their chocolate game...it is my favorite flavor, along with chocolate mint and mocha mint...but if it continues to be bland...I'll have to make ice cream at home or go to another place.  :(   I've only been here two years-but ice cream is my favorite food...Please change your chocolate recipes!!!!</Text></record></dataset><record>

Most famous for their Chico mint flavor, which is delicious! It's a really cute little shop, very typical of an old-fashioned ice cream/candy store, and it always smells heavenly when you walk in the door. The location is a little out of the way from downtown and with only street parking, but they've also got a spot at the Silver Dollar Fair now, for when that's in town. They also brew their own root beer.< /Review>

Not only do they serve the best ice cream in Chico but they have the most widespread variety of goodies (I don't really know how to describe it)  They are always so busy but somehow the whole staff manage to pull off great customer service. Sarah was in particularly helpful :) definitely coming back< /Review>

<Text>No better ice cream that I've ever had than Shubert's! I went tonight to get black licorice ice cream, but it had to ripen overnight. That's okay because there was lemon custard, pumpkin, root beer, etc. You just can't go wrong here!

Update: I did go back the next day for my licorice ice cream!!</Text>< username>

<text>The place to be at 8 on a Sunday night. It's a classic! Ice cream, candy, chocolate...what more could you ask for? They even had black licorice ice cream which my husband asked for assuming that there was no way they had it. Of course they did! Delicious ask the way around.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>If you go to Chico you have to go to Shubert's Ice cream. Not just the ice cream but the candy as well. I have to get my favorite mint and chip and candy to go when I'm in town visiting family. There ice cream is like homemade. Love it.< /Review>< Time>

My first visit enjoyed pistachio nut. Whole nuts, good flavor but not overly sweet. But I must say that Ben & Jerry's Pistachio is hands down the best, and Shuberts, while good, did not change that opinion.< /Review>< time>

Absolutely love Shubert's. Been going there since the late 70's and it has always been fantastic. Best ice cream I've had and staff is always so friendly! That's how they've stayed in business so long!<//text>

I love the Chico Mint, it is delicious! Fun and unique place to get ice cream that is well crafted. Perfect if you are staying at the Quality Inn since you are right across the street.< /Text>

You will go into a sugar high from the smells alone. The ice cream is delightful and refreshing during any time of the year. They have seasonal flavors that are worth trying.<//Review>

<review>Blackberry (similar berry) cream was amazing.
Google maps takes you to a parking area on 6th street. Candy store is next to parking but on 7th street. A little confusing for someone who is new to Chico. If you oark where Google maps puts you, you have to walk around the corner to get to the store. Coming back I jumped the low fence.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808327b6572b907b:0x5d5c459d3b696d58< /Gmap_id></record>

Good ice cream, but over priced. Usually when you visit a ice cream shop and you order a scoop of icecream, the scoops are huge, like close to one cup. At Shubert's the scoops are the smallest scoops I've ever seen anywhere. The scoop is probably about a fourth cup of ice cream, maybe a third cup.</Review>

< Review>
I went there with a purpose. My Pops and I shop in Chico, and for the 2 years he's been wanting to go to Schubert's after we finish shopping before we head up the hill toward Magalia. He likes the Maple Walnut  because hes from Massachusetts and he use to get that flavor growing up as a child a lot. He loved it. But  because we go to 2 different stores and usually have a lot of perushables, we tend to say "next time" and go home.

My Pops is 90, and was hospitalized at Enloe recently for 2 weeks. He wasn't eating very much, so I drove over to Shuberts, got him a quart and he ate half of it. He was thrilled.  Schubert's Maple Walnut was the last dessert he ate.  He died on Friday.  Thank you Shuberts for the Maple Walnut. You made a dying man's day. I just know he's up there bragging about it.</Review>
