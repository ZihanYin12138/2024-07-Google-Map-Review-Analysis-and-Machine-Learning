I meant to do this a while ago but I've been going here for some time now and it's been a great experience. I have never had any questions unanswered nor any problems that were not solved, they go out of their way to assist me explain things to me and I am forever grateful for their kindness & understanding. I truly feel like they all mean well & they love their job and they know what they're doing. If you ever need your car to sound amazing I would recommend going to them and they've got all kinds of options ..<//Review>

<review>I had them installed kenwood stereo system with backup camera in my 1999 Lexus ES 300. Excellent job and now I have nicely fitted LCD unit in my 20 years old car.

< Review>
HB AutoSound figured it out. The old-school art of having outstanding customer service, and then backing up your words with actions. Jason and his team made my visit a pleasure, and made me feel like I was a priority every time I walked through the door. I originally stopped in to price out a new sound system, I ended up making a purchase at Best Buy, thinking I was getting a good deal. Well what I really received, was an incompetent installation and a bunch of headaches. I walked back in to HB Auto Sound, slightly embarrassed, and asked Jason if he could help me fix all of the problems that occurred from my Best Buy installation. Summarizing this as best as I can, Jason and his team were cordial and eager to help. Even though I didn’t make my original purchase at the store, the team made me feel as though I was a VIP customer. In addition to the great customer service, Jason also gave me a great deal. Just can’t say enough about this place. As a follow-up, I was confused as to how some of the functions on my new Kenwood system worked, so I stopped by right before closing, and Jason came out, sat in the car, and gave me a tutorial. All I can say, is that if you ever plan on replacing the stereo in your vehicle, or you are having problems with your current system, this is the place you need to go. This is old-school customer service at its finest. #LOCALGUIDES #localguides< /Review>

Best place to get your car audio needs, I got a 12 inch Rockford P3 and 600 Rockford amp in my Lexus. All the ladies melt in my seat when the bass hits. Jason from HB made sure I get the best sound for my car since I haven’t got a system installed in years, tech has changed since 2010 and Jason educated me on the new technology and provided the best customer service. I feel like I made a new family with HB Sound will always come back. Thank you guys<//review>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Went here for the first time and gave me a quote for a jbl subwoofer (jbl basspro hub 11”) that fits on my spare tire. I agreed to it and trusted them. When I got back a different sub woofer (jbl basspro sl 8”) was installed and charged me with the same amount of subwoofer (jbl basspro hub 11”) that was showed to me. After I went home googled the price of the subwoofer that was installed and found out that the subwoofer that was installed was just half the price of the amount charged to me. Called them back and the guy was giving excuses why I was charged the price that was shown. I Would not recommend this place to my friends.<//Review>< Pics>

My car looks so sexy now!!!!!! I got my tint done  here because they have the best prices around and also LIFE TIME WARRANTY!!!??? Way too good to pass up. They were all super nice and took their time answering my questions. AND they were quick, especially for being as busy as they were that day. I think my car was only there for a few hours !!! 10/10 would reccomend to everyone!< /review>

<review>First time we went in to fix our radio, ended taking 6 hours, and then they said they needed another part, so we back a few days later, then they fixed the radio but we have a movie player and they didn’t have the part for the connection so we have to come back again. Ended up being $800 which I will say is pretty cheap but we had to sit there for more than 10 hours in total and we still have to go in again
The guys in the office were nice but, there wasn't very good communication.
Would recommend if you need it fast.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dd26f604d21853:0xcbdefe0ae4bacaf5<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Called a few shops to get prices, everyone quoted me $200.00+ for an Interface adapter and most didn't have it in stock. Called HB Autosound, said he has exactly what I need and when I arrived the price was only 80$ for the adapter + Extras. Honest prices, with great customer service and staff. Thank you HB AutuSound!!< /text>

These guys are ripoffs and their customer service is a joke.

8 months ago they installed a head unit and back up cam on my truck (worked with Jason and had a good experience).  The back up camera broke a few weeks ago.  I recently moved out of town (about 1.5 hours away from HB AutoSound) so I called to explain that it would be a long drive for me and I wanted to make sure they had time to fix the back up cam and also put in new speakers and tint the windows so I could make it back before traffic hour around 2PM.
Decided on Tues and I got in the shop about 10AM.  As I dropped off the truck they let me know the tinter wouldn't be in until 5PM.  Was a little annoyed that I called ahead several days and told them what I wanted and then they didn't schedule the tint guy.  But I know it's a contracted service and they don't have full control over the contractors schedules, so all good.  They said the truck would be done by 2PM and I said I'd be back between 2 and 3.  I got back to the shop at about 2:45 and the sales guy told me they hadn't touched my truck yet...  Didn't apologize, just said they got busy and hadn't had time to work on it yet.  I told him I called ahead days in advance to make sure they had time to do this and then confirmed the time again when I dropped it off and asked when it would be done.
Then get this.... he says his tech was out at lunch but once he gets back it should be done in about 1.5 hours.... What a joke.  I told him that was ridiculous and not to do the speakers and just fix the back up cam as soon as he could so I could get out of there.  About 45 mins later he comes back and says that the back up camera was broken and even though it was under warranty, I shouldn't expect the manufacture to honor the warranty because they had bad customer service.....  I told him they should take care of it since they chose to sell the companies products.  He said that they wouldn't.  AND HERE'S THE KICKER.  Then he says, hold on, and looks on his computer for a min and tells me that I should buy another back up camera from them and pay to have them install it........  He says he can give me a discount on labor and only charge me $60 for labor and that he has no flexibility on the price of the camera which was $85.  Guess what bruh, the internet exists.  I looked up the exact camera he tried to sell me and it's $39.99 on Amazon brand new.

These guys are clowns.  The prices on some things seem good but it will cost you twice as much in the long run.  Go somewhere that respects their customers.< /review>

New to the area, and love supporting local businesses. Dave at HB Auto Sound hooked me up with a great new stereo with hands free and nav to help me get around my new foreign hometown legally! Prices were reasonable and installation was quick and expertly preformed. Good selection and great advice. I got exactly what I needed quickly at a great price. I highly recommend you go see Dave for all you car audio and security needs!< /text>

First day I went to this shop, Kevin heard the sound coming from my system and within seconds, knew what I needed. He gave me a few options and told him I would come back. 2 weeks later, I went back, told him what I wanted to do, setup an appointment, and decided to get an audio controller installed since I wanted to keep the stock stereo. The sound quality is great! The shop re-wired some cables for me since the previous shop didn't know what they were doing. I highly recommend this shop!!< /Text>

<review>Bought an alarm for $89.00. The guy there told me he was giving me a good deal since the original price is $129. After purchasing it I found out that the same model is being sold between $30-$40 at other places. They don't allow returns so I'm at a lost now. Never going back again.</review>< pics>

False advertising on their website and when you get there they add charges that are not disclose on website deals aren't really deals When you ask for it they tell you we don't have it or offer it but you bay buy something else which ends up costing hundreds more than what you went for. Deceptive place don't waist your time and save your gas.</Text>

Very friendly staff. The outcome was incredible. My teeth looks amazing. I love the attention they give me. Since the first day I walked in I felt very welcoming. Dr. Igor is an artist. I would definitely recommend this office to see Dr. Igor's gallery. Thank you Gardena Dental Care. I'll  be definitely coming back.< /Review>

I had my deep cleaning done today and I was really pleased with Dr Z, my teeth feels clean. The price that I paid for my deep cleaning it's really worth it and affordable price. Office is so clean and staff are very friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend Gardena Dental Care to my family and friends.</Review>

I always look forward to my appointments here at Gardena Dental Care. The orthodontist here (Mr.Ortiz) is the best! He always has a positive attitude and just brightens up your visit! Mr.Ortiz did such a phenomenal job with my orthodontic treatment, my teeth look so astonishing every time I smile. The staff is also very welcoming especially David such an amazing staff member,  he knows how to engage well with you and made me feel welcomed while getting my treatment done. Overall I recommend Gardena Dental Care for anyone looking to seek orthodontic treatment. Thank you so much Gardena Dental Care! :)</review>

I will like to share my Experience at Gardena Dental Care. I found this location on Yelp and chose to make a visit based on the good reviews it had. I went with confidence for a consultation to see what they can do for my teeth. They recommended I removed my whole upper arch and replace it with implants. I agreed to have this done by Dr. Omid for me with confidence everything was going to turn out just how I wanted it to be. Fast forwarding to the completed job It turned out to be the worst decision I could have made for myself. I am suffering, they did a horrible job and yet gave me no hope to even bring me back to how I was. I cannot eat with my new implants, something I was capable of doing before with my bad teeth. My implants are horribly attached to my upper gum and it is just an awful pain I face, worse of it all is they have no hope to help me fix the nightmare I am facing today. please don’t make the same mistake I made and see my pictures below of Dr. Omid’s work; this will show more of my descriptive pain I face. keep in mind they charged me $19,000 dollars to just dismiss me and leave me looking like this and despite the looks I can’t eat. I’m an elderly lady with diabetes, eating is very important for my health. please don’t make the same mistake I made! Please know this will also be reported to the America Dental Association / Dental Board and taking legal actions.< /Text>

<review>Everytime I came to this office the Front office are extremely rude and I'm very unhappy with their service, I've paid this dentist over 10 thousand dollars all cash 💸 for all of my 3 children dental work ( thinking they would actually do a better job) and they constantly behave extremely bad and unnecessary to be that way despite the Pandemic. 2 of my children had Ortho work done here and I paid them over 4,000 dollars for each of them that's more than 8,000 dollars for both jobs on side of other dental work that they've done, it has been like other 2,000 or so. I know they probably have a better pricing or maybe not but their rudeness and unfairly treatment I received is outrageous 😳. My other child will be needing braces, well I'm not giving them my business thanks to their poor costumer service. I'm just waiting for my daughter to finished up her braces here because I've paid for them already and that's it.

I actually recommended them to a friend of mine to te office on El Segundo and O regret it so much.<//review></record>

I had an amazing experience at Gardena Dental Care. Their follow up was excellent and I felt extremely taken care of. Dr. Nima was extremely nice and explained everything he was doing. I had 2 dental implants placed. The office staff was very friendly and the office was very clean and sanitary. I have nothing but great things to say about Gardena Dental Care.</Text>

Great staff! I love coming here!! I've been coming here for 2 years in counting. So welcoming and very honest with treatment. All of the dental assistants are really nice and helpful especially Enrique. He is so nice and he changed my color for my braces from purple to black with no complaints! He’s a great 👍🏾</Review>

This place is the worst, starting with the front desk if you don't have any medical insurance they treated you like a nobody, the Doctor even more worst doesn't take his time to checking your mount to see what is the problem,he only check if your have a good insurance .</review>

Piece of my molar fell out today, I'm so grateful they open and were able to help me. Everyone was so nice and took all the precautions (during this time). This is a great dentistry and would definitely recommend to anyone for emergency or non emergency dental visits.<//text>

I visited this office on 8/18/2020  for pain that I was feeling in my gums... They were trying to charge me 7 K worth of work. So I decided to go get a second opinion and my medlife PPO insurance covered it all... This dentistry is  just in it for the money and not for your well being... They told me I needed two rout Canals and to extract my wisdom teeth... I'm really glad I went to go ask for a second opinion and I am Pain Free now..... If I can say anything about this dentistry is to stop exploiting people for the money they have and you can cause someone a lot of pain and damage for work they don't even need... That's False Practice... I advice everyone to get a second opinion before you actually go thru it....< /Review>

I started having pain yesterday at work and I didn’t think much of it.  The next morning I was in more pain I could not take it. I found Gardena Dental Care and decided to give them a call. The receptionist was very nice and gave me helpful information about the consultation. She was able to accommodate me within minutes. I was so comfortable at the office the staff made me feel great. I was so nervous but the doctor explained very thing to me. I got treatment the same day and had a great experience with the doctor. I can say my fear for the dentist is gone yay!!!<//Text>

I have been looking for a dentist who will replace a crown with a crown type covered by my insurance. This office tried to sell me some exotic material not covered by the insurance.  Just trying to pad their profit margin IMHO. I'm 73 years old even the least expensive Crown would probably outlive me. If you're looking for honest reputable Dentist, I would not go here.<//Review>

<review>Wow! Talk about excellent service!! I was recommended to this dental office by a family member and let me just say my experience was amazing! Once you walk in your greeted with a sincere welcome and happy smiles. Everyone at the front desk is really friendly and helpful with every and any questions you may have. As it was my first time back into a dental office in over 6 years I had many questions and concerns they quickly put my mind at ease and gave me all the information I needed. If your looking for excellent service and an amazing environment I would highly recommend you give this office a chance to give you a Happy Brighter smile back into your life. I know I will!!< /review>< resp>

I really can’t believe how awesome every member of this team is ! They are all so friendly, knowledgeable and extremely efficient with super communication booking, confirming with reminder call, texts and emails !!! But the best part is how Dr. Matsui is dedicated to implementing the latest technology and procedures flawlessly. There is nothing archaic about this office, which eases my anxiety coming to get my treatment done and leaves me feeling Great about my care !!!!!< /Review>

Worst experience I've ever encountered with a dentist!!. My son needed work and we called ahead of time and informed them we needed a specialist and they assured us they would be able to provide us with the services by phone. Get there and as my sons getting his xrays the Dentist rudely attempts to kick me out the area without any type of professional greeting. I understand parents make their kids weak, no biggy, but the attitude I got from the dentist when trying to comfort my son is lack of manners from someone I'm taking my services too. Furthermore they took the xrays and the dentist didnt want to do the work because guest what, he needs a specialist, as I told them from the start. Starting to wonder if it was borderline discrimination or hes just that grumpy while his staff makes excuses for him. Be aware if your dealing with them!</Text>

Gardena Dental Care Is Amazing!!!!! Dr. Neda performed a root canal, extraction, and implant on me today. I have no pain at all! I am looking forward to the rest of my treatments for my teeth. Danny is the best X-Ray Tech Ever!!!! They constantly asked if I was okay and they even gave me a small pound cake dessert in between the root canal and extraction. Gardena Dental Care has eliminated the fear I had of the dentist. I can actually say I really enjoyed my visit to the dentist!!!! Thank you Cassandra for working out my plan and dental schedule!💜💜💜💜💜See you in 2 weeks Dr. Neda!!!😁😊💜💜💜💜💜💜💜<//Text>

I’ve been coming here for many years now. The staff is very friendly and always smiling. The hygienist Rhonda is amazing she always makes me feel comfortable and does a great job. They always work with my schedule, sometimes even get me in last minute which I truly appreciate. The whole environment is just overall welcoming, definitely makes the whole dentist experience a lot less scarier lol. Oh and their consultant Jessica is awesome as well. I had a consultation for braces and she took her time to explain to me step by step why I had some of the dental issues and why it was so important to stay on top of my visits. She was very knowledgeable and nice. I bring my little ones here too, we all enjoy our visits! Thank you Gardena Dental :)</Text>

<Text>Went in for teeth cleaning.

They said had multiple cavities and estimated charges of 2k. They said they could also finance the amount no problem.

Got a second and third opinion. Both said I had no cavities!

Customers beware of these fraud practices.< /Text>< rate>

<review>This review is mainly about price. I came here because my regular dentist didnt have any appointments open. First off the staff and office people were very friendly.  I called the day before to get a crown reattached.  They gave me an estimate around  $200 to $300 if reattaching the crown was possible.  My dental insurance is fully used until next year so I would be spending cash. I got to the office on time and they saw me soon. I showed the dental assistant my crown and within about 30 seconds she said it wouldn't work and I would need a new crown. Then the dentist did quick exam and said the same. The office manager quoted me $2,125.00 for the procedure,  new crown and some minor surgery on my gums to make the crown fit. On the plus side they offer payment plans but the last thing I need is another bill. I can't afford that right now so I left and went price shopping to get a new crown. My regular dentist had a cancellation and I was seen 30 minutes after. My regular dentist worked on my original crown for 30 to 40 minutes,  fitting it and then making sure after it was reattached I could floss and my bite was correct and they charged me $65. My regular dentist saved me on this one.
Just a side note on pricing.  Modern Dental on Hawthorne in Torrance did a root canal and crown for $1800.
It's been a few years but I got another root canal and crown from Western Dental for  $1500.
This year I got a full dental implant for $1500 ($1500 from insurance and $1500 that I paid) From Rainbow Dental on Sepulveda Blvd in Torrance, California.
So far as I can tell Rainbow Dental is the best in the area. Rainbow does good work and worked with me once on payments for a cash transaction.
If you are paying Cash I would recommend a different dentist than Gardena Dental< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Name>Ted Twyman<//Name>< gmapID>

This was by far the best dental visit I've ever had. Office manager Miss Emily Garcia was excellent. I will be back for all future visits. I recommend this office to any and everyone.</review>

<Review>Awesome staff and very skilled drs along with the dental assistants, they guide you through every step and they're even open on Saturdays for those of us that work Monday through Friday or get off late they will accommodate depending on your schedule.  Definitely recommended this dental office to all my family and friends!</Review>< date>

If only I was able to give more than 5 stars.

Very nice and clean place.  Everyone is very nice and very helpful since I first started coming here.  I've always been a little self-conscious about being in clean places, especially if I was going to go to a dental office; but once I walked in, I felt very comfortable because of how clean everything was.

Then came the Dr., and he made me feel totally comfortable.  I usually always go to the dentist once I get the letter in the mail; and the next thing you know Dr. B made me feel like family every time I walked in.  He's very professional, does a great job and was exactly what I was looking for when going to see my Dr. for routine checkups and cleaning.  Great Dr., great staff, and couldn't ask for anything more.< /Text>

I asked for a price over the phone (no insurance) for a tooth removal because the tooth was loose and painful. They said it depends... Seemed like it should have been an easy answer but they wanted me to get checked in the office.  Got in got it checked 3 hours of waiting and 600 dollars later I got it removed. I was in real pain so i had to really get it out that day and since it was already 6 pm i had not much choice.  So how it is that I asked some people that they had their tooth removed for less than 300 and I got 600? Not cool.< /text>

If I can give them 0 star I would. They only care about how much money they'll make of you not how to make you feel better. I think most of the 5 stars reviews here are FAKE.< /Text>

<text>I had an AMAZING experience here.When u first walk in everyone is on it with the smiles and morning greetings.  Danny took my x-ray's (which I've had HORRIBLE experiences in the past) and made me feel super comfortable and he didn't hurt me while doin so. He was funny which really made me feel better.The hygienist and dentist were both really nice explained everything and didn't make you feel rushed at all. The doctor that runs the establishment is sweet, organized and very helpful and she really worked with me in regards to the procedures I had to have done. I really only have GREAT things to say and that's really saying a lot from me considering that I do kind of have a slight fear of the dentist......well at least I use to!😁< /text><gmapID>0x80c2b581edd159c9:0xf86af73551aaed4c< /gmapID>< pics>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>Very expensive place, and be very careful with billing they will charge you again for something you have already paid them. Any cavities that just need to be fixed they tell you that you will need a root canal just  to charge you more money with no regard for what they do to your teeth. They have doctors that don’t know what they are doing, If you do go here for dental services make sure that they don’t force a doctor on you, choose the doctor you want not what they stick you with. I chose this dental office for the reviews but the reviews don’t reflect the dental office. At least at the time I was looking for a dentist. Now I see more bad reviews as of posting my review almost a year ago.</text></record></dataset><record>

I walked in for the first time and after taking X-ray, This Asian man came in to the exam room and without introducing himself he started checking my teeth, I seriously didn’t know if he’s the dentist or not. He started checking my teeth to the point that it was bleeding and he just left the room and told me that they’ll talk to me about the payment and finance. My mouth was full of blood and I had to get up from the chair to get some mouth wash myself. Then they try to get me to do an implant for $4600, What’s wrong with these people. The only reason I went to this office was because the reviews on Google but it’s fake reviews, the people who gave them 5 stars never went to that office. This office is old, dated and the dentist is rude and unprofessional.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Emily got me right in and made sure I didn’t wait and I had the most painless X-rays with Danny! My new hygienist Paula cleaned my teeth so well I feel like a new man! Most times leaving a dentist I always have to google something or try to figure out what they were talking about but Dr. Yun left me with no questions. Explained everything thoroughly and I just wanted to share my experience with everyone. You gotta check this office out, best one stop shop around...... Update:! I just wanted to post a review on my progress here at Gardena dental care, I am extremely happy with the results and service I’m getting here so far, I am always looking forward for my next visit, great staff and family atmosphere 👍🏽👍🏽< /text>< gmap_id>

The energy in this place is amazing! It kind of actually has you look forward to going to the Dentist...fast forward 2 months later and 6 teeth less I still feel the same way! Gloria has taken care of me with my insurance and dental costs, Dr. Neda made sure I felt no pain and my healing process was great during my extractions CJ did an awesome job helping, and my new orthodontist Dr. Hamid Bark has got me laced with braces and set to a beautiful smile 😁.

Gardena Dental Care goes the extra mile to make sure their patients are well cared for. I had been postponing treatment for a root canal for months until I just couldn't take it anymore. It was early in the morning when I called and I was expecting to be scheduled with the dentist later in the week. I was surprised that they made my appointment a priority and had me in before noon the same day. I became more of a fan of this dentist when he informed me that I didn't need a root canal like my previous dental office tried to get me to pay for. All I needed was a moderate sized filling. I feel I've saved a lot of time and money working with this honest and affordable dental practice.<//text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>This dental office has horrible management! The office Mgr. Emily is very rude. I called her to address some concerns we had regarding a negative experience my wife had on her 1st visit to this office. My wife came in for a general evaluation and cleaning. The office performed additional dental work that was not disclosed, was not planned, and was not covered by the insurance Co almost $920.00? My wife did not sign for these services or did not sign the office proposed treatment plan form, until after the fact and while she was still sedated? They also proposed additional work/treatments (braces) at a price of $4,999? They even had my wife sign an application for a loan so that a third party finance Co./shark would finance all of these charges. Of course, she immediately was approved for up to $7K.  Of course the office was very happy, for the cross-sale they were going to do.

Emily’s response to our concerns were; well the work was done, your wife singed for it and it is what it is and do as you please??

She didn’t even care, clearly this office doesn’t care about their patients. The only thing it really matters to them is to cross- sale whatever they can.

Beware, please ask for up-front disclosure of all charges. This office is unethical and out of line!!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

My gums had overgrown my braces and it looked really bad. They offered a surgical procedure. I was a bit skeptical at first, but now that the oral surgery is complete, I couldn't be happier.<//text>

< review>
My dentist her name is WENDY she is AWESOME and i grantee you she is better then your dentist lol (no point intended) she was really professional and very sweet, she was very out going and had great attitude not to mentioned she knows what she is talking about she been doing this for 7 years and she does suggest ideas and her game plan to you before she excutes it to perfection. Plus a Nice warming and welcoming staff everybody was nice and professional I will be back to get the rest of my dentist work done by her. Dr. Singh should be proud of this woman! She the real MVP.< /review>

I went to Dr. Omid's Gardena location for a couple of implants that I've needed for a while now. Like his carson location, the staff was very welcoming and professional. This office looked like it belonged in Beverly hills but the price he charged me was super cheap. Like last time, I experienced no pain and no discomfort. Best dentist I've ever had!< /text>

Best Dentist In Gardena. great doctor gentle touch and affordable prices. clean modern  office and friendly staff.  I am very scared of dentists. I went to Gardena Dental Care after my back tooth was hurting me. I bit down on some pizza and my tooth broke.  it hurt all the time. I couldn't sleep and no matter how much Tylenol Advil or anything else I took the pain would not go away.   Specially when i drank cold or hot water or ate food. I went into The doctor he removed the tooth for me and i didnt feel a thing. the same day he put in a dental implant and i was on my way. i didnt have any pain during or after and i was so scared about the dental implant .he took the tooth out and put the implant in and it took less than an  hour. i recommend gardena dental care to everyone best dental office</text>

<review>To all of you who read this. I've been doing business as a dental technician with Dr.  Omid, for about 5 years now. Over the last 15 years i have been working with lots of dentists as  a business owner. Now you have to ask yourself. Why did i ask my mother that lives in Toronto , Canada to come over here in California and have 7 implants placed by Dr. Omid. I could have sent her to many other dentists. There is only one reason. Besides having a very gentle hand , Dr. Omid has a talent at placing implants, restoring them, doing root  canals and other related services.< /review>< gmap_id>

<review>This dental office is horrible management don’t even care about what they insurance covered the only thing it really matters to them is to upsell whatever they can  if you deny the upsell they don’t even want to do the work that  it’s covered under insurance  as a matter fact they don’t even want to give you an appointment for next 6 months  unless you spent some money on dental work that it’s not covered under insurance<//review>< Pics>

He is honest and tells you how it is. he doesnt judge just wants to fix the problem and send me back to lliving my life. easy to get in and out. always on time. I had some work done by him previously and he is very gentle. only dentist i can say absolutely no pain. The office sees children of all ages does braces dental implants, crowns root canals wisdom extractions.  the office even calls before and after my appointment to see how I was doing.  who does that ??? In a time where everyone is trying to do less its nice to find an office that goes the extra mile. they are affordable have payment plans and always work with me to get what i need.

Great experience, for my daughter. They cut it the way she wanted it. The place looks like it might need some remodeling but service was great.<//review>

<review>We've come here for years. I appreciate the attention to detail and thoroughness of the cut and style. I also appreciate the patience shown to my son, who is on the spectrum, when it comes to showing him the "tools" being used on him.   That said, this morning, there wasn't change in the register, so it was either leave a $4.00 tip or use the charge card and pay an extra dollar for that! Not good...didn't appreciate it!</review><rate>4</rate>< gmap_id>

Also what do you have to say about lupita taking her minors to work and having her eldest vacuum the chair ?! He is s child there is a difference vacuuming at home and vacuuming at the moms work place ....

Antonia has been cutting my toddlers hair since he’s been 1 ....your stylist made a scene at my toddler for the lil figures!

Looks like loyalty is not a priority to you since I didn’t give you a 5 star rating which you can blame your stylist Lupita for going at my toddler ....you got your money for which I also over paid for.

With that being said she should have enough money to pay for a babysitter so she doesn’t take her kids to work and have them help her .</Text><gmap_id>0x80c2ce296f837ebf:0xb9d81fa6170df560</gmap_id><Name>Maria C Sosa<//Name><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

The first time i went it was great the lady toke a picture he got his first haircut got a toy i was happy. But i went yesterday for Labor day and i told the lady i wanted a trim and to add some layers because i wanted his hair to look thick she gave me a look like if i was stupid. She said theirs no such thing as layers i was like what i tried to explain to her how i wanted it and she was still arguing with me. I was not in the mood to argue because i was in the hospital in the night , le valio madre and she cut his hair totally diffrent then how i told her and it was short. Not worth going again for $19 with a lady that doesnt listen to what the customer wants. It was unbelievable.<//text>

I understand that they have to have rules, but I made my appointment at 1 and I arrived 20 min late and the lady no longer wanted to attend me and attended me in a very bad way. I was talking to her and she was going to be a little late and I Worse, I was not attending to anyone .. I had always come here but honestly it is not cheap at all what they charge to treat people as if they were giving away their work .. Nimodo I will have to find another place

<Review>(Translated by Google) They charge as expensive as if they offered the best service when it is the opposite ... my child from the beginning did not like sitting in a cart full of hair and the stylist never tried to convince him I had to hold it and finish full of hairs of my bb That he had such a bad cut that it seemed that instead of taking him with the "experts" he would have cut his 7-year-old brother.

(Original)
Cobran tan caro como si ofrecieran el mejor servicio cuando es todo lo contrario...mi niño desde el principio no le agrado sentarse en ningun carrito lleno de pelos y la estilista nunco trato de convenserlo tuve q sostenerlo y terminar llena de pelitos de mi bb q quedo con un corte tan mal q pareciera que en lugar de haberlo llevado con los según "expertos"lo hubiese cortado su hermanito de 7 años.😈</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Pretty good experience overall. Took one star off for times where are too many substitutions for my order. Walmart employees are awesome and am grateful that they show up and do their jobs well.<//Review>

Plus the girl named Elizabeth that was helping us out was extremely rude and ignored other customers that were already here. We had to knock on the door repeatedly just to get someone's attention. To help us and the girls answer to it was everyone knows what to do and I dont need to ask ummm excuse you have a job and you need to attend to the customers that need help I will be contacting corporate for this issue and whats sad is im not the only customer complaining...:( never again .... If i could put no stars i would<//Review>

Horrible experience. We placed our order 2 days ago and selected today as our pickup date. We received the email stating our order was ready for pick up. Arrived and parked. Turns out that they were running behind almost an hour. We waited almost 2 hours before we left with no groceries. There was no communication from Walmart staff giving us any updates or any reason for the really long delay. There others that had been waiting longer. Extremely disappointed.<//Text>

Very very poor service at grocery pick up. Their "associates" are rude to customers, the so called "coaches" are even worse. One would think the coaches would be an improvement over their associates who they are supposed to supervise. I would not suggest this store to anyone. Walmart should retrain their entire staff and terminate any who cannot understand that customer service is very important or you get no business.< /text>

I arrived at 10:47am and my departure time was around 12:15pm. There was only one Wal-Mart team member bringing out  purchased goods to about 14 cars.
Also I expected to receive substitutes for some items I purchased because I was notified that the store was out of the exact Items I selected but that was not the case. The team member told me the items was not available in store and I should be receiving a refund. I decided to go in the store just to see if the items was in stock and of course majority of the items was in store. I normally go in and select my own items to purchase but I decided to do order pick up for social distancing purposes and this was not a great experience. Now the team member that brought my items to the car was very nice and helpful.</Review>< Resp>

The pickup employees are so polite and considerate!!!! Very good customer service. The Downey Apollo walmart on the other hand is wayyyyyy too big to not have everything instock. Whoever does the ordering should be fired. I dont see why all of the walmarts don't have the order to pickup service for the groceries. If they did I wouldn't even go to Apollo Walmart.</review>

<Review>Dimly lit pick-up area. Associates now call out your name which is a bit off putting because there are others waiting for her or his order. Make sure to double-check items being picked up. Got home & found my waste bin lid was broken, loaves of bread squished beyond repair, & a whole half ham missing from my order. I know due to COVID-19 we are to stay in our vehicles but you may want to make the effort & put your own groceries in your car while checking your ordered items - saves the need of having to call Walmart later for an exchange/refund. 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c2cdb7d377f4c9:0xf347b669ee3a05c1<//gmap_id><rating>3<//rating></record></dataset><record>

Had my first horrible experience at this Walmart store# 04133 at the pick up. The pickup was delayed a day.  Then a email was sent at 5:30am today and we went to the pick at noon and waited an hour saw many cars waiting to find out from an employee to ask, orders from yesterday were canceled.</Review>

<text>This is a difficult review to put to paper. I ordered a Blackbird, paid for it, and took delivery 9 months later. The delays were out of the control of Bolton Ebikes. I understand that. The bike quality is very (very) high, and the price is amazing for the quality received. However... customer service is unsatisfactory for a modern company. They have a policy of scheduled phone calls only. It was a week away to the first available call-slot when I had difficulty assembling my new bike. Their primary way to communicate is via email. This meant that when I ran into a problem putting my bike together, I had to stop, write an email and wait (until the next day). Their answer was helpful, but did NOT fix the problem.
When you prepay for a $2,500.00 bike and wait months for it to arrive, you should expect a more timely response to customer communications. I am sure Kyle has a host of reasons why they do not have phone based customer service, but from the customer point-of-view, his reasons do not matter. It is not just an irritant to the customer, but a deal killer to any further ebike orders from THIS customer.</text>< gmap_id>

<Text>I've bought a few things from Bolton Ebikes now. Brakes, Rad Rover upgrade kit, and better motor. Totally woke up my bike and made it 10x more fun. Great value (even with the exchange rate and shipping to Canada). Also, their support is fantastic. Needed a bit of help and they were right on it. Thanks guys.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Received used/damaged item & poor Customer Service:
Ordered the RadRover upgrade controller from Bolton Ebikes on June 3rd with a given backorder July fulfillment time. I just received the controller on August 24th. First disappointment. Opened the box to discover I received what looks to be a used controller and LCD screen as the screens film had been reapplied and the mounting bracket for the controller was bent; looked to have been ripped off. I immediately proceeded to take pictures of this damage, then emailed Bolton regarding these concerns. It's been nearly a week now with no response. We have emailed all the contacts made available yet no response.

Follow-up to Bolton's response:
I can confirm Bolton received our email regarding our concerns. As an IT company, we utilize an appliance that intercepts, records,  and monitors ALL email communications sent and received. I just once again verified there is no email traffic incoming from Bolton since the Bolton auto responder email on Monday; confirming you had received ours.

Additionally, the shipping box was not damaged in the least so leaves the possibility of repackaging by the carrier. Please locate our emails and reply. I'm confident there is simply a communication problem but from our vantage point, it's not on our end. Thank you for any assistance you can provide and will update this review once we have a mutually fair outcome.

Lastly,  as a customer, I'm confident a phone number was included at time of order At this point, a call would be appreciated. The name for the order is the same. As a business owner myself, something I would have immediately pursued post a negative review of any kind. Thank you, Shawn

9/18/2020 Update. Nearly a month now and still no response.  Considering the lack of response, I proceeded to install the controller -- IT DOES NOT WORK! I was able to power on the unit and found all the default setting had been modified so it indeed had been used at least once before.  Guess I'm forced to contact the BBB next, then go from there.< /Text></record>

Kyle took time from his day to educate my wife and myself about e bikes. After his instruction we decided to purchase two of the Bolton Blackbirds even though they aren't scheduled for delivery until September. This after much research on my part, Kyle made things much clearer. So I know I've purchased the best e bike in my price range.  Thank you Bolton  E Bikes</review>

I ordered the wrong size bike from Bolton , it was a Sunday when I sent a frantic email to Bolton customer service rep Jessica and to my amazement she responded that day saying she had changed the order to the correct size. This was my first purchase with Bolton and won’t be the last. Thank you Jessica.</Text>

<Review>Not impressed with this company. I ordered a RADPOWER UPGRADE KIT -
They delivered it 2 months late. And it does not fit my Rad Runner as promised.  So installing it will be very difficult!  Need to be an engineer! And no bike shops can help either. So I ended up with a $300 White Elephant.  Not happy with Bolton.< /Review><rating>1<//rating><gmapID>0x809b70df450411c7:0x6287dce72ac9e88d<//gmapID>< userid>

<Text>Kyle is knowledgeable. He knows a lot of stuff about ebikes. His prices are fair. I test drove Foxbat, 20inch folding, new blackbird. New blackbird is very powerful with a torque sensor. Foxbat is also good. Great quality ebikes from a very professional owner. Don’t forget to watch his YouTube videos. Fantastic experience overall.< /Text>< Pictures>

I can't find a phone number anywhere or an email address.  This seems the only way to contact you.  Are you still in business?  My email is whitehead361@gmail.com.  Please contact me about your Foxbat bike.  I'm getting nervous about your customer service and viability. Thanks.< /Text>

<Review>Kyle's YouTube videos brought me to BOLTON EBIKES.  I'm 71 years old and wanted Transportation that I could hang on a rack behind my Jeep or motor home. I drove to their shop and test drove one of the FoxBat 1,000 watt models. Kyle and the guys were extremely helpful and informative. I bought the E-bike and several options to make the bike comfortable for me. The components used are much better than E-bikes costing much more. I'll post again once I know how the service is. Michael

Okay, I said I'd do a follow-up once I  knew more about Bolton Ebikes from a service perspective. I had the Foxbat for a couple of weeks and tried various changes in handlebar position and seat positions. Nothing worked for me to ride for more than a couple of miles. I'm a big guy and the rider position put all my upper body mass squarely on my wrists and that was painful!
Kyle at Bolton Ebikes invited me to try the Cheetah cruiser style ebike.  I rode it a little over 2 miles around their shop and was completely sold on the Cheetah! Kyle gave me a full refund towards the purchase of the Cheetah after I had offered $500 deduction because I had ridden the Foxbat for a couple of weeks (I believed that to be fair). So, Bolton Ebikes showed me that customer satisfaction is VERY IMPORTANT to them.
By the way, the very next day I took the Cheetah for a 10 mile enjoyable ride. I wouldn't recommend any place other than Bolton Ebikes for you ebike purchase.
Great products, great prices, and great service!

By the way, for other senior citizens, the Cheetah is the best ebike on the planet. Order one, ride one, and you'll be very pleased that you did!

<Text>Customer service is terrible at Bolton ebikes. I tried to cancel the bike order after I read I had to schedule an appointment to talk to someone on the phone. The  owner kyle assured me I wouldn't have to do that. Not true. Ive called, emailed, text messages ignored for 4 days to get warranty parts with no luck. I'm not scheduling an appointment 4 days out to talk on the phone. I have the 1000w fat tire less than 150 miles. its broke down 2 times. Just loved walking home. The  chain broke and did a lot of damage. I ended up having to buy my parts from another bike shop. Its easier  when you can talk to someone  on the phone.hope this helps someone not make the same mistake I did.  Good luck<//Text>< UserId.>

Kyle from Bolton Ebikes will bend over backwards to make sure you are satisfied with your purchase. Due to a post office issue, he replaced a lost part not just once, but twice.  You can't get much better than that!
He's also very helpful and knowledgeable, he will help out anyone ,even if they are not a customer. Bolton Ebikes, highly recommended!< /text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I am really happy with Bolton Ebikes and the Dillenger Hunter I bought. I did a lot of research before my purchase and had decided on a set of criteria I was looking for in an ebike. The Dillenger Hunter fit my needs, especially with the price from Bolton Ebikes, Except I wasn’t thrilled with the 10 amp hour battery capacity but I checked with Jessica at Bolton and she told me that additional OEM batteries for the bike were available. That sealed the deal for me.

A big thank you to Bolton Ebikes for their awesome assistance and support. They are a terrific asset for anyone considering buying an ebike.<//Text>< user_id>

Astoundingly good customer service!  I purchased an eKit upgrade 9 months ago and it took me a while to put everything together.  It worked brilliantly for a day, but then I must have damaged something because it stopped the next.  They walked me through a simple diagnosis to make sure what to send then sent me an entire replacement kit so I could try swapping out pieces and see what wasn't working.  I found the defective part, got it replaced, and was able to make the ride that weekend I was getting the bike together for.  And they asked for nothing other than for me to return the parts I wasn't using.  Since then everything has worked great and I have a new commute option.  Thank you so much!</Text>

They're helpful and then not helpful. Once they've got you stuck in a plan you don't seem to be able to get the same kind of help as when they're reeling you in.< /text>

I have had good experiences at this location.  The past two visits Arizona has helped me secure new devices for my wife and myself.  She has been pleasant, light hearted, and a joy to do business with.  She knows her product well and doesn't pressure you upsaling.< /text>

I received a relief phone and 3 days later the screen completely stopped working.  I have tried to locate a relief truck but can't find one anywhere.  And they said the Chico store has them to but yet  they don't.  I am just trying to see if I can exchange it or just get a new one. Nobody that works in either the Chico or oroville stores know where the trucks are and they couldn't even find the location on the website where its supposed to list location.< /Review>

came in on Sunday to buy a hotspot device. they didn't have any in stock so the rep asked if i wanted it to be shipped to my house. i am currently traveling for work so i am not going to be able to pick it up. the rep tells me that if i'm traveling, then they can ship to my current nearest t mobile store, which is in Redding. i tell him that i will think about it and he tells me if i do decide to get it shipped to another store, to call him back and he'll have it shipped for me. after leaving, i thought about it and decided to call them. i asked for the same rep that helped me in store. he then explains to me that he can't get it shipped to another store and that they usually don't send things to 3rd party stores.... when he literally just explained to me maybe less than an hour ago that he could. i, then, asked him if there was another corporate store that he was able to have it sent to. he says that this store was the closest corporate store. after a while of going back and forth, he orders the hotspot and requests to get it sent to the 3rd party store in Redding. later, i find out that there was a corporate store 20 mins away from me and that they did have hotspots in stock. this rep should have taken more time to help me find a store that had what i was looking rather than trying to get a sale in. i am leaving Redding this Friday and i'm not sure if my hotspot will come in on time and t mobile won't give me a refund.<//Review>

Excellent customer service. You can tell these guys care about you, and aren't pushy just to get a sale. The store in the mall is VERY aggressive, and I'm glad I found this other T-Mobile in Chico.</text>

<review>I had an excellent service from Maria a couple weeks ago when I decided to switch from Verizon to T-mobile and started  my paperwork but I didn't complete the transaction. ... So this last Friday night I went back to get my phone and finish all paperwork I had a terrible service experience from a different girl and the store manager I'm  really disappointed.  They didn't had the product I wanted when they told they did,  their computers frozen  for 40 minutes and also they put me on a totally different plan other than what they had promised  it's  sad and fkd up<//review></record>

Terrible customer service. The young lady that was 'helping' me was very rude, pushy, and un-helpful. It was only me and three employees in the store, but the employees were too busy messing with the in-store music and their headphone necklace things. My issue with a broken phone was not even close to be resolved, complete waste of time at that store.</Review>

Bought an Internet hotspot a while back and used it alot until I moved where there was no DATA covered. Thats changing now so I tried to return to TMobile as a customer. They wanted to fine me for returning with the hotspot and sim card that I paid cash for originally. Nope, I'm sticking with Verizon.</Text>

I saw Samsung Galaxy 6 Edge it was nice, however I found it to be intrusive, because i fingers we're always touching the edges of the phone, so I said nope don't like this one for sure, going back to researching,finally it was the July 3, 2013 I saw a ad saying LG Leon lte for $79.99 impressive price I said, I have to look that is my final choice if i can't see anything else, top of my list was htc m9 for their indescribable quality, 2nd LG G4 for the eye dropping design, I asked maria she was so kind, professional, expert adviser to see these delightful products, I liked the look however the price online was cheaper by $200.00, which was one big reason I didn't choose those other phones, later i said now i finally wanted to see final product the LG Leon Lte. It is so beautiful to hold see, easy of use no brainier, it's hand gushers to take picture by simply holding your hand open to catch the attend of the sensor then making fist to take the shoot in 3 second, and the awesome technology to tap the screen three times to turn on the screen what wonders is that phone. Maria helped to teach me other useful functions, she made my phone ready to use in a matter of a few minutes, I ask her to put the jump program so I can jump once I pay 50% of the cost of the phone. before she got everything  going she advise me to purchase accessories for the phone  like screen protector, case, charger,oh she also recommend a ue speakers that are made by Logitech which I didn't I bought I end up only paying $22.40 out the door, which was just the tax. I have not been so happy in my life of such a great buying experience in store a person to person is more satisfying then online we're their is no human relation, no real time experience first hand, no waiting for product just as soon as I grabbed it was my for the taking. I recommend Maria to make an appointment with her next time you go to T-Mobile US Retail Store. P.S call to see their wonderful promotions!< /Text>< Pictures>

Great place, great sandwiches!! Treat yourself to anything on their menu. The parking is tricky but they do offer curbside pick up to accommodate..just call them just before you get there. The service was just as pleasant!!< /review>

Every sandwich is a winner. Incredible sandwiches with superior staff. I would drive all the way out here for lunch every day if I could. Stop debating and just go and enjoy.< /review>

Really excellent sandwiches with great bread. I got the draper and loved it. There was also a line out the door (which isn't hard during a pandemic), but I think it speaks to how good the food is. I will definitely go back and try the arancini.<//text>

Went here today with my mate. I got the Classic Italian and he got the Antonia.
The meat on the classic was sliced to just the right thickness and piled high enough that I could not complain. It was freshly sliced which was perfect. It had a bit of a bite from the hot capicola and the calabrian Chiles but it didn't completely overwhelm the meats and cheese so the balance was spot on.. The shredded lettuce and the heirloom tomato added contrast in texture which was nice. My only issue is a personal preference in that I don't care for sesame seeds personally so next time I will ask for ciabatta.

My mate had the Antonia and commented on the avocado spread being the perfect level of flavor and consistency. He said the bread was spot on and garlic aioli mixed well with the meat, cheese, and avocado adding moisture to the roll.

We had some bottles half and half a imported from jersey. Didn't know that was a thing but it was great. I will come back here and would say this is up there with Roma and Claro's but with a kick on their take on the classic Italian sub.< /Review>

I’ve been looking forward to their grand opening. Finally!  Yesterday we got two sandwiches and dessert. I have mix feelings: their ingredients and flavors are delicious, but their bread is awful. The bread has to be amazing in order to make a great sandwich and that is not the case here.  We both enjoyed their ciabatta ok but did not care for the seeded baguette. It was too tough and overwhelming for a sandwich that size. It actually ruins an otherwise good sandwich. Maybe it’s a personal preference. Their lemon cake was good but is way TOO expensive at $10.  A chocolate cookie is $4! Best to just get the tricolore cookie.  We’ll go back and try it again. And for sure we’re grateful to have them in the neighborhood. 🍻

Update: went back again today. They were out of ciabatta so we ended up having to order sandwiches on their seeded baguette.  This experience was even worse than last time. We couldn’t even finish the sandwich.  It’s a pity they haven’t chose better bread.<//review>

I love Ggiata so much! Best east-coast style Italian grinder outside of the east coast. And their sea salt brownie is one of the best I’ve ever had in my life. Such a cool place, and the owners seem like caring guys who give back to the community whenever possible.</Text>

I am not sure what place all these other reviews are talking about, but I placed an order for pick up 2 days ago and had to go to a warehouse where there were 5 other kitchens producing food.  It was not ready when they said it was, and the guy told me it was just an estimate.

When I did get the food and all the way back home (because they don't deliver very far) it was great!  I loved it.  Sadly I will most likely never get it again because I am not traveling an hour each way for a sandwich.  If they ever open a restaurant, I will go.< /review>

Wow, so good we would come back tomorrow. We had the Italian and the masterpiece. I liked the masterpiece more - with the super creamy/slightly sweet stracciatella and chewy bread. My bf preferred the Italian because of the delicious tomatoes that complement the meat. The quality in the ingredients is noticeable.

Bay Cities Deli pales in comparison.<//review>

The appetizers were a home run. The salted cod churros were wild. Dinner was great the duck was the best. The sauce in the short ribs was very rich, but I ate it all. The outdoor rustic look was great. I would have like a spirits option, but the wine was good.

Such an eclectic menu and so reasonably priced! This place hit the spot after a long day of sightseeing in LA. The Fettuccine Verdi was my favorite and I'd go back just for that! The mushroom and beef was tender and delicious! The squid ink is unusual to most, but we really enjoyed it! Place is a gem!< /review>

A taste of New York in Los Angeles, can it get any better?? Yes, apparently it can with Ggiata! Awesome service and personally I am in love with all of their branding. We ordered The Don Pepe and The Classic Italian and I’ve never seen my cat react that excitedly to our food before. Haha. My boyfriend and I loved our sandwiches and will definitely be ordering again!< /Review>

We did a Yelp reservation for 2 at 8p and came on time. Lots of folks also did reservations as when we arrived the front lobby was busy. We had to wait 10 min. prior to seating, but no big deal. 10/10 I recommend sitting outside! The ambience with LED lights, 80s-90s music, and plants everywhere completed the experience.</text>

<Text>Dined here on a Saturday night with a reservation. The place is quite small and there was a long outside as we walked into the restaurant. However, we were seated right away and ordered our food. We ordered 4 rolls and grilled squid. Everything was good but there wasn't anything outstanding about this place either.< /Text>< name>

I rarely write reviews, but if, like myself, you have been searching far-and-wide for a real-deal Italian deli in LA, LOOK NO FURTHER. I'm from New York--which means that part of my essence is insisting that everything is better there (besides the weather, of course). Ggiata is an exception. This place is AMAZING! The food scene in LA is pretty good, but there's some obvious holes--pizza, bagels, and Italian delis. While Ggiata doesn't make pizza or bagels, they do Italian Deli and they DO IT WELL. The sandwiches are absolutely amazing, especially the masterpiece, and totally reasonably priced given the size and quality of ingredients. The farro salad is delicious and obviously fresh. The arancini is hot and crispy, but not oily and gross. Seriously, I can't believe these guys are the first one's to do this right in LA (others have tried), but I'm so glad they did! If you're thinking about ordering, just do it, you will not regret it.</Text><Time>1593208485917<//Time><gmap_id>0x80c2c70266414db7:0x25fcda223a5613c6</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Got an eggplant Parmesan sandwich that hardly had any cheese and came on sesame bread which I felt was strange as it totally took over the flavor of the sandwich. Sauce was good but eggplant itself wasn’t very flavorful.

<text>Great Happy Hour
Reasonable priced mixed drinks but great beer prices
Overall beer selection is varied and eclectic

The turkey burger and fries for HH is a outstanding value plus super satisfying

I usually sit at the bar So my take on service is skewed. Bar service is quick and knowledgeable

Parking can be challenging but well worth the challenge

A lot of Dodger fans ...Good or Bad<//text>< Gmap_id>

Ordered food online at 12:30pm, website said it would be ready at 1:14pm. I got to their pickup location at 1:30 pm, they told me it would be another 15 minutes. I came back in 15 minutes.... they told me it wasn’t ready yet but should be in a couple of minutes. I waited for 5 more minutes outside then went back in to check again. This time someone told me they would go back to check on my order.

It’s now 2:02 (more than 1 hr and 30 minutes) and I’m still waiting for my sandwich. 100% not worth it. Parking is horrible as well.< /text>

Casual but yummy spot for a weeknight dinner (apparently they're not open on weekends?). It's a Chipotle-style counter format where you choose your style of udon and quantity of toppings like green onions and sesame seeds.<//text>

We ordered our usual favorites - pretzels, Blvd salad, spicy chicken & turkey sandwiches. As always, the food was amazing! I love that the spicy chicken sandwich was actually spicy and the fries were still crispy. We also ordered cocktails which came in cute little mini jugs. Loved that they added the usual add ons that are included in the drinks on the side for us. The drinks were delicously strong, just how I like em! We also greatly appreciated the bonus items we received.<//review>< pics>

I did my good diligence and looked up tapas on Yelp and Running goose came up. The pictures, reviews  really sold us. Well... at least me because I've never had tapas so what the heck did I know. Moving on, we get seated our waiter was super nice and attentive (we were the only people there) my Bf was skeptical reading over the menu. He was like "wait, this is tapas?" I'm like listen here this is not my fault but we are here and we will eat! We told ourselves we would try new places and step out of our comfort zone. So, it's only right that we stayed. We ordered each tostada to taste, the Gabas, the Brie and a Salmon burger/sand which. We shared everything took turns taking bites. He was not impressed lol. He kept talking about the tapas he had in Madrid (such a show off) and I was like welp lol I have nothing to compare it to. Everything was delicious to me. BUT what lost me and lost a star was that Salmon sandwich that they called it. I didn't realize it didn't come with Fries! They have to be ordered separately womp! Then the weird relish didn't do it for me. The Salmon did not taste fresh and the buns were  just soggy from whatever sauce they put on.<//Text>

WOW!! honestly, will pick this over Howling Rays when it comes to line comparison. The line is a reasonable length, only waited like 7 minutes. I came around 1pm, I advise coming before 1:30pm, cuz when I was waiting on my food and then eventually eating it, ppl were coming in every minute and 99.8% the chairs were filled up. I ordered 'one mild chicken slider' and 'fries'! It was $9 something (less than $10). The wait was about 10 minutes and when I got it WOW! The chicken was hot so I had to take my time, so I divided into my fries while I waited for the sandwhich to cool; the crunch was so delicate and filled with so much flavor. I dipped them into the beige color sauce which enhanced their taste! Now onto the sanwhich! EXCELLENT! I personally thought the portion was great, the bun was soft, not toasted at all, but the other components like the flavor of the mild chicken, pickles(which I LOVE),and sauce made up for the lack of bun flavor. It  was OFF THE CHAIN! They give you HELLA fries(not complianig tho). Overall great first time experience & I will def be back! Very yummy!<//review>

<Review>I've came here a couple of times through the years and I must say - whether I opt to try something new or stick to my usual bow tie pasta with di pilla sauce - Di Pilla's never disappoints and definitely satisfies my Italian pasta and pizza craving.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

Greasy, soggy, a little underwhelming.

EDIT: 1 month later I feel very different! Their sandwiches improve in your memory over time<//Review>

<Review>Tucked in an alley in the Warehouse District where it's so busy there's no place to be homeless, let alone park. Give the Bentley keys to the harried Valet. The line to get in starts to stretch down the block by 4:30.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Nice and friendly staff, clean and nice place. However when I was in pain for an ear infeccion the doctor prescribed some ear drops that cost $260 dllrs, now im not complaining about the cost if they were to meke me feel better but the drops just got me worse, I couldn't not sleep because of the pain I was feeling. I just felt that they just wanna make a profit out that situation.<//text>

<gmapID>0x80c2c482b183d23f:0x965a7767329a62a0</gmapID><text>I have 9 symptoms that are overactive thyroid symptoms. I didn't go to my primary physician because my insurance was dropped due to furlough and was afraid it would be too expensive. I should've paid the extra and just went to my primary. My issues with this place are as follows.
#1- didn't see an actual doctor
#2- didn't want to do a blood test to check my thyroid even after voicing symptoms.
#3- PA came in only thinking my issue was poor air quality from the second he stepped into the room.
#4- prescribed me Prednisone without checking my thyroid levels.
#5- wanted to do a $50 swab test on my throat for infection but would not do a blood test. A blood test, I would think, would be essential if you're prescribing something and you have zero clue about the person other than what's written on a piece of paper.

I will now pony up even more money to go to my primary. I can guarantee he won't prescribe me a drug that could have adverse effects on my thyroid without doing a blood test. It's not their fault though. It's mine. I know these places aren't in the business to care about your health. They're there to churn and burn as many patients as they can in the shortest amount of time for the most money. So my honest opinion of this place is, if you're wanting to piss away $130, go. Don't expect good service. Everyone was friendly. Place seemed clean. Just unhappy with service.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< user_id>

They had a separate entrance for rapid Covid testing (i may use this in the future if necessary). It was a clean facility. I had to wait a little bit longer than I would have liked in the waiting room (but thats to be expected in a walk-in urgent care clinic) but the chairs were spaced-out fairly well. The appointment was fast and the doctor seemed thorough. And so far my ear feels better. Overall good experience...

I have used Advanced Urgent Care in the past so this was not my first time there. I was seen quickly by the doctor who was kind and attentive. I was diagnosed and received a prescription within a short period of time. The office staff was friendly and helpful.<//review>

<review>This is the most inept Doctors office I have ever been to. I highly urge you to go elsewhere for medical care. I recently asked for a refill on an antibiotic until I could see a dermatologist next week and it is the only thing that is helping keep the infection under control. They declined to refill the antibiotic. (Even though they have done so in the past.) They have no policies that are consistent and they don't want to help you.
Secondly, When I arrived I asked the receptionist if they could do a culture test, they said yes but then later said they couldn't.
They are not competent and breached patient confidentiality. When I arrived home, I realized they had given me a copy of another patient's medical records along with my prescription. I contacted that patient to let her know that they gave me her confidential information and she was so upset that they were so negligent! She is planning on suing them for breaching patient confidentiality.
The manager Avalon was extremely rude and Dr. Miguel doesn't really care about his patients. Doesn't do tests he just guessed what you might have. Completely unacceptable.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c2c482b183d23f:0x965a7767329a62a0</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I had a really nice experience here, which is great because you don’t want to stress about poor care when you’re sick and in pain. I was helped immediately, and after filling out the necessary paperwork I was seen quickly by a friendly nurse and then by the doctor, who was attentive and kind. I felt relief leaving after the care I received</review>

All of the staff were quick to answer any and all questions before and while I was there. There was little wait time and very affordable. I was stung by a sting ray and about 10 days after it puffed up and was painful to walk on. Obviously concerned, I knew I needed to go to an Urgent Care. My PA, Derek Asimus was very knowledgeable and explained exactly what was going on and how to fix the issue. I immediately felt relief. My foot is now in great shape, no swelling or
pain. I'm back to my active self and jumping on it. Needleas to say, I'd recommend this place to anyone. Thank you to all of the staff!  ... even to those who smiled or just showed me where the bathroom was. Everything counts. Thanks again!< /text>< pictures>

<Review>I was really-pleased with my experience at AUCP. Even though they couldn't take my esoteric medical insurance, the treatment they gave me was speedy & effective. For the first time in ages I was afflicted with poison oak (via hiking Dawn Mine #caution) which caused my eye to swell severely. For less than $200, I got the consult, steroid shot & prescription — all within an hour. Next day, the rashes are mostly gone and I no longer look like John Merrick.
Thanks again, doctors & staff!<//Review>< pics>

This is truly by far the best walk in/urgent care I've ever been to. And I've been to quite a few in Arizona and California. You're greeted by friendly staff, who as well are very helpful. You're seen very quickly, and out the door all in under 45 minutes in both my experiences. Both times I went for an ear infection. The first time I was given my script there for amoxicillin and didn't even have to worry about going to a pharmacy. 2nd time I had to get my script filled at a pharmacy for drops which was fine. I paid out of pocket both times cause they accept my insurance health net but not health net through medi-cal. No biggie because it was totally worth it for the everything else experience. $150 the 1st visit and thats including the antibiotics , $110 for the 2nd visit. I highly recommend this place for everyone needing great and quick care.< /Review>

The staff was insightful and attentive. They did necessary tests and an exam by a very skilled Doctor. My assessment was made post haste and they notified the hospital for further, immediate care. The ER was ready for my arrival, where further in-depth tests found a very serious condition, from which I am now recovering. I am very grateful to AUC. They made all the difference.< /review>

<Text>I'm an RN and am skeptical about seeking medical services outside of my primary care provider team. I've been to Advanced Urgent Care twice (once for my daughter & once for myself). On both occasions we received excellent care from the NP and the PA. Additionally, we were in and out in under an hour with an accurate diagnosis and an evidence-based treatment plan. The front office staff was also courteous and professional.< /Text></record>

I've been in the area for two years and have had 3 occasions to go to Advanced Urgent Care of Pasadena.  I found the waiting and exam rooms clean, neat and pleasantly designed.  The staff was always professional yet friendly. My wait times were always less than 1 hour.  I had good follow up from the doctor or staff when there was a lab test. Now if they can find a quicker cure for the common cold, I'll really be thrilled!<//Review>

I was especially impressed that they carried a rate chart for everything (x-rays, brace equipment, etc.) so that I could make an informed decision about what treatments to pursue.

I always get excellent care from the doctors at this facility. They are smart, conservative, and are able to give me the help that I need. I don't have to wait long, and it's a pleasant experience from arrival to departure. Thank you!</Review>

The staff was very helpful and friendly; the Dr. Knew his stuff and I was relieved that I didn't have the illness I thought I had. They also gave me a referral for an MRI the same visit. I highly recommend going here for urgent care.</Review>

My wife and I both had to go to the urgent care this week on separate occasions. We were both seen quickly. The staff were all pleasant and explained everything well. We will definitely be using this urgent care in the future.</text>

What a great service. Clean, organized, good care and kind people. I went in when I didn't bounce back after the flu and got a diagnosis and the medication to make a full recovery. The whole experience was satisfying and I'd go back again if I need it.<//text>

<review>The head doctor cared for my case personally and expedited a transfer of care as I requested to an orthopedic surgeon.  The staff are medical professionals, not customer service specialist, so don't expect too much.  They're busy and are focused on your health.

This office is spotless and clean as an ideal doctor's office would be.

Lastly I highly recommend to be careful when pulling into the parking lot in the back.  It's a single long driveway for both entering and exiting the lot.  I discourage street parking as my ride's car was nearly towed when leaving the clinic on my first visit.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I then came to Advanced Urgent Care and was pleasantly surprised by the efficient staff and cleanliness of the facility. I had an infected elbow and Dr. Hinde was terrific; she diagnosed the problem quickly, was knowledgeable, explained everything, and had a really kind way about her patient care. Very happy with my two follow-up visits as well! Thank you Advanced Urgent Care!</review>< Pictures>

My Four year old had a ticket splinter in his index finger that he would not let us remove. Fortunately, I found this urgent care open on a Sunday, the wait was less than 15 minutes, it was super clean AND had a beautiful children's area (which soothed my terrified son), AND the staff was amazingly professional and patient.

The nurse was super good with my son, he earned my scared son's trust, and although the nurse and I had to hold my son down for the doctor to remove the splinter, the doctor got it done and we were out of their in a short time. My son was a happy camper with his prize from the treasure box. Thank you very much! Loved your urgent care!< /text>

<Review>I came in early Sunday morning with lower back pain. The staff greeted me and was friendly and courteous. I waited 30 min. until I was called; fast for urgent care and the medical staff was also friendly and professional. Ms. Tiffany Bryant treated me with care and concern, she was thorough and undersatding. I got two injections for my back and prescription medicine. I was in and out in less than 1.5 hrs. Awesome medical staff! Thank you again!<//Review>< pics>

They had a good attitude and took care of me promptly being patient with the questions I had because I had not been in a clinic like this one before so I was confused on why I was waiting. But after a little bit they took care of me and I was on my out without much time having passed by.<//Text>

For an Urgent Care facility to be this comfortable of an environment and so efficiently run is nothing small. I've never been as at ease under these circumstances. The entire staff, from front desk check in to triage, were extremely polite and caring and created a seamless patient care experience. It only gets better once you meet the Physicians on staff. I had the pleasure of being seen by Dr. Phillips. His caring demeanor and calming bedside manor makes you actually feel as though you just met with your personal family physician.
It's never good to be ill but, it is wonderful knowing  there is such a place as this to go when you are. Thank you for your care!

<username>Wei-Lin Wang</username><review>My experience was not good. Although the staff were nice, the provider that I met was not. The provider rushed through my examination (waiting time 15 mins and examination time 5 mins). She did not address my issues and my symptoms did not get better after taking the medicine she provided. Totally waste my time and money.

I would like to make another update. I went there another time because my illness did not get better. The staff were good as usual, and I met the same doctor again. I still waited for quite a long time and she stayed for a relative short time. However, the doctor addressed my issue this time and I am finally feeling better. So I gave it 3 stars.</review><gmap_id>0x80c2c482b183d23f:0x965a7767329a62a0</gmap_id><date>1574704001762</date><userid>116232802847534272684< /userid><Resp>None< /Resp><pics>None</pics>< rating>

Just left urgent care and the nurse practitioner wasn’t the nicest person, overall rude. My wife’s sick asking questions because she’s concerned about her health and when the nurse practitioner leaves the room she vents to her coworkers about her irritation of answering the questions? She can be heard through the walls. Terrible to hear that when your already feeling sick. Makes you wonder the level of care you get at this place if leadership can’t handle simple questions.</Text>

I believe this is a quick, and easy place to get a medical Dr without an appointment.
My only 'concern' is the music they play is not suitable for a waiting room of sick and hurting people.
The music used to match the calming scenes on the large flat screen. Today they have decided to enjoy the loudly played sounds of reggae.
My guess is the 'owner' is unaware of this music change, otherwise they would consider their ailing patients.

<review>Recently moved to Pasadena from Seattle WA.  When I got sick a week later, I consulted YELP for a good urgent care to go to.  Advanced, and Dr. Phillips there, were professional, high tech, clean, and quick.  I waited no more than 20 minutes to be seen.  Bronchitis is almost gone now thanks to AUC of Pasadena!<//review></record>

< Review>
I visited on 08/03/19. I had a deep laceration on my right hand. The Doctor looked at it & determined it was too late for stitches. After testing my hand to make sure no tendons or nerves were damaged, he wrote me a Rx for antibiotics. A few minutes later a nurse came in to give me a Tetanus shot, clean & re-wrap my hand. I had to wait 10 minutes just in case I had a reaction to the shot, which I didn't, then I paid my $40 & went home. I think it was about 1.5 hours total from when I arrived to when I left.

Thanks Marc Shomer for following up on my email regarding my billing questions & exceeding my expectations.<//Review>

<Review>Had the pleasure to meet Dr. Phillips again after my second visit. He is the nicest man on earth and very caring to his patients. The facility is clean and welcoming with their great staff. I came in on a Saturday at 3:55pm, was seen at 4:10pm, and got out at 4:30pm. I love how this urgent care doesn’t take long to take in patients. I had a cyst in my eye and Dr. Phillips was very informative that it’s an infection of a gland in the eye and that it’ll go away with an antibiotic eye drop. Very sweet man. Thank you Dr. Phillips! I’ll definitely come back to this urgent care!<//Review>< pics>

I have been in the Los Angeles/Pasadena area for work for a couple months now and need to be seen by a doctor. Looked up Urgent Care facilities and found Advanced Urgent Care. The staff is very nice, responsive and knowledgeable. The NP was very helpful and thorough. She listened to all of my information and suggested running some tests. I would recommend Advanced Urgent Care of Pasadena to everyone. Great facility, clean rooms and waiting area, and new equipment.<//review>

This is place is absolutely the best urgent care I have ever visited. Professionalism from the moment you walk in the door. Beautiful facility, friendly staff and lovely Doctors; that ask the questions, many thorough questions. I was taken aback to see Dr.'s actually inquiring and seemingly genuinely concerned for my care. Additionally, I have never had to wait more than 15-20 minutes to be seen.
I recommend this facility greatly. and do often, to my friends and family.<//Text>

<Text>Love this urgent care!  The wait time is short compared to any other urgent care or ER.  The Dr. and staff are very professional.  Their charges are reasonable - they keep you informed every step of the way so there are no surprises at the end of the visit.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs "urgent" medical care.  And thank you for taking care of me!<//Text><time>1534815061533</time><user_id>118042706822942430282< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I love this place. They were quick, clean, and efficient. The doctor was clear with his diagnosis and treatment was immediate. The technicians were very good. I needed 2 injections and they were done in a minute. My reason for not giving 5 stars is 2 part. I came in for a puncture wound. The doctor told me what my treatment was, but gave me no instructions for after care. And the technicians did not wrap up my slightly oozing wound when I left. So I went home wrapped myself up and then Googled aftercare. They may seem like a lot for done people, but I have some first aid training do it wasn't a big deal to me.< /review>< Pics>

We are from out of town and had a real need to see a doctor. This urgent care was thankfully open late. They were very friendly and professional. The office was clean and cute. The doctor we saw was very thorough and she showed concern. They told us prices up front for each procedure. It was really great to have had such a positive experience!</Text>

<text>I am on a trip here and leaving from here to go on an even longer trip with the family -- I can't be ill. I have what appeared to me to be a sinus infection, and feel miserable. I found this facility online, read reviews, and went, hoping for the best. I am so glad that I did!!

This place is unbelievably awesome!! Thank you so much!! Everyone at the facility was kind, professional, understanding, and caring from beginning to end.

The check-in was simple and straightforward. I was given a cold bottle of water, which was very nice. The paperwork was simple to fill out and the receptionist was very friendly and explained everything I needed to know at that point.

The nurse/P.A. was very friendly and listened carefully to my symptom. He also asked appropriate questions and listened to the answers.

Dr. Segall is simply one of the best medical professionals that I have ever had treat me, and unfortunately I have had to have a lot. She was very receptive and responsive to my thoughts and concerns, and gave me a plan of action that will have me as good as new in no time.

I cannot say enough good things about this facility. They are fantastic.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c482b183d23f:0x965a7767329a62a0</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I went on a Sunday afternoon (yesterday) and I anticipated having to wait quite a long time. Thankfully not. The waiting room is clean, staff are courteous and professional. And I was thankful that they triage and took a young boy ahead of me who was obviously more urgent than I (he came in after me). The front desk staff were nice, smiles on their faces. The medical assistant just graduated from nursing school and was professional, knowledgeable and kind. I saw a PA-C Scinta (???) not sure how to spell her name. Very good "bedside" manner, professional, educated me on what to look out for and educated me to what was going on and why I was experiencing what I had going on. If ever I have to visit urgent care, I will definitely go back there. This was my second time there and both times were excellent experiences - and they have free parking in the back. Thank you!</Review>

I love Advanced Urgent Care. The only issue I had was I informed the physicians assistant how sensitive I am to certain antibiotics and requested one that I know does not cause bad side effects but was given something that made me so sick that I couldn't work or go to class(Doxycycline). Once I discontinued it I was still extremely sick for 5 more days. They ended up prescribing me what I originally requested and that got rid of my infection.

I just recommend to them, that if a patient tells you that they are very sensitive to certain things and are informing you about other things have helped in the past, try to listen to them. I know my body and what I can and can't tolerate. I reacted to the Doxycycline like most people that talk about it online, extreme fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, extreme headache, nausea, dizziness. I guess maybe Im a wimp but Ive never felt so bad for so long.</Text>

Straightforward service, that doesn't waste your time by giving you what you don't need. I had an ingrown toenail removed here by Dr. Phillips, and it was the best experience in an Urgent Care I've had to date with such an operation, and I've been to multiple similar clinics throughout the years of dealing with it. Highly recommend this place.</review>

<review>Wow, exceptional service for an otherwise unpleasant thing to deal with in life. Because who really wants to be at Urgent Care if they can avoid it!? The entire staff was friendly, engaging and supportive. The last time I was there was 2 years ago and Dr. Phillips remembered me! I was shocked. Anytime I need a doc which is rare (thankfully!) I will choose this clinic. 10/5 stars!<//review></record></dataset><record>

I went to Advanced Urgent Care of Pasadena on Arroyo Parkway on 6/9/2019. The whole staff was really great including the medical staff and especially the Doctor who treated me. I just wanted to thank them for helping with my medical problems.< /review>

Staff was very friendly. I was seen for injuries from a car accident on very short notice. I hate hospitals so I started here to avoid admission to ER. Treatment was professional and weren't trying to rush me even though it was closing time. Although,  I don't suggest getting there last minute as it does fill up with patients. Thankful for the help. Not thankful for the shot in the butt .
Cheers<//Review>

<text>I came to Advanced Urgent Care of Pasadena hardly able to breathe due to a sudden severe case of bronchitis.  I was seen promptly, given a breathing treatment from a nebulizer, and immediately felt miraculously better. I was then given a steroid shot, a prescription for an inhaler, and released. I was told I should keep an appointment with my doctor which I had made previously, and cautioned that I should take care not to let the bronchitis change into bronchial pneumonia. The treatments cost me nothing in advance because my insurance coverage is expected to cover the cost.

In short, I feel I received excellent, prompt, and effective care by very kind and caring professionals.  I will certainly recommend Advanced Urgent Care to anyone in need<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I was in a car accident. Walked into this center and being that I don’t have insurance or money at the time I entered I was told I could walk over to Huntington hospital said it’s only two and a half blocks away and there I could be seen they deal with my type. I felt dizzy and they still looked at me and repeated I could leave. It’s urgent care. No care was shown or given and they didn’t uphold the oath. I’d never go back I’d die first.</text>

The best Urgent Care I have been to!  For my regular doctor, I have to get an appt and wait at least a couple of weeks.  You can just walk right into this place and see a doctor!  It's beautifully decorated, clean and serene.  The staff are all very friendly with smiles on their faces.  I highly recommend you try them.  I  was very impressed, this place is very well managed.<//text>

Amazing experience! Very kind staff. Everyone from the receptionist, nurse, and Doctor were very happy, professional, and attentive. They got me in and out with my prescription in 20 minutes. Doctor Seagall was very thorough in her exam, asking all the appropriate questions and even followed up with me to make sure I was feeling better. Highly recommended.<//Review>

Nice office and clean also, pleasant receptionist .
As far as the Assistant has a big EGO and ATTITUDE.  He took my BP he didn't give the the numbers, I had to ask also took my temperature he wrote it on the chart again I had to ask for temp.num. the Dr. Himself was quick don't know how you can diagnose someone when you don't run any tests!   Unsatisfied patients  and will NOT recommend to any of my family members or friends.<//review>

Got here at 6.57p and still sat waiting at 8.21p Yes they're closed but we're still waiting. I filled out all the forms, but the admin didn't catch that the patient wasn't me, although it's my insurance card. It was an annoying start to my first visit here. Other UC facilities have been faster than this.

Once we got to see the doctor it went very quickly and we left with relevant info and a prescription. As reviewer Jeah said - this isn't built for pediatric patients (in our case vital stats finger gadget didn't get a reading despite 2 nurses trying) but the family practitioner was good re. the skin rash.  For more serious stuff we'd prob consider CHLA ER.

I had to call to get the prescription sent to a pharmacy and that went faster. No complaints there and I got a call back within 30 mins.</review>

<review>My daughter was developing a fever and swelling on her leg. Sure enough it was an infection.  I found a new urgent care clinic and just did a walk in... I was so lucky I did, these guys did a great job. Very comprehensive and caring. I was impressed with the staff and how quickly we were taken care of. We went for our follow-up and the infection is much!@! better.</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>They say on the website they accept Healthcard Partners, when I get here they say they don’t take it. I was feeling my heart trobbing..the doctor did a 5-min EKG and said ‘it’s probably not a heart attack’. Confirm your insurance is accepted over the phone and avoid if you have heart issues. Otherwise clean place, short line and courteous staff.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

This place is great. Friendly professional staff especially a medical assistant named Jazmine. She is one of the very few medical assistants that was able to draw my blood the very first try. I usually have bruising after I get my blood drawn not this time. This place is clean the way urgent cares should be. I recommend this place highly especially if you have trouble getting your blood drawn.</review>

I had went in with a bad pain in my side and I went in to see what was causing it; saw the doctor after paying almost 100 dollars just to be seen then all I got for paying that amount was "I think" n walked out with no help of what was wrong with me; in the end I ended up going some place else my family had recommend , right off the back they told me what was going on instead of being stuck waiting for another "oh I think" would never come to this place again or recommend it to anyone
Update: I had gotten a phone call from one of the people at the clinic explain to me about my experience and had made everything more clear about why my experience was the way it was< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Went to Advanced for some neck pain that flared up, prior to this neck pain I had been feeling some irregularities in my everyday life. I explained the neck pain and they gave me a few X-Rays to check on any structural damage. Before sending me on my way with muscle relaxers to help my neck, they did a precautionary Hemoglobin test due my lack of color and the other symptoms I described. They then found that my levels were third of what they should of been and sent me directly to the Emergency Room with recommendation of immediate admittance. I was later diagnosed with Leukemia and this extra test which was administer by Advanced could have quite possible saved my life. Thank you Advanced from the bottom of my heart, I caught this sickness early due to your diligence and extra care. I would recommend this facility and staff to anyone in the area.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I was seen within a few minutes( after my insurance was verified)
Maybe it was my insurance but I thought the price was extreme.
But  I’m glad I went. The people @ the front desk were very friendly and professional. The doctor was fine. The lady who gave me breathing treatments & an injection seemed a bit disctracted. She said the treatment would be 10 mins, the first time she returned well after 10 mins(I told her I didn’t like anything covering my face, she said once the treatment began I would feel better & I did, but once it stopped, I was uncomfortable. The second treatment she never returned to the room, I removed it myself & the doctor came to speak to me again had to turn the machine off.
Other than that, I would return.</text>

Wonderful Urgent Care!
Everyone from the physicians to the assistant staff are professional, compassionate and kind.
The facility is immaculate and runs smoothly and efficiently.
Absolutely high praises for this place (coming from a health care professional myself).
Many thanks particularly to Dr. Shomer & Salpie.</text>

<Text>I had the worst exprience from customer service in this care center verry disappointing im wondering how there still in business
I had small draining operation for skin infection
And i went after tow days  the doctor was not comfortable from the result he found that the infection was not cleared completely so he asked me  to follow up with him in two days to see how its gonna be after 2 more days
he said let me see you every couple days to see the results without charging me any visitation fee
The Infection came back as before and more painful so i went back to see the doctor or any body can help me
When i arrived there the front desk didn't let me see the doctor before i pay visitation fee
when I told them what the  what is exactly the doctor told me about no charge because you already paid full for the issue to be completely resolved
The wanser was very simple the doctor doesn't have the Wright to make this call or decision
Doctor opinion  mean nothing i thought there joking for a second but they were not
Very Unprofessional i just decide to ask for my record and  leave
I don't recommend this clinic to anybody...<//Text>< Pictures>

I went in for a Tb test and tb reading. Place was nice and clean. Receptionist, nurses, and doctors were friendly. Way better priced than a CVS clinic. CVS clinic will charge for the tb test and then charge you AGAIN for the tb test reading. This place will only charge you one set price for both (half the price of a CVS clinic).<//review>

<Text>Doctor's are great, saw my girlfriend within 10 minutes. And was done at 1:38 (got a text)  All she needed was a shot and it's 2:24 literally 40+ mins passed and she's still not done? Are the nurses really getting paid to lag that much? Doctor's should really check on that, it's ridiculous that someone has to wait that long for a shot and perscription. Overall time: 2hrs and 15 mins. Oh and good to see 2 patients that came after her was able to get out before her.< /Text></record>

<Text>This place would have gotten a 5 star review for the treatment I received from Jody, who sits at the front desk, to the nurse who took my ekg, to my caring physician. They all were amazing with great bedside manners, especially with why I was there. Then comes the Asian kid at the front desk, named Dorian, who tells me that (even though I explained to him that my wallet had just been stolen last week) to just bill me the $50 so I can pay it as soon as I receive my cards, which should be in a few days. He then refuses to give me my prescriptions over $50 damn dollars and I'm experiencing PAINS IN MY CHEST???!!! His only response is "That's policy." What kind of Urgent "Care" facility holds you meds over $50??????? You hold my medication, but you didn't hesitate to bill my insurance! That is NOT how you treat patients!< /Text><UserId.>114426185493146195574< /UserId.>< name>

I was in and out in 60 minutes or so (first visit).  Had to return a few weeks later with bronchitis.  Was seen in 15 minutes and received all meds there.  Again staff was outstanding, as was the doctor.  I so appreciate the one-stop service 5 minutes from my house.<//review>< Pictures>

<date>1508959177127</date><rating>3< /rating><text>Not a good or bad review, but as someone with dysautonomia who needs the occasional electrolyte replacement (and sometimes still don't know what's going on and if I really need an IV) this urgent care doesn't do IVs, and I think the one time before I was in there doesn't do labs either. Since I know a lot of people with chronic illnesses will be checking out reviews like this first and sometimes rely on urgent cares for urgent but not emergency stuff like this I feel it's worth mentioning.

Also went into this urgent care once way before I was hit with dysautonomia just for what was obviously the flu. Was hoping a blood test and some antivirals might help since I caught it early but was given antibiotics (wouldn't help the flu...it's viral) and no lab and more or less just laughed at and shooed out the door. My dysautonomia is most likely the post viral subtype and started not long after that bout with the flu :/

This place has short wait times though if you're just going in for vaccines or something minor.<//text>< pics>

<Review>totally thought i walked into a day spa on accident lol.  this place's interior rivals the getty or something.  beautiful.  i cut my arm today deeper than i could handle on my own and needed to get it looked at, so i googled the closest walk-in urgent care and found this place.  i was nervous at first because the only memories i have from going to the doctor as a kid were when i was damn near dead, scared and had a healthy "stranger danger"...but this was a totally different experience.  it didnt look or feel like i was at the doctor's office...like, at all.  aesthetics aside, the people working behind the counter were super sweet and the doctor who took care of me appeared to be a genuinely nice guy.  i got stitched up and was back on my bike before my starbucks got cold.  doctor visits have always felt like going to the DMV before, but this place felt like the four seasons.  if you're ever unlucky enough to ride your bike into a pasadena parking meter too, i recommend this place<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Just left there with my daughter who was in pain. And they would not see us because the only form of payment we had on us was AMEX, and a Check. They would not accept either. What a complete joke.< /text>

Additionally, AMEX fees are very high and its not sustainable.  So sorry we where not able to help you.  We want to be your Urgent Care Near Me and hopefully we can have a second chance.'}< /Resp>

Waited 10 minutes beyond my appointment time to get my Covid test. I opted for results via text which came within 15 mins, but the text isn’t much for the proof of testing I need. And you can’t view the results via the Solv app they use to schedule testing. So I need to go back there to get the results on paper.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I like a lot of studios, but PA Rehearsal Studios always seems to give my band the 5 star treatment! The rooms are nice, a good size and the acoustics are perfect. The equipment is good as well. We will be back!</Review>

We got room number 5 and it was very good...
They have a small parking in the back but you can also park in the street.

Make sure to book your room in advance to have peace of mind. It’s a very busy place, so don’t be lazy!

They also have snacks and beverages available for purchase.

As a side note, there is a very good restaurant close by 😁😁😋 it’s called Persepolis!< /Text>

< Review>
This is by far the coolest, nicest, most accommodating, friendliest, and most committed to musicians/artists, rehearsal studio I have ever been in!
From the personalized treatment from André the owner who you will know by name due to his friendly and approachable demeanor, to John the guy who works at the front desk and will do whatever it takes to make sure you get the most from your room rental... I mean this guy goes as far as to recommend downloads and apps to ensure you get the most from your rehearsing experience! Anywhere from booking, to answering your questions, to location, VIP treatment, and great looking place and atmosphere, this place beats by far any other rehearsal studio I have ever been in!
This place looks, feels, fancy, and they treat you like a rockstar! Worth mentioning too that their prices are the best! I looked at their website and booked me an amazing deal!
The rooms are fully equipped, clean, and nicely decorated.
I now have a place that I feel happy to come to and feels like the perfect 2nd home to all artists!
Thank you guys for making of my music journey a joyful and smooth one!<//Review>

Incredible rehearsal studio out in the Valley! Parking lot out back, great prices and beautiful rehearsal spaces and the owner is so rad! Snacks and drinks available for purchase as well as top quality gear for hire if you wish. You can usually spot at least 2-3 of the best session musicians from around the country sitting in on rehearsals!</Text>

The staff was truly professional and on point.  The rooms are setup functional to accommodate true rehearsal stage. The back outdoor break area was perfect spent a few minutes with a legendary rock band I met there. The back line is top of the line latest high end equipment. The hours was perfect to accommodate all of us at different times. Andre the co-founders knowledge of music, sound, and live stage shows was exactly what was needed to get us set up. Meg the co-founder was very professional and had every part of the arrangements ready and prepared. Thank you to Andre and Meg to create the perfect studio. What you get at PA Studios is second to none to any famous studio in Hollywood but at prices that real musicians can actually afford. You guys are what makes us realize our dreams.< /text>

< Review>
Booked our first practice session in LA at this band rehearsal space. Got there and the place was jamming. Very cool and talented people there. Met the owners of the place same time too. Both were there and pretty much gave us a tour. Love their setup and rooms. Make it even better, they got a back outdoor area with tables and stuff... So we took a break and chilled outside with a beer and smokes. This definately our new hangout for band practice... Thanks Andre and Meg. You guys rock. 🎸< /Review>

I'm not from this little bitty town and its just a working man's little town with nothing special even the out side vies of the pizza place but inside the pizza place is the best pizza you'll find in an almost 100 degree circle. So if your with in that circle and you are hungry for an outstanding home style pizza I would recommend going there and ordering a pizza just remember because of the covid 19 there's take out only and no eating places on the outside either. Enjoy.<//text>

<Review>Their prices fluctuate depending on where you look, the front door compared to inside. I asked for something to replace the potato wedges on their lunch deal, and they gave me absolutely no other options.
Food was still good.< /Review></record>

Prices on the online menu differ from inside the restaurant. Delivery fee for in this small town is $4.99? Seriously it's a hop skip and a jump to lots is these houses.<//text>

-To star of it was pricey !
-Second they took more than an hour for delivery (From Earlimart to Pixley) and it arrived cold
-Third we got the wrong flavor wings from what we had ordered.
-Wings were supper dry and tasted like they were at least 3days old super reheated.
-Pizza flavor was not that great either not even my kids liked it.
Overall First time i buy from here and will not be buying from here or recomending anyone.<//review>

Heading to Dodger Stadium for a game, got hungry on the way but didnt want to stop at the chain places to eat. Pizza and wings was a great place to eat, the food was fresh and tasted delicious. Local places are the best to stop, I recommend this spot.< /Review>

Pizza and wings is amazing there delivery is so fast and there pizza is the best in this area the price is just right the people are kind and there's TV and family dinning. Just all around a great place for a relaxing time or even a quick bite because there fast and affordable. Highly recommend this place if you passing through 99 and Earlimart as they are not far from the exit or entrance of the freeway.</text>

It’s Walmart... but really do we need to lock up socks. I understand issues with thief but seems like a bigger deterrent to buy with slow customer service associates. Maybe busy with other customers I understand but really locking socks and underwear up<//review>

<review>This is the walmart store closest to my house. I enjoy shopping there but never thought of doing a review. My most recent visit I found a video game that regularly goes for $130 online or at other stores even the walmart website, but I guess my homestore had both variations for $90 brand new sealed box. Sometimes stores sell the same items at different prices due to its stock and exclusivity around the area. I got it but I had to wait like 15 minutes because there was nobody in the electronic area that could open the door for the game.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I had a really great experience at Walmart today. I was in search for a bike and they helped me pick out the perfect bike for me. It’s been along time since I’ve ridden a bike and I was a little nervous about how I was going to get the bike home. She went above and beyond help me out to my car and even assisted me with putting the bike rack on the car. Thank you for the wonderful customer service I will definitely be back to shop at this location.<//review>

<review>This place gives me the feel of an unfinished Walmart, especially wgen you walk in. I can't put a finger on exactly what about it gives me that vibe. The staff(till) are friendly but the self checkout ones just seem bored. Its not a place I think to go unless I really need to go for something specific.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808565bee1a59bad:0x7fd8bab7c785af69</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

What can you say about a Walmart, especially a Super Walmart like this one.  They have a huge selection of just about everything from diapers to donuts and holding tank additives.  There service is pretty good as long as you aren't expecting any department level knowledge.  They have a pretty efficient customer service center which is good.  There fresh food here is also pretty tasty.<//text>

A place to find inexpensive items, not found in most stores. Clean, Fast, and friendly staff. Being close to home helps to stop in and get out.</Review>

<text>I went to this WalMart because I saw on the Walmart Website that a particular tv was available here and for a certain price. When I get there, the tv was priced $100 more. When I asked for help, it took 15 minutes for someone to answer my question about that. Eventually led me to the manager, I showed her WalMart website, the price and that it showed in stock there. She started giving me attitude for no reason at all and refused to help me any further. I walked out really upset. I forgot the managers name or I would name her on here. I'll never shop at Walmart again.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808565bee1a59bad:0x7fd8bab7c785af69</gmapID></record>

While the employees were very nice, from the observation of many Walmart's I have been in this Walmart seems that it needs to be better organized to match the vast majority. As you visit Walmart's there is a set up theme that builds a level of familiarity and comfort for customers. Aisles are also very narrow.< /Text>

Good Walmart! It seemed like a a newer store. The carts are not located properly, they are not present where they usually go. The home office/copy paper aisle is not organized or restocked properly. I had trouble finding them initially- One of the staff simply replied “I DONT KNOW” when asked where can I locate copy paper. I felt not welcoming.<//Text>

Lots of parking and right off of the freeway.  There is a Home Depot next door too.  This WalMart was clean and the staff were very nice.  Of course no matter which WalMart you visit there will be crack heads and hoodrats lol< /Text>

This Walmart has come a long ways of the days when their cosmetic lady, who rocked one large unsanitary dreadlock, was the go to person for hygiene needs. Despite it being on the smaller side in comparison to other Walmart's nearby,  Its product line has become more consistent and despite this location not showing up for online pick up curbside available, for the community it serves, parallel to Pittsburg's one high school concept. Its keeps everyone close nit and flows with togetherness. Prices remain decent and at the same time teaching us just because it ends in ".97" doesn't mean its cheaper but 97 cent is less the a dollar! Shoot out to my ol' class mate the night store manager. Happier employees make a happier experience  for the customers< /Text>

<Review>Trying to find out what’s actually available IN THE STORE on website is horrible. Can only search one store, one item then have to re-apply filters.
But even WORSE! I tried calling the local store to verify stock. Several times. They let the phone ring for several rings, then they hang up.

Good Job Martinez Walmart manager!

Nice good selection of clothes and clean store.
I was disappointed It was Thursday went to pay bills to donate money through
Western union. There were closed when the sign clearly said it should be open. Waited for someone to come but after 30 mints decided to shop and leave.
They should be 2nd person
If one goes on lunch break.
2 other people behind me had same issue. Hopefully
It doesn't happen again will try next week again.<//review>

The employees of this place need to know about the product they are selling no one seems to know the background of anything what it can do or does do and you don't have enough clerks to support the people. It's all for making money and not for service. The quality of merchandise is not the greatest and they only have stuff that seems like you never need it needs revamping and training of the employees< /Text>

A disproportionate amount of the mens clothing is under lock and key. If you want to waste your time waiting for an associate to unlock, retrieve, and repack each item into a security box then go ahead. I waited for 25 minutes. I will never shop at Walmart again. Disgusting that people allow these corporations to treat us like this.< /Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Usually a pretty good place to shop. I was just a little disappointed in the holiday decorations, or lack of. They didn't really have as big a selection of ornaments, lights, etc. as I would have expected them to have. They had quite a variety of Santa hats, and fake trees. But the selection of Christmas lights and ornaments was pretty slim. Otherwise checkout is relatively fast, even for the holidays, big selection of other products, and they even had plenty of paper towels considering most of the stores are out because of Covid.</review>< date>

< Review>
I'm writing a one star review to complain about this one transaction and the answer I received from the Walmart employee that was suppose to be assisting me.
I downloaded the walmart app and started adding items to my cart. At checkout I got offered free delivery or in store pick up. I didnt want to wait 2 days for delivery and since I'm going to the store anyways might as well shop around for other stuff.
Long story short I ordered water wipes for my new born on the app( cost $12.32)
While in the store I saw the price tag for the same wipes was $14 ish. I figured ill ask an associate for assistance to adjust the price. At the self checkout the associate told me that I have to pay the $14 or I can just order this online and pick it up once its ready. I told him this is literally false advertising. I understand the cheap online prices were meant to counter Amazon prices, but I think you still want to encourage your customers to walk the aisles and eventually make additional purchases.
I shop walmart for the instore experience. By trying to capture more online sales, you are pushing old school shoppers towards the web and eventualy Amazon.< /Review>

<Review>I was looking for a vegetable steamer, went to the section I thought it would be and didn't find it. So I asked an employee, they said they didn't have it and offered nothing else. As I was leaving the store I asked another employee, I believe his name is Richard. Looked like he was busy with something else however he took a moment and looked the item up on a device that he had and walked me too the same area I was at and said they had 3 in stock. They had none. I was pleased with his service, not so much with the other employee and their inventory system. Good job Richard.< /Review>< username>

20 plus people in line for customer service, no one in the money department for the normal business hours. Associate would not page or call a manager to help me in money center. Made me wait at customer service. I explained that the money center closes soon and I don't want to miss it, lady said just wait in the main line. Of course this line took 40 plus minutes to get through, and lone behold, money center closed and would not help me. Has to be the worst managed store for walmarts I have been too. This is not the only instance this has happened. No one ever properly assigned to the money center.</review>

<review>None of the employees seemed to want to be at work. The items I wished to purchase were priced wrong. There were so many boxes in the isles, i could barely get through with my cart. The employee scanners were not matching the register prices. And the absolute frustrating incident was the cashier asking me to go and get the same item I intended on purchasing because it did not have a label on it. I will NEVER go back to this walmart on Arnold drive!< /review>< Pictures>

For a Walmart store they didn't have a very big selection honestly. And there were more than a few things they had for sale that cost more than at other stores, which is very unlike Walmart.</Text>

The workers that work over there are not very helpful
Some of them say they don't know
Now they have numbered the isles
Some workers at stores say no even without investigating
Though no doubt I shop over and I like Wal-Mart but workers aren't always helpful</text>

The returns line was very long (out the door), but the staff was all very friendly and allowed me to come back to the counter when I find my item to exchange.  The store had a good selection for the small size (compared to a super Walmart)  and seemed to be fairly well-stocked. (Some items were sold out in the coffee maker section).<//Text>

<Review>The employees hardly answer the phone and then when they do, they don’t make any effort to see if they have anything in stock. Three times They hung up on me during mid sentence. I asked if they had something in stock and when the employee couldn’t hear me correctly, they just hung up. I called again and told the employee that maybe our call was probably disconnected (even though I know it wasn’t) but she ended up hanging up again. It’s really frustrating and the customer service overall is horrible< /Review></record>

Twice now I have ordered something online that states on the website it is in stock at the store and both times they did not have the item I purchased. Every time I call to find out if they have it back in stocks Walmart hangs up on me! Im never able to get through, and no one in store ever has an answer for me. Really poorly managed IMO.</review>

9 disabled parking spaces up front is good. 1 electric cart for the entire store is completely unacceptable. I feel like I'm being discriminated against. I turned around and left the store without shopping and I will never be back here again.<//Text>

Too many people that weren't social distancing (not from the same family groups) and too many little kids out of the control of their parents. Just because your family thinks you're adorable doesn't mean the rest of the world agrees!</Review>

<review>It was clean but I don't like the fact that Walmart employees do not speak to customers.  If I walk down an aisle you're working on and I pass you, a simple "Hello...are you finding everything ok?" is in order. I also don't like having to wait for an associate to open the glass to get my toiletries. This is ridiculous to say the least!!! I will be ordering mostly from Amazon from now on!!!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I went there to pick up a couple items they did have a line but we're allowing people in four at a time. Everything was well stocked. The lines moved quickly. Despite all that is going on I was very impressed.< /review>

This Walmart the employees don’t know where anything is . They don’t answer the phone I have been calling several times to speak to a manger they let the phone ring and hang up . Very unprofessional and disrespectful. Furthermore my wife and I went today and a lot of the employees have their masks under their nose during a pandemic where thousands are dying . I took pictures of everyone and will be sending them to the health department to let them know .!
Covid is not being taken seriously at this location. My wife has a bad heart and shouldn’t have to worry because employees are not following state guidelines.
Maybe Walmart should be fined and they will comply</Text>

I must admit I don't go to Walmart all that often, when I have gone to Walmart, and when I go to Walmart. This is the location that I go to. Not real convenient for me to get here, it's at least a 20 minute drive from where I live. They have great prices.< /Review>

The value was good however the customer service was awful. My cashier demonstrated two speeds: slow and extremely slow. Sloth like. Lastly, it was very warm inside,and I observed people NOT wearing masks. I'll think twice before going back to this Walmart.</Review>

< Review>
This rate has been given because I was waiting for more than 25 minutes for someone to assist in the jewelery department. After all that waiting someone was able to assist. Then after I had to go in line in a specific register so I can check out!!!
This was totally absurd.
I hope they can keep up with their departments and customer service.</Review>

Still just Wal-mart, less expensive stuff and unhappy employees.  Have to weigh out the affordable items and unable to ask for help from someone who doesn't really want to help</Review>

Customer service sucks. Returned 2 tvs totaling $289.00. One had a broken screen, the other hdmi socket was bad. Returned merchandise and was it supposed to be credited back to my card. It's been 2 days now and nothing has posted to my account.<//review>

I wouldn't mind too much except that he kept walking right up next to me to stock shelves. When I pointed out to him that masks are required in the store he said, "Whatever. It is what it is." So I promptly told him what I thought of him. Also there are too many cust and no social distancing is possible.< /Review>< name>

<Date>1597593088761< /Date><Text>I took my daughter for a little summer/back to school shopping.  We purchased multiple items in various sizes because the fitting rooms are closed.  When I tried to return the clothing items that didn't fit, I was told I could not return clothing.  I was given no date that I could return the clothing or another option to return via mail.  I find it irritating that Walmart did not inform us of this by posting signs or some advising us BEFORE we purchased.  Someone has filed a class action lawsuit claiming this is unfair to pause clothing returns during this difficult financial time. I found links in the article about the suit how to return items purchased in store.  The employees are ill informed or don't care to share this information with me at the return counter.  Shame on Walmart to make people keep items rather than be good company and steal/hold hostage people's money. One positive note, my daughter liked her purchases.<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp><user_name>Mary Cole</user_name><rating>2< /rating>< UserId.>

This is my goto walmart in my area being I don't really care for the one by my house in Pittsburg. But today when I went they had ALL THE COSMETICS LOCKED UP, it was a little over kill. I had to call and wait for someone just to get an eyebrow pencil. Not to mention I probably would of spent a lot more money in that department if I could of just thrown things in my cart. I was disappointed that this is how they have it now. At least in Pittsburg the cosmetics is a separate department that you can walk into.< /text>

Employees told me to go to the back of the store and that was the pickup area. The lady handled the order very well. I headed to the front door to be stopped by the guard because I didn't have proper exit papers. The gathered employees decided to call the lady from the back to vouch for me. She came, vouched and finally I was freed so I could leave. Will I use pick-up again?</Text>< resp>

All cosmetics are now behind locked doors, which is super annoying when you're just trying to get one nail polish and check out. After they get the cosmetic out of the locked cabinet for you they put it in another locked box that you have to carry to check out.< /Text>

I came to this Walmart on a Sunday for returns and Tiffany at customer service was so friendly and helpful. During the height of Corona frenzy, this location was well-stocked, aisles were clean, and staff were all very cheerful despite the stressful times. I am very impressed by this particular store. Even the optometry department staff are really nice!<//text>

This place is by far the worst shopping experience I've ever had I've literally been there twice and the second time was worst than the 1st which I didnt think was possible. I went back hoping the experience the first time was a fluke. I cannot stand it when any person of any background claims discrimination any time things don't go their way but I must say that the management at this store is somehow so unprofessional and couldnt care less for the customers and both times I've had them make extremely and deeply hurtful, offensive remarks and do things to intentionally humiliate me and others as well. Shame on these people .<//Review>

As per usual,  they say something is in stock online, and per usual it is not.
I should know better than to bother even thinking about Walmart for anything.
Customer service is obviously a thing of the past, so sad to see it die.< /text>

I don't believe I've given anyone five stars but the Wal-Mart in Martinez certainly deserves four stars. Some of the employees are actually helpful, and don't walk away when you're trying to get their attention.</Text>

You can always count on Walmart. They usually have what you need. I went to 2 auto part stores and the prices were high.  I ended up leaving there and going to Walmart. They had what I needed and they were less expensive.< /review>

<text>Walmart is as Walmart does. The front door staff is very friendly during this time of global pandemics. Things are fairly inexpensive. Sadly many of the workers there are not very helpful when you have a question. There is one guy in electronics however who is. He is friendly and knowledgeable. One thing that I really dislike about the store is that they removed the self price checkers and you have to wait to check a price. Then I was told by an employee that I could check on my phone. I did and the price was wrong which creates more of a delay. Still, the store is what it is.<//text>< user>

Walmart has the lowest prices car batteries, $54.85.  Unfortunately if your store does not have an auto service center you must stand the customer service return line to get a battery core refund $12+tax..<//Text>

The prices in Walmart have risen drastically. The shelves are not neat. Some items are difficult to find and staff is sparse so it is difficult to get help.</Text>

Went here last night (July 30,2020 at 8pm)to return my three furnitures that weights 300lbs or more.Rented a utility trailer at u-haul just to return all these furnitures(2 recliners & 70” tv stand).A stranger helped me out to put all these furniture to each walmart  trolley.Push them one by one at the entrance and to my surprise returns is already close.Spoke to a lady guard & male store staff,they won’t accept returns anymore because it was close an hour ago.Spoke to 2 managers named KIRSTEN & didn’t see the name of the other manager (Mexican lady with curly hair).I beg & beg to at least consider my returns but both of them didn’t offer some help.Both of them are very inconsiderate & inhumane.I know that even if they close the system they can do something to help me or at least offer to leave the furniture inside and make a note of it or endorse the return whoever comes in the morning so  when I come back in the morning they can easily do the return process.But both of them are in a rush to go home or lazy to do it.They did not consider how heavy it was the furniture,they didn’t care how i’ll bring back in these furniture in the utility trailer and carry back home by myself “that is extremely inhumane”.I was once a manager & I know that they can do something about it but refuse to do so & chose to be heartless in the middle of pandemic.<//text>

Honestly. if I could give 0 stars I would.
This all started when I tried to return a defective air mattress within 4 days of buying it. It would
Not hold air. Chris the coach. Not even a manager. calls me a fraud and a liar and kicked me out of his store. He was a bully towards me. All I wanted was a new one that worked.. he wouldn’t listen to me because he interrupted me every time I tried to talk and say I don’t understand why I can’t return it and why I have to exchange it. I was crying in their store because he treated me so horribly. What a bully.. I hope he gets fired. Wish google let me add videos for y’all to hear how he was treating me in front of my daughter.<//text>

I bought an item less than 30 days ago. Their website says that their exchange/returns policy without a receipt at 90days was ok.  I called to just double check that I can exchange for the same item, they shot me down..they need to be reading their return policy as very closely. I didn't want my money back, just an exchange..unbelievable.< /Review>

<Text>Plan on being there for awhile!! Long check out lines no matter when you are done shopping. They don't have any hand held baskets or mobility carts at this store. Regular carts are not always in front of the store.   Most of the time floor staff is not helpful at all. They don't always have things in stock or on the shelf.< /Text>< rating>

<Review>During these times most stores I have visited have signs posted letting customers know that mask are required.
I waited 20 minutes in line to be told I need I need  a mask to enter the store.
Please post signs so the public knows.
No all stores are requesting the public to wear a mask.< /Review>< pictures>

< review>
Okay two stars is not disliking Walmart. No stars is disliking Walmart. Two stars is tolerating Walmart. We all know what I'm talking about and we all know why we don't want to go there. When we go there we go there because we're forced to. We have to. It's never fun. Well...It's hardly fun. Mostly it's a drag but many things are and nevertheless you have to do them Walmart is a necessary evil. Two Stars is nothing to be ashamed of when basically you're the retail equivalent of the devil.</review>

This store is bias when it comes to customer service. Every time, I shop there, I get profile. There was no sign regarding buying 1 toilet paper (packagr) per customer. Another customer bought 2 toilet paper package and they let him off. I filed a complaint and they brushed it off. Never going there again.<//Review>

They have done some remodeling of the store, since I was last there. I didn't shop the whole store, but the men's clothing section, and shoe section have been expanded. The employees were friendly, pointed me in the right direction to find what I was looking for. The cashier bagged my groceries by category  so like items were together. She was to go on break after she was finished with me, but took another customer, who only had 4 items, before she took her break. The food section was as usual. Some empty shelves, and some items I was looking for weren't there. Overall, it was a good shopping experience.<//review><time>1574905198126</time><Response>None</Response><rate>4</rate></record>

Seems like Wal-Mart has no heart I have worked 13+ years have never gotten a promotion l can barely pay my rent.I have passed the manager test twice now I got sick and I am told that I can't use my 127 hours of sick time to cover my time off sick without it I can't pay my rent When I started my rent was 750$ now it's 1475$ I can't pay all off it this month with out my sick time to cover my time off.last year I hurt my back pulling water pallets and went to the doctor they. sed I have a compressed spine.I am not to lift more than 25 lbs but they still want me to The manager of the store sed if I get hurt on the job again that they are not responsible so l can't go on disability Does that sound right.Thay pay new hires the same or more than employees that have been working for years.thay say it is Wal-Mart policies from corporate office .My son worked with me 1 year he got sick and when I went to work he died I couldn't take off to take him to the hospital Every time I go to work L cry because he's not here The door greater get paid more than stockers and the truck unloaders They call greeters loss prevention now We have to pay for our own healthcare when I worked some other places they paid for it< /Text>

Why does it feel so ghettoish. The guy at the electronic was condescending. You can't open the packaging but its been opened and taped up.  Another guy was helpful in getting sonething really high on the shelf. Why do they put stuff so high in the first place? Found what i needed.< /text>

Horrible store that the very few times I've been in (just to send money) I was ashamed I had... Post incredible profits every year and can't even pay a living wage to its employees... I don't care how low their prices are I refuse to go there to buy anything... Please, go somewhere else...</text>

<review>Great place to shop. The prices are not always going to be the same as the website. You can order from the website and pick up at the store,thus getting the website prices. Watch for clearance tags. Clearance deals can be as low as 20% of original prices.</review>< user_name>

Friendly staff and employees. My go to store when I need something quick or at a reasonable price.  Sometimes I am there daily getting items I just realized I was out of. Lots of toys to choose from for the kids also.</Review>

I understand it was busy however, back to school time... So it wasn't really a problem, just a bit annoying.  Took about 15 minutes ti get what I was after.  It is a nice and clean store. The workers I've delt with are helpful and nice.</text><GmapID>0x808565bee1a59bad:0x7fd8bab7c785af69< /GmapID><Time>1566165963757</Time></record>

Waited in a long line to enter store to return one item . Turned away at the door because they had just closed the customer service desk. It was early and the rest of the store remained open. Won't buy anything else here.<//Review>

I would like to talk about an exceptional employee named Mary. She was working in self-checkout today. She went out of her way to assist me and has a great sense of humor! I believe she is the perfect person for the job!</Text>

<review>I went in for bananas because I've gotten them there before but I guess they don't sale much  produce anymore.  All I could see was a few tables with empty baskets except for some bags of lemons and potatoes.  I also couldn't find any rice cakes I asked an employee he pointed me to the grocery section but I didn't see them so I just want to Lucky down the street.   I've noticed a lot of homeless and people up to no good on the side parking lot so I had to worry about my car getting broken into the whole time.  Sad use to be a great place to shop.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<text>Went there to find something specific. I got to the section and the shelf was empty and items were put into the wrong spot. I thought the item I was looking for was out of atock, but it turns out someone put the item back wrong causing me to think the store was out of stock when it wasn't. I did find what I was looking for in the end,  but took a little longer than I wanted. Plus side the self checkout had no line and was perfect for my one it check out. Walmart please restock shelves and make sure items are in the correct spot.</text>< Gmap_id>

It was nice, I like the playing machines, it had lots of things. But, on the other hand, it was kind of expensive. Walmart is one of my favorite stores though.< /Review>

Went today to buy a vacuum.  Had to load it in the basket myself no clerks around to help.  Asked for help to load it in my car, cashier went out of her way to talk to the door check out man who said just look out in the lot for a basket man.  Got out in the lot and not a man in sight with the yellow vest on!  The vacuum cleaner box was heavy and ackward for me to pick up...twice at that!</text>

Cozy medium store. Great place to buy stuff on a budget, though most of those products, as you know, are junk, some others, well, just accessible to most pockets.
This is place is on a great location, you can get lost for you have to drive a few blocks into the neighborhood before you can see the store. People there are amicable, though needs much improvement customer service wise. This place has all you need from a Wal-Mart on a tiny scale, so, sometimes they run out of products – but they are very good at keeping a good stock of items.
What I like from this Walmart is their employees whom in my experience do not hide from you, the customer, and try their best to help you out.
This place, any ways, needs more people willing to organize this on 24/7, sometimes customers make a mess and stuff cannot keep up with it. Like other shopping places, avoid crowded times, save yourselves from a head ache and try to shop during the early morning hours.
A plus here, this is not in a ghetto town, so it is a much safer environment to shop. But always be on the guard for there had been instances of “bad people” trying to make bucks from others, so be careful and park on well lighted areas. There is security on the parking lot, but you know, there is always that day.
Better to go during the day, roads are super crowded during afternoon times.</Text>

This Walmart is need of some cosmetic upgrading. It for the most part is well stocked and service is average depending on department. For the area, it seems a bit run down but in all fairness, it pretty average.< /text>

This is a HECKA NICE Walmart. Not like that warzone in Pittsburg I usually go to. I like this plave. I like it a lot. Very busy still, but clean, newer, and solid employees.</text>

In a word. Horrible. Racks depleted of product. Worse than the Richmond store. These are by far the worse Walmarts I've ever seen.  They turned me into a "whatever else store there is besides Walmart" shopper. ...Jeezus weezus!!</Text>

<text>Walmart well it's a Walmart they're all pretty much the same this one is pretty quick when it comes to long lines as all the things that most Walmarts have. I recently bought a TV from there and it was a good deal. That's one thing about Walmart just a lot of good deals just about all the time<//text>< pictures>

Walmart well it's a Walmart they're all pretty much the same this one is pretty quick when it comes to long lines as all the things that most Walmarts have. I recently bought a TV from there and it was a good deal. That's one thing about Walmart just a lot of good deals just about all the time<//text>

We went to this place the other day to get a phone fixed, and we ended up with bows for presents, two floodlights, Fabuloso, and more. It is so convenient. They also have an assortment of fresh foods that you can get. They also sell clothes for all people, shoes, electronics, makeup, home decor, bikes even, toys, and a lot more. I highly recommend this place</Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< user>

<text>What to say about this location in Martinez dot-dot. It's really the most horrible at customer service in the whole store oh, but there is a light blond lady in customer service who is the exact opposite, and quite exceptional all by herself. I wish I could recall her name that she was smiling friendly and more than helpful at every opportunity and incidentally I came across her again and check cashing and she was just the same amount of pleasant Vibes and smiles. As for the rest of the staff oh, they seem to think everybody there is out to get over on them oh, they follow you around and make you feel somewhat like a criminal just because you were there for an extended. Of time shopping 2 hint hint people spend money. Forgive me if I have a little bit harder time than most because of a leg disability that my LinkedIn store does not indicate my intention to pay for my items. Aside from that it was rather clean from past experiences but I will comment on the fact that when you do need somebody to help you there's no one in sight to do so so work to be done still<//text><resp>None<//resp>< username>

Great place to go for your shopping needs. ( camping, family vacation, home maintenance, personal hygiene products, laundry etc... )If you need it they will most likely have it and if they don't home Depot is across the parking lot...<//Text>

The woman at the register at 4 o’clock on 1/31/19 made it seem like I was attempting to scam her. She asked me why I didn’t take the check to my bank, and a lot of their personal questions and finally she just refused to do it. It’s none of her business what I choose to do with my money and I didn’t appreciate her hassling me. I won’t be shopping at this location ever again.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Service has improved allot since my last visit. Now, if they treated their employees better I wouldn't feel so embarrassed for the store. Manager is a tyrant and Walgreens should be ashamed of their treatment of their workers.</review>

Where do I start with this place!! They often close early, the money order machine is often conveniently out of order in the mornings, sometimes they don't even answer their phones, and many of the employees are just generally rude. Walmart in Martinez overall sucks<//review>

Wish I could give 0 stars. It's filthy, isles are always blocked, and employees are never helpful. Always the most miserable experience ever. Avoid like the plague.</Text>

Good for cheap and mostly durable casual wear, basic recreational vehicle parts and accessories and sundry household goods. Some very good deals here and there, including in the grocery aisles, so it pays to take your time. Conveniently located across from Home Depot as well.</Text>

The parking lot is always full and inside the aisles pretty narrow.  Alright for quick stuff.  Try checking out through the garden section.  Usually not too busy.< /text>

Cheerful, nice salespeople. But very low inventory and nearly 20 min in line. Plenty of parking, though. Still easier getting in & out than Target.< /Text>

This Walmart has a wonderful Pharmacy Dept. They are conscientious, very courteous, and I felt, they really cared about my perscription needs. The head pharmacist is very professional as well as a compassionate individual.< /Review>

Worst customer service ever. Had to wait in the bike area for nearly 20 minutes for help. Other associates that walked by would just walk away when I tried to ask for help. The only bright spot was that the checkout cashier was friendly.< /Text>

No one is ever able to help you find stuff! Even the employees don’t know what they have in their store lol I asked three employees that where are the fabrics by yard? And all THREE said they don’t have any😂. But surprisingly I found them in the aisle with crafting stuff lol<//Text>

<Text>Aisles are not wide enough for 2 shopping carts and an employee loading shelves with inventory.  Sometimes it is really frustrating that it is so crowded in the store.  Parking can also be difficult.  But the prices are good.</Text>< response>

When I tried to talk to someone because I wasn't satisfied, I was told it was my fault, that i uploaded it wrong.<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Went at 7 when they opened to by pass any crowds a quick in and out I was wrong they had almost nothing I went for nun of the shelves were stocked my app and the store prices were different and only one checker with two people in line with three baskets full which was confusing seeing that the store had only been open for 15 - 20 minutes needless to say it was watsed time didn't have what I needed long long wait just to buy a few items walmart in Richmond as way better service always stocked and a better and more helpful staff very dissatisfied< /Review>

Every single time I go to Walmart for anything, they don't have what I came for!!

Last week I went for a simple vacuum belt. Guess what? They didn't have it.

Computer monitor?... Nope.

Kiddie pool in the summer time?... Out of stock.

A tube for boating?.. Hell no.

Life vests? ..Only if you're an XXXL person....

Vacuum bags???  -yes. But only for every vacuum except yours...

Picture frame? -Sure. But not any that will fit your photo...

These, amongst many others are things I went to buy and they did not have.<//review>

<review>Lack of a grocery section that had anything other than a few displays with some crappy looking fruit, and some freezer isles that were depressingly stocked, etc, etc.  However,  the person who assisted me in checkout was nothing short of an awesome human being, I give her the highest praise for working as hard as She does to make her customers happy.  She worked in the cigarette and alcohol checkout line the day I shopped. ... basically, this Wal-Mart needs a serious overhaul.  I don't recommend this location.<//review>< user_name>

<time>1544654917237< /time><review>The Holiday Rush is alive and well at this Wall Mart. The isle's were packed with people and merchandise. I think every check stand was open and people lined up. I got lucky and had a checker that had issues with the register, prices, reciept paper seemed like everything was causing her issues. She was nice and kept her cool though. The store was surprisingly clean and picked up, maybe because it was 1:30 - 2:00pm.
I found just about everything I went in for. Once I left I remembered about 5-6 more items I should have picked up,does that happen to you to?
Oh well have a Merry Christmas.<//review></record></dataset><record>

New manager has raised the bar. Clean store, shelves in order, friendly staff who inquire if you need assistance. I like the roving check out staff in the front. And of course, the prices can't be beat.<//Text>

Prices are good, but quality isn't the greatest. And watch out if your car ever gets hit in the parking lot. They have cameras, but when someone smashed my door in, while I was shopping, they were too lazy to check their camera footage.< /Text>

This is the 3rd color I started using and after a few months, they didn't have it in stock. *Sigh. Is red out of season now, because they only had a couple boxes of other reds. Not mine. Anyway, I bought just what I need from Amazon at a much better price. Sorry Wal Mart.<//Review></record>

Mid size Walmart, you own't find some things here, but I liked what I found, cheap large floor mates that would normally cost upwards $400 in a regular carpet store. I was able to buy 4 for far less than $400.< /Text>

No Stars for this store at all. 0 stars after hearing years of ugly disappointment, disapproval, remorse and grief.  I have only experienced this degree of rudeness and lack of concern during my visits to former communist Russia.

I've Been shopping Walmart for nearly 40 years and I have lived near this store for over 15 years. I agree with half of these reviews being the minimum of 1 star.

. Where people having money to spend are definitely envied and a target for abuse. If you want to be treated like a fool and a red headed step child, many years have proven that this is the place for you. Most my family and friends prefer to either pay more or travel twice as far to 2 other walmarts in very dangerous neighborhoods than to visit this Martinez store.

Why the management and workers are still in place, or why this can go on for so many years is just an absolute bewildering quirk to the American shopping experience and Sam Walton's credo.  They should just simply close this store.

And if your still reading this and expect the telephone service to be a work around, be forewarned. Time and repeated neighborhood stories have proven that you are not a paying customer, you are a pain in the neck that will be dealt with by a holding for 10 -15 minutes waiting for your privilege to speak to someone who will also not have a satisfying answer or treat you with respect.

Just shut this store down it's giving the Martinez area a black eye. Better yet drive a mile south and visit Target on Contra Costa blvd. But please close it's doors for good or give it a head to toe overhaul with comment cards being your guide.</Text>

Not a big fan of the Walmarts and went to take a TV back after a week because it didn't work and I still haven't been able to get it taken back. Because I didn't have my receipt but yeah I should have but usually Walmart will get around that but because it's a TV a cheap TV at that very cheap so cheap it didn't work< /review>

I can usually find just about everything on my shopping list here - packaged grocery food items, personal care luxuries, basic clothing for anyone, pet supplies, housecleaning supplies, gardening items and arts/crafts supplies too. I love the low prices and can even use clipped coupons to save even more.</Review>

I’d put 0 stars if I could because they don’t even deserve 1star. The customer service here is horrible. Super rude. Very unpleasant, don’t try to return anything here. Even with a receipt they told me no?? I wanted to exchange some ink I bought which was Unopened and just as I bought it perfect condition. I mistakenly got the wrong number and they First Lady said yes they can do that then the manager came to approve it and was so jaw dropping rude I couldn’t believe it. She was snatching stuff out of my hand and told me no we can’t do this. I don’t no what her problem was but she treated me as if I was doing something wrong. I spent almost $100 on that ink and I didn’t want my money back I just wanted the right ink. She acted as if I was taking something from her. I was blown away at how she treated me. So I calmly said ok no problem and I’ll go 2 a different Walmart. I’ve never been treated like that. She should be fired, I wish I had gotten her name. It was an older white lady with grey hair in a pony tail. Watch out for her she a witch. I hate this walmart.< /Text>

Worst Walmart. They are never available to help,
for the most part rude, and dirty. I asked the guy at self checkout to break a twenty for me and he very politely told me he couldn't but that the money center could so I went there and the woman very snottily told me that she has to call a manager to open a till. So I said okay...and she snapped at me saying she is not calling a manager to open the till. So I said okay thanks the costumer service here is awful. As I was walking away she looked at a women in the corner and states we don't sell money here.<//text>

Manager refuses returns from three weeks ago, even with the receipt. Rude and discourteous, he tried to day store policy wouldn't allow it without the original box so I showed him the store policy which didn't mention this and he still refused. Making up rules, not following their own policy.</review>

Most of the times I had exelent experience here. Today I founded everything but the cashier was to rude, probably feels tired. I think  people like her needs to work with products but not directly with clients.< /text>

<Text>No Stars for this store at all. 0 stars after hearing years of ugly disappointment, disapproval, remorse and grief.  I have only experienced this degree of rudeness and lack of concern during my visits to former communist Russia.

I've Been shopping Walmart for nearly 40 years and I have lived near this store for over 15 years. I agree with half of these reviews being the minimum of 1 star.

. Where people having money to spend are definitely envied and a target for abuse. If you want to be treated like a fool and a red headed step child, many years have proven that this is the place for you. Most my family and friends prefer to either pay more or travel twice as far to 2 other walmarts in very dangerous neighborhoods than to visit this Martinez store.

Why the management and workers are still in place, or why this can go on for so many years is just an absolute bewildering quirk to the American shopping experience and Sam Walton's credo.  They should just simply close this store.

And if your still reading this and expect the telephone service to be a work around, be forewarned. Time and repeated neighborhood stories have proven that you are not a paying customer, you are a pain in the neck that will be dealt with by a holding for 10 -15 minutes waiting for your privilege to speak to someone who will also not have a satisfying answer or treat you with respect.

Just shut this store down it's giving the Martinez area a black eye. Better yet drive a mile south and visit Target on Contra Costa blvd. But please close it's doors for good or give it a head to toe overhaul with comment cards being your guide.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

This Walmart is always so dirty, and employees are not very helpful or friendly.
The front row parking spaces in front of their building are always filled up by their own employees!!! Seriously? Shouldn't they have designated spaces for them to park?</Review>

<Review>Wal-Mart is a nice store. The parking lot has many empty spots to park at. There is a huge variety of products and many deals. The prices are low. They also have plants In the outdoor part of Wal-Mart. There is also this one section were you can get any movie for  $5!!! There is also many spots for self check out if you like self checkout. Recommend for all.<//Review></record>

<text>If you found something online and want to check if it's in stock, be prepared to call back 6, count 'em, 6 times before getting past hold and getting an answer. You could write a training manual on what a bad customer service experience is, during your time waiting on hold.< /text>< rate>

Sub mediocre at best. Steadily/rapidly declining store. Had orders set for pick up the Friday before Christmas, they said it wasn’t there. Came back the next day, they said it wasn’t there again. Contacted Walmart online and said the order had been delivered days ago. Now I have to wait until the Tuesday after Christmas to get my order which were gifts FOR Christmas because Walmart is closed. Thank you guys so much for the convenience.<//text>

I will give it 4 Stars because customer service is great. I could have given it 5 if they were to have sandler which they did not have nor any store near by including Ross and Target.</review>

<Text>Very crowded. Placement of items in center isle near last checkout is a mess. People in scooters and wheelchairs would have a very hard time getting around this area. Always conjested and backed up with the amount of people coming in and out of the area. The checkout line blocks access in that area. So people have to stand and wait to get in or out because of all the stuff put in the center isle along with people standing in line. There is never any sanitary wipes for the handles for the carts that are sticky it is always empty.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

This Walmart needs an overhaul. The grocery department is sorely lacking in anything fresh or organic. Limited choices. Not the place to shop for anything but junk food. Let's wake up walmart, the times are changing.< /Review>

A complaint I have with all Walmarts is the obscenely tiny isles.  This one is no exception. Parking here is somewhat annoying because of how they have the traffic flow and the people flow. But otherwise, it's a pretty decent Walmart.</review>

Hello it's Walmart the company isn't union they barely want to pay these guys for the work they due it's not only up to them how about we customers stop bring those bad a.. kids tearing up and down the aisles knocking and pulling and just making a mess in store buy it or leave it just stop making a mess of it and blaming the short staff . This store by far beats that huge Antioch store where every staff member is having a bad darn day and is rude, and by far the rudest of them all is Pittsburg I mean the staff there is the bottom of the barrel of nasty rude disrespectful and has no shame in being rude to there customers.  I wish I was a secret shopper would have fired at least five on the spot. I truly hate this Walmart  and was almost robbed poor lighting in parking lot stay away ladies at nite if by yourself. Dangerous area again poor lighting need lots of cameras and lighting outside. Yes Martinez store not perfect but they beat the others by miles . Now good finding that perfect Wal-Mart.< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Williams in the sporting section was very rude and disrespectful. 20 min to close I walked in to purchase  co2 cartridges and Williams told me he had no key to open the cabnet because they were with his drawer and they had already took it which also ment after being passed around from rude employee to employee I was not able to purchase my items there and had to be walked to the front to check out. I have had many issues with this person several times in the past month or so.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808565bee1a59bad:0x7fd8bab7c785af69<//gmapID></record>

OK really, who hasn't been to walmart? Even rich snobby people go here,  although they wouldn't admit it. They have good prices, a lot of variety, my only wish is that this was a super walmart.<//Review>

<Text>Great place to shop plus lots of ladies everywhere. Or guys for those ladies. Anyways don't expect customer service they don't do that. Great selection of automotives, home hardware. Toys they have but usually out of stock. Good selection of dvd's. Blu rays small section very little. 4k smaller but the ones you do find some are cheaper. Store is clean and is always busy but still you can get in and out depending on the day. Lighting is good. Wheel hair accesible yes. Outside and inside garden area is good size but there's always freight out there blcoking half the outside garden. But there's a home depot right in front of Wal-Mart to purchase your garden needs. Any other questions feel free to ASk. Oh yes they have a busy return area and also a money center for your needs.<//Text>< user_id>

Store is usually messy and dusty. Shelves have gaping holes where stock has run out. Unfortunately, not a Super Center, so very little produce and grocery (the candy section is bigger than the produce section and has about ten times the variety). Staff seems completely uninterested in offering actual customer service. There are a few employees that seem to enjoy working there and do try, but for the most part, I feel like I'm interrupting their employees-only social club if I ask for help. I get it - it's probably a crappy place to work and the employees probably have to deal with a lot of horrible, rude customers. I don't expect too much from any Walmart staff, but this particular location is a bit worse than many other Walmart locations I've been to.< /text>

They huff and puff when you ask where something was or would flat out ignore you and keep walking. Most of the shelves were bare and not stocked so pretty much out of everything. I hate having to go to this Wal-Mart and am probably just going to pay the higher prices at lucky or drive farther to a different Wal-Mart where the people are a little friendlier.<//text>< Rating>

<name>Molli Sonali< /name><Date>1399355278655</Date><rating>1</rating><Text>The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life! If you ever order from Walmart online, save yourself the hassle and pick it up from a different store! We found a boat cover online for a great deal so we decided to go into this Martinez Walmart to buy it. When we got there, they had the exact same boat cover on the shelves but they told us we could not receive the price listed online unless we submitted the order online. So we used their computer to place the order, and they told us it would just take a little while for it to go into the system because that is store policy. I kid you not, we ended up sitting there for an hour waiting. Finally we asked if our order was showing up on their system yet and they said that it would take several days to get into the system. They said the only way for us to be able to take home a boat cover today was if we bought another one at the regular in-store price right then and there. We ended up buying two boat cover that day!! But they assured us that we could go in and return it when the online ordered boat cover arrived. If that wasn't bad enough, things kept going downhill I went in to pick up the one I ordered online. My mom was the one who completed the online order but she was really sick so she sent me to pick it up because it was the last day before they were going to send the item back to the factory. She printed out the confirmation email that had all the order details saying to just bring in that paper to pick up the order from the store. When I got there, my order was sitting right there in the store but they could not give it to me because my first name is not my mother's name. I told them that my mom was sick and couldn't come in and that I could call her and she could confirm that she authorized me to pick up the boat cover. They said that's against policy and that she would have to come in or add my name to the order pick up online and it would take a week for my name to get into their system. I asked the associate for the steps to add my name online and she said she knew it was possible but she didn't know how to do it exactly. So she called her manager and the manager did not know how to do it either. If they do not know how to do it, then how do they expect customers to know?! Finally the manager told me he could hold it for a week longer, but he failed to take down my name, my order number, etc. IGNORANCE! The abundance of these kinds of ignorant people working for such a huge company have the potential of killing it's reputation and eventually even ruining the entire company! Anyways, save yourself a headache and go to a different Walmart even if it is a little further away.<//Text>< Pics>

Comparing this Walmart to the one I normally go to, this one was a bit out of place as I was expecting it to be a Superstore but it wasn't.  Still you do get some good selections but not that much variety.<//Text>

This store is the most poorly managed and poorly run place I have ever been in. I have been to this Martinez store location on several occasions to find products that are supposed to be in stock and on the shelf. On every occasion the store is out of stock on items that should have been on the shelf. Walmart Martinez and Walmart in general has a serious logistics problem. If you are counting on product being on the shelf just forget about Walmart and this store. Management is a disaster at this location and I think this is indicative of greater management problems at Walmart everywhere. I get depressed and frustrated when I am in Walmart - the reason I avoid this place as much as possible.<//text>

If you have time to travel to Pittsburg Walmart, Plz. Opt because we have experienced that there are.
More options available when compared to this store but here staff is very helpful n gentle.<//review>

This Walmart is usually pretty busy but what Walmart isn't?! There are a couple of things that I dislike about this place. #1 the parking lot is usually a nightmare. #2 the store is not as clean and well put together as I think it should be. Many times I see employees just wandering around without really doing anything while there are many items that seem to be out of place. Try not to go here unless I absolutely have to.< /text>

<text>I try to call ahead to make sure Walmart has the item I need.  Their call center (Martinez) is the
worse experience to go through.  I'm normally on hold for 15-20 Mins or get hung up on. I can
usually drive there and check myself before they come back to the phone......UGH
I was just on hold with the third person I got switched to after 10 mins he did come back. Surprise
surprise.

Always super packed.  Crowded parking (horrible parkers too) But it's a close Wal-Mart to my home, so I love it here. Prices are low (like all Wal-marts) and the place keeps pretty clean. Share's a parking lot with Home Depot, and a small strip of stores towards the back.

Bring your own Bags, or be prepared to pay for bags.  Contra Costa County is one of the few that has started enforcing the law.</review>

<time>1516248623425<//time><Text>I went to the customer service counter in Martinez to return some portable/ heaters radiator heaters. The experience was extremely Pleasant , very very quick and painless, unlike the Walmart customer service in Antioch. That customer service is horrid, horribly long, painful and absolutely ridiculous!!!  The service is never sufficient enough, the lines are always out the door as if they are giving something away for free. It's  just the opposite at the Martinez Wal-Mart.  I walked in there was only one gentleman ahead of me and the young lady helped him very quickly.  Then I was next, she dealt with me very quickly, very politely, and I was on my way out the door, which is exactly why I chose to go to this particular Walmart, so that I didn't have to suffer the agonizing death of waiting in line Forever at the Antioch Walmart not to mention possibly getting there only to find out that the customer service may be closed anyway.  So any which way you look at it don't ever return anything at the Antioch Walmart please choose another Walmart as your first option and the Martinez location was fabulous. And to just add it is always clean and they always have what you're looking for there always plenty stocked and they even have things that the Antioch and Pittsburg Walmart do not have.< /Text><name>MTJ4 ATT&J11<//name><Rate>5< /Rate>< Response>

Horrible service. Rude stockers, acting like I was a nuisance and in the way. One woman I see working is always sweet as can be, but the late night shift workers are always insanely rude. I wish I had another place to go after 9<//Text>

I'm all for helping the challenged people have jobs, but the clerk who finally appeared in Site to Store pickup was incompetent.

She had also told me that they couldn't fill the Pur water filter part of the order---but I found it on the shelf.

Then, probably at her manager's suggestion, decided to be helpful in getting the large screen TV (the first item of the order) to my car.  I guess you need to always deal with a manager out there.

Prices are ok but the problem is some associates are nosey and would love to inquire about a person's race or color,especially one Filipino lady at the customer service,I feel very uncomfortable when she ask what race I am and would love to ask questions that are none of her business.I hope Walmart will be more colorless.This is a racist store< /Review>

Laziest bunch of employees I have ever had the misfortune to experience! I went to exchange a pair of scrub pants for a bigger size, the return lady Dee was so rude and unhelpful. The night manager Taxianna refused to exchange the pants because the bar code wasn't onfile, even though I went back and found the exact brand and size. The employees are totally unprofessional and argumentative.</review>

It seems like every time I go there, their shelves are half stocked.  Sure, they carry what I need, just not today.  It's gotten so I'd rather go somewhere else, and pay a little more than to waste a trip to Walmart only to be disappointed because they're out of what I need.< /review><Date>1449471804464< /Date>< name>

Wal-Mart in Martinez really need to get there stuff together.  There were lines down the isles, and no employees to work the registers.   I wish that they could get it together.</Review>

<Time>1471480876367</Time><review>It's a Walmart. The people that work there are people.  They have this 'read the receipt' policy, similar to Fry's Electronics, but the people never actually look to see if that's what you have-- unless they think you look like a shoplifter. (I've seen them pull folks to the side) I think it's kinda lame to have a receipt policy, if you have no intention of actually doing what the policy is supposed to do. Otherwise, it's a typical Walmart.<//review>< user_id>

Generally a little cheaper than Target. Anyone complaining about customer service... this is Wal-Mart. I come here for their cheap diapers and $3 kids clothes, not customer service.</Text>

Generally a little cheaper than Target. Anyone complaining about customer service... this is Wal-Mart. I come here for their cheap diapers and $3 kids clothes, not customer service.</Review>

Some stuff on the shelves is broken so inspect it out before you pay for it. I bought one of those insulating mugs here and on checkout noticed the top cover was cracked.< /Text>

Place never has what I need. Even early in the morning the place is NOT well stocked. Seems the employees have time to socialize with each other but can't stock shelves or check customers out in a timely fashion. Must be the welfare to work group.< /Text>

So they have combined the lines for returns and banking...apparently they have cut back on hours for employee's at the expense of customer service.

Don't give the employee's a hard time as they are doing the best they can and are hard pressed to get everything done in a timely manner.

Just like Safeway on $5.00 Friday with only one person in the Delhi...lol<//review>

Deserves zero stars. The employees are NOT helpful and do the least amount of work possible to get by.
Don’t bother calling to ask if a product is in stock - the lady at customer service will just say no she won’t go look and then leave you on hold for the rest of the day.
I will never shop at this location again. And I hope that lady working customer service today gets fired because she’s everything that is wrong about the customer service field.

(Translated by Google) Because it has almost everything in one place, there are very few things that you cannot find, but the basics is EVERYTHING. Thank you very much Walmart.

<date>1535176482531<//date><review>(Translated by Google) All large supermarket chains adopt low-price management strategies. The difference between Wal-Mart is that it tries its best to save money in terms of purchase channels, distribution methods, marketing expenses, and administrative expenses. "As one" slogan, and strive to achieve the promise of cheaper prices than other companies. Strict purchasing attitude, perfect delivery system and advanced inventory management are the key factors for Wal-Mart to achieve the lowest cost and cheapest price. In the retail industry, a comfortable shopping environment and high-quality and thoughtful service are inevitably linked to higher prices; while in chain supermarkets with low commodity prices, customers often only get discounts on shopping prices, rather than high-quality products. service. K-Mart (K-Mart) is a well-known large discount chain store in the United States. It has a large number of stores. In order to save labor costs, there are few staff. Although the store displays a wide variety of low-priced goods, it is not easy for customers to find one or two clerk to ask questions. Here, although the customers satisfied their desire to buy cheap goods, they did not feel that the clerk paid little attention to them, so they regretted that they were not perfect.

所有的大型连锁超市都采取低价经营策略，沃尔玛与众不同之处在于，它想尽一切办法从进货渠道、分销方式以及营销费用、行政开支等各方面节省资金，提出了“天天平价、始终如一”的口号，并努力实现价格比其它商号更便宜的承诺。严谨的采购态度，完善的发货系统和先进的存货管理是促成沃尔玛做到成本最低、价格最便宜的关键因素。在零售业中，舒适的购物环境、优质周到的服务必然与较高的价格相联系；而在商品价格低廉的连锁超市中，顾客往往只能得到购物价格上的优惠，而无法享受到优质的服务。凯马特（K—Mart）是美国一间著名的大型折扣连锁店，它的卖场广大，为了节约人工成本，店员却很少。虽然店里陈列着品种繁多、价格便宜的商品，但顾客如想找一、两位店员询问有关问题却不是件容易的事。在这里，顾客虽然满足了购买便宜商品的欲望，但是没有感觉到店员对他们付出了一点点关心，于是在顾客心中就产生了美中不足的遗憾。</review><Gmap_id>0x808565bee1a59bad:0x7fd8bab7c785af69< /Gmap_id>< Rating>
