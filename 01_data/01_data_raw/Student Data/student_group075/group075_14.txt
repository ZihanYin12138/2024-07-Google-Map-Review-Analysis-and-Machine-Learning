Hello all!

The 722 Washington St location is only a temporary housing and services location, so what I am about to explain to you will give you a better perception of the organization as a whole. I came in intending to be an intern at the Turning Point Oakland sight which is a transitional housing sight for women; there is also one for men too.  At the time of acceptance, I did not need any help or housing for my internship. Closer to the scheduled date of starting, I found myself in a small crisis.  I reported this to the program manager the day she gave me a tour of the facility, and she-without any further questioning- recommended that I become a resident. Unfortunately for me, her boss (the Oakland program director) came to the same decision.  The thing they failed to tell me twice -once this time, and another coming up- is that if I had accepted emergency housing through their program, that I would be ineligible for any internship in their program! Further more, I was only at this particular house-as a resident then- for a few weeks, when they suggested move to the Youth Collective program in the San Jose area.  Their reasons were because I was commuting to San Jose for a job-that I did not end up staying with- and the other reason (hinted) is because I was young.  I did move to the program there and further got questioned by staff on whether or not I was intending to be an intern or just a resident.  Those who interrogated knew full well that I had been signed as a resident for both programs. Neither had I been read any options for both a compromise in housing and interning while this was going on.  At the beginning, I just had the HR Intern Program Supervisor constantly rewriting acceptance letters to accommodate me and my housing situation.  At the end, I was told that I was no longer eligible to be an intern. Also, there is so much inappropriate behavior that comes from the interns and staff just at the Turning Point and Youth Collective house, it's not even funny.  I have had to report them to HR and their directors for it.  Most of the residents at the houses that I've stayed at feel as though they have no voice. When something serious is reported, it eventually gets brushed off or not handled very well. Also, at the Turning Point house, they did not let the women or their kids go out claiming that it was a safe house (domestic violence) which a board member of CityTeam Oakland proved otherwise. Even the schedule the residents were made to follow (7am-10pm) was unreasonable.  The residents are people not robots need/deserve more freedom and respect. I do have other details that I did leave out. If you like any further information please feel free to contact me, or even comment on this review. By the way, this is detailed for a reason. I feel as though the public and any prospective residents, interns, or staff should know this.< /Text>

It’s a great place where the homeless community can get free food and shelter for a small price 365 days a year</review>

If you need a hot, free meal this is the place to go. They serve dinner only at 6:30. Make sure you go by 6:45 as they stop serving by 6:50. They also have a shelter for men although it's always at full capacity. The food is really good.< /text>

This soup kitchen serves 3 meals a day rain or shine. They dont push religion on you too bad either. This place saves lives every day. Strait up. I can't thank this organization enough for the work they do. A big percentage of the people who come here don't have any other resources. When covid hit the cityteam powered right through it. Mad love to this organization.<//Review>

So proud we have institutions like this in our neighborhood.  These people do great work serving and housing so many each day.  Volunteering there is a great way to feel the power of community and reinvigorate your soul, reminding it of the little acts your body can do to help restore the world.< /review>

<text>I was married here a few years back and had a bad experience. The man who performed the ceremony arrived an hour late.Ceremony was at my home and he told me he forgot it was at my home and was waiting for us at Chapel. Our guests and I had to wait an hour! And then he was rushing..making our special day feel like we were just a number. This past Saturday he married friends of ours and he was also rushing AND his cell phone was ringing during ceremony...couldn't turn it off!! He doesnt explain steps to couple.Photographer was rude.I would not recommend them. They need to be courteous,respectful and professional,which they were neither.</text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Skyrocket was persistent in pursuing me over the years, and I am so glad that they were. It took me a long time to be ready to make a change, but Kipp and the rest at Skyrocket made sure to check-in every 6 months to see if I was ready.
Once I was, they presented me with high quality positions from companies I never would have found on my own. Kipp was always available for a quick call and did a fantastic job during the negotiating process.
If you decide to answer a random recruiter in your email, choose Skyrocket.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Continue to pester you will calls every month/alternate month, no matter how many times you ask them not to call you. Moreover, every call they ask when should they give you a callback, and even if you say 6 months/1 yr, they don't respect it and call back the very next month. What's the point of even asking this question? Please stop spamming me.<//text>

They will not stop pestering me asking to write them a positive review on google maps. They just keep emailing me and emailing me over and over forever after I finished working with them. They send a specific template saying exactly what they want the review to say. It's ridiculous.</text>

<text>Skyrocket ventures are amazing sources for my job search.
The leads they have selected and provided are top quality. This all requires quite a bit of
good judgement and very good collaboration and communication to be provided to all the parties involved.
I Highly recommend it.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<review>I had a very positive experience with Skyrocket during my last job search. I was trying to relocate from Florida to California as a junior developer and I was having a very hard time landing interviews with the kinds of companies I was interested in. I touched base with a Skyrocket recruiter and wrote them off after not hearing anything for a few weeks, but they wound up coming through with exactly the kind of opportunity I was looking for. I ended up accepting an offer from a different company than the one they introduced me to, but I came out of it with a very high opinion of Skyrocket compared to other recruiting firms. (Shoutout to Kipp!) I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to job seekers.</review>< userid>

<Time>1610408303431</Time><pictures>None<//pictures><Text>I had a very positive experience working  with Kipp from SkyRocket Ventures during my job search and interview process. Kipp brings to the table a unique combination of speed and thoroughness which was very much appreciated. During the entire recruitment process, he always followed up very quickly and made sure every step in the process was well coordinated. Moreover, he always went the extra mile to give me a good understanding of what to expect in the interview, made sure my questions were answered and ensured I was getting the best possible experience during my interview process.

I would recommend Kipp and SkyRocket Ventures to job candidates who are passionate about working in a startup environment and want to actually create a long-term positive relationship with their future employer, rather than just ace a job interview. I will definitely work with SkyRocket Ventures for future opportunities if I have the chance.<//Text><response>None< /response></record>

I did not work extensively nor exclusively with Skyrocket, but in the time I did they did go the extra mile to understand exactly what type of opportunity I was looking for and presented me with some companies hiring to fit that criteria.  Although I ended up getting a job through other channels, I wouldn't hesitate to work with them again in getting help with finding new opportunities.< /text>

Unlike a lot of recruiters the opportunity that he presented was well matched to my skill set and sounded like a good fit.  He was very easy to work with and very communicative throughout the entire process.  I ended up getting a job that was a 50% raise with stock options over what I was currently making because of Jeff's negotiation skills.  I couldn't be more pleased with the process and would recommend him to anyone looking for a capable recruiter.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<text>They contacted me out of the blue. I wasn't looking at the time but it was literally my dream job so I jumped onboard. Their agent, Kipp, walked me through everything so it was easy. I especially appreciate that he worked with me after hours in his timezone since I was on the other side of the planet at the time.

I'm still working at the same place and am very happy here.< /text>< time>

He was really responsive and considered my feedback.</review><date>1578462898011<//date><rating>5</rating>< pics>

I had a very positive experience with Kipp as my recruiter. He will work tirelessly on your behalf coming up with many opportunities in the areas that fit your skill-set (mine happens to be computer vision algorithms). In addition, he has a very personable style that makes working with him very easy and pleasant. I highly recommend Kipp as a tech recruiter!< /Text>

I worked with Kipp during my job search in spring 2018. While the job offer that I accepted was not one that Kipp sourced, I'm thankful for the guidance and the time that Kipp gave me. Kipp's actions made me feel comfortable, and his values resonated with me.

I enjoyed our frank and direct discussions, and felt that Kipp was an effective communicator. I would definitely work with Kipp again.< /review>

I worked with Skyrocket Ventures to find my current job. Friend of mine recommended them to me and I appreciated every moment of working with Skyrocket.

I was introduced to multiple companies and was given both valuable information about each company as well as great advices.

It took me just a couple of weeks to find my new job.

With that being said, I find Skyrocket Ventures one of the best recruiting companies I've every worked with.< /text>

<text>Working with Kipp and his team at Skyrocket Ventures was great! Kipp sent me lots of relevant job opportunities with companies in the Bay Area. The cool part about working with Kipp is that he finds roles that match your background and interests. Because of this, you can usually skip straight to the technical phone screen, so I ended up being able to do a lot of tech phone interviews.< /text><userid>110172812244095015338</userid><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

They helped me find my current job about a year ago, and I am glad I joined the current company.  I still remember at the time I was not sure if I wanted to take the offer because I had another potential offer too, and also I was not sure which benefit package I should choose, they helped me a lot by going over the pros and cons, talked with them for hours to figure out what was the best, and I am really glad I listened to their advices.</Text>

<Review>Had absolutely awful experiences with them. They don't look out for you, pressuring you to accept positions you don't want to. The recruiter literally told me "we normally don't work with people like you, especially since you work at a large company, the only reason we're talking to you is because of the...good school you went to". What? What an awful, rude, backhanded, unprofessional comment to make! The way he talked about my school made it obvious he didn't know anything about my school (an east coast school) at all, he couldn't even name it! I'd spend hours on an assignment for a company I applied through them, and not hear back, ever. They are not respectful of your time at all. I think this entire company is a sham.<//Review><Name>miranda chen< /Name><date>1555769960273</date></record>

<Text>Skyrocket Ventures is one of the rare Recruiting Houses that is easy to work with, brings only qualified candidates to be reviewed and has the proven track record of locating the extremely skilled hard to find Engineers that I have needed.

When my team is looking for a person with depth in multiple rare skills, Skyrocket Ventures is my first stop.  Working with Skyrocket Ventures, we have hired 3 of these “Unicorns” over the past 4 years.  The team at Skyrocket has helped us fill many other positions with great Engineers.

Always a pleasure to work with Jeff and company at Skyrocket<//Text><UserId.>102622716973260715901</UserId.></record>

Skyrocket Ventures takes job hunting to the next level by really trying to understand my career aspirations and tailoring their suggestions accordingly. This is a big relief from some recruiting agencies that throw lists of company domains at me, some of which don't even fit my background, expecting me to filter accordingly. When I first worked with them 2+ years ago, Steve held an in-depth interview and combed through my resumé, and after a day or two came back with invaluable suggestions that helped me land my first job. I've worked with Kipp over the years and his energy and enthusiasm is amazing -- I felt he took great interest in finding me the perfect job. 100% recommended.</Text>

I worked with Jeff closely in scaling our startup from nothing. I wish we knew them sooner to save some time we wasted with other agencies. Their entire team was simply amazing to work with. They always provided top-notch candidates and made sure there is good fit for both the candidate and the company. The feedback from candidates who joined us was very positive as well.  I wouldn't hesitate a bit to use them again or recommend them to anyone.</Text>

<review>I've worked with many recruiters over the years, and while most seem to miss the mark, Skyrocket did an exceptional job. When I was looking for a new position, they put me in touch with two companies. The positions I interviewed for were a great match for my skill set. This is something that seems to be a challenge for many recruiters.
The second position I interviewed for was a great match and I took the job. I'm still employed in the position two years later.
I can understand that finding good employer/employee matches can be difficult. Skyrocket overcame this by doing a thorough interview with me first and listening when I described the kind of work I was looking for and the kind of company where I wanted to be employed.<//review>< pictures>

On DoorDash it says unavailable for pickup/delivery. Their website is running but it doesn’t show menu. They never answer the phone, not sure if their phone # is up to date since it rings for a long time then an invalid beep at the end. I can’t tell if they’re even open to take orders because there is never parking available where I can get out of my car to check.</review>

Courteous staff (some very generous) and good food. Love the barbecued meats! Prices are decent. I usually prefer take-out than dine-in, as the tables and the floor aren’t very clean. The only downside is that a few menu items are never available. : /   Also, it would be great if there are signs showing the dish names.</Review>

It was being soaked in a pool of that sauce at the store.  It wasn't good & didn't have much grilled flavor.  The Shanghai lumpias were half burned & half ok but couldn't really tell what was in the filling though.  Don't like sweet & sour sauce so did not use.</review>< Response>

Not impressed by the beef caldereta... its so full of meatless bones; you feel fooled buying yourself a portion of this... oh and they barely give you any napkins... how the heck am i supposed to eat this food if not with my hands? Not impressed... beef caldereta is more like a huge pile of tangy beef sauce with skimpy beef bones. It’s a meal for dogs. Goldilocks beef caldereta is way waaaay better! Other foods tasted ok... so disappointed though; don’t think i’d go out of my way to eat here again</Review>

Traditional Filipino cuisine served in large portions. Wide variety of food although their kare-kare is pork and not oxtail.
Reasonable price.< /Review>

If you want the pancit.you have to get there in the morning when it opens. Their food runs out fast. Pork adobo and rice, chicken on a stick, pork on a stick they also have breakfast there's so much to choose from you have to go family, friends, workmates all will enjoy have sit, stay awhile.</review>

<Text>...Just bought "120" uncooked chicken and pork skewers and they gave us ONE small container of sauce for basting the bbq while cooking.  Are you kidding me!!! it's like buying 20 piece chicken nuggets and getting one sauce!

Not sure if there's change of management but they did not use to be this GREEDY before! SHAME!  To think I'm always promoting your restaurant to everyone I talk to...

I know one customer means nothing to you but if you guys kept on being greedy, you will lose all your customers!  I also spoke to the manager over the phone to talk but she put me on hold and handed me over to another person because she said she needs to go home, she's off already...<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

It was so light and tasty.  Yum.   Also had a creme horn which was one of the best I've had.  The roll was light and crispy.  One end dipped in a rich chocolate.  Cream filling was light and not too sweet.  I could eat 100 of these a day.

If creme horn is not your thing, no worries.  They have croissants, muffins, a variety of mousses and many other bakery items.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Text>The food can be very good here, unfortunately it’s never fresh “sits in the warmer” and if you could find they’re delicious lumpias, it’s like hitting the lottery because they never have any. Sometimes the ladies working here or more occupied in their conversations then they are to serve you. Filam 1 in DC is way better...
At first I gave them three stars but now they are down to 2, The ladies here are slow take a long time in helping you out even if you’re the only person in the whole building<//Text>< Pictures>

Lately this place has lost its touch .. it was really good when they first opened . Sisig was on point before now they got lazy and just started using the BBQ skewers meat to make the sisig instead of using the original lechón style meat .< /review>

Their barbecue is probably their most popular dish, specially among filipinos and I would definitely recommend it as well. Food is always good and serving size isn't skimpy either. Would definitely recommend for a quick bite to eat to go or for lunch as it comes with hefty servings, quality tasting food for an extremely fair price for it's location.</text><Name>Rezzo Calamucha<//Name>< resp>

The BBQ skewers are delicious, you need to get some every time you go. The beef stew is my favorite. The ladies behind the counter are kind of rude, and they only accept cash. But the food is worth it. Go early cause they easily run out of the good stuff.</Review>

The daly city one is 10x better. My food was cold and I had to tug a war with the lady for some hot sauce. Needs better customer service.The soy sauce was leaking and I didn't even open it. Other than that still a bang for your buck cant complain too much.< /Review>

<Review>Affordable and filling. I live right above the restaurant and I often grab the two items+rice before heading to work in the morning. I tend to get the garlic rice with sausage or adobo if they have it and then a chicken skewer as my second item. The fried eggs are extra but hardly make a dent. Keep in mind they usually stop selling fried eggs after 11am. Their item selections aren't too unpredictable and feel free to call them, too! On very special days they'll have lechon!

Lines can get long during normal eating hours. I suggest you come on off hours as everything will die down and the food is fresh during these times.

CASH ONLY!!! But there is an ATM inside.</Review>< Resp>

Affordable fast eats.  I prefer the chicken skewers over the pork skewers; the pork ones tend to be chewier and fattier.  Roselle is the friendliest of the servers.</text>

<Text>They were out of lumpia at early afternoon. The woman told me to come earlier next time. How arrogant! They're blaming the customer for coming later because they couldn't deliver what's on the menu. Food looks unfresh! The carinderia style service has got to go! Patrons need freshly-cooked Filipino food. It should be cooked to order, just like other ethnic take-out places.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I don't think they cook any food here. I could be wrong, but it doesn't have the same smell as the original Fil-Am. Regardless, the food is still good. Love getting BBQ skewers with the pancit. Or just getting a container of various items.</Text>< rating>

BBQ skewers are the best here chicken and pork. I love their lumpia too but too bad they are always sold out by the time I get to them. Super cheap local eats, only if they had lumpia stocked more would I go there more often.< /Text>

Why three stars ? Well I think there is a place for places like this. The concept isn't bad.  Filipino food cafeteria style and IMHO they do know the recipes and are authentic albeit the not so good for you and refined way. My biggest gripe with them isn't authenticity or flavor  it is they over salt ... If they didn't this  place wouldn't be half bad and if you have never been to the Philippines does give you a feel for the community when you observe the people who work there or the style of food<//Text>

<review>Came here to eat brunch with the family. Big space. Went for the longsilog, which is 2 pieces of longanisa, 2 eggs over easy, and 2 scoops of garlic rice for $6. Not mind-blowing, but for what you pay for, it's good. I'll come back here to try their other items eventually.< /review><Gmap_id>0x808f79af31968757:0x88b35fa540383c36< /Gmap_id><pics>None<//pics><rate>4</rate><response>None<//response><name>Marlon Evangelista</name></record></dataset><record>

<Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><Review>Food tastes different each time.  Sometimes they're really good, and other times no matter how much lemon or pepper you add on the pancit, you're better off throwing them away.  I guess some chefs are better than others.

Also, amount of food you get depends on who's serving you except lately (past 3 visits) it seems to be so much less.  Costs are the same but just 2 months ago, they're large pancit would've fed 5.  Now, you can only feed 3.5.  You also have to beg for lemons which they give you just two small slices.  The large bistek used to be overflowing that they had to cover it with Saran Wrap instead of the lid.  Now, it's way below the top, and they're using actual lids.

So, before, I used to tip a lot.  Now, I don't.

Update:  noodles were super hard still, so, I had to put the pancit back on the pan, pour some chicken broth and add seasonings so they can be eaten.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

This location was great. Both Kyle and Grant did a great job of getting our "special needs" vehicle brought back up to factory specs. Master Tech Derick went above and beyond by being extremely thorough putting the finishing touches, repairing, and aligning a 26 year Camry after a complete suspension upgrade.

I'm really impressed with the way this team conducted themselves. They are real pros. I wouldn't hesitate going back again.< /Review>

< Review>
I booked an appointment online for an oil change. However the price that I saw online and the price that I was quoted in store were two different prices. However Grant and Gary really understood where I was coming from after I explained how the website is misleading and went above and beyond to help me.  They really did care to make sure I was completely satisfied, I recommend them, but please make sure you get a quote before you come in the door just to make sure you’re on the same page. Thanks again Grant and Gary for helping me out!</Review>

Our luggage was stuck in a Lyft drivers jammed trunk. We went to three car dealers - none would help. Bought hardware to try to get in at WalMart - didn’t work. Finally tried Pep Boys. The wonderful mechanics did not stop until the trunk was open. Unfortunately we miss our flight, have incurred a fee of $3000 to rebook. However, I felt the need to send huge kuddos and thanks to the Encinitas’s mechanics. Thank you!<//review>

<gmap_id>0x80dc0b8ea569582b:0x46638bdb4bdca9af</gmap_id><Text>Horrible Customer Service, I left my car with them before I went on a 3 day work trip. Needed them to change the oil, rotate the tire and fix a flat. They called and told me I had a blown head gasket, so I asked if the coolant was low because it wasn't leaking any oil. The worker told me they would have to call me back the next day because they did not check. I called them back the next day after not hearing from them, and they refused to do any work on the car, that included fixing the flat tire. They started yelling at me to come pick up the car. So i had to calm the employee down, which was weird.
When i got back from my trip, I drove the car home with the flat as they wouldn't even put air in it. Then proceeded to replace the oil, which was fine. No blown head gasket, it was as i explained to the guys that work on cars regularly, if they pulled the dip stick they would have seen the oil was fine. It was low on oil, which caused condensation to form on the oil cap and when the oil hit the cap, it mixed the oil. so at the oil cap it looked milky. This was confirmed later by someone else, looking at the vehicle.

So I would suggest taking the car somewhere else.< /Text></record>

0 stars! I made an appointment online. Upon my arrival, I was told their online booking system does not work properly. They scheduled me for an appointment later in the week and assured me I would be taken care of then, they even added a note re the issue with the online booking.

When arriving for my appointment later in the week I was told they were behind and absolutely could not fit me in. They said they had tried to call but apparently had the wrong number.

I will not be returning for another “cancelled” appointment! Get it together, Pep Boys!<//text>

John is a TOOL! after 3 days of trying to schedule appointments online.. which clearly state the times that are available.... they called me back twice to reschedule.. I came in at the appropriate time when i was told they could get to my fast oil change i needed,  John had NO idea what was going on even though Cliff told me i could come in and have it done.  I had to leave work early to try to get my simple little oil change done. and now all they could tell me is that they would have to leave it for a day,... FOR AN OIL CHANGE?!!!!! This place sucks.<//text>

Wife's auto battery died suddenly.  We jump-started it and took it to Pep Boys down the road.  (This was on a federal holiday (MLK Day).)

I asked if a new battery could be installed in an hour, the gentleman said yes:  in an hour the auto was ready to be driven back home (and wife and I had a good lunch!).  Pep Boys Gentleman was courteous and helpful.  It's just an auto battery, but based on this experience, we are very pleased.</review>

<text>Tom in service is horrible!!!!!!!  Horrible person!!!! Our family broke down in the rain had a tow truck tell us to go to pep boys 45 minutes before closing after a jump start.  We needed to have our battery checked before the long drive home. The guy said sorry we don't have time.  I said are you kidding... it's raining... I have young kids and I don't want to break down again!?!?   He said no sorry.  I then said so obviously you don't care about a family breaking down in the rain if our battery is bad.  He says you have triple a don't you!?!? Talk about horrible customer service.  Andrew in the main department was great and tried to be helpful.  He was literally the only one that cared and profusely apologized.  He was helping 3 customers at once and everyone else was not wanting to help.  It was ridiculous!!!< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>The employees all seemed very nice, but they told me that I absolutely needed to get new brakes and new tires because they were in the red... I was skeptical as I had just gone to the dealer only a few months before and they had not mentioned it.

I then drove HALFWAY across the country and got the brakes and tires checked when I arrived at my destination (by 3 different auto shops), only to find that they were in fine shape. I concluded that Pep Boys tried to rip me off as I was driving to a different state, which shows poor integrity and makes me distrust them greatly.< /Review><Response>{'time': 1416596744146, 'text': 'We regret to hear about your experience at one of our stores and would like to know more about your visit.

<rating>1< /rating><Review>My breaks were squealing so loud so I took my car in to Pep Boys in Escondido.  After 2 hours, the manager in charge called me and said my rotors were warped and my break pads were destroyed due to the rotors. They were quoting me at 600. Since I couldn't swing that amout, I bought the parts and had my Dad replace everything for me.
My rotors were fine no warping AT ALL, my breaks had about 75% life left on each side. I was so angry because I would take both my cars there. God knows what else they charged me for that didn't need replacing.
I returned the break pads and rotors and demanded my money back.  The best the regional mgr offered me was to just deal with him directly when I needed future service.
I will never go back there again!!! This place has workers that scam you, it make them look good if they detect and replace parts on cars.
Be aware,  check your car and make them show you why they think ANYTHING needs to be replaced!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>8 weeks ago we had over $600 worth of brake work done on my sons jeep. After calling around Pep Boys was not the cheapest but did have a $40 rebate once the work was done. If your expecting to ever get your rebate forget it. I have called & called and the same answer is always given "Its being processed".. Now the rebate line to call in is no longer. 9 weeks now and still NO rebate.. Beware of the Pep Boys rebates !!!!!!!

Do not get fooled by their offer of rebates once the work is done. It will NEVER come!!!!!

I'm back 10 weeks later I have received an e-mail saying they were processing my rebate BUT now it's only for $20.00 and NOT the $40.00 that they advertised. Also going to be another 2 to 4 weeks.

For those looking at Pep Boys to take advantage of their promotions buyer beware. It's the OLD bait and and switch. Bring them in under the pretense their getting a rebate then get nothing and if you complain they offer you half of what you are suppose to get.

DO NOT fall into the same trap I did !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//Review>< gmap_id>

I needed to replace my windshield wipers (which were a pain in the A$$ to remove). I went into the store and was immediately assisted by Andrew. He grabbed the correct wipers for my vehicle, I paid, and he installed them right away. He was very helpful and knowledgable. I was in and out with new wipers in 5 minutes.</Text>

I would give this place zero stars if it allowed me to.  I called and asked about their price matching, and they told me to bring in a printout from the competing store and said they would beat their price.  So, I took the printout into this store and dropped it off.  I received a call the next morning saying that they would not honor the price match after they had already told me they would honor it.  I have never heard of any business telling you they would do something, then turning around and changing their mind.  That is as bad as customer service gets.  I would not trust anything this store tells you, and would look elsewhere to do any business related to your car.  Not to mention, I had to go a long way out of my way so I could get the printout from the other store, which I did, since I was assured they would match the price.  When I told this to the person at Pep Boys, who was the one who dishonored the deal, which had already been made, he was completely uncaring and indifferent.  I even spoke to the store manager, who also did absolutely nothing about the situation.  I have never seen anything like this at any business.  I cannot stress enough to stay away from this store, particularly the service center.<//Text>

< review>
Just rating on simply two visits the past month for Encinitas since my old neighborhood favorite Pep Boys was in Clairemont.  I found the customer service lacking in both the service dept and cashier.  Not helpful at all. And the place wasn't even busy. However, a young guy inside the store did give me 5 star help finding something out of stock on the shelf, K&N filter cleaner then checked for a rebate item, STP fuel cleaner,  which he found out that the store stopped carrying.  Serve the customer with a good attitude and I'm sure it'll be the best auto store in town.< /review>

Usually find what I need and the staff is generally helpful and available. Sometimes you have to wait a few minutes for parts or at the cashier but the store is clean and parking is usually easy.< /review>

Similar to others...took my car in for an oil change and asked that they also try to find the source of a leak.  Had the car a day - I called to check on status and they told me they were having trouble with it and needed to keep it overnight.  They would get to it first thing.  Called the next day, mid-afternoon, asked me what the car was there for and it was obvious they hadn't even looked at it. I asked if they had done anything with it - no, was the answer.  Note, I had to call and check on it. I told them to hold off and went and picked it up and won't be going back.< /Review>

I have had multiple synthetic oil changes at this store and had them check and replace a battery. Every task has been handled well, even on short notice, and they have always gotten my car back to me in a very timely manner.< /review>

< review>
I scheduled a simple oil change online and showed up a little early for my appointment.  Pep Boys service department was obviously unprepared for my appointment time, but they assured me that my oil change would be complete within the hour.  I was very perturbed by the seemingly incompetent service department and ended up asking for my keys back after almost an hour of waiting for them to pull my car in to begin the oil change.  This was my first and last experience at Pep Boys; stay away from their service department.< /review>

<review>When I dropped off truck I asked them to service the rotors to machine them..but they told me the rotors were to thin and had cracks..I ordered new rotors and installed them myself..the old front brake rotors were not too thin and had no cracks...and then some other bs about contamination in my brake lines..I don't trust the service writers...but inside staff is friendly and helpful..< /review></record>

Tried to get a price & appointment for a brake job.  They said they'd call back.  After 45 minutes I called again and was told that they already told me they'd call back so wait a little longer.  Never called back, have to find another place for the brake job.</review>

I first saw OAN when I was in Eurasia.. They were saying things I knew weren't True and they were so Anti-American. I watch for hours as they would replay the samething over and over. I figured since I was so close to Ruassia it was a Russian propaganda network..
It seems so real, except I knew certain  things were wrong and not true. I still found it fascinating because they sound like they were American but it looked and felt funny. It is interesting after many years later they are now broadcasting here in America. This fake new. Listen and you will realize it is only them say what they are saying and that they will eventually say something you know just isn't true but they make it sound good.. Humm.... I wonder if I could get a job there.... It would be interesting and I bet they pay well too.< /text>

Great News And Travel channel. Professional crew, Modern and automated HDTV news studio complete with anchor desk, talk shows, etc, a very nice right leaning addition to all the left leaning major news networks ...
Very market minded and ultra competitive, great way to sell your luxury goods like real estate and yachts on their second travel and luxury channel... just contact them about getting exposure for your brand... very nice to have such an all around world class new media package all here in San Diego<//Review>

You report the news the way it's supposed to be reported.  Even during the  Peter Jennings era when they tried to keep the news unbiased you top even them!  Your commercials are educational.  You cover more information in 15 minutes than most news media cover in an hour.  You are straight to the point without all the 'personal opinions'.

Please keep it honest and fair.  You are so worth watching.
Thanks, Kate</text>

My  wife and I  have been watching your news since almost day one
we like how you just give the story with no bias or political motivation.
I would like to say to other people giving these reviews there's a difference between the people reporting the news and commentary, the news reported on this station is just that news . It's very refreshing to see the good work OAN does.<//Text>

This company hired her and then in less than three months was doing three jobs without being trained on two of the jobs they handed her. She then went to Finance/HR and spoke to them about concerns. In the same day that she went to HR she was fired for what she discussed. There is no HR and the hiring process is very unprofessional. Firing someone for what doing the right thing is so very unprofessional. Not to mention some of their ethics are very unprofessional and not ethically right. Stay away from this company and be careful what you are buying . Ask a lot of questions and understand what you are getting into.

Graham Ledger please educate yourself on the physiological facts of transgender persons.  These people are BORN with the physiological aspects of the gender they identify with, not necessarily the aspects of their genitalia.  Get your head out of your a__, please.  I tend to agree with most of your political opinions, but couldn't disagree with you more on the topic of transgender.  And how many transgender people do you actually know, personally?< /Review>

The best news, commentary and documentary shows around.  TRULY nice to see the segments regarding the US constitution and US history (NICE WORK).  May your teams broadcast audience continue to grow.  More people need to watch OANN for the truth.  The OANN team is collectively the best bar none.  If you ever need support, don't hesitate to contact me.

The Graham Ledger show is THE BEST news show on cable news!  This station SHOULD be available through EVERY CABLE PROVIDER - Many of my friends (I belong to a republican women's group) are contacting their cable providers, like Cox, Direct-TV to demand that this station be available to them.  I encourage anyone reading this that can only view One America News thru the internet to call your provider and demand that your provider carry this station!  Graham Ledger is terrific!  love this show -< /review>

<Review>The news is truthful and like the lack of commercials. My only problem is a few of the young reporters repeat themselves but hopefully experience and time will cure this. A nice change from the network and other cable news on tv. The breaks which are snippets of American history are excellent mini-history lessons.<//Review><time>1457931383400<//time><name>Belinda Phillips<//name><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

This is by far THE BEST news network you'll ever find. Forget all the other "news" networks - they don't even come close. So if you're tired of CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, FoxNews and all the rest of them - subscribe and watch real, professional, interesting, intriguing, informative news. Their programs are killers one after the other. And most of all - you'll never yawn at the screen when they are on it. I guarantee you.<//Review>

I appreciate that the channel hires young journalists, however, please give them some training.  Too many of the off camera reporters sound like high schoolers reading "what I did on summer vacation' reports.  I like the channel but the immature sounding reporters and lack of presentation skills  has become genuinely irritating.<//text>

<text>They omit relevant facts and make false statements to slant towards a mostly "Right Leaning" Viewpoint.  I don't mind hearing a "Right Wing" Point of View but Lying about Well Known Facts to mislead people does not make for a Well Informed Opinion if you don't want to be manipulated.  I will continue to only use this Network as a Biased Point of View source.  Anyone that Advertises on it should also be viewed as Suspicious like Ads on Fox News like Gold is actually a Good Investment.<//text>< pictures>

I love how all the liberals label this network a conservative network.  It goes to show how biased the media is, that any news channel that doesn't lean left is conservative.

It doesn't matter that it doesn't lean right either, must lean left to not be conservative!!!

Good network, real news, no biased</Text>

I find Graham ledger's commentary excellent and so germane––so veritas.  I've heard Liz Wheeler also make excellent comments. Their general news reporting is also well done and informative. I'll continue to watch OAN every evening!

This station is so much better than the network station news there is no comparison.  No fluff stories here.  No 15 minutes of advertising during a 30 minute news program.  No viagra adds.< /review>

<review>I really like OAN news as it is very fair and much less biased reporting the political news. All the others stations are very one sided, which i don't like.
OAN reports on more important world and domestic news. I like the fact it is family owned. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK. I will continue watching.</review><resp>None</resp><userid>107251080237942984967</userid></record>

Turn to FOX in the AM but few seconds later always switch to OAN where the news is ALWAYS presented in a clear, objective, and  succinct format, and NO commercials!!!!!  Congratulations OAN - you have the right formula for communicating news events and I am telling all my friends.</review>

<Review>First there were the Networks,after that Cable CNN etc. Then came FOX wich is becoming a mixed bag. Just recently we got OAN.This is the right way news should be . No bias, straight forward,what a welcome change.

<Review>Liz Wheeler & Graham Ledger are the best! They cut through any left wing nonsense with insight and call them out when the lefties try to change the subject.  As we all see, the Democratics l& Progessives can never answer a logical question. They have a habit of changing the subject because they have no answer.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>'OANN' - One America News Network is always realistic news, not fake news! We listen to much of it daily and their news casting helps us provide a relevant Facebook web page which we have nurtured daily for about 18 months. Our web page is titled "Californians For President Trump". Our weekly reader numbers are between 9,000 and 65,000 per week. Besides being pro-President Trump, we are also anti-Gov. Brown. ....OANN Also has very limited advertising which means they are not swayed by the money-pool! Thank you OANN for giving us a huge change from the Liberal Media!<//Text>< Pics>

Just saw an ad on OAN saying it provides "just the facts". But, I remember seeing a graphic on OAN about "the President's War on the Police". This is absurd... complete loss of credibility. Then, some OAN blonde says 'even rocks can tell Hillary Clinton is lying'. Sounds like a professional bimbo. Can she and her rocks tell when Trump is lying?< /text>

I took three vehicles to Sierra tire and wheel. New tires for one, oil changes on all three, and they found a cracked valve cover on one . They were able to repair it quickly and at an affordable price.  Chris and Ben were very professional, courteous and fast. It didn't cost me a fortune either. I will definitely be doing more business there.</review>

< review>
Incredible experience with Sierra Nevada Tire in Pollock Pines!

So last September, I took my truck in for an oil change and had them check the brakes. They asked me if there was anything wrong and I told them no, just that I've had the truck 10 years, driven 65,000 miles and have yet to replace the brakes. I get my truck after service and they say the brakes are fine. Probably 30-40% left, but still OK. I was pretty pleased that they didn't decide to just tell me I need new brakes and charge me ... I would have said fine and never known any different.

Now today, I had brought my little Honda Fit in because I heard some light grinding when the car was rolling - this was without the braked being used. I thought uh-oh I must be close to metal and metal and better get the brakes done before I've got to replace the rotors too (been there, done that in years past). So i get a call this morning from them telling me my brakes are fine, not need to replace them - but they did notice my tires needed to be rotated and did so. OK - i was fine with that. Also - again thinking they could have just replaced the brakes and charged me and I would have been happy.

So here's the kicker: When I sign the receipt - it says $0. I question the fellow - and he says "...brake inspections are free..." I then say, "but you rotated the tires...". He said - "well, I had them off anyway....just come see us when you need new tires...". You're damn right I will! In fact, that's where I'm taking both vehicles for all service. WOW - an HONEST car service place!!!! Had I gone to a dealership they would have charged me through the nose and probably found more things to "repair" and charge me for.

What an incredible experience. Sierra Nevada Tire gets all my business for now on! Thank you!!!<//review>

<Review>I had some car trouble driving from Sacramento to Tahoe, I was driving 30mph on the 50 til I was able I pull off and luckily found this place! Right when I got out of my car the man at the counter said I saw what was wrong right when you pulled up, pull up to the garage and we'll help you! They spent a good time under my hood thoroughly fixing what needed to be done! Very friendly and proficient! Thank you!!< /Review>< user_id>

< review>
My wife took her car in for a check engine light.  They said it would be 350 dollars to change plugs and wires.  The next day her car had a new noise and the car lost its serpentine belt.  I honestly believe they messed with her car, so we would have to bring it back so they could make more money.  Extremely disappointed.  Good thing we have AAA, she was broke down on hwy 50 with 3 kids.  DO NOT GO HERE!!!</review>

Didn't buy anything from them but a buddy and I stopped by and asked if we could air up our tires from a day of wheeling.  The gentleman said sure and he actually aired them up for us which we were not expecting him to do. Overall good experience with the staff here, If I hadn't just bought tires I would of considered taking my business there.  Would recommend!</review>

My guy wanted to get the ATV rim back to you in case you needed it. Since you weren't in the shop there was no other way to communicate this with you. Please contact us so we can discuss.

Ask for Edward!!! I’m a Salesman myself and I know a true salesman when I see one. Honest, upfront, and genuine. He let me know every detail to my understanding and added facts to back it up - and that’s something I respect the most. Amazing experience at Camacho and I will be referring anyone in need of a vehicle to Camacho Auto sales. Thank you so much  Edward -  you are prime example of an honest genuine salesman.</Review>

Mark was and is a wonderful professional patient salesman!  He did everything in his power to make sure I got a vehicle that my son and I were and are happy with!  Credit approval was immediately approved, and Marks loyalty and understanding is and was beyond what I expected.  God Bless you Mark.  And thank you for being so patient and helpful and alert and aware of my son's and my needs and wants.  Cheers to you Mark<//Text>

<name>Nobody Safe</name><Review>Hello I would like to thank Camacho and their Lancaster team especially MARK. We wanted to welcome our Newborn to a safe and reliable car. Mark was very Well-mannered individual who understood his customers DREAM and knew how to get them their dream car. I was very hesitant about my first approach because my last experience at a dealer. His urgent care for what his customers wanted/needed was surprising. You gentlemen work hard to get me in and out with my dream car w/ a Great deal. Thank you so much appreciate you help.

I went to Camacho last week for my first car with my mom. Since we didn’t know much about cars or the process of buying one, Isaac and Omar, the ones who helped us with the process, were informative, friendly, and patient with us. I’m glad they worked with us and were understanding of our situation and experience. The staff are very friendly and they help you a lot in making sure you are able to afford a car you happy with and can drive off with. We are grateful for all the help and enjoy the car.<//review>

I can't really give these guys an honest rating as I haven't been here since the late 90s when I was an 18 year old kid. However, when I was there I test drove a Ford prob, we drove it around the block and it broke down on the test drive. The salesman tried to blame everyone and everything except the junk car. Since this experience i have never bought a car from a dealership. No offense to camacho or any other dealership but dealers  just can't relate to a car like the original owner. Every car is a good car to them and every customer is a pay check. Thats why they are in business.
my suggestion is to buy a car the way i buy a car.. buy from private sellers negotiate fair deals  and most importantly bring an ASE certified mechanic with you. If the car is sound and the deal is right il pay 100 bucks for a diagnostic test so I know what I'm buying. This is a lot of work but out of all the cars I have bought only one didn't make it to 300,000 miles. That one was smashed in Las Vegas. For roughly 300 bucks you know what you are getting and to be honest dealerships will try to push some warranty which they know will likely never be used,  due to semantic for 5 times as much<//text>

<Text>I called ahead and talked to a women on the phone and she told me I was approved and this good stuff people like to hear, she was also super friendly so that helped. But when I went in it was a completely different story they are not very friendly here. They also have super high APR rates for old used cars they try to say it’s your credit and it really isn’t because I previously went to different dealer ships and was approved but didn’t like the vehicles so I chose this place and they are insane, want you to pay almost 2x the price for a used car. Compared to the regular dealer ship please check apr rates and the original price of the car if you go here and be sure to ask about an engine warranty they don’t have it listed in the car paper work anywhere and they usually have to disclose that they don’t, have in if it isn’t included. Almost pulled a fast one on me! Ended up leaving but keep getting notifications that they are still running my credit! Please be careful!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

When I came in to get a car on July 31,2020 I didn’t think I was going to leave Camacho Auto Car A lot with an 2017 Hyundai Elantra. Nathan and his Manager help me get my car. They helped me and took their time helping me. They are very friendly and the environment was nice. If you need a car Nathan and his team will definitely make sure you will leave their lot with a car.</text>

<text>I highly do NOT recommend this place. They are professional scam artists. I called this place, told them that I was only interested in a 4WD truck. She told me they had 3 in stock, so I made an appointment for the following day, & then drove 3 hours to get there. When I arrived, they immediately started in on the approval process, prior to even showing me any vehicles. I didn't think much of it at first, because I figured the trucks I was interested in had been noted. After being there for about an hour, he then asked me what type of vehicle I was interested in. I explained how I spoke to a representative the day before & told her which vehicles I was interested in. She told me they would be available to view at the Lancaster store when I arrived. The salesman told me that they didn't have any of those trucks any more, in fact they didn't have ANY trucks on the lot. The ones I inquired about had miraculously sold the night before. I should have followed my gut instinct & walked away. But they offered to show me some AWD vehicles, since I came looking for a 4WD truck. I test drove a Honda HR-V. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful car, but I'm wishing now that I would have just waited. He came back with the numbers & the offer sounded too good to pass up. I'm kicking myself in the butt for not paying more attention to the details when I signed the contract- but the final numbers I received from the bank today in my "Welcome Package" were higher than what he had told me at the dealership. Not to mention, prior to my phone interview with the bank, he called me to "coach" me on what I needed to say to the bank to make sure the interview goes well. This place seems very dishonest, and will do anything to make a quick buck. Don't make the same mistake I did, please avoid this place at all costs.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

The car was bought for my son the sales person being new had no knowledge of cars the sales , financing or contracts .... I told him i have insurance he added in another policy he never submitted my income to the bank for car loan and it was denied I later found out it caused negative report and the repeat requests caused my score to drop from 687 to 443 in order to except in house financing and take all other opinions available off the table .  the car had break and rotors issues that had be replace 2 day after purchased the mechanic found plastic bottle left under the hood melted on engine while doing a inspection for other issues all in all I will never purchase here again and plan to pay off early .< /Text>

I need a car ASAP and I didn’t have a lot to offer to buy a car. I’m a new mom donut was important that I got a car that was reliable and enough space. I had limited options but Daniel was able to help my family and I out. He really did everything to help me to get the best car for me at this moment. I look forward to working with him in the future. Thank you for everyone at Camachos who played a part in helping my family!< /Review>

Just came in  because a representative lady from camacho said I was pre approve sent me to camacho for a appointment manager not even here or maybe hiding in the back must be his way of dealing with unwanted customers. Sad to hood to be true sham on there lies to make you come in and waste both people time . Go somewhere else asap. Run. 🏃‍♂️ lanacadter Mexican manager makes my people look bad ..sad story. Waste of my time and theres..😠<//review>

They listen to exactly what I wanted and worked hard to get the deal that was what I was looking for big thanks to Al, Omar and Mark! They were amazing and I would definately do business with them again! I would highly recommend this place. They work with all kinds of credit cuz mine was very challenging and they still got me a really good deal!<//text>

Went with them because we wanted to support a local business and couldn't have been happier with that choice. Got a custom 14" circle logo for the side of our delivery vehicle and it looks fantastic. Definitely will turn heads! Thank you!!</review>

Love the colors and print quality! Fast print times and responsive customer support. The price calculator on website is awesome! Great print shop for someone with medium to high design skills. Will recommend to all my friends when they need print promotion. Thanks guys!</Review>

Wasn’t sure if I wanted to use PrintPapa for my print job, but after reaching and communicating with Nick I was convinced I had to. Superb customer service, and even though I had some issues he totally made up for it, and went above and beyond!  I highly recommend using them and with 100% satisfaction you can’t go wrong!< /Text>

<text>I needed a banner to let people know where they could get vaccinated.  I had only a faint idea what kind of banner I wanted.  The PrintPapa employees were there to help me to get the right size, the right material and the right color.  If anybody I knew asked me where to get a banner, I would send them straight to PrintPapa.<//text><Date>1622992850881<//Date>< pictures>

The web interface is very easy to use, does not require design expertise. When I called customer service related to a website issue, Shawn worked through it with me and I was able to place the order on my own within the hour. The final printed product met my expectations, will be ordering more.<//review>

< Review>
I had a problem with blurry dull business cards which I had made at vista print. I was never told what they needed to make a clear colorful card.

Nick from print papa walked me through the process and the result was a beautiful business
Card. In this day and age businesses are to quick to mass produce a product for a quick buck. In my opinion Print papa is a good company and I would highly recommend them.<//Review>

<text>The experience was great.  Mohamed, Sam, Nick and the team took the time to explain and help me understand along with guiding me to what I needed to do so that my end products turned out perfect.   I'm extremely happy and looking forward to doing more work with the team in the near future.

Thank you and keep up the great work!!!

<review>PrintPapa has the best customer service of any business I have every worked with! I am a long time customer and will always use them for my print projects because of their incredible communication, their easy order process, their quality products, and their flexibility when you are in a bind with timelines. They are a model company for how to work with customers and I continue to appreciate what a joy it is to work with them every time I place an order! Thank you PrintPapa!<//review><pics>None</pics>< Rating>

<text>Loved my experience with PrintPapa! I had a rush order that I set up in the store with the teams help. They were really helpful in selecting what stock to print on and get everything ready to go. I even had an issue with my proof but they were able to handle it right away. A week later I have all my printed items and they look perfect! I'm so happy with the results and the service. Will be back soon!</text>< Pics>

My Santa Clara office has been working with Print Papa for their local printing needs, and recommended them since they did a great job for them locally.

What an amazing print shop! Very good website, proofing system, and customer service. I ordered several banners for my boy scout troop and received them very quickly, with quick proofing and actual customer service at the store. Will definitely come to them again for any future printing needs.< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Shawn, After my original order with another vendor fell through I had less than two weeks to find another source for our labels. Some quick web searching yielded a couple of prospects of which PrintPapa was one. I was reluctant to "deal" with a website and under considerable pressure to make my deadline, I gave PrintPapa a call. I met Nick Rennie over the phone and he took a few minutes to get to know my project, he further explained the process at PrintPapa and gave me assurance that he would come through. I completed my purchase through the website and Nick was on the job. After a few days I received my ship notification and eventually received the labels. The order came in on time and flawless. Nick kept in contact with me through the process. Our event was a success and the labels for our one-of-a-kind Plum IPA were the showcase!! Strong Work PrintPapa!! Strong Work!

I’ve been using PrintPapa for my clients for almost a year and They are my go to online printer for many reasons including:

number of products, including many not available at competitor sites as well as a number of paper / material options.

Excellent customer service. You can reach a real human pretty easily.

Often have sales / specials.   that help control costs.

Most importantly, the quality is excellent.

PrintPapa is in my estimation. The best online printer in its class.</text>

We looked for a local printer and happened to find Print Papa. We have been super happy with the service and the product line. Our business cards came out beautifully even though our order was a small one.  We love the convenience of ordering online and then picking up in person. We will continue to use Print Papa for our business printing needs and have already recommended you!</text>

I received physical proofs first and discovered that the color was off for the one small graphic I had inserted on each one. I designed my own invitations through Canva and the color of the graphic was supposed to be royal blue, but it was purple when printed.

When I called Print Papa, Sam was very helpful. He talked to me about the issues with printing from Canva (as opposed to Photoshop) and worked with me to try different variations of blue. He told me to email him 3 different options so he could have more proofs printed for me (for an additional cost), and I complied. He promised me the proofs would be ready for pickup the following Monday - this was on a Friday. I emailed my selections within an hour after our phone conversation and felt confident that this could be resolved.

Monday came around and I had my fiancé head over to pick up the new proofs. When he arrived there, he was informed that the proofs hadn't been approved yet. My fiancé, unaware of the story, approved the old proofs with the purple graphic. As soon as I got wind of this a couple hours after he went, I called Print Papa and told them not to approve the purple proofs, since I had sent new proofs to be printed, and I informed them they were supposed to be ready for pickup that day.

Nick, the guy I spoke to, was unfriendly and did not listen. He was quick to protest that it was too late in the day to print off 100 copies of the invitation & materials. I had to repeat the story again. There had been no communication from Sam regarding the color issue, and my new proofs were not available that day. Nick said he would look into it and get back to me. His overall demeanor was rude and abrupt.

When he called me back a couple days later to let me know the proofs were ready, he was similarly unfriendly and acted as though this whole situation was an inconvenience. He also tried to charge me again for the proofs, but I had already paid. By this point, Sam had completely fallen off the radar and I guess hadn't been communicative at all with anyone else working there. Finally I got to the point where the proofs were available, on Wednesday. When I picked them up, it was just one large sheet of glossy paper with four variations of the invitation (including the original one) - not even an accurate proof sample of what my invitation would look like, but whatever. The color was better, so I fixed and re-uploaded my graphics on their website with the new, proper royal blue color and made sure to specify to them via message that these were new, updated invitations that needed to be printed.

I didn't bother asking for proofs again because I assumed the situation was resolved after approving the second round of proofs (which should have been enough), and my invitations were already going to be late by this point, almost two weeks after I had put in the first order.

At long last, the full suite of invitations & materials were ready, all 100 copies of them. I picked up the box and lo and behold... the graphic was purple, exactly the same as the first proof. So after I paid an additional cost for more proofs, after re-uploading and being treated inconsiderately by the customer service reps here, they messed up and didn't even deliver. At this point, it was way too late, so I didn't bother going through the rounds again (and paying more money). This was extremely frustrating and I won't be using them again.<//text>< pictures>

Whoever works at print papa is great. They are always available to answer your questions and helpful. I do recommend this websit to my friends and family for their service and good quality of the products and their fair price. There is no reason for me to go somewhere else for my personal and business prints.</text>

Ordered thick "hang tags" for my table linens business. The print color was perfect and the quality is exceptional. I had trouble finding tags with this thickness on other sites. They arrived in the expected time frame as well. Great job. I will reorder from this company.</review>

<Review>Read the bad reviews before you do business with these guys. The price online is a bait. I talked to Humberto, was promised that the price online will be the price paid. When I called to get a quote, it was double that online price. The attitude is really that they are doing you a favor, and not that they are providing a service. There are other better options our there in my opinion.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>
{'time': 1523075123897, 'text': 'Hi Adam,\n\nSorry for any misunderstanding. Our pricing is all posted online, and accessible to everyone. I assure you it is not "bait". The truth of what happened, is that when you received the initial price over the phone, it was not conveyed that you had multiple files. He gave you pricing for 5000 stickers using one file. It wasn\'t until we received more information from you later, that we discovered there were multiple files printing at various quantities. This would not be the same price due to the time required to set up the multiple files for press. This is common in the print industry and you\'ll find that our pricing is still very competitive! I hope you will reconsider and give us a chance.'}< /response>

I had a set of business cards printed with PrintPapa, they were done exactly to the specifications, and they shipped them on the day they said they would. No complaints at all.</Review>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Unfortunately, I can't recommend this winery. To be fair it wasn't based on their wine, but their lack of customer service and poor representation.

The same gentlemen that told me 5 days ago that we didnt need a reservation told me today, (after our 30 minute uber ride) that he had to be pick up something and would be there  1 hour after his posted hours because we didnt make a reservations.

I was able to validate that he was the same gentlemen who told me I didnt need a reservation and he even recalled our conversation details.

I then asked where we could go for an hour to try an work with him since we invested so much time to get to Laguna Canyon Winery.  He said you can go to the car shop, then said you can walk down the canyon to the the beach (no walking path and dangerous turns) or you can try a different. He apologized and said there was nothing he could do.

Please save yourself a trip, this winery stands alone  by itself in between auto collision and car repair shops. It's a shame that we didn't get to try the wines. I can't recommend this winery as there was no care or concern for their customers, you can't rely on their posted hours and this is a stand alone winery with no other choices.

We told our next Uber driver about our horrible experience at Laguna Canyon Winery and he apologized for the poor treatment and suggested we visit Mozambique.

The food, wine and service are amazing and the views are spectacular. Highly recommend Mozambique!!!!

< Review>
I was a little bit hesitant on coming because I really wanted to go out on an outside vineyard tour with the actual grapes in line in a garden but the owner is very personable and you can tell he is doing exactly what he loves. Wine is his passion.. the way he speaks and experience, he has had over more than 2 decades in the industry. He explained how he got into it and a few other locations he has wineries in as well as previous positions he worked in that he didn’t  like before getting into this business. A definite recommend. I am from NY and was just in the town but i do plan on visiting California more often and will definitely come back. The wines were great- never had a better merlot, and he has an option for whites and reds that are filtered and unfiltered. I really thought  it was cool that he had machines and a card system keeping track of the balance we can use and dispensing the wines for us at the same time.<//Review>

The wine was incredible, the reserve syrah was exceptional, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting.  We had a wonderful time tasting many of the wines they craft on site, and took home a bottle as well.<//Review>< Pics>

My Wife and daughter had never been to the San Antonio Winery before. Today I treated them to lunch. We had a delicious meal and enjoyed the wine tasting. The owner approached our table and he welcomed us and thanked us for coming. We left with 6 bottles of wine. I can't wait to open the Chocolate Bar wine. It tasted delicious. We had a long wait in line for food, but everything was worth the wait. We will be back soon.</text>

Marlo was awesome!  And his new wine tasting machines are perfect for the times.  Met the guys from Italy who created them.  I like them if the Winery is super busy but still like the server touch much better!!<//review>

We enjoyed every taste we selected. You truly can’t go wrong on anything. Make sure to have a meal prior because the only food is the meat cheese and crackers. As it should be so you know they focus on their amazing wine. This is a must if you are traveling at Laguna even for a day. We spent about an hour here and don’t forget to ask about their membership program. Casual date day event.

Meeting the winemaker

We visited on a Sunday which gave us the opportunity to have a relaxed and prolonged interaction with our server, who happened to be the proprietor and winemaker.  I learned new things about wine making, was happily corrected about things that I thought I knew but most importantly very much enjoyed the wine.</Text>

<text>This was one of the least enjoyable experiences at a wine tasting that I have been a part of (I've done a couple in Texas and one in SF). At this place, the staff just poured you the wine and that was the extent of their hospitality; no information or knowledge was shared regarding what we were drinking. In my opinion, that aspect of a wine tasting is half the experience.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Date>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>My husband and I attended a 1st Friday of the Month Wine Tasting Party that included a variety of appetizers, a super filling buffet, music and amazing wines! MANY of their wines are delicious and I'm so happy I have a new fave winery less than 30 minutes from my home.

I tend to be more of a red wine fan and I loved their 7 Barrel, Petite Verdot and Purple Paws. I was also pleasantly surprised to learn they have a raspberry sparkling. It will be a perfect addition to our holiday meals!

For $40, it was a great value, especially since we got 10 wine tasting on top of all the delicious foods. They even ended our meal with chocolate dipped cookies!!

I'd highly recommend for a girls night or date night.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

< Review>
I visit this place about twice a year, and I enjoy it every single time. I have also got an opportunity to visit their "backstage" where the magic of winemaking happens and that too was a great experience. Overall I really like this place, works for me!< /Review>

On the first Friday of the month, I had the distinct pleasure of attending a Wine Tasting Event at Laguna Canyon Winery.

As I walked in the doors I was greeted by one of the owners and several staff members. I was immediately made to feel welcome and really liked the feel of the place.

We enjoyed several red wines, white wines, dessert wines and more. My favorites were the 7 Barrel, Petite-Sirah and the Tawny Port. All in all the Friday night tasting includes ten - 1 ounce flights.  In addition to this there is live music and delicious food. I highly recommend Laguna Canyon Winery.< /text>

Tatiana and Patrick treated us like royalty.  Super knowledgeable,  attentive and kind. We loved so much we bought 8 bottles of wine! Love the Rose', the Sonoma Valley late Harvest Zin is sooo good and Los Carneros Sangiovese is mouth watering.  Also love that a portion of Purple Paws goes for the care of homeless pets & it's good too! I go for Purple Paws (great gift for animal lovers that drink wine) but go to taste, you won't be sorry you did.</text>

<Text>Came here past Friday night with a group of food and wine enthusiasts (EatNDrinkGeeks), for their 1st Friday of the Month Wine Tasting party from 6-9pm every month. Well, maybe not every month, but check the events calendar from their website.

It was surprisingly packed.  Outside parking was difficult to find as they share a lot with what looks like a car repair shop. Once inside, you can get 10 tastings of 1 ounce pours  and appetizers and hot food with no place to put your food. But you know what? I loved it here because the people here were super nice and Marlowe is super passionate about his award winning wines.  They've won numerous awards from the OC Fair.

They were serving whites on left side and reds on the side closer to the street. I am more particular to the Reds here because I love my Cabs. So I was able to taste their '12 Cab, the 4 blend, 5 blend, 7 blend, the syrah, and the cab syrah.  Taste wise, I personally like big, bold fruity flavors with some oak but not too overpowering. So without going into too much detail and sounding like a wine snob, I liked the 7 blend and the 4 blend the best here. It's like tasting an Anejo and a Reposado if this was tequila as the 7 was a bit smoother and the 4 was a bit younger but you can taste all the profiles.

The people behind the counter were super nice and hilarious. I got to meet Leann and Denise as they were pouring the white wines. Their Russian River Canyon Cuvee is quite nice, slightly dry, not sweet, and great on the nose with punch of fruit. Super easy to drink, probably best now.

They do all the blending in house I believe. There was a sign right above the entrance way stating they bring grapes from all over the place into here. The barrels inside the tasting room are real with wine fermenting away.  They do have a small water dispenser, which is my only gripe here. Definitely not big enough!

If you buy a wine during the event, you get to keep the etched glass.  Background wise, there was live music from Saeed Marandi. It was a fun time with fellow friends over wine. This place is definitely worth checking out when you're in the area like for SawDust down the street.</Text>< pictures>

<review>(Translated by Google) Laguna Beach is a nice little vineyard to try for $ 2, $ 4 per cup for a drink (various discounts and benefits when purchasing bottles). However, Shirah and Zinfandel do not have good gut

<review>Harbor freight a must visit store for any diy, mechanic, wood working or simply tool guy. They have everything from simple hand tools to specialty tools for just about any industry.  They offer many online coupons for discounts and freebies. Was very pleased with my visit bought simple hand tools for a very low price and even got free flashlight with coupon!  The waiting was a little too long and  necessary. Only one cashier for whole store.   So might be about 15min before actually paid.. it was for me.</review>< pictures>

Disappointed in the service! Which is a shame because the store layout itself is excellent and they have a great variety of products.

While in line at the only cashier open, a second cashier opened her till. A line starting forming, and I migrated over. Once it was my turn, NOPE! The cashier across the way didn't let me go, and directed a man from the other line to go ahead of me.

All other customers were confused, as there were clearly two lines formed. Why didn't the cashier prompt everyone to form a single line before it was my turn to go?</review>

<text>I came to this place for the first time based on a recommendation of a friend. Well it is the first and last time I come to this place. I needed help to find very specific tools and I was lost as to where I could find what I was looking for. No one offered to help after 15 minutes I approached an employee and it turned out to be the assistant manager Melissa. Well Melissa very unwillingly helped me and seemed bothered that I dared to ask for some assistance. She was clearly bothered with my request and she rushed me with my questions... Horrible customer service, I was a buying customer, I was not asking for anything free. Terrible experience, I’m never coming back. Based on the assistant mangers Melissa’s behavior I walked out of the store and did not buy anything.</text></record>

HFT does have a great return policy though.  Why 3 stars? I was giving it a 4 as a store, but took 1 star off for customer service.  Most employees are helpful and have a great attitude. But 1 employee can spoil the experience. I had an encounter with one of those employees and I also had an issue with 24 ppl in line and only 1 checkstand open. Unsatisfactory for a company who relies on their customers for success!</text>< pictures>

Called them to ask if they have a drillbit that drills thorugh cinder block, after on hold for 5+ mins I was re directed to a rude lady that said she didnt have time to look or help me. Wow, I have never exprinced this from a retail store.

I will never shop here. If I could give zero stars I would.

Guess I will stick with Lowes and Home Depot.</review>

They have very good prices and they warranty all of their product. The bad thing is their product most of the time needs a warranty because it sometimes doesn't work even out of the box. I have had that happen more than once</Review>

Looking for deals at a lower price than Lowes or Home Depot. Go to Harbor Freight. But compare quality and price first.< /Review>

Good place to buy hand tools as well as power tools. Just makes sure the your needs are met by double checking specifications of the items your purchasing.</Text>

I've this place. Over the past few years the quality of merchandise has improved in quality. I purchase a lot of my hand tools here and have not had any issues with them. I've also purchased a generator that's turned out to work really well.   They also have a few good accessories for my trailer. My next purchase will be a band saw and table router.  I recommend  getting the extended warranty when its offered. I've had to use it once and it was hassell free.   Can't go wrong with Harbor Freight.< /text>

If you have time to waste come here. Waited long in line, they had one cashier who looked lost. You would  think they open  up another  lane but no. Thought  it would  be convenient  but nope rather go to Lowe's or home Depot it is quicker despite being a big store. So if you're  bored and have all the time to waste and need some materials  then I highly  recommend  this place  for you.< /text>

< Review>
Bad customer service, it didn't exist. Came here this morning to avoid a trip to one of their competitors stores since it's so close to home but not one greeting, employees seemed to be avoiding eye contact and/or just more engaged w whatever was going on w their cell phones. Didn't buy anything, won't be back to this location. Love the store in Lakewood, Ca though!<//Review>

Its the place you should always go first for any need your project may require. Most of the tools are more than capable to do the same job as other tools but at a much cheaper price.</review>

Bring in your coupons on one of the many apps.  Btw, they are nice enough to point out when something qualifies for a coupon that you were unaware of.< /Review>

< review>
Love this place, but workers need better training. I called looking for chainsaw oil, and after being on hold for about 5min, i was told they had it.
I get to the store and looked around but couldnt find it. I went up to the checkout stand and said "hi, i called a few minutes ago looking for chainsaw oil and the guy said you had some". The girl at the stand seemed clueless and responded with "what?". I was kinda caught off gaurd at her lack of professionalism and overall etiquette, but i just thought to myself "dumb broad" and proceeded to repeat myself. Her second attempt to engage in simple dialogue resulted in the reponse "what's that?", with a blank face. Her next failed attempt at assisting a customer consisted of her pointing to the back and saying "look for the guy somewhere back there, he might know." She somehow managed to leave me a bit dumbfounded, especially since they have 2way radios and an intercom.
So i went up and down a few isles looking for "the guy". I had to explain what i was looking for because chainsaw oil wasnt as self-explanatory as i had believed it to be.
I follow "the guy" though different sections for about 5min to come to the conclusion that they dont have any. He says "uhh, yea, someone just bought the last one...". Considering him not knowing where to look for it, I'll safely assume that it was bs.
My hunt for chainsaw oil continued and i ended up ordering some from Amazon.</review>

<Review>This place sucks I was returning a battery charger that stoped working but was told I need original receipt which I don’t have. I was told I got my receipt e-maild when I bought it but I checked my mail and had nothing. They told me it could be a server error and that they could do nothing about it. So F this place<//Review>< userid>
