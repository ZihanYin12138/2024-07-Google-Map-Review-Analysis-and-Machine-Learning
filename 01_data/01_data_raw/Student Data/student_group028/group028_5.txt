The only time there is ever a hiccup is on the fries and curly fries at night. Its unusual if your get both and are both fresh. Other than that awesome. Thanks</Review>< gmapID>

<Review>After an Extremely Bad experience on Sunday 02/14/2021, I was Never going back to this location even though it was about minutes away from my home! However, I submitted a complaint online through the company's website and to my surprise the following day I was contacted by a JITB representative by the name of Priscila.
I explained to Priscila the details of what happened that night. I explained to her that it was not my first time at this location and that Usually the staff is Very Helpful and Friendly. However, that night this was not the case. I told her that upon placing my order at the drive-thru I asked the person taking the order to Please Not place ice in the drink. I had been experiencing flu-like symptoms and I thought the ice Would worsen this. When I arrived to the window to pay, the young lady by the name of "Teresa" (I know this b/c that was the name on the receipt) handed the drink to me. I Immediately noticed it had ice and Politely told her that I had asked for the drink with No Ice. What she stated next not only shocked me but it Extremely upset me as well. She stated "Well you should have told me when you placed the order!" Her manner was like she was scolding Me and she actually seemed upset for those couple of seconds.
I then stated to her that I Did let her know that I asked for No Ice in the drink. At No point did this young lady even take the time to apologize for a simple mistake. THAT to me was Even More upsetting! So I asked her for her name, to which she RUDELY replied "It's On The Receipt!" I then asked if her manager was available, to which she replied "I Am the manager." I asked her if she could please give me the name and number of her district manager and she again, stated yet Even More upset, "You can look it up online!"
I was Extremely Shocked and UPSET so I decided to place the formal complaint on the company's website. The JITB representative (Priscila) listened to what I had to say and the details of my experience that night. She Formally Apologized and Genuinely Understood and Empathized with my concerns. She Definitely "made-up" for the Extremely bad experience I had gone through that night. I would Definitely recommend this location to friends and family however, if something doesn't seem right then let it be known. And if you do "formally" complain for any reason rest assured that your issue Will Be addressed by JITB!</Review><user>108822208264494000358</user><Name>Rick B.<//Name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Fast service, friendly person at the counter. We had been seeing the chili burger combo on tv, I ordered 2 combos. Since we were from out of town and CoVid guidelines, we ate them in our RV after we parked for the night a few miles away.. Surprise! They forgot the chili on the burger.

I have been here twice since the CV19 scam-demic, because places closer to home are only doing drive-thru. The employees are very polite & friendly. I appreciate being able to pick up my food on foot, as I currently do not have a car for the drive-thru. I will remember their kindness when the fearporn ends and we return to business-as-usual.<//Review>

Requested a simple design. Two employees looked over it and assured me they could do it. Wish I could have gotten my money back definitely not worth it. Third slide is the reference photo.<//review>

<review>This place was such a good find. I got the lavish signature pedicure which was $35. It took around an hour including waiting for my polish to dry. They took their time on my pedicure and it was awesome. It also included a 10 minute foot and calf massage which felt great. The technicians we're very sweet and I just walked in for an appointment. The place is also very clean as well. The only thing I wish they had was SNS polish, but they do have gel and acrylic.<//review><Rate>5</Rate><gmapID>0x80c2bbae137694b7:0x420b6b46b84a33ba< /gmapID><Time>1566415864362</Time>< Name>

I just got a full set, I requested almond shape, and none of the nails are even, only 2 are actually shaped somewhat almond-like, the rest are bubbly oval-ish and look like they're melting to one side. Also she sawed into the sides of my nails until I yelped twice. The sides have nothing to them, barely any nail, no acrylic, she didnt even paint the sides. She ruined my nails. I complained as soon as I saw what this woman did, and they didnt seem to see the problem. I'm taking them off now. $40 wasted. I want my money back.<//Text>

Called in to make an appointment and inquire about prices since I had 4 cracked nails to repair. They were so kind and helpful over the phone. Once I arrived I was greeted and the nail technician did an amazing job repairing my nails and reshaping.

<review>Super convenient. Pay ahead and even pick colors before you go in. Once your nails are dry you simply walk out. You paid online when making the appointment and payment includes a 15% tip. Feel free to plus up your tip later if you received excellent service. I wish every nail salon worked like this!< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

I have never been loyal to any nail salon until I found Lavish Nail Bar.  I usually get a gel manicure every two weeks and a pedicure once a month.   In the past even with my gel manicure it would chip and peel a week into it.  At Lavish Nail Bar, I always choose the Gelish nail polish and the polish lasts me for over 2 weeks.  They have a variety of nail polishes to choose from and a very calming vibe.  I knocked down a star because they don't specialize in any design.<//Text>

< review>
So I went here twice....
I got acrylic nails both times... first time I went w my brother and I asked for a certain length and the guy doing my nails did it too short.. but I decided to let it fly and just go on w the day... the nail job was decent but some of the acrylic powder got under a few of my nails which was kind of disappointing.. I decided to go back and give lavish another shot and a lady did my nails (good length nice and smooth) but then literally not even two days after 2 of the nails snapped in half easily in the same day (and it was painless and I barely applied any pressure) but they still just broke... so.. I’m gonna have to say my experience with this nail salon isn’t the best and I can go down the street for cheaper and get a better job.....< /review>

< Review>
Lavish Nails opened up in Dec/Jan and i have been going ever since.
The staff is welcoming and friendly.
I’ve gone in for fills and a pedicure and have left happy each time. My nail technician, Kim, is amazing and careful with my nails and skin.
Will be returning for my fills again in two weeks<//Review>

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.
We took a dear friend of ours, who had been a loyal Lavish customer, to have a pedicure last month.  Our friend had a terminal illness. We expected decent and humane treatment. Unfortunately our was friend was met with rudeness and dismissive behavior. The staff acted as if they couldn’t wait for us to leave.
This was inexcusable and shameful.< /Text>

I had today the worst experience ever in this place.
The person who was doing my pedicure didn’t like that I asked to cut my nails short and i wanted to be sure that they were short, he said they are short enough.... I believed him but I wanted to be sure.
He got mad and stoped working on me, then the lady on the front desk came to finish the work but I prefered to go without saying anything, i wasn’t happy with the service.
When I went to my car wich was parked just in front, the man who was mad, came to me and threw away all the dirty water That he  used on my pedicure, just next to my car, I just left. i didn’t want to make the situation worst, but is the the most rude attitude that i had in a nail spa. !!! I won’t go back there never !!!< /text>

Our salesperson was very informative and answered all our questions. Unfortunately they did not have the phone at that location but found a location that did and set up everything for us to pick up there. The pickup was easy and phone was ready to go. One of my top experiences.</review>

Incompetent people working there to worried about cutting hair on their side jobs to help out a customer, not telling you the full details or being able to transfer your contacts and pics properly! Jay is the the one that couldn’t figure how to transfer and Brianna is the one that laughs at you when you make a complaint!!! Never have I ever been so mad for the neglect of Customer service......<//text>

< review>
I normally upgrade my phone in-store or they send out a rep to my house.  Due to availability I purchase through att website and had the phones sent to my house.  Thinking it was no issues I walked into the store asking if they can transfer my information from one phone to another (which has never been a problem).

There was no customer in the store at them time with to 2 reps sitting on there phone. When I ask if they help me with the transfer phone to phone.  She said her WiFi was slow your better off doing it at home.

Instructing me there’s plenty of YouTube tutorials, and apps I can download. She made it sounds like we were incompetent.  We only came in for the convenience.

I only write this because every other reps that help me upgrade my phone through att did this in under 5 mins

Edit: this was at 6:30pm pst 10/1/19 I’ve been there before and had lovely workers assisting me<//review>

Shout out to Bri, Jay, and Wid and the manager! All super freaking cool and hard working! Felt very welcomed and they aren’t robots unlike other carrier places were they seem like they’re are forced to smile but here feels genuine! Just all around super great service and I’m glad to become an at&t member! Also wid was so patient and understanding with us and took the time and broke down the plans and everything thoroughly and honestly just went above and beyond for me and my family and just helped us out so much. Just honestly glad I made the right choice of carrier and came here. Super happy a have a carrier that I feel cared about helping me out any way they can. ✌🏻😁<//Text>

My chihuahuas are unhygienic but they love getting primped and polished at Millie's! Their prices are the best around, and she's full of knowledge regarding all breeds of dog. Love this doggie grooming shop, been going for at least 5 years!<//review>

This place is super unprofessional! The lady told me one price and then bumped it up without my consent. I was upset about that. We talked about it prior to picking up my dog and still she didn’t understand why I was upset. She calls me to pick up my dog and tells me to never come back VERY AGGRESSIVELY throwing things at me yelling to “HURRY UP &GET OUT OF HER SHOP” while holding a broom stick threatening me that she’s going to hit me . Super unprofessional police report has been made.< /text>

I have been taking my Senior 10 year old poodle Mouna.
They know she bites and she is a very anxious dog and they are the only people who know how to calm her down.
Thank you guys for these past 4 years of grooming my dog!< /text>

<Review>We take our miniature poodle there for grooming and have for several years now. The owner there takes very good care to follow our directions as closely as possible. Clean feet. short hair all over his little body (puppy clip).
They are so gentle with him. Bob< /Review><username>Bob Beall<//username>< UserId.>

Honestly the owner cares very much about her dogs and  yours. She treats them as if they are her own. Prices very depending primarily depending on your dogs weight, and hair type. She tends to give you a discount if your dogs is well behaved (not always but it does occur from time to to time). Highly encourage you to get to know her. All her dogs are rescued and they are well taken care off.< /text>

<rating>1</rating><Review>DO NOT GO TO THIS GROOMER!
I usually have great things to say about businesses I have used,  and am not one to complain,  this will be my first BAD review.
The only reason I gave one star is because you have to give at least one to write a review.  This place deserves no stars.
I brought my beautiful,  fluffy,  Pomeranian in to be groomed,  I specifically told the owner, I DO NOT want my dog shaved. I still want him look like a pomeranian.
We agreed that she would  just trim the hair shorter, leave the fluff around the face and tail. I must have said at least 3 times , do not shave my dog.
Well, when I returned  to pick him up, I didn't even recognize my dog!
He was shaven as close to the skin as possible, whiskers were cut off, and there was a knick on his neck.
I was extremely disappointed,frustrated, and close to tears, but paid, and took my dog and left.
When I got home and was a little  calmer, I called the owner to let her know that I was very upset, and that she did not do as I asked.
I also said I wanted a refund, when she told me that she would not give me a refund,  I told her that I would be giving her a review and she said to me, "Go ahead, I'm shaking, you are crazy, go find a man to f@#! You good, stupid".
How's that for customer service?</Review>< pictures>

I took our border collie / blue heeler pup here. He is a handful around men & especially men who are trying to groom him. I know the groomers had problems with him being aggressive, & that probably made it hard to cut his hair. I understand that. But wow...

This type of dog is not supposed to ever have his fur shaved like this. Hes LITERALLY completely shaven everywhere. There are burn marks from the razor in certain places (like around his ears). They shaved his forehead, parts of his whiskers.... It's awful.
EDIT - he's now bleeding around his ears. Probably from scratching himself combined w the razor burns.

Dogs with double coats aren't supposed to be shaved. The people working there apparently don't know that. I guess they got his hair short - now I need to buy a shirt for him for sun protection and hope his hair grows back normally.

BUT I'm pretty worried it won't grow normally again & on some parts of his body the hair may not grow back at all.

Please be very careful before taking your dog here. I don't want you to pick up a puppy that looks like mine - it still makes me sad to see.</Text>

<text>Very disappointed, made an appointment for my schnauzer 2 days ago, they gave me an appointment for Saturday at 2:00 pm so I took her like 10 minutes before her appointment time, after 2 hours and 40 minutes  I called to ask if she was close to being ready, they said that they had not even started on her and If I wanted I could come pick her up or make another appointment because they were too busy, honestly I said I would rather pick her up, almost 3 hours on a cage no bath or anything that was really sad. So I will not be coming to this place again.<//text><rate>1<//rate>< Name>

Tried to drop my dog off but the lady was aggressive on my dog. My dog was scared and the lady just yanked the rope around her neck, I saw right before I left and as I walk through the window. Stay away from this establishment!!</review>

I specifically asked not to have them use an electric clipper on my little Maltipoo, Holly. I got her home and she had 5 scabs, some 2" long, one under her arm. She hasn't stopped shaking and she's 7 years old and has been commercially groomed her whole life. For this, I paid $48! I just moved to this area but I've got to find a better place!< /review>

<review>It's close to my home so i decided to give it a try.

My dog is 2 almost 3 and his 1st professional grooming was here. He is a small Yorkie and very,  very,  very timid around others.  He cut up in this shop.  (I posted a video on instagram @TiaAbram  for anyone not sure of how much this groomer will put up with,  A LOT lol )

it was hard to watch at 1st but then i sat down and calmed down,  my Yorkie started doing a little better.

Friendly customer service!</review>< pictures>

This is by far the WORST place I have even taken my dog. My dog is the friendliest and most playful dog and I dropped him off at this place at the time that they had told me. A couple of hours later, I go pick him up and instantly, my dog is so depressed and won't even let me touch him. He is one spoiled little guy so he loves being petted and loves playing but after picking him up, he was really depressed. I know that working with dogs can be difficult, but for my dog to be this way means they did something out of line in order to cut his hair and it is unacceptable. Never again will I bring my dog to this place and I suggest no one else does either if you don't want your dog to be beaten or God knows what. I would seriously give this place a -10 star rating if I could. My poor little dog :(< /text>

This place was a nightmare .... took my 2 fur babies with specific instructions as to what I wanted done ... I have 2 Siberian huskies and my male is a wolly my female is puffy but needs to be brushed since she holds her fur she doesn't shed I told them they must brush before giving baths for they will get terrible knots they didn't listen ! My female had knots and they claim it was already there 🤦‍♀️ spoke to me as if I neglect my dogs it was 730 when I showed up to get them I dropped them off at 3 I told her I need to go she refused to give me my female I had to threaten her and tell her I'd call the cops if my baby was not handed over immediately ... she wanted to say if I'm o  a hurry I'm going to be charged more I don't know how I'm rushing her my pups were there for almost 5 hrs it's a joke lady knows nothing about anything can't groom a husky the way u do a Chihuahua she should be closed down I know my babies were not taken to use the bathroom I felt horrible to c they didn't get loved as they should and being away from home for so damn long never again please save urself a heart ache and avoid this witch for real</text>

OCTABIO was wonderful and he's great at what he does! He picked up and dropped off my 110lbs Labrador-Retriever and 20lbs Shih-tzu.... They came home fresh, handsome and free of skunk odor (yeah, my big one got skinked!). He was good to them!!!!!<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Great Indian grocery shop.
Not far from my work, I have been a regular customer to this place now for last eight months.
I get a lot of Indian stuff from here.
Almost everything is available here and at better prices (in comparison to other Indian store nearby).
The guy at the counter (owner, I think ) is also very friendly and helpful.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I got a good deal on a gold chain 4 yrs ago. Every time since, they seem surprised like your at someone's house. A man in the front door cage who smells strangely, ask a barrage of questions, while looking at me like I might be trying to rob them. I understand they need the security. If they read this I hope they will understand that in the USA we do and think the same way. But we smile try to act polite .I know its Bull Sh...! #1rule is make customers feel special(they will spend more and return more often if they  walk away feeling good.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Amazing..... can't get a job anymore "neighborhood shop" then this. Beautiful store, awesome personalities, and basically just what you would expect and that little community store that you walk to everyday to buy cigarettes. Simon is awesome, dude knows this s*** and it's nice being able to talk to somebody who is as real as he is. Thanks<//review>

Customer service is even great however I have came two times during business hours and have been inconvenienced. It's 12 54pm now and I've been waiting awhile. Smh last time it was close to this time but the doors were locked and they weren't open smh.  Business should be handled accordingly. And I'm updating because the big guy isn't the friendliest and they CONTINUOUSLY run out of product, with false promises of next week never happening.</Review>< Pics>

The glass art here is impeccable. Not one single piece is the same. It was astonishing to me to see such organization, and carefully well thought out detail. I was pleased to have an opportunity to drink my Gatorade and chat with the owner and here about all of the talent that comes through his store. I'm so very impressed.</Text>

Very poor selection. Charged 27.99 for a 60ml bottle of red's apple that's 15.99 at a shop very close by. They carry 3 varietys  of keaton and charge the same price for either size bag. Unfortunately this is the closest vape shop to me but I've never left without feeling like I was conned.< /Text>

This would be an ideal place since I could walk there in about 2 minutes - yet I'm apt to drive out of my way to go somewhere else. A fairly well stocked place with tobacco and all the related glass and steel products one would expect to see... Yet every time I've been in there to make a purchase - both in small and large dollar value - the employees have seems indifferent to my business. I have observed patrons that look like "play'as" with the air of wads of cash in their pockets get pretty snappy service - so if you fancy yourself one, step right in and present your attitude... On the other hand if you're a local looking to patronize a place long term - perhaps consider somewhere more friendly to the unassuming type.<//text>

Just came back to say that I still LOVE this place. I introduced it to my roommate who currently stopped smoking cigarettes. She knew nothing about vaping, and they are just so knowledgeable about their products and so helpful with helping you choose what's best for you.< /text>

The pics make the place look pretty cool. They only advertise “Dulce Vapor” as far as brands of vape juice they carry but went to see if maybe they do carry a variety of brands & if so, what their prices were like. Unfortunately their doors were locked even though I went during what they claimed their business hours were. Definitely needs a website or more pictures/ information regarding the vape juices they carry before I would even consider wasting ANOTHER trip only to find out they are “open” with the doors locked... again. Sucks cause I really wanted to like this place!< /Review>

I love this place. First off Simon is both knowledgeable and friendly... He has a keen sense of service. Not a bad sense of customer service either. Been coming here for years but glad I stopped long enough to talk to him. Affordable juices and vapes... Even has tobacco products... One stop shop... Go on in and tell Simon I said hi...<//text>

When I first walked in, I noted that the place was quite well organized, something that you don't often see in many smoke shops... There is usually stuff all over the place in random order. Not here. The shelves were neatly stocked, all the merchandise looked appealing, and what was most important was that they had what I needed in stock, a bottle of butane, after I had called two other smoke shops nearby as well as checked CVS and Kmart to no avail. Thank you guys!</Text>

<Review>Cheating rude liars - do not shop here.  Made two purchases, both were a hustle - what they rang up in no way matched what they stated.  Then claimed every excuse,  credit card fee (against all credit card terms of service), then they said tax, which calculated out to about 27%.  And then of course when the bogus vape they sold me didn't even work,  they wouldn't replace it because I opened the package, even though it was unused.  Eventually got a refund from my credit card provider. But these guys are total lowlifes. Avoid at all costs!<//Review><name>Brad Altfest< /name><pictures>None<//pictures><UserId.>104592698250528725997<//UserId.><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I live around and they have the best prices in the neighborhood for hookah tobacco and charcoals,

The guy is so nice and so useful,

my hookah doesn’t smoke well anymore he took time to explain me how to fix it instead of trying to sell me a new one,
It’s the only shop I go now.</Text>

<text>Came in to buy a replacement mod for my vape. I showed the owner what I was currently using and he offered a $80 mod which he told me was great and would work for me.  Used it for two days, and although the unit technically works, it does not suit my needs .I went back and was told all sales final - no exchanges or anything. So I was sold a product under false prestenses and then denied an exchange.  Horrible customer service and possibly shady business (or they do not know about the products they sell)  Either way, avoid at all costs!!!</text>< Pics>

This place is awful. They have hardly any selection on vape flavors and the few flavors they do have are so over priced its insane. Theres a vape shop down the street on Beverly that has so many flavors and you can sit and try each flavor before purchasing them at $10 to $15 dollars cheaper.  The thing that really was the icing on the cake for me was the guy working wanted to charge me $5 dollars to change a coil for me. BAAAHAHAHAHA. They lost there damn minds I never have had a vape shop be so petty .  I got to all kinds of vape shops and this is by far the worst one I have ever had the displeasure of doing business with. Please go pass this place by and head east on beverly 5 minutes away there is a real vape shop the will take care of you. None of those know it all workers who will say anything to get into your wallet, unless your into that sort of thing.<//text>

<Text>Was near the grove and wanted to go to a vape store. Looked up this little place and ended up buying the Smok Cloud Beast tank cause the guy was cool to me and my girl. Competitive prices for a small place and has all the basic selection. They even filled up my tank and gave me a free bottle of juice so that's why 5 stars!< /Text>< time>

I bought a snow wolf vape here based in the employees recommendation and have had nothing but issues with it. I was new to the vapes and am trying to quit smoking cigarettes. The employee who sold it to me also put it together for me before I left. I left the shop and it didnt seem to have any problems,  but when I tried to take off the tank, the employee put the coil in wrong, jamming the tank tight. I had to return the next day to have someone fix it. Well a few weeks have gone by and now the mod is completely burned out. You can imagine how pissed I am after just spending 180 and only having it last 3 weeks. Needless to say, the guys who work here are pretty clueless so don't listen to anything they have to say. Better yet just stay away from this con shop.

And just read the responses he gives to his unsatisfied customers. We're the best, we're the biggest, blah blah. This place is trash. And just check out the location... trash neighborhoods attract trash business.<//Text>

What a rip off!!! Carton of American Spirit $110. Juul 4 pack $34.99 OMG do they think everyone is Stupid!!!

Anywhere else American Spirit $85 a carton, Juul 4 pack never more than $24.

These guys are rude and believe you are stupid for buying here

Looking at the good reviews here, obviously the owner gets others to write good Phony reviews.

Its a shame, there are a lot of tourists in the area, this is probably the only place close by and these guys Milk-em</Text>

Came here to chek it out and ended buying a new rba tank along with some materials. The owner helped me build the new adomizer and gave me agood price on it since it was new to the both of us. In the other hand the staff was still new to vaping however eager to learn and brought up youtube videos on how to build the new tank. Def my new vape store to go. Highly recommended! For all your vape neds.</text>

Horrible service. Tried to buy a vape and he pretty much convinced me to go somewhere else with his attitude. Not sure how they do business like that.</text>

<Review>Get rid of the cigs. Boo stinkies. Yaaay vaping :) jk but I dont like seeing vape n smoke shops combined because it will lead more people who are out to ban vaping to categorize vaping and smoking together. But I lime that when smokers go to buy a pack they see all the vaping gear and it may save another person like myself from cancer sticks.</Review><GmapID>0x80c2b930f2ba9281:0x6455ee4abba0ce21<//GmapID><resp>{'time': 1439056329654, 'text': 'The only reason for cigs is to attract actual smokers and save them by giving them a chance to try vaping and see the difference themselves'}<//resp><Pics>None<//Pics><user_id>112607381905617671840< /user_id><Name>Sarah Brigida< /Name><Rating>3<//Rating></record>

<Review>Very high prices and your Vape won't last very long also they close early most days kind of sucks when you're driving a distance to get here because it says they're open and the store owner said that if you ever have any problems you can come in and they'll help you with the product not as they're closed</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) Seriously expensive. I went to buy a juul and I just bought it without knowing the price, but it costs $34.99 for 4 pieces. The same product is sold at convenience stores for $29. Once purchased, there is no refund.

심각하게 비싸다.  juul사러갔다가 가격모르고 그냥 샀는데 4피스짜리 34.99불입니다. 똑같은 상품을 편의점에서는 29불에 팔고있습니다. 한번 사면 환불안됩니다.<//text>

< Review>
I love the well structured classes. The screens allow me to push myself harder and they also allow the coach to see if I need to push harder to meet my goals. I like being told what to do in the gym,  it takes the guesswork out of having to make up my own routine. I'm confident that I will post an update soon about my own physical progress.

Update: new treadmills are legit,  show you your stats in real time: shows us total distance, time, avg pace,  max pace,  etc..  I didn't think this place could get any better but it has<//Review>

I love that the classes are well structured.  The screens help me push myself,  as well as allow the coach to see when I should be pushing harder. I'm a competitive person so seeing my numbers rise in real time is pretty awesome and motivational.<//Review>

<Text>Just went there for my free trial and I must say WOW! Very impressed with their regimen and the professionalism that is presented throughout. Samantha (Sam) did an amazing job making my wife and I feel comfortable with all of the workouts and ensuring we knew what was going on throughout the session. The two hosts were amazing as well! Definitely a must try! You will not be disappointed.< /Text>< Date>

This place only caters to the local demographics. Front desk Rep didn't even think I was a potential customer. Gave me the 3rd degree. Stay away from this place, they only cater to upper tax bracket people< /Text>

< Review>
Was ready to finally try out OTF!! I called today to set up my first "free trial" class. Since I dont actually live in the city of the facility (I live 7 mins away mind you) then I had to pay for the class. They were "willing" to give me a discount for the trial class. That was such a turn-off to me that I said forget it. I've previously done Xfit for a long time and expected/prepared to pay a high rate membership, but I felt mislead. Already looking for something else & already told others about my experience before even actually trying it out.< /Review>

<text>Great experience and the classes really motivate me to push myself to continue and give my all.
I love that it combines cardio with weights and your heart is monitored during the process.
Alex, who oversees the workout classes I attend is fantastic. He is on top of things and watches out for you if you are doing an exercise incorrectly and that is super important for me since I am over 50 and have not done an intense workout in over 20 years.
I like that I receive an email as soon as I finish a class with the amout of calories burned and splatpoints.
The staff is very helpful and quick returning messages.
Their app is very convenient to schedule appointments among other things.<//text><gmap_id>0x80c349e89f6b0b3d:0x739550be045d586e< /gmap_id><username>C Grau</username><resp>None</resp><user_id>109620258467355348037<//user_id>< time>

I was literally turned away from coming to class. I understand you have your 5 minute grace period, but I made it ON TIME and I was still not allowed because my spot was "filled"!! I was shown some ridiculous paperwork that my place is not guaranteed (which completely defeats the purpose of signing up), and then I was turned away from all the rest of the classes of the day because they had a waitlist!! As a business owner, my clients come first and foremost, and the girl at the front desk (Beth I think her name is) started dancing to the music in the gym when I told her I wanted to cancel my subscription. You all are not doing any of us a favor!! I am working mother with an 8 month year old trying my best, and I get treated as trash! For the price I am paying, and the length I have been there I expected so much more...<//review>< Time>

Sad to see that Pho Craft is gone. The owners were very nice, friendly and excellent chefs. I will miss their food and company. I wish them the best and hope they give it another try when we get past the current situation.

Update from the staff at Pho Craft:

We are happy to announce that we are open for take out orders beginning Monday, May 18th.

Our current Store Hours
Monday-Saturday: 11:00 am - 8:00 pm
Sunday: Closed

12/19
The House Special Pho was highly recommended and I can see why. The broth is rich and has a depth of flavor that reflects the use of cooking the soup with the bones for hours. We had a chance to speak to the chef who described how she makes the broth. No wonder it tastes so good.

Delicious food and friendly staff. Just a nice place to have a good meal. Prices are very reasonable.< /text>

Pho Craft is no more sadly, it's changed to Pho May.  Pho Craft was special. The owner was nice and remembered us whenever we came in.  I think Pho May might be Pho May the chain, which is pretty typical.  Good, but not on the same level as Pho Craft.  I hope they manage to reopen after the pandemic.< /review>

Found a new Pho place in Cypress. I ordered the brisket and Ribeye meats with the small fresh rice noodles. I was surprised the broth was flavorful to my liking. Just the right amount of spices. The menu is simple and to the point.  There is something for everyone. I met the owner and complimented her on the restaurant opening and wished the business well. Support small businesses because it matters. If you like this review, please click the like button. Thank you and have a good day!< /text>

Like the idea of being able to choose your broth and 2 proteins, or going with one of their combinations. I had their seafood special which had shrimp, fish, squid and imitation crab with fresh noodles and the usual pho fixings...delicious! They were a little short-staffed today so service was a little slow,  but they did have a help wanted sign on their window.< /text>

Nice friendly atmosphere. The restaurant is clean. We went there a little bit before lunch time, by the time we done, there's a line. The pho was good. The broth was just right, neither salty or sweet. The meats were tender and juicy. Overall, we had a great time with the food and the people. Highly recommend if you are in the area.<//Text>

Had the house special pho, and it was absolutely delicious! The small bowl was easily the size of the large bowls at some other places, and it has lots of delicious meat and noodles.</Review>

The service takes forever and as knowing what true Vietnamese phở tastes like. The food came in big portions. All of the food was salty and it came in such big sizes that it felt disgusting. The price was reasonable fit how much they gave. They are very understaffed and it took a long time for tables to be bussed. I wouldn't go back.< /Text>

< Review>
I'm a Vietnamese living in the Bay Area (San Jose) in Northern Cali where there are lots of Pho places. The pho's broth at this place is just OK. Just need a little more salt. For the price they charged, they're being cheap on the filet mignon. Not the best pho that I've ever had. I wouldn't come back to Phocraft again.<//Review>

<resp>None</resp><name>Iris Luo< /name><Text>(Translated by Google) The first time I eat Vietnamese rice noodles in this shop, the price is higher than the average shop. But the amount is more, the real thing is that the main beef noodles will give you a big ribs and beef slices. The only thing I didn't like very much was that their soup base was salty.

第一次在这家店里吃越南米粉，价格比一般的店高一些。但是给得量也比较多一些，很实在的是主打的牛河粉里会给你一块大大的排骨，和牛肉片。唯一我不太喜欢的是他们的汤底咸了一些。< /Text>< rate>

I stayed for four days here. Arrive before 10pm or be locked out despite having a gate code (reservations). I had to rent a hotel the first night as the ca.reservation.gov website made no distinction between a closed gate with code lock, versus a locked gate with hard time of entry. The code was effectively useless.

So be sure to arrive before 10pm.

I easily spent 100$ to not sleep in my car at the local motel the first night. It was better than the campground or never falling asleep in my car.. but it over doubled my renting expenses in a single night. Also, bring a n95 mask for the porta-potties, as the normal public bathrooms are closed off.

Area is lush in grass and walking trails are alright though privacy is near non-existent. Many campsites were empty despite the foot traffic. I always had another human in my peripheral vision during my time there, let alone earshot. Area seems to be a magnet for folks who just want to throw a frat party in the woods; enough noise to drown out the local birds fighting on the riverside from 9pm to 11pm.

Mosquitoes are a consistent nuisance out there but I did not encounter hornets as others describe when I started grilling or prepping.

Camp host was polite and drives by your campsite on golf cart; at least makes a round of the sites about 4-5 times a day to my witness. I would definitely visit on a day trip for the shore, but I will pass on staying the night again.</review>

<review>This campground is a decent place to stay when traveling.  I would not call this place a destination, but merely a stopover when traveling North or South along I-5.  The campground is far enough from the interstate that traffic noise is minimal. Some sites have power and water. No dump station (Red Bluff RV Park $10 to dump).  Paved walking trails are nice.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>It's extremely open and feels more like a day use picnic area than a campground. It's in a young grove of oak trees that provide a decent amount of shade but no privacy. Campsites are practically on top of each other. The bathrooms are locked and you need a code to enter. They were clean the first day we got here but after 3 days, they have not been cleaned or restocked. There are flush toilets and coin operated showers and roaches in the sinks.

It's dog friendly and I've had no complaints about my 4 dogs but they definitely need to be leashed here. There are tons of ground squirrels that drive the dogs crazy and their holes in the ground make walking around challenging. There are also tons of flies and wasps. Dont plan on cooking here, we were swarmed by wasps as soon as we took our camp stove out every time. The camp host is also rude and unwelcoming, asking us multiple times about our reservations and how long we are staying. He and the park ranger seem to be buddies and drive around all day eyeing you down.

Okay spot to sleep in a pinch or if you have an RV. I would not stay here again.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeoPnLRBzlZ0jNfxPlD8WUVdfDqgRCZhrfrx1B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnRa3AC6AoyoY7kskivR2ql9gNQbMf6rYbNjPP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMjO83rw0872FUpumDSjYiMF_x3oApp7VIXXks=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8C3uotdAUAjd3sSB6w8BM2FKqVHcutTHF8qiq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

<review>The campground itself is nice aside from mostly smaller sites and not too much privacy. The trees are beautiful, lots of grass, and it's close to the river. There are trails to hike.

The downside is the noise from outside of the campground. There's some kind of industrial building close by and there a noise like a jackhammer in the distance, all day and night, every 5 seconds (literally). The train also passes through nearby a couple times per night.

Price: standard tent: $16. Electric and water: $25. Group site: $30. As of mid-September.

Bathrooms: clean, one has dry toilets and the other has flush toilets with quarter-operated showers.

While I wouldn't stay here for a weekend (due to the noise) it was fine for a place to stop for the night while passing through. You can bring some earplugs. :)</review><Time>1473693740076< /Time><user>113133628803642425505</user>< gmap_id>

Sadly, this has become a less-than desirable spot in the past couple of years. Although it is a beautiful campground along the Sacramento River, it has become mostly a place for homeless folks to live. They game the reservation system so they never leave, just move from campsite to campsite. Very few spaces occupied by folks passing thru, like us. The camp host doesn't really seem to care, or has no power, not sure which.</Review>

Far enough from the interstate to be fairly quiet. Showers have combination lock the host occasionally changes the combination to. Some sites have electricity, most don't Most sites are well shaded. Beautiful, clear Sacramento River is a stone's throw away and there is access. In addition to the host, there is also a Forest Service post at the south end of the campground. So it's well patrolled. The nature center at the entrance has displays of local wildlife, fish migration, etc. There's also a native plant nursery next to it with plants labeled. The reserve you drive through on way to the campground (a dead-end road) has trails where I saw two bucks and a do standing in the meadow. Lots of rare birds. Watch for snakes if you hike around though. Fortunately this jewel is close to the town of Red Bluff so if there is any need for emergency service, it's right there. All in all a beautiful nature preserve on the upper Sacramento River. Some terrific bike trails- the kids will love it.< /text>

The campground was nice. Lots of shade in some sites and grass. Some sites have pull through a and some have electricity/water hookups. No dumping station. Bathrooms appear to be cleaned every other day, alternating Men’s and Women’s. Showers were one quarter for a few minutes. Pressure was ok. Could have used a cleaning, but not filthy.

There were what appeared to be quite a few homeless people staying there. Probably 1/3 to 1/2 of the sites.</Text>

The campground was maybe 1/3 full. Both nights were peaceful and great. Lots of trees and shade. Highway 5 and railroad noise noticeable but not annoying, we slept well. For $16 it's a good deal, but the extra $8 booking fee charged by recreation.gov (it's a federal recreation area) makes it a little less cost-effective. Exploring the now-defunct fish ladder and dam/lock was cool, and it's a very large park area, with hiking/biking trails for miles. We stayed in site 30 and 31, liked them both.</Review><user_name>Shannon Rogers</user_name></record>

Nice place to camp in Red Bluff, Mendocino National Forest. The campsites are all on the grass, some under trees but there's not much separating each site from another. So if your neighbor's are noisy or have a bunch of kids then you will hear them.

There's a fire pit, BBQ and picnic table for each site. Some sites have hookups for water and electricity for an extra fee.

Regular campsites are $16 and can only be paid online with a debit or credit card through Recreation.Gov.

They DO NOT accept CASH here.

There is an onsite host 24/7 who is a little rough around the edges but overall is pretty good at communicating with campers and keeping the grounds maintained.

Bathrooms for men and women w/showers .25 for 4 minutes.
Hot and cold water.

The river is close by and boat launch. There are a couple of trails to walk and check out all of the neat birds that migrate to the area. We found some awesome wild blackberries growing along the paths.

It is very hot all day and all night. We stayed in July. It is definitely not a place to camp to get away from people but it is nice if you want to mingle with other campers. DOGS are welcome.</Text>

This park is such a pleasant place to go. No homeless people bugging you for money or cigarettes. Mostly people that go to this park are coming here to fish as there is a boat ramp. And in the summer it is very active here. Lots and lots of fishermen and people picnicking.< /text>

The best campsite! Has great, super clean bathrooms. Always stocked, with electric outlets. Many of the sites have their own electric and water of course. The site was all cleaned up. You can't ask for much more! The sites are a little close together. You can hear everyone's conversations. But no way near as bad as some sites south of here. All together a great spot for the money. Completely worth 40 bucks for two nights. Oh- don't forget to make your reservations online!<//Text>

This was at one time the Sacramento river drag boat racing home. Much like the fare grounds raised kits to win tire track has changed.
Both places get my vote water is cold dogs love it. Wonderful trails made for all to enjoy. One night camping gate is locked at 10 pm. Number of sites is low bag it or in your home on the road. Small town but a wonderful place to explore. Just the other night we got to see the moon rise between peek of mt.lassen .the biggest moon rise i have seen on west coast. Thank you all for letting me share.</review>

This is a local jewel of a resource for enjoying camping at a national park in our own back yard. From the well maintained facilities to the diligent staff, we are blessed to have this campground in our town. From camping out to going fishing or Taking your boat out, this has it all.  Free parking and boat ramps and clean restrooms, a souvenir shop, the camp ground has bathrooms and coin operated showers that last long enough to finish before the water shuts off. Fire pits, you can throw up a tent or bring a fifth wheel, and while there's a little life when the campfires roar and your enjoying your favorite barbecue, it gets real peaceful and beatiful especially on a star filled night. Whether your a visitor or a local, this is a secret treasure that I visit regularly.<//Review>

<Review>This place was not what I expected. Our original campsite smelled absolutely awful. Was next to the restrooms, but it was as if the sewage was coming up through the ground (there was no smell in the actual bathroom). Reservation was moved to another site, but not one with the electricity that er paid for. We were settled in between two sets of people who "lived" there, along with their cat that constantly came to us wanting food. The people in charge of the camp were quite rude to us on more than one occasion. I will definitely NEVER camp there again, nor will my friends and family...and will also never reccomend to a complete stranger.< /Review><resp>None< /resp>< Pics>

<text>For a campground that could be quite nice it appears homeless have moved in.  This is supposedly a reservation only and 14 day stay.  There are tent camps that appear to have been here way longer than 14 days.  We are afraid to leave our motorhome unattended.  We will not recommend unless changes are made.

An update to my review.  Apparently the park security were aware of the homeless camps in this campground and the people were asked to leave and they have.  This is a problem in this area but it is being worked on.  Because of this the campground is by reservation only.  It is so sad, I must say, to see so many homeless in this area.  Home ownership is out of the question and rents are much too high!!  Drugs are a serious issue!!
This is not a destination campground but a nice stop just off Interstate 5.<//text>< Gmap_id>

The worst camping experience my family has ever had. My kids & I were scared, so we moved to another spot and it was just as bad. I dont think we will ever forget this awful experience, which is sad because it is a decent location. Bathrooms very dirty, host was responsive to us moving & appologized. But the homeless in one area were drunk and using other peoples electrical outlets. In both areas there was fighting, arguing & cursing (some definately on drugs). Something needs to change here, not safe!<//review>

<review>My husband and I camped here this last weekend July 13th and July 14th. It was the worst camping experience we have ever encountered! The camp host and his area is very slumish, he was rude! We we're in site 24. And it smelled of sewer so bad we had to move. The parking area for two cars per site is not even big enough for two small cars. There are numerous drug addicts, drug dealers and homeless that stay in sites 21, and 23. We we're immediately told by one druggy that we we're too load and woke him up and that we blew it . All weekend we could not leave our site to even go for a walk or enjoy the Sacramento river. We watched the camp host on several occasions hanging out with the druggies. Late night on saterday the 13 the  we had witnessed 3 different cars pull up exchange money for meth then leave! We packed up and left our site the next morning! The camp host needs to be fired asap and drug enforcement need to come in and ride them all from Thais camp ground!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

It has now been overrun by the local homeless tweakers and the forest service has decided to make it a reservation only campground so it is now a place to bypass. Last time we stayed here I was very uncomfortable and that was it for me. Keep on going for someplace else, this is unsafe now.< /Text>< Pictures>

Very serene and quiet. A park-like setting next to the decommissioned Red Bluff Diversion Dam and fish ladder on the Sacramento River. There were not many campers on the day we were there (Tuesday/Wednesday). There is a garden with native plants and a visitor center staffed with very friendly people next to the campground. The only downside is the constant hiss of a vaccum release from the paper mill across the river every 5 seconds (really, I timed it).<//Review>

Could have been a lovely little park. Hiking was awesome. SITE great except grass not mowed much. BUT there have been homeless here, drugs and constant in and out of young people who curse and yell.  We reported twice already within 6 days and we wanted to stay 2 weeks.  (We prepaid) Not sure we will stay. No host either.  So sad. Neither my husband or me feel safe here.< /text>

<gmapID>0x80828499809ee42b:0x2ecb994aaf10f91b<//gmapID><text>I guess we lucked out. The host was a friendly, nice lady who greeted us and was helpful. The only downside was that the park gate closed at 10pm and we were returning at 10:20pm. It was a 3/4 miles walk to the camp... and I hated the thought of disturbing the host.

But I have no complaints at all. Lovely setting near the river--could easily be a weekend destination or a longer term place for serious RV folk. For us, it was a one nighter that had spots and was cheap. It was a stopover on the way to Oregon but, I will remember this and come again.

Oh, and eat at the homey riverside dive bar with great pizza from a brick oven.  And the best calzone Ive ever had. I'm a foodie. R's Locker--I would drive hours out of the way to go to this sports bar again. Kids loved it. Just 10 minutes from camp too.< /text><user_id>118390269501512390830< /user_id><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>DO NOT STAY HERE. We stopped in overnight just to take a break from our long drive. Campsite was smaller than expected. Showers were paid which is not mentioned anywhere on the contract or website so we did not get to shower. The bathroom was so disgusting there were woman's tampons and pads all over the floor because of the overflowing garbage and there was feces on the floor of the women's bathroom. We will never stay here again.< /text><date>1533309289652<//date><resp>None<//resp><Rate>1<//Rate><user_id>111910096920421589078<//user_id>< gmapID>

< Review>
Sycamore grove is the worst campground i have ever camped at.in fact its not even a campground,its more of a dayuse park that was converted into a campground and is definitely not worth the 16$ a night.
Lets start with the campsite itself.the sites here are so small that your basically 2 feet from all neighboring campsites which gives you no privacy at all.the sites are filthy ( my firepit was full of fast food containers and cigarette butts dirty bandaids) and theres so many wasps, bees,and flies that make it impossible to cook anything at your site without being constantly attacked by bugs.the bathrooms here are locked with a number code that your not given in the conformation reciept and so your forced to ask the fat hillbilly redneck host to give you the code as he gives you dirty looks.bathrooms are disgusting and only cleaned by the lazy slobs that work here once a week.there is also no soap in the bathroom.
The host that works here is very unwelcoming and does absolutely nothing all day but ride around on a golf cart harrassing the campers.last night at 8pm the host rudely rolls up in a golf cart shining lights all over my site asking me for my conformation receipt for the second time in one stay. The host is a bored loser that instead of cleaning and filling the large holes allover the property created by moles digging up the ground,hes standing there with the 3 other rednecks that work here talking loudly and setting off sprinklers for 2 hours straight.
Long story short,the scumbag host and his wife act like these campgrounds are their property in their backyard,do and work on absolutely nothing,live there for free and hate when campers come to use the sites.the way this host is living here for free and abusing the position of host makes me sick. I would rather die than stay another night at sycamore grove campground</Review>

Looked like a decent park. But the 'RESERVATIONS ONLY' billboard that greeted us upon entry in the end drove us away. As full-time Rver's (12 years) we stay in a lot of Federal Parks, mostly USFS and COE. We rarely make reservations. At Sycamore Grove (ignoring the silly sign) we pulled into a site that read 'OPEN', and walked around the park to meet the hosts, per instructions for those arriving without reservations. There we were told that despite being parked in a 'open' site, and despite the fact that the campground was pretty much empty, we had to call in a 'reservation' and pay a $10 fee.to do so. Plus the fee for our site; $22 I think it was. But by then it didn't matter. We left and moved to a private campground in town.< /Review>

Fairly quiet, no internet, no dump station, no permanent campers. Registration Online only. Several paths for hikers and bicycling.  Tents. Travel trailers and motorhomes. Host on duty is friendly. Big downside, puncture vine (goathead) ABUNDANT.<//text>

Wish showers were not an additional, fee and they had a generator area. I would rather pay $2 more for the site than be tricked and price jabbed.<//Review>

<review>As another reviewer mentioned, a little noisy. But not too bad.

Just remote enough to feel "next to nature" instead of "parked in a sardine can". Adjacent to the Sacramento River, and there's a cool little botanic garden on the grounds too. Sites are shady and reasonably spaced, surrounded by grassy areas.

For folks who need hookups - - $16 per night including some pull-throughs. That's pretty much un-matched in our experience.<//review><gmapID>0x80828499809ee42b:0x2ecb994aaf10f91b<//gmapID>< date>

<Date>1467476166617</Date><Review>Highway, industrial rock or log crushing all night right next to campground. Early morning some sort of high volume industrial dryer whine running on other side of camp for hours. Pretty, but can't sleep unless you have a well insulated camper or are hard of hearing. None in my party slept. Hot shower and toilets for 16. Wolfson bridge was 31 for night...way too high for state park tenting with family....but it was quiet and wish we had been able to afford. .</Review><pics>None</pics><username>Heather< /username>< Rate>

<Text>Stopped to get a couple of Chicken Sandwiches.  The bread was burnt, the chicken way over cooked and nothing else except a slice of pickle. No sauce, nothing. Then when you go to the door they are locked and will not open the door.  They want you to wit and drive through the line again.

DON'T Stop here!  Nasty!< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Bad food, bad service. I love a good Big Mac but you won’t find that here. The soda machine sprayed syrup all over me, they ignored me when I asked for a napkin. They couldn’t make my sandwich right, I took it back and they kept the sandwich, called the police and said to get out. Wow.</text>< Pictures>

Had the simplest order, two cheese burgers with no pickles. One cheese burger was made fine the next had no meat, ketchup or onions. Called three different times, and of course as I expected no answer. Trash food. I feed my dogs better food than this.< /Review>

We went through the drive thru. The woman that took our order was wonderful. She seemed to be cheerful and happy to take our order. Upon getting our order we received the wrong size drinks. When asked if we could get the large drinks we paid for the cashier was ticked she said "give me back the cups". My concern is with the Covid stuff going on why would they want the cups back? Not that we were trying to get free drinks. Also, why would they be using gloves to serve food and take money and have no change out in between? I am not sure what the guidelines are from the CDC however I'm pretty sure taking drinks back from a potentially infected person and then packaging food and handling money can really spread a virus. Just saying maybe there needs to be some education put out for our restaurant employees/employers if there hasn't already from the CDC. I don't blame the employees, I blame the employer for lack of education and guidance. Hopefully they get this taken care of quickly before more disease spreads.< /Review>

<Review>After waiting 45 minutes in the drive through they said the ice cream machine is not working. I kindly asked for them to clear the drive way and they said they couldn't. So I had to wait to go through the line. They should put signs up when they have a limited supply of food available</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Like I said before McDonald's is McDonald's you get what you ask for sometimes sometimes you have to go back and tell him to redo things most of the time it's usually going back to tell them to make your food hot but once you go back you really don't want the food because you can't trust that they're going to do it right<//Text>

They were having problems with their coffee machine but made it right by giving us our coffee free.  Also, vanilla milkshake had strawberry milkshake in the bottom.  They said that was normal but remade it for us. We appreciated that because it was for our daughter who would've refused it. Our son's cheeseburger and fries was just fine.</Text>

Ordered 2 egg and cheese biscuits.  Total was $8.  Said no thanks and walked out.  The same order is $3.75 where I live.  Looked on the app. This place charged $3.50 for their biscuits.  They are way too proud of their food.  I can sit down at mom and pops restaurant for the price. There was one called Nancy's on the other side of the highway but I didn't try it.< /Text>

I just stopped for a cup of coffee. The line was long and, I could see it was because of the slow staff. At one point, I thought everyone was in a state of suspended animation. Absolutely no one moved a muscle for the longest time. I thought I could help myself to whatever I wanted while everyone just stared into space. Finally, someone's mouth moved and some sound came out. Still, I would never be able to get a cup of coffee here. I figured it would be faster to drive to the Red Bluff location.

My 13 year old (disabled, but ambulatory) son tripped over the curb in the parking lot. As a result, he hit his head on the wall. The McD employees were quick to respond and extremely helpful and quick thinking.</Text>

My mom and me stopped by get food for the kids, as I walked up to order the cashier girl gave me one dirty look and gave me attitude. Someone needs to teach that little girl some good customer service. Besides having the worst experience, their restroom was out of certain items and smelled terrible!<//Text>

Their policy is that you can only have one “free” sauce per order. Well all four people put the order on one ticket (to save them time), she was very persistent not to give us any extra sauce without charging us. Great job at upholding company policy, but not worth a bad review. Food was good!<//Review>< pics>

Skimpy on the food, cashier was very nice and knowledgeable but whoever made the food is an idiot, BURRITOS AREN'T TACOS!!! they should be closed on both ends and folded not falling apart, I want food not a tortilla with a nipple of eggs and sausage at best.

She literally THREW MY CHANGE ON THE GROUND and then she dropped my dollars between the register and the counter as she hurried away and told me she had to get cups. The place was swarming with flies (but that’s pretty normal) and none of the employees were wearing name tags (again, standard practice in this place). The food was very sloppily put together and wasn’t good. I always have low expectations when I come here (you really DO get what you pay for) but even for fast food this place is unacceptable! avoid at all costs!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808305b60cd9f26b:0x101307c320e6a4c6</gmapID></record>

<Review>Friendly staff, helpful in explaining sandwich flavors. Recommended their favorites & why they like those over other menu items. Average in busyness,  from calm to 5-6 cars in drive-thru & 4-5 people inside in line waiting to order.  Service is quick, with your order being ready in about 2-4 minutes depending on if you need to wait for an item to be freshly cooked before you receive your order.</Review>< rate>

<Review>I know this is a fast food restaurant but this place is horrid. Orders are almost always wrong and the most recent time I've never went to the bathroom in one night so many times. They are almost always out of something. Not going back ever....which sucks since there is only like 3 fast food places in Willows.< /Review>< Pics>

McDonald's is like every McDonald's .... this particular one is busy all the time ... great access off Hwy 5... they also offer an app that you can order ahead and drop in and pick up your food.  One thing I noticed at times they don't properly drain oil off fries and/or hash browns ... place is clean, staff friendly, lots of parking space... just wish folks would use trash cans rather than parking lot for their trash.  Easy access roads as well...handicap parking and access.</Review>

<Review>I first ordered online since my sister inlaw is pregnant and my boyfriend was up to going out i decided to go my self so i ordered online and checked in when i got there. So i wated the app said it normally doesnt take more then 5 minutes okay well two cars that i can see in the drive thru so that means there is about two or three cars head okay two or three people in dine in okay cool so it should take about 10 minutes then. Given the fact i use to work at a McDonalds in two diffrent locations and a burger king. So i know how long its suppose to take. So i waited 10 minutes go by 15 minutes go by and then 20 minutes go by and people flooded the inside. You have an employee on break with her man. Giving me dirty looks. Then 3 minutes later another employee brought my food out and handed it me i went to ask for sauce and she ignored me. So i get home it takes 2 minutes to get to my house from there doing the speed limit. And yet my fries were cold and my sandwich was barly warm and the nuggets were barly warm my sister inlaw said they tasted old my boyfriend confirmed that they were old. But i will say the only thing great about the experience was that the oreo icecream was right on. I will not return. I keep trying to give it a chance but its always the same i have had 3 good experience out of the times i have gone in the last 2 years. I dont eat fast food much but when i do i expect it to be what i pay for hot good looking food<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808305b60cd9f26b:0x101307c320e6a4c6</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This McDonalds is way below par. I haven't experienced one that was this consistently bad for quite a long time. They constantly run out of product so you have to check availability. When their frappacino machine broke, it stayed broke for months. Freshness below average. Wrong orders every other visit. Also they are not a "participating" location so their value menu sucks. Also their dining area is very small and uninviting. Thumbs down< /text>

They failed to call my number and argued with everyone about what numbers were called. They also messed up my order by giving me Ranch instead of Barbecue sauce. However, the cashier in training was sweet and tried her best to keep up with everyone.<//Review>

Our window girl Chelsea was sweet so no reflection upon her but every time we come it seems like they're out of something like ice cream, tea and today sprite. Also, order was taken incorrectly and once again great representative Chelsea corrected it with a cheerful smile.<//text>

I visit family frequently up here in Willows but each time I come to the McDonald's here it is awful! I have never seen a menu so limited in my life! Also my husband went to order the chicken strips meal and they told us that they had to check to see if they had the strips! Like what the heck?! McDonald's is a food establishment with this item on the menu you better have the item geez. Wait times are ridiculously long too. If you are passing by Willows, CA keep driving to the next town  if you want McDonald's.<//review>

Double check your order. Still Love their fries, when made crispy. Otherwise their service is always fast when goim g through the drive through. Think it's a little slower when going inside.</Review>

<Review>Honestly - the average McDonald’s, maybe a bit below. Unfortunately closed 10 minutes earlier than advertised and refused to clarify or open the door when I pulled up.

Deeply disappointing, especially since I was craving that Big Mac... maybe check into updating your opening times online?< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I don't think they're gonna make it. "Why did I eat that?" seems to be my first response after my last bite...
The food just feels toxic. Old. Place is never really clean, either.
Yeah, even their fries have dulled.
Kinda sad.</text>

We ordered a 2 double quarter pou der meals plus a big mac meal & 2 cheese burgers & 2 McChicken. Spent & 36.72 for hambergers that were raw barly cooked & the fries were cold. Tried calling restaurant number to let them know about it. But didn't answer even after 20 times ringing, so I had to drive back to McDonald's in Willows. Thank God I don't live too far. When we went in to return it . The lady asked whats wrong & acted like we were not telling the truth till we openes the box & showed her. She said do you want us to make you another or your money back . they cooked another 1 & we left.
I feel they should gave us something else also to compensate our inconvenience of having to drive back again. I will no longer go to McDonald's in Willows to eat. Just a frosty that they can't screw up. I will be calling corporate office to let them know about our experience. Every time I go something has been wrong.<//text>

Can’t even get an order correct, tells you to pull up front where they finish cooking it and then come out and hand you a bag that’s completely wrong. Seriously they think they’re worth $15??<//Text>

I stopped by here after a 12 hr drive from Washington and ordered the #5 Artesian Chicken Sandwich and medium fries. So I get my order within 3-4 minutes, I don't find ketchup anywhere, after trying to get the attention of the staff and looking around the tiny place I realized I had to ask for it at the fron desk, fine, no big deal. I took the first bight of my sandwich and it was sooo dry! It had no dressing and the chicken looked microwaved! I asked the young lady that brought me my meal, does this sandwich come with no dressing? She said "oh we are out of dressing" ~well thats good to know!!  and then she was like it'll be about 8 minutes to get a fresh chicken! SMH!
I paid $8.77 for medium fries!
No thank you!</review>< Pics>

<text>Came in with my daughter to use the bathroom after a 12 hr drive. Staff was harassing us knocking on the bathroom door asking if the stall had any seat covers.  When we came out of the bathroom to grab some drinks for the road we stood at the counter and they had a staff milling around the emty establisgment literally ignored me and my seven year old so we took our money elsewhere. Terrible  customer service here. I can't! Let's train the staff to say," good morning, I will be right with you."<//text><Rate>1< /Rate>< date>

<Text>Was able to get a milkshake at 11:34 pm. Normally no matter what the time they say "we are cleaning it" at other McDonald's haha. The food was normal McDonald's food. Maybe a lil not fresh but think it was due to the late hours and not busy. Window lady was super sweet.<//Text><GmapID>0x808305b60cd9f26b:0x101307c320e6a4c6<//GmapID>< userid>

< Review>
This place (for me) wasn't very packed and our order was to 1 and a half minutes  and the food quality wasn't to great but, there is the matter of this McDonald's locationing... this McDonald's is right next to a black bear diner and a gas station. Its a good location because after a long trip you can fill up your car, but wait! There is a black diner here! However, the food at black bear diner is great and all but I can't afford it right now... well would you look at that a McDonald's is right there! Its much more cheap. So this McDonald's scores on the pricing and locationing just not exactly the food. A good four star for me i'd say.<//Review>

< Review>
My coworker and I have ordered Oreo shakes from this location. Today, the boy taking out order stated that "we never make that, it's not on the menu"...then was smug when he responded they don't make chocolate McFlurry drinks, either. Was difficult to remain civil in the drive-thru.

So, coworker and I suffer through the less fun, non-Oreo shakes. I think that we do not need to give this McDonald's any further business, sadly.< /Review>

<Review>That was the slowest and grossest McDonlads I've ever been to. I've never seen so many flies in a restaurant, they were even in the bathrooms flying around the toilets. Glad I don't live anywhere near there, just passing thru.<//Review>< Resp>

< review>
As always, McD's was top notch. Place was clean and busy with people making orders. The crew was top notch too. No complaints from me.  They worked their little thukais's off.
Like I remember when I worked at a McD's 50 years ago.
Man....Im dadgum old!
I always have problems at McD getting food, do I want egg McMuffin or spicy chicken.  Had my sis along, she solved that, she ordered both plus fries for me.
Those FRIES..... TOO DIE FOR!
The crew was courteous, fast in completing order.
Im of the opinion, they are your foundation of that franchise, they hustle and GET ER DONE!
Hope you pay them better than average. If you didnt have them, you, the owner would be doing it.
The question is. CAN YOU STAY UP WITH THEIR SPEED AND CAN YOU GET ER DONE, like they do.  Dont just sit in the back counting your money, canyou compete with their speed and energy.
Make sure you pay them well, or you will have a high turnover. Give them lotsa carrots, they will pull for you.
Keep them happy, pay them HAPPY, they make you HAPPY, $$$$$.
If not for them, learning and trying your store would die.
A great boss is someone that shows he cares about his employees, looks after their happiness, pays better than the going rate.....they will do all they can to accomplish your stores goal.
Be a great boss, people will remember you well for your kindness.< /review>

<Text>It took 35 minutes to get a SMALL order out, and the staff was then rude about never calling the number. Not only did it take 35 minutes, but the crew could not be bothered to check that the order was accurate to the reciept. It's a McDonald's during lunch time, so I understand it was busy, but 100 more orders were placed and fulfilled by the time I recieved mine. Very dissapointed.<//Text>< resp>

<review>This is the most disgusting McDonald I have ever been to. The entire business needs to be shut done for a thorough cleaning.  There were a million flies on every surface,  inside smelled like vomit and rotten meat. There were old fries all over the sticky dirty floors that looked like they had not been cleaned in months. I went in to get a snack and after seeing how disgusting it was decided on getting just a drink and I hope that I don't get sick from that. This place needs to be inspected by a corporate office because it does not represent McDonald at all!!!</review>< userid>

<text>Stopped here on our way back from Lassen to SF specifically because we wanted to try the Gilroy Garlic Fries (We kept seeing advertisements on our drive to Lassen for the new Garlic Fries).  Unfortunately, they didn't have them.  Apparently, only McD's within a certain radius of the Bay Area have them.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>This place was smelly and had old coffee sitting on the warmers (top of the coffee maker) for far too long. Ordered coffee and had to throw it away it was horrible.
Bathrooms were extremely dirty.
I rolled in around 10pm from a long car ride and was extremely shocked at what I saw.</Text><resp>None< /resp>< Date>

<review>Went there and very busy . I was there long enough to notice how dirty the floors are . Under all the equipment is filthy . Too dirty ,  so I wonder how the food is .  I do not think the food is safe , so I won't be going back until its cleaned up . They need to clean the fountain drink sprouts , everything  needs to be sanitized on a daily bases . I will mention this to others , so they can be aware .< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>
