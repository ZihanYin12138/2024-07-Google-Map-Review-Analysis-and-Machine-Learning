<Review>All Occassion Party Rentals provided my wedding rentals.  Price was amazing and my wedding was beyond gorgeous. I highly recommend them.  My wedding looked like I spent thousands.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-hHZrxfK6NhCSjOE59G1e4k8Vl21_HBX9mpJK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN09WuKaUhwEj2ztt7TzCasHKTUHXJx7pvJbkSC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-QT3y6z9ysW8WJvu_vrbjDIWH_MKUbcbKwii8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

Only thing I would say that is a down side is they charge a delivery fee and then and extra $100 if you need it delivered at a specific time not just their window of 7a-7p.  The chairs and barrels were in great shape and the wedding looked beautiful.<//Text>< pictures>

These people were amazing. They assisted me with a wedding back in March of 2018. It was very last minute and they were able to accommodate my needs and in my price range. I recommend them to my friends and will be using them again. Thank you for everything. Keep up the great service!</text>

All Occasion was very professional and that is the reason I chose All Occasion over other party rental companies.  The service was excellent!! Everything ran very smoothly with no problems.  I would definitely recommend All Occasion to others and will use them again.< /Text>

For my husband and my wedding in December of 2017, we decided to get married closest to my family in Southern California. Our reception was outside, and since it gets cold after sunset, we decided to rent two large outdoor propane space heaters, and two 3' tall pillars for decoration from this business.
The pillars worked fine, because they just stood where we placed them, the heaters, however, did not work at all.
My father-in-law, half of the groomsmen, and a couple guests worked for the majority of the reception trying to get the heaters to work. We called the rental company for assistance, and they said, "Sorry, that's your problem."
We followed the instructions to the "T" to start them, and even researched troubleshooting procedures online--still to no avail. They could not get the propane to flow.

Throughout the reception, we heard our guests complaining about the cold, and most left, which is the last thing a new bride wants to at her own wedding reception.

The following morning, my in-laws took the the heaters back to the rental company, and explained everything that transpired. The faculty at "All occasions Party Rentals" tried to start them and couldn't either. The staff told them, "It's not our problem either" and took the heaters back without reimbursing my Family at all.
We would have not paid if they had not required us to pay in advance as a non-refundable deposit of nearly  $300 dollars.
My father-in-law believes they overfilled the propane tanks which set an internal safety valve from allowing any propane to flow.

These folks gave us terrible customer service, and terrible equipment. They cost us a good sum of money for nonoperational heaters, and ruined our reception.

I greatly recommend you steer clear of these people if you are looking for equipment to depend on, and good customer service.</Text>

I reserved tables and chairs six weeks before my event. I was told they would call the week before to verify. They did not call and when I called them I was told that I had no order. They then began another order and said they had the tables and chairs I needed. I then received an email the DAY BEFORE delivery and was told that the tables and chairs were no longer available. I wish I could give zero stars.<//review>

<text>If you are looking for a warm soup on a cold day this is the best spot to come to. Pho is basically a comfort food. The atmosphere is laid back and the workers are always nice. It's a small spot so there are normally only 2 employees. It ok though cause it's never too busy. The food is always good and that is what matters.<//text>< Pictures>

Food is tasty and the fried rice is delishously unique. It had a nice smokeyness to that I appreciated.  Very home cooked style to the food.  Service could be better, the restroom also didn't have soap and paper towels.  My mother was spooked by that!</text>

Nice place. Decently priced, service at the bar has been good each evening I've gone.
I wish the boba tea came in a bigger size.
Pho is good, fairly generous portions there.</review>

<text>Rude, zero  personality employees which if the food was good one could overlook the nasty conditions and over priced soup. On a serious note, they have questionable handling of food. There are too many of these type of food places to tolerate this. The restaurant business isn't about dumping mediocre food on a plate and having it served to you by jerks, yet they seem to do it.<//text><rating>1</rating></record>

<Rating>3< /Rating><text>This is a very average restaurant. The menu is kinda all over the place...it has vietnamese, some thai, and some chinese mixed in somehow. The restaurant has a nice appearance inside, so don't let the outside of the place make you think it's a dump. Staff is okay, and so was the service.

I got pho with chicken broth, with tofu. For a small, it was, well a small bowl. The broth itself was actually flavorful, better than the other location in Lemon Grove. The rice noodles broke easily though, so that was not the best.</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Good service clean shop items are well displayed. A whole bunch of cookies to try one day. Looks like a really fun place. Also they have ice cream available. Small amount of outdoor seating. Definitely want to go back there again one day and take some friends.<//Text>

<text>I went on a Thursday at around 3:30 and it was closed. I would have appreciated a sign in the window telling me why. The cookies taste good, but they frequently run out of flavors early in the day.
I went back the next day. Still no sign and still not open during business hours. If there had been a sign that first day, I would have called first before going all the way over there.
Also, there was a teenage worker inside bagging the cookies. He had no key and there is only one door. The owner locked him in to bag cookies, but wouldn't let him make sales despite there being a security camera.
What if there had been a fire! Terrible boss!</text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x809ada551282741f:0x6e02c990aebb5c28</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I'm sincerely bummed. I use to love this place, but it's about 30 minutes from home, so I don't get to the area often. I read some recent reviews, and I thought people were being a little harsh and I was surprised. So, being in the area, I went in and I have to say I agree. Where it used to be more like maybe mom's homemade cookies, they seemed more..... commercial?? For lack of a better description, maybe like "corporate cookies". I wanted to sink my teeth in to get some density and texture, and while there was nothing wrong with them (it's pretty hard to mess up a cookie), these were more smooth-ish and .... ordinary? They didn't have much substance. They tasted fine, but maybe like they weren't really worth the calories or the $3.20 for 2 cookies. I might not go back. I might get a better cookie fix from the grocery bakery. See what you think..< /Text>< Pictures>

Usually have good experiences here, but they’re closed for “Columbus Day” - didn’t see any advance notice and Google still has them as “open.”  Please don’t close for a “holiday” that perpetuates one of the greatest lies of American history.< /text>

I'm sorry I do like this place but I had to give only 2 stars because the loehmann's plaza location where I go is all over the place.  I've visited several times to find they weren't open that day,  for what reason? Who knows. Guess I'll be looking for another location<//review>

<Name>Jennifer Palomares<//Name><review>We saw cc on food network so we were so excited. We came for the first time and got a dozen cookies and then 2 bags of the day old cookies. Then my daughter and i each got a cookie sandwich for the ride home but the sandwiches were in these tiny bowls and the ice cream was so soft by the time we got in the car the ice cream was thin and in the bottom of the bowl so we had to dip the cookies in milky ice cream. All for all the cookies we bought....size was good....taste was ok not as good as the grandmas brand cookies but they were ok.<//review>< Pics>

Excellent spot to stop by and satisfy that sugar craving. Great location, staff was very friendly. They run daily specials. The ice cream sandwich had a very generous helping of ice cream!<//review>

This place used to have the best cookies I had ever tasted. Recently visited and their cookies were all individually wrapped and something went terribly wrong! I think they started adding preservatives...</review>

I've been coming here for a while now and I've been training with Amy for about a month and half. I've learned so much from her. Specially when it comes down to mobility. I know when it comes to stretching I didn't do enough of it. My mobility and recovery has gotten so much better! I really enjoy my sessions with her. She is so nice and easy to work with. I love her!<//review>

Every time I come into the gym. Coco, the front staff is super friendly and takes the time to get to know you as a person.
I can’t say anything mechanics about this gym. Highly recommend this gym to everyone local and non-local (it’s worth the drive). On top of that the staff (especially Coco) is always making sure machines and floors are in tip-top shape super clean and well maintained!< /review>

<Review>This place came highly recommended from a friend of mine. I think I need to rethink my workout buddy's.  😆

Attempted to sign up online. No plans available. Clicked all three. Nope! "Sorry, this plan isn't available". If they can't keep up something as simple as an updated website,  how can you trust them to run a professional gym? Today's customer experience was in the toilet with this place.

Had to come back and edit review.

Maintenance fees every 3 months? On top of monthly fees, lock in fees, sign up fees? Over $100 a month for a gym membership? Um! No!</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4naCF11FADhguYMqI7qRy9Ibumcol4C15Ub13=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1582140889597, 'text': 'Hi Darcie, we are sorry to hear of your experience. We appreciate the feedback regarding our website ~ this will be looked into thoroughly.  In regards to the fees- we apologize that this was not explained to you correctly. The maintenance fee that you are referring to is actually our yearly annual fee that all members pay once a YEAR- the first payment is 3 months after your sign up date then once a year from there. We would like to have another chance to explain how much our monthly memberships are- we do not have anything close to $100 per month. We apologize fro the confusion.'}< /Response>< gmap_id>

Love the 5am crew, everyone here is super nice & polite. The gym equipment is well kept & gets cleaned very so often. Just found out that the kida room is open which is great! Coco who is the front desk receptionist is the best! She is very outgoing & her vibe is very contagious. 10/10 ⭐<//Review>

I use to go to 24 but because of the time limit and restrictions, the closest one to me was fitness 19 in brea. I was kindly greeted by the young lady at the front desk, Bryana and she gave me a tour. She was very straight to the point but explained all that I needed to know. You can tell by the way she carries herself and talks about the gym she is passionate about it. The staff here was very friendly and made me comfortable.

I’ve been coming to this gym since September of last year and it has been a good gym to go and get my workouts in. I’ve built a sense of community here and made some gym friends which is always nice. The place is always clean & keeps everyone comfortable and safe. I love coming in at 5am because of Coco, she’s super energetic and creates a welcomed environment,  which is always nice when you’re going to a gym!

From out of town. Decided to stop by the Brea fitness 19 and get a workout in.  instead of sitting in traffic. As soon as I walked in I was greeted in a courteous and professional manner. The gym was clean and had
Plenty of workout stations. The men’s restroom was clean! Keep up the good work!!<//Review>

I haven't been to the gym but I've heard from many friends that it's a great place, and as well, I know Bryana personally, for the past 3 or 4 years seeing her grow into fitness has been incredible, and she is very much and hardworking person, and is very dedicated in what she does and not only but she also wants to see others succeed in their fitness journey as well and that's really great to see. Hope you all have a great day.< /review>

Been a member for a few months now, if you’re looking for a great place to work out for a great price I recommend F19.
The staff is Great,  Bryanna is top notch when it comes to custom service. Overall friendly environment!

I had just started working out at this gym & this lady named Coco was very sweet & nice to me & my gym buddy always saying hi & complimenting us & motivating us to work out hard. Such a sweet lady. Recommend this gym specially because of the hydro massage & the skin treatment machine they have plus where they can check your body fat percentage etc<//text>

I was having issues with canceling my membership, due to COVID and the fact that I moved to AZ, but I was able to call and cancel. Reed was amazing and even helped me out. I loved going to this gym when I lived out there, and I highly recommend it. It’s clean and the worked I talked to and came in contact with were very professional. Thank you Reed for helping me out.</review>

<Review>Fitness 19 was a life saver for me over my winter break this year. I got a 1 month pass and I was very impressed with so many things such as the way they treated their customers and the variety of workout equipment that was available. My favorite part was that all the music that was played was clean and there were mirrors on every wall!

Great place for the elderly and young adults.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1614386196927, 'text': 'Hi Bryce,\nThank you for the 5-stars! Hope to see you\nagain soon at Fitness 19!'}< /response><GmapID>0x80dcd50ed18f0abb:0x870b86dbb6a56dff< /GmapID></record>

I have visited multiple locations, but the Brea Fitness 19 is by far my favorite. The staff is warm and welcoming, specifically Coco- she made my friend and I feel very comfortable to be there, greeting us with a friendly attitude! I will definitely be returning:)< /review>

<Review>First and foremost, I want to preface this review by saying that prior to being a member of Fitness 19, I was at 24 Hour Fitness for 15 years.

While 24 Hour Fitness was an ideal gym for me, COVID hit, and life happened. I am up 45/50 lbs and for someone who was into powerlifting and squatted a PR of 455, being fat and weak is no bueno for me. I was, I’m sure, one of many people who chose not to go to gym due to the possibility of suffering the consequences of catching this life-threatening virus and bringing it home to our loved ones who are or aren’t health compromised but the bottom line is, yes- I did not make good choices when it came to my health.

However, I made the decision to cancel my 24 Hour Fitness membership last year as they were no longer 24 hours open and reservations were to be made for 1-hour workouts. I then signed up online for the $30 membership at Fitness 19 and was very impressed with how avid the young men in the front would clean and mist the machines while enforcing the mask rule. I understand that many do not agree with wearing masks at the gym but for the safety of all myself and gym members, i greatly appreciated it.

I have gone to the Yorba Linda Fitness 19 as My office is there and have to comment about how disrespectful and thoughtless the members and staff are at that location. Cleaning machines prior/after use is something rarely seen from the members there. And masks? HA! You would think that covid doesn’t exist in that part of town. The young man at the front desk is always on his phone and does not clean any machines.

So, after a long hiatus, I returned to Fitness 19 Brea and was greeted by Miss Coco who I have to say is truly the sweetest woman. I look forward to my early morning workouts knowing that a staff member like herself cares about the well-being of all gym members. The members at this gym are far more respectful and courteous than the YL gym.

So there is no doubt when choosing a gym - sign up at Fitness 19.<//Review></record>

They were a good gym for collecting payment which was on autopay for me however when my account was frozen during the covid times they were still charging me despite the contract signed stating $zero charge for me at that time. I’ve spoken with their manager Isaac several times about a refund and left messages for the owner and each time I make contact with Isaac He has told me that he will get the message to the owner and get back to me. I still have not heard back from anyone there about my refund and the money that they took from my account without consent. I am glad I cancelled gym memberships there for me and my family</Review>

<review>Bad experiences happen everywhere, too bad because it can happen to anyone but my experience at Fitness 19 in Brea has exceeded expectations. I've been a member at the community center for over a decade but they closed in March so I joined here. Staff and magement have been friendly and helpful. People are told to keep their masks up unless catching your breath. They walk around and clean machines and there are several spray bottles and wipes to use before and after using a machine. Just my opinion, I have no complaints, will be sticking around for awhile.< /review>< Response>

Have gone here twice and won't go again. Both times I came, no one was at the desk. Neither time did I have a temperature taken. The guy that finally did show the first round didn't know how to use the system for my day pass. The second time no one ever even noticed and I walked right I'm after getting tired of waiting.

Was surrounded by people without masks. Understaffed so they cannot enforce the rules even if they wanted to, which they don't. Even when I tried to clean my equipment, the sprayer was broken.

Employees defended the non-maskers when I brought it up. The second visit the employee was chatting it up with an unmasked friend.

People are strong enough to lift weights but not lift a mask up over their face? One of the employees is pregnant (which one would assume should make her the most vigilant). Ridiculous.<//Text>

I love my fitness 19 gym. Isaac and all the staff  here are always nice and helpful. They greet you as you come and go. This gym isn't huge but what they do have to offer is enough to get and keep you in great shape.

I think the best things that sets this gym apart from other gyms is that despite its being a small gym people always re-rack the weight and wipe down their equipment.

They're always willing to switch with you in between reps and sets and it makes your time at the gym much faster. Plus, I always see isaac and all the staff always cleaning when there are no customers at the front desk. Great experience, easy sign up, definitely recommend it.<//Review>

<Review>I really like this gym. The busy hours, say between 4 and 7, are pretty busy but even then I'm still able to find the machines open that I'd like to use. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There aren't crazy perks that you'll find at a bigger gym but if you are looking for a place to work out with good group classes and just about every machine and apparatus you'd need at a great monthly rate then this is your spot. Suits what I was looking for perfectly.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1559069022686, 'text': "Awesome!!! That’s great to hear Sean!!

I'm not a gym type of dude. But was looking for a good spot to get fit. Fitness 19 in Brea was that spot. Very Clean, laid back vibe with great knowable staff to guide me without "selling" me. Equipment is all top notch with plenty to choose from, so I am able to get in and out in a breeze! I can truly recommend this gym for anyone looking to get fit with out the intimidation of those "other" gyms.< /Text>

< Review>
I bought a membership here in June. My goal was to see if there was any cheaper memberships out there than what I was presently paying at 24 hour fitness. I was sold on the 9.99 package, which is cheaper. However, 3 months later I see an additional charge on my account. I was advised this is an annual "maintenance fee". I was not advised of this at time of sell. If I had known about this I would not have moved forward with the membership because the value and cost at 24 hour would have been better. The only real difference would have been I wasn't locked into a contract. The money alone wasn't the issue, I could have easily afforded to pay for that. I don't like how the employee tried to put words in my mouth and debate what was said at time of sell. A manager did offer to refund the fee for me. They didn't seem too concerned with me leaving the gym and canceling my membership. I spent $127 in other fees to join which is basically now a waste of money. It's a very unfortunate situation, especially because I like working with small businesses. It's more than just the money it's the relationship and the way you treat customers. Very disappointing.</Review>

We love Fantasy 19.  We started a week ago, and love it ! The staff are so nice and extremely helpful.  Great selection of machines. Currently, we're using the treadmills.  Next week,  I'll venture out to other machines.
Oh! After our gym time, we go to the hydro massage for 10 minutes. The best massage I've ever had.</review>

< Review>
They keep this place clean....must I say more? I’ve been to many gyms in the area including the 24 hour fitness next to my house and this gym puts the time and effort to keep the gym clean and well organized and that’s what matters to me in a gym. I’ve been to every gym you can name and many of them have forgotten the principle of cleanliness and how important it is. As you workout you will see the crew making sure the gym is clean and the weights are racked which confuses me as to why other gyms don’t take that time and effort I mean what else is there to do to be honest?

This place is a bit small at first glance but as you workout you will realize the efficiency in space and what machines  and where. You can workout everything and anything at this gym while not worrying about a machine being broken and with the amount of amenities you get at a low price, its worth every dollar spent.</Review>

Good rates, especially for starters. Their yearly gym fee is lower than most. It's not in a fantastic area of town, but it's kept really clean and the staff are nice.<//review>

I purchase the 4 session plan and I upgraded to 8 season plan as my trainer has suggested. After me finishing my 8 sessions.  I was told I had another 8 sessions left and that’s when I found out it’s a month to month charge.  I canceled my sessions that same day and I was told that day that I need to cancel 30 days before my second charge, of course they charge me right away and was not able to get the money back even though I did not use the next 8 sessions.  I was told I was able to speak to the manager Ryder and was no help.  They don’t care of their customer… they care about the money they make with this scam..  I did tell them when I was shown the prices for personal trainer, it does not show you a month to month program, it’s when you sign the contract on the computer and they make you sign on a pad where you don’t see what you are signing. They do this for a reason..  They don’t have that advertised that is a month to month charge just like they advertise the GYM Membership for $9.99 or $19.99 per moth… FYI>>>> Before signing anything from Fitness 19, request a printout copy first and READ it to make sure you know what they are going to charge you.

Watch your statements, they rip you off and then don't want to give the money they stole back to you.< /text>< rating>

The staff here is great! David helps me with all my fitness needs! Very efficient, hard working, and friendly personality that makes fitness 19 differentiate from other gyms. The gym is always clean (unlike 24 hour fitness). If you’re looking for a great gym with great staff, fitness 19 is the one!< /Review>

After being here for a few months, I am very impressed by this gym! It is extremely clean and nothing like the gyms I’ve been to before. It also has plenty of equipment for me. The turf area is also a really nice addition since it has kettle bells and yoga mats provided. Also the hydo-massage is definitely the best way to finish my workout SUPER relaxing!<//text>

Hydro massager, tanning rooms...Nice deal on bringing a friend every time. I bring my daughter and my only concern is they play some really raunchy shows on their TVs that I don’t want my 16 year old to see (Claws) ....People can watch that stuff at home if they choose, not appropriate for the public to be forced to view these types of shows.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Brandon gave me a thorough tour and showed me the equipment, they have all the training equipment I like to use and explained the purpose of certain things I didn’t know and helped me choose which membership plan is best for me, the facility is clean and the people are very nice and helpful! Brandon was able to answer all of my questions, explain the details of each membership and help decifer which is best for me based on my specific needs! I’ve gone to other gyms that just seem to care about getting you as a member but here they are very personable and care about you after you sign up!</Review>< date>

<Review>Dishonest and a Scam - We cancelled months ago, and find 6 months later that they have charged us an additional $3800. We ask for our refund and they offer us 100 personal trainer visits. Going through the credit card now, may have to take them to court. STAY AWAY, and under no circumstances give them your bank account to pay. Watch your statements, they rip you off and then don't want to give the money they stole back to you.<//Review></record>

Really taking advantage of my elite membership. I've been enjoying the various clubs but definitely have to say Brea being the newest club has me in love. Staff is awesome very welcoming of visiting members. Zumba is amazing great workout as usual. And I must say I do enjoy my hydro massage after every workout.</Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I was one of the 1st to sign up as soon as they put up the sign that it was going to lease the building. I work in construction and it's very common to have delays like this when the City is very involved in the process. They change things all the time and contractors make mistakes with that being said it's READY now and well worth the wait everything is brand new and state of the art.I am a 5 day a week gym guy I am very impressed with the layout enough room for everyone. Love the free weight area the staff is friendly and very helpful. Being a member for 8 years of the previous gym there. FITNESS19 has exceeded all my expectations lets give them a break and be glad they brought us locals a gym.</Review>< pics>

Can't wait to see the gym when it's fully open! It's the largest Fitness 19 branch I've seen and will also be the first Fitness 19 I've personally heard of that has showers haha finally! I personally just love Fitness 19 in general because of how honest yet competitively cheap they are. I have full confidence that this will be one of the best gyms in the area particularly because I highly respect and trust Romeo and Angel, part of the staff there. Glad they offer daycare for all the busy parents!</review>

<review>OMG!!!! This gym is BY FAR the cleanest, friendliest & energetic gym  I have ever been to. The employees are extremely helpful and charismatic. I have been a member since 2017, and became close with their current and past employees. and I do not regret a thing!  I used to be apart of 24 and the service is not comparable to fitness 19 brea I want to thank all of the employees from the morning people (JJ and the new girl)  to the closing folks (Jason, Jen, Ian and the other employees ).

I don't really like the fact that there are only so little bumper plates vs. the iron grip plates. Other then that no negative feed back. I appreciate the service.

Front desk people are FANTASTIC.
SO they are the best thing about the GYM. Lot of the Brea members i now see at YORBA Linda 19 which is a great GYM and FANTASTIC MANAGEMENT THE BEST OF ANY FITNESS 19. I HAVE ALOT OF FRIENDS AT BOTH GYMS. BUT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED HOW I WAS TREATED AT THE BREA 19.
ACTUALLY WAS THANK BY THE YORBA LINDA MANAGEMENT BY HAVING PEOPLE SIGN UP THERE.
BUT I give brea 4 🌟 because of there desk people and WEEKEND person which is always cleaning and very polite.< /text>

Still go here! Love the gym and the people. I feel like after being a member here since opening I should update saying it’s a great gym with great people. Can’t wait for new class additions!!

********UPDATED 10/27/17*******************
So after a long delay of waiting for this gym to open, I was going to cancel my family's membership, thinking it would never open. Then, on that same day, Fitness 19 in Brea finally opened!
My husband and I went in to check it out since we waited so long. I do have to say, the owner and her family are absolutely lovely people. They have been very understanding towards the whole situation of the gross miscommunication that took place in pre-sales. They seemed truly sympathetic and were very kind. (A+ on that Customer Service).
Overall, I'm very pleased now that they are open. For now, I'm leaving my review at 4 out of 5 stars because of the built-up frustration that led up to their opening as it could have been avoided if Fitness 19 would have been more honest and upfront when they were in pre-sales. If all that wouldn't have happened, this place probably would get 5 stars off the bat because it is a nice facility and I like being able to drop my child off so I can actually workout. I did a 1-on-1 personal training and it was super great. I may update this review after a few months if the gym continues to uphold the standards that have been set since it's opened.< /review>< Pictures>

Been coming for about a year. Great new(ish) gym with plenty of newer machines with lots of variety, many TV screens & music always rocks! Used to be empty but because membership is affordable, it's gotten busy, however its rare to wait for a machine. Have not tried a group class yet. I would give 4.5 stars if able. A few mentions that prevent a 5 star; womens dressing area is small and awkward, some machines are so ultra close that you can smell your neighbor, seems like some machines are showing signs of wear already and vacuuming shouldnt be done at peak times (girl almost tripped over long cord in walkway). Other than that, its great! :)< /review>

The gym isn't even open yet and the three workers, Romeo, Angel, and I didn't get the chance to meet the last guy, have been extraordinarily helpful. They have shown exactly what this gym is going to be and what's it's capable of. I'm looking forward to being a part of this gym coming in August!</text>

<time>1508013944179</time><rating>5< /rating><Text>Let me start off by saying that like so many people I too signed up and was frustrated about the grand opening being constantly pushed back.

That being said - this review is about the gym and staff now that it is actually open. Most of the negative reviews are about the gym opening being postponed and now that the gym is open I don’t think those matter much.

I used to workout here when it was fitness 1 and I used to workout at 24 hour in Brea so those are what I am comparing it to.

All the equipment is brand new - I have never seen so many clean treadmills. All the standard equipment you could ever want is here. If you are weightlifter, cardio fiend, cross fitter, or class taker they have everything you need. They even have some equipment that I have never seen before and am excited to try.

They put in new tiles in the bathrooms and showers and blew out the tile ceiling and installed industrial high bay lights. They also have a big a** fan in the center of the room. (I am in the lighting industry and the brand is literally called big a** fans) aesthetically it is gorgeous in this gym.

My post is probably much too lengthy so here is my point. It was very frustrating waiting for them to open. I literally called once a week for six weeks. To me it was worth the wait because this is the nicest gym you are going to get in Brea for the price. If you don’t sign up for fitness 19 solely off their delayed opening then I truly believe you will be missing on a great gym.

Also if you actually talk to the staff without screaming at them you will find they are very nice and friendly people.

I grew up in Brea and if you grew up in Brea you know that people never leave this city. Hope to see my fellow Brea people working out at Fitness 19!<//Text>< pics>

I  know the construction and legal side of business is not easy or fast therefore i have not lost my patience.

<user_name>Ian Heidebrink<//user_name><Review>Been to this location alot and just got a membership a couple weeks ago, and after visiting other gyms (golds, 24, la fitness) would strongly recommend this gym because they keep it clean and organized. When it picks up around 6:30pm you can still get your workout in because its not overcrowded and is the opposite compared to golds or 24 hour fitness. Used to have a membership at Golds in fullerton but recently cancled and signed up here for those reasons. On a side note the bathrooms and turf area are both well kept here when i use them which should be expected but not common umong other big chain gyms.</Review>< UserId.>

<Text>Ok so now I'm eve more disillusioned about Fitness 19. I purchased membership in July and paid for that month so I could start accessing the Chino location. I had a horrible experience and haven't gone back. So now I am paying for a gym I can't use yet? Maybe I should just stop payment and stick with my current gym. Why is the owner only responding to positive reviews?<//Text>< user>

I'm not a gym person but due to doctors suggestions I decided walk in and check it out which the lady with the blonde hair gave us at tour then Angel helped us signed up really friendly the only reason why I give 4 stars it's because they're still struggling  to find a good motivated zumba teacher.</Text>

This location is a huge scam!

Bait and switch to the max...

Called specifically about a guest pass.

Once you are there it is a mandatory $10 guest pass.

No customer service at all.

The worker "Angel" has the worst sales experience in the world...

Super awkward

You actually have to help him sell it haha

You guys make golds gym look good<//review>

We will review the process that took place with you and make sure this doesn't happen in the future. Like to extend a pass to you if interested.

I paid 6 months straight up front, does my time start in September?  I have no interest in going out of my way to another location, hence why I bought a membership to a gym right down the street.

I would very much like avoid the hassle of yelling at your customer service people when my "6 months" is up in December even though I only used 4 months of that time due to the gym not being open.

I'm not upset it's taking so long, I'm upset at how pushy and "salesy" your employees were about opening soon and "getting that early discount before we open" yet here we are.

EDIT: I received a quick response and answer all my questions.  Makes me feel bad to have even thought negatively about this place but that's what bad past experience will do to a person. 5 stars!< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1502236491760, 'text': "Koda,\nGood afternoon. We are less then a month from opening. Really appreciate your patience. In regards to your question,  anybody who has registered and reserved a reduced rate for early enrollment will not be charged nor would there agreement start date be before the gym opens. Your case is a little different since you wanted to pre-pay. We typically just do month to month and on those options we don't start billing till club opens. However the same goes for your case. If we open in September which we will, your membership will expire sometime in March depending on opening day.\nHopefully we answered all your questions and we really look forward to seeing you in September!\nKoda, we are now open at 8am today 10/14/17!"}<//Response>< GmapID>

<username>Carissa Montes< /username><Time>1514646450255<//Time><rating>5</rating><review>I love this place! It's not a massive gym, but they have a wide variety of machines, weights, and even a training zone you can use for your bodyweight workouts (which is where I spend the majority of my time)! They have televisions playing all over the place with subtitles while upbeat, energetic music plays over the speakers for their patrons. They have lockers and showers for men and women; a kids room for the parents to bring their children to while they workout; two tanning booth rooms next to the kids room; and two hydromassage tables next to the tanning rooms! They have classes every day (ie. Zumba, PiYO, even Silver Sneakers) and have reasonably priced personal training packages (ex. 2 sessions for $75.00).

The staff is great! Always willing to help, and very kind; a little busy, but they gave great attitudes! This places is awesome, I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a gym and lives nearby. That parking lot can be a bit packed so I recommend walking when you can.< /review>< Pictures>

Not happy. Waited almost two months and still says the same reason "UNDER CONSTRUCTION ...  PROBABLY BY THE END OF THIS MONTH" which I've been hearing since I enrolled. And I was told I can access the other gyms in orange county meanwhile and when I visited the one in Buena park very few times in two months since it is 11 miles from my place, I am still charged with the fee and now I have to wait till it opens to get a refund. Really disappointed and I regret for referring my friend to enroll who is in the same situation.< /Text>

{'time': 1505757849346, 'text': "Anil, good morning. I wanted to personally reach out to you and let you know we have already refunded the month you were charged. Your membership was activated when you went over to Fitness19 in Buena Park. We had originally set your agreement up for No fee's and to start your billing 5 days after we open, however when you start exercising it will activate your membership. Very sorry you were unaware of that. We just want our customers happy. Construction is a difficult time and we do apologize. We are so excited to see you at the end of the month!\nWe officially open at 8am!"}<//Resp>

Awesome employees.  I was visiting from out of town and my car was smelling hot.  They checked and topped of all my fluids, told me what the problem was and didn't charge me.  I definitely recommend them.</text>

Said they could rotate my tires. I waited an hour. Turns out they don't have a strong enough lift for my truck.

The guy should have known before he made me wait. His manager knew.

Unacceptable.< /review>

When you get a basic oil change here, they will vacuum out your car, wash the windows, and fill up all of your car's fluids (minus the gas obviously) without trying to upsell you and convince you that something needs to be replaced. If something does need replacing, they will simply inform you that the part should be replaced and that they can replace it for you if you wish (no pressure!).</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808fba7b7bedeae9:0x20aca911b537d070< /gmap_id></record>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Horrible. I came in for an oil change and also asked if they could look at my AC, which was blowing hot air. They looked at it, said it needed to be recharged, and charged me $120 for the service. 2 weeks later, it was blowing hot air again. Turns out there is likely a leak that will likely require a more extensive repair at a real auto shop, and that the recharge was only a temporary fix. When I called Jiffy Lube about this, they said that they could not provide a refund or any further service to the car, as all they are equipped to do is AC recharges, and are not equipped to even do a real diagnosis of the problem to see whether the recharge would have been the best solution in the first place. So much for their satisfaction guarantee!

I feel that they should have told me from the beginning that they were not equipped to do a full diagnostic of my AC, and that the recharge they were providing might only be a temporary fix. They should have referred me to a real auto mechanic. Instead, they took advantage of my lack of knowledge about car issues in order to squeeze every penny from me they could. I called back repeatedly and asked to speak to a more senior manager. The person on the phone promised to have someone call me more than once, but never followed through. Very shady, horrible customer experience.<//review><user_name>Joshua Lykes<//user_name><response>None<//response></record>

< review>
What a great staff at this location. They are polite, professional, friendly, and quick. This will definitely be my default Jiffy Lube from now on.

They also went above and beyond when I expressed a concern about my car and took a look for any obvious hazards. One major one was found, they pointed it out to me and recommended I see my mechanic immediately.

Thanks to their staff, I have likely avoided breaking down, due to a problem that was much worse than I had thought. (Literally, a small, but important, missing bolt).

I couldn't be happier with my experience at this location.</review>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>I have never been to an establishment with such unprofessional workers.
I have been to this Jiffy Lube at least 5 times, and every time they did something different that I did not like. Once, they left oil on my steering wheel, another time they put Teflon tape on the threads of the oil plug, WITH OUT telling me, ('Cause they started to strip the oil pan). Each time, they always managed to spill oil around the fill cap... The second to last time I went there, they put in too much oil and for the first block of driving I had HUGE clouds of smoke trailing behind me like thick fog.
But this last time, really irked me. Multiple employees were cursing because they had messed up on another customer's car. They weren't even trying to hide the fact that they messed up, and I could hear it in the lobby. I felt bad for the other customers, but in order to save myself and my car, I backed out and left - to which they saw no problem with... I even heard "Well he's leaving...". Damn right I am.

So instead I headed up El Camino to another place where they do oil changes in 9 MINUTES, which had excellent service at a decent price. To say the least, I would never recommend that anyone go to this Jiffy Lube. I would write to corporate, but I have better things to do.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Solid work by the technicians but the employees lacked any soft skills or customer service touch. Will probably go back only because it's local and convenient.<//Text>

<Text>Amazingly generous and professional. One of my tires was running low on air, and they filled it up free of charge, even though I did not use any of their other services. I felt guilty and so offered to pay, but they twice refused. Next time I need to get the oil changed, I will most definitely go to these guys.</Text>< Rating>

Negligently destroyed the car. Would not come back. Had I not parked it immediately and kept driving their error would have been fatal to the engine. They put the wrong coolant in, worse, this is standard practice at quick lube places and something I've seen in investigative reports of other establishments as well. To top it off, everyone involved with the company made damn sure none of them could be held responsible and made sure I never got anything from them for this error.
They do not have coolant for your vehicle. They do not have air filters for your vehicle. They misuse the word 'universal' with regard to coolant and don't know or give a damn if it's actually correct to use it, they'll destroy the car before reading any manual to check. Take it from me.</text>

<Text>Bad experience.  Went in for a full service oil change.  The truck's tires were low when I arrived, so I asked specifically that they check and fill the tires.  I asked if they had done so when I picked up the truck and they assured me that had, and they'd double checked.  I started up the truck and flipped to the tire pressure display -- it has pressure monitors like just about every car on the road now -- and the pressures were exactly the same as they were when I arrived.  They directly lied about performing that service, which is included in the oil change, and as a result I wonder what else they have directly lied about doing.

Will never use them again.<//Text><UserId.>113614809826803567146</UserId.><GmapID>0x808fba7b7bedeae9:0x20aca911b537d070</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This place will skips steps just to get you out the door. They'll tell you they vacuum your floor and it's not done. You still see dirt on your carpet after they release your vehicle. This jiffy lubes in Palo Alto ⁶has gone down hill the last 9 years.< /Review>

My family and I have been enjoying Martin Ray for years and we absolutely love it here! Not only are their wine and pizza fantastic, but so is the ambiance set in the heart of the Russian River Valley. The grounds are gorgeous. If you’re planning a trip to Sonoma county, you should absolutely add this spot to your list!< /text>

What a wonderful winery. We tasted some amazing wines. The wine barrel with a 4 person table in it out in the vineyard was the most amazing place to have lunch in. Wow. If you are looking for great wines, perfect setting and an unforgettable experience, Martin Ray Vineyards is the place to go! Loved it!<//text>

<gmapID>0x80843b81268684cb:0x3b99853832923787<//gmapID><Review>ONE OF MY VERY FAVORITES !!! The tasting room is run by a great bunch! Saddle up to the bar, or, sit in the areas out front of the winery. It's very nice. The wine? Some of my favorite. Years ago, and I REALLY miss this, they would tap a barrell - and - for 12 bucks a JUG (about a gallon) you'd get it right out of the barrel. And - for every 10 you bought (over time, of course) you'd get a free one. Those days are gone, but, it does NOT stop me from stopping in there every once in a while. I miss their Ga-Versta-Meaner, too. Heck .. I can't spell that for the life of me. It was great on a hot summers day. Early harvest - not the desert wine.< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Fantastic venue and great wine.  Not only did we taste great wine and place an order for wines we cannot get at home, our host suggested a great place for lunch just down the road.  It was 100+ degrees when we visited so we didn't order a picnic lunch but had the weather been cooler we would have.  The grounds are beautiful and the atmosphere relaxed and friendly.<//Review>

One of my favorite wineries for wine tasting. Price of tasting is very affordable ($15) and is waived if you buy a bottle of wine, which are also priced well - in $20-$30 range. The best part is that they encourage you to walk around, sit outside, etcetera and they come find you with the next wine in the tasting list. While technically speaking you can do this anywhere, this is the first place I didn't feel like I had to ask. They also have chickens walking around which are adorable, and colorful chairs under a tree facing the vineyard which makes for the most relaxing place to sit and sip.</Text>

One of the best winery experiences from my trip to California. The staff was fantastic and the venue was beautiful. We were told they are adding outdoor games and a bar. Awesome spot to come hang out and enjoy the outdoors.</review>

This is by far my favorite winery in Sonoma/Santa Rosa.
The grounds are to die for. So beautiful and the most amazing wines. I love their Pinot noir and Rose the most. Make sure to try the pizza too!< /review>

Visited on May 13, 2013.  First winery of the day.  Greg was our host and he was fantastic.  He was knowledgeable, courteous, professional and very personable.  We bought a bottle of the Pinot Noir, although their Chardonnay was hard to walk away from.  We learned a lot and went away with a smile.  Would go back in a heart beat and will recommend to friends and family.  They have something for everyone.</Text>

Great staff from the front desk to the assistants.  We love Dr. Addy!  My daughter actually asks to go back to see her and gets excited for her check up.  We feel incredibly comfortable every time we're there.  It is exceptionally clean and also has a play area.  We would highly recommend.<//Text>

Our focus is always the health and well-being of our patients. Whether it is with our practice or another, we are glad your daughter is getting her cavities treated. Thank you for your kind words about our staff and doctor being super nice and on time. We strive to provide the best dental care and best experience at the dentist possible.\n\nWe try very hard to give a thorough explanation of the treatment plan to ensure there is a full understanding between patients, parents and providers. The approach to treatment from one dental provider to another may differ due to different training and personal experience with various patients. These differences do not mean that one provider is right or wrong or honest or dishonest. While it can be confusing when hearing different treatment approaches from different providers we can assure you that our providers are highly qualified and experienced specifically in the dental needs of infants, children, and adolescents. We will always have your child's overall oral health and well-being as our priority.\n\nIf you're open to discussing this further, please give us a call at (559)439-6600 to speak with an available provider. We'd greatly appreciate the opportunity to clarify any confusions you may have regarding your child's treatment plan. Thank you and we look forward to hearing from you."}< /Response>< review>
Took my daughter in when she was 18mo, was told her teeth were great and didn’t need to be seen for another 6mo. 4mo after that visit I began to notice big holes on her upper molar (I brush her teeth every night). I brought her and was told all her molars needed crowns and her front teeth also crowns and root canals!! What?!?!?! I was then given a hospital treatment plan with sedation.

I just took my daughter to a well known family dentist and he only recommended fillings- which he did today within 10mins (no numbing require). My issue with CA Kidds is that in a period of 4mo my daughter went from perfect teeth to 8 crowns and 4 root canals diagnosis. Had they noticed something back in January, I would of requested a “high risk carries assessment” every 3-4mo (and I would of paid if insurance didn’t cover). I would of loved to have detected the cavities at an early stage so sealants or SDF (silver diamine fluoride) to slow down the spread of decay. Not to mention that when I decided to schedule for SDF w this office, Lisa gave me an apt 2mo away- which is pretty far out for preventing spread of decay. Anyways, I’m happy I went with a second opinion, and now my baby girl has fillings and sealants- better treatment for my 2yr old vs being sedated w 8 crowns.

*besides that everyone is super nice (staff and dentist) and there’s no wait time during your apt, but I prefer accurate and honest treatment.<//review>

Today I took in my three year old and one year old for their first cleaning and I was so grateful for how this dental office took care of us. My oldest is on the spectrum and getting near his teeth has always been a MAJOR problem. I honestly had really bad anxiety the whole 40 minute drive we made to this dental office. Let me tell you I would make a two hour drive for this office after our visit today. They really took their time with both my boys and tried their very hardest to make them both comfortable. I’m also eight weeks pregnant so when x rays came up I knew my three year old would be sitting alone. It took a little longer than usual but the much needed X-rays got done. I’m so happy I chose to go to this dental office and hopefully my boys will get to go here for years to come! If you’re looking for a quality pediatric dental office this is it especially if you have a child on the spectrum! Also they offer diapers and wipes if you need them in a pinch at the front desk and they have a changing table in the bathroom. Something a lot of dental offices lacked in our old neighborhood. Amazing amazing amazing is all I can say about this place!</Review>

Everything is set up so efficiently and the staff are all so friendly and nice.  Our last experience was really amazing.  I called in the late afternoon because my son broke his front tooth.  They got us in the very next morning, checked him out and were able to fix it right then and there due to a cancellation.  My son was nervous, but they have such a great way of handling kids, it went quick and was over before he knew it.  They are very affordable as well.  My other son has braces and the communication between orthodontist and dentist is great, I feel like we are always on the same page.  Thank you California KiDDS!</review></record>

<text>Dr Addie and staff are amazing!  Its hard to learn that my kids have cavities and need treatment.  But CA KIDDS is amazing!  They think and provide a lot of services to help their patients remain as comfortable and relaxed in a safe way.  Just to share a few, they offer the child their choice of movie to watch during treatment, they offer nitrous - a big help to my kids to keep calm and least agitated, they even applied single use chap stick for my 4 year old so that her lips didn’t crack during treatment.  I am so grateful for this office and the services they provide!  Thank you and Happy Holidays< /text>< pictures>

<Text>Staff is extremely pleasant, more than willing to give direction or help with any questions one may have and best of all they're all really patient and work really well with my little one who has a tendency to cry as soon as she sees ANYONE in scrubs. So far the waits have been relatively short and the experience as a whole, from TV screens on the ceiling (so children can watch TV while lying down) to toys and balloons, make everything as kid friendly as possible. I would highly recommend this office, especially for "first-timers."< /Text><Date>1559072416785<//Date>< Pics>

Me and my kids love this place.  My 7 year old son had to have some major work done and everyone on the staff was so pleasant, patient and warm to him.  They talked to him, comforted him and made such a big traumatic event smooth as possible,  I'm so grateful.

My 4 year old son who has been deathly afraid of every other dentist we have attempted for him to see was a little leery at first but once again the staff here was great.  They made him feel so comfortable and at ease that he is actually looking forward to coming back.< /Review>

<review>My daughter has been coming here since her the past year. The staff are genuinely amazing. From the ladies in the front to actual dentist. They are so kid friendly they make it fun to come to the dentist. My daughter is only 2 and she is a fan; pretty hard to get a toddlers approval on anything! I HIGHLY recommend California KIDDS!</review>< Pics>

My daughter had a very pleasant experience here, the staff is great and Dr. Jordan is amazing, he is very patient and compassionate explaining everything he is doing in a fun way to lighten the mood. Videos play to entertain you child and keep them occupied, the waiting room has games and fun toys to entertain, while little ones wait their turn. I would defiantly recommend California Kidds to everyone, especially for children who are a little bit more uneasy and unsure. My daughter wanted to go back within the hour that we left 😄< /review>

I give them all 10’s across the board!!!! I had appointments today for 3children and was out in a hour. Great service to the kids and adults. My younger daughter who’s 5 put up a fight but they were patient, coworkers stepped in to assist being  willing to still treat her( when other dentists didn’t want to deal with it )Thank you! . Great way to welcome us into Fresno!!</review>

<review>Receptionist / staff was super welcoming!! Made my daughter feel so comfortable and not so nervous. Quick and efficient. They also give you a tablet to fill out forms on and that was so much faster than the old fashion filling out paper forms. Also it was very clean and organized. Will definitely recommend this place!<//review>< Pictures>

Dr. Evans is all three of my kids’ dentist. He is very welcoming, makes you feel very comfortable and is incredible with children with special needs. He never rushes you, addresses all your concerns and helps put your mind at ease if you feel your child is in pain. I highly recommend him!<//review>

Been a patient here for a very long time. Unfortunately that didn’t matter to the office staff. They didn’t seem to care or go the extra mile for their patients. The staff wouldn’t give me a clear answer and insisted on pointing the blame on someone else rather than accepting their responsibility. It’s important to be transparent with your policies and a little apology does go along way.< /review>

<Text>My son has a lot of anxiety about going to the dentist, so all of our appointments with other providers have been a struggle.  The experience we had at California KIDDS was amazing, the hygienist and doctor both did a wonderful job of keeping him calm and explaining things to him as they went.  They are all very patient and appear to take a lot of pride in what they do.  Thank you!</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x809442cd1cc65981:0xfa4d9fbc8b40977d<//gmapID></record>

Dr.Prieto is so welcoming and excellent with my 2 children.  The staff is great as well.  As soon as you walk in there is a nice kids play area, stickers and during cleanings and procedures there are TVs w movies playing hanging on the ceiling!  I am 36, can I please do my dental work here ?!  The experience here is always wonderful from check in to check out.</Review>

My son is 8 and was TERRIFIED to have any dental work. Dr. Kunkel and his staff were amazing with him! This was our first experience with Cal KiDDS and we will definitely be returning for dental care needs to this office. I highly recommend this place if you have a child fearful of dental work! My son had a baby molar that wouldn't come out and the adult molar was trying to push through which my son described as agonizing pressure, along with infection.  He said he didn't feel it when the dentist removed it! All that's left is for the tooth fairy!!!< /review>

Took my 8.5 month old. He has 2 teeth and I’m a crazy mama but we loved them! Such a smooth and pleasant visit even though my little had been fussy all day. I appreciated the information to help me as his eating changes and his teeth come in. Looking forward to our future visits!< /review>

<review>All 3 of my children are patients of Dr. Evans. My oldest is 16 and he has been a patient since before he opened this location (so many years now) Dr. Evans is an amazing doctor. He is caring, has a great sense of humor, and makes sure all procedures are understood and all of our questions are answered. I wouldn’t go anywhere else.<//review>< pictures>

Dr. Prieto was so friendly and made my son feel so comfortable. Most kids fear the dentist, I know I do and I’m 28. Katie was also very helpful in scheduling Dominik and giving me answers I needed to certain questions. Overall the staff, office, and business conducted deserved 5 Stars.</Text>

My 5 year old had her first cavity filled today and the entire experience was so stress free for both of us. We have been going for cleaning for 3 years now and my kids always love going. Today was our first actual procedure and Dr Prieto and his assistant were so amazingly quick yet explanatory. When we left my daughter said to me “Mom, that was SOOOO much fun! When can I get another cavity and go back!?!?” I’m not sure that’s the outcome they are going for but my daughter felt so comfortable that she actually enjoyed getting a filling. 😆 I hope we are only back for cleanings but I know if we need more fillings we are in good hands!!!<//text>

This was by far the best service and staff that i have experienced,from the check in to the check out. I was a little skeptical at first taking both my 4 and 5 year old without my husband but everything was great. I was able to sit right in the middle of both my kids while they were being worked on and was able to see everything that was being done to them while they laid back and watched a movie. I would definitely recommend to anyone with small children. Thank you Drs and staff for your great service!< /review>

He loves watching a movie in the comfy chair while they work on his teeth. This time he was scared for some reason or another (kids...) But the staff handled it SO well. All the staff and doctors have been absolutely wonderful every time we've been there.< /Review>

Took my daughter here for a check-up due to great reviews.  They offered to give her two permanent molars sealant to prevent cavities.  I advised them NO I was not interested in fixing something that was not broken.  She had a few cavities and we were rescheduled for another appointment.  When returned the second time they refused to mention anything about the sealant and worked on her cavities.  After they were done,  the doctor stated that sealants were used on her two back molars.  I was upset and stated I didn't want those and had refused it at the last visit.  Her reply was "no worries, you are not paying anything out of pocket, your insurance will take care of it."  The point was I didn't want it and it didn't matter who was paying for it!!!  Now all my five children are seeing Dr. Ben Magleby, including myself.  He is located on 2127 Herndon Ave. Apt. 103 Clovis, CA 93611.  DON'T BE FOOL BY THE KID SETTING ENVIRONMENT!!!<//text>

This is the best dentist on the planet for children! I wish, as an adult, that I could come be a patient too! They helped my daughter stop sucking her fingers (which was creating a crazy over-bite). My son had to come for FIVE visits to deal with surface level cavities... and he would get so excited when I told him it was time for another appointment. Excited to get a filling. I see kids cry almost every time I'm there because they have to LEAVE. Kids cry because they have to leave this office. I love it! They speak to my children and explain what is going on, and have lots of fantastic child-friendly toys and activities to help them feel special. They have a wall with photos of patients which is fun to be a part of as well. And, as a children's writer, I right away noticed the high quality children's books available for kids to read while waiting (and the children's book illustration prints hanging on the walls). The doctors are very respectful of my children. I am allowed in the room for any or all of my child's visit. I've never heard anyone scream or a single restraint (I've heard horror stories of other dentists using these methods). My child is greeted personally, often by name, when we walk in the door. So many "small" things that add up to an incredible place. I could go on and on. We LOVE this place and would recommend it to everyone immediately!<//Review>

It only took 2 visits for my now 5-year-old to feel comfortable and confident in coming to his appointments. Everyone in the office is absolutely amazing.</review>< pics>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I took my 21-month-old here today for her first ever trip to the dentist.  We had a great experience.  The receptionist was polite and checking in was easy.  The waiting room is very kid-friendly, so I didn't have to pull out my usual bag of tricks for waiting.  Even the exam room is accommodating with a TV screen on the ceiling for a good distraction.  Her hygienist was so good with her and provided me with lots of helpful information about preventative care.  Dr. Prieto was very thorough, gentle, and good-natured.  It is clear the doctor(s) and staff are well-trained and enjoy working with children.  I could not be more pleased with our experience.  We will definitely be returning every 6 months!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>I was SO impressed with CA KiDDS and Dr. Evans today.  He and Kate made my son's first experience getting fillings totally enjoyable.  My son was very, very nervous about the appointment, never having had work done before.  They were patient, didn't rush him through it, allowed me to sit back in the room with him. He watched a movie and between that and the laughing gas, he was a happy camper!  I'm very thankful to them for a great, positive experience.< /Text><Resp>None<//Resp><userid>100802510276133101750<//userid>< Pics>

< Review>
Dental staff = 5 stars, front desk/billing department = 0/1 star. Went I first got here things were going smoothly . I love the dental assistant and the dentist, they were amazing with my 2 year old. My complaint is with the front desk receptionist and the billing dept. These people were very rude to me and I was in the right. Finally after arguing and having my husband talk to them on the phone , and waiting for another 15 mins, I finally paid my copy and got to leave. They are very updated as far as technology but could use some front end training.
************************************************************
Update: 5-2015
I received a call from the dentist personally apologizing for the breakdown in communication. He assured me that this was an isolated incident but would review it with his office staff personally. I did appreciate the follow up. I am willing to continue to have my children seen here and am anticipating an improved experience at our next appointment.<//Review>

California Kidds was recommended to me by my dentist, and it was the best recommendation ever!  Dr. Evans and Dr. Kunkel are incredible!  They are on the cutting edge of new dental procedures and techniques and masterful at their ability to make kids and their parents feel at ease.  They are patient, kind, and truly care about what they do! If you are looking for a dentist, look no further!  This place rocks!< /Text>

<Review>Every visit is an enjoyable experience. The office setup is perfect! The kids have an area to play while waiting in the reception area & in the back, too! My kids love that they can watch movies while getting their teeth cleaned & i love that, unlike most pediatric offices, parents are allowed to go back with their children. The restroom even had a changing table equiped with diapers and wipes- an added bonus! The Dr.'s are great, the RDA's are great! We love it here!:)< /Review>< Pics>

Dr. Kunkel is fantastic! The entire team are friendly and courteous and the facility is top notch. My eight year old daughter has been to two other dental practices when we had Medical and there was simply no comparison. After going to Cal KiDDS we wouldn't want to go anywhere else!< /Review>

My kids had never been to the dentist before coming here and they did great.  The office is fun and they actually enjoy going.  My daughter had to have some cavities filled and Dr, Kunkle did great with her.  He called and checked in on her later that night because she was sedated.  The next  day she had a sore in her mouth and they got me in right away to make sure it was okay.  Great, caring, fun office and great dentists!< /Text>

I brought my 3 children for cleaning and a dental check up with x-rays today . My youngest son has been here before, but this was the first visit for my 11 and 13 year old. Stephanie, who took the kids back to do the x-rays, was awesome and had such an upbeat and friendly attitude and made an instant and easy rapport with all of my kids. She definitely impressed me with her great attention and level of service, especially with Luke, now 4 who can be a challenge at times. The reason we come here is for Dr. Prieto, who has the best chair side manner. He is the only dentist that my 3 year old felt comfortable with. He has a way of putting kids at ease and is superb at what he does. He is easy going and direct, knowledgeable and easily approachable. His tone of voice, ability to connect with kids and gentle manner are great indicators of his outstanding skill and positive outcomes that we have personally experienced. We will continue to come to California KiDDs Pediatric Dentistry into the future and the two hour drive is well worth the great care my children have received. I highly recommend this office and Dr. Prieto.< /text>

My 2 granddaughters were seen yesterday by Dr Jeff Kunkel for follow-up.  One had a lower front tooth extraction and the other had fluoride treatment with no other issues.  The office staff, especially Ashley the receptionist, was very pleasant and receptive.  I observed her assisting another person over the phone and she was very professional and courteous.  The office has comfortable seating and a small play area for children.  Both grandkids were finished within 30 minutes.</review>

<Review>We are constantly impressed with Cal Kidds! I brought my 3.5year old and my 16 month old in for a double appointment today. We were in and out in 40 minutes for both kids. Super efficient! The front desk staff, the nurses, and Dr. Prieto were all fabulous. I'm excited to try the tips they gave for brushing my kids' teeth. And of course, the kids love getting their token and prize at the end.< /Review><gmap_id>0x809442cd1cc65981:0xfa4d9fbc8b40977d</gmap_id>< response>

After having several negative dental experiences at other Pediatric Dentistry practices in town my child was scared to death to visit the dentist today. I had been told by many of my friends that California Kidds was the place to go. I am so lucky that I listened to them!  My very scared 7 yr old was treated with such kindness by Roxie. It took her a very long time to get x rays and not once did she get frustrated! Then came the cleaning and my child was calm as a cucumber because they were so patient with her.Dr. Evans came and was just as patient and kind. Thank you so much for a great experience. Today we had a dental breakthrough!</text>

My son loves it here and CA Kidds is the only dental office that he gets excited about!  Dr. Evans and the staff made him feel at ease from the moment we walked in.  We've had bad experiences with other dental offices and my son left in tears.  We will only go to CA Kidds from now on.</Review>

The BEST kids dental practice in the fresno/clovis area. Taking my kids there for 3 years. When my 5 year old daughter told her cousin she was going to the dentist, they moaned about about how awful going to the dentist was. Since she has only ever seen Dr Kunkel, she didn't understand why they didn't like it. She enjoys going to the dentist, and has even mentioned wanting to be a dentist when she grows up! The Best!</text>

Ahhh-mazing! I had to take my 11 1/2 month old son in to be seen. He started walking early and chipped one of his lower teeth. :( As soon as we walked in, he wasn't clinging to me like most new places. He saw toys and magazines to play with. New patient paperwork was electronic on an iPad. The area for seeing the hygienist is friendly and open. TVs at each station for distraction. We got to watch our favorite YouTube channel which made him excited enough stand on the table and babble. I was incorporated into the visit to help hold my son so he felt more at ease. We learned how to brush teeth properly. Dr. Evans saw him and was super friendly. My son gave him a high five! He cried to have fluoride on his teeth and to get his tooth filed smooth but only because he had to be horizontal which is currently not his favorite (doesn't want to lay down for diapers right now). There was no sedation needed. Dr. Evans did the filing less than 2 minutes and then my baby was back to normal. We got our name on the cavity free wall AND a token for a prize (ball) which he loved. When we left he waved goodbye with ball in hand! Hands down the best experience for children! Would recommend to my friends and family.< /review>

<review>Love the art book remnants in the basement and the art books section upstairs.  Their selections suggest a very Harvard state of mind... heavy on the intellectual and avant-garde art historical perspectives.  This is the second place I check when I'm looking for my next new good art-related read.<//review><rate>4</rate>< Response>

This place is incredible!!! I went here over 7 years ago when I was pregnant with my daughter and now here today pregnant with my son. I was able to bring my family along for this special experience. Our tech Natalie was incredible. She was so excited which in return made us sooooo excited!!!! Definitely recommend this place< /Review>

<Text>I couldn’t imagine going anywhere else but New Life Ultrasound! I’ve on my 4th pregnancy and have been going to them since my first one! When you walk in you feel at home the staff there is BEYOND amazing and welcoming! The entire vibe of inside is calming, beautiful, and you can’t help but feel at home! This time around i was able to find my gender out at just 8 WEEKS which was so fun and so easy and quick with their gender reveal option, and it was a quick blood draw and i was able to receive my results in just 24 hours! It’s really hard to find truly somewhere that is so positive and happy and comfortable all the time to visit but New Life Ultrasound is the place that never ceases to amaze me!<//Text>< username>

This is my number one go-to ultrasound place! The environment here is so warm & cozy! Dana & Natalie are the sweetest people I’ve ever met. They’re so welcoming and make you feel right at home. Definitely recommend coming here if you’re looking for a special, memorable experience. It will truly be a memory that will last a lifetime! Love this place ❤️<//review>

I've had nothing but GREAT experiences at New Life Ultrasound!  This is my second pregnancy and it was 100% planned and were so excited to be pregnant in general, as well as find out the gender! At just 6 weeks we went to New Life and we were able to see our little bean, we were also able to see the baby's heartbeat! This was so amazing and reassuring that everything was okay so far! At 8 weeks we did sneakpeek clinical test that they offer and were able to find out the gender just the very next day! At 13 weeks we confirmed gender via ultrasound!   Not only do we love Newlife Ultrasound, we also love their staff! Everyone is so amazing, friendly & caring!  There is also an in house newborn & maternity photographer who is amazing!   Thank you Newlife Ultrasound for letting us see our littles before they are here</text>

<text>The staff was super friendly and they were flexible but the pictures didn’t come out well. I would have just let it go and chalked it up to the position of my baby, but then I saw my sister-in-laws photos from this ultrasound place, first child, compared to the picture she got from another place with her second child. The second ultrasounds were much higher quality.<//text><name>Yva S</name><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I did a walk in this morning, and to my surprise they were able to get me right in without an issue. Cassandra was my technician and she did an amazing job. She was so kind and friendly and ensured I had a great experience during my visit. I highly recommend this establishment, will be returning back once I'm further along. Thank you Cassandra, you are an angel.<//text>

My husband and I came in with our family for an HD today and absolutely loved our experience. Not only did we schedule our appointment just 2 hours prior to going in, but the technician was super friendly and patient with our very stubborn little girl, who refused to show her face. She went above and beyond, doing everything in her power to try and get us some decent images. The ones we ended up with looked really good, but she offered us to come back in a few days and gave me some things to do before hand. We can’t wait for our next appointment and will be using Newlife again!< /review>

BEST EXPERIENCE EVER! I wish I had a better memory because I can't remember the techs name but she's a little short brunette with freckles and a killer smile. She's amazing. She had my wife laughing and made her feel very comfortable. She knew what she was doing and just made the experience a great one. We've been to others but this one was by far the best.<//review>

Yesterday when my ultrasound place through my doctors office cancelled on me, I called New Life and they made me an appointment for later that same day! The inside is so nice, and the staff welcomed me and my family.

Sarah the ultrasound tech was amazing! we didn't want to know the gender of our baby so she took all precautions to make sure we didn't see. She gave us as many angles of the baby as she could and explained everything to us. She made us laugh and it felt like we have known her for years.

Ultimately if I could afford it I would come back every month! Highly recommend this establishment to anyone I know!

Thank you girls again!< /Review>

Absolutely loved everything about my experience here. Our baby was shy the first couple times we went in, so we weren’t able to find out the gender. They not only brought us back once, but twice just to confirm that we were having a girl! The girls working here are so nice and professional, and not to mention the entire studio is adorable! Would definitely recommend anyone around the area to go and check them out.<//review>

<Review>New Life was great!  I had a very anticipated doctor appointment earlier in the day and after waiting over 2 hours, (for the second time) my doctor wasn't able to tell me my baby's sex and I was very frustrated. I'm almost 19 weeks!  I called New Life and was able to make an appointment for later that same day.  The appointment went very well and Katie was nice and listened to my frustrations.   We also purchased the scruffy looking teddy heartbeat bear, so cute!  Thank you ladies again!< /Review>< pics>

Good desserts and good value.  The gelato was very tasty and the meringues were good as well.  They don't really load on the toppings.  Place was a bit dirty and the tables needed to be cleaned but they might have also been busy before I got there or they may have been short-staffed.</Text>

This was the most incredible, delicious dessert that I have ever had! Went in to try the meringue because it looked so beautifully tasty in the window, little did i know it was a complete masterpiece! The combination of gelato, fruit, cake, cookie crumbles, and chocolaty syrup was pure heaven! Not only does it look pleasing to the eye, the presentation is magnificent! You must try this!</text>

<Review>My family was visiting from out of town and we were so excited to try out this place for the first time! But we were sadly disappointed by a female staff member immediately.  The four of us were in line to purchase our dessert on Saturday evening  when our  6 year old son stated he needed to use the restroom. We noticed there was a sign on the door stating “customers only”. I followed my son to the door when we were stopped by a female staff stating “he can’t use the bathroom”!  I explained he was 6 years old and we were in line to order.  She was so rude and I couldn’t believe the reaction I was getting from her.  Absolutely no compassion nor people skills when speaking to customers.  After repeatedly stating he was just a kid and the sign says customers only (which we were) I grabbed my spouse out of line and went to the BAR next door!

Hopefully in the future this staff member receives customer service training.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

It’s the concept that’s more exciting than the desert itself. The smoke bowl has everyone attracted to this gem. The gelato itself is average - nothing special, hence the 4 stars but their special touch of adding extra toppings makes it special.

I would love to go back and try different flavors. Loved it !< /Text>

I enjoyed "building" my own dessert on the iPad then watching it come to life as the food serves prepared it. I ordered a banana crepe with chocolate and white chocolate pearls, and it turned out well. I enjoyed it. My husband created a sundae of sorts. Though both were tasty, the price just turned me off. $30 is a bit much for a crepe and a sundae. For us, this is "one-and-done" type of experience.< /text>< user_id>

< Review>
The dessert was very fancy. We ordered one with liquid nitrogen on the side. The outer cover was crunchy and the gelato inside was tasty. Went with the chef's choice and was not disappointed. Also placing the order was really convenient. They had tablets placed and you can order on your own so no waiting in the lines.<//Review>

Definitely a unique experience, and incredibly indulgent! Seating is very limited due to Covid-19, so be prepared to take your ice cream treat to go. Don't skimp, though! Go all out and get a little bit of each layer. It'll pay off in the end.<//Text>

I loved this place! They have crêpes, milkshakes, gelato, sorbet, big meringues as crusts, etc.  You can build your own dessert!  With the ipads you make your order and then you can watch them prepare it. It is very cool and fun to use the ipad to customize your own dessert; the software is user friendly and walks you through each layer/step.
We ordered a vegas bowl, which has a smokey effect, and a sundae. They were delicious!! I recommend you think about each ingredient, for all of them to go together nicely.
As a negative, it is expensive and they use a lot of plastic.<//text>

<Review>Really cool stop in San Diego. The dessert was easy to order and was fun to eat. It also tasted really good! All you do is walk up to the kiosk and order. They have different types of desserts, so you should find something you will like. The meringue is something you should try and it is a lot of fun to eat and crack open.</Review>< rating>

Went to iDessert while on vacation in San Diego. Located in the Little Italy neighborhood, this spot is just a stones-throw away from numerous amazing places to eat. Once you're done with your dinner, definitely save time and room for this place.

This place let's you build your dessert from the ground up. Choosing the different flavors of the cake, cream, and the meringue shell. Top it all off with the Vegas Bowl add-on. It doesn't add anything to the taste of the dessert, but it sure does look cool.< /Review>

And I have great news for the vegan people or those that are allergic to the lactose: there are vegan options so you have your sweet moment and your cheat day in here.
The location is perfect is just located on the main street of little Italy. The only but thing is to find a parking spot good luck
And it is really technological you can order in advance
It deserves the try<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKYlPNzW8vofsJX5DBKgfJ44BzBXP9cValTCV6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJCIi-eWcnRSPAactpdQHOBmtxvJkIJW09i3ci=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvLAtUji-64WKBwByBBIJQDf-MkQt9e22EH6ab=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPL_tcYNk-vdMWCMDDscqvQHSudVHVvBGd4vNJb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Gmap_id>0x80d954ade8509183:0x41d2892bb54ff788< /Gmap_id>< response>

<Text>Very fun place to come make your own custom desert. Be careful and think about what you are creating so it goes together if you are trying it for the first time. If you do create something it can be very delicious to your liking. The ice cream desert are very different from other ice cream sundaes you get other places. You get to pick out your flavor shell, and other fun flavors to go inside. Don’t be afraid to ask the staff for help. If I’m in the area this is one of my favorite places to grad a desert, the experience is wonderful. They also have creeps here to and you can add your favorite toppings as well!<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>The idea of this unique custom dessert is interesting. You can pick all kinds of toppings for creating this multilayer multi type dessert in one.  However, I find it a bit overpriced for the portions you get.  Nevertheless,it's worth visiting once because it's unique as created by the famous Jean Philippe.</Review>< Pics>

<rating>2< /rating><Review>We went in for coffee, my partner and I, and the two working didn’t listen to the order, as I said two with mochas with an add shot, Almond milk and whip. The coffee was burnt, either the milk was too hot or if they added water I am not sure, it tasted watered down. The mocha was so hot the lid would not snap on and I could not drink it without burning my tongue. Maybe the ice cream is okay but not the Coffee drinks are subpar.<//Review>< pictures>

Good pizza and they even have Mexican style (cane sugar) coke here ... on tap !!

We ordered pizza and soup. Location is great ... is on India street, right in the heart of Little Italy (San Diego). Great outdoor patio that lets you  people watch and you will see lots of tourist trolleys and go-karts go by.<//Review>

<Review>Definitely a unique experience, and incredibly indulgent! Seating is very limited due to Covid-19, so be prepared to take your ice cream treat to go. Don't skimp, though! Go all out and get a little bit of each layer. It'll pay off in the end.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80d954ade8509183:0x41d2892bb54ff788< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Where to start. First, I'm never apologizing for those calories. It was worth every one and I WILL do it again. Second, ever get frustrated  wondering what dessert to have? At idessert you can have them all! My custom dessert was literally made of meringue, candy, gelato, cake, mousse, sauce, and fruit. Heaven at it's finest. If you're wondering where to indulge, STOP! And go straight to idessert. You won't be disappointed. It's more than just dessert. It's an experience.</text>

<review>Good place for a quick dessert.

Amusing to assemble your order via iPad.

Choose a number of options and wait for it to get made.

Very fun place to come make your own custom desert. Be careful and think about what you are creating so it goes together if you are trying it for the first time. If you do create something it can be very delicious to your liking. The ice cream desert are very different from other ice cream sundaes you get other places. You get to pick out your flavor shell, and other fun flavors to go inside. Don’t be afraid to ask the staff for help. If I’m in the area this is one of my favorite places to grad a desert, the experience is wonderful. They also have creeps here to and you can add your favorite toppings as well!</Text>

Cool spot for crepes and meringue ice cream desserts. Plenty of options for building your own dessert as well. The process is streamlined and straighforward with tablets so there's no fuss.< /Text>

Pretty cool place, I liked the fact that I got to order from an iPad since it was our first time and it guided us through the process. The one thing that wasn't obvious to us was that we could order from the iPads, we stood around waiting for the cashier to pay attention to us and then she finally said we had to order from the iPad. Maybe there was a sign that said that? We didn't find it though 🤷🏽‍♀️. Besides that the "ultimate experience" was really yummy and great for IG pictures.</review>

Cool dessert.. order on your own on their iPads. The program takes you step by step through the process of ordering. I ordered a hazelnut crust with crushed hazelnut, pistachio ice cream, chocolate cake, fresh strawberries surrounding the bottom, caramel sauce squirt ball, and Vegas style presentation (smoking effect).. i think the total was around $9.50. I especially enjoyed the hazelnut crust/shell, which was a meringue shell. It was light, and not overly sweet. It was not an out-of-this-world tasty dessert, but definitely fun, esp with kiddos.</Text>

The ice cream here is delicious and you can customize your dessert however you want it. You order it on an tablet and you can choose and see what you are adding to your dessert. The place is always clean and the staff is nice.</Text>

This is a cute place to try out just to say that you have been there and tried it. Its very pricey. And honestly I probably wouldn't go back. The set up is really cute though Im not gonna lie. But personally the meringues aren't all that. Its just a show especially the vegas bowl. They charge extra to put dry ice in the little bowl to make it look like smoke. What you get is not worth what you pay for in my opinion. I bought 3 desserts and paid over $30.</text>

The perfect dessert! create your own by a very cool idea!!! Like the meringue shape and the overall taste is really awesome!
Too bad it's only found in San Diego. Looking forward for a branch in L.A too</text>

<text>It's more a novelty that you are paying for, and it feels expensive for dessert.

It is novel because of the meringue cover and the way the syrup was presented in a lollipop like plastic tube.

You get to pick and choose your own dessert via an iPad kiosk.</text><resp>None< /resp><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7xl4qQqRQYUJ-JULF3I07p9BLIo7WYAyujfqi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< date>

Where to start. First, I'm never apologizing for those calories. It was worth every one and I WILL do it again. Second, ever get frustrated  wondering what dessert to have? At idessert you can have them all! My custom dessert was literally made of meringue, candy, gelato, cake, mousse, sauce, and fruit. Heaven at it's finest. If you're wondering where to indulge, STOP! And go straight to idessert. You won't be disappointed. It's more than just dessert. It's an experience.</Review>

This place is for millennials. You walk in and place your order on a tablet. There is a person that will help you out. They have a few professional pastry chef in the back. It was an experience of a lifetime.<//Text>

<Review>The meringue shell was exquisite!! Build your own unique ice cream and shell, and "break into" it for the full experience. Great for dates, and no waiting line like Salt and Straw... 10/10 would recommend.</Review></record></dataset><record>
<Review>Good pizza and they even have Mexican style (cane sugar) coke here ... on tap !!

We ordered pizza and soup. Location is great ... is on India street, right in the heart of Little Italy (San Diego). Great outdoor patio that lets you  people watch and you will see lots of tourist trolleys and go-karts go by.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaakSPr2le-xv_MkXbWHlvbYGMrdSWIV2COOU4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgscEToHb3Ye0GIvikts1Tmcyrc1THznLTyIsY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< name>

<Text>This place is very busy and hectic, with the dessert pickup not exactly having a great setup to wait for your dessert or ensure you get the right one. But that was my only issue with the place. The desserts are pricey, but lots of fun and tasty. The Vegas Bowl is just placing your dessert in a bowl with dry ice- great for pics or kids, but no other added value. There are plenty of flavour combinations and everything tasted great, so it was worth the madhouse.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

It's a new cool dessert place where you can customize your dessert by using an iPad menu. There's someone at the counter to help you if you bed help though.

The have soft serve ice cream sundaes, shakes and a specialty dessert with different layers you choose including cake, fruit, cream, gelato and a meringue topper and syrup. You can even have it in a bowl with dry ice and water to give it a visual pop. Pretty cool if you ask me. Fruit is essential or else is just a sugary mess.</Text>

Fascinating dessert concept. The custom options add up to an almost $10 dessert, but you're definitely paying for the experience and novelty. The endless possibilities of flavor combinations will keep fans coming back for sure. For those who are less adventurous, you can also create your own milkshake. The ordering for everything takes place on an iPad, but the staff is very helpful and friendly. Limited seating.< /review>

4stars because i felt the price was a little high.

And then there is the flavorful deserts. It is definitely an explosion of flavor in your mouth with every bite.  I highly recommend!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>I had the ice cream and it was really good. I decided to pass on the smoky effect that they had optional because the ice cream by itself was already pricey. I’ll definitely recommend this place to someone who has never had their ice cream if not for anything but for the experience.< /text>< Pics>

Desserts are overpriced, but nice to photograph for Instagram. You order on an iPad and can choose how you want your meringue to be made. Simple options for cake, sauce, fruit, filling. Nice place to visit once, but there are better dessert spots to visit. There's also an option to have your dessert served in a bowl with nitrogen for $1.50 more...Waste of money. It looks cool for about 5 seconds, but in the process it melts your ice cream and turns the plastic bowls hot. Caution around kids is recommended if you opt for the Las Vegas meringue bowl.</Text>

<Text>Very tasty, to small for the price. Very crowded inside. They need to have a better process for calling out the names on orders. The fact that you order at the tablet is good but when you confirm the person picking up the order you should verify. Someone took my order and then I had to wait for them to do my order again.</Text>< pics>

They have a lot of options of ice cream, toppings, meringue, etc. Again, a bit much for me but they had a lot of people in the store. It’s great for kids too.

The team that works there is very nice and helpful.<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< Date>

<review>Quite an ingenious concept, I must say. The "iDessert" itself I'd say was just "pretty good" in terms of overall enjoyment, but you really go here for the experience. My 12-yo son loved it. You know how kids love to micromanage every aspect of their sweet treats -- well this place hits the "sweet spot" on that for sure. They have an iPad ordering system that walks you through each layer of the creation -- and there are several -- so by the end you really feel like you've created something unique. Even if you choose chocolate for just about everything as my son did!<//review>< pictures>

<text>Oh my gosh! It's was so good, I was hanging in San Diego for a Mexico trip and I stopped in because a friend of mine recommended it to me. It was the best experience I've ever had. There's a lady there with a donut tattoo on her elbow who is super nice! Plus super good eats so, why don't you stop in if you find yourself in San Diego, California.</text><name>Caleb Bennett</name><date>1531969521106< /date>< gmapID>

<Text>Walking in, and you can already tell it’s gonna be super good. This is a very clean and well designed place. Whoever Jean-Philippe is, I applaud. Everything I tried was amazing, the Vanilla cake and icing is one of the best I have ever had. I feel like I will be going back for a lot more than Vanilla.< /Text><rating>5< /rating>< Resp>

If you're calorie counting don't come in here.  You can easily get in trouble at this place! This place is packed but luckily they have about 6 iPads where you can order and pay.

Their desserts come quick and were pretty spot on but it's not cheap. Their passion fruit shake was very good but next time I would opt out of their toppings. They use dry ice for a great show with their meringue shell desserts and worth the experience.<//review>

My son loves iDessert. The ordering system is user friendly and unique. You must try a Vegas bowl if you are a first time visitor. The sundaes are wonderful too. The place is extremely clean and the free water is a nice touch after you've had a sugary dessert.</text>

<review>Walked here from the other side of downtown and had to wait outside in the heat because they opened late. When we got our dessert we didn't get the dry ice smoke like we ordered, so I asked her about it and my only option was to pay for a new one. So unhelpful and it ruined my experience and my sons. Never coming back unless somebody helpful can replace the dessert that I paid for with the one i actually ordered<//review><rate>2<//rate><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

It's not MY favorite place so I can't give more than a three stars... but it is cute and hi-tech on how to order the dessert(it's done through a Ipod). I thought was neat and very easy to find parking in front of the place.< /Review>

Five stars for creativity and friendly crew. Three stars for the confusing menu. I would have enjoyed a waffle cone, but only saw them after I ordered a merengue on the computer menu.< /text>

30 minute wait for undercooked pancake. Member of staff cooking them was insanely slow. Staff didn't seem to know what they were doing. Avoid.</review>

<review>what do unique idea this is, start with when you walk in it's a pop of color eyeliner Andy Warhol. to your right are a banquette of kiosks, all electronic which prompt you to order your dessert through a number of options including milkshake, dessert, cake and gelato. from there you choose and then you add your toppings your cone or meringue in this case your name it's paid for and then you pick it up from the counter. very 22nd century. The meringue on the other hand is billed as the world's lightest meringue and it certainly was and that it's baked for 8 hours, these are egg yolks and I said 8 hours. they are delicious half domes of deliciousness.< /review><user_id>110615018808750865886< /user_id></record>

The presentation is mostly what you're paying for. I would go back with a visitor from out of town, but not just for myself. The taste is good, but not what makes me want to go back. Don't get the volcano bowl thing, its not really worth it. It doesn't affect the dish at all, it only makes some fog/mist that pours out of the side of the bowl; its cool for a picture, but not worth the extra money at all.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>I think this place is definitely a cool concept. I had great help from the employee on how to use their iPad to order and what flavors/combinations she recommended. The nitrogen fog coming out of my dessert was pretty cool and the dessert overall was great. However, the price and novelty definitely wears off after the first try and is probably the reason I will not come back.</text>< Pictures>

Terrible service. I waited for 10 mins trying to pay with cash before I was told to use the kiosk. I asked Maribelle if she liked working there, and she simply stated not with customer like you. I was very offended and lost my appetite. Then promptly asked for a refund.<//Review>

It was probably the best dessert I've had in a long time. Ordering through an iPad also makes it interesting. I ordered a sundae but they have other desserts that are just as cool.</review>

<text>I would give this clean dessert shop a higher rating if I could, it's that good. The set up is very user friendly even for technologically challenged people like me. You can design your own dessert on a computer screen there and then watch them make your dessert in front of you. We both had their speciality dessert with several fillings. Sooooo tasty and unique. We loved this place and will return. Pricing depends on how much added ingredients you add. We added everything and each cost about $10, but so worth it. You can get cheaper. Design shakes, sundaes, crepes, etc. Looking forward to bringing friends here.</text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80d954ade8509183:0x41d2892bb54ff788<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Fun place where you can make your own desserts, crepes, or sundaes. The IPads are easy to use and they have one lower for short folks, kids, or those in a wheelchair. Clean and bright. The cost seemed a bit high for an every day treat, but for a fun occasion or a first date it's perfect. Get the dessert "Vegas style" for dry ice and a cool effect.</Review>< Pics>

They have no sign letting you know to order at the kiosk. The staff do not let you know even if you wait 20 minutes. And the worst part is the staff were very rude that is totally inappropriate. If this place goes out of business I would sleep better at night.</Review>

<text>One horrible staff member made me and a whole line of people wait at least 10 mins before she said that we needed to order on kiosk. Which I later found out that the young girl working on whatever she was doing did not want to take my order. I think she had something against me, I don't know. After I had a frustrating time ordering on the kiosk, I ask the girl that didn't want to take the whole lines orders if she liked her job. To which she replied, "Not with customers like you." I immediately left infuriated not wanting to explode on her and cause a scene. I come back later and just ask for a refund because I don't trust her making my food. Good day.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Such a great experience there! Tasty desserts for sure but it was the customer service that has won me over. They ran out of crepes so we had to order something else which they messed up on. Ended up giving it to us for free and have us a crepe once they were ready. Will definitely be back again!<//Text>

Cool concept, but price for build your own adds up quickly. Banana shell with mint ice cream and vanilla cream was a good combination. Sauce looked cute (alien bulb thingy), but not worth additional price in terms of flavor.< /review>

Very interesting idea for a dessert place. I tried a couple of different combinations and they were both great. The Vegas Bowl (steamy dry ice thing) was a bit pricy at around 12 dollars total, but fun for a once-in-a-while treat.</review>

<Review>Cool concept, but price for build your own adds up quickly. Banana shell with mint ice cream and vanilla cream was a good combination. Sauce looked cute (alien bulb thingy), but not worth additional price in terms of flavor.</Review>< response>

<text>There was just a strange vibe in there. Ordering from an iPad and having little to no guest interaction was weird. The employees don't seem to be really happy even with the fake smiles , everyone was all so quiet. Its just average quality and way overpriced. I should have just stayed in the huge line at Salt and Straw !</text>< pictures>

Loved 10/10 the meringue was awesome and the passion fruit type sorbet was the best sorbet I’ve ever had. Get the Vegas bowl if you want the experience- don’t get it if you want to save 1.50<//Review>

Very cool and trendy place. Desserts are made for pictures, unique, and is perfect for those from out of town.  May not end up being your favorite dessert of all time, but you can't be unhappy with the result.  The options are plentiful, and the gelato is delicious.<//Review>

Good service. We got parking up the block Sat night at 11pm. I had heard about this place and their iPad ordering system.

The desserts are good, fun, and nice to photograph. But def on the small size for $10.50 or so IMO.

The shop is fun. One iPad was missing. The area is nice to walk around and check... it was good to see Little Italy.</Review>

The deserts are novel and tasty, but they are also quite expensive. It's a nice one time treat if you're already in the area on foot. If you expect to drive by and park, forget it. There's never any parking in the area.</text>

Desserts are delicious but the presentation is really not eco friendly—double layered plastic bowl to accommodate the dry ice, with a plastic lid, a plastic syrup applicator, and individually wrapped plastic utensils to enjoy it all with.< /Review>

<review>The wife brought me here for our date night.  The place was pretty awesome.  I'm not one for upscale dessert places but it was cool to place an order and pay on the iPads and then grab a seat.  Moments later your treats are ready.  My wifey had the berry crepe and I had milkshake.  Tasty.  I'm not daring as you can tell by my order. But the macaroons looked amazing and delicious.  There were a lot of things we wanted tontey. But didn't have time for.  Definitely going back though.</review><Gmap_id>0x80d954ade8509183:0x41d2892bb54ff788</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Definitely a unique experience, order custom through the ipads, as you add the toppings can definitely add up, +$1 or $2 each. Our dessert ended up being like $8. Opted out for the las Vegas bowl but that was definitely an experience seeing another customers.</Text>

Interesting concept. The "i" is coz technology is used to order. They have Tablet kiosks to place the order. Along with the usual choices of icecream and shakes (which you can make your own with any add ons) they have crepes and meringues which are the choices youmay want to try coz they are unique. It is pretty prices. Every add on is charged more than a dollar. You could end up paying 12 bucks for a small size crepe. Still not bad for the one time experience</Review>

It simply tastes like the future.  Perfectly balanced soft-serve gelato and futuristic meringue shells; this place offers the best of French pastry and the worst of French product names.  If only the would ditch the whole app sillyness and allow people to experience their product and service more directly<//Review>

I highly recommend this place! The concept was great! The staff was very friendly and the place looks so chic and very pleasing to the eyes! Boyfriend chose this place when we were looking for a dessert place. I didn’t know what this place is or what it was offering, until we arrive! And my gosh! As soon as we walked in, I feel in love with the place! ❤️

There was not a lot of people when we went here as it was raining. There were actually only two couples inside. We went to the front because my boyfriend and I were clueless on how everything works, the staff at the register explained everything well. We chose to customize our own dessert so we went to one of the iPads on the wall. We chose meringue because this is what they are really known for! They offer a lot more kind of desserts like cakes, shakes, etc.! But my boyfriend and I wanted to try the meringue. They have 16 different meringues, all were handcrafted and looks so pretty! The customization process on the iPad was so easy to go through, it was user friendly. You can always go back to the previous step if you want to change something on your order before submitting it! After submitting our order and paying it on the iPad, the staff at the front had immediately started making our customized meringue!

The wait time for our meringue was not that bad, I think we waited for like 6-7 minutes before we were called. When we finally got our order, my boyfriend and I were both excited for it! The taste was heavenly! It was so good! We both enjoyed it so much! The dessert is not only pretty, it was also delicious!</text>

Cute concept, but I didn't care for the texture of the meringue for their signature dessert, which is the dominant component by far. Sure, I could have ordered a sundae instead, but if I'm going to do that, it'd be at Ghirardelli a few blocks away.</text>

Just uneccessary. Nothing amazing. It's just a new way to grab ppls attention. Not only that but the girl gave my friend the wrong order. My friend started eating it. And then when they found out they made a mistake they gave her such an attitude for taking the wrong dessert. Even tho they're the ones that made a mistake. Was the worst attitude ever. Then the French owner came and gave us her smug look too saying just take it take both. Wth honestly not worth it</Review>

If someone says they have just seen a smoking saucer you may think of an UFO,  and this is definitely an out of this world experience. Jean Philippe Maury has created an out of this world concept, mixing a beautifully decorated meringe, gelato, some science and warm exquisite flavors. The order is placed in a tablet where it gives you all options and in 1 minute you create your own dessert, then you wait patiently and  within 5 mniutes your smokig cold and hot saucer is wating for you to burst in flavors. Hot, cold, sweet, acid, what else can you ask for .... yes delicious and beautiful !< /Review>

I found out about this place just walking through little italy. I remember being drawn in by their interior design and unusually placed ipads at the counter. There was a case on the wall that was filled with these round things (crust), so I wanted to see what it was all about.

I built my own dessert. It's an innovative dessert concept- you pick a crust (16+ to choose from), and pick a gelato/sorbet to go in it. You also get to pick a cake (5 flavors), and a cream, sauce or fruit to go with it. If you want to be extra fancy, you can get the vegas bowl to have that dry ice effect in the photos.

I went with a coffee crust, mocha gelato, spiced vanilla cream, vanilla cake and some caramel sauce. Clearly I was going for a coffee/chai kind of dessert, but I loved it! The vegas bowl adds to the coolness factor - it's just so out of this world. It's definitely a game changer in the san diego area, and the possibilities are endless!

Writing this review just makes me want to go back - it is pretty pricey though. Depending on all your add-ons, you can easily spend $10.<//Text>

iDessert is a fancy made-to-order gelato dessert place created by famous chef Jean-Philippe.

You create your dessert with an ipad. You get to choose your meringue shell, gelato flavor, whether you want cake, fruit, and cream flavor. If you're feeling extra fancy and plan on instagramming your dessert, pay extra for the dry ice so you get that cool effect of a fog.

It looks cool, but I thought the dessert was okay. I wasn't a fan of the meringue shell. The gelato melted too fast. The dessert as a whole wasn't anything mindblowing. For me, it is a one time experience kind of place.

Place is small. They dont have enough tables. It sucks if the place is packed because this isn't the type of dessert that you can grab and eat while walking.<//text>
