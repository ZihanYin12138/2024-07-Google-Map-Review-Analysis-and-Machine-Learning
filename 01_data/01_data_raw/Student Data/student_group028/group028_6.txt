< Review>
NOT AS ADVERTISED.. We placed a reservation weeks ahead of time from their website for which showed a really nice 15 passenger van, we see them riding around in our area so we thought we were getting a nice deal on a nice van. They called the day before pickup to let us know they only had a 12 passenger van, I thought it'd be ok until we saw what they offered..(pictured) dont rent me a pretty and spacious van on your website and offer me a minivan on the day of...not cool. Not professional at all. This van is what a 2012 model? SMH..< /Review>

<rating>3<//rating><text>Enterprise has been our go to company for cars for years...we utilize the company every year for our road trips. At times we need a car for a few days up to a month depending on our plans. The cars are normally acceptable for cleanliness, but this last rental especially during this pandemic was pretty disgusting especially the smell. The car had over 27,000 miles on it and the upholstery was pretty dirty from the smell of sweat odor. We advised the staff of the issue, which they said they would address. Otherwise, no issues with the car. As the U.S. opens up...Enterprise should be keeping their fleet cleaner during these times.<//text>< pictures>

Enterprise delivered the car to the Thermal / Jacqueline Cochran airport where I picked it up and dropped it off.  The service and the car were flawless.

<Text>As far as the vehicle, it was top of the line...BUT we received it uncleaned, filthy which was not acceptable but it was the only truck in site and half of a tank of gas which I got charged at the end for 3 gallons of gas. With the current COVID virus I can't believe we had to wipe the vihicle clean on our own....And it definitely was filthy plus it smelled like there was a smoker before us...very disappointed in this rental...< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Recently I was in a traffic collision, via no fault of my own. A youngster with no license decided it was a good idea too borrow the family vehicle. I was directed via my insurance to visit a local enterprise branch, and was recommended to visit the Indio location. “Kayle Jones”, and the staff went out of their way to ensure I had a phenomenal customer service experience. Because of previously listed reasons: I will ensure that my friends family hear about my great experience. In short, they understood the traumatic situation and went above and beyond to make sure I could return back too my normal routine. Hence forth, I am now a loyal enterprise customer.</text>< Pics>

We were waiting outside on 110°weather we could not come into the office because of CoVID-19 not even one customer inside the office! Anyway they brought the cargo van at 12:15 and it was very dirty from the windows and dusty from inside, when I told the agent he said it wasn't dirty that that's just how the windows are, and when he touch the window the dust were his fingers were came off. I Was just like Really!!
I felt very upset that I was looking at the dirty van and he was just lying to my face.  And the worst part is that it was the manager who was taking care of my rental, he was just plain careless!

Most experiences are fine, however their cars never have a full tank of gas. If you are going any distance you must fill up before. In addition you need to bring it back with the same amount of gas it had. Very difficult to gauge 5/8 or 1/3 of a tank, so you over fill, Enterprise wins!!!< /Text>

I absolutely love Enterprise rentals, every time I walk in there I feel like I’m with family. They’re courteous and polite not to mention efficient. I would recommend them over any leading rental company. Thanks enterprise<//Review>

<review>I've always gotten great service from Enterprise rent-a-car and this location was no different! Peta gave outstanding customer service! She went over the vehicles options and remained very professional.  I forgot to bring my major credit card with me and only had my debit card so I wasn't able to get the vehicle I requested. I understood that because it is their policy on the more luxurious type vehicles.  Very happy with Peta's customer service she provided. I would recommend this location for sure. Would have given 5 stars but the Jeep I had hurt my back.
Wish I could have thanked Peta in person but she was off the day I returned the vehicle.
Thanks Enterprise!< /review>< Pics>

Very bad service we had gotten a reservation days before and we show up to pick it up and we're greeted by a very upset employee. He was being very rude saying that its not here and that they weren't open didn't even try to help us to see if our reservation was somewhere else he was just very rude.< /Review>

If I could give 0 stars I would. Their customer service was horrible, they were completely unorganized and I had to call them a million times on a million different numbers and they all told me different things and tried to charge me for an extra day and wouldn’t let me return the car unless I drove all the way to palm desert 30 minutes away. I will never use enterprise again and I suggest you never do either. Their corporate office was just as horrible and rude, the first customer service rep was insulting and disrespectful. Don’t interact with them, don’t call them, don’t spend your money here.</Review>

<Review>If I could give 0 stars, I would. Something as simple as charging a credit card gets routinely messed by this location. I have NEVER had to deal with so many incompetent people in my life. This isn't rocket science! I gave them my personal visa card to use and they, instead, used the card on file.  I didn't authorize their using my business card, nor did I expect such a difficult experience in getting it corrected. Not only was it not my fault, but they continue to blame me for not ensuring that they do their job correctly.  Needless to say, I'm furious with the people at the Indio, CA location.  I'm still dealing with this issue.  The rental happened on July 12, 2019. What happened to customer service?< /Review>< pics>

<review>The entire Enterprise Rent-A-Car experience deserves zero stars and was hands-down, THE WORST experience I've had with Enterprise Rent-A-Car.  The 1-star that I've given it is only due to the website not allowing me to continue with my review unless I select 1-star.< /review>< pics>

I rent a lot of cars, from various companies.  I have rented from Enterprise many times in the past, but this was the first rental at this location in Indio.

What a great experience.  I was greeted so warmly from the time Oscar, the driver picked me up.  In the office, Edwin, who is a Management Trainee, and and Rigo, the Assistant Branch Manager, could not have been more pleasant and accommodating.  I look forward to renting from them again.   Top notch staff, and quick and easy transaction.</text>

<review>Their office and lot isn't in the cleanest part of town, but they give great service. I showed up for the reservation made by my insurance company, and they took care of me quickly and efficiently. They put me in a nice clean car that ran well and had enough gas to get me to where I needed to go before having to refuel. The check in and pick up process could not have been smoother. Thanks, Enterprise.</review></record>

They really went above and beyond my expectations! I had a problem at a different location who did not have my car I had reserved. I was waiting for a district manager to call me (still waiting....) when I mentioned the issue they dropped my one way charge and gave me a discount on the rental.  My issue was not with this location and they lost money on my rental to make up for another location's mistake.  They saved me as a customer and I appreciate the staff as well!</Text>

Reserved a car in the morning, called an hour later to tell me they ran out of cars but I could take a pickup truck. I get there and they see I'm under 25. No pickup. But I can rent an ENORMOUS cargo van.
Extreme inconvenience, but they were also incredibly accommodating. He gave me a bunch of discounts! I was happy at the end of the day< /review>

I had the wait about 30 minutes to get a car back from the wash, but ended up with a free upgrade so it was well worth it!

The experience that I had with my recent rental was very very good. The people at the Indio, CA location, are really on the ball, with all of their customer, while I was there waiting for my rental to be washed I had the opportunity to listen to other employees waiting on customers like myself. When I was there to pick up my rental last week, I was helped by your employee Mr. Octavio (did not get his last name) who was on the ball with relating all of Enterprise's rental conditions, especially since I only use one of my bank debit card for the rental. The return was very much the same. I checked in with your store manager, and was taking home by Scott,and, again experienced the same good attitude about working with Enterprise. They are all very customer oriented, smart people.<//text>

They were really good with my Grandmother who couldn't get out of our car. We were renting a small pick-up truck, but they gave us a free upgrade. It was a REALLY nice vehicle. Rode nicely and everything. Ithe even got some great gas mileage. I was impressed. Thanks You all for giving us what we needed! And for changing the reservation. As since the Enterprise website screwed it up. You were great with us. All of you.<//Review>

<text>I have always used Enterprise when I needed a vehicle.  I have not
had to use them in a while.  I have been member of Enterprise Plus
since 2009.  On the weekend of May 12th I rented a car.  They took
my Debit card and put $250.00 deposit on it.  When I returned the
car they Kept. $119.00 and credited my card $130.00.

On the following weekend May 20, 2017, I went to pick up the car I reserved: no cars available. I had eight waiting ahead of me.  The Manager
said she could do the paper and when a car showed up I would
be ready to go.  Show I gave her my debit card and the next thing
I know in front of everyone, she told me that she needed another
card that one would not pass.  Told her there should be plenty
to cover the Deposit.  She politely said I am sorry but we have to charge
the deposit plus the rental fee, that was company policy.

I asked what was different from the weekend before when I got a car.
I told her that you only took the deposit.  I showed her my receipt
and she well someone made a mistake.  I told her when I called in
and reserved I  that only the deposit would be taken.  So I guess
they change their policy on a day to day bases.

I might add that on both weekends when I showed up to pick up
the car there was no cars available.  I waited the first weekend and
it only took about 20 minutes.  The weekend of the 20th of May
with eight people waiting ahead of me .  I walked out.....</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1495655795635, 'text': 'Thank you for bringing this to our attention Mr. Sloan.

Finally a headache free experience. As long as you have a major CC with enough money to cover the rental and $200 deposit and a valid drivers license there are no issues.</text>

Do Not Bother with this Unprofessional Branch...made a reservation over the phone for 9am when I called to get picked up I was on hold with their pickup counter for over 20 mins and then told no vehicle would be ready till 2:30pm even though my reservation was for 9am. When I asked to speak with the manager I was on hold for more than 10 mins before I just hung up and rented a car from another local establishment. Will not be renting from any enterprise again tbh because this experience was such a frustrating waste of time first thing in the morning when it should have been simply resolved and a manager should have been present to assist. Nobody has time for this kind of lack of professionalism and care in 2018!</text>

<text>The experience was good. The car we rented had a check engine light when we were at Joshua Tree Nation Park. We called the Indio office and office manager (Carlos) worked with us to minimize and disrupt to our trip.

When we got back to Indio Carlos upgraded the car at the same rate for any inconvenience.

<Review>When you most need a vehicle the last thing you should expect is rudeness from the ones who are there to help. Well my experience with the enterprise in Indio is less than desirable! the manager "TODD" was so rude and unhelpful, Todd the manager was wearing a cream jacket with dirty brown stains on it that looked like poop, his attitude was horrible and I seriously felt discriminated against. his way of helping was to send me off to fix it myself. I understand customer service because I have over 15 years of experience, However "TODD" obviously hates his job and should not even be allowed to work with the public because he is lazy, dirty, rude, unhelpful and negative. I will never go back to this location just because of this "manager" it really says a lot about the company when they have people like him in charge. however it creates business for the competition. I hope this company seriously takes a really good look at this guy because something is wrong with him other than being dull/bland and unenthusiastic about life in general!!!< /Review><user>110519727897650519712</user></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Due to car accident and plan to take my car
to a body shop. I call my insurance company
and requested to provide me a car rental,
I was told by my insurance company that I can get
any car I want and they will cover $30/day.
I made my car rental reservation thru Enterprisse website and got a better rate.
Upon arriving at the car rental in Indio to
pick  up the car. I was surprised that the rate I got from their website is not accepted. I was told
that they have a contracted rate with my Insurance company. I was not aware of the contracted rate. Few months ago I was in the same situation and no problem. During the process of providing me the rental the asst. manager is very argumentative and treaten  me
to cancel my reservation and direct me to their
Competitor next door/Herz . If I’m the
Owner of this business I will reprehend  these employees,They need  to get a proper training
In customer service and building customer loyalty and not giving away business to competitor.I told the branch manager that I will
share my experience to their corporate office
and he said in a rude way, I can provide you
With their number. I rented the car due to necessity that day ,but only keep the car for
two days. The company loss my two weeks or more
rental revenue due to a few dollar difference
and a loyal customer.. Avoid the Indio location.
The branch manager Todd Anderson and
the assistant Carlos De La Torre are not friendly. Not only that ,they give me a car that is
dirty.<//Review><rate>1</rate><resp>{'time': 1511235494161, 'text': 'Nestor Padilla, I would be happy to look into this for you. Please email care@enterprise.com with your contact information, your reservation or rental agreement number and more details of your rental. Thanks. John'}< /resp>< Time>

I have rented several cars from Enterprise in the past few months to able me to take why wife in for cancer treatments rather than the Dial A Ride. My first terrible experience was with your Palm Desert, Ca. location. My wife had a Oncologist appointment at 1:30 PM PST. I had arraigned for a 12.00 PM pickup with her appointment only 6 miles away. I called the location, your "OASIS" store in Palm Desert, only 3 miles from me
at 9:00 AM to make the pickup arraignment a they assured me that they would pick us up on time. Well, 12: 00 PM came and gone and NO ENTERPRISE. 12:15 went and gone, NO ENTERPRISE, so I immediately called the PALM DESERT "OASIS" center and the person that answer responded" WE HAVE NO PICKUP SCHEDULED FOR YOU MR. THATCH" After explaining to him I talkedited by  to female employee about arranging by pickup he put me on hold, he came back after a long HOLD, and explained he found a note on the females desk and that she hadn't put it in the system. To make the long story short, we were an hour and a half late leaving ENTERPRISE,  to late arriving for my wife's MRI SCAN. She lost her appointment, they put her in the for the next day. I've  been in the service business all my life. I owned and operated the forth largest Limousine Company in California and not once was I late to incompetent employees or they were fired and mu client was not chrged for a $845.00 Limousine bill. Then a month later almost the same thing repeated itself at your INDIO ENTERPRISE location, they were only 45 minutes late. There phones were down the morning of the pickup, ALL I RECEIVED WAS A " GOOD BYE" when I tried to fool up on my pickup. I gave them ALL the gate information and when the driver arrived to enter the gate he had not been given the pickup information I gave when I scheduled my pickup , in turn he was late and we left the INDIO LOCATION at 1:15 PM for a 1:30 PM Oncologist appointment and MRI. My 74 year old wife is going blind and I need to attend another appointment this week, LET'S  PRAY WE GET THERE ON TIME. A faithful ENTERPRISE MEMBER # 9M9Z99J<//review>

Safe and comfortable. They check your temperature before going in for treatment and  they ask you to sanitize your hands. Amazing staff. I’m a person that is scared of the dentist treatments, but Doctor and assistant made me feel no pain at all. I’m so happy that I found this dentist.<//text>

<Text>I have been a patient here for a while now. The two things that I really appreciate are that they offer emergency dental care and have reasonable pricing. I have been to many other dental offices, and have always paid an arm and a leg for unnecessary treatments. I find this office very honest and trustworthy. I have not been disappointed yet. I have been able to use my insurance for a few big procedures every year. My other dentist made me chose between a root canal or a crown because each procedure would take up all of my insurance allowance for that year. Here, I been able to spread out the work, while getting my money’s worth. You will not be disappointed. The only negative thing I can say is that there are way too patients and they often have lines out the door because of how in demand this place is. I highly recommend making an appointment to ensure you are seen right away, even though they offer walk-in.< /Text>< rating>

<text>I went in for a toothache and i ended up getting a tooth pulled. The doctor was fast and painless. The staff was quick and efficient. Usually, I have to wait 2 hours to see my dentist but the wait felt like nothing. I have never seen a buisiness so prepared for the pandemic as just smile. From the reception area to the treatment rooms, i felt safe and clean. Even though it is summertime and hot outside, the office was suprisingly cool and had a relaxing mood.

The guy who works here. He is short and Latino with a rude attitude is the worst. I am on the phone and he tells me the office is closed. Is this true? Because this is an essential work and I read online in their website that they are open. Can someone verified? My crown is coming off and it’s an emergency and i keep calling but no luck anymore. It is like he keeps sending me to voicemail.< /text>

<review>Do not come to this location. I have no idea how people rate this office well. Maybe the dentist is that great that it overshadows the rest of the office. I wouldn't know since I made one visit and wont' be back. Anyway, the staff is absolutely terrible. I went in for my initial visit in March. When I arrived I was told I needed to have my authorization changed to the Vermont location since I was assigned to Union. I was told this in the waiting room and not on the phone when making my appointment. I got on the phone with my insurance company and switched easily. I was called in, had an exam and x-rays. Then was told I needed to reschedule for cleaning because my insurance wasn't initiated there which was untrue. Why would they have done my x-ray and exam? Then COVID happened and my cleaning appt was cancelled. I wasn't able to reschedule for a while since they didn't have the instruments they needed (I guess that helped with sterilization during COVID?) who knows. I would call again to schedule and was told they system was down. So that's when I decided to switch my provider. I attempted to get my x-rays and chart notes and I was told I would be sent a medical release form.. did not happen. I would call again and same thing. I was told it would take a few hours and it would be quicker to come in. I called again today and was told that I can't have my results since I didn't pay for the services. I did not receive a bill from the office or insurance so I called my insurance company who told me they did not receive a claim. I told this to a gentleman on the phone who said, it takes time for the claim to go through. It is August 3rd. It was not claimed for 5 months! Nonetheless, just send me the release form so I can stop living this nightmare. I had my assistant continue to work on getting my x-rays as I am a physician assistant and don't have time to play phone tag with another office. The woman on the phone told my assistant, mockingly, "she has to get her mom to call". How dare you say that to a patient, let alone a medical provider. I called the Union location, was sent a medical release form within minutes, then received my x-ray - total of 10 minutes elapsed. Why couldn't it have been that simple in the beginning, instead of causing me stress for months on end. If you need anything done, go to the Union office. Not Vermont. Or don't go to this establishment at all.<//review><Resp>{'time': 1596615174805, 'text': 'We are sorry about your bad experience and any confusion or miscommunication. We understand you wanted your records, but you initially refused to complete release paperwork that is required, as we explained to you and your assistant. Your assistant identified herself as your daughter and we explained that we needed to speak to her mother, you.  She had a lot of time on her hands because her phone calls were at the point where the office staff felt harassed. You were notified before you came to the office that you needed to change the location. Your initial appointment was only scheduled for a consultation, not for treatment. That is why we needed to reschedule your cleaning for your next appointment. After the onset of Covid, The American dental Association (ADA) issued stoppage of the use of ultrasonic scalers, which is used to do the cleanings. This delay was out of our hands. The records you were requesting were only for the exam and the x-rays, none of which you were asked to pay for. We didn’t even charge for the records, we have only asked for you to fill out a written record release form, which is office protocol. According to the CDA, records  can take up to 30 days after the written request and there is usually a fee. We were willing to release them as soon as you filled out the paperwork, which we did, again all at no charge. Our offices are not independent of each other, so both of our locations have the same protocol. If you had called the office yourself, it would have avoided all this confusion and miscommunication with your assistant. At one point your assistant called our office over 20 times in one day, that is going beyond harassment, which we have record of. Also, we are not allowed to discuss or release information to anyone, but the patient.  As I’m sure you have already figured out, dental x-rays over 3 months are not usually valid at most dental offices.  Best of luck.'}</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c764f5915a6d:0x70d3e22181415ef</gmap_id>< user_id>

<Review>The doctors are very gentle and take their time. I never feeel rushed or feel treated like just a never. The doctors take the time to explain treatment very thoroughly which makes me comfortable and at ease. I was able to get my crown in record time. Their equipment is also the top of the line technology. The machine they used for my x-ray (CT  Scan) allowed me to clearly see the condition of all of my teeth. Would highly recommend this place.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c2c764f5915a6d:0x70d3e22181415ef<//gmap_id></record>

If you are looking for excellent work done by kind and helpful dentist then this is the place to go. I have always hated Dentist but the staff here made me feel so comfortable, i will never go to another place. They know what they are doing and are completely honest when it comes to the work that needs to be done in order to ensure you have the best outcome. Also love the fact that have such advance equipment then the average dental offices.<//text>

I had once of the best experiences with just smile dental. I have a cavity that I've been avoiding to get done in the last few years. This weekend I couldn't take it anymore and when I went to just smile they really did a great job with the cleaning I wanted to see what they could do for my cavity. The Dr informed me they would be able to take care of it the same day and wow what a relief of pain. The Dr there is so gentle and I hardly felt them fixing my teeth. Really happy I found such a great dental office in Los Angeles with helpful staff and compassionate Dr's.< /review>

<Text>I AM BLOWN AWAY!!! This was the absolute BEST dental office I have ever been to. I had a broken tooth that was causing extreme pain last night . I couldn't sleep I ended up requesting an appt that morning around 1am ... I got a response withing two hours saying to come In at 11am. Yes, I got a email response at 3am .. almost immediately following my appt request. Boy, did that set me at ease to know I was all set to go in that morning. I went in today at 11... And wow!!!! The ENTIRE STAFF was absolutely AMAZING!!!!  They were able to address my issue immediately  , I got my broken wisdom tooth extracted within the hour ! The dentist was so nice , friendly  and explained everything that was happening , I felt no pain at all!!!  I am so shocked by their level of professionalism, and thier compassion for the extreme discomfort I was in. I HIGHLY recommended this dentist office for all of your dental needs!!! They were absolutely incredible . This will be my go to office from now on!!! THANKS TO EVERYONE AT JUST SMILE DENTISTRY!!! YOU GUYS ARE ROCKSTARS!!!!!</Text>< pictures>

I went to this Dental Center a few days ago, to get a stetic refill because of a broken front teeth, they did a HORRIBLE job, they messed up the teeth next to the one that needed fixing, and within half a day the material they used came off, i went again to the clinic and they tried to fix it however, after  "fixing" my teeth within half a day (AGAIN) the material came off!... Naturally i complained about this the second time since i paid a lot to get the work done properly.

The staff at this clinic looked at me with rage, and the manager named Victor yelled at me in front of their staff members saying "WHAT DO YOU WANT?"

I am still waiting for my refund, which they have kept me waiting for about 2 weeks now.. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CLINIC!.</Text>

Was very strange... they tried to say they would not clean my teeth without an extra $240 charge cuz my HMO I guess doesn't pay that much

but it was just weird how they tried to upcharge and I saw the dentist and then they refuse to clean my teeth with the regular HMO insurance so I guess I'd probably try a different office<//Review>

They capped a chipped tooth for me and it fell off within a week. I went back for a replacement and they gave me a hard time but eventually did the procedure again for free. Terrible place.< /Review>

I wish I could give zero stars.  I have been giving convalescent plasma and it has been very difficult to schedule.  Every time I have gone they take me at least 45 minutes after my appointment time.  The people who work there are very rude and uncaring. It's kind of bizarre.  Two of the five times I've had an appointment to give plasma, they have canceled on me without giving me a reason.<//text>

<Review>This is for the parking it is not $5.00 with validation it is $5.00 off so if you stay overnight it is more. So far I like the hospital fine just thought I would save the unwelcome surprise while checking out Ok Been here for a week. This is a very nice hospital CLEAN. I highly reccommend .<//Review><Rate>4<//Rate>< Name>

They have no respect for your time. I had 1:00pm appointment after 45 minutes of waiting I was told that I have wait another 30 minutes. It isnot that they are busy, it just slow. I see nurses and staff talking and ignoring
the people. I never again will go there.<//Text>

<text>Made an appointment, got there about 8 min late, they made me wait outside while other people go in, and once it was about quarter of an hour later, they tell me I was too late for my appointment and that I had to reschedule because they wouldn’t see me now.

I really like the staff here! They are very kind and made me feel at ease on my first platelet donation! Had an infiltration (wouldn't doubt it was my own fault, I can be fidgety), but they took care of it quick and I had almost no bruising! I'll be back :)<//review>

<rating>2< /rating><review>I usually have a good experience however I faced unpleasant incidents today:

I donate blood regularly and prior to each donation, I inform the nurse about my veins being too small and that they require a bit of extra attention for a good flow and no bruise later on my skin. The information is usually appreciated and no issues arise.

However, to my surprise today, the nurse who was a big lady and acted inconsiderate with the info I provided for her, enlightened me firmly with some additional information:
“It is a needle, it will go inside your skin, and it will hurt..! So if you think it will not hurt, you better understand, it will!.....”

I thought she was rude, angry and a bit too violent for the occasion. So I politely requested for her supervisor. (Later I saw the same big nurse laughing loud with other volunteers trying to look all sweet, friendly and fun - no one else was laughing as loud and as long!)

The supervisor came to me and she was obviously told by the big lady that I was a volunteer scared of needles. The supervisor tried to nicely explain there WILL be some pain! She also checked my arms and told me she was surprised why I have had issues before. As if I had imagined those issues about small veins - perhaps because I was scared of needles?!

Fast forward, I left half an later without being able to donate, after two nurses tried and tried to get blood flow from that small vein I had explained to them but they had not taken it seriously.
They put the needle in and out and moved it in my skin several times looking for the vein asking me if it was painful?! The big nurse had come to help and she could not get the blood flow either. Eventually they gave up.

A friendly note to the Red Cross -

All the consultation prior to the donation is to minimize complications. Please take comments from the volunteers seriously. If I inform you my veins are small, it does not mean I am scared of needles. It simply means “my veins are small” and I know it from experience. Is it impossible to draw blood from my veins? No! it just required your well experienced nurse, instead of two nurses trying to dig into my skin and explore where the vein was! That’s all I was asking for. Please don’t give the lecture that all your nurses are equally good. See what happened today? Your staff are humans not robots, and like any other profession, you have good ones and better ones in your team. Assign the right nurse for particular occasions.< /review>< pictures>

< review>
I usually had a good experience with them but once I had a lady who were in a hurry which she checked her watch a few times within 10minutes. At the end, my vein was busted because she was moving it around to try to get a better flow. She had to stop the donation process because a bruise is quickly developing. Other times, staffs were very friendly.</review>

I wish I could give them a higher score. Nothing like 2 years in a row to be disappointed. We signed the waivers and gathered our supplies. Moving out to the end of the orchard there were no apples!

If there were apples, they all had holes in them. It was sad and dreams were broken .

We did enjoy the tasty treats and cider.

The employees were super friendly. Shout out to the dude heating up pie!

If you drive up and see barren trees on the way in,just go straight in the store.<//Text>

Apples! Apples! Apples! That's Denver Dan's specialty. Pick apples in the orchard. They have signs with the varieties you can choose from. Feel free to taste as you go. Such fun for an afternoon adventure. Pie, jams, and other things can be night from the store too.</Review>

Such a great variety of apples, many that you would never find in a store! I love picking here and come every year to get a variety of apples for my students to taste. Also a great variety of pastries, jams, etc. and a great place for kids. Definitely recommend!< /Text>

Denver Dan's is awesome! It has lots of apple trees for picking, nice selection of apple products for purchase, smoke parking, and friendly cashiers. This is one of my must stops when visiting Apple Hill🍎< /Review>

Super fun experience. Very few apples still on the trees, but that's on me for going too late in the season. Staff was super friendly, and the atmosphere was fun. Thank you, Denver Dan's!</review>

Apple Hill was packed so we did decide to visit a few of the smaller farms to avoid the craziness.

This one was on the small side but everyone was friendly got a demo on the old apple coring machine (have video not photo sorry), the little corer, bought some delicious cider, and checked out the tasting station for all their syrups, butters and I had to get the apple cider one because it was so good.  So when this area gets overrun perfect choice to visit< /review>

I love this stop along apple hill. They have some of my favorite goodies to buy here. I've made two trips for their sugar free apple butter. It is soo good. And of course their pies, cobbers and strudel are amazing. I'm sharing one of their peach cobblers at Thanksgiving.🤗👍😊🐥</Text>

It was a great choice! Margie was such a great host and instructor. She is a retired teacher and interacted well with kids and adults. Everyone loved making apple pies, and the treats were delicious. The orchard is a smaller, family place compared to others in Apple Hill. I would recommend it to anyone. We had a great time!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Excellent! We had a great time and our daughter loved the fact she was able to ride the ponies. The petting / feeding area was fun, the animals all seem well behaved. The shop and seating area was also nice. I will recommend this place to everyone.<//Review>

Nice little place on Apple Hill with a good selection of apple butters, pies, etc. Staff is friendly and helpful. There's a petting zoo for kids - the alpacas are a big hit. "Pasty" type sandwiches are the only food option besides apple products. If you're touring Apple Hill and are anywhere near this place, it's worth a look.< /review>

When we got there, the boy at the cashier said we were welcomed to sample any of the apples from the tree. So silly me for assuming that this place was organic. So we did that, and then we walked past a shed with a huge sign 'pesticides, keep out.' When we went to pay, I asked the girl if the apples are organic and she literally said 'I don't know what that means.' Seriously!? How do you not know what that means when you work in the food industry? Then she says 'They are sprayed.' So she knew what that meant but didn't want to say it.  And thank you NOT for telling me that I can sample the apples from the tree which have not been washed so we can ingest the unknown pesticides. I'm not getting on this place because it's not organic but I'm getting on it because they were telling us to basically eat the unwashed apples and then acting like they didn't know what organic meant.</Text>

<resp>None< /resp><pics>None<//pics><review>We have been coming here for years! Its one of my favorite stops in Apple Hill, not only do they have a great selection of apples available in the U-pick orchard; but have a selection of apple products including vinigars, sauces and syrups that more then once has caused me to take the hour long round trip to refill. In the last few years they have started to make a big move with other fruit sauces too! I highly recommend you get a jar of apple butter; and always get a giant bottle or three of the cider sauce - its amazing on vanilla ice cream.< /review>< gmap_id>

I learned how to frontside 180 down a 2 stair all due to their company. Their positivity and commitment to tricks are amazing and thank you Ricky "Ice" Glaser to TRON skatepark I wish I went that day<//Text>

I cannot stress enough how much I love this company, their message and goal, and their helpful and entertaining content. I have extensively watched Braille Skateboarding on youtube for months, learning tricks and laughing at the all of the funny and entertaining videos that they post. I finally broke down and bought the Skateboarding made simple Volume 1. I came across a problem in which it I couldn't download the video and I was very worried because I had already paid. All I had to do was leave an email and in less the 12 hours they had already contacted me back with a new link and all of the help that they could give me. By the time that they woke up I already had the link. It then worked perfectly and I am so exited. Thank you so much for the amazing customer service, content, beautiful tutorials, and simply adding joy to my day when I watch your content and how easy you make it to learn these tricks. The goal that Braille has is beautiful and they are doing a magnificent job to achieve. I would not be able to even ride a skateboard if it weren't for them. Thank you so much again and I can't explain how grateful I am that they exist. Have a nice day</Text>

<Review>these guys are great! I ordered 2 skateboard decks and a windbreaker, I only recieved the wind breaker at first and was worried something happened to the boards. I reached out to them on facebook and got a hold of Codi they explained EXACTLY what the delay was ( board still needed to be signed) they assured me I will be notified when they ship and a team member even told me they are personally keeping an eye on the shipment for me. Not sure you can ask for much more in terms of customer service, thanks again Codi!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I explained what happened  to customer service and they replied in 5-10 minutes with a detailed response on what to do and new links in case I needed them.

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>The Braille House is everything I imagined it would be. From seeing it from YouTube to in person is just inspiring to know all the legends who walked through this skate park.

The Braille House is not open to the public, but you can book a private skate lesson there. Nelson, the instructor, is very nice. If you're a more advanced skater, he'll session with you and help you accomplish a trick you've been working on!

The plus side to this is that if the Braille Guys are around, you can say hi and meet them as they're super friendly.

Thanks Braille for everything you do for the skate community! #skateordie<//Text><user>110402679738693145166</user><GmapID>0x808f902f17e41dd9:0xd81c2ec8b6b57fbc< /GmapID>< response>

<username>Raquel Marie<//username><date>1601667013077</date><Rating>1</Rating><text>I ordered a skateboard on September 20th and waited about a week and no email of it shipping out.  I emailed the company and they informed a day later that they had just run out of the board I wanted and suggested a different option, and that they would get it shipped out that day, so then I told them I was ok with that.  It’s been 3 days and I have not gotten a confirmation or tracking number for the shipment... The customer service was good about the situation but it seems that they fail to let you know what’s going on with your order. Hopefully I get some sort of confirmation that my package has shipped or it’s coming soon.  I would expect something like that for $26 shipping.
Update: turns out they never even sent me the other option that they said “shipped out today”. Emailed them again and they decided to tell me that they were out of the second option.  They said they will send me a different board today.... I don’t believe it. I have no clue why this como any made things so complicated with me.  I read all of these great reviews and none of them match to my situation:(<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Although I paid $131 (includes shipping $20 something dollars) for the board on the picture including the Swirly wheels! I did contact them and they said they were out of the brand of wheels and that I could buy them separately but the only problem is, is that where they got them are no longer being sold. It’s unfortunate. I hope they get this photo updated as soon as possible. It’s not a big deal but over all the board itself and learning on it personally is 5/5<//review>< Rate>

<rating>5< /rating><review>These folks are very customer attentive .  I accidentally entered the wrong address for the recipient of a skateboard I had orderd.  When I realized my mistake, I emailed Braille Skateboarding and they send me a response that there were able to correct the shipped to address in time.  Due to Covid -19 mailing snafus the package came back to Braille, and I received an email letting me know that the package was returned and they politely asked if the shipping address was correct.  Long story short, it was mailed again and arrived to the recipient my nephew.  His sister who has a Walmart special skateboard, was green with envy, seeing how well made his board was.  So she is getting one for her birthday as well.  When I ordered the second board, I used a promotion code that was not reflected in the invoice.  I emailed asking if they would honor the code.  Again I received a timely email, letting me know of the error and it was corrected.  I wish more companies were like this one with a good product and great customer service.</review>< pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I came here for a skate summer camp in early August Andi was a little nervous being 32 and having never skated. But when I stared all of my fears went away. The instructor, Mario, was amazing and really patient, supportive and motivating. I was the second oldest in the group and I managed to learn how kick turn, go down and up ramps, and drop in the ramps. I got to meet a few of the Braille Army and they were super chill. I can't wait to go back and do another camp! Thank you Braille team!</Text>< pics>

<Text>Some great rock walls and a bouldering area. They also have a small gym. This place is awesome. I bring my 7yo son all the time and all the people are kind and welcoming. It's a good place to learn. They don't have any automatic belay so you'll need a buddy if you wanna climb the walls.<//Text>< Pics>

Awesome facility with constantly rotating routes for new challenges. Staff are all super friendly and helpful and everything is kept cleaned and organized. I recently joined a few weeks ago and everyone there has made jumping into climbing an easy and fun experience. They also have CrossFit classes at a discount for members so I might be trying that in the future. They do have drop-in rates and month passes, but do yourself a favor and just get a membership and it pays for itself within a few visits!<//Text>

< review>
I haven't been to many climbing gyms in the past, so i thought that the reason i was so impressed with this place was due to my inexperience, but when i caught the bug, got back home to Florida, and tried to find something similar i soon realized how special Diablo rock gym really is.

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, and the facility is incredible. Best of all, the atmosphere and people there was infectious. Everyone is extremely encouraging, and wants to see you succeed, and will help you get there.

The fully equipped weight training facility inside was a great bonus!

What an awesome place to get fit and have a lot of fun!</review>

This place is awesome. I went for a yoga class with a friend and everyone was very friendly. Kate, the yoga instructor, is exceptional. She creates a very personalized feeling in thew class. It was my first yoga class ever, and I didn't feel awkward at all!</text>

<Text>Only been here a few times with friends who are members... Very dope place. On top of the rock walls and bouldering area there's weight equipment, locker rooms equipped with showers steam room & sauna, yoga classes offered, I think cross fit too? Not sure what the deal is with these guys and Diablo cross fit but I'd assume if you're a member of either you probably get some sort of deal if you want to use the other? Clean place, cool people, friendly employees. It is a little steep for a student like myself I think a monthly membership runs something around $67 but considering all the stuff you can use that's not bad at all.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

The two guys who answered the phone on 8/25/18 at 11:30 a.m.  were unable or unwilling to answer my questions. However, they were both quick to tell me that most people go online for information. So here I am online writing this review. The information given to me by your employees contradicted what your webpage says as far as booking Kids belay. I assume then that they either didn't really check the availability or that your webpage is wrong and thus my phone call was necessary, Or your employees are lazy (read way to cool to give out accurate information) and losing you a trivial amount of money. I understand that $40 is meaningless to your business, I also understand that losing one customer isn't really that important, but what should mean a lot is excluding two young girls from participating in the sport that your business is so passionate about. Thanks guys.<//text>

I have a bunch of friends that go rock climbing in the city but since I work out of walnit Creek I didn't have the time to go. A co-worker said that there was a gym in walnut Creek so I decided to try it out.

At first I thought it was small because I only bouldered, but as I started to get into top roping and getting into harder routes it was a very friendly and warm place.

At this location they hold a bunch of free events for members and everyone that I talk to that goes here loves it.</text>

So Disappointing.

This review is based on the overall experience. Our 11 year old son, after a previous visit to this gym, requested his birthday party be kept at this place. We called the Gym in advance to reserve, and were told that the reservation can only be done online and assured us it is easy, safe and secured (questionable). Setup the reservation online paying the deposit, and when we called the day before the event to ask questions regarding bringing in the pizza and cake, we were told "There is NO reservation!", and that there is nothing that can be done at this time. We had invited 16 kids to come from Lafayette and had no place to go. After calling back, the reservation was found, however made at Fresno Gym. We never inquired about any other locations and made the reservation on their site without getting any options to choose a different location. Now that the reservation was found, we are told that we still cannot come because they do not have staff. We offered to do ropes and we were told to come late that day for training. Once the staff part was resolved, we were told that they do not have a room to do the party in. After insisting for awhile, they offered their yoga classroom. Once we saw it we understood their hesitation... The room was smelling terrible and felt dirty and the chairs they provided looked like they were retrieved from a garbage bin as well as not enough of them. Dirty, ugly looking, or even smaller size. We had to ask for someone to do something about that smell so that we can bring the kids and have them fed. The check in process was slow, unpleasant and disorganized. We were embarrassed in front of the parents dropping of their children but for the staff it seemed normal. Most kids in our party within the hour and a half provided, they did the claim once or twice due to the overcrowding and long wait times. We were not at ease with the instructors that told 8-10 year old kids to claim the big boulders without the ropes. Three instructors were supposed to be assigned to our group, however we only saw one active and assumed that two other ones were talking to each other by the smaller boulders intended for the younger kids. Most staff was unpleasant to talk to or was talking to the kids in a "somewhat rude" and inpatient manner without explaining what was that they did wrong.

The amount of stress that this particular part of our son's birthday celebration put on us was not worth the little fun the Gym provides. We believe it may be a great place to work out or claim but by no means they are ready or willing to host and welcome a group of kids coming all at once.< /Text>

<Review>My favorite of all the Touchstone gyms in the Bay Area.  Never too crowded, lots of climbs, and a great outdoor workout area for classes or general lifting.  Indoor bike parking as well.</Review></record></dataset><record>
< Review>
Great climbing gym

Cons:
Somewhat smaller facility for Touchstone climbing
Bouldering is a bit limited

Pros:
Full service: towels, showers, weights, and loads of climbing</Review>

The gym environment is great, and it is usually fairly open. There are only a handful of routes under 5.10 in rating, so it isn't great for less skilled climbers, though I have been enjoying pushing myself onto the harder routes.<//text>

<Text>It is nice to see a place that has been in this town for many years and still surviving. Not the best location or area but no where really is anymore. We will definitely go back and maybe eat lunch before ice cream.</Text><GmapID>0x808557714b46b46d:0x118a07f1d64b2202<//GmapID><Time>1622347179249< /Time><username>Nicholas Scarbrough</username><pics>None</pics>< Rating>

Always great service, just super busy. But thats because their food is yummy and blizzards are on point. Chicken strip baskets are the best.<//Review>

Food and blizzards are great.  Old building, probably built in the 60s or earlier.  No inside seating or restroom.  A simple place to order your food or ice cream.< /Review>

Hi all: I got a response from DQ owner.  Sir, Madame - let this be known, it wasn't the food or the service.  In all sincerity it was it was the social engagement around your premises.  I personally appreciate you reaching out to me.
Sincerely yours.

Besides being slow their rude totally not people friendly or customer service friendly by any means. Considering the quality of the food, not so good definitely not worth the expense. It really just left a bad taste in my mouth regarding atmosphere employees and pricing... wouldn't recommend wouldn't go back to this specific location  anyway< /Text>< pics>

Ordered the $5 meal, which came with a cheese burger, fries, upgraded drink to a slushy AND a small sundae. Also, my son wantedl the 2 chicken strips kids meal, which included the chicken, a small drink (he opted for milk) fries or a banana. Total came to a decent price of $12.33. Not bad at all.  Folks running the place were polite and friendly.<//review>

It's pretty good fast food that's made to order at reasonable prices, you really can't ask for much more than that. On top of that, the service is great with very friendly and attentive staff. I can see myself becoming a regular.<//Review>

There should be more of these places. This part of town is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.  Blizzards are late night snack perfection. Haven't had the food there in years, so no promises. But man, those treats there. Mmmmmm<//text>

No line when I got there, (window only service) I took advantage of their $6.00 special which was an awesome deal (chicken sandwich, fries,soda and a sundae of your choice topping!!). There was a sudden rush of people and the line became long. What I observed was no one became impatient and left. This spoke volumes regarding the food and/or it's prices. Majority of the line ordered ice cream of some sort (Blizzards).
Considering it was a 2 man operation and a 10 minute wait (5mins in line and 5mins order ready).  I think they did an awesome job getting the orders out. My food was hot and delicious for such a great deal.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I still love a good old fashioned ice cream and my favorite place to fulfill that is at Dairy Queen!  I love the Peanut Buster Parfaits as they remind me of my high school days.
The service was very friendly & timely.  I will go back again!</review>

<Review>Good service but not the best looking Dairy Queen and there's no drive thru so you have to park, get out, order, wait, get items and leave. Would be nice if there was a drive thru or if the seating area was cleaner and better looking. Also wish there was exterior lighting in the seating area because it was just too dark after the sun set.< /Review>< pics>

Dairy Queen isn't what I normally think of when I want a burger meal, but some friends and I happened to be nearby and hungry, and decided to give it a try. We were very pleasantly surprised to find a $5 lunch deal for a burger, fries, small soda, and a small Blizzard blended ice cream dessert. You can't beat that!

The burger and fries were better than I expected, being better than average for a fast-food burger, and we got our food quickly. Of course, the big winner was the Blizzard (I went with Heath Bar), which are always delicious.

This is a 50's or 60's era Drive In, so the decor consists of a couple of picnic tables along the side of the building, which are frequently sticky from ice cream. They were pretty clean this day, but you never know what you're going to get.

Bottom line, though: if you want a pretty good fast-food burger lunch at a good price, with a bonus Blizzard, it's worth the bit of extra time and effort to visit DQ.<//text>

Mainly, there's no indoor seating, just patio seating so a rainy day trip is not advised. Secondly, they close at 8 instead of 9 so their hours online are mislabeled, and maybe it was because I got there almost at 8 not knowing that they were closing but my blizzard was only half stirred (but still delicious) with a good amount of toppings so I still left happy< /text>

Closing staff are SO RUDE. They werent wearing gloves when they were touching food. I waited 45 minutes with two people in front of me. I jokingly said they didnt turn my blizzards upside down, (they were quite soft) and he just scoffed. Said I could come in and get another one. I said I'm not from Antioch. He gave me a blank piece of scrap paper and wrote "I.O.U." on it. No joke. My husband went back and he said hed give the money back, because he didn't want to make another blizzard. Be a good sport and give the customer the coupon. I get you hate your job, your life, whatever. Dont ruin peoples nights.</review>

Food is good but they do not seem to know when they close.  Website for DQ says 930 but they start sending people away at 9.< /review>

No, im not exagerating this number, seven consecutive trips spread over several years, and they are always out of chocolate. Its like when fast food tells you the shake machine is broken, they just dont want to give it to you. If this pattern has existed for several years, maybe theyd just order more chocolate?< /review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
My daughter saw an Andrea & Leo dress she wanted to wear for prom.I searched the Internet for places to purchase it. I came across Mia Bella the Label’s beautiful website. I notice the price was lower than anywhere I could find and she offered 15% for first time purchase and free shipping!! I called and spoke to Debbie the owner. She was so kind and helpful. Answered all my questions. I placed my order , it quickly shipped and arrived less than a week later from California to Tennessee! The dress is even more beautiful in person and it arrived in a lovely garment bag. My daughter adores the dress and our experience with Mia Bella The Label could not have been any better. We will definitely order from Debbie again! Thanks so much!

Where do I even start?? Debbie and her team are amazing!! Let me just say not all stores where as nice as this one. Debbies staff was great and Debbie herself was very patient with me. I tried on two dresses over and over again because I couldn’t decide but she was never pushy. Her advice was honest and she also has a good eye for her gowns and what compliments each body type. I felt confident in my purchase and never once was she persistent not even her team. Her seamstress was very kind and very sweet and took direction well she wasn’t rude what so ever as others I’ve encountered for past events. The quality of the dresses are great I’m obsessed with mine I can’t stop smiling at it! I told myself that if I still feel happy and I’m still smiling after each fitting (because sometimes we change our minds), then that is the one! You will not be disappointed when you come here her dresses are beautiful and her staff is great!! Thank you Debbie and team :) !!!<//text>

<Text>LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! I had taken my daughter to a million places before finding Mia Bella. My daughter is very picky and she couldn't find the right dress for her Senior prom.  The owner knew exactly what she wanted and ordered it for us. She was AMAZING!! I wish I would have come here first!   My daughter loves her dress and can't wait for prom!< /Text>< Pictures>

I brought my daughter in for a bridal appt. we had the best time. She was very accommodating. She had so many perfect dresses. My daughter found the one perfect for her. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience. I definitely recommend not only for bridal but for prom and formals.<//text>

I brought my daughter Elizabeth in today to buy a dress for Buchanan High Prom.. even though the store was busy, they made us feel welcomed, staff cleared a dressing room for her, they hand picked dresses for my daughter to try on. Her dress is absolutely beautiful. We're so happy we came. I highly recommend Mia Bella.< /Review>

My first time buying a formal dress for prom and it was quick and easy going. Due to COVID and the last minute knowing of prom dates they accommodated to all the people coming in and helped out with dressing rooms ASAP. The employees even gave suggestions to dresses when they were short on staff. Will definitely go back!< /review><rating>5< /rating>< user_id>

I am not sure how there could possibly be negative reviews especially about customer service. Debbie was amazing!! She fit me in for an appointment quickly when everyone else was booked yet she never made me feel rushed. The only store I went to where she actually helped me get into the gown .. not just clip it. And her feedback was kind thoughtful and honest. She is not cheesy sales type she is warm and helpful type. I was so scared going here because I’ve been before with friends and their gowns are gorgeous I never thought I could afford it she was so respectful of my budget and made sure I found my dream dress for the price I felt comfortable with. I rarely write reviews but Debbie is fantastic and not just trying to push you into a dress to make a sale. Her dresses are of a quality and style you will not find anywhere else. If you want high end fashion you have to go here!!!! Thank you so much Debbie your service was beyond amazing.</Review>

<Text>The owner was very rude. Don’t waste your time!
(She will also reply to low reviews and try to justify her clear attitude and poor customer service problems with false information...in my friends case she already had a fitting room but had questions about the dress because it was stained. Before even listening to the rest of what my friend had to say and what we were told by an employee she was rolling her eyes and raising her voice!) If five different people are reporting the same problem about you Debbie there is clearly something foul on your end... Hope you business gets better soon!

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I just want to give Debbie a huge thank you!!! You went above and beyond for me and my bridesmaids. I found a dressed that I loved but wanted a little bit more and Debbie said she could make whatever I wanted happen. She help me creat the dress of my absolute dreams by adding a few little add ons. She also showed me an absolute stunning dress to do a dress change and it was absolutely beautiful/sexy!! All around so many compliments on both dresses! She also took great care of my bridesmaids. My maid of honor lived out of state and had a horrible experience at another boutique online and they wouldn’t do anything about so when I told Debbie she got on the phone and ordered a dress right away for my MOH got it rushed, gave her a discount just cause she had to buy a second dress since the first one didn’t work and it WASNT even Debbies error or her boutique but she felt like it still wasn’t right.  Just goes to show how amazing she is and is willing to go above and beyond for her brides. Mia Bella hands down has the best dresses in town. Thank you again Debbie for everything you did!< /text>< pictures>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Walked in to look for bridesmaids dresses and the lady sound so annoyed of her job, I asked her a couple of questions and she sound like I was supposed to know the answer smh! Wish I can give them a negative start not a one star.

Ps. The owner likes to comment back and write false information when she knew...that just because your under staff doesn’t give right to have an attitude like that!! Furthermore, saying that you asked my price range you didn’t say that at all. Obviously by the looks of your ratings doesn’t look good and I’m not the only one.

I went next door and wow difference between customer service she was able to help me and answer all my questions with a good positive attitude I felt like I was being taking care of, also she was too with another customer that had an appointment and also she was by herself. she was still able to give good customer service. Go to LBD much better store then Mia Bella.< /Text>< Pics>

I don’t usually take time to post reviews, but you’ll understand why I posted this. It’s about little in depth but I’ll focus on facts.

1. The bride made an appointment, showed up on time, and then was told she never scheduled anything. She’s very detail oriented and told us about it weeks in advance.

2. Once we walked in, the owner did not welcome us or bother asking if we needed help.

3. The owner followed one of the girls into the restroom. No, not to sanitize after use, but to somehow “check“ something?

4. The owner told one of the bridesmaids, after the bridesmaid had already decided to size up, that she should “lose a few pounds.“ I’m pretty sure our bodies are our business.

5. After a bridesmaid posted a review about her experience, the owner implied that we did not want to spend more than $200 on a dress when in fact we were looking at dresses that were $350+. She stated that they were not in the color we were looking for.

Subjective View:

The owner was very standoffish and condescending. I understand Fresno’s market, but if we couldn’t afford to be in a wedding, we wouldn’t be dress shopping.  She didn’t offer any help and instead kicked us out after about 45 minutes of being there (for no apparent reason). It’s rude of her to imply that we only had a budget of $200 when we, in fact, walked over to Little Black Dress and each purchased dresses OVER $200.

I’m very glad we walked across the street because honestly, Little Black Dress really turned our entire day around. She had the best service we could’ve possibly asked for.

For future brides, this establishment has decent dresses but it’s honestly not worth the stress or hassle of having to deal with an indifferent and incompetent owner. There’s enough on your plate.

To the owner, I hope you learn how to better navigate circumstances when you’re the one unprepared. I also hope that your customer service improves for EVERY person that walks through your doors.< /Text>

<Review>I have never wrote a review before but if I was able to give this store zero stars I would. It obviously took A LOT for me to write this review & I DO NOT RECOMMEND!! During my encounter was with the store owner the whole time and did not have a pleasant experience from the moment walking in. As a bride I was trying to have a wonderful experience helping my bridesmaids find a dress but the owner did not make it enjoyable at all. The moment walking in I advised I had an appointment that was booked weeks in advance and gave a head count of how many bridesmaids that would be attending at that time. To the owners dismay and disorganization she had no record and I had to physically show the confirmation and proceeded to blame one of her employees who booked me. As a store owner the ideal response would be apologetic and try to accommodate for their own errors. Dismissing their own errors we began pulling our own dresses and began trying on dresses in hopes we would get somewhere. As a bridesmaid walkout of the fitting room she was unpleasant with the fit and suggested a size bigger to be more comfortable and the owner had the audacity to suggested to lose a few pounds. For any ladies considering this place the owner only carries sizes for the “ideal” body image of a runway model. The experience that I had with the owner is judgmental, prejudice, and discriminates on her own opinion and views that we were minorities and could not afford any of the dresses at the store. When that was far from the case. As a bride I wanted to keep my bridesmaids at a reasonable price point and the owner failed to ask to try and better assist potential customers. It became an issue to the owner when she found out our price point which should not be an issue at all or a factor into how you treat your customers. I quote word for word from the owner  “The fact that your group didn’t want to purchase dresses above $200 is the real issue.” That goes to show the attitude, disrespect, and demeanor you will get from the owner when you do not fit her standards to who she profiles to be suitable as a certain social class. The issue was not that dresses were to expensive and could not afford to go over. That is far from the case. It continued when the owner told us to hurry up because she had other appointment and dismissing my party and appointment I originally booked. So the real issue here was not us not being able to afford the dresses it was the multiple negative encounters with the owner. We do not want to promote a local business that does not deserve it for treating customers poorly and disrespectful.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1598772154416, 'text': 'After you were accommodated, tried on over 15 dresses and were happy until you heard pricing I am sorry that you feel falsely accusing someone makes you feel justified in this negative review.\nI am almost 70 so I don’t understand the ME ME generation who uses social media to get their way even if it means lying to do so.

<Review>DO NOT GO HERE!! This place honestly deserves 0 stars. The owner was super unprofessional in her responses to reviews but I decided to look past the online reviews and visit the store in person. Immediately upon arrival the owner was completely disrespectful and made snarky Unprofessional comments about our sizes. FAT SHAMING, CLASS SHAMING, COLOR SHAMING. There aren’t enough words to explain the shocking disservice we received from here. Luckily we were able to find better quality dresses AND service at the Little Black Dress across the street. And when we did find a better store, she accused us of not being able to afford her dresses. DO NOT GO HERE!!!!< /Review>< Resp>

My future sister-in-law was feeling reluctant to go try on dresses during the current climate in fear it wouldn’t feel as special or memorable (in the way a bride-to-be hopes). However, the sales consultant that helped us at MIA Bella wiped away that trepidation. She was genuinely positive with suggestions and guidance and we didn’t feel rushed. We came to MIA Bella because we’ve heard about the quality and variety of gowns and they exceeded our expectations.< /Text>

<review>We had a wonderful experience shopping for a dress for my 12 year old daughter. The dress we bought is for a ball and father/daughter dance. They young girl who helped us was so attentive and sweet. The owner was also kind enough to give us a great discount knowing my daughter fell in love with one of the more expensive dresses. We will definitely be shopping here again for all future formals and proms. Thank you for making my little girl feel like a princess 💞< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I was a customer for 8 years now, but after this experience I’m done. I recently went in with my mom to find a dress, the owner was extremely rude as she always is but as soon as she sees we were actually going to buy a dress her attitude completely changes.... I didn’t find anything for myself, my mom on the other hand did. I told her to wait and see if maybe we can find another. As we were walking out we said thank you and goodnight. She responded with “mhmmm”  and rolled her eyes at us!!! Like I’m sorry I didn’t meet your standards? That is no way to treat any customer.... but we’ll go spend our money somewhere else. And Definitely don’t recommend!!!!</Review>

<Review>My father put a deposit of $215.74 on my upcoming prom dress. Due to COVID-19 my prom was cancelled which was a big disappointment. I was very upset because events were completely beyond my control. Today, much to our surprise Mia Bella The Label store sales people pointed out that at the bottom of my receipt there was a no return cash policy unless returned within 5 days. We never took possession of the prom dress, and therefore a refund was not an option as COVID-19 started much later. Their policy of return articles was printed on the bottom of our receipt, but we were not formerly presented with that policy upon time of deposit. I highly urged any customers in the future to be aware of this policy and not do business with this store as a result of my loss of money. I was also told that i could take out my money in store credit which is completely irrelevant since my daughter has no prom and no use for the gown or any of their merchandise.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I had a terrible experience but I caught the owner in her lies before she cost me to much time,  she took my money a never ordered the dresses and I got them both from Bianca's Bridal in Modesto and Jasmine explained how it actually works, my dress was completely sold out and the Owner of Mia Bella said it would ship the next week IT WAS SOLD OUT!!! She is not at all an honest person, my daughter's dress had only 3 left, 0, 2. and  a 14 we had to get the 14 and I'm having my seamstress completely redo the dress to fit her. Don't trust her!!!!! She waisted 4 weeks of my time I called her 4 times and each time she lied, I never ever write bad reviews, this is my second time ever but I really don't want anyone to have to go through any problems with their special occasion Dresses.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I was very worried about coming here due to such terrible reviews on multiple sites. But I have been so pleased with Mia Bella. Monique is seriously the best ever, I love her to pieces. She's been so patient, knows what will look good, listens and truly cares. MAKE SURE YOU SCHEDULE WITH HER! You will not regret it for a second! I have had a total of 3 appointments here (I can't find THE one yet, ugh!). The only negative thing I've had is having to wait 10 minutes for our first appointment, but seriously.. that's so miniscule. And the bride before me was saying YES so she deserved extra time.
Love.
And their dresses are stunning. Couture dresses fit like gloves and make regular wedding dresses look like paper bags. It's bananas< /text>

<review>I said Yes to the Dress!
I walked in without an appointment and two ladies were in the shop, one was the owner the other an associate. They said they would have time to fit me in since there were no appointments that morning! The owner picked out 4 dresses for me and I felt like she did a great job capturing who I am and what would look good in me, along with listening to what I was wanting.
I bought the last dress I tried on then and there she was great with helping me celebrate with those who were with me while I said yes to the dress!
Thank you!< /review>< Pics>

I never take the time to write a review for anything, but today I felt like it was important enough to do so. I was very disappointed with my experience at Mia Bella. While they do have nice dresses, their customer service is lacking. I spent over $3000 on my wedding dress. When I purchases my dress we spoke to the owner about adding lace to the entire bottom of my dress. The owner told me that they would measure and call me to let me know how much I needed to pay. I paid close to $400 in extra lace. Finally, when my dress was in and the lace was added, I found out the lace did not go around the entire bottom of the dress and I had not been informed about this. After they tried to blame me that "I did not order or pay for enough lace" they ordered more. Mind you, after they gave me the run around, and told me "they did not have an answer for me just yet". When I finally got the extra lace I had to pay an extra $100 for the missing lace. Personally, I feel that they should have been the ones to cover the cost to fix the mistake that they made, but oh well what was I to do? Never again will I shop there and I will never refer anyone there either. If you do choose to shop there be careful.</Text>

I LOVE Mia Bella. Do not be discouraged by some of the older reviews.

I made an appointment for a specific dress I saw online, and Chelsy had me try on that dress and a few more with the style I had in mind. My wedding was only three weeks away, and the Mia Bella team assured me I could have the perfect dress by then. Chelsy was awesome. She was so helpful, so excited to help, and had amazing style herself, so I knew I was in good hands. I ended up with a different (better) dress than I had originally come in for.

The seamstress, Rose, did a beautiful job. She had a lot to do, as I bought the floor model for a huge discount, yet somehow she always managed to meet our timeline. And the dress looks unaltered! It's incredible what great work Rose did. She is truly an expert. And the alterations were very affordable!

The woman I'm guessing is the owner was a little cold. She didnt welcome us as we entered the shop or ask if we were waiting for an appointment. This was the only negative I can comment.

Overall, I am so happy with Mia Bella, especially Chelsy and Rose, and cannot wait for my wedding Friday. These women have made this special day even more beautiful, and I am so grateful for their help and hard work! Thank you both for making me the beautiful bride I hoped to be!<//Review>

<rating>2<//rating><Review>My daughter paid almost  $350.00 for her maid of honor gown. It took over two months for the order to come in. We went in to try the dress on and it was way too large. She had lost about 12 pounds but for some reason, the gown was huge.  We hesitated to use Mia Bella's seamstress because of negative reviews, but the elderly women sounded like she knew just what to do. She pinned the dress to a nice fit and we left. A week later my daughter went in to pick it up. She tried it on and it wasn't quite right. The waist was VERY tight. The lace on the chest did not lay correctly and the back puckered. The  seamstress insisted that it was fine and that was the best that could be done. This cost $80.00 for the alterations.

My daughter was frantic because the wedding was two days away. We went to our local  seamstress who knew exactly what to do. She WAS able to adjust/tighten the lace in front and correct the ill fit in the back. The dress hit a little higher in the waist so the tightness of the waist was bearable. This cost another $40.00.

In all fairness, the Mia Bella's seamstress did take a size 14 dress to about an 8, and I know that was really challenging, but she should have made a few more adjustments to make it perfect instead of saying that what she did was all that could be done and send her on her way.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Text>When I was in serious need of good customer service, Debbie the Owner was right there to help me.  I have three daughters with very specific taste and have shopped multiple stores - always ending at Mia Bella, we find the dress we love there every time!  We were able to put a deposit on the dress and make payments prior to picking up which was very convenient.< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Okay, so I am normally a patient and understanding person; however, I have reached my limit with this store. Here are the facts:

I had a fabulous day picking out my dress--staff was polite and professional.

I moved away from Fresno (350 miles away from Fresno, actually).

I scheduled a time to try on my dress 10 months later, drove 6 hrs to Fresno on a Saturday, only to be told that my dress had not arrived. There were no calls made to warn me, no attempt at all. I was given 2 bottles of champagne and that was that. Nothing else could be done according to the store.

Upset, I later called back and asked what else could be done. One person (a floor assistant I'm assuming) said it wasn't her fault my dress wasn't there--I thought, "well duh!! That doesn't make me feel any better." Called again and got the manager, who gave me a tiny discount and apologized.

I decided to let my fiancé go back to our home by himself while I would stay a little longer and hopefully be able to get my dress. I had to rent a car to drive back which cost me $91 and more than my store discount.

I was called Tuesday and told the dress was in the store and to head over to try it on. I worked with, Rose, on my alterations and pinning and she told me the alterations were separate from the dress price and then I said I needed to think about it before I confirmed my Thursday pickup time--also the day I would try to travel home. From the front desk, the manager said, "Rose, why are you pinning it?! If she has to think about it, don't start pinning the dress." Her tone was condescending and bold and I responded, "I'll pay for it, thank you," matching her tone.

I'm dishing out $1,500 for a wedding dress and she has the audacity to make a statement, suggesting I cannot afford the alterations? Excuse me?! This is supposed to be a happy time and I have only been annoyed and offended by this store's so-called, "professionals."

The quality of the Allure dresses are wonderful but purchase with caution and with adequate time to accommodate the lack of professionalism. Also, have some champagne and a big glass of patience before interacting with these, "ladies."

Rose and Monique were pleasant, for the record.< /Review>

<Text>Do Not Shop Here.

First of all hours say open til 6pm. They were closed at 540pm.

Secondly the owner of the store yelled at me at the top of her lungs because we pointed out the fact that the alterations we paid $85 for were incorrect. She said “well your dress was $99 dollars somget over it.”  First of all the dress was $199 and the alterations were $85 bucks. Why pay for something that isn’t right? Then the owner pulls out a needle and thread and says she is just gonna “stitch” it up right there.  We asked her to “PUT THE DRESS DOWN AND STEP AWAY” haha but seriously the owner is a lunatic and I wish I read other reviews because we are not the first customers who have had stories like us.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

There was a certain dress that I've had my eye on for months and they had it there! My consultant was Shelbie and she was awesome!! She pulled dresses similar to the one that I liked and listened to what I didn't like.  We talked about tacos and food in between dresses and it made me feel comfortable. I had another appointment that day at another place and those consultants weren't listening to a word I was saying.  The store closes at 4 on Sundays and we called them at 3:42 to ask if we could go back one more time.  Shelbie was there waiting with the dress all ready to go and I said yes to the dress!! The customer service is awesome, the dresses are gorgeous. I don't know what people have against this place.<//review>

<Review>worst experience ever. we were looking for a prom dress and expected mia bella to be the place to find it since ive heard such great things. nope. walked in looking for a dress with no guidance from an employee yet another customer went in behind me and was treated so well. the employees stopped what they were doing to help this customer whereas im here struggling to find a dressing room. i ended up asking the employee and was given the nastiest attitude, i was wondering “is it because of my race? are they treated better because they’re white?” i tried on and asked the employee to assist me with the straps and she kept saying “no that’s how it’s supposed to be” continuously but no ! a dress shouldn’t be uncomfortable ! my friend ended up helping me. moral of the story. they discriminate based on appearance.<//Review>< Rating>

<Review>Had a Great Experience here. I found my wedding dress here. Staff is professional and extremely helpful. Chelsey made me feel like i was a beautiful bride and bery knowledgeable about all the different designers. It's important for me to get great costumer service when im spending a lot of money someplace and from the beginning everything went GREAT. She even popped a bottle of Champagne for me and my friends/ family when i said yes to a dress. Ultimate bride experience.

<Review>My good friend had just gotten engaged and we were shopping around for wedding dresses together with her family. Mia Bella Couture (Fresno location) treated my friend terribly and unprofessionally. When picking out dresses to try on, the attendant never took her measurements, only giving her size 0's and size 4's. My friend is very sensitive about her weight, and though she protested that she could not fit in those sizes, the attendant insisted there were ways to still get them on (though did not elaborate and left her alone to figure it out herself). So, convinced that she was supposed to be able to fit into the tiny dresses, she tried and couldn't, and broke down into tears. When she was finally able to pick out a dress she was TOLD was within her budget, the attendant then told her it would cost more than double, because she was too big and needed a bigger size (which is understandable, but then why was she told the low price in the first place?).< /Review>< Pictures>

I had purchased prom dresses from Mia Bella at their old location several years ago, and after reading reviews of their new location I was extremely hesitant to go in looking for my wedding gown. Went in for my appointment and ended up finding a Madison James dress and was given a military discount. Fast forward, we went in to just look for a MOB dress and were immediately turned off by how many teenagers were in the place swarming for winter formal dresses. After attempting to look around, we started heading for the door in frustration when the owner stopped us and offered to help. She took us under her wing like no other, and we did leave with a MOB dress ordered. Our dresses came in on time, as expected and then on to alterations. The in-house alterations woman was extremely nice and altered both my mom and I's dress for a reasonable price and quickly. All-in-all, our experience was right as it should be, with little to no problems in the 8 month stint between ordering, picking up, and alterations.</review>

<resp>None</resp><review>I bought an $800 Sherri Hill dress for my fiancee for New Years. It had to be re-tailored twice and it was still a spotty job at best. The dress had torn material at the bottom, the snap came off the top of the zipper and some jewels fell off before she even got to put it on.

When I addressed these issues with the manager, Debbie, her answer was "you can cry all you want, we're not doing anything to fix it" -- After contacting the owner, Derek, he offered to return $45 for the tailoring and backed up their "store policy", basically refusing to do anything reasonable to rectify the poor tailoring and even worse customer service.< /review></record>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Text>I would love to share my experience with Mia Bella from this past Saturday. Please take the time to read my response. My sister-in-law and her 5 bridesmaids drove all the way from Pismo Beach to Fresno to visit Mia Bella with hopes to find Bridesmaids dresses. We were certainly looking at designers such as Sherri Hill and Mac Duggal (which you know cost approximately $500 a dress). We were definitely planning on purchasing a dress since we did drive so far. This is where the disappointment begins. As soon as we walked in the door, a lady looks over her glasses and says in a snobby voice "Can I help you?". Later to find out, this was the owner, Debbie. How disappointing! We continued looking at dresses and are assigned an employee to help. I believe she was new, but wasn't bad at assisting. Half way through trying on dresses we got kicked out of our 1 dressing room because another customer needed to use it. Disappointing again. We decided to stop looking at dresses at this point. We asked the girl who was helping us if she could write down the style numbers of the dresses we liked. She handed us the dresses, a pen, and said "I am in charge of the dressing rooms now, but here you go." We went to the front to sit down and look through the designers books. While sitting there, the owner Debbie, comes out from the back and loudly/rudely yells at an employee because she was not supposed to be touching the computer. I found this to be very unprofessional since customers could hear and down right rude.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

READ: TAILORING! I am appalled at their tailoring. I was in a pageant a couple years ago when Mia Bella was still in it's multiple story building, anyway the staff was wonderful. they were all very young pretty girls who dropped what they were doing when i has a question. My problem.. the tailoring.. I bought a gown from Mia Bella for my pageant and needed it to be fitted. It was a six and I needed a two. I also needed to have some kind of bra support inserted being as my chest is just weird. I'm usually a good full C. So, I do have somewhat of a chest and needed support. Well, when I picked up my dress the slit had been STITCHED open. It was no longer a flowing slit. It was stiff and stitched in a way that it would remain open no matter what. Second, the padding. The "support" that was inserted into my dress was a disaster i cannot even begin to describe it. Two FULL C padding cups had been added to the highest bit of my dress. When I actually put my dress on my boos would actually be WITHOUT any support UNDERNEATH the sewn in padding. I didn't ask for a set of boobs in my dress, I asked for support. I asked what they could do about it, and I was leaving for my pageant on Friday and it was Tuesday... They said, "nothing" . I'd have to make an appointment to come back after. My dress was $350... because of he tailoring down on it I am not den able to sell it. I was appalled as I walked down the runway of the stage on my big day and my boobs are freely doing as they please. The dress was too small for me to fit a bra on. In my pictures you will see that the tailoring allowed me to be VERY TOP HEAVY. It looked like I had a 22" waist and DD's from afar.. how embarrassing.. It was my first pageant dress too :/  I am appalled at the service and lack of quality put into these dresses when being tailored. I will return for a dress being as it's one of the best places to purchase a dress, but I will not make much contact with the staff, as well as most definitely have my dresses tailored else where! Be aware! - an upset girlfriend</review>

<review>The owner will say anything and make false promises to sell or have you place an order for a dress. She is discourteous and just plain rude. Beware of alteration prices she tries to quote you, were much more than she leads you on to believe. Such a misleading place.< /review></record>

Owner is rude.  Dresses are overpriced.  Plenty of places in town to get a beautiful dress with friendly service.<//Review>

I had heard that once you bought your dress from this place, customer service would be terrible. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, but they are HORRIBLE people.
I scheduled my fitting for my wedding a month in advance and when I showed up with my bridesmaid and soon to be mother in law, they told me, "we've been trying to reach you...our seamstress is out" although no one left a voicemail or emailed me...they had 4 different points of contact for me!!!! I have called several times asking to speak to the manager and sent numerous emails and no one will get back to me....wow.
They were extremely rude and unprofessional and blamed me for not being in contact! They never offered to reschedule or find another day or time, just "Oh well."
I have three different girlfriends that will be getting married soon and I will make sure they avoid this terrible place that has no idea how to treat their customers.< /Text>

I just picked up my bridal gown today to realize that my veil was missing. The assistant tried to give me the one off the rack and I informed her that it was not the right veil. So she went back again to look and came back with the right one which was all wrinkled. She then tried to shove it in a bag as if it was okay. I as if she could steam it and she said not a problem. I Then thought i should check my dress and of course it was all wrinkled so I asked Debbie the manager if they could steam it again and she said yes. I then told Debbie that I would like to express my concern on how the business was manage. Before I Could express myself, Debbie was YELLING at me telling me that I was "an abusive person"  and that they have bent over backwards for me and that if i wanted something done all i needed to do was ask nicely. She continued to tell me that there was something wrong with me and "good luck with your wedding because if you are like this then you are never going to be happy".  I then reinstated that i just wanted to express my concern i a very calm and quit diemener. She continued to yell at me and not let me speak. She YELLED at me for some time and when i got the turn to speak  i simply expressed that I had concerns about the management of the business. She would never listen to me. Debbie verbally abused  and harassed me. At one point i was afraid that she was going to become violent and physically  hurt me. Allison brought my dress back and tried to mediate the situation. I asked her if she thought it was appropriate the way i was being treated and she said she was sorry but there was nothing else she could do. I then asked Debbie if she thought i was treated the right way and she said " no your right  you should not have been treated this way and i should not have yelled that was not right."
Not once did she apologize. I paid for my alterations and left crying. In the down stairs foyer i called my mother  for help on the situation.  As I stood there crying other customers came down and hugged me and said" that it was not me and that i did nothing wrong and that they had heard stories of this store"
I then asked the security guard for a glass of water and property management. I spoke with sonja who could not do much but confirmed that this was a common problem with Mia Bella. Sonja advised me to go public with my complaint and they way in which i was treated and advised me to go to small claims.
I am simply writing this review because no bride to be should ever be made to feel this and should never walk out of a bridal store with their dress crying.
I also took my complaint to the Del Mar store to find out that the manager there is Debbie's son. Who was of no help and defended his mother and the manner in which i was treated</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I had to go inside to get my car wash code after I filled my tank. There wasn't an option for a receipt. Not sure if that is how they normally operate, but it sort of defeated the purpose of quick and convenient.<//Text>

<text>Great So Cal gas prices but it appears pretty much every.freaking.one who stops here cannot follow simple directions for which way they are supposed to drive into the lanes. UGH! Costco manages this. Other Arco stations do, too. Why is THIS one frequented by clueless dweebs?!?</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< rating>

The usual Arco experience.  No better or worse. Generally cheaper than most big name west coast gas stations. They have a convenience store on site. They are generally clean a and well kept.</Review>

The clerk hit my car and demanded that I turn around although my gas tank was on the side that I pulled in to. The layout is ridiculous and doesn’t allow you to even properly turn around. At that point he blocked me from getting out of my car and continued to be rude after I asked how I was supposed to get gas. I’m short so I can’t get the hose over my car and quite frankly that isn’t even good to do to your car. By the time you try to turn around, people are too aggravated about the situation that they won’t even make room. I WOULD NOT GO HERE. Save yourself the stress and save your car the damage from the clerk and the gas hose and go somewhere else.
There is an Arco right down the street off of Bradford and Yorba Linda which is charging about the same prices, if not $.05 more and there is no line.< /text>< Pics>

They have the lowest gas prices in town, but this results in a lot of traffic because everyone wants it. Plus, the machine wouldn't take my card. I'd rather pay 10 cents extra elsewhere.</review>

I paid cash $40 and was not given a receipt. The lady said that the receipt will be dispensed at the pump. No receipt was given until I learned that the lady on duty should be giving out receipts right away for cash purchases.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The price is lower than the gas stations around
Good but crowded with many cars.

You're really amazing of the rest! What I like about this bistro is that they simply have my sense of taste with regards to espresso and cakes. It is slightly below average, and it's extraordinary. You have the right to be known to many. Sit tight for me to prescribe your support of the entirety of my companions and get back here once more. Thank you kindly!<//Review>

<Text>If you're searching for a coffee shop with freshly made pastries, this is the place to go! It includes free internet as well as a research facility within the coffee shop. Employees/waiters are frequently polite and cheerful. There was coffee on hand, and the cuisine was delicious. It has a reasonable pricing and a pleasant atmosphere. I wholeheartedly suggest this establishment!<//Text>< user_id>

You have my wholehearted and unequivocal endorsement! I am a customer of yours, and I am very pleased with the services you have. Your teammates were considerate and courteous. They were both capable of following the deadlines set by their clients. It's a relaxing and satisfying feeling. This coffee shop is ideal for those who want to spend time alone.</Review>

It was totally a surprising help that I will verifiably recommend to the total of my buddies. A really splendid spot to loosen up and like a sample of flavorful coffee. Fantastic!

This is really a beautiful spot to get some espresso. This spot truly merited more than five-star evaluations. Everything from their staff, inside plans, and surprisingly the administrations were extraordinary. A spot to continue to return to for increasingly more without fail. I strongly prescribe this bistro to everybody.< /Text>

In my neighborhood, I actually find a coffee shop. It's nice and heavy, with a full taste, and it's not as pricey as some of the others I've tried. They provide strong coffee and have helpful service. The atmosphere is wonderful, and the internet access is lightning fast. This coffee shop comes highly recommended by me to anyone who enjoys coffee.<//Text>

Tiago has the best coffee and brunch in Hollywood, hands down! This place has been my DAILY coffee shop for most of 2020 and it's the lovely people who work here that keep me coming back every morning. Tiago is a shining star right at the end of Hollywood Blvd and I can't say enough good things about them. Be sure to get the breakfast sandwich and a cappuccino :)</Review>

Great food! Highly recommend this place. The day we came the waiters didn't come to work on time so they opened up a half hour later and we stood in line until they opened. To make it right they offered everyone waiting in line an amazing cinnamon bun. Everything we ate was fresh and delicious. Will be back! Great pastries and food.</text>

Not only is this spot downstairs from where I work, it's super dope! The vibe of the place is on point! Great music, a place to come hang out, study, or just take a break from clients. Sometimes I just come down to chat with the owner Lee. Super dope person. We always have great conversations. I highly recommend Art+Science Cafe if your looking for great coffee, tea's, the BEST hand roll sushi, and avocado toast! My go to is the Iced Caramel Latte with Oat milk.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

We loved it all! The parking behind the building they validate which was great. The croissants were great. We will definitely return. Lastly they recommended the chocolate pinwheel and it was also amazing. Great staff fast service. Healthy options< /Text>

Went with a friend before a matinee at the Golden Gate theater.  That whole section of the city can be a bit dicey, so don't go walking around alone.  Use the buddy system!

<text>Been here twice now...If you want to avoid the wait it's best to go like 30-40 mins before they close. The neighborhood is kinda on the sketchy side but the Cafe itself is definitely a gem.

Has really good options both base and topping! Service is super friendly too even late at night. Usually the options for a bowl are either  or pitaya but this has a few other options which were all amazing! I tried the activated coconut base for a change so it would t be too sweet and still loved it. Definitely coming back for more. Wish they expand to other locations eventually.<//text>

Came here for breakfast on a Monday around noon... Wow! There was no wait and we were seated right away. I had The Open Road breakfast and it was nothing short of amazing. The home fries are unlike any I've ever had and the French toast, much like the home fries was also on point. This place is awesome!</Review>

Great cortado, made with oat milk. Good food as well. We had the griddle cakes and the egg sandwich, both were quite good. The service is typical LA service, not terribly friendly but gets the job done.<//text>

<review>I liked this place. Food was very good. Coffee was delicious :) Prices were decent. A lot of seating, inside & outside. Like the decor. It does need improvement on organisation. They don't seem to be in sync with the orders being sent out to tables and the kitchen. I received potatoes which were not mine. They happened to be from the previous customers and they already had left. When the waiter brought them to me, am like where's the rest of my food? Am I supposed to just eat the potatoes without my eggs? I mean why would you bring just a side of potatoes when I have nothing on the table? Makes no sense. Anyways, for the most part customer service was not bad. The cashier was very nice and waiter was nice too. It seems they might need to hire more staff because the place does get pretty busy. I would give this place another shot.<//review>< Pictures>

Not living up to the hype - was good, it was a good breakfast but not worth the long line down the street wait. This might be one of those when you see others waiting, it must be good! It was ok, nothing to rave home about... and I love a good breakfast/brunch trust me!<//text>

Can't believe I've never done a review for Tiago Coffee Bar + Kitchen!! I've been coming here since I was a kid.
They have an awesome selection of drinks with unique flavors. Their breakfast food is incredible! My favorite is the lox, they give you a ton of salmon and it comes with a huge delicious salad. They offer a wide range of meals, everything I've tried has been really great.
This is a staple in my breakfast outings!
You can also come in and just order a drink and small snack from the coffee bar.<//Review>

Was invited here to try their chicken sandwich! I must say it doesn't disappoint. The chipotle spread on the sandwich is very good! Very flavorful. I do wish the chicken was a bit spicer.  other than that the bun was just right amount of sweet and other ingredients were on par! Good food made with love and employees are very carful with your take out orders.</Text>

The outside seating area is really nice. You see the tall Palm trees against the blue so Cal sky. Very California.
The Darjeeling tea was nice. They hang the tea bag with a stick which was a nice touch.
The chorizo burrito was really good. Try it for breakfast.
It's a bit on the expensive side with a hot tea and a latte running up over 11 bucks but given it's Hollywood, it's normal</text>

Was invited here to try their chicken sandwich! I must say it doesn't disappoint. The chipotle spread on the sandwich is very good! Very flavorful. I do wish the chicken was a bit spicer.  other than that the bun was just right amount of sweet and other ingredients were on par! Good food made with love and employees are very carful with your take out orders.</review>

Hidden gem sitting in plain sight. Bland looking exterior disguises the cute interior. Lots of outdoor seating and plenty of power outlets everywhere. Staff are always friendly and remember you. Macchiatos are good. Apple Pay works here, so you can leave your wallet behind and be fine. Great place to get some work done.< /Review>

<date>1555226899246<//date><Text>Had the veggie burger with a side of potatoes and cold brew with oat milk (made in house!)

The coffee was fantastic and the milk was delicious. The burger was tasty but crumbled apart very easily.

That's my only complaint. Crumbly patties.

Let's talk about the potatoes for a minute... hands-down the most tasty thing I've had in a while. So crunchy on the outside with the perfect amount of rosemary and salt.

I'll have to get a double order next time.

I was chatting with some staff and they were the friendliest people I met all day.

Special shout out to ya bobsledding boy, Doc. He was so nice, happy, energetic, and just all- around great customer service.

Would recommend to everyone. Loved it.<//Text>< Pics>

Yummy food, large portions. The cafe looks a little outdated and creepy from the outside but it turned out to be a good place.< /Text>

This place was absolutely wonderful!!! The staff is so helpful and lovely. One of the staff members even gave me a second cup of tea, even though I didn’t ask for one. I had a great experience. I highly recommend it to everyone!!< /Review>

This is some of the best coffee in LA. But why in god’s creation can they not figure out how to vent their cooking smoke? You will smell like the sour oil smoke for the literal entire day if you spend more than 5 minutes inside. 2 stars because you can sit outside. But come on Tiago, figure this out.<//text>

< review>
I like this place very much. Reasonably health conscious food, but thoughtfully put together and always flavorful.
The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that it seems a little pricey to me for a place where you order at the counter and they bring it to your table.
However, it is central Hollywood and that may simply be the name of the game in this part of town these days.
But for a cup of coffee or breakfast or lunch, It is still one of the best options in the neighborhood for real food.</review>

I write for a music and coffee blog called Crooners In Coffeeshops, in which I interview local musicians at local coffeeshops. My writeup reflects the positive experience that I encountered at Tiago on our interview date.

Classic favorites and Angelino culture collide in the form of Tiago Coffee Bar + Kitchen’s food and drink offerings. Local and organic ingredients are the focus of a plethora of soups, salads, sandwiches and (mostly) all day breakfast recipes. While you’re drooling over their menu to see what you want to order, help yourself to one of their many freshly made, perfect temperature caffeinated beverages. I’m always a fan of their Ganache Mocha, because life is too short not to have a cup full of liquid chocolate!<//text>

This is an awesome little express breakfast and lunch location. There are plenty of healthy options and good dishes at fair prices.

They have a solid coffee selection in addition to fresh squeezed juices.

Tiago outsources their bakes goods from two separate bakeries; I ate a warmed up chocolate croissant and it was delicious.

The steel cut porridge is incredie and you can take everything to go if you're in a rush. Friendly, quick staff.</text>

Tiago's does not catch your eye when you pass in front of it..But if you try it,you will be completely satisfied.There were many choices of breakfast dishes,regarding eggs, yogurt and coffee,all of which seemed nice..
Worth a try if you live nearby..< /text>

I LOVE this coffee shop! They have great food, coffee, and sweets! The service is always great! Staff seems happy and are all very friendly! While there might be a line sometimes, it moves quickly! My order is always made correctly! I love sitting outside and watching the tourist walk by! This is my go to place and I highly recommend!< /text>

Tiago raised their prices! My cold brew went up a dollar today. I used to go every day, but now I am going to need to stop because it adds up to thousands of dollars every year. I love their staff team, and their food is good, but they should have a customer loyalty program.</text>

Usually I love this place… But to be closed at 3 PM on a Sunday with no notice to any of the regulars is disappointing. I guess you never knows when it lll be open or not. May have to start going somewhere with more reliable hours. Since the ones on google maps (when it’s not a holiday)aren’t accurate</Review>

Great place to eat or have coffee in Hollywood. So great to have healthy & vegetarian options. A long que to order, but lots of people around so it had a good vibe. Cool interior design. Coffee was great. Definitely will come again.<//review>

<pictures>None</pictures><user>116307970473528443877<//user><text>Was treated extremely rudely by staff and told by them they didn't appreciate my "attitude". My "attitude" was that I ordered an 18 ounce americano which the cashier assured me they could make. The barista guy handed me a quad shot of espresso in an 8 ounce cup. He first lied and said that's they only have one size cup. Then the manager came over and started telling me it's just the way they do things and they would not give me a larger cup with more water, I could have a large coffee (for five dollars I'd already paid) or get my money back. Finally when I was not happy with either option she said she could add more water to the espresso in the small cup at least, and as I was taking a second to think about whether I wanted this she declared she was just going to refund me. I asked to just add the water to the little cup then, to which she SNAPPED at me that she'd already offered me that and that she didn't appreciate my attitude. I don't appreciate YOUR attitude! You're extremely rude and that unfortunately seems the default attitude by some of the employees here. Not all of them, some of them are very nice and I do not want to paint all of them in a poor light just because some of the staff has an attitude. It seems the management is not overseeing customer service as can be seen by other reviews with similar complaints.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Went for lunch and had the turkey and mozzarella sandwich.  It was so good.  And tried a few bites of a friend's beef brisket sandwich ... heaven!  And went back the next morning for Eggs Benedict.  Awesome!<//review>

Great place and the friendliest staff. Great excellent coffee. Only 4 stars as the breakfast options could be expanded. Perhaps healthier vegetarian and more type of egg options.< /text>

I didn't like the oats because they were made on not very good soy milk, but we also had the breakfast burrito and the granola, and they were both delicious. The chai latte was terrible, don't get it!</Review>< user_id>

<review>If you're looking for a coffee shop that'll have you feeling like a regular after your first visit, go to Tiago! Was visiting on vacation and needed a place to shoot out some work emails. Staff couldn't have been friendlier (and I know friendly, I'm a Texan), and drinks were great.< /review>< Rating>

However, the service....I'd never really had a bad experience here until last time I made a phone order for only a side of potatoes and was told it would take 5 minutes to be ready ( the time it takes me to walk over), I arrive at the till, pay and wait and wait and wait. I heard the cashier ask for my potatoes but no one moved to get them or looked for them, I watched as the workers were telling jokes, pushing each other and laughing. I finally asked one of the very entertained workers if my potatoes were done and he looked at me quite sternly, like I had asked something crazy while he was on break, which he wasn't. He walked over to the cook's window and asked for my potatoes - waited there and kept laughing, did't even bother to inform me that no one had placed the order. 25 minutes for one side of potatoes. No apology, no acknowledgement of their several mistakes.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2bf20f2252b31:0xda8b1c914d8b0895</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Leave the big chain down the street for tourists. This unique coffee shop has all the right stuff and amenities buzzing with the hipsters and regs alike. Features ample outdoor seating and great view of the walk of fame strollers. Very WiFi friendly. Only thing missing? A wait staff.<//review>

Coffee sucked no other explanation.

Food was so bland and lacked basic ingredients such as salt and pepper. I was checking to see if I lost all my taste buds because usually this restaurant is decent.

I ordered the breakfast sandwich + a vanilla almond iced latte. Total came to 14$ and some change - which again is a rip off.

* Side included some rusty thot potatoes *<//text>

It’s a solid place to get coffee, a spot of food and great sitting outside to do some conferencing or work. to think / I’d be a member of WeWork across the road but they don’t let yuppie me have a membership that will let me attend multiple office locations w a hot desk. Well ok I shall continue patronizing excellent coffee shops like this one. Like I said, solid and reliable.<//review>

Great atmosphere and very attractive customers aside from the least attractive homeless asking for money outside. Great food and coffee. Free Cucumber water. Service was friendly average - Oddly they don't bring you your coffee, they'll just come outside to tell you it's ready but they bring you your food.<//Review>

All I can say is- I love Tiago. I walk there multiple times a week with my dog or with friends to grab a great coffee and amazing food. The staff are incredible and will remember you by name and the location is awesome!
My go to's are the: breakfast sandwich, beef brisket, prosciutto de Parma and the breakfast burrito. Everything is fresh, tasty and generally awesome!

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Having moved from Australia recently, I'm always on the look out for a good flat white. I had some friends in town yesterday and we stumbled upon Tiago just per chance as we were in the area.

I got the flat white, and I have to say its the best flat white I have had since being here in the USA. The young female barista knew exactly what she was doing, and it was re-assuring that she didn't ask if I meant "The drink they sell at Starbucks". It came in a 5.5 oz cup, consistency of the milk was dead on what I would expect (its not a no foam latte!). The roast tasted a little darker than some of the more independent coffee places i've been to, which I actually prefer. I'll definitely be making my way back there again!</Text><Response>None</Response>< user_id>

<rate>4<//rate><text>Good coffee, staff were friendly enough. I asked (being a tourist brit) if there was any change for two Americanos (2 x 2.75) not knowing how much tax etc. She said there was a penny change from 6 dollars which I didn't receive. Not that I care about not receiving my penny back, but principle and all that. I asked if that was because of tax and she said, "I guess so". Meh, whatever. Coffee was good and the food looks tasty. Decor is nice too.</text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Nice atmosphere and good great outdoor seating, but the espresso is no good. It's bitter and over extracted. You'd get a similar shot at Starbucks. This is not not craft coffee.< /Text>
