< Review>
I have seen almost 10 specialists for the pain that I've been experiencing in my lower back and have seen dozens of doctors over the years for other injuries and surgeries resulting from being an athlete. Without a doubt, Dr. Enayati is the single best doctor I have ever had. He took extensive time to talk both me and my family through my complicated diagnosis, the implications of it, and the next steps. He was honest with me about the severity of my injury, and was also able to convey the info in a way that was direct but not stressful. I couldn't recommend Dr. Enayati and his team (who were all extremely caring, competent, and fast to respond) enough. Thank you Dr. Enayati!!<//Review>

As always, I had a great experience at Dr. Enayati’s office. From the person answering the phone to each and every assistant, nurse, anesthesiologist and Dr. Enayati, all are exceptional. Dr. Enayati personalizes each patient’s experience and does innovative procedures that other pain management physicians don’t. He has greatly enhanced my life with his skills. Thank-you, Dr. Enayati for setting  the tone!<//text>

The first doctor I ever went to that could have easily sold me his solution but recommended that I go to another doctor that could better help me.

Starting with the receptionist Nancy she is a pleasure to deal with very nice, courteous, and helpful. Peter is a wonderful young man who is thoughtful, caring, nice and helpful. What can I say about Dr. Enayati very nice, patient, explained everything to me and took the time to also speak with my son about the procedure and answered any question he had with a smile on his face and he took care me like if I was family and not just another patient, never rushed and took his time to make sure I was happy. I am extremely happy and sincerely grateful with everyone at The office will always recommend other who experience my pain to go there, Thank you for everything.</review>

{'time': 1523055730841, 'text': 'I am sorry to hear that you feel you were treated unfairly. We do our best to ensure that every patient has a positive experience when they come to see us, and take every complaint seriously.\n\nWe do have a strict policy regarding patient no-shows and same-day cancellations, because we want to ensure that our patients are able to see Dr. Enayati as soon as possible. If someone is not able to attend their appointment due to another commitment, we ask for at least 24 hours’ notice so that we can offer that time to another patient. Dr. Enayati spends more time with each individual patient than most specialist doctors, so even a single patient no-show can leave a noticeable gap in our schedule––time that could have been given to another patient in need if we had enough notice. We hate telling someone who is suffering with pain that they need to wait for weeks to see Dr. Enayati and then have someone else not show up to their appointment that same day––we want to be able to give that slot to a person who needs and wants it! Although we do not enjoy charging late fees and no-show/late cancellation fees, we have found that charging a nominal fee is the most effective way to minimize wait times and ensure patient access to Dr. Enayati. All patients are notified about these policies when they first come to our office. And of course, there are specific circumstances, such as sudden illness of a patient or family member, when our attendance fees may be waived.\n\nWhenever a communication issue or other misunderstanding does arise, I always encourage patients to come to me to discuss it.  I have found that when everyone is honest and upfront about what is going on, it is very rare for us to be unable to come up with a solution that works for everyone.\n\n-Craig'}< /Resp>

Money Grab Operation!
I couldn’t make it to an appointment and got dinged with a late fee. I explained my situation as to why I couldn’t make it and asked that they waive the fee. The receptionist said she spoke with the doctor and he was willing to be fair about it. She said pick a price that you think is fair for both parties. I said fine, let’s agree to half the amount. I paid $60 and went on my way.

I then get a bill for a remaining balance of $60. I call in and explain that this is a misunderstanding and he states that, “The doctor would never agree to something like that.”  Rather than keeping his thoughts that don’t have merit to himself, he blurts it out, which in turn makes me the liar. Maybe the front desk was lying about the doctor saying something like that. However, I'm not making this up!

He tells me he’ll talk to the doctor and get back to me. Then he calls back and explains that the doctor and the receptionist both deny what I’m saying and that you still owe the $60. Forced money grab!</Review>

Class and care, Dr. Enayati has been a god sent. My pain has been an ongoing challenge for me, and Dr. Enayati has managed my pain  aggressively, reducing my pain by nearly 50% from where I started. Absolutely gets to the source of it. Friendly staff and I have never waited to be treated. Will not go to any other Dr. regardless of insurance or cost. My well-being has always been top priority to him. My quality of life has improved since the 1st day I met him. Thank you again for always being the best you can be!< /review>

From first glance, to the end of the initial procedure, i was highly impressed to say the least. From his friendly and helpful staff, the atmosphere and presentation of his practice, and Dr. Enayati himself being an extremely warm, intelligent and enduring individual i could not recommend him enough. I went in for one small procedure to relive pain that could not be relieved for several months, and in that one procedure much of my complaints were solved.</Review>< Pics>

Dr. Enayati has exceptional bedside manner! I was really taken aback by how much time he spent on my consultation: his sincerity and thoroughness is truly unparalleled. If you’re looking for a pain doctor that diligently analyzes their patients’ conditions with utmost care and precision then definitely make an appointment with Dr. Enayati! His staff is very kind, intelligent, competent, and equally as thorough. The healthy lobby treats, coffee, and ritzy location are also a plus. 😋 10/10 would recommend !</Text>

DR. ENYATI IS THE BEST!!!! I had shoulder pain for 2 months straight before finding him, I am in my mid 30's and was worried that it would require surgery. The Dr. had me get a ct scan, he saw the issue, and fixed me with 1 shot. I couldn't be happier, I'm back to working out and going about my day without an ounce of pain. Its such a relief. He is so professional, kind and really helps you understand the problem. The staff there is so helpful, Gabby and Anna at the front are the best. Hopefully I don't have to see him again soon for pain, but if I do I am relieved to have found him.  - Billy Del Puerto</review>

<text>I have had several ketamine infusions for CRPS.  They have helped so much to bring down the severity of the pain so I can tolerate what I do have.  Dr. Enayati said to me this last time something that really stood out to me. He said, “When I first met you, you were living in pain.  Now you are ‘living with’ pain.” That is so true.  Although I hope this to one day go in remission, if for just a while, I know realistically this is with me the rest of my life. I try not to “what if” the future anymore.  Dr. Enayati has given me confidence that he will help me live with this pain and it won’t become unbearable.  He cares and knows what to do to help.  He is a master as what he does. I thank him so much.  His staff are wonderful, courteous and caring.  Gary has called me to see how I am doing and answers any questions by email promptly and with concern for me. Nancy at the front desk is always polite and professional. I love this entire office. It is well worth the drive from Murrieta.  I don’t know what I would of done if I had not started seeing Dr. Enayati.  If you are in any pain, please make a consult.  You won’t regret it!!

<review>Dr. Enyati is a brilliant pain specialist who provides steroid injections -- epidurals -- which can be done 3 or 4 times a year for people with chronic pain.  He has always been successful in treating my pain.  This particular treatment falls in the category of an art, not a science, in the sense that success is determined by the skill of the doctor.  There are a lot of doctors doing this who have little or no ability.  Dr. Enyati is extraordinarily gifted and skilled in this treatment.  He also provides anesthesia during the injection, which is especially important to me.<//review>< gmapID>

<review>Son of a gun! I can actually move my hips without any pain! Now I can get up from a chair without pushing on anything and feeling anything but muscles moving. Dr. Enayati said I'd probably have pain the day after the procedure. But nothing so far. I'm still waiting. The only problem is this ridiculous case of hiccups that from time to time keeps jumping up. My neck is next. Maybe that will stop the hiccups.

"There are no guarantees" is a statement in Beverly Hills Advanced Pain and Spine's consent form. I didn't think there would be a problem. I've had lower back and neck pain for some years now. I had been with the VA and all they ever deal with is drugs. Drugs don't help anything. The VA at least took x-rays and found out I have compressed and fused vertebrae as well as slight scoliosis and lumbar spondylosis.  I've had acupuncture and chiropractic adjustments and those didn't help. So, when my doctor recommended Dr. Enayati I was quite pleased. The visits with Dr. Enayati prior to the procedure were very pleasant. He is personable and caring. The problem I had with the procedure was not with Dr. Enayati but with the VA. I needed to get the OK to use an outside doctor for a procedure they don't do. That took about 2 months. Then I finally had the procedure done. Low and behold the pain was gone! That felt so good. Unfortunately, this lasted only 3 days. Dr. Enayati said the pain would probably come back in about 3 or more months. It did not. It came back after 3 days and it came back worse then before. Whenever I contacted him about it he would say, "It's too soon." I guessed it was too soon to do another procedure. He then sent me to physical therapy. That didn't help much because they had me doing a lot of stretching. I would get a lot of pain in my lower back when I did any stretching even before. What became most disappointing was the letter I got from Dr. Enayati's "Director of Operations," Craig Johnson, Esq. ( a lawyer) saying they are no longer going to participate in Medicare. This rather cold and matter-of-fact letter left me angry and hurt that I'd have to find another way to deal with the pain I'm stuck with having. The office suggested seeing a particular osteopathic surgeon. The only problem there is surgeons usually suggest cutting and I'd have to get the OK from the VA again. The letter suggested getting on the Internet and looking up physicians who take Medicare. This letter also suggested paying out of my pocket. Why else do you think I have Medicare, Mr. Johnson? The office visits are not much different than seeing a GP but the procedures are not.

I was going to give only one star but I like Dr. Enayati. Would I recommend BHAP&S? Only if you've got excellent insurance or a hefty bank account.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< userid>

Dr. Enayati is one of the most amazing doctors I've ever been to. After months  and months of jumping around to various doctors trying to figure out why I was having pain in my foot after back surgery, Dr. Enayati quickly recognized that I had developed CRPS. HIs prescribed treatment course is already starting to push this awful affliction into the background. I couldn't have asked for a more caring, compassionate doctor.<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>This may duplicate the review I started today and which froze this site. I wll try again to let people know that Dr. Enayati is stellar. He is compassionate, personable and actually looks at you when he speaks with you (not at you). He offeres cutting edge therapies but much to my dissapointment they are not for everyone as Dr. Enayati pointed out. I get the feeling he really cares about his patients and their outcome.
Unfortunately doctors are in my life right now. Dr. Enayati is one of the finest.
His offices are cutting edge, beutifully decorated and there is a coffee bar stocked with choices of coffee and tea, fresh Almonds and real Jelly Bellies!!! Although the wait is never lengthy as with some doctors. I always end up with a few Jellie Bellies in my pocket for the road.<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

< review>
Dr. Enayati is the most knowledgeable, caring pain management doctor I have ever met. I have suffered excruciating pain for 6 years after pushing a leg press that was too heavy.

Others doctors had no idea why the injury didn't heal after 4 to 6 weeks. They didn't believe how much pain I was in. I told told all the medical professionals that the pain was in an embarrassing area just to the left of my vulva and perineum and that sitting was extremely painful. None of them had heard of such a long-term condition in this area.

I went to physical therapy, had acupuncture, several cortisone shots, saw a chiropractor , all with no relief.  After 2 more years I was desperate saw an orthopedic surgeon. He misdiagnosed me, resected bone from my left femar and pelvic bone. My body reacted by creating a heterotopic ossification  (pemanent presence of bone in soft tissue where bone normally does not exist). He wanted to do the surgery again and remove even more bone when I told him the procedure was unsuccessful. I was afraid and did not go bavk.

The pain continued so I met with a pain management doctor near work. I told him as I had told everyone else had had several cordison shots asked for a nerve block. He instead gave me steroid injections two weeks apart. This was a waste of my money and time. Also, the shots were painful. I cried and he asked, haven't you had children before?" I hadn't and was embarrassed.

Just before the holidays 2017 I could no longer sit and do my job. I wasn't allowed a standing desk. I had to go on disability. I had been at my job for 16 years and whether people believed me or not I could no longer work.

I searched the internet and was willing to drive any distance for the right doctor.  After extensive research I found Dr. Enayati. He has saved me from a life of pain.

I first met with his medical assistant Peter. He was extremely thorough and compassionate with his questions.

Dr. Enayati came in the room after reading my medical history and Peter's notes. He ask, "Has anyone told you about Pudendal Neuropathy?" In the 6 years I searched for an answer no one had even mentioned it. A week later he did a diagnostic nerve block, totally painless, and confirmed that was my condition. He is now looking for the best surgeon to correct my injury. There are only a very few specilzed surgeons qualified to do it.

If you have pain, don't suffer for 6 years like I did. Make an appointment with Dr. Enayati. Also, his medical assistant Peter, office manager Craig and front desk manager Nany are all extremely good at their jobs and compassionate as well.< /review>

Dr. Enayati is amazing. My plantar fasciitis becomes so bad I could barely walk. I went to many different podiatrists and my internist- no one was able to take my pain away except Dr. Enayati. He uses the latest technology and is advanced using stem cells and PRP. After one injection I have been back to running. He’s truly a healer and has wonderful bed side manners.</Text>

<review>As a very active 40(something year old)... I have had many injuries over the years that needed treatment. After a long and treacherous hiking adventure, I had been nursing a hamstring and lower back injury for some time.
I had been receiving treatment from other Doctors, to no avail.
Being new to LA, I asked around for a recommendation as my back injury was getting to the point that I couldn't walk/function normally.
Fortunately, Dr. Enayati was recommended.
The office and staff are top notch and Dr. Enayati took the time to really understand the nature on my injury and pain.
After a short period of time, and a very reasonable bill I might add, I am back moving around and planning my next adventure.
Thank you Team Enayati!<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2b9514392cdb5:0x553bb1c1dbab90e4</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>This is a cool park to come and relax. They also have water obstacles and fountains for kids to play in. Right next to police station and city hall. Although, I got super itchy from laying on the grass, watch out for that! It was either that or from rubbing up against some bush in the park. Watch out allergy people... 👍<//text>< Pictures>

It's a very nice city park with a splash pad for the kids.
Yesterday was our city's annual 1000 flags parade in remembrance of Sept 11th. So there were placed over a large area of the park the thousand flags.
We were there for a picnic that evening and had a really nice gathering with friends and family. Plenty of shade and space for lawn chairs and parking<//review>

A WONDERFUL place to visit for each week of Sept 11. Park is arrayed with 1000 American Flags.
Fun small splash pad in warm and hot months.</review>

It's 2 blocks from home. I've used the large open area to train Basset Hounds and now a Jack Chi. Plenty of room to run and it's well maintained. Bonus: it shares the property with the Ridgecrest PD.</text>

< Review>
I'm assuming this park is the one next to McDonald's...for the most part I like it but , not enough benches, no grass, and no shade really. However, the bathrooms are nice and big and kept clean and there's even a place to charge your phone where the picnic tables are. Lol......oops I'm sorry wrong park. The freedom park behind KerMcGee Center has lots of grass and a nice Gazeebo and pretty new fountain, but that's it nowhere to sit no toys for kids or picnic tables . pretty small really.  Not sure if a lot of people like to go there beinsthat....it is right behind the cop shop.  Just kidding, we love it.</Review>

< review>
I like Forever 21 because it has a great fun choice of clothes for plus sizes and the prices are extremely reasonable. Plus size clothes are oftentimes unflattering but here they are fun and flattering. Employees are helpful and friendly. Two negative points are that it is EXTREMELY difficult to find good bargain clothes as they are only tragedy by color themes rather than by size . This makes shopping frustrating and irritating as you spend a ridiculous amount of time looking for the right sizes. On that end they need to rethink the concept to boost their sales. Their return policy is not good either as if you wear defective item and try to return it even after a few days, they will automatically refuse to take it back, only allowing exchanges or even exchanges. Many sale items are also FINAL sales..Fun store nonetheless to shop at...<//review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Bought some Sandals and wore them in the house for five minutes they hurt my feet ao I changed shoes and when I Tried taking them back the lady at the desk said she wouldn’t take them back. I’m a avid forever 21 shopper and I for one will never spend any money at the stores and I won’t be recommending them. I’d rather go to H&M and spend more money and feel more comfortable about my returns.<//Review>< time>

Store was very messy but employees were trying to fix it. Clearance def needs to be organized by size it was very unshoppable. Didnt even know where the plus size clearance was until last minute. Fitting room was a disaster noone even monitoring it. My cashier was great tho and definetly turned my shopping experience around.< /text>

(Translated by Google) My eldest daughter bought me a short brown skirt and a few blouses that match well. I liked it very much and liked it. Most of them like it if I choose it🤩💖💚🚶‍♀️

(Original)
큰딸이 잘 어울리는 갈색 짧은 치마와 브라우스 몇가지를 사줬다. 무척이나 마음에 들어 좋아 했다. 대부분 내가 골라주면 맘에들어 해요🤩💖💚🚶‍♀️</review>

(Translated by Google) The good, there were many promotions. The bad, they were already in liquidation.

<review>Wait times vary on volume of people. There’s times I’ve waiting an hour to be seen other times I’ve been seen immediately. The staff here is AMAZING always so kind. Yes, sometimes it takes awhile but they really take their time to make sure they get the proper care for you. Dr. Saxman is an AMAZING DOCTOR he goes above and beyond for his patients to ensure their comfortability and actually takes his time to hear you out unlike most doctors. We need more doctors like him. Thank you all staff at Enloe for working.< /review><Name>Michelle Gonzalez</Name><gmapID>0x8083286c77f94b55:0x755356e502ad2569<//gmapID>< Rate>

It has been an hour and a half since I have waited for a simple Health screening that I need for my employer. I have seen patients be helped who arrived after me, and get out already. This is absolutely ridiculous. Any doctor can sign this paper in about 5 minutes, I don’t understand why I have been waiting this long. I was also misdiagnosed here by a female provider previously, and then correctly diagnosed by a provider who took his time and looked in a medical book to help me. Very hit and miss, and don’t come if you don’t want to wait for 2+ hours.
Edit: After waiting two hours, I was called in and told that they do not do health screenings. After I showed clerical staff what exactly I was there for and waiting. I had to leave work and not get paid those hours to sit there for absolutely nothing. I will be making a call to the supervisor and calling the comment line.< /Review>

But the phone operators that I had to deal with to receive my results were beyond rude (I'm being generous). Either they sounded like they hate their job or they're uncomfortable speaking with people on the phone, which is why they seem to have a condescending tone when they speak with you.

The calls were monitored for quality assurance and I hope they're actually enforcing "quality" on their operators. 2 stars.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1611073965851, 'text': 'Dear Daniel, Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

The 125 dollar fee is not the issue . The issue is co vid tests are free so if you have to pay 125 there should not be a maybe as to getting tested or not. Pretty hard to control the spread of a pandemic when monetary gain is the motive. Same issue with Chico immediate care and the list goes on and on.

<Review>Rude screening nurses and staff. Doctors sent me off with my shoulder in a sling and pain pills for a shoulder injury from 8 feet high fall. My shoulder began to freeze in it's joint wearing the immobilizer. I returned and the doctor asked why I came back, I told them they gave me no plan and there was issues with their solutions. They said they thought I would come up with shoulder exercises to regain mobility as I could not raise it more than a foot from my waist. I was maybe a week into the 2 prescribed weeks of wearing the immobilizer. They made no mention of working to regain mobility when they first saw me.

I have had other negative experiences here that I won't bore you with but expect rude and careless staff. Maybe you get lucky and they like you or find you interesting in some way.</Review>< Response>

Been 3 times for emergencies, 3 wasted visits. Just go to the er, these people are rude and are determined to send people off with no help. I tell them i'm expeirencing extreme tetanus symptoms, having my muscles spasm and tense like never before (including my tongue and throat) and she says it could be nerves or dehydration because almost nobody gets tetanus. Then says they arent qualified to test or treat tetanus, but a nurse will shoot from the hip about it freely. Horrible, time after time with these people.<//text>

This visit was at least several months ago, I came across some paperwork in my files today that reminded me of the visit, so I decided to write a positive review.

Nancy was the one that saw me when I came in for a pneumonia. My other clinic awfully diagnosed my early infection as allergies which resulted in it developing into pneumonia. I came in with pretty obvious symptoms and demanded for proper antibiotic treatment, and Nancy was willing listen and further discuss and eventually the antibiotic shot and pills quickly took effect in the next few days and I had a quick recovery. I sent Nancy and the fun nurses (I wish I had their names remembered...) some chocolate afterwards and Nancy called me back too. Overall experience is good, recommended.<//Text>

<Text>Very Polite, however over the years and multiple visits here,  I have been repeatedly given no help. Do not go here for antibiotics or assistance with pain, soft tissue injuries, or things that are not easily proven to their satisfaction QUICKLY. If you do go, scream bloody murder or they will assume you are just fine. Basically you need a bone sticking out to get any help here. I'm not sure if its because I'm an able bodied 30-something, or maybe this is just the state of health care in Chico/Butte county, but they pat me on the head and then send me out the door. Its a waste of time and money. Youre better off at the ER. Only go here if you have a physical injury that can be easily detected via x-ray. My experiences with health care outside of Butte/Chico have been very different.<//Text>< Rate>

<Review>This is the most unprofessional doctors office I’ve ever been to. I had brought my mentally disabled client in just to make sure everything was fine with her leg, which it was. While waiting I can hear the staff and doctor loudly snickering amongst each other and talking badly about us and our situation. I was honestly so baffled that trained professionals were acting like teenagers. It was absolutely sickening and I will NEVER bring myself or my clients here ever again.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<text>Enloe Prompt Care pushes for unnecessary and expensive procedures.
Why is health insurance so costly? For this exact reason. I am a Camp Fire survivor. Our Immediate Care Center and most of our doctor's offices in Paradise burned in the 11/8/18 fire, so I was forced to drive 45 minutes to the next town to seek care.

I have a medical condition that was diagnosed 15 years ago. Over the years if I have a flare up I've been told to go the doctor and get antibiotics to treat it (standard treatment in ALL medical journals), and at the end of 5 days no more problems. This was my first flare-up in 2 years.

Problems started as soon as I walked in the door. I told them I had 2 things I wanted to be seen for - An ongoing medical condition as well as a persistent cough (2 months).

I was interviewed by a triage nurse to see if they could treat me there or if I would have to go to the ER. The triage nurse consulted with a doctor who advised they could treat me at the Prompt Care.

Next, they asked for my allergies. I shared I'm allergic to Morphine and all derivatives...they wrote Oxycodone with Acetaminophen. WHAT??

I shared with the doctor this flare-up was no different than any other I've had in the last 15 years, and the treatment I've always been given. She refused to write me a prescription, told me I needed to leave and check-into the ER, and that she had ordered a CT scan. I requested the antibiotics, as this is my normal treatment,  and told her if no significant improvement was seen w/in 24 hrs I would come back and have the ER CT scan (with an average cost of $2,000). She refused and told me the ER would provide my antibiotics.

She was condescending, refused to listen to me, and spoke to me like I was a child. She kept asking me if I understood what she was saying to me, as she was describing the condition I've been dealing with for 15 years. I assured her I am VERY aware of all the aspects of my condition. That didn't even slow her down. She persisted in speaking to me like I was a child for the remainder of the visit.

When I brought up the cough, again, she listened to my chest, pushed on my sinuses to rule out a sinus infection, and that was it. Exam over. She never looked at my throat, in my ears, or up my nose. Nothing further was discussed or done to determine why I've had a cough for over 2 months. Subject closed.

So in closing, I will now seek out a second opinion tomorrow and in the meantime nothing was done to treat either of the reasons I made the trip down there for.

UPDATE: Saw a doctor the next day who prescribed the antibiotics Enloe Prompt care wouldn't because they wanted to extort thousands of dollars from me by sending me to the Enloe ER for unnecessary services. 24 hrs later I'm on the mend. They should change their name to 'Enloe Prompt Extortion Services'.< /text><Response>{'time': 1560871127594, 'text': 'Hi Kayla,   Thank you for taking the time to let us know about your recent experience.

Came in today because I have a bug bite that's swollen to the width and length of my entire tricep. The NP came in for about 3 minutes, never looked at it but a short glance, never physically examined it, then left. Now I'm left (still) wondering what it was that bit me, why I'm having this reaction and pain, and how anyone and especially a medical "professional" could look at this and tell me it's normal. Aside from her lacking care, her bedside manner was apathetic and aloof, even after expressing my concern. For no one waiting in the lobby, it sure seems they're in a hurry to get patients out of here so they can perform minimal work until their shift ends.

In March, I came in for a migraine. They gave me a medication, prefaced it with a spiel about how common allergic reactions are, then left me alone in the room to have said reaction. When they came back 20 minutes later and found me, they nonchalantly said, "oh yep, guess you can't have that medication!" before telling me there was nothing else they could do, and sending me on my way.

Before that time, I came in with a painful infection and the NP offered me MORPHINE despite that being a listed medication allergy.

It's been made clear to me that the staff here is consistently incompetent and terrifyingly so. I would suggest seeking care elsewhere.<//Text>< time>

<review>First time here. I'm waiting for doctor to discuss x-rays now, and since I've gotten here all the staff has been very nice. Even for having to work on a sunday night they all have a courteous disposition. The staff has worked quickly without feeling rushed on my part. Excellent service and people.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Very nice clean building! We were told it would be a 2 hour wait but got in about 40 minutes after arriving. Very nice staff, gave my daughter a popsicle while we waited for her results. Would definitely go there again!<//Review>

Registration was ok & she was patient but after that it went down hill. Employees including Doctor was putting assisted living facility down. And I had just put my mom in one week ago. This was SO unprofessional. Dr. T. Layne was putting down another business! I don't feel she should be in business as a doctor treating our loved ones!!!!</Text>

I live closer to the Cohasset prompt care but they are closed so I went here instead. I suspected I might have strep throat and so the dr ordered a strep test and it had come back positive. I am so happy that he had listened to my concerns and did what I had hoped to have done just to cross off strep but instead it came back positive. I also was only there for about 2-21/2 hours, but they had still treated me amazingly. Thank you so much!< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>The one star rating comes from my experience in the room. Once the doctor entered, he briefly, and I mean maybe a total of 5 seconds, rinsed his hands with only water, no soap, before examining me. My examination was related to my mouth where I’ve had prior health issues, and the reason for my visit today. Not once were my charts or past health concerns discussed, and the swab test I was told would be no more than 5 minutes. After over an hour waiting to hear back, they clearly forgot about us in the room as the next person to enter was a staff member there to change the bed sheets. The doctor soon followed with my test results, only to tell me there’s nothing we can do, all while the door into the room was wide open with zero privacy.

Certainly the best prompt clinic in town. I've been here for two different limb injuries and an illness (mono), and they were always very professional. No medical office is "fast" but I can say without a doubt that they will see you faster than the Vallambrosa and Cohassett locations, which always seem to be packed with people. My last doctor was very quick to diagnose and prescribed meds that actually helped.< /Text>

Horrible!  You go in, sign in, then you wait!!  Then you get in there you DONT  see a Dr you see a pac or nurse practitioner AND if your lucky they help you. If your not, basically the totally inept person asks you want you want them to do...I’m not a Dr, they are the ones that should know!!  And if your in pain forget it!!

There is nothing prompt, about Enloe Prompt Care, except the registration person. OMG, I was there for 2 hours, for a cut finger. It's not like there were a lot of patients. If the staff spent less time socializing, and more time doing their job, it might become prompt care.  Our strategy was to avoid the long hours and expense of an emergency room, but in the end, it was just as long. And get this, they sent us to the ER. I'll never go back!!</text>

Always welcomed by all the employees and they make really good drinks here. I have tried all the Starbucks in town and Isla Vista has it in the bag by far. They are a little busy but work quickly and get your order to you quickly and right.< /Text>

If you find this kind of a coffee place acceptable my guess is you are really young and have never been in a real coffee house.
Totally plastic --people who work there have zero personality as they are so young and really missed out on anything like Geroge Orwell.
They are what Geroge Orwell predicted--and very immature;
Coffee overall is on the poor side.    Most of the staff probably cannot tell the difference.  OPPRESSIVE.< /text>

<Text>Staff here is completely unprofessional and rude. The girl that took my order is just using foul inappropriate language all. She also did not carry out her job duties and write my name on the cup. She was too busy talking about visiting the f@$&en dentist. They should really dump this poor quality individual and retrain the rest to deter this type of behavior.< /Text>< Pics>

Isla Vista has one of the best Starbucks in town. They always do their best to accommodate everyone and extend their hours during dead week to help students study longer hours. This community driven approach is a type of business every town needs.< /review>

<user_name>Glenn A< /user_name><Review>We were attending a commencement ceremony at UCSB. We arrived a little early so we decided to stop by for breakfast.

We were shocked to see how dirty the front area of the store was when we arrived. There was trash all over the place and looked disgusting. It looked like there was a party there the night before and nobody cleaned up.

Luckily, the mess outside did not reflect the inside of the store. The store was clean and organized. Unfortunately, the restrooms were closed and from the other reviews I have read, this is a frequent occurrence at this location.

Regardless of the inconvenience, we were able have breakfast before heading to the Commencement ceremony.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>The Starbucks is very clean, however, the bathroom did not have soap for over three hours even after the employees were notified. The milk was over steamed and therefore tasted a bit burnt. This is sad because I could only taste the burnt milk flavor over my cinnamon dolce latte. The barista that made my beverage was very rude and when he called out my food he announced, "Sausage sandwich for who ever order that." It wasn't what he said that bothered me, it was more his demeanor. When he finished preparing my drink, he just placed it on the counter said the type of drink walked away even though my name was on the drink. There was about 15 people inside the location total, with about 6 people in line. He was engaged in a conversation with a fellow employee who stopped in so he was not friendly towards any customer when he would give their drinks. Unfortunately, I use to work at Starbucks and thus know what the etiquette should be and how customers should feel when visiting. I did not have that experience at this Starbucks.<//review><gmap_id>0x80e93f68f366fa21:0xbdba19f747f2500b< /gmap_id><Resp>None</Resp>< Date>

(Translated by Google) Staff are friendly but always busy. Lots of people but less than buck in school.

직원들이 친절하지만 늘 바쁘다. 사람 엄청 많지만 학교 안 스벅보다는 적음.</text>

Great little coffee house tucked into a corner storefront. Look for the Blue Bottle logo. Order up front, go outside and wait for your order at the side door. Cute seating area to safely wait for your order. The coffee is delicious. The staff was knowledgeable about the different brews offered and hit the nail on the head when I asked for a dark roast, not bitter.< /review>

The potato galette was unfortunately sold out so we tried the lemon tea cake instead and It was delicious!

Highly Recommend

Newly opened cafe/coffee roaster in Old Town Pasadena with a near cult-like following.

They have a way of bringing out notes in coffee that I’ve never tasted before. It is very good!! I had a Bella Donovan pour over with notes of raspberry and dark chocolate. SO GOOD!! I believe they have a rotating menu on roasts each day so there’s always the opportunity to try something new.

They have plenty of seating outside which is great. Patio seating is sometimes hard to come by in Old Town.<//review>

Love their New Orleans Iced Coffee - made with chicory and already pre sweetened, great taste!

Tried their waffle, was sweet and tasty, highly recommend it.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGk_OzphxUpc9gTFCW8vUq2NPSwcdQaqRQtn6W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcO6aeBq0DJfipJsLGLxSnt9nmF2U-ZvLcVZJ-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAmCG-6juSi6QhSnWJ-6l0gPFlUEkgnDDwBsCX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYzk-DXxq0w-x6412E4vxyQpSozxGClooIenwu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNU28SrTdqrmVguSKDqtxxatgEL-oQNDc-pCJMd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOijnCokFgNKc6JkorKvYEqmjFV8D4CMeUmJWw9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwy11kGTnXUAy6cHptNRLeOwRdYEQ8ngYzfe5E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPz_BI40X6wM3XpUd2TQLjzv4HsOq7-1aGtzFwI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcgbqiBxzlWpvDqmqz1Fzwwi4fo9gnbthv4sBc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOb2bzLLBAVLbWe9Zz10e6YhNmEnsGxuW6CDtVm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDeJj2sKHjnvmqz4O84zWWg3B5o230m6BB4pf-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFjJzYSK3Rtyff6HEbicvLnb9rsTbxGcevyLaj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPp8VXQlyKjJF-Z7674_h4AuA_SozJ8aDMyWu-a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQieotQ22cf3dEPzbKJlkuUZueQKhNiQv5KUqN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcApxbHJllHuPa4bYfl9DP5OQkHODg4r2-Snru=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmkjsXSvJ-cCgIrrSca32Uw0f24SE0O_GOwSWk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c3cf13f862bd:0x211ace6036548099</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Excellent little spot. the inside is clean and minimalistic and the pour over options are plentiful. We have the Kenya roast and I had the mocha and both tasted clean with no bitterness! Smooth, flavorful, and full coffee. Definitely recommend it! Additionally, they have an outside patio that is really quaint and great for intimate conversations.<//Text>

<text>The coffee here is very good, however the staff are not very friendly. On more than one occasion I was treated with disdain. No smiles given...ever, and I’ve been there at least a dozen times. Also, $1.25 for almond milk (as an alternative to regular milk) is ridiculously overpriced.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Sunday morning, came to get a New Orleans.. they pull out a cup to pour our coffee then mid service, he decided to change to a smaller cup. I said wow your gonna change the cup to a smaller size. He said oh that size dosent start till tomorrow. Petty. Never coming back if they are that thitsy for less than an ounce of pre brewed coffee. Then he wants to argue and said it would have been 5 dollars. And I point out the sign says 4.25 this went on until he was trying to get the last word. I ended it with so much for the customers always right.dont come here if you want good polite service.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1552951725126, 'text': "Thanks for the feedback and we're sorry to hear about your experience.

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>This place was a fun mom & pop style sandwich and ice cream joint. I got the Italian Salami sandwich, strawberry sherbet and a coffee. This was a quick bite before I went shopping and it sure hit the spot.
It can quickly get crowded with a couple families coming it for some ice cream, but it doesn't ever seem to be packed for long.</Review>< Pictures>

I have loved this place for years!  It reminds me of the soda fountains that used to be in drug stores years ago, except the food is better!  And the servers are ALWAYS friendly.  Great homemade soups, too. And you can get a true Lime Rickey!</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Burr's was a childhood favorite for me and my brothers - always got hot dog sandwiches and ice cream cones. Still love it over twenty years later! Sweet staff, really reasonable prices and a small town feel that make it a great spot for families and groups with kids. Fun and popular spot to celebrate after a swim meet or little league game.</review>< Pictures>

The staff are so friendly, and remember me when I visit no matter how long in between. The food is always fresh, and the lime rickey goes great with every sandwich. A nice neighborhood spot to relax and enjoy a simple lunch.<//review>

<review>I wasn't impressed. My friend and I waited 40 minutes for 2 mini pizzas. Mine was alright (cheese), but they messed up my friends order. They charged for toppings she didn't get. The only adult on premise was not apologetic (one kid looked about 12 yo). We chose to sit outside because the lights were turned off inside. But this left us next to their kitchen window with the boss watching us. I love small owned business, but I was put off by the atmosphere and attitude.<//review>< Pics>

Since I'm gluten free, I was thrilled that they offered a gluten free and cauliflower crust! I decided on the Thai Chicken pizza - not normally a combination I'd have tried, but it sounded really good... Our food arrived quickly (we ordered 2 pizzas since my friend didn't want to take a chance that the cauliflower crust wasn't up to her standards, lol), and we dug in... I should mention that I'm relatively picky about my pizza, as I usually go only to my favorite place back in Virginia, and am not a fan of most pizza place's crust in general. This pizza was SO GOOD!! Honestly it was the 2nd best pizza that I've ever had (right underneath my fav place back east...) - and another great experience there might make Murphys my new favorite since I enjoyed it so much. I ended up eating all but 1 piece of pizza, which I took home and found out it was almost as good as leftover and cold the next morning. So glad we stopped there - YUM!</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNA5fZbK-rQfu3qDJttY_Y4F5mimaOFHsGcQC0K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2a0GOgSHJNvAWE-UH9xOA4N4F71wYaNB5gPve=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUsFccqam_qheR03t7i3ftadGs9lCaWxKiQMyz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x8090bc15d0e51c27:0x7f61f4c3e5f74ac3</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This pizza crust is amazing. Perfect textured and the right amount of sauce and cheese. It is a quality pizza for the price. I live down in Manteca but would definitely make a special trip to have their pizza.</Review>

Moved to Folsom, California last October. My family and I came from Buffalo, New York. New York has the best pizza hands down. But let me tell you this place is by far one of the favorite pizza places I’ve ever been too. The pizza is amazing, always fresh ingredients and super friendly staff. I would literally drive from Folsom to just to get there pizza. Great job guys and girls at Murphy’s Pizza Co!!!!!<//text>

Mountain Pizza!  This place was great.  Family and I were visiting the Murphy's area and found this spot.  Went there to grab dinner about 6.  A lot of teenagers work there but they were all respectful and helpful.  Had the all meat pizza and got to say it was very good.  Only thing is next time will ask for it well done.  Crust was good, sauce has good flavor and the meats seemed quality.  Definitely going back when we visit!  Thanks 😊<//Text>

Good pizza!

We ordered a small 5 cheese bread sticks with pesto dip and a Medium half margarita and half Al Pastor pozza- though they were out of Al Pastor meat, we subbed in prosciutto and bacon. It was great - the crust was perfect and everything was cooked.
For two of us it was more than enough. We ate half  of everything and took the rest back home with us.
Friendly service and the place was clean. Most of the staff used masks and I saw them washing their hands frequently.
They offer to go and inside dinning options. We are out on the table outside near the store.< /text>

<text>Had the most amazing pizza tonight from Murphys Pizza Co. We ordered their Margarita Pizza. It was the best I've ever had. The crust was perfect: thin and crunchy. That was accompanied by a great motezeralla, thin tomato slices, topped with Basil and Balsamic vinegar. Yum.<//text>< Time>

<Review>When talking to the manager he did nothing to accommodate the fact that they messed up the order. The person who took the order was young and took three times to get it right. When we caled to let them know, he fought with us on what we ordered. We have been here at least 10 times. Very disappointed< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>This site is my first choice site.  Of all restaurants I know I like it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to visit this place. Whenever  I feel like having a good dinner, this is the place that comes straightaway to my mind. excellent and varied  food and a rich cuisine.courteous team, and pleasant mood. In addition to that, the charge is modest. I recommend this place with no doubt.</review></record>

Customer service was way below expectations which are already low for a standard pizza place. The food was about average and the price was high!!!</review>

The pizza here is outstanding. It would be nice if their all you can eat salad bar provided some chicken for the salad and defrosted the peas as well!  Other than that I have no complaints about this establishment. I look forward to trying out some of their calzones and other items as well.  If the calzones are as good as the pizza  I will definitely boost them up to a five star rating.</text>

Tasty pizzas and great prices.  The smoothies were refreshing. The place was quite interesting with the giant black board for kids to showcase their drawing, painting, wall art skills. Staff was super friendly.</Text>

<review>It is much quieter than one of the pizza places on main, so if you're wanting to get away from how hectic that can tend to be, try this place. Creative topping & sauce combinations - my wife and I had the thai curry pizza; it was fantastic aside from not having any spice heat to it.</review>< Pictures>

<rate>4< /rate><text>Love the food but it CAN be quite a bit of money for the locals especially who a majority live on a fixed income.  Everyone deserves to enjoy a night out with the family for pizza and these prices may make it difficult to do so.  But that aside the food is excellent and WORTH the price IF you can afford it.  Alot of choices on the menu.  Very friendly staff.<//text>< user_id>

The atmosphere is a bit too dark. The walls are made of chalk board mainly for children to enjoy scribbling. I love Murphy's pizza because the toppings are fresh. Compared to  other pizza joints the veggies are soggy, dehydrated or not enough toppings. I recommended this pizza place for the entire family.< /review>

<Review>Good pizza in the turn of Murphy. It was our first time there. I got the pizza-salad thing. It was a car said in pizza crust. It was yummy. There is an arcade the boys enjoyed, but the games are old and cost 50 cents and a dollar. Too much in my mind. We will go again when in town!< /Review>< UserId.>

Usually the service and quality is great but last nite was subpar.
Our pizza was in the oven, they knew the name on our order, we sat waiting while many other people were helped. The 5-6 minute quote was long over and we spied a box on the oven. I figured it was an employee pizza or mistake because we were sitting right in front of the counter. Surprise... it was our order. Luckily it wasn't dried out but the toppings/quality was not what we're used to. The extra cheese and extra pepperoni we paid for were simply not there.
Murphy's pizza is great overall but last nite was a bummer.< /Text>

<Text>Unique pizza and salad here.  I had the Goddess Piezalad.  Thin crust warmed, with salad stuff inside, almost like a calzone.  Had salami, cheese, olives, and lots of spinach leaves.  Pretty good stuff!</Text><user>106248591600121207759</user>< Date>

<Review>I don't normally write revues, however I feel that I should let you be aware, was aware that average price for 16" pizza at competitive locations range from $16 to $21 after ordering the price of that 16" pizza was $27.85 cents  felt like telling him to shove it,  but after driving 1 1/2 hrs was to tired , so be warned. had to give it a star or it would not let me post</Review>< pictures>

The employees are really kind and the food is really good. The restaurant could be managed a little bit better in terms of efficiencies and cleanliness but overall, a great spot to hang out with the family.</text>

< review>
We have been visiting this place for many years, since it's close by and convenient to place an order to go.  But as of last week, we will No Longer be spending our money there!
The owner was so Rude and Unkind to us, due to the fact that we ordered a pizza to go....and when we came to pick it up, we drove home to eat it with our family.
As we pulled the box top open, we quickly noticed that this pizza, cheese and crust were quite burnt!
It was definitely the color black on most of the pizza in which we ordered the largest size as we always do......
I called to let the staff know that we didn't take one bite of this pizza, and that could we have another one made up......
The owner who is a male, took over the conversation and asked for us to bring the pizza back, we did at that!
When we did bring it back without one bite on it, since we don't like the taste of blackened overcooked pizza,
the manager opened the pizza box and directly told us'
"Well, I really don't see why you brought this pizza back, most people would eat it black like this!!

That was very upsetting to my our family, we will never be back to this Pizza PLus!
It is worth the short drive to buy our pizzas elsewhere.....
So, I would suggest those who order pizzas to go that you take a peek inside first to make sure you don't have to drive back to get a better pizza made!
I don't recommend this certain establishment in Murphys, Ca!</review>

Пица очень понравилась. Персонал не сильно расторопный, часть столов не убраны стояли и не кто не торопился порядок наводить. Но сама пица настолько понравилась, что перекрыла все минусы.</text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>Food was good! I would say the chicken needs to be a little bit more tender. But the meat was great and the tacos were good. I had the fajitas that had the chicken, carne asada and shrimp. I also ordered the menudo although I didn’t eat it for the tripe was grey and not tasty.</review>< Pics>

Yellow cheese on my beans knocked out one star, LOL!
I'm more of a traditionalist.
Raul's is clean and tasty but a bit pricey. I guess that's the cost of being brave and staying open during these difficult times. Thank you!</review>

Paid $12 for a chicken burrito, beans and cheese. Nothing special about it. Last time I paid $12 for a burrito it weighed 5lbs.! This was not worth it. Never going back again.< /review>

PHENOMENAL breakfast burritos!!!! I get the machaca breakfast burrito at least once a week on my way to work! It's always hot. ASK FOR THE "SALSA THAT COMES WITH THE CHIPS!" I wish I knew the actual name for it, but alas, the struggles of being a whitey lol! Seriously though, well worth stopping by if you're anywhere near the area! They have fantastic deals like $5 breakfast burritos and 10 tacos for $15 you're not going to find better prices, better service, and really good food anywhere else!< /text>

(Translated by Google) The tacos have a rich flavor😋
But they put very little meat on them !!! Also the staff is not very attentive because they always get wrong in the orders 😌 and more when you order by phone !!

<review>Tiki lagoon is starting to show some serious signs of age. They are, however in the middle of an electrical upgrade that sets this marina in a favorable light. LOL!  They are installing photo-voltaic panels up.

I just stopped by while driving in the area. It looks like a nice place to camp close to home. $20 for tent camping is a great bargain.<//Text>

Horrible!!! The bathroom was
filthy with blood on the toilets! The showers were dirty. The individual who runs the the campsite was very disrespectful and rude. When we complained about the filth. We were responded to in a very rude manner. Like we were supposed to deal with it. I will never come back here again!</Review>

<Text>I feel the need to update the earlier reviews:
As of May 2013 Tiki Lagoon is under new management.
Shawn has taken Tiki by storm and now that the smoke has cleared
this resort & marina has had a complete makeover, some new staff, equipment,
repairs, paint, security cameras, the launch ramp repaired, and most of all attitude has changed. They have
customer and guest pot luck every third Saturday of the month. They have had a couple of nights with live bands which had great turnouts. I recommend that everyone come see for themselves. I've had a wonderful time each time I've come to visit. Planning to bring my boat here.<//Text>< Response>

I went back to Tiki after working there 20+ yrs ago,  a little while back, I needed a drive to clear my head and found myself there.  It looked amazing,  clean, well kept. The young lady in the resort store was very kind and helpful. Alot of similar places over time lose their appeal due to wear and tear and time taking its toll. Not Tiki Lagoon Resort, keep it up you guys are doing a great job!</text>

<text>The store has virtually nothing in in I couldn't even get a cup of coffee like I used to. I have to have my coffee in the morning or I become a very angry person all day. So I went up to the restaurant no coffee there either. Had to get in my truck and drive to the next Marina to get my coffee. On a good  note the bathrooms are always kept clean love the fact that they are heated. It's also the only place I get cellphone signal on E Dock. The grounds are well kept. But they need to have coffee<//text><Name>Roamer 2u<//Name><GmapID>0x809005deaf24b181:0xa6feac26f4925eba<//GmapID><Rating>3< /Rating>< user_id>

The marina, store, and restaurant are well maintained by friendly staff. However , just 100 feet away, we encountered a gravel pit resembling a graveyard for broken down RVs that may never see the road again.  Upon arrival , we were warned by other guests that exploring the back of the "Resort" could be dangerous due to an anti-social resident allowed to stay as no one is enforcing the rules.</review>< pictures>

< Review>
Although it is old, and after the storm in December took off parts of the roof, this marina has a nice staff, clean, working toilets and laundromats, slips are affordable and best of all; it is legal to have an extended stay here. Hopefully everything will be restored, including the access road.< /Review>

<Review>I am a frequent visitor at Tiki and I am appalled at the review from Shane Philips. I too camped here over Memorial weekend & have nothing but good things to say about my time at Tiki. The staff is amazing and helpful. Mark showed me around the grounds & helped me pick out my sites as well as renting me kayaks and paddle boards. The flea market was a great addition as I was able to pick up a few items from some of their locals. I've already made my reservations for throughout the summer.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

The good: nice shaded picnic area and store is good too.
The bad: restrooms could use cleaning and maintence
The ugly: boat ramp needs to be cleared of water weeds, so much your trailer will drag out a bunch.  Also, very tight area to maneuver your boat.  Last, good luck parking your truck and trailer.  Parking is very limited.< /review>

<text>A marina with dry dock and regular docks to store your boat as well as a launch ramp if you just want to put your boat in for the day. There's camping and RV spaces with full hook-ups including sewage, electric, and water for only $20 weekdays and $25 weekends. There's even a little general store with most anything you could need.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Tiki Lagun is one of the few resorts that is well maintained and seems to really care about customer service.  On top of that their prices on gas, food and supplies is very reasonable.  Waiting for a full service storage for my bass boat!</Review>

<text>The place is a joke, very dishonest people from my personal experience. Not even worth a star only other than to leave a comment to let other people know how the owner runs his business, Shawn the harbor master pretends to care about you then he reaches deep in your pockets, while sharpening his teeth. Not proper business ethics, this business even tried stealing my personal belongings while I was asleep. This place is super sketchy, and as fake as the people running it. Thanks for reading my post hopefully I can help someone else from making the mistake I did, BEWARE</text>< Pictures>

I have been a long time customer at Tiki Lagun and have always appreciated the friendly staff. But this weekend the staff went above and beyond, for which I am very grateful!

There have been countless times that I have stopped to assist a boater in distress, and a lot of times that I have towed a disabled boat back to the marina.  Good Karma, I always thought.

But when it was my turn to be broken down do you think anyone stopped to offer me assistance?  Noooo!

Without many other options we called Tiki, told them where we were and in very short order Mark shows up with the Tiki boat and tows me back!

Mark, Shawn, and Mandy, thank you SO MUCH!

Usually ok but this visit could have been much better. The office to pay for fuel is 75 yards and two staircases away from the dock and the clerk was less than helpful plus making mistakes that made this a half hour exercise.<//review>

<Review>This McDonald's was clean and had the newer interior. It has both a cash registers and  kiosks for orders.   it also has a small play space for children.

When I went there, there was a small line and the manager was quick to open up another register.  I had a sausage McMuffin egg meal and some hotcakes and sausage.  Same high-quality as always.<//Review><date>1558808842789< /date><user_name>Jhan Wilson</user_name>< user_id>

< Review>
This mcdonalds in ConCord is not very nice. I asked specifically for no cheese, no nothing on it, plain on my sons burger and fillet fish... and it came back with cheese anyway. My sons has autism so i cant let it go and ask for a new one. And then my order is missing fries too. I was not able to.go back for it because the person told me "line is so long, is that the only thing we need to change..." so i felt embarrassed and just hurry up to get out of their face... fish is soggy. Burger is dry and the bun seems microwaved. So no... im not coming back at this place!< /Review>

McDonald's is really good. We'll I mean obviously it's no like five star restaurant but for fast food. McDonald's get to much hate. Like come on. It's hot fast cheap and taste decent. Do you honestly care if it's healthy. McDonald's is the perfect fast food restaurant. McDonald's chains very rarely go out of business and the company as a whole won't go out of business until the second coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, if even then. I like McDonald's. Also I was going to add a picture of my meal before I ate any but I forgot and ate most of it.< /Text>

<Text>Look we all know McDonalds isn't good for you. Their food tastes alright. I like their fries and they're quick and straight to the point. If you're on a road trip or broke and hungry McDonald's is easy to get and they've cleaned up and refreshed their facilities so they are a much more welcoming environment and the staff is pleasant.<//Text>< pics>

As McDonald's go. .. This place rocks.   Clean, neat and modern.   This is not five stars compared with other sit down restaurants.   But compared with other McDonald's.  I used to camp out here to work sometimes.  Brighter and less crowded than coffee shops, and good Internet.  At&t.<//review>

<review>This is by far the worst McDonald's that I've ever visited. I went on a weekday morning about 550am. There was 2 cars ahead of me in the drive thru and the lobby was closed. They were having issues with the registers and it took 20min to get a simple breakfast that should've taken less than 5min. There was no apology given. Other incidents have been then simply messing up on the orders.</review><Resp>None<//Resp>< name>

I'm at the Drive Thru at 530am, they open at 5am, nobody responds. A man walks out to throw out some boxes out about 10 feet from me. He looks at me and I say "Hey, are you open?" And he just turns away and goes inside. Definitely need to change their hours of operation<//review>

My food was such a disappointment.  I specifically asked for FRESH FOOD. My filet o fish was dry and chewy, they put a quarter slice of cheese on it and said that's the amount they put on all the filet o fish and was going to charge me an extra 45 cents for a full slice. My big mac had SUPER THIN patties, were chewy as well and tasted like they poured the whole bottle of salt and pepper on them< /Text>

That's A dam lie. Google got this wrong... may have been near Mickey D's, but I do not partake in this manufactured good.

The USA Mickey D's is the only nation in which this restaurant does not buy their meat from the local butcher and instead manufactures it in a lab.

You're killing yourself and your children slowly, or quickly, by continuing to eat this mess.

Wishing your organs well.<//Text>

<Text>Food was good service was fast. Men's bathroom had a horrible stench to it not like some1 used it but just a fowl nasty smell that smacks you in the face when you open the door.

Update it has been remodeled. Looks great and smell is gone. Definitely recommend.
Morning manager (tall lady) very nice and makes sure your order is correct. One of my fav McDonald's.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I would give zero stars if I could. This McDonald's totally stole My Money! I used the new mobile order,  I drove to the McDonald's, went inside and they couldn't find the order. I showed them the receipt, they were able to pull it up. Then they told me I had to pay again. I showed them the receipt that was already paid, the manager said it didn't go through on there side, I needed to pay again. I showed her my bank account statement, with the deduction for their McDonald's for the amount of the order, and she still said she doesn't see it on her side, I have to call the bank. The bank is closed, she said I can't have my food unless I pay at the store. Ridiculous! I was charged for food, that you would not serve me.</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Review>This location just doesn't get it. You are supposed to give at least 1 packet of ketchup with fries, especially for to-go orders. Everytime you have to ask. It's as if the management has decided to save costs by not giving ketchup!!

Also, I don't think the advertised 'we cook it fresh when you order' is really being practised. I had ordered their signature recipe smokehouse bacon. The patty was clearly precooked and just microwaved when I ordered.

Made a mistake, next time I won't go here.<//Review><name>Sunit Katkar</name><Response>None</Response>< Rate>

The yelp reviews about this location tell it all...nice people at the front, but customer service, fulfillment of orders, follow-up, etc. is bad.  We ordered two Big Mac meals and asked for no pickles and extra sauce on both.  When we received our order, we were charged .49 cents for extra sauce, but the one burger that was marked extra sauce on the slip, had only a normal amount of sauce and the other was marked "no sauce" and had no sauce.   Why order something special if the order takers and/or preparers just ignore it?
We went back to the front and after being ignored repeatedly by the tall female server, the young man on the drive-up window came over and asked what we needed and got us some extra sauce.  Meanwhile the tall female server was just standing in the back chatting with her co-worker, after clearly seeing us standing at the counter waiting for some assistance.  The tables were dirty throughout the restaurant and the french fry timer was constantly beeping during our entire time in the restaurant (and I mean constantly!).  Not sure if the staff were just ignoring it or if only one of them was authorized to TURN IT OFF!  A really bad experience overall here.  Multiple staff standing around, doing nothing...<//text>

<Text>I've been coming here for two years now.  This is my favorite McDonald's in the area when I want to eat and relax.  The Staff here are all friendly and top-notch people!  The food here is always fresh and consistent, and the fries are never under or over-cooked and are seasoned just right.

There are other good McDonald's in this area, but I like the seating arrangement here the best.  Great Wi-Fi too!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Skip this location. Lots of errors and orders, always check before you leave. “Julia” helped me (after I pulled her away from a personal conversation). Wearing exercise leggings btw, aren’t you supposed to wear proper pants to work?!
No one else wears name tags so can’t name anyone else.

Drive thru is under construction and closed currently, just head down the street for proper service.< /Text>

Ordered one of the new largest Big Mac burgers and got more bread with the same size meat patty as the original. Didn't realize it until I ate half way through. The meat was lost in the big bun.< /Review>

< Review>
Absolutely horrific!  Do not expect hot food from the drive-through because everything is ice cold!  All very racist and very mean!

I honestly wish they never  relocated their old McDonald's. the food was always hot and good there.

Save your time and your money by not coming there Burger King is not that far down<//Review>

< Review>
We had placed an order through the app, and when we arrived the app told us to go to the counter. The cashier told us she didn't know what was going on and walked away. Then asked to talk to a manager, who then told us their app system was down and kind of rudely stated there was nothing she could do, period. Told us that we had to figure out how to cancel the order ourselves on the app, and wouldn't honor the discounts from the app. We ended up just leaving and going elsewhere.<//Review>

But when I got there at 12:46 AM, they were already closed and trying to explain to a drive thru customer ahead of me (who had placed a mobile order) that they couldn't make any of his food. Just a bad set of circumstances all around.< /review>< pictures>

<review>Terrible. I wish I could give a zero star rating. By far the worst experience we have ever had at a McDonald’s. I don’t expect much from McDonald’s but this was absolutely abismal. Order took forever, was wrong/incomplete. Ordered a drink and it was out so I asked the front and I got the most watered down Powerade I’ve ever had in my life. The only thing more disgusting was the bathrooms (another guest walked straight out after taking two steps in). The person in front took twenty to order because the WiFi was out and they couldn’t redeem a coupon. Go to Taco Bell next door.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Text>Worst McDonalds in the area...no napkins out for people nor sugar, catsup etc.  I think they think by not putting these things out they are saving sooo much money! These were the same who put a limit on one refill earlier this summer.  It is clean, and the staff is ok, but I hate asking for a napkin when I should be able to just get one.
Especially if you go there with kids.....

as a guest.They try to police the number of homeless people who steal free soda and other disrespectfull customers who mess up the tables because of one item was not communicated or miss understood and its done on purpose. service is great they make it an effort and purpose to do their best to meet the needs of the customers. including not limited to replacing the fries of a customer making large outrageous orders, paying with 100 doller bills and changing order after they been process and demanding a refund. the customer making their numbers go up. Sometimes guest and young kids vandalising their tables. They make it an effort to explain and try to make up for any machiene problem they have if its ice cream machiene failure or a credit card swipe machiene disfunction.

customer service is great. u cant come to mcdonalds and expect 5 star meal and the service is great. the only problem ive seen with it is low amount of diversity in staff from white employees and low amount of staff members who can fill up that gap<//text>

Came here to try the shamrock shake. I was excited because it looked so good. You take the firstbsip and it tastes like minty goodness. You you take the ones after that and you wonder where All the flavor went aside from the lack of minty, it's nice creamy and smooth.

Mcdonalds has nice modern and clean seating and there are real salt and pepper shakers on the tables!!

Service is good. Nice and fast employees. Overall, I like this particular mcdonalds.<//text>< pics>

< review>
Apple pies, and their variety of drinks, especially coffee, are my weakness when it comes to McDonald's specially when it comes to prices, I can have two pies and a large coffee for 2.18 in less than 2 minutes, can't get better than that!</review>
