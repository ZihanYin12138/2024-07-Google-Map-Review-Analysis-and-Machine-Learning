This is absolutely the best place to go if your in need of a good running car. I looked everywhere before coming here and wish I had never wasted my time looking because if I would have came here first I would have been in a car already. They do the job right the first time and they get you approved quick no matter what. The best place in all of the inland empire no doubt. Larry, Douglas, and angel were very respectful and had took the time to make sure we were 100% Satisfied with everything. I recommend everyone give this place a chance you won’t regret it.< /Text>

< review>
I was in the market and looking for a fully loaded 2013 or 2012 Chevy Avalanche LTZ. and I found a 2012 Chevy Avalanche at A&A Auto Sales.

I happen to come across A&A Auto Sales located in Fontana. I called them right away and talked to Ahmad. Ahmad mentioned that the car was still available.

I made an appointment to look at the truck on Sunday December 27, 2020 at 10am. I packed up the family and we were on our way.

As we approached the driveway of the dealership, Ahmad had the truck prepared and ready to go and parked at the entrance. it was a great welcoming onto the dealerships property.

We were greeted by a salesman, but I personally asked for Ahmad since we had already been communicated up to this point about the vehicle.

The family and I took the 2012 Chevy Avalanche out for a test drive and we feel  in love with it. It was love at first sight,  but I had to get to know it inside and out before I proposed to be in a newly committed relationship, LOL!

I thoroughly looked the truck over in detail. The exterior and interior was very solid. It had all the bells and whistles. Black on Black body paint and interior, just what I wanted.

I could go on and on!

As a consumer I was very impressed with their customer service and the pure humbleness of Ahmad. Ahmad and I got a chance to speak to each other for a while and it was determined, Ahmad is a good man and has a great heart and love for family.

The deal was solid and I appreciate the quality customer service!

Thank you again Ahmad and staff!!

I LOVE MY 2012 CHEVY AVALANCHE!!!!</review>

<review>My husband and I worked specifically with Gino. He was very honest and never sugar-coated the truth. We had a bad experience with another car dealership and was very cautious about the used car business over-all. This place restored our faith! We got the car we specifically wanted at a great deal! We are very happy with our purchase. The customer service we received from beginning to end was OUTSTANDING!!! I would definitely recommend A & A Auto Sales to my friends/family.< /review><date>1386226775669</date><name>Ultra Divine Empress</name><gmap_id>0x80c34b425714d0c7:0xfcf6e193c9c6bac0</gmap_id>< Pics>

Best place to get a car and get service. I bought a Suburban for my growing family and even though a service light went off they took care of it and I'm back on the road. I recommend A&A if you are looking for a car. The sales giybthat helped ke was Omar and he was very helpful and treated us right. Ask for Omar if you go.</Text>

Worst experience ever! I purchased a truck there, and at 1st of course they were friendly and nice to get me to buy the car! With in the 1st two weeks the truck began giving me problems, took it to the dealer where supposedly they replaced/fixed the truck. Well another two weeks went by and the truck gave out and the dealer would not fix or help with fixing it. I don't recommend you buying from here, I now have heard this place sells cars that do not work! I regret going here! I had to pay a whole lot of money to fix a new car just purchased, not good!</Review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>I'm from AZ and saw this particular Chevy Tahoe at A&A Auto through Cargurus that my family and I were looking for, since we are expecting another child and need the extra room. The color and year and price was perfect so I was very much interested with working with this dealership to purchase this truck. Since I would be heading to CA within the next few weeks to visit family, I figured let's try for the truck now. I dealt with a salesperson named Esmeralda. She gave me what I believe was her personal number and said that I could contact her regarding the truck. After being reassured that the dealership does do business with neighboring states, I was prompted to do the online application for the truck. We did the application and I let Esmeralda know through text that we completed and submitted the application. Esmeralda text back in a timely manner saying she would check the status and to give her a "sec." That sec lasted days. I had to continuously keep texting her about the status of our application and sometimes days between would go by until a response. I was given the same answer as all the other times, "sorry I got busy, give me a sec." I replied "okay" and waited to hear back from Esmeralda, but now a week has gone by without any sort of response or communication regarding the online application for the truck we were very much interested in. It would have been nice to be treated as a priority as we know all clients are treated with at an actual dealership. We were just as serious about purchasing this vehicle as any other person is who walks in a dealership looking for a vehicle and yet we were disregarded from the whole process. A phone call or text saying our application wasn't accepted or the truck was sold or whatever the reason was for not being contacted back would have been nice. My advice for anyone who is a neighboring state of CA and is trying to pursue a vehicle, don't go about it with this place through the phone or online. I promise you you will not be contacted back.< /Review>< pictures>

So we dealt with the GM he gave different #'s than what Gino gave, wanted to only give half of KBB trade-in price. The GM's attitude worsened when I advise I had my own financing through my credit union. Be ware of this place.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
Don't even waste your time.  I called mid morning on a Tuesday inquiring about a vehicle I saw on their website, asking if it was still available. Reyna put me on hold and went and checked. Said it was still available, and if I wanted to come see it, call them about 30 mins prior to my arrival to confirm and they will have it ready for me.   30 mins prior, I was about to leave work in Loma Linda, and called Reyna again to confirm that I was on my way. She confirmed with me the vehicle I was interested in, and told me she'd have it ready.  When I got there, I was informed that the vehicle I had inquired about had "just sold". So, this dealership is not only lazy, and unprofessional, but also full of liars. Wasted my time. Will never go back here.< /Review>

Great tracks, great staff. We went for a work event with a large group of 20 people, it was a lot of fun! They messed up our catering order initially but our sales manager - Raelyn was very nice and worked everything out for us. Great place for team or big group events.<//text>

This place was built in the 1950's & it looks like renovations haven't happened since the 70's. You will see plenty of broken fences, music boxes & closed off play spaces (Robinson Caruso's play area, the Japanese tea garden). I would give this place 3 stars, my son would give it a 5 so to round out our score it is a 4.< /text>

<review>A really cool place for Star Wars fans to see models and replicas of various props and costumes used in the movies. You can also "meet" some Star Wars characters and get pictures with them. They could flesh this out a little more, but it's a good holdover until Star Wars Land opens up.</review>< pics>

I can somewhat do the Chewbacca noise, so when I tried to do it, and choked, it was hilarious because then chewy tried teaching me how to do it better. Didn’t have to wait in line at all to meet him! This definitely made my day for being a Star Wars nerd</review>< pictures>

Star wars Launch Bay is an area for fans to see various displays and models strictly related to Star Wars. There is a merchandise area and plenty of art pieces to buy. Also inside this area are two character meet and greets and I believe the characters change. Definitely a nice place to walk through. (Path of the Jedi, is not inside this area, it is located next to space mountain)< /review>

<text>I have photos of my kids (now in their 40s) dressed as fairies, Indians, and maybe a gypsy or two. Playing about on the pirate ship at Fairyland. Holding hands with their grandmother in front of the Old Lady's shoe. No one in that simpler age thought fairies, indians, old ladies *or* gypsies were off-limits. ("PC" had yet to be invented.< /text>< Rating>

I would give zero star if I could.  We got the 8am to 11am reservation.  Even though this place has a few activities you could do, but I realized that you can only pick one thing to do and that's all since when you are done, all the other activities will be fully booked or ran out of supply.</review>

Loved meeting Chewie and Vader with my 7 year old nephew. Ok..as a huge Star Wars fan I was just as excited as he was!  Disney did a great job with this attraction. I just wish it was affordable for the average family to go to Disneyland just like the good old days when I was a kid.< /Review>

Fun little area if you want a bit more quite or to relax, there is a lot of cool star wars things to look at within here, and you can meet Darth Vader and Chubbacca and a few other characters within here.< /text>

My little brother and I thought it was a ride. It’s just a museum. You get to take a picture/interact with Darth Vader and Chewie, but lines build up fast. There’s also a short video you can watch behind the production of Star Wars. There’s also more info on the vehicles, armor, etc on display. The canvas drawings were really cool. There’s also lego star wars video games to play.</Review>

I love Star Wars Launch Bay. This area is inside with ac to cool off from the heat. Lots to see and do in here. They have the model of the new Star Wars Land that’s being built right now: Galaxy’s Edge. You can meet Chewy, Darth Vader, and many more Star Wars characters to meet. (They even have a special VIP one for those having a Star Wars credit card).  There are video games, legos, movies and many more things to do. There is a lot to do in here there are two levels!< /Text>

We went to take photos with Vader. We had a pose we wanted to do, and the photographer just stared at us without taking a photo. Then waited for us to do the lame standing and this is Vader pose. Was going to buy the max pass for the day just for this shot but nah, it was ruined. Hate your jobs another day, we pay to have fun.</review>

<review>I was the left main pilot and got motion sickness and stressed out during this ride. Then realized too that I had thrown my neck out on my right side. We got out of the ride though without crashing the plane and we only had 25% damage. It was not worth the wait.< /review>< gmap_id>

Preview center for the upcoming Star Wars Land combined with a gift shop and a display of the art of Star Wars!  it's a nice Retreat from the midday heat of Anaheim. Plenty of bench spaces and fully wheelchair accessible. There is a full-scale representation of what the new Star Wars land will look like that you can check out. They have a video presentation that talks about how they came to the design they did. This one is somewhat hidden. Make sure you get a look at it because it's well worth walking through!  #LetsGuide #10SecondsOf #Video</text>

< Review>
First of all, I must say, Star Wars Launch Bay is a complete disaster.  Nothing to do but meet two characters in 30 minute lines and look at very boring props (not used in the movies) and one gift shop. Worst thing that has happened to Disneyland (next to Star Wars Land).  Put the Carousel of Progress back in there.

Star Wars Land, believe me, will be a flash in the pan.  It will not be very successful.  Trust me.

Please don't listen to these people that promote this Launch Bay.  They are all part of the group thinking of Star Wars.< /Review>

<review>If you are a Star Wars fan then this spot is a must visit on your Disneyland trip. There's a ton of memorabilia to see, from scaled down models of different vehicles,  to life size costumes of some of your favorite characters.
They have meet and greets with Chewbaca, Darth Vader,  and Kylo Ren. On our visit there was a small wait time depending on who you wanted to see. Chewie had the longest wait, cuz who wouldn't want to see that giant furball.
There was a small interactive gaming area where you could play some Star Wars themed games like lego Star Wars or the Star Wars Angry Birds.
It was cool seeing the full sized costumes. For an easy $3000 you could take home a nice Darth Vader outfit complete with helmet and all. I personally liked the storm troopers.
So if you get a chance,  swing by while you are in Tomorrowland.</review>< Time>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Rating>4</Rating><Text>I wanted to give this place a 5 because of how dang happy it made me, but let me break it down for ya. I absolutely loved coming here. Not a shadow of a doubt in that. Seeing all these different set pieces from the films was great! There are divided areas for things. When I went on January 14th 2018, they had a musuem, a lego section, a shop, displays, a short film, and an area to meet scheduled characters. It was all so awesome! Now, you might be thinking, well if it was so awesome why did you give it a 4? I'd say because of the size! Starwars is such a huge deal to everyone, however the size of this museum is a TAD small.

TL;DR 》Despite all of this, I loved it. Perhaps one of my favorite places in Disney! If you like Starwars, I would recommend this. If you LOVE Starwars... well... WHY AREN'T YOU ALREADY THERE?!

(p.s I just found out about this "Starwars: Galaxy's Edge" theme park. I am so. so. excited.)

(Translated by Google) Models of starships, swords and characters.
Shop with clothes, swords and various gadgets all at absurd prices.

There is an area with tablet and console to play Lego Star Wars and files to do for a photo with some characters: at the moment there were Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, Rei and the legendary Chewbacca.

Cute but from Disney I was expecting something much more interactive.

Modelli di navi stellari, spade e personaggi.
Negozio con abiti, spade e gadget vari tutti a prezzi assurdi.

C'è un'area con tablet e console per giocare a Lego Star Wars e file da fare per una foto con alcuni personaggi: al momento c'erano Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, Rei e il mitico Chewbacca.

< review>
The place is closed for renovations right now. Will not reopen until February 16, 2016. Has been closed since January 1st. Address 4550 Atlantic Ave, Long Beach, CA. Service is slow and they do not have a lot of merchandise on hand. There is another Starbucks just down the road at San Antonio Drive and Atlantic Ave. This one does not work for rewards if you r fulfilling a challenge.< /review>

Review: Just purchased a table & the customer service was wonderful. Yelina was very helpful & knowledgeable. Went above & beyond for us & had absolutely ZERO issues answering our numerous questions. Cute & unique little place.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9ywYSTABhozXZ_78qeqHPz1Kwf0aEGKdDvVS3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0kYWjTwdXIUSTJe4tfY1LW9qXho4pcDwgPmFR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlMnESy_mTp65C9t2MKSxjC-MCBB33iDQMZVSh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTzdoKQ0OW6_9llZ1fPJCo7FaCMuYuQoZqsa3Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOT7jumbve8FzXPNwbgVWz5Y3J9yxuDe4AXBDtk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMy_m8HmPm88daEYDDc38No0Y4ecfaLQ632fP6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuoFN6NqwwgWsKQ8AKp_A3tE6vsUsjUFOAdRMC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgTwRYzD533jWsPy3bPGg5wQ0H-tte0_kj3SFi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><GmapID>0x809bdf871a2cfddd:0x66b54d97a6307703</GmapID></record>

<user_id>114841395420388081630< /user_id><text>They were awesome. They called back and found a cheaper way to do what we wanted and actually lowered the quote price. When they were done I couldn't believe how much it looked like new--better than new. A bland fireplace turned into a beautiful focal point. They cleaned and replaced everything and where before there was only two boring, flames, there is now a vista with embers and dancing fire. The light now works--didn't know it had a backlight. :-)

James and Gunner were a pleasure to work with and even after being told they couldn't do what we wanted, managed to figure out how to make it work. I will definitely do business with them again.</text><Time>1619646331449</Time>< gmapID>

We had Mountain Home Center install a wood burning insert just over a year ago and the professionalism outstanding! The quality of the install was great and we love our new insert. Fast forward a year and we decided to install a gas stove in the basement. Same experience. While the install was a bit difficult due to how we had to route the flue, they did an exceptional job and it looks fantastic! I have used a number of fireplace companies over the years mainly from Reno and found MHC is far superior in their ability and service. Thank you!<//text>

Great fireplace!
Devon was so patient and got us into the right unit for our new house.
James set it up, laying out all the logs and rocks beautifully. As well as going over the operation details thoroughly.
Highly recommend.</Text>

<review>Devon and Brittany helped me with a purchase of a firepit table (propane) and adirondack chairs. They were both very knowledgeable and worked hard to arrange having the items delivered to our home just days after purchase. Mountain Home Center has such beautiful products and I found it very helpful to see items in person and sit in various chairs in order to make the purchase that best met our needs.

We recently purchased a hot tub at Mountain Home Center.  The experience was top notch.  Exceptional service from Devon from the initial decision on what to purchase, the installation, plus over the top assistance when we ran into an issue shortly after first using the tub (our user error!).  I called Devon to get some advice and instead of advice, he stepped in the same day and helped us out himself!  We are very pleased with the hot tub itself and Sam did a fantastic job explaining the functions in detail. This is far more helpful than trying to read the manual.  The service experience alone will make me a return customer of MHC.</review>

We just had a very outdated gas fireplace that didn't work replaced by a new gas fireplace and we love it!!  Gunner always kept us updated with delivered parts and install appointments since we were in S. Lake Tahoe. His team were professional and got the job done. MHC also has a wonderful store where we have purchased some home decor!  :)< /text>

Julia recommended we check out the spas at Mountain Home Center, we were introduced to Devon he is very knowledgeable about the Hot Springs hot tubs.

After the purchase and setting up a delivery date, a nice group of young men delivered our hot tub. Colin, Damian, Oscar and Hakkan were very careful with the delivery and set up I would highly recommend this team.

To finish off the excellent customer service and experience Sam came out on a scheduled appointment to go through all of the maintenance, of owning a hot tub.

A pleasure to work with all the way around we are really enjoying our new hot tub!<//review></record>

Great place-we have been buying items from Mountain Home for over 13 years, BBQ’s, Pizza ovens, Patio Furniture, hot tubs etc. Great place and very friendly people. Most recently we had a leak on our hot tub-which was 13 years old. James came and evaluated the repairs-he was so helpful I sent him a bottle of whiskey as a thank you. We decided to get one of the new awesome Hot Springs tubs, and I talked with Tom Just about the features, and he was very informative.  Sam and team came to do the install, and it was flawless. Sam came back the next day and gave us a terrific in person guide on how everything worked on the tub. I cannot say enough about how nice these people are, how friendly, and what great service they provide. Mountain Home rocks!< /review>

Mountain Home Center has been serving us ever since moving to Truckee in 2008.  Everyone takes such good care of us.  We love their customer service!  MHC did not disappoint when they sent Paul out to repair our gas fireplace (purchased from them as well as our spa and Polywood furniture!).  Paul is very nice, professional, and extremely knowledgeable!  He was able to diagnosis and repair our unit timely and efficiently.  Paul also followed all Covid protocols and cleaned his entire work area as well as the fireplace inside and out.  We were definitely impressed!  Thank you Paul!

We wanted to create an outdoor living environment on our beautiful deck at our home in Schaffers Mill, Truckee.  We worked with Gunner to explore options for what we wanted and within an hour or so he had helped us select a love seat, coffee and end tables and two chairs.  Everything was delivered within 24 hours and set up, and we are now sitting out back enjoying a nice bottle of wine!  Thank you so much Gunner, you really made our shopping experience at the Mountain Home Center a pleasant one.  We will be back and would strongly recommend the store to everyone!< /Review>

We have purchased a number of items from Mountain Home Center over the years, including a gas BBQ Grill, deck furniture, umbrellas, and Adirondack chairs.  Everyone we have worked with over the years has been helpful and friendly.  When we compared prices online and in Reno last year, MHC's prices were competitive with everything else we saw. A bonus-the furniture was delivered for free and already assembled.  My husband and I believe in supporting local businesses, and it is easy to support the folks at Mountain Home Center...their customer service is wonderful and they have a beautiful selection of items in a variety of price points.  We will be returning to MHC as we look to upgrade our other outdoor furniture.<//Text>

We were impressed with Tom's and Sam's knowledge of their products.  They shared their 30+ years of experience well.  I will absolutely trust their advice and use their products in the future.<//text>

I brought my very picky grandmother in to pick out some home decor items for a vacation home she has in the area.  Since we had never been in the store before we didn't know what to expect, but were extremely happy with the level of service Carlie provided.  My grandmother can be difficult to deal with and Carlie showed so much patience, knowledge, and an engaging personality in helping her.   She ended up buying much more than she planned and is so happy with everything, which let me tell you rarely happens.  Thanks for everything and we will be back again.< /text>

<review>The team at Mountain Home Center have been fantastic to work with.  We have purchased several pieces of furniture over the past few years and recently  purchased a Hot Springs Spa.  In particular, we have worked with Price and Sam at the Mountain Home Center and they are excellent in working with their customers and supporting the purchase for delivery. Our spa experience required the coordination of the crane (for delivery to a back deck) and the electrician for wiring and starting the spa.  Sam was outstanding in coordinating the delivery on site at our home, and even better at walking us through the spa controls and details on how to best use and service our spa.  I could go on about both Price and Sam, but feel the entire team at the Mountain Home Center are outstanding and extremely service oriented. We had options on where to purchase mountain furniture and the spa, but would not go anywhere else for such purchases.  I suggest you ask for Price and/or Sam... you will not be disappointed!!!!< /review><Date>1561833855873<//Date></record>

5 STARS - Mountain Home Center exceeds all expectations when it comes to products and service. They go above and beyond what any other retailer can only dream of.  I specifically work with Scott Milliken who provides the best service you can imagine. If you want something, he'll get if for you...If it's out of stock, he'll find it for you & also get it to you. He'll do all this and then find you the most competitive, best prices available! Scott and Mountain Home Center treat their customers like they are family, which is so rare in this day in age. Working with them is truly a refreshing experience.<//Review>

I have been a happy returning customer of Mountain Home Center for well over 15 years and yet again they have come through for me.  Price Samuel and James Franck took such great care of my immediate need to replace my hot tub cover .  They showed up the very next day and installed and took my water logged old cover away (which lasted about 10 years, another great quality nod to them).  SUPER HAPPY and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!!!<//Text>

<Text>We recently had the best customer service experience at Mountain Home Center. While trying to get a wood stove door repaired in advance of guests arriving, store manager Sam Marsh stepped up and fixed it himself as his normal crew was away for training. Less than one hour later our door was good as new. Also a big help was Price Samuel checking us in and out. Highly recommend this store. What a great team.< /Text>< pics>

<review>Truckee/Tahoe's Awesome Home Experience: Do you need to replace your hot tub, wood burning stove, outdated backyard furniture or purchase a quality housewarming gift (and in this store, quality doesn't always mean expensive)? If so, check out Mountain Home Center. Interesting and diverse inventory combined with helpful, knowledgeable, friendly staff makes this a fun place to shop. Besides selling big ticket items, they also sell the products to maintain them (e.g., hot tub chemicals) or service them (e.g., cleaning fireplace flu). Support the local economy while also making yourself happy with your purchase.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1559159877137, 'text': 'It was great meeting you guys the other day, and Thank You for the kind words!

<rating>5<//rating><Review>We had our gas stove service by Colin and his team.   I left a voice mail and was contacted immediately by email to schedule an appointment within a few days.

They brought a new blower fan which we thought needed replacing.  The very professional technician identified that the noise was caused by a zip tie impeding the fan blades, saving us $200.  As part of the service call, they identified a gas leak in the burner which they then replaced a week later.  The second technician was equally as professional and now the stove is operating much more efficiently (and safely).

We were only charged for a single service call to address two different problems.  This was very reasonable.

Overall, I highly recommend their work based on their professionalism and honesty.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Coming from Houston, TX we were in need of some BBQ and outdoor utensils and items for a wedding.  The staff at the Mountain Home Center went well beyond the usual customer service to make certain we found everything we needed. While there my wife had discovered a few items that reminded her of her late father.  Linda was especially helpful in assisting me to purchase these items in secret and ship them back to TX.

We plan to return to Truckee for a vacation soon. We will be dropping in to the store to see what new items they may have. Thank you to ALL of the staff and especially Linda for all of the support and genuine hospitality.</text>

As a 30 year resident and practicing broker in North Lake Tahoe, I have become a huge fan of Tom and Alissa Just of Mountain Home Center.  I love introducing folks to their store.  The shopping experience is an event, tantamount to a kid in a candy store.  Their buyers have impeccable taste; with a huge selection of the most beautiful unique items…if you can’t find what you’re looking for there, you probably won’t find it anywhere.   However, until just recently I had never used their service department, and I honestly cannot find the words to express how pleased I was.  I needed my Fireplace Xtrordinair serviced.  Their technical knowledge is extraordinary, their technicians were immaculate, their thoroughness and attention to detail was remarkable, really they define the word service, and I cannot recommend them highly enough…Thank you Sam and your team!!!</review>

We're thrilled with our new Hot Spring spa from Mountain Home Center. Tom Just seems to have an encyclopedic knowledge of spas and helped us pick out just the right model for our family. Sam Marsh coordinated a seamless delivery and installation, and then went above and beyond teaching us how to operate the salt water system and maximize the filter life. I highly recommended Mountain Home Center for its excellent customer service and fair pricing -- and it feels good to support a family owned local business that always gives back to our community.< /review>

I originally purchased my spa through Mountain Home Center several years ago-- great price and seamless installation.

On several occasions I have either needed support or advice and always got what I needed quickly.

Sam is extremely knowledgeable about spa products and services and has never failed to either provide the necessary advice or educate me as to proper maintenance procedures

When I am next again in the Spa market I will be contacting Mountain M
Home Center. It is all about their service after the sale.< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>On Wednesday we came to our mountain home only to discover that one of our gas heaters had quit working. I called Mountain Home and scheduled a technician to come out Friday morning between 8 and 9am.

James showed up right on time, gathered his tools, introduced himself, and even removed his boots before coming in. He got right to work carefully dismantling the parts of the fireplace that he needed to in order to troubleshoot the problem. He had already laid a blanket on the floor to protect both the floor and the parts. He worked quickly and cleanly, replacing each tool in his box as used them. It was obvious watching him work that he knew exactly what he was doing, and that he was not surprised by, or puzzled by anything he was seeing. He was cordial, and courteous while pinpointing and then correcting our problem.

We had nothing but the best experience with Mountain Home, from Scheduling to completion of the work. A company can’t possibly do any better!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1549659697728, 'text': 'Thank you for the opportunity!

The employees of Mountain Home Center are the greatest.
We purchased a Lopi fee standing propane fire place for our donner summit condo in 2004.

We have had them service it every year to beside it is going to keep us cozy on COLD STORMET Nights.

They are the greatest,

<GmapID>0x809bdf871a2cfddd:0x66b54d97a6307703< /GmapID><review>Mountain Home Center is the Best! The friendly service we received from Rick and his crew when we bought a woodstove for our Tahoe cabin seven years ago has kept us coming back through the years.
From the Hotsprings spa (which we use every day!) to the Fireplace Extraordinaire they just installed in our new house, we couldn't be happier with the quality of the products they carry or their commitment to customer service and satisfaction. Sam has been a huge help to us as we've learned how to maintain our hot tub and troubleshoot minor problems that occur from time to time. Rick continues to be our fireplace guru and the "Toms" have been very helpful in finding the right product to suit our needs. We always know we'll hear back from someone in a timely manner when questions arise.
We will continue to consider Mountain Home Center our go-to place for purchasing major items for our home and recommend it highly to others. I should also mention that it's one of my favorite places to spend a little time because of all the fun decorator items on display.

We give a resounding two thumbs up for Mountain Home Center!</review><rate>5< /rate>< Time>

Homemade tortillas and delish but if going on your lunch, call order in , because everything is made fresh and to order with luv you need to plan your time. If you have time on lunch have a drink! The one with blueberries is refreshing!!<//text>

< review>
We had asada fries, a carne asada taco and a chicken taco plate. The fries were seasoned good. Too much cheese and not enough asada though. The asada taco was good, I like that they add beans to them. The chicken tacos were good too. They had a lot of toppings to choose from, like cilantro, cabbage, Chile etc. But the guacamole salsa had turned brown and that's what I was most looking forward to adding to my fries lol I would probably go again for the tacos but I'll stick to my usual place for the asada fries.<//review>

<Review>This is a great family owned local market that I enjoy shopping at. The meat market features fresh meat which the butchers are more than happy to prepare any way you prefer. The produce is also fresh, and they always have what I'm looking for. The owners are also the operators of the market and are so friendly that my family and myself consider them as family.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2d0b804f1b06b:0xa58fd13b24096617<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This fly has been frozen in La Chona cheese. This market should clean refrigerator storage up for releasing more space in order to artificially kept cool and store veggies and fruits.

Dec. 26, 2020, Red Baron Special Deluxe Pizza has passed expiration date [and the food] is spoiled. I am going to bring these receipt and bad food for a refund because this will cause the symptoms of food poisoning. The exp. Of this food was Dec. 31, 2020. This market should also sell Seirogan Herbal Dietary here as well. Dec. 27, 2020. There were Dollars seven for refund.<//review>

The BEST butcher shop in the San Gabriel Valley. Have been coming here for over 25 years. It is under new ownership and they sure have made the place alot cleaner and more accomodating. Lots of new product to offer.< /Review>

Amazing customer service, really friendly store owner.  Great butcher as well as enough dry goods and produce to make it my first choice for groceries.  Peck Market is my recommendation to locals since it has better quality meat and produce than some of the larger supermarkets, and spending money here supports small business.< /review>

So happy I went here, Cathryn is the best waxer I’ve had! I have very sensitive skin but she’s super gentle and quick. And Audrey gives the best tan - I always come out with an even glow without streaks. Again so happy with my service, the staff here are very kind and professional - thank you!♥️< /review>

I had last gone in to the Studio City location two months ago when they opened for a brief stint and then closed back down. So when I got the email about services being offered at the Santa Monica location in a cabana, I thought why not? So my friend and I decided to book our appointments, request the day off, and make a day of it! The cabanas are in parking lot but they are private enough and clean enough. The girls who did our services were fantastic and glad to be back at work. We will definitely be coming back here until our closer location opens up.< /text>< Rate>

The most important of all, the customer service is great. Cat is awesome!!! This was my very first wax experience of any kind and she made me feel so comfortable. She was quick which helps. She provided me with lots of information. She was conversational and kind. It didn't feel awkward at all. I felt very comfortable in her presence. Thank you Cat! You're the best!!!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Had my appointment canceled on me after waiting almost 2 hours after work for my appointment. Wasn't notified about the cancelation until I was checked in the second time, which took over 10 minutes of waiting at the front desk before anyone was available to help. Was told someone tried calling me to let me know about the cancelation but I have no calls on my phone to prove this. I had even called earlier to ask if any earlier apps were available, which they said no because they are committed to their appointment times. I completely understood this and I had willingly selected my app time. What I do not appreciate is being lied to and would have loved to have been informed before arriving that they would not be able to honor their app.
It took me being checked in a second time for this to be made known to me.<//Review>

The people here are so sweet. They talk me through everything before they do it and always make sure I’m 100% comfortable. They are very knowledgeable and well trained at what they do. They make sure I leave knowing how to follow up care. I love Sugared + Bronzed !!< /Text>

Great prices for the amount of care and service you get from the staff here! I tried the sugaring service and it was awesome! They made me feel comfortable and it was quick and easy. The best part is they are open until 11pm on the weeknights which is great for any last minute needs before a trip!< /Review>

<Text>I was just at this location for my last appointment and am happy to say that it is as clean and nice as the other locations I have been to (NYC & South Bay). I was running late, and called them to let them know, but they reassured me that I would keep my appointment as long as I wasn't delayed past a certain time. Parking was easy to find, since they have a small lot behind the building. When I arrived, the girls at the front desk were really nice and welcoming (I don't recall any names, sorry!). Even though I arrived a few minutes late, the girl who handled my appointment was thorough and quick. Thanks again for another awesome experience for something we all dread doing!</Text>< Pics>

Went in for my first sugaring yesterday and it was definitely a positive first experience! Katie kindly explained everything to me, and calmed my nerves. However, some of the info she shared with me differed from what I was told when I called the studio; I would've been more prepared if the info I was told beforehand was consistent with what Katie said. Overall, great experience and I will be returning now that I know the process!< /review>

<Review>Absolutely the best spray tan hands down! They do it manually so the tan comes out very even, looking natural and fresh(they only use natural ingredients)! The ladies who work there are amazing so sweet and helpful. It was my first time trying them, was very impressed with customer service and the quality of the spray tan that I got!<//Review>< user_id>

I've gone to this place a few times now. Very cute space with good ambiance (liked the fun music they were playing too). The staff was very friendly, attentive, and I appreciated that they were running on time. I'm new to sugaring, but it's quick, feels less painful than waxing, and best of all caused no skin irritation. I'd highly recommend this place and will be coming back for future services!< /review>

I can’t recommend this place highly enough! I have never done sugaring before and after my first time experience at s&b, I’ll never look back. The team is friendly and professional and fast and efficient. I love the technique and the fact that it’s good on the skin. Beats waxing any day! You must try it!<//review>

Got a spray tan here yesterday again for a wedding I have coming up this weekend. I was a few minutes late, and felt terrible, but the staff was so kind and accommodated me regardless. This place is literally the best spray tan you are going to get! Completely even, flawless, and the staff is so sweet. I will continue coming back when I need a glow for an occasion, or just want that extra bounce in my step to feel confident! Thanks again, Sugared + Bronzed!<//review>

<Text>I absolutely LOVE this place. The girl was so sweet which made it much easier to take all of my clothes off and stand in front of a complete stranger. When I walked in, I immediately noticed how clean the salon was. The staff was welcoming and answered any and all questions that I had. The girl who did my tan was very good at walking me through the process and consulting me on what color would be best for me. In the rooms, they provide disposable underwear, hair ties and bobby pins if need be. The location makes for a easy-going and relaxed atmosphere on Montana Ave in Santa Monica. When I went, I got my tan and then walked a couple of blocks and got a cup of tea and a cafe. When tan started to really appear a few hours later, everything was even and natural-looking. I was very impressed. All in all, my experience was great! 4 stars all the way.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c2bb4543f44421:0x258ac85c313e17f3<//GmapID></record>

This is the only place I will go in Santa Monica for tans-- they are super clean, the spray doesn't smell so toxic-- I can actually breathe while I am getting sprayed.   The color is amazing, so bronze and awesome, and doesn't smell afterward.  Lasts for 7-10 days without splotching.  The staff is super friendly.  I love it here!< /review>

I absolutely love this tanning salon! This is the only one I ever go to and I completely trust Bronze Santa Monica. They were also my first tanning experience and they made that completely comfortable. My first time was the whole awkward should I be naked? Not naked? Am I fat? lol It was painless and they made me super comfortable throughout the process. Their prices are perfect and a great deal. They also don't streak which is so difficult to find! I love this place. If you have somewhere to go and need a nice tan? Trust THEM. They will not leave you orange, streaked, discolored, etc. For every special event that I go to and need a nice warm glow, I come here! Great place, you won't regret it!</Text>

So happy to have found Sugared & Bronzed Santa Monica.  Can't beat the Express Spray Tan...less than 4 hours.  Megan has done a wonderful and consistent great job...never any streaks.

Clean and everyone there is helpful and friendly.

Only complaint...I wish they wouldn't charge for disposable shower caps...wouldn't want to get a spray without a cap.  Any other disposable product charges I understand!

Otherwise....great and highly recommended!</text>

I have been going to Bronzed for about a year and a half now and have consistently had the best results. I can safely say that I've tried over a dozen different airbrush salons around LA and Bronzed airbrush tans are the most natural, long-lasting tans -- I can really tell a difference when I go to other salons whose solutions do not last as long. All of the Bronzed staff are very helpful and professional. There is a small parking lot behind the Santa Monica location that fills up quickly, but I have never had trouble finding parking on the street. Five stars.<//review>

I love this place! Staff is pleasant and accomodating. Very easy and convenient to book appointments online. My tan was streak free and lasted almost an entire week. I've had experiences in the past where the solution is too dark and then washes off completely after 4 days. The tan lasted and looked very natural. I was quite pleased and will be sure to return to Bronzed for my next spray tan.< /Text>

Bronzed is hands down the best place for airbrush tanning. It is easy and convenient to make appointments online. Their staff is very professional and the color is so natural! I won't go anywhere else. For your first session they offer you two airbrush tans for the price of one - great deal. I highly recommend this place. I have only been to the Santa Monica location, but I imagine all their locations are just as great as this one.< /review>

Bronzed is always my first pick for a spray tan.  They have flexible appointment times, you can book online, and once you get there the staff makes things quick, efficient, and as comfortable as possible.  I usually go with the express service so that I can shower in 2 hours and not stress on drying times.  I have used them for the past 4+ years and because there always have great results—tans last up to a week, no streaking or weird orange colors.  Lots of love to the great team there!<//review>

<Review>If you're trying to get a little glow without the sunburn, this is definitely the place for it. The staff is friendly, knowledgable and great at making you comfortable. You'll need to be completely nude for this, so it's important to trust the ladies who are helping you out!

Pro Tips:
- Exfoliate 1-2 days before so any dry skin is scrubbed off in advance
- Don't make any big plans for a few hours after this, because your skin will feel a bit strange and clammy until you can shower
- Don't get anywhere near water until the technician says you can! I tried to wash our dog (idiotic) and a few splashes got on my leg (like a fool) so I had some tiny streaks.
- Wear loose fitting clothes for after the session</Review>< GmapID>

I've been to many spray tan salons in Los Angeles and i have to say this is my favorite. They are always on time, the tan lasts long and looks so natural. The staff is very nice and helpful. Easy location and parking, I wouldn't go anywhere else. Thanks Bronzed :)</Review>

I had my first sugaring experience at Sugared + Bronzed and it was such a pleasant experience. The girls are always friendly, welcoming and are always very professional when it comes to the treatment. Definitely would recommend switching to sugaring from waxing!</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Bronzed is my go to spray tan place and I recommend it to all of my friends and family.  I sometimes feel like I am a walking advertisement because I am constantly telling people who want to be tanner - Go to Bronzed!  They do a fabulous job every time, I am always evenly tanned all over and the girls make me feel super comfortable.  They have never been late and are so accommodating.  I also love the way that you can just text them and tell them when you would like a tan and they will get back to you super fast so you aren't waiting to see if they can fit you in.  Bronzed is a great place and I am super satisfied every time I go- can't wait until Halloween is almost here so I can go again!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

The tans last forever, are great quality, and the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating - and you will always end up with a flawless tan. The express tan is great if you have an event that night - just rinse off after 2-4 hours (depending on your desired level of tan) and you're ready to go. Truly the best place for airbrush tans.

Wow, I have to say I have been to a lot of places for air brush tanning. I have never been so happy with the way it turns out and the way it fades away naturally. Not one time, but every time. I'm extremely fair skinned and the color is just perfect. People never can believe that it's air brush. Bronzed is absolutely amazing!<//Review>

<text>LOVED my experience at Sugared + Bronzed. I have super coarse hair and it as my first time getting sugared, but the ladies were so gentle and reassuring. I did the complimentary session with a trainee and everything went smoothly.

I'll be back in 4 weeks for a touch-up - I'm officially converted to sugaring!</text><pics>None</pics><GmapID>0x80c2bb4543f44421:0x258ac85c313e17f3</GmapID></record>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>I really like this place. I've been twice so far. The only reason I have 4 stars on here instead of 5 is because I did the express tan instead of the tan where you need to wait 6 hours to shower. The first time I actually slept in the tan because I got the spray at night, I think it lasted a lot longer than that. When I got the express tan it definitely faded faster, and my feet were a lot paler than my body. Even though the woman was so nice I cannot say a bad thing! This is definitely my go to spray place.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb4543f44421:0x258ac85c313e17f3< /Gmap_id></record>

I trust the awesome team at Bronzed to give me a natural Mediterranean glow each time.  I've booked them before photo shoots and red carpet events without having to worry about turning too dark.  Also, as a holistic health coach, I especially appreciate the #organic non-toxic formula they use.

I prefer the Express Tan because you can shower in about 2 hours after the treatment.  #BronzeBabe #Grateful< /review>

I love this studio.  The girls are very friendly, the place is extremely clean and they are always prompt. I normally get the "express" tan in Medium/Dark which looks very natural on my light olive complexion. I would highly recommend this studio to anybody looking for a natural even spray tan.</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I'm not a huge tanning person per se (white, burn, peel freckle) but will do airbrush tan for certain occasions.  Have had very bad results elsewhere in the past but always good results here.

There's some street parking with meters (do not let your meter expire!) some neighborhood 2 hour parking free and a small lot behind Montana Ave side of building.  Skilled, helpful staff.  Good color. Easy service for when you need/want some color.

They were very patient with me, a nervous client, too!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Love that the sugaring process is all natural. It does get a little sticky down there, just ask for an extra wipe with witch hazel. My hairs have gotten thinner and with exfoliation I haven't got as many ingrown hairs as I have with waxing.<//Review>

There's a reason why all of the S+B locations have glowing ratings and reviews! I live in SF but I always try to book an appointment here when I'm in LA. Very reasonable prices and super friendly and efficient!< /text>

I was super freaked out by the whole streaking fake orange look and dismissed spray tanning. I had to do it for a photo shoot and happened onto this place. Omg. I wish I could look and feel as good as I do after each visit at this place. The saddest thing is when it gradually fades and it still looks good when it does no harsh lines. I force my husband to go too. He looks so much more amazing with a sun-kissed hue. He knows it too.</review>< Date>

Today I had the pleasure of meeting the owners Sam and Courtney. They were so down to earth and totally appreciated my business. Their staff is awesome. I always have the perfect "Sunkissed" look. I highly recommend their Bronzed Tan Extender lotion, it is amazing. I can guarantee you too will have the same experience I do every time I go for their service. Happy Tanning.

I've had great experiences at Bronzed, each time I airbrush tan with them.  The color is great and staff is very helpful.<//Text>

I've written a review on Yelp as well.  I've never had a problem with going here.  The girls are always nice, sweet and cute.

My spray tans have lasted as long as two weeks!  I've never had a problem with blotchiness or discoloration.

I like that there is a 'back way' to get to the salon and it's on the second level.

I usually go at night and have never had to wait.  I don't mind waiting anyway as I try to get there early, I expect to wait.

There is one girl there , a blonde (wish I could remember her name) , curvy who is super cool.  She talks to you a lot, especially if its a cold night and I'm freezing through the spraying process.  She takes my mind off it.

Lately, I've had a thinner blonde who gets the job done, but she's the least chatty tanning tech I've met there.  I feel colder somehow when they don't talk too much.  But I don't think that deserves a star off.

I've been going here for over 3 years.<//text>

<review>Great place with good people and awesome vibe. It's like being with friends and a fun place to get a drink and chill.

<Review>I walked by this place many a time & said to myself "I'm really wanna check this place out."  Didn't get served mid day however went back at night and it's a cool spot. Nice outdoor patio, cozy inside, haven't tried the food yet but the menu looks awesome. If you are a burger fan this looks like the spot! Get back to you as news breaks😋<//Review>< Pictures>

One of my favorites! Only reason it gets 4 is I am hoping I won't have to wait to be seated and I like music playing instead of the tube. Cafe within convenient store. Good food, with great beer selection on tap. The staff is amazing, actually some of the most down to earth people you will meet. Screw it, they deserve five.</Text>

<text>At $9-$10 a sandwich this place is awesome! I always get the Woodstock which is their veggie sandwich......so delicious. They cut and grill up squash and zucchini among other veggies and then pop your sandwich into the oven for a bit. Handmade everytime and so so good!! They are open quite late and have a little beer garden as well. I always phone in my sandwich orders because they do take about 10-15 minutes to make.< /text><Date>1476906675076<//Date></record></dataset><record>

Just had lunch from here with my wife, the sandwiches were both delicious, I had the pulled pork sandwich and the peppers were an interesting and satisfying combination. The Jive Turkey sandwich though, which my wife shared a bite of, was exceptional. A wonderfully stacked sandwich that had an excellent combination of flavors.

We also had the orzo and thai peanut deli salads, my wife enjoyed her orzo but I did not enjoy the thai salad. The dressing didn't capture either peanut sauce or the typical thai cucumber salad dressing I was expecting. I was disappointed but we both enjoyed our sandwiches so much that they've still earned five stars for speed, flavor and value.

We will definitely be back to try more offerings from this little gem.</Text>

My car had some work being done at a near by tire shop. I went walking around and found a small park with a few pokestops. This place was nice, clean, and decorated for Christmas. I had a good stroll and found other small landmarks near by.< /text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>This is a great museum that shows the history of our town and California. I could spend all day here going through documents and looking at all of the collections.  It is free to enter and always takes donations if you are willing.  The holidays are amazing with all of the decorations that are put up.  It is definitely worth a stop if you are a history buff.< /Text>< pictures>

There's an entire room filled with old newspapers and photos. You'll find many other rooms authentically decorated with furnishings from past decades. You can also see the original courtroom just as it used to be. During the holidays, the museum is beautifully decorated and each room dons its own themed Christmas tree. Its definitely worth going.<//Text><time>1448448417476</time><response>None<//response><pics>None</pics>< rating>

The museum is an old County courthouse and looks very interesting from the outside. Unfortunately it was closed on the day I went , Google had the wrong hours of operation they are only open on the weekends at the moment.
Be careful this may not be a safe neighborhood I saw two large guys in their twenties bully a young lady off of the sidewalk.< /text>

Fairly small dog park, and very well shaded. There are a couple agility courses, which is nice. There's no water, since the fountain doesn't work 😔</Review>

< review>
It's been nearly 5 years since William Robert Belcher passed away.  He truly was a visionary of the Parks in Fresno.
"Bob" as we was lovingly called by anyone who knew him over his 4 decade span at the city parks department was a Great Person.  Beginning in the early 50's before Fresno even had 100k residents.

'Trees and grass come and go, but green space and people who love it are eternal.'

RIP Bob and Thank You for being You!<//review>

<review>Small park but full of charm. The dog play area was small but outfitted well. Playground was clean and well maintained. Parking was easy and ample for size of park. All facilities were well maintain. Park is pet and family freindly.

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>I come here for the dog park. Respectful owners, adequately trained dogs. The park states to leash your dog, however, I see others unleashing their dogs all the time. With that said, come with caution. If your dog isn't well trained, enough to listen to you when you say stop or come, please leash your animal. I only unleash my dog when the dog park is completely empty.</Text>< Pictures>

A very nice Community Park. Well kept, has a play ground, a dog run and is family friendly. A well-shaded park for a warm summer afternoon or evening. This Park is open until 10 pm.</Text>

<Review>The park recently added a dog park area off to the side. Great addition and heavily used quickly. Earlier in Oct 2018, they closed the park and started to add agility items for the dogs. Once opened this will be great. Thanks Fresno.

Update: the dog park is open. Dogs are actually learning agility items. Many dogs are using and owners are being responsible - good place to take fido.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I like how this place is in a hidden location and has a big gazebo that provides good amount of shade. However, the structure is built more for children who are kindergarten and up. Not a great place for Preschoolers.</Review>

The  park is small but very nice. The equipment is new and there are lots of mature trees for shade over the grass. It's in a nice part of town, and the picnic benches are covered and cool.<//review>

Didn't know Thrifty went down the drain like this, 3 hours wait, while they 'clean' the car, then you get the shabbiest possible, scratched all over fiesta with Florida plates, really?

They rudely offer you instead a Mercedes for 50$ a day , incredible. Would maybe be okay for one day but definitely don't want to spend extra 400$ for a week. Thrifty used to be okay, budget but very solid no frills cars, what on earth happened with them. Never again<//Review>< Pics>

Check in was easy and very professional! Check out was even easier! The car did not smell like smoke and was very clean. I'm sorry if other people had problems but all I know is this was the best experience I have ever had in renting a car!!!!!<//Review>

Then no matter how long you’ve been waiting, if someone enters the express lane they attend those customers first. So they won’t take a regular customer until the express lane is empty. I understand they paid and those are rules, but this company should respect the time of ALL its customers. Hire more help.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>1 star is way too generous for this sh1t show. Booked 6 weeks in advance and walk up to countless people waiting hours for their cars that AREN'T HERE. Looking through the reviews I now realize this is a common practice with Thrifty. I'll absolutely never use this company again. After flying for 10 hours with my 74 year old mother I'm now waiting hours for a car that a reserved 6 weeks ago. And I have no idea when it will be available. With 6 of us traveling we have no other options. What are the offering as compensation you ask? A tank. Of. Gas. This place shouldn't be allowed to exist. Absolutely robbery. Avoid at all costs.</Text>< pics>

Good rental for the money. Only reason for 4 stars, is because the car was dusty inside. Other then that, good customer service, nobody is trying to upsell on anything extra, like insurance, gas refill, etc... good cars, but for the most part base models. Basically, you get what you paid for. Will use again.</text>

I waited 1hr for a care even if I had a reservation for it. It was the only rental service that had a line. Although the agent was kind and patient, the company itself need some work if they want a loyalty base.< /review>

Absolute waste of time. Even with a confirmed rental, it was a 2 hour wait because there were no cars available. Apparently this is a normal occurrence.

As other reviews mention 1 star is way too generous for this location.<//Review>

What a scam! I paid $171 for a mini-van, which we needed because my wife and I have 5 kids. Got to the counter and got denied because I was paying with a debit card! Had the supervisor come out and he told me they can give me a full size car but that was all! They were going to leave us stranded in San Francisco with 5 kids!!! Walked over to Alamo and was sitting in a mini van within 5 minutes! That’s how it should be! Then we get a refund from thrifty of $71, umm, where is the rest of our money! Taking advantage of us and having nasty customer service is not what I expected, but we will no longer be dealing with thrifty! They are dirt bags!< /text>

<text>We had reserved a car at the O'Farrell St. location and when we arrived the only car in the class we had booked was very badly dented and reeked of smoke.  They gave us another car but insisted on charging more.  The Thrifty customer service number was supremely unhelpful so we decided to drive to the airport to see if there was any way to get an undamaged car in the class we booked.  Despite being very busy (there was a line out the door) the manager there personally came out and helped us, apologized for the issue, and swapped out the car free of charge.  Wish I could remember his name, this was on the afternoon of 4/1. Very impressed with management at this location!</text><gmapID>0x808f782b5d839c71:0x79a3c88a391738d1< /gmapID>< rate>

After booking and paying for the car online, I was surprised with a $600 deposit due at the counter. They would not use my company credit card, and they would not let my company pay for it over the phone. The staff is extremely rude, they don't even try to help their customers, mainly because they are low wage workers with no power to actually do anything. The lines are extremely long, very long wait times, I was over 2 hours late for work. I got to the counter at 7:30 and didn't get my car till 9:45. This place should be ashamed of themselves, the business is very immoral and corrupt. Avoid this company and their partners which are THRIFTY, DOLLAR, & HERTZ. Avoid at all costs.< /Text>

Horrible experience
When we arrived to the airport , I waited for about 40 mins on the line to get to their staffs. Afterwards, their staffs asked me to pay an upgrade,   otherwise,  I needed to wait  another 30 mins for my reserved car.  I rejected the upgrade but added an insurance on my car rental. After a while, I  believed they rented out the car I have reserved, therefore I got a free upgrade. I reserved my car over hotel.com with my chase sapphire credit card. And I used this card on my whole trip without any problem. However , Thrifty, for some reasons, didn't accept my card. Their staff asked me to use other credit card and told me I wouldn't get double charge.  Finally I went to parking lot to get my car. The 1st car looked dirty and it was malfunction.  I went to their store again, they redirected me to another parking lot space to get my car. The 2nd car wasn't there, so that I had to go back to their store again.  The 3rd car, they gave me was a 2 door car while I  reserved a 4 door car. So I went back to the store again. I spent another hour just went back and forth to the airport and parking lot to get my car. Few days after my trip, I found out they charge to twice on both credit card. I called back and asked. Thrifty told me that was my upgrade charge and rejected to pay me back.  I would never use this company again. AVOID using this company.<//Review>

<user>110857780872662097631< /user><review>I made the reservation weeks in advance to pick up at 5pm. I had to wait over an hour to get a car. Explained to the i had a reservation for dinner that i had to cancel, no discount or any complimentary service was offered. I walked the entire garage looking for the car that it happened to be there. After 30 min looking for the car i was told is not on the 2nd floor where the cara are to pick up, but on the first floor. Not recommend at all, they could have save it with a good costumer service, but they lack that as well</review><rate>1<//rate>< GmapID>

<text>I have rented many cars from Thrifty. I am a loyal customer. If you see this today, please contact me, as I need to pick up my car from yesterday. The desk was closed at 10pm. I had a car reserved for 10pm, and there is always a 1hr or so grace period to pick up your car. I arrived shortly after 10pm to the counter closed. I cannot afford the walk up prices of the other companies, so i always book in advance. I have tried calling Thrifty and they will not match the price I had from yesterday, then gave me a false number to contact your desk directly. I have now wasted an entire day of errands I had to get done, and wasted money having to take a uber to where I needed to be last night. I still need a car, but prices are too high all over the place now. I would like to pick up a car today at the same rate I reserved. I cannot afford to take an uber back to your counter just to be rejected again! People are trying to make a living and you are screwing them over.< /text>< Pics>

Worst customer service I’ve ever had...... I am not a troll.
San Francisco airport thrifty / dollar rental car charge me for a car, I never received.

Do yourself a favor not rent from here.

I landed on time in SF.
I had pre paid for the rental before I came to town.
Once there I sat on line for the car for one hour & thirty minutes.
Then after I finally got to the counter
lol I was told they had no cars available for at least an hour.

I asked to cancel the order and I was told since there weren’t any cars The contract was void.

This was a blatant lie!
Not only was I billed immediately but  I have tried to get my money back multiple times only to be told I pre-paid.

Do yourself a favor please stay away<//review>

<review>I rented a vehicle on the 29th of July for 2 days. Chrysler 300 with less than 900 miles. The lady at customer service was awesome, gave me a rundown of the rental agreement and soon I was on my way. The experience was great. Soon after returning the vehicle I received the Statement of Charges and there was a $400 Other (damage) fee. I completed the survey and received an emailed response from Tom Trice (Location Manager) in reference to the fee. He explained that there was smoking in the vehicle. I responded that that should not have been the case because I do not smoke. He was supposed to give me a call on Aug 1 between 2-3pm but failed to do so. I previously rented a vehicle with Alamo that smelled like smoke and reported it before leaving the lot. This is very unacceptable and unfair because I failed to receive a callback or even evidence of smoking in vehicle. I will not speak down on this company because there are great people who work for it and need a job during this pandemic, but Mr. Trice I am very disappointed in my experience and the fact that you failed to keep your word.<//review><Gmap_id>0x808f782b5d839c71:0x79a3c88a391738d1</Gmap_id>< name>

I rented a car over a month ago and when I arrive to the line there is a line of about 20 people ahead of with only 2 employees working at the time. When we have waited for over 30 minutes one of the person in front of us informs that there are no cars available. We aren’t offered a refund and we are told to wait two hours to see if there will be a car available. In addition to the that the clerk was not helpful and rude.</Text>

They scammed me and threw on an extra insurance that I didn’t agree to.  They also ran my card twice for $475.  I called a million times and they told me they couldn’t help me.  If you meet an Middle Eastern Man at San Francisco Airport with a picture of himself on his shirt, stay far away.  Worst Service Ever.<//Review>

<review>Faramaz is a sleazy salesman he straight up LIE to our face saying that it will be cheaper for them to refuel the car so I took his word and did not fill it up. After I return the car I was charge with 3x times more than normal price and on Top of that he added LOSS damage waver and Insurance on to our rental agreement with out our consent. I rented with Thrifty in LAX 3day prior to this and sales rep ask us if we need insurance and I decline because I have my own but Faramaz did not even asked us and added the insurance with out our consent and after I return the car I found about it and went back to same location right before my flight and I explain to him he did not ask us and HE REFUSED to accept his mistake and blame everything on us because I sign the paper. HE DID NOT MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT IT ADDING THE CHARGES. WORST SALESMAN ever I dealt with HE STRAIGHT UP LIE TO OUR FACE.< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
Staff were super nice and helpful. Whoever’s in charge of staffing this location at corporate, not so much.

I’m standing in line right now actually, which gives me plenty of time to leave this review. Of the 8 or so other car rental companies whose counters I can see right now, the most people waiting in line is 3. Thrifty currently has 57. All of us are peacefully chilling in line, packed closely together during a pandemic So we don’t lose our place in this orderly line.

Whoever runs this rental car building has done a pretty good job with ventilation, though. So that’s been nice to enjoy.

Other observations:

It’s kind of amazing everyone who has been waiting with me for around 45 minutes so far is still in pretty good spirits.

The Thrifty logo could use a refresh, IMO.

Dollar’s is pretty good.

It was confusing which line to wait in, until we learned Dollar and Thrifty have the same line. Does that mean they are the same company? Possibly. UPDATE: Just learned they are—and that they are together owned by HERTZ! Shocker of the last hour for me. This leaves me with a question: Why doesn’t the Hertz counter over there help us out? No one in line there. That hertz.</Review>

Told the guy I didn’t need insurance, he said no problem just need to authorize a few hundred.

Well turns out he did add insurance and straight up lied about it. Put the contract in my briefcase so of course didn’t notice until I return the car.

Absolutely sleazy tactics.</Text>< Resp>

<name>Tony Simmons< /name><Date>1599290033691<//Date><Rating>1</Rating><Review>After renting a car, our plans changed and we attempted to cancel. Employees on the phone transfered us back and forth to different departments, before finally, after 3 hours, telling us they could not cancel without supervisor approval. But, oh, there is no supervisor available. So we could not cancel, because someone could not come to the phone. We left a number with the attendant and were told someone would call us back, they never did. When we arrive at SFO, to find an endless line of at least 200 people, with only two employees working behind the counter. Customers were forced to wait hours at the airport to get their car.  We had to wait into the night to get a car we did not want. After waiting over an hour, they had us change lines to a different car company, to then tell us the issues were because they overbooked and did not have any more cars. When we asked again to cancel, they said no.

Recap: we tried to cancel, they refused to address us, we wait in line for almost two hours, they tell us they actually don't have a car for us, so we ask again to cancel - and they again say no. We left with no car, and Thrifty kept our money.

This was the worst car renting experience I've ever had and will never rent from Thrifty again. I'd advise you do the same.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>Booked a fullsize car and the person at desk refused to give me a car as my licence says ‘probationary’. I said it is  New Jersey policy to have it on licence for first 3years and same time people beside Thrifty like Avis and Alamo accepted to rent me a car. But the person didn’t listen to me and I ended up paying a lot to get car from Alamo as I’m booking at last min.

Very un professional and it did upset me on the first day of my trip< /text>< GmapID>

Make sure when you rent with this car rental you have time to waste as they will make you wait over an hour even if you have a reservation made, because they have no cars and no customer service. After the half an hour they told me to wait they kept telling to wait and to wait. If you value your time rent somewhere else.</review>

The worst car rental I've ever experienced.

We rented a car on Nov 17. After less than an hour of the car being released, the car battery slowly died down (no, the headlights weren't on) and luckily we were able to park in a safe place (450 Rhode Island, SF. Less than 10 miles from the airport) along the way before it shut off completely. We called customer service numerous times and had a delay of 5 hours out of our personal plans, thus, we decided to return the car to the nearest thrifty rental branch. The towing assistance was provided but it took them 2.5 hours(!) to get to us despite the fact that it took us 15 minutes to get to the closest thrifty brunch (Mason street) when finally the car was checked and started by towing service. It was such a huge inconvenience and disappointment as we were hoping to have a great Sunday but unfortunately not able to due to this mishap.

After that in a week I had to call the bank and request my money because thrifty support didn't want to do anything with it!

And then, finally, on Dec 6 (which is 21 day from the incident) I got a message from them:
"All vehicles should be properly cleaned, serviced, and in good mechanical condition before being released for rental.  The condition of the vehicle you received is a concern to us, and we apologize for the inconvenience you experienced.  We always want to provide quality vehicles to our customers and certainly appreciate your letting us know of your experience.  This matter will be reviewed with our maintenance personnel. "

Sounds like "dear client, we don't care about your wasted plans, time and money", right?

When I asked for a compensation (the same class car, fully paid for one day) they simply ignored me.

Please, never use thrifty. It's a bunch of frauds that has zero responsibility for their "service".</Text>

I rented a minivan from thrifty at SFO for a drive cross country. Desk staff was so helpful and attentive. Young Asian-American gentleman at the front knows customer service and is very professional...he will run something big one day.

Return of minivan at RDU (NC) was easy peasy. Have used thrifty often now and am a HUGE fan. Thank you for a quality renting experience. ✌🏽💗🙏🏽</Text>

I booked a mid-sized SUV on the Southwest app. When I got to the counter the clerk tried to get us to upgrade to a four wheel drive for $32 a day more. We declined. She then gave us keys to a compact SUV which our two suitcases and two carry on bags would not fit in. The trunk was very small and the SUV had no more room than a car. We went back to the counter and she told us we should have upgraded. I asked for a mid-sized SUV and explained that this is what I booked - not the compact SUV she gave us. She said a "compact SUV and a mid-sized SUV are the same". She would not give us any other vehicles unless we agreed to the $32 a day upcharge. We had already wasted 45 minutes trying to explain to her that the car she first gave us was not what she booked and then walking back out to the area where the cars were parked to look at the one she said was an upcharge. We had plans and could not leave the airport any later. I went back to the app to make sure I had booked a mid-sized and found out that I did. I believe the clerk ripped us off and I am very upset. I cannot get anyone to answer the phone at Thrifty.</Review>

I had a truly terrible experience across several aspect of renting from this Thrifty/Hertz. For one, there was a line of ~30 patrons trying to check out vehicles when I arrived, with exactly one agent handling that line. The line alone took over an hour. Second, the car itself was the cheapest Hyundai they make, a far cry from the Ford Focus that the website promised, and the rear view mirror fell off seconds after I got in the car for the first time. Third, although I confirmed with the agent at the counter that I would be charged for two days for the times of my checkout and return, and followed those times exactly, I was charged for three days without a clear notification that the terms had been changed. I waited for an hour to talk to a representative in the billing department, who told me to return to the rental location and try to find to the agent who had promised the two-day rate. If that were even possible it would be a multi-hour nightmare given how understaffed they are. I would not rent from this company and location again, and urge you not to either.<//review>

<review>Watch out. This company will try to scam you when you return the car. They charged me after the fact for a full tank of gas, even though I have receipt of my gas fill-up, and photo evidence of the fuel gauge. Such a hassle getting my money back from them. Word from the wise. Go with a different company.</review>< Pics>

<review>Deceitful approach to car rentals.

I reserved a car with Thrifty via HotWire, agreed to paid for the insurance and paid for my reservation ($260). When I came to the counter, I showed to the attendant a copy of my insurance contract that she acknowledged it. Additionally, she made a point that it was advantageous to change the refueling option and really made it sound like a good deal. When I returned the car Thrifty charged me another $145 for insurance and other fees that were already paid for. My last time with this company.</review>< userid>

Very dishonest company. They did not have a car that I had reserved and offered a replacement. The representative told me it was only one extra dollar a day. Unfortunately I signed the documents without looking at my bill first. It was 5 times higher than my reservation estimate. They did not honor the deal given to me at the time of reserving it online, charged me for two days instead of one and added an upgrade fee for the upgrade I did not ask. It was their fault they did not have the right car. The representative used bate and switch tactic like a professional con artist, she also intentionally talked very quietly, so I could not hear her and had to either ask to repeat or agree to whatever she was saying. The manager did not want to refund me for the extra charges and said I accepted the terms when drove away. Crooks and thieves. I am going to file an official complaint to BBB.< /text>

<Review>Ask to see the agreement before you sign! They don't print the contract out or walk through any of the charges prior to requesting your signature on the digital signature pad. They never mentioned  anything about insurance options, but put an $18/day insurance charge on the contract, even after I'd declined the insurance online.

I called customer service and was lectured about reading a contract. When I told the rep that I never saw the contract prior to signing the pad and expected it to match my online reservation, he told me, "this is America. You have to watch out because people will try to take advantage of you." Odd statement, but it confirmed that Thrifty makes money by taking advantage of people.

Pick any other rental company. Seriously, take the 5 minutes to sign up for emerald aisle, or register for turo. Hell, take a taxi everywhere. It'll be cheaper than thrifty by the time you're done.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

The staff at the level 4 service desk was  obviously unhappy to work on Thanksgiving. She was very engaged in talking to the other Dollar/Thrifty employees and joking with them. We were treated like unwanted guests who were being tolerated. My credit card was flung on the table top, I was spoken down to, I even had to ask for basic instructions on how to collect the rental car. I guess the female staff need to be retrained or fired. The guys at the booth at level 2 were polite and happy to serve. Why such a difference between the two? You can do better Thrifty. The customer service needs  attention.< /text>

If any one goes here please be focused and be knowledgeable  while talking to front desk guys else they will make you fool by not giving all insurance options available to you and forcing you to choose the car what ever they have. They simply make you purchase their insurance.In my case  I realized that I could have extended my own car insurance to rental car with out purchasing insurance with thrifty. I ended up paying double amount insurance than renting car, I regretted for it. Please be aware of it and they never be nice with you once you purchase.
It is waste  of time talking to customer care to solve your issues.<//Review>

Came here a few months ago and forgot to write a review. Had a good experience here, our customer service rep, I think his name was yibit (Asian guy, worked the front desk, really funny) was great. We were debating on upgrading our car and he was patiently helped us with the different options. He even requested to bring the cars down to see the options in person, and to make sure it luggage fit. Highly recommend, great customer service.<//Text>

<username>Roy M.</username><Review>They’re not in the rental car business but in the auto insurance business.  Insurance costs double the actual rental car price.

You think you’re getting a good deal at $17 for a rental but then you have $24 in fees and $41 in car insurance for a total over $80 lol.

That said, the car ran fine.<//Review>< Time>

I would give Zero stars... Purchased through Priceline WITH full coverage insurance.  They duped us into signing for double coverage (“sign here for insurance)   We should have asked more questions, but how SHADY.  Good companies don’t do that.  We called for a refund: “you signed for it, so we charged you”.    Gross, just gross.  Rent somewhere else with better morals.<//review>

One of the worst experience ever.... stay clear of Candy or Candice at the desk. There is no customer service and how to talk to a customer.

I got there around Mid-night @ SFO with my reservation, initially they couldn't find my reservation, even with a confirmation email, she said she cant do anything. I asked for a manager, so she goes in the room and comes back, saying he cant do anything either since its not in the system, when I insisted that I need to talk to the manager, she said she  "reserve the right to refuse service"... my jaw dropped when I heard that. I waited for the manager for about 40 minutes and then on consistently asking for a manager, he decided to show up... in the mean time neither she or anyone was willing to talk or help us. They were hoping that I would just leave out of frustration or rent the car at a higher rate.

Finally the manager showed up when I insisted that I need to talk to some one who can help me out... finally when he showed up suddenly my reservation showed up too.

Primarily they were trying to make me rent the car @ $90.00 when I have reserved it at $13.00.

Its just a sorry state of business when it comes to this. Just be a look out to these tactics when they are willing to do anything to make some more money.<//text>

I recently rented a car. My phone would connect to the bluetooth but wouldn't cooperate for maps/navigation. Don, was extremely 6 and patient. Not only did he help me get connected. He took me to several  cars until I was able to get connected and comfortable with the 2019 car. He went above and beyond exceeding all expectations!</Review>

After a long flight and with a car reserved, you don't expect another one hour wait in line to pick up a car.  Enterprise and Alamo have no line.  Poorly sign posted at SFO airport.  Counter clerks wasting time trying to get people to upgrade.  Poor shoe so far will amend the review if I find anything good.< /review>

What a DISGRACE! Where do I even start. Staff was rude. Lineups were massive. Countless number of people were being told there were no cars for them despite fact they had reservation.

<text>I can say nothing good about this company, we arrived after a long flight and to cut a long story short the rep tried to scam us completely, firstly by supposedly not having our vehicle and charging us for a larger vehicle, then secondly by scare mongering us into buying insurance. After over an hour of hassle we ended up buying some insurance, and with the manager's assistance, the car we originally booked, but their charges are ridiculous and sales tactics beyond belief. One star is far too generous for this company, my advice is to look elsewhere to hire your car in San Francisco.

<review>Better to choose another company, i don’t recommend them. They manipulate you like a baby to get more out of your pocket, specially if you come unprepared for psychological tricks. We felt like stupid idiots few minutes after signing an agreement .. i will never come back.</review></record>

<Text>Never change your car as the staff will do everything to rob you. In our case philippine women did the change with the same amount as the initial price of the car, so we paid double price for the car. She never said a word about additional service, or extra price or anything about that we are paying for upgrade and not for just simple change of the car. So if were so unlucky and booked something with this sh... company do not agree on anything except you have already booked, do not pay any money and do not sign anything except the agreement with the same number as your mentioned in your booking.</Text>< UserId.>

SCAM! We rented a car for 15 days. We requested no insurance (premium roadside insirance) as we previously bought 3rd party insurance. She still put it on the policy and we requested it to be taken off. She said she put a comment on the system and told us to email. I emailed but never received any reply. I called the main customer center and they said there was no note on file! We lost 170 euros!</Text>

<review>Just textbook bad customer service. Not very friendly. Had a computer issue on their end and never apologized for the 5-10 minute delay. Didn’t thank us for the business or wish us a good trip. Purely transactional and “f#%$ you pay me” mentality. Had no problem trying to upsell us to the next highest package and making comments that insulted our intelligence. Unprofessional in the fact she had no name tag but she was brunette working around 4:00p on Wed 12/4. Upon leaving, unprofessional procedure for reporting existing damage and we had to ask to even be presented with a form to fill out that info; something that comes standard at almost every rental car company we’ve ever encountered. Very put off from the lack of regard for service and I would not be proud to work for this location.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

< review>
Scammer car rental company! The guy at the counter barely speaks English and lure me into signing contract opposite of what I specifically told him to do. Now Thrifty is charging me extra $100 for things I specifically do not agree and their customer service line are just as awful for telling me to call another department and another department.... it just never ends, they do not care about their customer! The guy at the counter also continuously upselling and telling lies just to get me accept more contract agreement. This is totally unacceptable for such big corporate company to be scamming people. This is my first time using Thrifty and will be my last, I had been a regular customer with Enterprise and National in the past and always have the best professional experience and people doing honest business, they never try to upsell stuff that I do not need. The response at this review page will tell you to contact their facebook customer experience rep. which I already did and got no where.</review>

On 03/15/2019 got to the counter with my voucher showing I purchased and paid my whole vacation through Expedia (Flight, Hotel & Car) and the attendant began to offer me a vehicle different from the one I chose one month earlier. He also offered me a bunch of coverages for the vehicle. I said NOT to everything I was offered arguing if they have a car rental company their vehicles are already insured. However, 3 days after I got home I was amazed Thrifty had charged me US$316 for coverages and taxes I never approved for my rental.
I tried very hard to explain with them and with my credit card company over the phone. But after days making calls they got away with it and charged me $316 for nothing.
Folks, when you get to the counter of this car rental company demand for the total will be charged before you sign the vehicle pick up. Or better don’t even try to rent a car through this company.
The reason they get away with this SCAM is the credit card holder SIGNED THE CONTRACT AND APPROVED THE NEW COVERAGES THEY ARE MAKING UP when you think you are signing for the vehicle pick up.
“HOW IN THE WORLD A CAR RENTAL COMPANY  CHARGES EXTRA MONEY TO A CUSTOMER WHOSE CAR RENTAL AND WHOLE TRIP VACATION WAS ALREADY PAID THROUGH EXPEDIA”
I ended up paying 2 times for the same 5 days car rental.< /Review>< Pics>

Had I read the reviews, I would have been reminded of an experience at Thrifty over a year ago. Dont go with the cheapest price unless you have plenty of time on your hands. The lines at SFO are just ridiculous! I'm here on a Saturday AM - not during rush hour- and the line is beyond the ropes and all the way down past neighboring car rental companies. I just do not understand why technology is not used more to alleviate these long lines. Where are the self serve kiosk? Next time, I will bypass Thrifty and pay the upcharge to rent from Enterprise.< /Text>

< review>
My experience was very positive.
Checkout was fast, my vehicle class was available, and staff was friendly.
Good & Bad - I obtained my car, settled in, turned it on, and was in the middle of synching my iPod to the radio when white smoke began to come out of the hood. I went back to the window and was immediately given a (larger) replacement. So yes it was a pain to have to transfer my luggage from one car to another...but in the end I got a class upgrade and no fuss.
One minor "complaint" - I seem to have at one time signed up for their rewards program (or something to that effect) and apparently I did NOT have to wait on the long line at the main counter for my vehicle. If my confirmation email had included some type of reminder, I would've saved myself a half hour wait on line.
But overall I am very happy, and will definitely use Thrifty again.</review>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>Customer service is absolutely non-existent. I can say that because I spent 7 consecutive days trying to find my way through automated messaging services and get in contact with a person who can actually hep me, only to give up and pay somebody to go there in person. Absolutely the worst rental service I have had the displeasure of dealing with.

Edit: They will most likely respond to this with an automated message, supplying me with one of the same series of phone numbers that lead ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE. This is the worst excuse for a business I have ever seen.

Edit #2: Oh, that's new, they left a different comment! I messaged them like they said and once again! Automated response system that leads nowhere!<//Review>< gmapID>

I booked a car for about a week, 2 months ago. When I first booked my reservation I agreed to paid 140 dollars on internet including the age fees because I am only 21. When I arrived at the store, the man who was there took my card used it to pay and then showed me the receipt for a total of 700 dollars ( including the 200 dollars of deposit ). I didn't agree to pay that much and If I had known I wouldn't have chose this company. Since then I contested the amount with my bank but still no response I hope I will get reimbursed</text>

<review>FRAUD company that signed me up for $300 of insurance I NEVER agreed to or wanted, since I had other insurance. Stay far, far away and use a real company like Avis, where the price you see is the price you pay.

I will never return unless my insurance is refunded, Bob.<//review>< pictures>

Car reeked of Marijuana but at least it was nice and new. The main issue was the wait. Flight landed at 1200am. Had to wait almost an hour to get reservation. I even asked the lady at the desk checking us in if she knew there would be this many people and she said yes. Terrible planning!< /text>

The only issue is that when I booked, I booked at the intermediate car weekly rate, total of $239 (min 5 day, max 6 day), but inexplicably, the 4-day rate (as initially charged) was higher as charged for $274.  I would have thought that an early return would have at least been an equivalent charge.

<review>Great service. My car got a "maintenance required" signal light on but I was able to drive it to an airport and got the car exchanged.  Would have been better if this hadn't happened on my trip to the national parks (Yosemite, Sequoia, Kings Canyon), but I was out of the parks. That said, I was lucky that the car didn't light up like that at 10,000 feet of a Sierra Nevada Mountain.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Terrible. Much slow and expensive then Hertz.
Not satisfied at all. I made a reservation for a 170 dolar rent and end up with a 442 bill. I said to the attendent that I just want the basic protection, but he said I could not rent without addicional third parties protection. I was exausted and my family was waiting, we had a long road ahead in a foreign country, so i had no choice but to agree, because he said the third party liability waiver was mandatory. For a matter of comparison, the two previous weeks I rented a better car with hertz and it was cheaper, despite the fact that I rented in San Francisco and returned in Seattle.<//Text>< pictures>

I came in to SFO and needed a car for a couple days to visit someone in the hospital. They then let me extend over Christmas with my original unbelievable Hotwire rate saving me hundreds.

When I returned the agent found me a luggage cart. When I checked in I realized that I left my phone battery pack in the car. With most rental companies in this situation it would be l o n g gone. Not here. The Hertz (they own Thrifty) manager Chuck found it and brought it too me

<Date>1563470839362</Date><Text>Beware of this company!! I made an online reservation through Southwest Airlines.  I was originally quoted $499, I ended Up paying $1455.  There were a ton of hidden fees that I had no idea about one of which being an inner-city transfer fee of $300 since I was dropping off in  San Francisco and I had picked up in Portland. If I would’ve known this from the beginning it would’ve been such a surprise. The guy at the front counter said there was nothing he could do and this was the best price you could give me.  They coerce you into getting their subpar insurance at a hefty price.  Customer service all around was horrible front desk person, especially the personnel over the phone,  The guy at the drop off was OK.  Overall just a horrible experience will not use this company again. I know exactly how they will respond, with the pre-written, generic response saying Oh how sorry they are and to call this number That will take forever to get a response and plenty of automation!</Text><pics>None<//pics><user_id>107673370377917141392<//user_id>< Response>

<Text>At the front desk, there were staff assisting customers and automated phone booth like kiosks assisting customers. I got the automated phone version, and it was very quick. Being that I was a Blue Chip member, I was in and out in a jiff. All I had to do was confirm that I was me and then I got to go upstairs to the (wo)man-service kiosk and obtain the car park # and wait for an attendant to come and check us out.

The car was great and roomy (Nissan). Two free bottles of water were provided. We only drank one of them, but that's okay. The next person can enjoy the other bottle. We even had access to a built-in GPS to navigate around when our phones were down. The brakes were a little too quick to respond, especially when moving at 5mph.

The guy/attendant who assisted us upon checking in was very helpful. He provided us with maps and a car charger someone left behind. Unfortunately, the car charger did not work, but luckily I brought an extra battery for our phones in case.

At first, I was skeptical about renting from here, but I took a chance. I don't know why this Thrifty has such poor reviews. I found the service to be extremely helpful, the car was great, and my final bill was better than expected.

Happy travels!</Text><rate>5< /rate></record>

I rented out a mid-size car and the service was ok! The car Was old! I understand it’s a budget rental but still the heater in the car was not working. I was in a rush and was unable to refuel but it was 1/4 of the tank. Still they charged me 49.95 for the refuel.i would probably not rent again. Just didn’t feel like value for money provided having bunch of options to choose from<//Review>

<Text>My friend and I went to San Francisco. We decided to explore California by renting a car with thrifty in the San Francisco Airport. We had a really long flight and were assisted by a woman named Teylor. She asked if we wanted the premium insurance, and we told her clearly that we did NOT want it. She made us sign a document that we didn’t read because we were so tired and we thought that it was the 200€ deposit, we were caught by surprise when we returned the car and could see she had made us sign for the premium insurance (we think that the workers work off commissions and the woman wanted to take advantage of our fatigue and difficulty with the language, being from Spain). To add to all that, we called the last day to extend the car rental one more day and they said there would be no additional cost if we returned it before 8. We got there at 6 and they charged us that day. We will never rent a car with this company again. My advice is to avoid this company, they even charged my card without any previous notice.<//Text>< UserId.>

I go to get my rental and they try to give me a compact car which would only hold 1 luggage.  I spoke to the manager and he said that I should not go based upon the information provided on my confirmation which you can see the picture of below.

Great deals but poor management. What travel industry provider only schedules four agents to work between Thrifty and Dollar on a major holiday weekend?
We've waited 2 hours so far and only 3/4 of the way thru the line. So much for booking ahead and "member" perks. Pay a little extra elsewhere... It will be a better start to your vacation.<//Review>

<text>Midsize must mean crackerbox.  This noisy, low to the ground deathtrap is pretty bad but at least I have a gauge now about levels.  That Thrifty even has a car like this tells me I won't be renting from them again.< /text></record></dataset><record>
<Review>Great price on a car that was basically new. No hidden costs. Check in is in the main Terminal and was really quick. Drop off is hard to find at SFO but that not a Thrifty issue, they have same drop off location as all other main car rentals<//Review>< Response>

<Text>I wish I would have got the name for the gentleman who helped me at the counter when I showed up for my rental. He was amazing and truly helped me out with an issue I had with my rental. I originally rented the car for 2 days and on the 2nd day, last minute had to call and extend it for a day. Then extended for 2 more days and never had issues. The return process was easy also.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808f782b5d839c71:0x79a3c88a391738d1</gmapID></record>

<review>Really long wait inline to get to an agent. There were no automated kiosks. Other rental companies did not have a 30 min wait to check out a car. Other companies had automated kiosks. Though they did not seem to have as many customers either, but that could be because they were more efficient. I don't really know.

However, once I got the car it was great. The car only had 8 miles on the speedometer. It was brand new and had that smell about it too. I would use them again but they need to find a way to get the wait line down. I understand it was Super Bowl weekend and the SF Bay Area was hosting it. Perhaps that is why the lines were long, but no one else seemed to have such long lines. Other companies did not seem to have as many customers.< /review><gmap_id>0x808f782b5d839c71:0x79a3c88a391738d1<//gmap_id>< pictures>

<Review>The guy at the counter made it seem like it was a good idea to have fasttrak for the 4 out of 16 days we were in San Fransisco. We stayed in Oakland and according to him all bridges require toll both ways. Didn´t say anything about being able to only book Fasttrak for the whole trip instead of just those 4 days either. I blame myself for being naive, but Thrifty for straight up lying in my face. After we used it 1 time on the first day and we experienced that they lied, we tried to remove the Fasttrak. Since we had used it 1 time we were told to come to the airport (after waiting hours on the phone) and there they just said that they couldn´t do anything.<//Review><Name>Wytse Slabbekoorn< /Name><resp>{'time': 1559925074715, 'text': "Hi, Wytse.

<rate>4<//rate><Review>We we're visiting San Francisco for a few days and had made a reservation with Thrifty. The reservation experience was average, but while returning the car, I forgot my DSLR camera in the car and didn't realize until later that night. Calling the help desk wasn't of much help, so I decided to go back to the airport rental key dispatch booth. The person at the booth was very courteous and he handled it quite professionally. Despite the fact that it was beyond their supported business hours, he coordinated with another team and within 15-20 minutes, they searched and found the camera in their lost & found storage. It was a great relief for us as we were flying back home the same night and would have lost hope of getting the camera back again.

Great customer service during the hour of need!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808f782b5d839c71:0x79a3c88a391738d1<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Don’t take the bate. They hold reservations but don’t hold the cars. Waited an hour in line and now going on a half an hour and they “are waiting on cars”. The management that runs this operation does not value its customers time and will gimmick its way into making money. Worst travel experience in the US I have ever had and I travel a lot. Stay away if you value your sanity.<//Review>

<text>I reserved a standard SUV and placed me in a Hyundai Santa Fe AWD which was pretty cool since I was headed up to Tahoe for a ski trip.  The process of renting and returning was fairly quick.  One thing they can improve on is allow customers to self pick the car.  This is a big plus and most companies such as Hertz and Alamo are offering already.</text>< Time>

<review>We had requested a premium car at the outset, and when we arrived at the counter we asked for something new in the fleet.  We were given a Volkswagen CC which was a pretty nice car with roomy seats, but not a lot of trunk room.  We did enjoy the car and the process went smoothly for check out and check in at SF airport.  Everyone was helpful and no high pressure add-ons.  We'll be back.</review>< pictures>

<review>Everything went like clockwork.  Your agent, Jessica, was fantastic.  Checking me in she was warm, friendly, and efficient.  Since I was not familiar with SF streets, she offered to have me follow her since we were both going east over the San Mateo bridge and then north.  She was just getting off work so I followed her and she was so careful to keep us together in the traffic - not easy - all the way to the 880 freeway.  That is for sure going above and beyond to help a customer!  She is a fantastic asset for your company.

The checkin and out were SO easy.  And the rate I got was so low my SF friends couldn't believe it.  Thank you, Thrifty!< /review></record>

The gentleman I was dealing with actually picked up the phone to call his manager and complain that they needed more staff because of the very long lineup.  The line up took over one hour.  The car we reserved 6 months earlier was not available.  Remember the Seinfeld episode about taking the reservation? The employees worked as quickly as they could.  The criticism should be reserved for management.  I rent a call every three months or so mostly for vacations.

I had prepaid for renting a car on the eve of Christmas for a whole week. I was one of the many people in the slow moving line. Waited for 2 hours until we were directed to go to the pick-up. There was a line at the pick-up too and after 2.5 hours of arriving at the rental office, I was given a huge truck instead of a sedan car that I had initially paid for. I had to haggle to get a sedan and was ultimately given one after expressing disappointment at their service. They didn’t have cars left for people that had already booked it much ahead of time! There were people cutting lines and the thrifty team at SFO was too slow and poorly organized! Also be beware of high admin charges at e-toll points.

Overall, I regret choosing Thrifty for my end-of-year vacation.< /Text>

I love the 5.0 Mustang, the RT Challenger, and the convertible SS Camaro. If you like fast you cant go wrong with any of the 3 but personally my favorite is the RT Challenger, the visibility in the Camaro isn't as good as I would have liked but it's still a nice car, and the 5.0 falls right in the middle it's smaller like the Camaro but still has good visibility and you can get a convertible or a hard top.< /Text>

<review>Horrible--RUN- Spend the extra money for quality.  I think they are running a scam with the Golden Gate Bridge.   You pay online (or so you think) for the toll, then get notified that you only "set up an account".  By the time you are notified, Thrifty has charged you $23.  Nice ancillary income method!  Long lines, rushed and rude help at car pick up...shoulda taken Uber.< /review>< pictures>

I was one of several dozen customers with every expection for a joyous San Francisco Bay Christmas. We arrived at SF Thrifty's counter at 9:45 pm on the 24th of December 2018. I left at approximately 2 am Christmas morningleaving most my unhappy companions waiting for cars.< /text>

Had pre-paid for a car and when we got to San Francisco we couldn't collect our car because their old card machine wouldn't read our card (the one used to pay for it already) because it only uses swipe. The card works everywhere else obviously the chip works, they don't have a chip reader and can't enter it in manually. People either side of us had  same problem< /review>

<text>NEVER EVER AGAIN - We hired a car for 10 days and they charged us for extra services that were never agreed upon at the counter. If you dare hire a car with this company make sure you read up to the smallest letter in the contract to avoid any unwanted surprises.

Even though they didn't have the size car I had planned to get available immediately, they made me a better offer on a smaller car.  It was a really swell experience.  We have used Thrifty for many years and have ALWAYS had a good experience!< /review>

<Review>I rented a car for 2 weeks for $285 which I thought was a phenomenal! I'm not sure why, but they said I was chosen for the manager's special and I was given a Mazda SUV which I loved. The only negatives were a waiting line of about a half hour and the guy at the desk seemed to be trying to huckster me a bit by trying to get me to pay for a full tank of gas so I wouldn't have to stop and get gas. I didn't like that at all, and turned it down. Didn't like his attitude. But the people downstairs who got the car for me and checked me back in were all fabulous. Still can't believe I got the car I did for two weeks for a total of $285! In San Francisco. I've told all my friends about it.</Review>< user>

The staff wasn't helpful at all. I flew into San Francisco from Philadelphia and had no idea that a plate pass was required to access several bridges that only accept this method of payment. The agent failed to brief me on this and I was forced to pay a extra $20 along with the price of the toll to access these particular bridges. That was a daily fee for any day you access a bridge which requires a toll. Also, I choose to pay for fuel in advance sonce I had a early flight out, which was explained that I'd only be charged for how much fuel that was needed upon my return. I returned the vehicle with a full tank just to find out that was false and they didn't want to refund my money. Almost missed my flight because no return agents were on duty when I returned and had to basically check myself in and argue just to get what was owed to me. Terrible experience and the overall airport is horrible.< /text>< name>

< review>
I am 24yo. I paid with my credit card but we had a car rental under my friend's name who is older than 25yo.
They need the booking to be one the same name as the name on the card. Because we booked and prepaid online with my credit card, we couldn't switch for my friend debit card. They don't allow to switch a credit card for a debit card even if we have a return flight so are obviously going to come back with the car.
We got $25 surcharge per day because of that. The guy didn't tell us we could just cancel and rebook with the debit card before everything was finalized. This is really outrageous. Won't book a car here ever again.</review>

Arrived from my flight at 12:30 and queued in a huge line for Thrifty with no attendant to be seen. 1 o'clock rolls around and the Dollar rental attendant leaves and tells us that all the attendants get off at 1 so we should just head up to the key kiosk. Wait in key kiosk line for forever as well. Add this time onto the driving time I have to do to drive down to Santa Cruz.

<review>My experience at the counter was great so I thought. He gave me an estimate for the rental and had me to initial it. But when I returned the car, the price suddenly jumped up by $300!  This was my first rental from Thrifty and more than likely my last. I'll stick with my usual rental companies-- Enterprise, Hertz and Avis.< /review><name>Abby Page< /name>< Date>

Arrived September 2, 2018 to pick up my rental that was already paid for through Expedia. I was speaking with a person who was less than helpful. Who stated that if I wasn't using a credit card, rather, a debit card that she would be running my credit. To which I was was not happy about and asked if it was a soft run or a hard inquiry? She was hesitant but lied and said it was a soft run. Due to her hesitation, I asked her to show me in writing where it states that the credit would be run as this was never disclosed prior to picking up the car. She couldn't do that so I asked for a manager. I got "pinky" that's the managers name. That's all she would give me. I posed the same question to her and she handed me an 11 page pamphlet filled with fine print and said "it's in there"
I asked if she could show me where it was and she refused and said "you can read it" however, admitted that they didn't know if it was a soft run or a hard inquiry on my credit. I looked for it as quickly as I could as the line grew out the airport door. To no avail. It's not in the literature. Moral to the story: "Pinky" and her "half a brain" sidekick were rude and need to be fired. I will never rent with Thrifty again, I'd rather pay more somewhere else even if they run my credit, all due to the lack of customer service at Thrifty car rental. Oh btw, they refused to give me the number for the corporate office as well. It was completely inappropriate. "Pinky" was not concerned at all about the line of about 35 people deep (that's a conservative number) as I had to stand there looking for the information in the 11 pages of fine print. Never Ever rent with Thrifty!< /Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>The vehicle was the worst car that I have ever rented. The condition was poor at best. It had been in two accidents and there will stickers on the car reflecting the damage. The car was dirty both inside and out. I had to use a sewing needle to get the windshield washer to work and I had to purchase windshield wash to fill the reservoir. If I wasn't on such a tight timeline, I would have brought it back after the first day.  My advice is to fully check your rental prior to departure.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

The bad feedback is for the employee at the airport. I rented a lot of cars in the past en i´m used te the questions to upgrade, but i never met someone who was so agressive and lying as this employes. We had a car from the B-group, but that car would not be able to drive the roads in america, she ensured us multiple times. We did´t want to change to an upgrade. She recommended a pass for the tollroads, but we were not interested (we saw 1 road in 3500miles travel, wich we could pass easely). She kept asking, and told us that it was stupid not to trust her if we were traveling low budget, as we also had chosen a cheap car. The same story with our choise to fill the car ourself with fuill. We told her many times we didn´t wanted Anything extra. At the end she gave us a bill with 311 dollar. I asked her 4 times what that amount was for and what that insurence was, because we already had one en didn´t want anything extra. She didn´t explain that it was an extra insurance, but kept saying that we had to pay that. I asked several times.
I understand that carhirecompanies try to sell stuff and ask time after time, but this was rude en also misleading/lying. Thats really unacceptable!!
We enjoyed our car and didn´t had any troubles with it allong the way, so that was ok. Also the pickup and bringing back was very easy and quick. The garage is easy to find at the airport. The woman at the desk, made it a feedback of 1 star, worst ever!!!</review>

AVOID - COMPLETE SCAM! (San Francisico)
Unless you want to end up with a $300 charge for an insurance option you DID NOT want, stay away from this terrible scam of a rental company. We had prepaid online for our rental, the desk person printed out an arms-length receipt, folded it and stapled it and then said to sign the bottom. After waiting for an hour in line, with thirty other people behind us, we explicitly said we don't need any additional options, no insurance...nothing! But of course, a week after we come back home we end up with a $300 insurance charge that they won't refund. They make their money off of these dishonest methods. I will NEVER EVER go back. I'd rather go to a reputable company than EVER deal with this again! Frustrating, and complete waste of time. They have no customer service, and couldn't care less about the customer, YOU!<//review>

<Review>DO NOT USE.  We rented a premium SUV for a SKI trip.  The car broke down and we were told to drive it to Sacremento Airport to collect another one even though it was not fit to drive.  Had no choice in the matter!  We arrived at Sacramento airport  only to be told that they only had two wheel drive vehicles available.  Arrived in Tahoe 4 hours later due to inconvenience of it all.  Tried to sort it the next day, noone could help.  The only option we were advised was to drive it back to SFO to collect another our wheel drive vehicle.  Could not drive anywhere in a two wheel drive due to the snow storm, however, Thrifty employees continuously advised us to risk our lives whilst on vacation and repeatedly told us there was nothing they could do for us.  Four days later we were still dealing with the saga.  Completely ruined our holiday.  Now going through a lawyer to get all of our money back, suing for ruining our vacation and loss of time, phone calls.  Oh they cannot dial international numbers so be wary of that too.  Exceptionally horrific experience.  Avoid and pay more to be with a reputable company!!!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I was really upset by the service I had gotten. The individual at the front desk would talk to me as if I never rented a car before. Told me that I had bring in a receipt if I decided to fill up the gas outside of the airport. I have rented a car through dollar and thrify before and I have never had anyone blatantly lie to my face. I was also told that I could not register the cars plates for the tolls which i found out later was a lie. I ended up spending $74 for 2 tolls that totaled $12. I spoke to someone when I dropped the car about the toll issue and they didnt care. I am most likely going to report them to the BBB and file an executive complaint.<//Review><Date>1517344627624</Date><Response>None</Response>< Rating>

I am a frequent traveler and renter from Thrifty. The SFO pickup went as usual, but the definitions for 'full sized' car have evolved over the last few years. The car I received was fairly new and clean. There were problems with it mid-trip, but obtained a replacement car without too much effort. Extra fees complained about by others are due to the local and or state government at the renting location and are not Thrifty's (or any other car rental agency) fault.<//review>

<Text>It was a good experience overall. I had trouble initially with the pricing quoted online booked via AAA. AAA gave me a lower price but somehow Thrifty was showing a higher price when I called to reconfirm my booking. I tried to resolve it on phone but thrifty agent couldn't correct the price. Agent suggested to talk to the local manager when Im about to rent the car. The local Manager at SFO airport was super helpful and able honor the AAA price. I give them 4 star only because of the manager - Marlon. Otherwise they would have received only 1 star.</Text>< Pics>

THRIFTY SFO CAN NOT BE TRUSTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In three years as a Blue Chip, not one of the six cars I rented at SFO were ever ready to go. Not a single one! But this last time they achieved a new low, paperwork and keys were in the car, but the guard at the gate sent me back to the booth because the paperwork didn't match the car. But, this wasn't the worst of it.  The car like usual was covered with thousands of hard water spots.  But this time when I return the car, the agent (Emma) claimed one of the hard water spots was actually a chip in the windshield, and made me sign a damaged car form. So,  if you like being robbed Thrifty is the perfect choice.  As for me I am never renting there again!<//Review>

Reserved a car for 5 days with an estimated charge of $110.53.  Plans changed and had to return the car a day early and they charged me $586.53 for the car.  Pulled a rental rate out of thin air of $146 A DAY.  Looked on their website several times and the rate for the car I rented is NEVER more then $50.  They charged me 3 times as much as there maximum advertised rate.  Customer Service totally unresponsive.  NEVER AGAIN will I use this company and neither should you!< /text>

< Review>
SFO car rental center was a mad house, so was very happy to be a Blue Chip member.  Got right to our car and there is a cigarette burn on the passenger seat.  I asked a man sitting at a desk in the Thrifty area for a damage slip.  He told me I could get a slip at the Thrifty kiosk-booth, which had a line 10 deep.  Decided to skip the damage slip and take our chances.  As we were checking out, the SAME MAN waited on us, and my husband asked for a damage slip, which the man ran off to get him immediately.  Unreal!  During the 6 days with the car; tire pressure low light came on, and ran out of washer fluid.  More our fault, but went over the Golden Gate Bridge without a transponder and was assessed a toll and fine by Thrifty.<//Review>

UNFORTUNATELY I HAD TO GIVE THEM ATLEAST 1 STAR. I would give them a big fat ZERO, if I could. WORST customer  service ever, from the cashier LAHN. Being knowledgeable of your company's policy should be a requirement for all employees. LAHNwas very rude, and unhelpful. We booked and paid in full through a 3rd party via debit card. LAN DID NOT HONOR IT because we needed a major cc, that is fine. However, she did not offer to create a new rental reservation for us as walk-up customers. At this time it was 1am. When we brought up the debit card policy and create a new reservation, she had an attitude as if she did not want to rent for. Then she profiled us as if, we were poor, black, uneducated, with bad credit. When I explained to her what she was doing and how she treated us with total disregard, it was then she started to try and redeem herself. No ma'am. I will be calling corporate and filing a complaint.<//Review>

Rented their car for 2 weeks. The Buick Regal had low mileage on it, drove well and I have no complaints for the car rented.  Unfortunately at the end of my trip, after filling it up regularly and never letting the tank get less than half empty, they tried telling me that it was 2 gallons under full. I questioned this, only after having an argument with the attendant (albeit regrettably) and they took off the extra $23 charge (for 2 gallons).  I feel that this was a money scheme, knowing that the gas gauge never truly set at full. I was nickle-n-dimed all the way.< /Text>

It is like any other car rental place, too many people not enough support. I think, the mgt should figure out how best to give support to their customers.</review>

Sadly the other reviews explaining Thrifty scams are accurate. I rented a car from here for 10 days, it was pre paid through expedia. Thrifty added numerous charges that I did not ask for. Be warned, if you do rent from them check absolutely everything you sign as they will have added things you didn't ask for and expect you to pay up when you sign.< /text>

Choose this unless you buy insurance and you mind bad car.

Cons
Bundles of hidden costs and no transparent business

Full Review
1. Rental fee itself is relatively cheap. This is the major reason I chose this company online.

2. Rental auto was the worst I ever rented.

3. Buying full coverage insurance cost $39/day for a full size car. No mention about this cost online.

4. They charge, without informing you, $4.99 for road services (which is an option) to be rendered when thrifty's own rental car fails on the road. No apologizing for not informing me of the inclusion of the fee. Staff acted as if I must be a weird guy not to choose the option.
-- Renting cars in poor condition, and then we pay for the service invoked by the poor condition of the car!!!

5. They change many options I had chosen online (even the car size (dollar rent-a-car, same ownership as thrifty I think) without saying anything. Having unexpected such unsual (usual for them?) behavior, I signed the contract.

6. Overall, you pay the same or more for a worse car and unpleasant service if you choose thrifty than if you choose other well-known rent-a-car company.

Dishonest thieves for workers. Left my phone in the rental. Locked the device remotely and put my contact information. Phone was never found according to Thrifty. However, the device was turned off within 20 minutes of the return and now I am receiving text messages to a scam iCloud website attempting to gain my credentials to unlock the phone.</Review>

The people behind the counter will rip you off. They tell you the insurance is mandatory when it is in fact not. Most credit cards cover your car rental insurance but they will tell you its mandatory supplemental coverage that you must purchase from them.  Then they proceed to tell you the bridges in the area do not take cash and they push Plate Pass on you.  There are other ways to get to Napa than the Golden Gate Bridge, and FYI that is the only one that does not take cash and is out of the way by a few minutes from the airport anyway.  Shame on you Thrifty management for making your employees push bogus information and making us hate the car rental process even more, especially those by airports with your insane fees/charges. Grow some ethics and moral character.
However I filed a complaint and they heard me out, and are refunding me the cost of the unnecessary insurance.  The plate pass is still charged in full to me.  Do your homework on the driving routes to avoid the platepass only golden gate bridge.</Review>

<Review>Car rental experience was great overall. Prompt service and effective customer service. Someone broke into my van my first night in San Francisco, they busted the driver window and stole my camera bag and my extra lense. I called roadside assistance right away and spoke to prompt and courteous reps, a tow truck was there roughly an hour and a half later and I had a new car ready as soon as I arrived. Returning the rental car can be a little confusing simply because the airport doesn't have many directional signs but overall clean car and prompt service. I will continue to rent with thifty. (Note : be careful when near ocean beach or by the Cliff House restaurant, this is where I got robbed and the police officer responded to five other car break in that day in that area.) Beautiful city, just high homeless population.< /Review>< pictures>

I canceled my Prem Road serv at first, and make a call to your customer service, they said I can get it cancel, also make a note on my rental record. Next day I drove hundred miles back to the place that I pickup my car at LA. They said I can cancel it when I return my car at SF airport.
But why, I return my car at SF airport, the clerk and manager said they can't do it. I have to talk with LA. They can't do it.

What is wrong with your company inside communication ?

Why your customer service and LA store said I can cancel, but your SF store said not. I have to pay it.

Good price; once I made it to the counter with 1/2 a truck load of luggage they took one look and up-sold me to a larger car (camry) with GPS... I figured it would be easier than using my phone anyhow.  My only issue was the camry I GOT didn't actally have it. Which I didn't notice until everything was loaded in and I was leaving.  ... I turned around and they were eventually able to sort it out, we switched everything to the new car and were off.  Not painless by any means, but it all worked out in the end.</review>

Dishonest staff.  Venus and I explicitly discussed not needing any additional insurance as this rental was under a government contract, yet "supplemental insurance" was added to my contract.  I did not notice until filing my expenses later.

The line was horribly long, and there were also tons of special fees and taxes, and this prevented me from poring over the contract while at the desk.  Normally, I wouldn't blame this on Thrifty -- but their rep, Venus, confirmed in person that I was not being charged for any additional insurance.  Dishonest.</text>

<text>Lesson learned, the name says it all! Thrifty and cheapest option? Yes. Quality and good customer service? Absolutely not!

After the long flight from the east coast to SFO my SO and I couldn't wait to start our vacation by picking up our rental car that we had booked online months in advance. Not only did we get the runaround from the poor signage at the airport (we needed to "check-in" before we picked up our keys on a different floor) but we encountered the horror that so many other reviewers mentioned of unimaginably SLOW lines with 2.5 associates scrambling (yes one of them disappeared 1/2 through the shift). I was worried we'd miss the pick up time of 11:15am since half an hour passed and we only moved a few feet forward. Then I realized time was not a concept in this vortex. Somewhat fortunately for us we were not at the worst part of it since more disgruntled bodies soon piled in from other flights arriving later.

I did what any reasonable consumer would do to pass the time. I indulged myself on the horrible Yelp reviews from other poor souls, and pitied myself for not seeing the warning signs earlier.  By noon we were nearly at the front of the line seeing the light at the end of this interminable tunnel. We were finally next!!! Surprisingly the actual interactions with the associate were pleasant and I felt bad that one of her co-workers left her hanging as she was supposed to take her lunch break right now. She gave us the info and directed us to check in to pick up our keys for the most basic Toyota Yaris so we could be on our merry way. The most basic model had so many strange quirks such as manual adjustment of the side mirrors and unadjustable seat height. That would have definitely been an issue for a shortly like me but thankfully my SO drove. We couldn't wait to get out of there and they had the car ready for us within 10 minutes, which felt like lightning compared to the hour long saga.

The only other huge pain was trying to find a gas station within 4 or 5 miles of the airport to refill the tank (but I think that's standard policy for most rental car companies). We nearly missed our flight with this ordeal and our poor navigational skills so I would recommend planning ahead for this! Dropping off the car was surprisingly a breeze and we didn't incur any of those dreaded extra charges even though I'm pretty sure we went over several bridges that probably had tolls.<//text><rating>2</rating>< Name>

Booked a car at JFK - had to wait for quite a long time for a pickup although there was only one person before us, and we were in a hurry. When we were finally served, the rental fee changed from 60 to 200 dollars for two days when they added all the hidden extras. And finally, when we wanted to return the car to their Manhattan agency instead of the airport, prepared to pay the fee, they made this so complicated and wasted so much of our time. I definitly would not recommend booking with them and wish I never had done that myself.</review>< Name>

The bad experience with Thrifty makes me post comments online for the first time. It is unfortunate that I cannot give 0 stars. For details of my experience, please refer to other comments which are all right and just.

On top of that, let me add that our bill includes two mysterious charges called "Cntyrntitax" and "apconrecfee", which give us no clue of what it is unlike other items. These two items DID NOT appear in our arm-long receipt too. I encourage everyone to check ALL items on the bill.

- Waiting time at SFO to take the car: 1 hour. Lucky that my embassy is willing to wait for me to hand in my passport application.
- All charges: $200, for two day rental.<//text>

We decided to save money and have him fly to San Francisco International Airport and he would rent a car and travel to Humboldt that way. We booked the car rental on Hotwire, and we decided to go with Thrifty, we were quoted (for all taxes and fees) $157. That seemed like a reasonable price, and Thrifty even said we were getting a great deal.

My husband shows up to the counter in SFO, with his quote in hand. There was some woman named Ann, who apparently knew how to make her company money by manipulating the situation of travelers, good for her, BAD for all of you reading this.

Ann tells my husband he really should have insurance and roadside assistance. Isn’t that nice of her looking out for my husband? Well, $80 somethin dollars later he had insurance and roadside assistance. That is how much our monthly insurance costs us…so of course $80 insurance for four days seems like a bargain right? Wrong, don’t do it, not worth it.
Then she tells him he should get the fuel fill up on the car so he can bring it back and not have to fill it up. I don’t know where on God’s green earth it would cost over $60 to fill up a compact car from half tank (that is what it would be at coming back from Humboldt) but apparently, that was a good idea too.

She sweet talked my husband into all of this with the poison of her words. Don’t do it!

Now, here is where it really is a Thrifty issue….They tell him they have to ADD more fees to his car because well he took it from the airport. What is funny is that on our statement it said he was getting his car from the airport, and it already included those fees. So these sweet talking ass holes decide to charge him more money, because well, apparently he looked like easy money. Then apparently they charged all these other fees on top of the $157, even though those fees were supposedly tucked into the $157 quote. Apparently these fools just pull fees out of their ass and tack them on to tired travelers who just want to go.

Jerk offs. So he calls them not even 24 hours after to tell them to take those things off (after a very furious wife told him too), the very very unhelpful customer service reps tell him that he actually has to go to SACRAMENTO to take those off. See the issue, these rat bastards see it, He drove 6 hours from SFO to Humboldt. He would have to drive another 6 from Humboldt TO Sacramento to take care of this, and however many hours back to Humboldt or SFO. Are you kidding? No one can do that. They wouldn’t help him, they wouldn’t give any money back. I promise if he were to return his car FULL with gas those fools would STILL charge him the $60+ dollars for nothing.

So…$360 later…yes $200 more than we were quoted…we have our very sucky situation in which we can do nothing. Isn’t that great? This company blows and I hope none of you ever try to rent a car from here. Ever…

My advice, these guys are liars, and poison drips from their mouths. Stay away, you are much better off spending like $50 more on a different and better quality car rental place. Don’t get any unnecessary stuff, and PLEASE oh PLEASE make sure they stay close to your quoted price, and that they don’t have bogus fees on the contract.

Terrible experience. Not the fault of the desk managers at all but a company leadership and management problem. There were clearly dozens of reservations late at night but only 1 to 2 people handling them all.  Waited in line well over an hour.  The rest of the car rental companies in San Francisco airport appeared to have no wait issues.</text>

Terrible experience!  Overcharged me by $300 and when i spoke to manager Alan, at the SF airport he practically laughed in my face and said there was nothing he could do to fix it.  Then he simple walked away.  He should be fired and the fact that there is such poor and unethical businesses out there such as Thrifty is very depressing and unfortunate.< /Review>

< Review>
Out of all the locations I have encountered (including LA and Toronto airport) this is by far the absolute worst. They are understaffed; the employees have no idea how to assist you and could really care less. I returned my car on time and left a pair of sunglasses, charger and parking ticket. Returned in less than 5 min to retrieve them and the girl tells me to file a loss claim, I could see the car from where I was and she would not let me go in it (she said “I didn’t see anything”). I called and tried to get my items and the branch kept sending me to the website (filled out a claim form and never heard anything about my items being found)Paid the parking violation and they still charged me a $30 fee because apparently the City had already notified them…I ended up being charged double, called to get a refund and they told me it was a processing fee (for what? I took care of it). Called the third party (ATS) who handles their violations and they offered me 15 dollars (a joke). To sum it up, this rental cost me around $1000. Go with Budget and get a luxury car instead.<//Review>

1. It took us 45 minutes to get our already reserved car with only 3 customers ahead of us. This was Friday night on a labor day weekend with only 2 employees on duty at the rental counter. Extremely bad service on that part. The lady was very courteous though so 5 stars just for her.

2. There were only 2 mid-size SUVs in the lot and we got the Jeep compass, such a bad car!! The space and everything was good but the acceleration was so bad!

3. We had the car for 8 days and at the end of day 1 "change oil" warning came up. I called to get me a replacement and i get a response "oh you can drive for a 1000 miles or get the oil change done yourself, we dont have any cars available for replacement". I was like what?!? And then he said "oh we have sedans available if you want it?" I was like no, we reserved a midsize SUV for a reason. Called three times but no cars available in the sfo or san jose, ca area.

Very bad experience on the professionalism and customer service part. Don't rent from thrifty if you are looking for good customer service. The car worked out fine for us though so no complaints there but horrible company and worst customer service ever!<//review>

Do not rent here! I was tricked to pay Loss Damage Waiver which is US$38.49 per day for the minivan I rented. BTW, LDW is optional. My total expense  for the car almost doubled. I probably will not rent from this company again.<//text>

<text>Never Thrifty again!!! Worst customer service and really unfriendly agents. Especially “Maira” and the manager “Eric” were unbelievable unfriendly. We had no chance to get our car at the counter at San Francisco Airport. Never Thrifty again!!!< /text>< Pictures>

STAY AWAY!!!! I was quoted $40/day for 3 days and when I returned the car the rate "magically" changed to $44/day.  The worker tried to hurry me along before I noticed the discrepancy in rate between the paperwork from when I checked the car out to when I dropped the car off.  SHADY PRACTICES to overcharge you.  STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!!!!!</text>

These guys commit Fraud on a daily basis. Don't rent from them. These guys told us the only way to cross the golden gate bridge and pay the toll was to get their $11.99 per day coverage, i asked several times, we crossed the ridge once and ended up paying 35 bucks to cross the bridge. After we caught there fraud their customer service just comes back  and says "you signed the contract, you pay" Save yourself the trouble and go with someone else<//text>

this company is a fraud  , if i could give negative star i would as someone already wrote on the reviews
we got to SFO airport we had a reservation for SUV car , but when we got there we where told that there is no car available and the reservation is for compact car !!! we also found out we are not the only ones
we found ourselves looking for other company for like an hour until we find Budget  we took a SUV car from them and they gave us good costumer service
don't ever make the mistake we did with thrifty<//text>

(Translated by Google) I returned the car to the second floor of the multi-storey car park and there were 3 Thrify assistants available, very good. Check-out in 5 minutes with paper receipt. Paid $ 20 more than agreed upon for a difference in taxes that I didn't understand but ok, little thing.

Ho restituito l’auto la piano 2 del parcheggio multipiano e c’erano 3 assistenti di Thrify a disposizione, molto buono. Check-out in 5 minuti con ricevuta cartacea. Pagato 20$ in più di quanto pattuito per una differenza di tasse che non ho capito bene ma vabbé, poca cosa.</Text>

(Translated by Google) The delivery was less straightforward than at Hertz, we were canceled when we picked up the rental car contract and no one knew the back and front. So we had to wait 2 different employees and again 30 minutes before we could go.

Die Abgabe war weniger unkompliziert wie bei Hertz, uns wurde bei Abholung der Mietwagenvertrag storniert und es kannte sich hinten und vorne niemand mehr aus. So mussten wir 2 verschiedene Mitarbeiter und nochmal 30 Minuten aushalten, bis wir gehen konnten.<//review>

<review>(Translated by Google) After the bad reviews unsettled us: everything worked out for us, paid little, car as good as new and in good shape, no waiting times and stress-free returns. Of course they try to sell insurance, toll passes and larger cars, but you can also refuse. Gladly again.

(Original)
Nachdem uns die schlechten Bewertungen verunsichert haben: bei uns hat alles geklappt, wenig gezahlt, Wagen neuwertig und gut im Schuss, keine Wartezeiten und stressfreie Rückgabe.

<review>(Translated by Google) Never in this car rental company, lie in front of car rental online a Baoxiangongsi a year to buy car insurance, get the vehicles to the staff said credit card to pay a deposit, but the fact is that you have promised to buy their insurance , car hire price just meet with you, so do you think is paying cab fare, to see your credit card statement only to find that they will not bother you, because the number has passed, is an outrage.

(Original)
千萬不要在這公司租車,騙人,在租車前在網上一間保險公司買了一年車保，取車時工作人員說要信用卡付按金，但事實是你已答應買他們的保險，價錢剛剛跟你租車費相約，所以你以為是付租車費，到你看信用卡月結單才發現，他們也不會理會你，因為已過數，太可惡。<//review>< gmap_id>

So we went to the counter to get the car, the young woman welcomes us so far all are very well.
However she explains that the car for which we paid is no longer available so we end up with a RAV 4.
Which is supposedly a car of the "same category".
We are here to make a road trip, so we need a good car the RAV 4 is absolutely not the chosen car and is saying the only car that remains in the category SUV means! We are therefore obliged to be put in higher category if we wish to have another car (which is the ONLY AND UNIQUE CHOICE) !!
FINALLY, we paid 533 euros for the rental of the JEEP COMPAS but as we wanted to have another car we will have to pay the return of the car to LAS VEGAS 1000 DOLLARS MORE !!!!!!
And we have to deal with the VIP CAR society for the 500 euros we already pay for this so-called car that did not exist!
I THREADLY DECREE THRIFTY TO ALL PEOPLE WISHING TO RENT A VEHICLE IN THE USA !!
AND ESPECIALLY IN THE FRENCH COMMUNITY,
THEY ARE THIEVES.
WE HAVE A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS COMPANY.

Je déconseille vraiment THRIFTY, Voici ce qui nous est arrivées avec ma FIANCÉE lors de notre arrivée à L'AÉROPORT DE SAN FRANCISCO , nous avions loués une voiture sur internet un mois auparavant par le biais de VIP CAR (société travaillant avec THRIFTY) la voiture était une JEEP COMPAS.  Nous nous sommes donc rendus au comptoir afin de récupérer la voiture, la jeune femme nous accueille jusque là tous vas très bien.
En revanche elle nous explique que la voiture pour laquelle nous avons payés n'est plus disponible donc nous nous retrouvons avec UN RAV 4.
Qui est soit disant une voiture de la "même catégorie".
Nous sommes ici afin d'effectuer un road trip,  et nous avons donc besoin d'une bonne voiture le RAV 4 n'étant absolument pas la voiture choisis et soit disant la seule et unique voiture qu'il reste dans la catégorie moyens SUV ! Nous sommes donc obligés d'être mis en catégorie supérieure si nous souhaitons avoir une autre voiture (qui est le SEUL ET UNIQUE CHOIX) !!
EN DÉFINITIVE, nous avons payés 533 euros pour la location de la JEEP COMPAS mais comme nous souhaitions avoir une autre voiture nous devrons payé au retour de la voiture à LAS VEGAS 1000 DOLLARS EN PLUS!!!!!!
Et nous devons nous débrouiller avec la société VIP CAR pour les 500 euros que nous avons déjà verser pour cette sois disant voiture qui n'existait pas!
JE DÉCONSEILLE VIVEMENT THRIFTY A TOUTE PERSONNES SOUHAITANT LOUER UN VÉHICULE AUX USA!!
ET SURTOUT À LA COMMUNAUTÉ FRANÇAISE ,
CE SONT DES VOLEURS.
NOUS AVONS EU UNE TRÈS MAUVAISE EXPÉRIENCE AVEC CETTE COMPAGNIE.<//review>< rate>

(Translated by Google) I really advise THRIFTY, this is what happened with my FIANCÉE when we arrived at SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT, we rented a car on the internet a month ago through VIP CAR (company working with THRIFTY) the car was a JEEP COMPAS. So we went to the counter to get the car, the young woman welcomes us so far all are very well.
However she explains that the car for which we paid is no longer available so we end up with a RAV 4.
Which is supposedly a car of the "same category".
We are here to make a road trip, so we need a good car the RAV 4 is absolutely not the chosen car and is saying the only car that remains in the category SUV means! We are therefore obliged to be put in higher category if we wish to have another car (which is the ONLY AND UNIQUE CHOICE) !!
FINALLY, we paid 533 euros for the rental of the JEEP COMPAS but as we wanted to have another car we will have to pay the return of the car to LAS VEGAS 1000 DOLLARS MORE !!!!!!
And we have to deal with the VIP CAR society for the 500 euros we already pay for this so-called car that did not exist!

(Translated by Google) Hands off, scammers!
Thrifty Car Rental can multiply tolls and call these administration fees. Passing the Golden Gate cost us $ 70 with a thrifty car.
A "Navisystem" is a 10 year old cell phone with poor reception and is therefore completely useless.

(Original)
Finger weg, Betrügerbande!
Thrifty Car Rental lässt sich Mautgebühren vervielfachen und nennt das administration fees. Die Golden Gate passieren kostete uns mit einem Auto von thrifty cars $70.

(Translated by Google) The worst. As a Frenchman I had booked online with my credit card, everything was niquel and inexpensive. I arrive to take the car, I am told that the credit card is not a credit card so I cannot use my reservation. They make me take a new reservation directly on site which amounts to just $ 400 more. with a deposit of $ 600 (for a week). In addition to being tricked, I didn't really have the choice (Jet lag, 1pm plane in my legs) I wanted to sleep. In short to flee so they do not respect tourists.

(Original)
Les pires. En tant que Français j'avais réservé en ligne avec ma CB, tout allais niquel et pas cher. J'arrive pour prendre la voiture, on me dit que la CB n'est pas une carte de crédit donc je peux pas utiliser ma reservation. Ils me font prendre une nouvelle reservation directement sur place qui s'élève à juste 400$ de plus. avec une caution à 600$ (pour une semaine). En plus de m'être fait avoir, j'ai pas vraiment eu le choix (Jet lag, 13h d'avion dans les pattes) je voulais dormir. Bref a fuir tellement ils ne respectent pas les touristes.</review>
