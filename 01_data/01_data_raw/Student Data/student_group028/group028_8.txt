I decided to try it out again today and again my Frappuccino drinks were extremely watery with some ice chunks and a big blob of drizzle. I was going to ask for it remade but I was in a hurry for class. Service has been good but not the quality of the drinks made. It sucks since this Sbuck is in the plaza right across the street from my home. I rather drive to another.< /text>< Pictures>

Don’t really like the service! I have to say there’s other days I go and there’s kind people! But I just go in and order my drink and they are all like mad like if we did something and not as friendly.</Text>

Again I would be giving this particular starbucks 3 1/3* but there are no halves.
So here goes, starbucks is not my first choice for coffee.   I have found a coffee from starbucks that I absolutely have to have.  However they are by far the most convenient and I'm usually picking coffee for someone else so it just easier.   It's unfortunate that starbucks stop brewing their dark roast or French roast after a certain time as that pretty much all I drink but if I wait they will happily make it for me which I appreciate.  Aside from being convenient they are also consistent.  But what stands out at this location are the baristas that work there.  To say ppl friendly would be an understatement. And that is why I always choose to pick up coffee from this location. And unless the CS falls off a cliff(and it have to be a pretty long cliff) I will be returning.  Oh btw I have had ppl comment on how I sleep drinking such strong coffee so late in the a.m. or even afternoon.  Well my kids jokes that if I ever have a problem falling asleep, all i have to do is drink so coffee....<//text>

I come here not only because of the spacious environment, but more because of their service. Everyone knows you by your name especially if you're a regular. Eddie who is the manager, great genuine guy and knows how to keep the place clean. Prior to him managing the store was Josh who was also friendly and knew how to manage the staff as well. Recommend this place to anyone that values great customer service!< /Review>

Very nice Starbucks. The staff is friendly and you can count on consistent good cup of coffee at this location. It can get busy, and parking can be a challenge depending on the time of day.<//Review>

Good place for quick vietnamese sandwhich, I like BBQ pork with everything. They also sell drinks, soda, day old chocolate croissants, yummy, mini meat pies. Close to Evergreen library. ParkIng can get difficult and traffic can get sluggish therefore come early. Staff is friendly and make your food well. They accept credit cards.< /text>

<Text>Wait in line for 15 min in the morning. Ready to order a mocha....
"I'm sorry our espresso machine is down"
Ok, how long has it been down?
"It's been down for the last hour."
Ok, why didn't you tell me that before I waited in line for 15 min?

Seems like a nice place for certain situations, like getting together with friends, but not ideal for studying or working because the music is played very loudly. It was cleaner than the other Starbucks I’ve seen in San Jose.<//review>

My hair stylist was Marisela. I haven't been to a salon in over 10 years because I don't trust too many people with my hair, but I decided to give it a try and I'm super happy that I did. She was very knowledgeable and made me feel so comfortable. I was a little undecided on the exact color I wanted and didn't have a friend there for advice, but she was able to help me with that and I was so grateful she did because it came out perfectly. Couldn't have asked for a friendlier, knowledgeable and skillful stylist. I'm very pleased to say the least :)! Will definitely be going back.< /Text>

This salon never lets me down. The energy inside is always welcoming and bright. Any mistakes or inconveniences made (not that it happens often) they are always quick to make up for. The owner Anne is super sweet and so are the rest of the stylist. On top of all this my hair always comes out looking gorgeous. The color the cut is always what I ask for. ❤️ 10/10 recommend this salon< /Text>

I made a reservation for haircut and scalp treatment. The woman on the phone said they offered scalp treatments and even gave me details about it saying it was Japanese. Anyways when I get there there is no such thing, The receptionist booked me for a hair treatment when I asked for a scalp treatment making me believe i was indeed getting what I asked and wanted but she just decided to tell me it was a scalp treatment when it was not.
$60 dollars for 15 mins of just washing my hair and putting a treatment  was too expensive. The girl on the phone said the scalp treatment would last about an hour because it required a few steps.Glenda however was great and she listened to what I wanted. I loved the haircut she gave me. The receptionist didnt   need to lie about services they dont offer. Glenda was extremely nice and professional.  She was awesome.< /review>

The salon is bright and cheerful and right on 3rd in the heart of downtown. Hector, my stylist, is an artist with my men's medium long styling, working well with my thinning hair & MPB at the crown.</Review>

Sadly,  I didn't get to see if their work was any good or not. I had scheduled an appointment for four people and the owner, herself, canceled my blocked time because I didn't call to confirm.  I was told the stylist would call me to confirm.  The missunderstanding and apology didn't change the fact that two people came from north county for a day of pampering and it didn't happen.  Not the Saturday we expected.<//Text>

I came this morning for my appointment at 9am when I get there the receptionist informs me that it’s for the following week!! I made the appointment over the phone for at least a month ago and now to be told I didn’t have an appointment is upsetting.. This was going to be my first time at this salon, and now it will be my last!!! Never will I go to this salon ever again..<//Review>

1st, 2nd and 3rd of all, YES! Do yourself a favor and give this salon and their awesome team a try. I’m new to the area and tried their (super affordable) Groupon, from start to finish the staff was friendly and professional. Enrique is amazing! He listened attentively to my questions/concerns and gave me a beautiful haircut and style. They also offer nail services and have an eye brow threading lady - she is excellent! so I did not need to go somewhere else for that and saved a lot of time. Booking my next appointment with Enrique for a hair gloss asap!< /Review>

All i has to say is Magadel. She is amazing. Incredible service - listens to everything you say and somehow takes all of that feedback and makes you look like a million dollars. I won't let anyone else touch my hair every again.< /Review>

Love this salon! Friendly, professional customer service... they always greet you with a warm smile! Nice atmosphere with fabulous music playing in the background as you enjoy a beverage that's been offered to you, again with a smile.  My stylist, Michelle is fantastic! She helps keep my color in check, my highlights on schedule and my hair length proper all with the best attitude. I trust her completely and after my first visit with her (about a year ago) have pretty much let her  schedule the course of my hair appointments (in regard to the timing of color, highlighting  and cutting) up to her suggestion without interfering...I am that comfortable with her skill and knowledge of product! I always get compliments on my hair color ! Thank you Michelle and Shear Envy Salon!</review>

MAGADEL is amazing! Excellent service and very knowledgeable. She has a very flexible schedule. My hair has been brought back to life and I’m loving it. We’ve had fun playing with different colors, blues, purples, pinks and more recently balayage.< /text>

This place is amazing!! I've gone here consecutively for the past couple of years and every single time, they've give me great service. They provide you with recommendations for your specific hair type and help you make the right decisions for your look! They're very considerate and easy to get along with!! Both the staff and service is A+!! I've gotten lots of treatments done here (keratin, brazilian, etc.) as well as gotten my hair dyed here too! All of them turned out GREAT!< /Review>

<Text>This was my first time coming to this salon. I am more than pleased with the service and I will certainly be back! I have short hair and most places just trim around the edges and/or lack the ability to style.<//Text>< Pics>

I looked so fantastic when I left the salon, I had to party it up for two days! This guy is so sweet and cute. I WILL be back.</Review>< Pics>

I have been to this fine establishment several times. I’ve had multiple stylist do my hair and each time I have visited, the service was phenomenal. No matter who cut my hair, the results were excellent. They never failed to greet me with a warm welcome each visit. They feel like my second family. I will definitely comeback anytime anyone in my family needs their hair done.</Text>

Very welcoming and fun atmosphere. Michelle did my hair and she did wonders, I fell asleep while she washed my hair it felt great! All together I had my haircut, washed, styled and highlights and every step along the way she told me what she was doing and also gave me instructions on how to style. Everyone who works at Shear are relaxed and professional. I will continue to come back for all my hair needs!< /Review>

<Review>I went here to get my hair done for a wedding and it took the girl TWO hours to straighten my hair. My hair is not two hour long hair. A girl with hair to her waist came in, had her hair straightened, and left before me. My biggest issue is that my hair is naturally curly and whatever she put in it will not come out. It's been nearly two months and I cannot get my hair back to normal. It didn't even stay in the style she put it in for 30 minutes after leaving. I will NEVER go here again!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80d94dfd9bb09737:0xd9b082b0eca5a272<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Shear Envy is the bomb! As male with thick, curly hair, barber shops do not work for me. I've been getting hair cut here for over 1 year and Rebecca is skilled, thorough, and loves her career. I don't trust my hair with anyone else!

Plus they have water, mimosas, and comfy chairs in the waiting area! 🤘< /review>

<review>Talk about awkward. I was super excited to see they had a grouping after my first experience I couldn't wait to come back. When I did tho they said groupons were for first time customers only which apparently was in the super fine print. The owner wanted me to return the coupon and pay for the service. When I told her I couldn't because it was about to expire she honored it hesitantly. I do appreciate that they honored the coupon.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Review>Used a Groupon for a hair cut and deep conditioning treatment..staff were hospitable, but my end result was a nightmare. Cut off 5 inches of hair ( per my request). The next day, I washed my hair to remove the beautiful curls the stylist did for me when I discovered the WORST thing,  my hair cut was uneven!! Ended up going to another place and they had to cut another 2.5 inches to make my hair even. So upset.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<text>I visited the salon for the first time last week and absdolitely loved the atmosphere, staff and results. I will definetely return even though it's not very close to my home mostly because of the excellent customer service that I received while I was there. Kudos to the courteous staff, a great job from Rebecca on my hair and whoever came up with the chic and unique interior design.love it!

<Text>I had previously reviewed this salon but sadly when we had an issue I had to deleted it. Upon arrival at this salon they were very helpful and accommodating to what my daughter wanted done with her hair. One week later and $160 less in my pocket the dye had ALL come out of her hair. So I called the salon spoke to JP at that point he was helpful, it wasn't until I called back to set up an Appt for the re-do did the tone change. I was told they were not going to re-do her hair feee of charge because the two week period had past (I was NEVER told this). So I asked to speak to the owner, Anne she was not available but would be in at 4. So I called back at 4 to find now they were screening her calls and she wasn't available. I was giving a phony cell number to call her which I did with no return call. I've never given a business a one star rating until now. If you like to be lied to about how much a service will cost and have to pay more upon completion,  this is the salon for you. If you like to be lied to about correcting an issue and not correcting, this is the salon for you. If you like to watch the owner and her employees take selfies all afternoon while their customers watch on, this is the salon for you. Very disappointed in their salon,  customer service (rude employees) and have an owner not even return a phone call when there's an issue is not acceptable especially after the outrages' prices they charge after the fact.</Text><user_id>100684015760423052329< /user_id>< user_name>

<Review>THE MISSION: Significantly up MY hair game, and that of my 14-year-old daughter, too.

THE SITUATION: I’ve been a loyal customer to a “chain haircut” store (hint: rhymes with Man-tastic Pams) for my whole life.  We won’t get into how many decades that is… but it’s a while.  My daughter doesn’t ever do anything with her hair.  It’s long, thick and gets frizzy (she’s got 99 problems but volume isn’t one).

YELP TO THE RESCUE: Since we live in Chula Vista, we wanted to stay local and support the community.  Through Yelp I found Shear Envy.

THE SOLUTION: My daughter and I booked appointments and made our way to the salon.  I have to say 3rd Ave has really picked up since I was last there.  This salon is beautiful!  Great vibe and design.  Ashley gave my daughter and me a consultation and explained how a keratin treatment will take away the frizz.  Never heard of it, but my BFF, Google, said she was spot on.  So away they went.  Next up Martha came and gave me a really great haircut.  I’m not saying I’m George Clooney, but…  She gave me a cut that worked best with my hair.

THE RESULTS: You know how it’s impossible to replicate what the stylists do?  Well Martha not only cut my hair, she taught me how to wash and blow dry it, as well as how to style it and what products to use.  See you later, Dove, hello RandCo!  As for my daughter, OMG!  She now has silky hair and Ashley was super patient with her.

MOVING FORWARD: We definitely found our stylists and can’t wait to come back.  Thank you Shear Envy for helping us improve our hair.

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJD4VY9Wx_uI7KR_IsBW8fF_22xaT3F71SQDs9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPA-naZcgj1EZJPMyAuFzGBEmsm5evNSuIihsNy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80d94dfd9bb09737:0xd9b082b0eca5a272<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>I had a miserable experience!!!!!  After being there for 6 HOURS  for a partial foil and color underneath with a trim I left sobbing after sobbing in the chair for 2 hours. I went in with some decent regrowth but it was BLONDE. I left with gray hair!! The bleach was left on WAAAAAAAAY to long which I kept saying to the girl doing my hair. So since it was left on it is so over processed, brittle and disgusting now. They had to throw a toner on the highlights and it's still freaking gray and ashy instead of the blonde I wanted. How I went in with blonde hair and left with gray is beyond me. My hair now feels so dry and weak I'm afraid to even brush it and that's after they did a deep conditioning treatment to try to fix the mistake... I WILL NEVER RETURN and have advised my friends and family not to go there. After repeatedly telling the girl I was nervous with how long the bleach was left on she kept trying to convince me it was normal.... nope, nothing about this experience was normal. All I wanted was to have my hair look nice for when my baby was born for pictures and now I'm completely embarrassed to be seen. I didn't ask to look like a 70 year old woman!!! Even the manager said oh it's pretty light you're basically at silver.... I didn't ask for silver!!! I asked for light blonde!!!!! And it still cost me 125.00 for hair that I hate and will now have to pay a second time to get fixed which will have to wait until after my baby comes which means my hair will look like crap for the pictures we were planning!!!! So disappointed.  All I wanted was a nice relaxing me day before baby and it was a complete nightmare!!!!!!! I would not recommend this place if you want nice blonde highlights!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) They didn't really do what I asked, the person who attended me asked what I wanted and I ended up doing what he wanted and I was super damaged.

<Text>The beer is reslly expensive (think a good cocktail in a Manhattan hotel). But this is the only downside. Ambience and and food are good. As is the beer - except for the ransom they charge.</Text>< gmap_id>

<text>Very nice indoor and outdoor plaza for folks in San Jose to gather, eat and drink, and to watch games together. They always have plenty of dining options for you to choose from.
Minus one star because the turn over rate for these food stalls is fast. I am not sure why they don't last here, but that's not a good sign.< /text>< pics>

Food halls are a great invention. We love finding them when we travel. This one was great as usual.

We ate at Pizza Bocca Lupo, Konjoe Burger Bar, and Treatbot. All of it was delicious.

We loved being able to try a little bit of food from several places.

This hall was interesting because there were two different buildings separated by an outdoor patio. We loved the outdoor patio. It was the perfect place to enjoy our meal on a nice day.

We got there at 4 and not all of the vendors were open. The vendor list on the map was also out of date.

We were easily able to get parking right outside on the street. It's free on the street after 6 and $2/hr before that.

I'd highly recommend coming here for a meal while in San Jose!</text>

Top 3 things
1) Much smaller in real life than I expected.
2) We came here twice during our stay in San Jose. During the day, around 9:30am, not much was open and there were few people in the area.
3) We came back in the evening and there was much more going on. Several restaurants to choose from and a nice place for an evening walk.<//Review>

This is such an iconic and historical place that comes highly recommended to anyone who's in San Jose either for the very first time or revisiting after a very long time.

There are several stores along the street for anyone interested in shopping for souvenirs or just some daily essentials.

Please do watch out for teenagers who might be riding their skateboard at some scary speed.</review>

Visiting San Jose Downtown? Great. Coming to San Pedro Square? Even better.

With so many flavors to offer, San Pedro Square is just what you might need, once you're in SJ.

I got a chance to visit San Pedro Square last week with a group of friends. The best part is you get to choose out of many food options like Italian, Vietnamese, Japanese & Irish food joints and everything is just a walk away.

Use public transport or private vehicle without having to worry about parking. Multiple garages based at nearby locations.

PS- Downtown Farmer's Market every Friday (May-Nov) from 10-2.

One of the best places to grab food after work on San Jose. Full of various food vendors, bars, and a coffee shop there is something for everyone when you hang out with some friends down there. Also note there are multiple buildings so make sure to explore around</review>

San Pedro Square has something for everyone and for every budget.  It has dining, arts, entertainment, health and beauty salons, pubs and more. San Pedro Square hosts the San Jose Jazz Festival, Cinequest Film Festival, live music events, arts and music festival, and Tour of California cycling race.  There are nearly 1400 parking spaces at the Market-San Pedro Garage or parking along the streets.  There is so much to do and see here and worth a visit.</text>

The worst place to live worse than before I moved some of the people there are still there you cant hiking there anymore and what was the point in putting a solor system waiting more money and raising the rent on people who don't get paid enough who have kids in need this trailer needs new management cause now you have to pay 2 to $300 just to use the clubhouse they are kicking people out for no reason they told my mom that she was behind rent for 10 years lied through their teeth< /review>

I do not recommend at all. They are not professional. They hang up the phone on you.  They tell you come and pick up your car, it is ready, when in fact it is not, and we have to wait during COVID.  They are useless, use another Lexus service place< /review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Dont recommend. Basic service is 3x any nearby auto shop which maybe is justifiable if they provide upscale service, but they literally didn’t even wash my car after a $1.5k service. I asked if they could adjust my roof racks which i bought from a lexus dealership and they didn’t. They blamed covid on no car washing and I drove down the road to get a wash after i picked my car up. Total BS. They also called during the service to say it would be $500 more for random things they didn’t mention ahead. Called a firestone down the street and they said it was a rip off and they would do it for $150. Just generally can’t recommend this place. Poor value, poor service, all around.< /Text>< user>

<Review>I recommend going here if you feel like getting ripped off. I brought my leased Lexus in for the 25k mile tune up and oil change and they tried to charge me $1300 for service. I refused to pay that amount and in doing so found out that additional, unnecessary services were being added to my bill. I was able to get it down to $300. Then when my boyfriend went to pick up the car for me a few days later, the same man tried to charge him over 1k! Maracously, the bill dropped down to 500 then back to the original price that was agreed upon when I dropped off the car. I've always brought my car into the Woodland Hills service center and never experienced anything like what I experienced at Lexus of Beverly Hills. On top of it, my car wasn't washed like it always was at the Woodland Hills location. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this service center!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

First time here dissapointed called for a quote on an oil change they said $65 on the phone I figured it's for being a new customer I set an appointment arrive then they say it's $128 plus tax I knew it was too good to be true then I mentioned how they told me over the phone another price then they say oh that's if you get the full package of extra service which was not mentioned over the phone and not what I asked for just needed a simple oil change 🙄 couldn't even get a loaner car they said they don't offer them for just an oil change guess I didn't spend enough money for it. Lobby is small TV is off you just look out the window no complimentary water or coffee guessing due to covid this place is false advertisement they tell you one price then change it up 🙄< /review>

Really not pleased with the experience I had at Jim Falk Lexus of Beverly Hills. After over a week of email correspondence to try and find myself a car, I finally scheduled a meeting with the lady I had been emailing to test drive and crunch the numbers for my options. We had to wait 15 minutes for her to finally come and greet us in the showroom and another 20 minutes while she "spoke to her boss" (she was in the corner of the room visibly not speaking to anyone).

After telling her of another appointment we had, I asked her to please email me all of the options we were discussing along with the photos of the vehicles, the specs, and all final pricing. She agreed to do so before end of day... I never heard from her. I also reached out via email a day later to check in and have still yet to hear from her.

Needless to say, I'll be taking my business to another dealership.

UPDATE: I called the dealership to express my grievances and had the most disrespectful and tasteless conversation with their manager, Mary. She told me they had no proof of my follow up email, that we were rude, and not serious about our purchase. Not only do I have proof of the email, I offered to forward it to her. I expressed how my interest in the Lexus diminished only after the  service we experienced. I am absolutely appalled with the disregard for people's time.< /Review>

Brought the IS 350 F sport at Jim Falks. Came here on July 7, 2020; noise came from my rear tires loose backing plate, got a rental and everything. Got the car back on July 9, 2020 with success, but I got home and realized my dash cam doesn’t work I noticed the power plug was in the radar socket and the usb cord was unplugged. The dash cam shouldn’t have been touched since I brought the car for rear tire problems. I have video evidence that shows my dash cam worked during the warranty work and stopped working on July 8, 2020 17:06:20 this was when the technician (Hector) took my car for an overnight test drive. I talked to the Service Manager (Josh Kim) showed him the evidence about the problem on 7/10/2020 and he told the service representative (Caneen) to tell me to get a diagnostics on the problem from where I had gotten the dash cam installed. Really? You broke it and your going to tell a customer to get a diagnostics on the problem!? Don’t ever bring your car in here unless you want bad service! I expected everything to be fixed and stayed the same, who expects a problem to be fixed and cause another problem?? But they denied any responsibility. I also came back on 7/132020 to see if the Service director (D. Vinci) could help me out but it was the same outcome. He said “how do I not know it broke when you took the car home” uhh because there’s a time stamp that shows the last time the dash cam worked duh... I am really stressed out especially because of the pandemic but your going to add more on top of that? I’ve never been to a service center this out of place and unprofessional, how does a multi billion dollar company like Jim Falks be so lacking?
Let me tell you how much dash cam works- Video is triggered by any kind of force for example( car crash or just closing the door) the camera is never turned off it has an internal battery that records motion so if anyone comes within range it records! So if anyone messes with my car I will know and it saves to a SD CARD!!
Update: Brought a diagnosis of the problem on 7/20/20 to Dominic Vinici the guy doesn’t believe me after I showed him the evidence. Is he acting dumb? Or is the company doing that bad that they can’t pay for their mistake? I really don’t know. All I want is JIM FALK OF BEVERLY HILLS to take responsibility for their actions and to stop wasting my time!!< /review>

If you are afraid of the price, tell them you only need certain services and you’ll take care of others later. They respect your decision. No push!<//review><user_id>104257802122822400584< /user_id>< GmapID>

<Review>Horrible customer service. I called before 9 am for a quote. All I needed was one sentence email on the cost for a service. Martha Gomez promised me to send me an email shortly. I waited for a whole day, called them 3 times without any result! Highly recommended to avoid this place!<//Review>< pictures>

I can’t stress how disappointed I am with this group. I sent my mom in to them because I trusted the Lexus brand but clearly Jim Falk does not operate with integrity. She replaced her two front tires through another company one week prior to coming to them. She hit a pot hole and unfortunately had to replace one of the new tires. The service consultant advised that they would not (per this stores policy) replace only one tire and said she needed to purchase two brand new tires. Totaling $760! Then they proceeded to tell her she “needed an alignment” and charged an additional $260 for that $99 for nitrous and a warranty (that has always been provided from every other Lexus dealer I have bought tires from for free.) My mom trusted that she was in good hands and needed all these items. She explained that this was a cost she wasn’t prepared to pay for twice in under two weeks and the service consultant preyed on her and took advantage of the situation.

Worse than that, when I spoke with the Service manager Eric, he stated she signed for it and that all they would do is give a $200 “store credit.” He had no sympathy for an older woman and couldn’t be bothered to help rectify the situation. When I said I was going to reach out to Lexus directly, he said “it didn’t matter because he was the one who had the power to do something about it. “

If you need service, try Lexus of Glendale.<//review>

I can’t stress how disappointed I am with this group. I sent my mom in to them because I trusted the Lexus brand but clearly Jim Falk does not operate with integrity. She replaced her two front tires through another company one week prior to coming to them. She hit a pot hole and unfortunately had to replace one of the new tires. The service consultant advised that they would not (per this stores policy) replace only one tire and said she needed to purchase two brand new tires. Totaling $760! Then they proceeded to tell her she “needed an alignment” and charged an additional $260 for that $99 for nitrous and a warranty (that has always been provided from every other Lexus dealer I have bought tires from for free.) My mom trusted that she was in good hands and needed all these items. She explained that this was a cost she wasn’t prepared to pay for twice in under two weeks and the service consultant preyed on her and took advantage of the situation.

Worse than that, when I spoke with the Service manager Eric, he stated she signed for it and that all they would do is give a $200 “store credit.” He had no sympathy for an older woman and couldn’t be bothered to help rectify the situation. When I said I was going to reach out to Lexus directly, he said “it didn’t matter because he was the one who had the power to do something about it. “

If you need service, try Lexus of Glendale.</text>

<review>Extremely unprofessional and no sense of urgency!! My perception was no one wanted to work and every was ready with same excuse “we are busy.” I have noticed they treat you depending on race, ethnicity, and what car you drive. Very disappointed in their service!! I had more expectations from Beverly Hills Lexus! Never coming back to this service location again.

Just wanted to take the time to give my appreciation to Freddy Hall. It has been a pleasure working with him as my service advisor! I’ve worked with other advisors in this service department, as well as other dealerships, and have not come across such great customer service as I have with Freddy. He is extremely attentive and persistent in solving any complex or ongoing problems. He‘s extremely honest and made sure my vehicle was well taken care of. Always kept me in the loop and made sure I was up to date with the progress of my vehicle.

The receptionist girls are also great! They always have fresh cookies ready and greet you with a smile (:

I would highly recommend Jim Faulk Lexus of Beverly Hills and request Freddy as your service advisor!</review>

No one welcomes you when you arrive in the front lot AND upon entering the building. Mr Hall assisted me though I’m not satisfied. I guess the staff are used to rich customers and looks suspicious when you look regular or when someone’s wearing shorts and shirt only. I was promised the car service will take around 2hours  but after 5 hours I called and Hall said its ready so  I hurried back to the center and was disappointed because my car is still at the parking lot looking dusty and dirty. I was quickly carwashed  but upon closer inspection it’s still dirty from inside out.   So not so Beverly Hills -quality service.<//text>

The staff here is phenomenal! From the service staff, to the receptionist staff, to the Valet and the rest, I don't have a single negative thing to say. If you get Freddy Hall, get ready for a rainy day turned into sunshine. This guy is ON it when it comes to your car, and while you wait, it would be unbelievable if you left him without a burst of laughter, or at least a smile. The best Lexus service location in LA.</text>

Raul Bohorquenz did his best to make our experience bad.

First with trying to charge us a $200 fee for wheel alignment that we didn't need (brand new car under warranty and rim/wheel manufacturer insurance).

Second, trying to charge us a $200 diagnostic fee to check a wheel noise that they attempted to fix before and acknowledged it was under their responsibility.

Third, telling us there are no loaner cars available even though they promised us twice there will be, and literally 5 seconds after a different lady said they do have.

Lastly, after claiming there is no problem with giving us a car wash (after being promised by the previous representative) he changed his mind, saying they don't do so and the previous rep declined the promise I alleged. I saw the previous rep there and he claimed he can totally do that, confirming the promise.

Stay away from Raul, even after I shared with him the fact that it looked like he is doing his best to make my experience bad, he acted as a stonewall thinking that he is not doing anything wrong.<//text>

Fast service.. service advisor was a little condescending when discussing needed repairs over the phone. He actually said "I don't want to waste your time or mine" before getting into the details. Last I checked, it's your job to inform the client, and in a positive manner. I expect decent customer service from a Lexus service center.  Hopefully,  my experience is isolated,  because of this I will go elsewhere for needed repairs.

Side note: You are required to replenish gas used in the loaner cars, which was never the case with other Lexus service centers I've used (in Texas and Florida).< /review>

<review>This is my current situation with your service department.

Back in January of 2017,  I had to replace a clamp that held my driver's side airbag in place.  First of all, I have never seen a "loose" airbag.  Second, its a $60,000 dollar car.  Shouldn't have little issues like this for a luxury brand marketed as such.  The second issue I had back in January 2017 was a rattling noise throughout the vehicle and at that time I was informed that the sunroof was loose and had to be fixed which it was.  Now comes this past week.  The same issue with the airbag.  The clamp was installed improperly and now I have to pay for something that #1 that you couldn't assemble correctly in the 1st place and #2 you couldn't fix correctly and #3 now I am asked to pay for it.  So let me get this straight.  You made a faulty assembly and also "fixed" the issue incorrectly and now you will charge me $300 dollars for things you couldn't get right?  I am puzzled what you are trying to pull here.  Of course there is a "full" vehicle inspection so that you can do a little work with parts and have me pay for HOURS for labor totaling $1,000.  Why in the world would I ever service my vehicle in your service department when you cant even put a clamp on an airbag?  How can I have the EXACT same issue for an issue that you have claimed to fix?

Here is another issue.  If your front line associates cannot answer a client's question due to the fact that a manager's decision may be involved, have the manager call.  My service rep Leo Kim, who is FANTASTIC by-the-way, is calling me multiple times a day to get a question answered by his manager Josh Kim.  Oh, if the manager just called and I asked him the questions to him directly, we wouldn't have wasted our time with 3 phone calls.  This is a triple capacity issue for you and I.  You have an associate who is going back and forth trying to get answers for his client and going the manager and  then calling me and I have a follow-up question and then he goes back to the manager AGAIN and then calls me and then I have ANOTHER follow-up questions and then he goes that to the manager AGAIN and the calls me back.  I mean, C'MON!!!  Absolutely ABSURD!!  The airbag is a safety issue and god forbid if something happens and that airbag either pops prematurely OR does not pop at all, you might have worse issues at hand than fixing a clamp.

I cannot stand your service department.  When I was in the dealer in January of 2017, you know that one of your service managers in the front blatantly lied to my face and stated that if I do not service the car in your dealer that the warranty will be forfeited?  UNBELIEVABLE.

I am looking to purchase a car June of next year.  I bought my 1st Lexus in 2009 and bought my next Lexus in 2013 AND I referred a friend to buy a Lexus in November of 2017.  I paid off my GS350 in about 2 years and definitely have resources to do even better.  Well you can kiss all that goodbye.  I am going to absolutely take Lexus off my list of cars for my next purchase.  This is California, the car mecca of the world.  I have plenty of choices to purchase a car that costs more than some homes in the U.S.  My father just purchased a Benz and frankly they blew you out of the water in not only sales but initial servicing.

Absolute Disaster in the servicing department.  AGAIN and AGAIN.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>The service is excellent, so are the receptionists. I was surprised to find out that lot of expensive items of routine 25k service was not covered even though I had prepaid service for 4 years when I leased the car.

Spent over $100 on a piece of plastic to mount front license plate only to have it improperly installed. The screws are stripped, one is crooked and bent and the mount is not flush with the bumper.

The nervous young man struggled and struggled until he was finally rescued by another mechanic just before the screws were 100% stripped. Get the kid some training before you put a DeWalt screw gun in his hands and having him drilling into the front of $50,000 + automobiles. I should of stuck to my original plan and gone to Home Depot and bought 2 screws...<//text>

<Review>Just wanted to thank Jimmy and his team. I called a few days in a row and asked 20 questions about lowering my GMC. Jimmy explained the pros and cons of my options and I was comfortable with my decision. As I never leave my opinion because its just an opinion I felt I had to. My experience was smooth and the outcome was exactly what I asked for.
Thanks again Jimmy< /Review>< Pics>

<review>I came here about a month ago to get front suspension work and brakes for my Acura TSX. They offer easy financing if needed and they do a great job. I came back today and they helped me out quickly and reliable as always. The staff is very helpful and respectful.I highly recommend them.</review>< Pictures>

Big scam and liars!
Stay away from this place. I went to them because they were close to my location. I was hoping to put new rims and tires and have the factory set removed. They Made me waste my time and money!  The rims and tires didn’t fit on my car after getting a lift. I thought they were professional to tell me that they wouldn’t fit before they did anything to my car. After all they charged me again to have them removed. Do not go there they will lie to you and take advantage in any way to get money from you.<//Text>

1100 bucks for 4 struts change plus labor was the quote. I mean this is a pretty margin padded quote. This is the kind of place that unless you're friends with these guys, you'll get ripped off.</review>

Been going to them for years. This place is very honest and helpful when you are stressed due to flat tires. Comprehensive pricing when needing to purchase new tires. I won't go anywhere else.<//Review>

I have being customer of Express tires in Lynwood for a long time, I always find the best quality and the best price, I always window shopping before I make my final decision and Express Tires always come out winner 10 out of 10. fast service warranty on their jobs. I don't get why they will get any bad reviews. I think those are haters LOL. I guarantee you go with Express Tires and you  become a loyal customer.< /review>

This place can hook you up with the good prices and if they make a mistake they'll always correct it, they are very nice and treat you very nicely. If you take your car for a tire change they finish in 30 minutes or less.< /review>

(Translated by Google) The worst place What I visited for an alignment .. They charged me for the alignment of my car And they only did inspection .. and very bad service by the owners who do not know how to treat their clients ..
When I spoke to claim them They even got upset and hung up Why could not you give me a justification

We are a business and we combine for our services just like a doctor charges your query. We have been serving the community for over 22 years. Giving fair prices and good service. But we can not give away our services.\n\n(Original)\nJose el servicio ke uste pidio fue una inspecion computarizada para presentanle a su aseguranza.

One of the best all-time espresso drinks I've had I drank at Tribu Cafe this morning. A double 12 oz latte, to be exact. When I asked for a second one the barista told me the organic espresso roast beans he uses are strong enough that a single should do...but I was already hooked on the strength and depth of the double. He complied with a smile. Great bagel and cream cheese, look forward to sampling the menu further. But go just for the 5 star espresso! You won't regret it.</review>

Traditionally empty spot near Paradise cafe. Hoped for more reasonable pricing and friendly service. Got the friendly half. Ordered acai bowl turned out to be $11 smoothie placed in a bowl, I call it acai soup - still tastyish. High quality contrast with paradise cafe, but I hope they survive Paradise taking over that neighborhood. Check out Dee Spot down the block, hidden but good.<//review>

Excellent sandwiches that all come with a delicious fresh green salad perfectly dressed with a scrumptious vinegrette.  Great lattes too. Excellent and friendly service.  Especially good, for me, is the dog-friendly patio out front.<//Review>

The person at the cashier was very friendly and helpful - they ran out of the breads I would've preferred for my sandwich (I learned after ordering), and the cashier/server threw in a slice of cake as a consolation.

I would've returned even if they hadn't done that, because the sandwich and salad were very tasty.<//review>< GmapID>

We had good sandwiches here. The coffee was so-so.  A fair number of choices on the menu.  San Pablo avenue, though, is a constant presence, and that's not a good thing.  Good choice for a quick meal if you're in the area.<//Text>

Try the focaccia tuna sandwich! It’s sooo good. Go with salad instead of chips. The chips and salsa don’t pair too well with it BUT the salsa was delicious. Salsa side tasted roasted and home made. Four stars because it’s the only thing I’ve tried there, yet.<//text>

<text>Mediocre. Out of the bowls and smoothies tried I was unimpressed. Portion sizes large. Good on them for not dumping tons of sugar/salt on things.< /text>< GmapID>

Awesome place for working -- plenty of table space and outlets. Owner is friendly and food and drink prices are reasonable.</text>

This place is severely underrated. whenever I come in, it's empty, but that's to my advantage. I love coming here for breakfast to get my breakfast burrito fix. they also do a good cubano. I'm an americano kind of girl so I always order that too without disappointment! I prefer the coffee here over Farleys and Actual Cafe, both of which are just around the corner.<//Review>

Too too expensive and rather shabby compared to other rextaurants in the area. How do they stay in business?</Text>

<username>Harry Chan<//username><text>A good little gym with plenty of bouldering and some top rope including a few autobelays. $17 day pass. The settings and ratings are pretty good and accurate relative to many of the Bay Area gyms. The top rope walls aren’t too tall, but the space is utilized well. I spent over 2 hours here and wasn’t bored.

I got in soon after it opened on a Saturday and the bouldering area filled up quick but it wasn’t crazy. Friendly folks of varying skill. Both staff and climbers were all friendly and chill.

This is a good gym for Santa Barbara. I would sign up for a membership if I lived out here.

It would be cool if they expand into a bigger place one day!</text><time>1553992815754< /time></record>

<Review>Was up there for a Collegiate Competition. They started an hour late, super disorganized. People were cutting, hogging, etc. Really small gym for such a big event, there must've been at least 80 climbers on the bouldering side (which is 4 walls).Didn't try top roping or lead, but the walls are so short for that, definitely should've been an all bouldering gym, it would be more spacious. The setting was not great either. Maybe wouldn't be too bad on a normal day, but that event was hectic, and not worth it. I do have to say the staff was super nice and friendly though, which is a huge plus. Overall, wouldn't  recommend that gym, much rather climb outdoors in SB.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80e9138859bbc057:0xabc23c9500b93d36</Gmap_id></record>

Very fun place to climb. Little children to seniors, beginners to experts, all are made to feel welcome. Friendly attentive staff are serious about safety. Top rope and bouldering routes are set up for all skill levels and are changed regularly so there are always new challenges. I look forward to my weekly visits there with my teenage and adult children. This is a fun place to take visitors from out of town with plenty of close by restaurants and shops.<//review>

<UserId.>114373221713555740848<//UserId.><time>1538172250992< /time><text>My favorite rock gym on the west coast. I’m not the most experienced climber, nor have I been to a great many of the rock gyms in the world. But, out of all of those I’ve been to I’d say that SBRG is a clear winner.

The climbs are well balanced, and have a good grading in difficulty.

The VFun grade is unique to SBRG as far as I can tell, but it is one of the things they do really well. The VFuns challenge beginners by introducing new techniques on a variety of (easy) problems, while giving the more experienced climbers a great way to warmup or climb down from more challenging problems.

The staff is helpful and friendly.

My only complaint is that the gym is a little small. I’d like them to expand, but this is wishful thinking, and probably very expensive.

If you’re stopping in while traveling, you could try to land it on a Tuesday, when it’s buy one get one free day passes, but this is the busiest it gets in my experience.

Happy climbing!<//text><Response>{'time': 1550509585545, 'text': "Justin, it's fantastic to hear we're your favorite rock gym on the West Coast!

< Review>
Kind of old and dusty. Routes not very technical, just finger strength. Old, slippy holds. Very high density of routes, hard to see the line.
But unfortunately the only you can get within 60minutes of driving

Edit: Gave it a 2nd try today, still sucks. The walls are packed with holds, its impossible to climb without hitting other holds or without taking a break in the middle of the climb to find all holds. Colors don't match. The fact that they need tape to mark the route speaks for itself.

Can not understand why other visitors rate it so good, thats the worst climbing gym I have been in and I climb since 25years.<//Review>

It was okay, i think i would have been better off bouldering. Im not sure if it was the SNL hipster dude that turned me off to this gym but it feels like a place you go when it rains in sb and thats not often. Good idea not like the gyms in the rocky mountains but hey. You get the feeling the people here have been on a mountain. Great place to dump the kids for an afternoon. But as an adult I probably wont be back.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) It is good to take indoor rock climbing lessons and practice while traveling. Pay per class. There is no special training, but I kindly teach you things to know. After that, you can cut off the day pass and practice by watching other people play alone. Shoes and gears can also be borrowed at the gym. There's a lock locker that you can use for free, you can drink water, and ... just bring a bucket.

여행 중에도 실내 암벽 등반 수업을 듣고 연습하기 좋다. 수업 당 페이를 하면 된다. 특별히 맹 훈련을 시키거나 하진 않지만 꼭 알아두어야 할 것들을 친절하게 잘 가르쳐준다. 이후에는 데이패스를 끊어 혼자 주구장창 다른 사람들이 하는 걸 보면서 연습하면 된다. 신발이나 기어들도 체육관에서 빌릴 수 있다. 무료로 쓸 수 있는 잠금 로커도 있고 물도 먹을 수 있고... 물통만 가져오면 된다.<//Text>

<review>The service was trash in this place. For the price that they charge for hats, you would think that they would treat their customers better. Instead the guy that was there, showed me a couple of hats, then someone else walked in, he left me alone and went over to help them. Mind you I was waiting there for 10 minutes smh.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

This review is specifically for the guy who was working the desk at the shop a month or so back. I just came in to get my hat brim fixed and he was beyond helpful! He had a few tricks for me and also styled my hat! I haven't bought anything from the store yet but I plan to now because clearly they have great people working for them!</review>

<Text>I visited and now have an excellent new hat. I didn't think I needed a new hat either. Black, flat and sophisticated - super. Am looking forward to the colder weather to get the best. Charming service and good advice.

My brother's father in-law runs an exclusive hat club and my wife and I were lucky enough to be initiated as a member. Goorin Bros are the official hat providers for the club. There hats are amazing. They are pricey but worth it in quality. I definitely feel much classier wearing one of their hats.<//review>

We went to stretch a hat we had previously bought. They were very kind and amenable! Will definitely go back whenever we can.< /Review>

<text>Every goorin bros I've been to (all 3 in SF and 1 in LA on Melrose) have had great customer service. I dont care if there are other stores with less expensive products or even better looking hats (which I doubt). Great customer service brings me back every time.</text>< time>

This is actually the flagship store for Goorin and quite large. The staff there are incredibly helpful and not pushy at all. I honestly think they just love hats and don't care if you are trying to get a feel, after all you have to find the right hat, right? The hats themselves are of different qualities, but if you want the best, then make sure to grab something from the heritage line!<//review>

<review>This hat shop makes it difficult to buy hats anywhere else. They make great products for the trend setting hipster, chic fashionista, bowling paps, burning man festival lover, and all those in between. Definitely great hat accessory options to select from; pins, feathers, and belts. There are a few locations in SF and the North Beach shop has the largest selection. They carry a larger variety from what you see available online. Inventory changes a few times a year so buy it if you like it because it will probably be gone.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808580f10fd5399d:0x92004adb1356fd27< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>"You wear the hat, the hat doesn't wear you!" Tall Tara replied to my "I don't look good in hats, I just love the style." I go into almost every hat shop I come across but this day was different. That statement stuck with me as Tall Tara passed me hat after hat telling me to keep trying them on and see which one didn't look as bad as others and soon I started to see things different. This one didn't look as funny as that one and before long I was holding on to one or two that looked OK on me and then I found THE ONE. I don't buy junk so I was in the right place. You can tell this is a quality work of art. I was ready but one problem, I wanted black. Tall Tara checked and checked but couldn't find one around any of the near by shops. "Wait... you said you are from Seattle?" One last call to their store in Seattle and my new hat was on it's way to my house to meet me when I returned. A quick care and tips session from Tall Tara and I was out the door with a smile on my face and a strong desire to get home to my new hat. Years of walking into hat shops and walking out disappointed I didn't look good in anything... but now because of Tall Tara... I wear the hat, the hat doesn't wear me!</Review>< pics>

Went there to buy a hat and found myself on Thursday happy hour starting at 7 p.m.. Live jazz free lager in the bottle and I bought 3 hats to go. Great experience and staff was youthful knowledgeable and friendly. I'll post a picture or two of the Jazz Ensemble.< /Review>

Apart from the fact their hats are superior, the staff are brilliant too. Have bought hats here and at Goorin Bros in New Orleans and and will do so again on my return. Tonnes of styles, all high quality, and extremely helpful staff.</Review>

90% of these hats are not made in the US and come from overseas. $45 for a hat that cost someone $4 to make, if that. If you do find a good hat, it's too expensive. Do yourself a favor and go to Berkeley Hat Company on Telegraph Ave. Killer hats of all makes Stetson, Mayser, Dobbs, etc., and, cheaper than anyone else. Staff is a little eccentric, but hey, it's Berkeley. Carry lots of classics, not passing fads that try and pass for a brim worn by most 16 year olds or community college wannabes wearing skinny jeans walking down the street and smoking cloves. Scope it out!</Review>

<text>Goorin Brothers Hat Shop keeps with the traditional craftsmanship and details of the old world hat shops for generations, but uses modern sizing, a variety of fabrics and styles to really keep things both where they should be and point to where we're going.

Maybe it's because I own a slew of Pendletons, but somehow I purchased a Tribly that perfectly matches a Vintage Pendleton I own. Not only the material, but the accenting piece. It wasn't your traditional wool which almost every traditional hat was made from, but the seams and sewing really helped the hat keep shape. Some friends I went here with also bought a straw Tribly and a few other styles. Granted I haven't been to the other Goorin Brothers shops, the design of the shop reminded me of 5 & a Dime in SD, ironically near where they are opening a new shop in San Diego. More of a library style shelving with intricate dark stained wood and mirrors with hardwood floors and a loft above the front register. Tall ceilings and since I went in the first month or so they were really trying to move inventory to make room for new models.

I bought a can of the Raindri which is manufactured specifically for Goorin Brothers shops is similar to scotch guard, but designed specifically for fabrics and items designed to be dry clean only. Unlike many other weather guards this does not stain, so there is no need for color safing. Unlike many other's this is aerosol and mists the best because it's often designed to cling to all the many fibers of wool.

The staff is great, not pushy at all. I knew I wanted to buy, but I felt them out and realized they suggested based on me not being a Joe Schmo off the street wanting a Fedora, yet knowing the difference between that and a Trilby.

If I didn't use so much Suavecito Pomade product in my hair and spend so much time looking clean I'd wear more hats and I'd buy them from Goorin Brothers. Can't wait for the SD shop to open at the old Vans location. It could be the trifecta of getting a traditional haircut and straight razor shave at Lefty's, walking to 5 & A Dime and getting crisp clothing and then walking to Goorin to finish the look and your ready for anything.<//text>< user_id>

(Translated by Google) A hat shop that happened to drop in by the street. The hat is the main, but there are also caps and hunting. I liked hunting and bought impulses.

Be careful be mindful purchasing from here. They will give you a car, even with no money down. But is it a good car? And when you are less than 2,000 paid off will the really let you do a trade in? Nope.< /text>

I had bad credit from medical bills and no co-signer, I lost my car and was broke when I found CarHop. They helped me get a car in literally a day and were so sweet and helpful. Their customers are all very nice and I’ve heard nothing but good things from this place. Highly recommend ❤️<//Review>

Company is a scam, their payment records don’t match your banks, accounts won’t be correct with notes nor records of conversations, Reps Barely know what they are doing and have no customer service experience. My car had a cracked oil pan and bad engine that had to be fixed after being told it just had a 100 point inspection, after buying the car I was told to get the keys I had to give them a 5 star rating which the lady did on my phone not me. Company is a joke. Will be filling a suit with BBB</Text>

Just want to thank Megan at the Car Hop in Hayward for making my purchase experience a great one and helping me feel confident in my choice of vehicle. Megan knows how to pop things off and make you feel welcome she also knows how to make your visit less stressful. Thanks Megan you are the best.

If Y’all Need A Car and You Can’t Find any dealership to get approved then Go See My Friend Alex at Carhop! He’s a Life Saver!! He helped me get approved today so that me and my daughter won’t be on the bus no more! I am very happy with the car he helped me get today and recommend anyone who has credit issues to come ask for Alex at Carhop! Thanks Again 😊😊😊😊<//Review>

This place has great customer service. I worked with Megan Walton and from the moment I came in until the very end of me getting ready to leave she has been a great help. Carhop is the best place to get rather new or old cars at reasonable prices. I will be coming back again.<//text>

Congrats on your new vehicle and thanks for your business!'}<//Response><text>Came in to CarHop not really knowing what to expect but Alex Urbina was super helpful and understanding of my situation and how valuable my time was. Even though I wasn’t able to leave with a car the same day (mainly because I needed my wife’s approval) Alex kept me in the loop and valued my time and suggested the appropriate plan of action. I came back the next day and with all details ironed out before hand I was able to come in, do one last test drive and get going with the car buying process. Entire process took about an hour which worked out great. Thanks Alex for your patience and understanding and thank you CarHop for giving me an opportunity to work more on my credit.<//text><rating>5</rating><user_name>Luis Zaranda</user_name><Date>1571335417286<//Date><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

Today was a good day... I came in super nervous about getting my first car, however Alex made me feel super comfortable. It was definitely a faster process  than I expected. I drove off the same day with my car “Gracie” yep I named her already!!!! Thanks Alex<//review>

I have been trying so hard to buy an affordable car since buying a lemon off craigslist! I have not been successful but just when I was about to give up, I was told about carhop! That information changed my life! I got a phone call from Alex one of the sales consultants there asking me to come in. He let me know that he would try his best to help me get another car! Boy am I glad I did Alex just wanted  to help me get out my situation and found me the best car. He was great and provided the best customer service experience for me. I will never forget this day he changed everything. Go to carhop if you need a reliable means of transportation ask for Alex U.😁😀😁😀</Text>

<Text>Do not recommend shopping with them because something is always wrong with my vehicle and they have had no compassion during the pandemic threatened to take my car over a 20$ payment they didn’t receive they offer no leniency and the collection people call you everyday even on holidays I am 1,000$ away from paying my car off and I’m so glad I will never purchase a car from this company ever again

I highly would recommend carhop if you had trouble in the past with getting a vehicle. Meagan is that employee who would always go beyond what she needs to do to help out any customer.

After dealing with them for over a year, I would suggest going elsewhere to finance a car. This place is a scam. They commit fraud and their website is vague. DO NOT WORK WITH THESE PEOPLE. There are legitimate companies you can go through especially if you need a vehicle in a bind. NOT this one!</text>

They were really helpful on making me drive off the lot with a vehicle.They try their hardest & work with you if you're not picky & good or bad credit. I drove off the lot in a 2005 Chrysler 300 limited & they only asked for 500$ down. I recommend going to CarHop in Hayward or any CarHop. And the lady that helped me get my vehicle was Megan.</Text>

<Text>I went in today and got helped by Derrick Bryant and he was AMAZING! Super polite and nice. Was understanding when I had to walk around the office with my 1 year old son and even talked with him. Derrick answered all my questions and totally put me at ease about my decision to go to car hop. He literally made the experience I was DREADING into an easy and smooth process! Thank you so much Derrick! I look forward to dealing with him in the future when I come back for my second car!<//Text>< pics>

Alex at this location was the best ! I got my DREAM car! And didn’t even need a co signer even thought I have NO CREDIT , like no bad credit , or low, absolute NONE and he still managed to get them to finance me! He’s the sweetest and when I come to trade it or bring someone we would exclusively go to him</review>

So I called several times prior to spending $40 on a lyft ONE WAY to this location and asked if my application could be done prior to wasting money and time commuting over an hour away. I was advised no i HAD TO come inside. I asked if they do in house financing because I know my credit score and I know I have poor credit. I was advised yes. I was asked to provide all of my personal to have my credit ran for them to tell me they couldn’t provide a vehicle or tell me the reason why to wait on a letter. Staff was more busy being chatty then being helpful. I guess since I had the last appointment of the day priority was out the window as well as professionalism and customer service. Was a very rushed out the door situation. If you’re going to be denied for credit anywhere. Pick a better place. Good luck :-)</text>

Went into car hop for a trade in.
Homeboy salesman Alex Ubrina hooked me up with a car that fits my criteria. Got me a low price simple and fast.

I had a great experience here at the Hayward location! Kristopher is Awesome! Super kind and made the entire process so simple and made sure I was comfortable with my decision! A great place to go if you’re like myself and need a car soon and don’t have great credit.  Hands down an overall good experience and highly recommended!!!<//text>

Car hop is a great place to come and get a car. The sales rep Alejandro here customer service was perfect. He found me the best car that suits me. And found me a very great deal on the vehicle. I felt very blessed by that. I will be coming here for future reference for another vehicle. Car hop is the place to go no doubt!!!!!<//Text>

Came in today with low expectations but nonetheless came in with my sister and she left with a new car! Got awesome customer service from the salesmen Alex today. He provided great customer service and went above and beyond to get my sister driving today with little money down! I would highly recommend yhall go see Alex or Megan to get driving right away and highly recommend Car Hop!<//Review>

Bought my car today and Alex Urbina was the one to help me purchase. His customer service and patience with working with me to be able to walk out today with a car was amazing. The staff over all was very welcoming and pleasant. They went over and beyond to help me make my payment possible and here I am with my car today. I recommend anyone whose interested in purchasing a card. This branch was overall amazing to work with. Thanks Alex 😁</Review>

Alex did great, really transparent and helped me out with my situation. Only reason not 5-stars is due to the wait time so if you have somewhere to be I don't recommend just "stopping in". Make some time and you'll come out happy!<//Text>

I appreciate the staff at Car Hop. I walked in this afternoon frustrated from my first experience, and Ms. Megan helped me. She got me into a better car, at a lower interest rate, and lower monthly payments. She was friendly, courteous, professional, and patient while she answered all of my questions, and made sure that I was fully satisfied with the process of the trade in, and the new car I received. I also appreciate the assistant manager, Derek, who kept my children entertained during the entire process, even staying open after hours, to assist me with this purchase for my family.< /text>

<review>First off I would like to thank Alex Urbina the sales associate who assisted me during this wonderful easy process getting me back in a car and on the road! Alex was awesome, very professional and went down every avenue to make sure I was taken care of... it’s been an up and down two years with a job and no car because no one else would give me a fair shot. But today is a new day and from this day forward I will be driving and I thank the Hayward team as a whole and especially Alex for making this possible! Carhop ROCKS!<//review><Rate>5</Rate>< userid>

<Review>Great place! We have 2 cars from here! Great service as well! That’s what I thought until I bought a Malibu and it had electrical problem that they were told about and they STILL weren’t working with me and still wanted payments . NO ONE we brought it too could fix it and they still refused to help us and the shops said it was a problem for more than the 3 months we had it. They are rude and you’ll get played if you buy from them. Go to a dealership they run the same credit check. I learned this from experience. Now I drive a brand new 2020!</Review>< Pics>

I had a great experience since first walking through the door. Megan was a big help, from doing all that she could to get me approved to getting me an exceptional vehicle to go home with. She worked with me step by step to make sure everything met my needs, and i appreciate her for it. I would recommend hayward carhop to anyone in need of a vehicle.<//Review>

< Review>
I appreciate the staff at Car Hop. I walked in this afternoon frustrated from my first experience, and Ms. Megan helped me. She got me into a better car, at a lower interest rate, and lower monthly payments. She was friendly, courteous, professional, and patient while she answered all of my questions, and made sure that I was fully satisfied with the process of the trade in, and the new car I received. I also appreciate the assistant manager, Derek, who kept my children entertained during the entire process, even staying open after hours, to assist me with this purchase for my family.< /Review>

< Review>
Alex gave us a great deal.  We’d definitely refer people to Carhop and to see Alex. September, 2018.

Additional Post:

This post is dated October 20, 2019. The service that we received from Alex was great but the vehicle that we purchased was the worst in America. It was a piece of junk and should have never been sold in the first place. We kept it for nine months and then gave it back. The vehicle had problems from the first day that we drove it off the lot. Nothing but trouble. We talked to at least 10 people at Carhop! until we finally had to talk to the top people in the home office just to get repairs done. This the worst place ever to purchase a vehicle. Keep your money and don’t do it. To get special financing, we ended up going to Nissan of Fremont and bought a 2018 vehicle that was brand new. Again carhop is a rip off and they target people with bad credit. But just know that you can do better!</Review>

2weeks after purchasing my car my engine cut out on me at a red light. This occurred 2 more times over a 3 week period. After taking the car to O’Reilleys to charge the battery they told me my car had a default battery. And that this would likely keep happening unless I changed or purchased a new battery. Make sure to get a Maintenance check on your car ASAP because there are most likely problems with these cars. You get what you pay for<//text>< resp>

This is a follow-up to my post that I first made, DO NOT BUY A CAR HERE, they lie, first day car overheated took it to one of there mechanic's and said it was the radiator and thermostat, 3 weeks in after it was replaced started overheating again, same mechanic said bad temperature sensor, out of my pocket $200, 3 weeks still overheating. I rely on this car for Uber/ Lyft. That's how I pay my bills. They don't care if you can't make the payment. Car now won't start because of GPS/ starter turned off untill Ballance payed.

Alex hooked me up, great customer service, along with patience. Great step by step awesome deal, low payments.

Check Engine light came on the very next day not even  a full 24 hours. When  I called Megan the lady who I purchased the care from was or as it seemed nice and helpful  and asked about the 7 day car exchange she told me that they would not exchange my car rudely as if it was my fault the car was faulty. She said they would just give my money back. So much for so much for satisfaction guaranteed. Only friendly and helpful until car is sold then your on your own.< /text>

I continuously let her know I have the money on my debit card to make an transaction, however the lady refused and attempts to end the conversation. Now she intends to disable my vehicle with no further explanation. Dezeria C. needs to be terminated as soon as possible. She has created so much frustration and miscommunication. Its horrible!!!

Came in Today, excellent service! Brought me pay stubs and about 1600 and left with some Very, Very well worth the time and money spent. I recommend this specific carhop in Hayward, California to all Bay Area prospective vehicle seekers. Excellent customer service and very willing to work with you on your circumstances. Very thankful I stopped here today, I had my doubts as a pessimist, but they cleared those doubts. 🔑 ✅< /Text>

This review isn't for the employees or location its about the company its self. I have had two cars from here, the first car had a rusted undercarriage which a huge safety issue which they would've never sold it to me if they had looked!! They took that car and gave me a new one and its non stop issues with it its still over heating and they aren't doing anything to help me the shops I take it to does nothing. This car has stalled on me on the freeway going 55 almost caused a huge accident. They don't run tests on the vehicle's they receive as they should, even someone from the finance department told me " I wish this company would do further maintenance on these cars." Carhop only does minor maintenance which is sad! I've had plenty of work done to where I almost have a new cooling system in my car, and still over heating. This company is a joke doesn't help. Its one thing after another. They claim to help us but they end up putting you in a death trap or in a car that just wont start. It causes more stress, but hey how would they get there money right?</review>

Came to car hop with my kids looking into a car that will be reliable for us. I was greeted by Megan who was the only worker working at the time but was able to get me through all my paper work and into a car while handling 3 to 4 other customers. I greatly appreciate her and glad I came to car hop.< /text>

I currently have a vehicle with them , I’ve had my car since August. In November my axel broke while i was driving took it to a shop they sent me to and was told my parts to my car were rusted and they sold me a car that was no good and i keep getting the run around about my vehicle because they basically are saying that is not the case and i need to pay for it, not to mention i almost lost my life in the car . I absolutely would not ever recommend this place EVER .<//text>

I highly recommend purchasing a car from CarHop!  I have just purchased my second vehicle from them.  I am very satisfied with their services. My CarHop Representative/Associate, Ms. Walton, was very helpful and got me in a good car.  Thank you!<//text>

< Review>
Came to car hop with my kids looking into a car that will be reliable for us. I was greeted by Megan who was the only worker working at the time but was able to get me through all my paper work and into a car while handling 3 to 4 other customers. I greatly appreciate her and glad I came to car hop.<//Review>

The representative did a great job! Helped me get a SUV for my family. Thank you! I was forced to do this review in the office before I was given my keys. After receiving the car it broke down on the side of the road 24 hours later. We were stranded until 4am. They towed it from my place that morning , I received a call from the auto shop saying the motor and radiator went out and they could replace it. I called carhop back spoke to the manager Brianna and told her over and over I did not want the car and they are selling broken vehicles. Worst place ever! Save your time and money.<//review>

Alex Urbina was awesome, he found me a great car and had excellent customer service, he worked very hard to find me a car that I really liked!!! Update, my car broke down on the freeway, I haven't had the car a full 24 hrs, they not open yet so I don't know what I'm going to do but I just want my money and I would not deal with them, they have messed up cars.<//text>

Carhop is great, I came in a few montha ago looking to buy a car and Meghan stuck with me through the qhole process until I was ready to get a car. Alex did a great job of picking a car that was just right for me. Thank you Meghan,  Alex and Carhop< /review>

Ridiculous setup. Friend had so so credit, so he wanted to try Car Hop. After the app, they informed him that they would select a vehicle for him based on his credit. He would not be able to choose a car that he likes. Lot was tiny, only a few decent looking cars, and a lot junky ones. Not recommended.< /text>

<review>My vehicle broke down, had no money for a down payment to go purchase another car. Fiancé & I went to Carhop to try our chances and see if can we get a car. Thankfully we were assisted by Megan W., who helped us tremendously and told us everything; crossed her T’s and dotted her I’s. Will definitely be coming back here to purchase another vehicle for the husband!< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I was here for a few hours but Alex was really helpful, knowledgeable and straight forward. He gave me an assessment and I was comfortable moving forward with getting a car that day. I chose one of the 2 cars he showed me and I was on my way. DMV, automatic payments everything already taken care of.
I appreciated all the help Alex gave<//text>

Had Alex (Alejandro) help me and his service was second to known. Got me approved and in a car in no time. Thank you Alex!

Update. Car was leaking oil and they were aware of it. I take the car to one of their shops and they claim it's not covered by yhem even though the car leaked from day 1.</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Car hop is a cool place if you come in knowing what you want and have your stuff together. Go in realizing what you're about to get and research before. I feel people who have problems with car hop expect it to be an end all solution when it is really a stepping stone. Ultimately you can walk in with $150 and leave with a car with basic proof of income and a couple other things.</review><UserId.>103190911204724769005< /UserId.><Gmap_id>0x808f917c6d0e12a9:0x953fff4e47818c64< /Gmap_id><time>1501263720865<//time>< Resp>

This is the 2nd vehicle we've purchased from Car Hop. We love the service we received from Alex Urbina at the Hayward office. From the phone call when making our appointment to the actual appointment and purchase, Alex was polite, pleasant and professional. I sincerely suggest you try Car Hop.</Text>

Well, I traded my 2005 truck in, came out with 2012 sedan. All I can say is that Alex who helped me,was very nice, patient, personable and informative.  This is my second time at car hope, and I highly recommend them for anyone trying to get a second chance at credit. Way to go Alex.

Part2: sad to say I spoke to fast. The sedan I got needed some fixing..ok no problem. Only a problem, because I have gotten the run around, stalling, told me car was at the shop when it sat on car shops lot for 3 days before going. This is the second shop by the way..my car has been out of my posession in shops longer than I have had the vehicle in mine. I had the car 2 n half weeks, been in shops of car hop for a month..something is wrong with this picture.  My patience is running thin,and low at this point..thinking about letting them just keep the car,but havent made that final decision yet. Very unpleasant 2nd time customer at this point.< /Review>

Thank you Alex!  I truly appreciate you help with the car today.

10/8/19 - I had to edit my review.  While the salesman was quite helpful, I had to downgrade my review because of the car itself.

Got a 2009 Chevy Equinox  and trust me, I understand a used car is gonna have issue but I didn't think that it would be 30 days after I got it.

There was a few issues with the car - cylinder misfire prompted me to take the car in and the diagnostic found that it needed a new engine (which they paid for)  but I also need a new catalytic converter (they don't pay for and will cost me around $800), a new thermostat,  and something else that was on the estimate.

Oh so when I called to see if I could make a payment arrangement to get the converter fixed, I was told that I CANT pay later cause you have to make on time payments for the first 6 months (don't remember seeing that anywhere in the paperwork).  So since I know that they will just cut the car off for non payment, I made the payment and have to wait on the repairs.

Its also too late to return the car since it was past the 7 day return policy.

Also they tell you that you have to do autopay.  DONT DO IT!

I had it.  Was told that my payment would come out every other Friday (which is fine since I get paid on that day).  The first payment was due on the 30 via autopay.  When it didnt come out that day, the next morning I paid it.

The following weekday, the autopay kicked in and overdrew my account.  I wrote my account manager and to this day, I still haven't heard back from him.

Unfortunately, I will have to tell people to really consider their options when coming here.  And if possible, go somewhere else.< /Review>

I was with Jerry the salesman and he is a good representative and real funny!!! He told me it would take two hours or more but it actually didn't take that long, he made the time go by fast. I had a good experience and was comfortable with the car I left with. Thank you!! I appreciate it.<//text>

<text>I came in not expecting to get any car and I talked to Jerry and he was so funny and made me feel so comfortable. I had terrible credit and not a lot to put down and he got me driving in 2 hours. I love this place and Jerry is the best salesman ever!! I would recommend this place for everyone who is looking for a car and might have credit issues and not a lot to put down.

Megan is great!  She stayed late for us and got us approved to drive off in a car that same day! She made sure the payments were affordable and fit our price range. Megan answered all of our questions and concerns with no hesitations and no pressure to finalize the sale. We drove off with a 2012 Nissan Sentra and i feel like i finally have a safe and reliable car for my kids and to help my dad to all his doctor appointments thanks to megan and carhop!< /review>

She was very knowledgeable and had a great attitude, she kept a smile on her face and mine.
I was there for awhile, and everyone she dealt with today, got the same energy.
I believe she could one day open her own business..

<Text>Jerry worked with me for over a month to get me into a car that best  suited my needs. When a new car came onto the lot that he knew I  qualified  for, he gave me a call to inform me that he had something else available.
After going back and forth over deciding on what I wanted, I finally came in with my trade in ( a car hop car that I purchased in 2012) and made the deal. I'm happy to say that, I received  the best customer service experience from Jerry at the Hayward location.

Thanks  Jerry< /Text>< Pictures>

Bob and aminah are the absolute best! After my bad experience at Avis and coming to carhop they were completely 100% truthful about everything I got a really good car and approved really quickly! If I had to do it over again I would 😊< /Text>

<review>Me and my bestfriend came to carhop to get her a car. She was under tremendous pressure and needed a car badly. When we first arrived she saw an orange Nissan that she fell in love with instantly. While waiting for approval she encountered a few issues but the staff at CarHop Hayward helped her stay at ease. After a short wait she was approved and the staff were just as excited as we were as we smiled together. Even while being frustrated, the CarHop Hayward team did their very best to provide excellent and efficient customer service. Thanks CARHOP HAYWARD!< /review><user_id>102802676470917713084<//user_id></record>

I had a really great experience at car hop today. Not only am I leaving a happy customer but I'm leaving with more knowledge on how to build my credit. Rico did a good job, he sounds like and knows what he's doing and what he's talking about. Thanks Rico.</review>

DO NOT BUY A CAR HERE !!!! You will regret it. I’ve been taken advantage of these people and you will too if you buy a car here. I never seen a contract they had me fill in my signature on their computer without knowing the price, year, interest rate, payment or total price after financing. These tactics are sneaky. They take advantage of people with bad credit. Don’t be a victim. Stay away from them.< /text>

Alex was my car-seller, bruh put me onto all the cars I qualified for and I was able to drive off the lot without emptying my bank account AND having the lowest credit score in the world lol smh. CarHop in Hayward is legit...frfr....I advise anyone with a license and no car lookin to get on the road, to slide...unless ya just like to walk. I’m mad I took this long to come.</review>

<Text>Walked in because this store had four amazing cars and I wanted to see if I qualified for any of them. However, as soon as the lady saw me she made a face which I decided to ignore because I was sick and I just wanted a car. Well like every usual carhop there was only one person attending everybody so this lady has the nerve to tell me I can't get what I want and to go to another dealer, she hasn't even processed my application because she tells me this as soon as she sits down with me. The lady doesn't even ask me if I wanted to qualify for any other car before shredding my paper up. At this point I wanted to tell her off but I just left because I didn't want to turn into the crazy customer.... definitely had a bad experience, would not recommend<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1488228925352, 'text': 'Hello Laura - Thank you for your feedback.

< review>
Walked in because this store had four amazing cars and I wanted to see if I qualified for any of them. However, as soon as the lady saw me she made a face which I decided to ignore because I was sick and I just wanted a car. Well like every usual carhop there was only one person attending everybody so this lady has the nerve to tell me I can't get what I want and to go to another dealer, she hasn't even processed my application because she tells me this as soon as she sits down with me. The lady doesn't even ask me if I wanted to qualify for any other car before shredding my paper up. At this point I wanted to tell her off but I just left because I didn't want to turn into the crazy customer.... definitely had a bad experience, would not recommend<//review>

<Text>Aminah Herbert helped us drive away with the perfect SUV for our growing family. The process was simpler than cooking dinner, that's for sure! Even with my awful credit, I still was able to leave with what I needed! I didn't expect to even be approved, but having steady income was really all that mattered! Thank you Mrs. Herbert! You were great👍🏽😁<//Text>< pictures>

There is good stuff and bad stuff about this dealership... First off I did refrain from reviewing this place while I was there and had just been approved for a car. It was asked of me to do so and I almost did it just because I was so relieved and happy to be getting a car but I stopped myself because I wanted to make sure that I put my entire experience in this review. So yes we did get a car. We were their 4 1/2 hours. Yup it took that long. My situation is no credit but I own my own business and make good money. So I brought in all the  necessary paperwork, proof of income etc. After a couple of hours our information was “sent up” to whoever they send it to to get approved ... There was some back and forth , then our car salesmen says he is going to let us test drive a vehicle. We thought hey we are finally getting somewhere. So he went off to get keys and my husband and I are wondering why he didn’t ask us which car we wanted  to test drive...We follow him outside and we walk towards the car we want to test drive but he quickly tells us that we are to test drive another vehicle that we don’t even want. We told him no thank you ,we would like to test drive this other car... my husband at this point is just fed up at the whole thing and wanted to leave. I told him no let’s stand our ground and see if we can get something we actually want. I get the feeling that this place takes advantage of ppl in desperate situations and excepts them to accept whatever car they put them in. The car he wanted us to test drive had a broken handle on the passenger side door so you couldn’t open it from the inside, yes it’s not a big fix but it’s definitely not something you want to see in a car you are buying.. So once again more information was collected from us and “sent up” to the approval gods because I guess now we need special consideration to be able to buy a car that we want. And the thing that we didn’t understand is that we have brought in about $8000 twice a month for several years. Didn’t have any outstanding bills didn’t have any creditors after us we just didn’t have any credit. But very employed and making more then enough money to make a decent size car payment, easily. So at about the 4th hour in we are finally okayed to look at some more options. The one that we wanted we still weren’t allowed to look at because of “title issues.” Okay whatever...Instead of having a price tag on it maybe put a sign in the window that says “not for sale” like the other vehicles that weren’t for sale had in their windows..Anyways we test drove another SUV and I fell in love with it so we bought it. Okay other tidbits...they make you sit through and watch the silliest “presentations.”  It frustrating and time consuming..The car selection sucks, we found nails in tires, broken door handles and locks...it’s just a messy place. The hours we spent there we saw a lot of ppl come in but didn’t see anyone leave with a car. I over heard one guy being told that he needed a co-signer..With all this being said, I think this type of place can be a great stepping stone for ppl like us to finally build credit. I also think that they have a great warranty program..It doesn’t cover door handles and nails in tires though...lol Would I buy a car from carhop again,,,yes! Would I go to this location again ? I’d have to say no. Advice is,,try and not to be desperate stand ur ground a bit and hopefully you can get what you want. Good luck!!!</text>

I bought a car from car hop the end of 2015. I've had so many issues starting off.. But Car hop helped. They recently hired a new staff. And they asked me to come in for a trade.. I was a lil un easy because of my previous issues. But they were very patient and understanding. Alex urbina helped me sign a grear deal with a nice suv truck. Thanks for all the hard work.. Youve changed my mind about buying a cae from you guys.. If this one has issues. I'll go back for sure..</text>

<text>Aminah  Herbert was the sales consultant that assisted me in the purchase of my Ford Explorer. And her knowledge and proficiency, as well as her delightful personality , made the whole experience refreshing. I would recommend to anyone in need of purchasing a vehicle, to come the her with no reservation.
Thank you for making my life a lot less stressful!
Sincerely, Bill Norwood  (very satisfied customer )<//text>< Rate>

<Text>The most horrible experience ever in my history of buying cars! They are a complete ripoff...my car is valued for $1000 by Kelley Blue Book and it didn't last long for $10,000! Totally not worth it! Don't let these people fool you! I have a 2001 Hyundai Santa Fe that I will be more than happy to voluntary repossess my car. But thank you for helping me establish credit just so I can mess it up again but I love my new car that I got for $15,000 that is not a ripoff! CarHop is trash and I hope you guys read this and I will see you guys in court. Have a great day!<//Text>< Pics>

There is good stuff and bad stuff about this dealership... First off I did refrain from reviewing this place while I was there and had just been approved for a car. It was asked of me to do so and I almost did it just because I was so relieved and happy to be getting a car but I stopped myself because I wanted to make sure that I put my entire experience in this review. So yes we did get a car. We were their 4 1/2 hours. Yup it took that long. My situation is no credit but I own my own business and make good money. So I brought in all the  necessary paperwork, proof of income etc. After a couple of hours our information was “sent up” to whoever they send it to to get approved ... There was some back and forth , then our car salesmen says he is going to let us test drive a vehicle. We thought hey we are finally getting somewhere. So he went off to get keys and my husband and I are wondering why he didn’t ask us which car we wanted  to test drive...We follow him outside and we walk towards the car we want to test drive but he quickly tells us that we are to test drive another vehicle that we don’t even want. We told him no thank you ,we would like to test drive this other car... my husband at this point is just fed up at the whole thing and wanted to leave. I told him no let’s stand our ground and see if we can get something we actually want. I get the feeling that this place takes advantage of ppl in desperate situations and excepts them to accept whatever car they put them in. The car he wanted us to test drive had a broken handle on the passenger side door so you couldn’t open it from the inside, yes it’s not a big fix but it’s definitely not something you want to see in a car you are buying.. So once again more information was collected from us and “sent up” to the approval gods because I guess now we need special consideration to be able to buy a car that we want. And the thing that we didn’t understand is that we have brought in about $8000 twice a month for several years. Didn’t have any outstanding bills didn’t have any creditors after us we just didn’t have any credit. But very employed and making more then enough money to make a decent size car payment, easily. So at about the 4th hour in we are finally okayed to look at some more options. The one that we wanted we still weren’t allowed to look at because of “title issues.” Okay whatever...Instead of having a price tag on it maybe put a sign in the window that says “not for sale” like the other vehicles that weren’t for sale had in their windows..Anyways we test drove another SUV and I fell in love with it so we bought it. Okay other tidbits...they make you sit through and watch the silliest “presentations.”  It frustrating and time consuming..The car selection sucks, we found nails in tires, broken door handles and locks...it’s just a messy place. The hours we spent there we saw a lot of ppl come in but didn’t see anyone leave with a car. I over heard one guy being told that he needed a co-signer..With all this being said, I think this type of place can be a great stepping stone for ppl like us to finally build credit. I also think that they have a great warranty program..It doesn’t cover door handles and nails in tires though...lol Would I buy a car from carhop again,,,yes! Would I go to this location again ? I’d have to say no. Advice is,,try and not to be desperate stand ur ground a bit and hopefully you can get what you want. Good luck!!!<//review>

<Text>DO NOT EVER GET A CAR HERE

I got a car from here when I just turned 18 and didn't know anything which was a mistake. You get the car and it's cool for a couple days and then problems unfold.
My car was complete garbage. They sold it to me for $9000 and the Kelly blue book price was $1500. & on top of that, I HAD TO TAKE IT TO THE SHOP MULTIPLE TIMES because the mechanics REFUSED to fix what was wrong.
All these nice reviews are here BC people are happy with their car right now, but soon they'll be in the same boat I am in, ready to take to small claims court because they still refuse to fix my car. So ridiculous.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1502475085064, 'text': 'Hello Natasha --Thank you for your feedback.

<review>I came to this location a bit hesitant if I was going to get approved or not, but to my surprise Megan tried everything she could to help me out and it definitely worked. She informed me of the options she had available with my situation before she did everything not like other places they show you the most expensive vehicle and you leave disappointed. Recomend this place to get a vehicle.</review>< Pictures>

Megan is ghetto and has horrible  Customer service .  She got mad at me because I didn't wanna buy a car for 180,000 miles on it for 9000 dollars. So rude and unprofessional they need to train there workers about how to deal with customers. DO NOT BUY A CAR HERE you will regret it !</Text>

<Review>This pass week I went and got a car & Meagen helped me! (my apologies if I’m spelling your name wrong) Months prior to my appointment this pass week, I was really worried about getting another car after being sold a lemon! However, meagen reassured of doing the best she can in getting me in something I would like, and that’s reliable. She was very informative, took her time, but she also took into consideration I had my cranky and hungry 1 year old with me. After being approved she showed me a few options, we talked, then I signed my paperwork! Meagen is awesome and will really work with you! She did all that she could for me and I left there feeling really accomplished and just like I did when I bought my first car when I was in college! I can’t thank her enough! Go to meagen!! You won’t be disappointed!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808f917c6d0e12a9:0x953fff4e47818c64</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Mike was AWESOME! He made sure my questions were answered and my needs were met. I highly recommend CarHop, and I hope that all of the sales representatives are as wonderful as Mike ! Thanks Mike & CarHop.

I came to this location a bit hesitant if I was going to get approved or not, but to my surprise Megan tried everything she could to help me out and it definitely worked. She informed me of the options she had available with my situation before she did everything not like other places they show you the most expensive vehicle and you leave disappointed. Recomend this place to get a vehicle.<//review>

<Text>Alex is a con artist. Carhop advertised a 100 down sale. The car he alledgly sold me was a gray market vehicle. The VIN is generic for the make of the car. The plates don't match and have no tags. He had me electronically sign documents that weren't a contract. They are electronically titling illegally. Don't buy from them<//Text></record></dataset><record>

He worked with me to get me a great price on a car and had me driving off the lot. Like i said i was expecting a no due to bad credit and a repo on record but alex made it possible and i left with a smile. Thanks again alex.< /Review>< Pictures>

I was initially impressed being that I too was in desperate need of a car with horrible credit.  I was able to get into a car, not my first choice but it was something and I needed it.  Ran into some issues with the driver door. After about three weeks run around, it was fixed. From then until now, this car has broken down on me on the freeway.  Automatically shutting off.  No warnings nothing.  Took me a few minutes to just let the car “rest”. Then restarted like there was nothing wrong.  Heater is no longer working AND the same day, the motor in my driver side and back passenger side windows are broken. To top it off, two miles over my 18,000 or 18 month warranty 😳. AND I cannot trade in for another til September 2018 when “I will be low enough to finance a better car.”

I am now back in the same situation I was in over a year ago, only thing now, I have a car that is not worth trading AND the car is not worth a trading value.

CarHop is exactly what they are for and cater towards the “I need Something NOW with what I have.”  You have to look into the longevity of whatever your going to finance and ensure that it will last the duration of the loan or you can be where I am at now, stuck making seeking payments on a car that is unsafe to drive your kid in.

UPDATE:
I set up automatic pay.  They offer you a “break” after paying 6 months in good standing.  I used it once because my biweekly payments come out automatically.  I had ONE error where I did over calculate myself that resulted in a returned payment.  SO I just recently asked for a new “break” in payment to see if I can get a diagnostic on this car so I can drive it in a safe manner...mind you, since the heater does not work and neither the windows, I got really sick .. hospital sick!! The customer service person said I qualified no problem, my payment can successfully be skipped and she entered that I could miss this upcoming payment.  As I am sick in the hospital, call from CarHop finance.  I was told I was late three days and how did I intend on making a payment!!! TALK ABOUT LIVID!!!! So now I am dealing with this TOO because this is now a ding on ME and it wasn’t even my error!!!!

Update TWO:

I did not receive a voicemail from anyone except collections still trying to collect something that I was clearly not my error!< /text>

<Review>Aminah was super friendly and upbeat. Very nice to talk to. I was able to explain my situation and she was very understanding. I have no credit and she was able to get me approved. The cars that were approved for me I didn't like, but aminah got me approved for another that I liked.
The whole process was very easy. I definitely recommend people to come to carhop if u have bad or no credit like me<//Review>< Pics>

<date>1450240043742</date><review>Um.. Wow! Aminah at the Hayward lot really helped me out! Even though I was pretty tired she was able to realize that and I felt as though we were able to get right to the point of business and I really liked that. She also made sure that I got into a pretty cool car.. I thought I'd maybe qualify for a year 2000 but I was able to get a 2007 vehicle that is in great condition and even has a sunroof! I couldn't be happier and I know everyone I personally know will be very proud of this purchase..came in with my hopes down and I left with everything I could of wanted and more! Thank you Aminah, and thank you Car Hop. Also, I researched into this- there were a lot of bad reviews about this place which I must say- I have experienced none of it.  I'm a very satisfied customer.<//review><user_name>Jessica Marie<//user_name>< Rate>

I knew what to expect when i came it. I wasnt looking for the best car ever just one to get me where i need to be. Michael Rico helped me within an hour. As long as you know what you are paying for carhop can be a bad or a good option. In my circumstance, my carhop experience was extraordinary.< /text>

I am in the car business and my little brother came here because of his work time the car he bought Kelly blue booked at 1025 I know because I booked it my self the then proceeded to charge him 9500 dollars to finance the vehicle for those of you that don't understand they charged him 920% more that what the KBB was this is a rip off for a vehicle with 140000 miles people don't let them fool you when I called to ask what the numbers were I was told I don't know those numbers..... But you do know how to burn people..... I bet the DMV would have a hay day at this location oh ya I know about the laws as well guys....Have a good day< /review>

Just got my car if you go up here ask for Megan she is the best , update it’s 10/30/18 the car I got has tons of problems so what you should do is take it one of carhops mechanics have them do a diagnostics for 90 dollars and if it’s under your warrantee they will fix it free just remember the first 30 days after that you have to pay for it, so far I had the car for 2 months i came out the packet for 486 dollars and still doing repairs.<//Review>

This place will definitely go up and beyond and work with you to get you in a car and financed, that's there job but also they don't tell you that these cars ain't worth it I would kbb all these cars and bring a mechanic with you since day 1 of having this car problems within 3 months I was getting a refurbished engine so do your research cause if not a lemon is what you will be squeezing your last into< /review>

I have heard a couple different stories about car hop some were bad and others were great. I went in to see for myself I worked with Aminah she made the process so easy and simple. I went in not sure what to expect so when she ran my credit she presented me with options which was a nice touch. I really recommend anyone and everyone to speak with Aminah, she is patient and iinformative 5 stars for me<//review>

< Review>
Ms Walton had me wait 1 hour just to tell me they said your not eligible for a car. When I specifically talk to John and he said your eligible come on in so we can get you driving. Ms Walton was also very rude to one of her other clients and told them flat out you have horrible credit just because he didn't want one of those cars she was offering  was very unprofessional. Won't deal with carhop again<//Review>

Got fooled into buying a lemon after multiple visits to their​ "mechanic" never fixed the initial problem. After the warranty wore out nothing they could do. The car is only worth around 8 grand but I'm the whole for $12,000

Went here once & they turned me down about 3 years ago. Called last year to get some information again and the lady at this location was extremely rude over the phone! So I need a car again and thought about going in again but choose to look at the reviews first & I WOULD NEVER buy a car hear. Just hearing the bad reviews & knowing stuff is still rude, a place like this would never get my money!< /text>

Got a car,  which is what i came for. Would get 5* if i didn't have to pay over $10k for a 15 year old car worth less than $3k. If you have the money and credit,  go to a real dealership.  My car stopped running literally an hour after getting my keys.  They didnt Wana tow it back themselves. I was hung up in multiple times,  transferred to different states. so once I got it started took it back,  got my trade-in and down payment back. Bought the car at 1pm, was returned by 4.<//Text>

CarHop is quite different than other car dealerships in that we offer a program, not just a vehicle.  The program includes a warranty, financing and personalized payment plan.  This program is a commonly a very good fit for people who are trying to get a used vehicle while also trying to improve their credit score.  While buying a car for cash does not help improve one’s credit score, we respect your interest in buying a cash car and wish you the best in your vehicle search.  If you have further questions, please contact us at talk2us@carhop.com and a helpline representative will contact you back within 24 business hours. Thank you.'}<//response>< GmapID>
