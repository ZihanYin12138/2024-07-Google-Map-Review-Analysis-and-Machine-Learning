My family has been going to the Redhawk and Winchester locations for years. It is run by the same management and often staffed by the same ladies who are all kind and do a fantastic job. Yesterday I had a change of heart after deciding to try a new haircut to replace my
Quarantine mop. So I wanted some changes. : ) They were super good-natured about it (I offered to pay for a full new haircut but they wouldn’t have it) and both ladies did a fantastic job. I highly recommend both locations and the double MVP!!! You really can’t go wrong with any stylist at either location. Thank you Sport Clips Temecula!< /Text>

My kids have been getting buzz cuts because of sports (at their request) for a number of years and never even wanted to go to a salon. My son was going to homecoming and I offered him the spa treatment at sport clips. I wanted him to have a nice cut, not just a “mommy cut”. He looks like a different kid now and he looks wonderful! His hair was pretty short but she styled it and he loved it so much. Thank you for making him look awesome for his special day. He will be coming back- he loved the “spa” treatment!<//Text>

The only place I take the three boys for a haircut. They have grown up at this sports clips. I never have to request anyone because they are all awesome.

Update 12/30/19
Today I went in for my regular haircut and had a very unique experience. Within 10 minutes of sitting down the power for the entire shopping center went down. Though the power went out, the staff working, made the best of the situation and made every attempt to finish my haircut. Though the power was out all 3 of the employees working worked together to hold camera lights to give light to the stylist cutting my hair (I was the only customer in the building at the time) which made me extremely happy with the amazing commitment and level of customer service given, going above and beyond what I could have hoped for in this situation. They apologized for the inconvenience, and made every attempt to do their best, which is all I could ask for. This particular establishment has always gone above and beyond in satisfying customer needs. I was more than satisfied with my haircut and even with minimal tools available, they did an amazing job which demonstrated to me the quality and level of expertise that goes into training Sports Clips employees. I wrote my previous review a year ago and the service has maintained it's amazing quality. If I could give 6 stars as a review I would, and I continue to look forward to coming back this location for many more years, Thank you for your amazing level of customer service Sports Clips Team!

This was my first time ever trying out a different haircut venue and it was probably the best experience I've ever had getting a haircut. Stephanie who cut my hair was very friendly and helped with the tiny details with my cut spending a gracious amount time cutting it, this made me feel really valued as a customer knowing the effort, quality, and time she spent. I will be returning to this sports clips for all my future haircuts!</Text>

Great place and service.  Military friendly and affordable haircut.  It was my first time visiting Sports Clips Haircuts towards the end of the day but I did not feel rushed at all. Rather, I got a great haircut that I expected and the girls that work at Sport Clips Haircuts of Temecula seemed very professional and ensured that I was satisfied with the haircut.  Highly recommended.</Text>

I had never been to a Sports Clips ever because I normally cut my own hair. Yesterday I decided I wanted a professional to do it since I have a special event coming up. I’m so glad I decided to come to Sports Clips because Evelyn was wonderful and she took the time to listen to what I wanted and made great suggestions.  I also had the MVP, which added to the great experience. I’m definitely coming back.</review>

<Text>There was some slight confusion about the MVP discount for first time customers. I have been to sports clips before but not at this location. So the MVP discount is for new people who have never been to any location. But they gave me the discount anyway which was nice.< /Text>< pictures>

My son had a cupón for an MVP treatment from an award he won at school.  He was super hesitant to try it out and ended up loving the cut and the royal treatment.  Both of my sons love it.  Now I don’t know if they’ll let me go back to a regular barber shop.  The staff was great too!<//review>

<Review>Decided on a whim to cut my hair, and since i couldn't go to my regular shop in San Diego, I chose this place. I like barber shops because they are more no-nonsense, and don't try to upsell you on services like full stylings or products. Crystal did an excellent job! She asked me what i was looking to have done, and took her time making sure that i liked what she was doing. I trusted her skill and gave the basic layout of what i was hoping for. I was not disappointed! She did an excellent job and i love my haircut. I was nervous cutting of my length but she reassured me that it would be worth it, thank you Crystal!< /Review>< Time>

Came here for the first time and VERY pleasantly surprised!  Breana is the best!

My regular stylist moved out of state, so I thought that I would be on a very long and arduous task of finding her replacement.  My hair is difficult to cut and is (unfortunately) mostly grey, so it is also wirey.  It took me a long time to find my old stylist and have seen her exclusively for the past several years.

It was such an incredible surprise to find Breana as she cut my hair just as good (maybe even better) than my old stylist!  Search over!  Thank you and I will be seeing Breana exclusively from now on!< /Text>

It's not so much the atmosphere as is the great quality talent that they have working there. Most people have difficulty cutting my hair; however, I've really been impressed with everything since I've been going over the past year. Best styled clips for a great price. Shannon and the girls are really top notch. You won't be disappointed.< /Text>

I liked the atmosphere and the decor of the place and the stylist are nice but everyone has different types of hair and requires individual attention.  Ashley took the time to try and do what I wanted my style to be but didn't really give her 💯 in order to make me feel like going back to her but I will try it again later to see if their attention has Improved....</review>

First time at a Sport Clips location. I was looking to get a bit more than a haircut in both service and treatment. I had Natalie, she did a great job. Took her time throughout the whole process. I never felt I was being rushed through the different steps. Its a bit expensive for a guy's haircut, but worth it for the treatment and what you get.< /text>

Best haircut in the Temecula Valley area, plus you're just across the street from the mall and a ton of restaurants. The MVP is a great deal since a couple extra bucks gets you a refreshing steamed towel on your face while they massage your scalp, neck, and shoulders. Go see Jada if you want a quick & great haircut with a fun conversation too if you're not too busy watching sports on your own personal HDTV.</Text>

I have been having to go different places Because they screw up my hair.
This is not any different, I SPECIFICALLY gave her directions on how I wanted it, and she screws it up.

Comes to prove 10,15, or $25 does t make the person do better.< /review>

< Review>
I’ve been doing some astrophotography and needed a remote for my camera in bulb mode. I’d never been in the store but called and the item was described and, in stock.

The salesman showed me exactly how to use it, tested it on my camera to make sure it functioned and, it was less than what I thought I was going to spend.

I’m actually very impressed with the store, the help and advice I got and of course the price.

Thank you. Great store, great staff and, easy parking out front.</Review>

Was in for a repair recently and due to Peggy's knowledge  of the camera manufacturer,  I was able to get an upgraded camera for the price of repairing my existing unit.

A plus, this business is bricks and mortar.  I would never have received repair service in the 13 days it took from the day I brought in the failing camera to the day I picked up the upgrade had I not had this personal service.<//review><user>101907895948553790767<//user><name>Dawn Beattie</name>< Response>

<review>The best photo shop in town! It may even be the only one? I had them send in my Nikon 14-24 lens to Nikon because it wouldn't mount correctly onto the body and the cost to get it fixed was cheaper than the quote Nikon gave me online! (Although still expensive as camera things go) but the staff were all very friendly and things got done very quick. Would come back for all my camera needs! Shop local!<//review>< gmap_id>

I have been a customer for many years and have always been very satisfied with Peggy and her staff's friendliness, helpfulness, good prices, great customer support and technical knowledge. There are good reasons when the other camera shops in town went out of business that this shop remained. If your looking to update from your smart phone to a real camera, to upgrade your current camera, or to get accessories for your SLR, this is the place to go.</Text>< Pictures>

I cannot recommend this shop enough.  They are thoroughly helpful and not pushing a sales agenda, it was such a pleasure dealing with a shop that is passionate about what they do and truly want their customers to get what they need, and know how to use the equipment that they purchased.  I felt well taken care of there.</review>

Staff were friendly and helpful. I only bought some cleaning supplies, but I got some good information from the guy at the counter, and the shop seemed to have a lot of the things you may need that you couldn't find at a regular store. It was pricier than online, however that's sort of to be expected when buying niche stuff at a physical location</text>

<Text>Appreciated the coffee bar and Lyft service. Communication was based on text messages. From reminders, payment cost, signatures needed, etc. I found it too much. Once my car service was finishing, I received a text which I responded to but didn’t get a response back? Once I finished work I found it difficult to contact the front desk to get a Lyft to pick up my car. Luckily I work close by and my coworker was able to drive me there! They close at 6<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1621783618500, 'text': 'We are glad you liked the added services to something that can be quite inconvenient, Kaye.

This a delayed review from a 2018 recall for the blower motor harness. We had the car for the recall and right after we picked up the car, we started to feel a strong chemical odor coming from the vents.

We waited a few days for it to dissipate but it didn't. We went back and talked to the service manager, Steve Hooper who looked at the car trying to identify the smell.  A little while later he said 'he couldn't duplicate  the problem'.  We took the car home and hoped the smell would go away on its own but it didn't.  We went back to them to look into it again a few days later. They kept there overnight and the next day refused to deal with it saying it doesn't smell.
......Fast forward to 2020, the car still smells as soon as the fan is on.
They didn't want to bother with us because the car was, sorry, out of warranty.  Thank you Peter Pan, lousy customer service and we are not the only customers complaining about it.
BMW owners, take your car somewhere else, you've been warned.< /review>

<Review>I did not have a good experience here. I recently purchased a used BMW and attempted to get the last service information on the vehicle that Carfax didn't provide. All I asked was about the work performed on the vehicle for its last service. I made it clear that I did not want the previous owner's information, just the details of the last service on the vehicle. Gus, a representative of the dealership, told me that he could not provide any information to me about my vehicle as he stated it was due to a privacy law.

I asked Gus if giving me the last service information performed on my vehicle was covered by the privacy law or was it a policy of the company. Gus eventually told me, "it's what they tell us to say".

I respect the privacy of the previous owner and did not want their information, just the service performed on the vehicle. I didn't know a car had rights.< /Review>< rating>

BUYER BEWARE- They BROKE our car and didn't take responsibility.  We had an awful experience here.  We brought our BMW X5 in for a drivers side airbag recall and this is what happened...

After my husband picked up our car after the "repair" and left Peter Pan we discovered our horn stopped working- the exact part of the car they worked on as this is where the drivers side airbag is.  When we called to let them know, they stated they would not provide a loaner car and we would have to wait for them to "analyze" the car to see if they were responsible.  After arguing with them they said they would do us a "favor" and provide a loaner car, wow, how generous!  They later called and stated that they completed their inspection and they decided that they were not responsible.  Luckily, we just had our BMW serviced through our trusted and honest mechanic (unlike Peter Pan).  He confirmed our horn was working fine and also let us know he had heard many stories like this about Peter Pan.  He said he warns people about using them because of customer complaints just like this.  When we complained to our service provider, Gus, he said that they were sure that it was just a "coincidence" and said we would have to pay an additional $400 to have them further inspect the horn.  Unbelievable!  We let him know how this looked and he was abrupt and rude and said that they did us a favor by not charging to do the initial inspection of their faulty work.  This was shocking. Their complete disregard for their customers and the appalling customer service was not at all the experience we have had at other BMW dealerships.

We then read many of the reviews below and wish we had prior to bringing my car to them.  We encourage everyone to read the reviews below.  This outfit has no regard for their customers.  We will be sure to inform everyone in our community of their business practices to ensure nobody else has their car damaged by Peter Pan.

On a secondary note, they made us wait for an hour after my initial appointment to be serviced.  When we came back in to pick up our car a salesperson approached my husband to sell us on 4 new tires, keep in mind we just bought two tires less than a year ago from American Tires and we knew two were close to needing replacement.  He insisted we needed all four replaced.  The salesman was politely told no thanks, which the salesman wouldn't accept.  He persisted to the point that he had to be told "no" four more times.  Finally, he got within a foot of my husbands face pushing his paperwork on him.  Keep in mind we are wearing face masks and we are supposed to be socially distancing.  My husband finally had to get up from his chair and walk away from him.  We let my service manager Gus know this and he said please give me a good review online, that wasn't my fault.  It's clear that this outfit cares only about up selling it's clients rather than servicing them for the items they came in for with no regard for customer care of safety.</text>

Extraordinary service here usually get a loaner and a free car wash with service. Bought the additional service warranty after 50,000 miles and it's worth it. No worries over small stuff. Staff is very courteous.<//Review>

1. The service was delayed for a few days for some unreasonable mistake in the documentation. I had to call into the dealership and leave the car at the service while we were working through the issues. On the bright side, at least I didn't have to pay for my car staying there all that time.

2. After the service was done, I found white chalk-like shoe prints all over the back seats. No idea what have caused it, by felt very unpleasant to me. Had to take the car to wash after.< /Review>< pictures>

BMW is running a door actuator scam. Why you think they carry them at dealerships, because it's an easy way to charge $1,600 for 3-4 hours of work.</review>

<review>Just had the worst experience today at Peter Pan BMW service in Burlingame. If I could give them zero stars, I would. From reading all the reviews it seems that they make a habit of overcharging customers and not disclosing what the charges are going to be upfront. My wife and I were one of those victims. We brought our I3 in because the car would not start. In reading about the problem online it looked like it was just a 12v battery replacement and I informed the dealer about this. They let us know that our car was covered by BMW’s warranty until July so we decided to have the car towed to the dealer.  Jordan from service called and also reached out by text with an estimate that has since been deleted because we can’t pull it up on the phone anymore.  Our estimate was $566 on that text.  That’s when I got on the phone to talk to Jordan and informed her that the battery cost is only $125 and can easily be replaced in 20 minutes. She immediately offered me a $100 discount. It seems that they were trying to charge my wife as much as they can get away with then easily discounting their fees when I expressed concern. We reluctantly agreed since the car was already there and was not drivable. We picked up our car after four days expecting to pay around $466 which is the amount Jordan quoted me on the phone as my total. We were surprised to see that they still charged us the $200 for diagnosing the car.  The way Jordan explained it to us, if the car was going to be worked on, the diagnostic fee would be waived.  A complete lie as she even explained to my wife that she would do what she could to find things she could charge to BMW.  She never told me on the phone about the $200 diagnostic fee and I was the last person that talked to her about the total cost of our repair. On the phone she gave me the total of $466 and when we picked up the car, the total was $639.  Whatever warranty she said we had was completely useless. We did not have a choice but to pay for it in order to get our car back. I will never go back to that service department ever again and I am writing this to warn all other BMW owners to be careful with this service department. I just don’t want anybody else being taken advantage of by this dealership. This has to stop.</review><gmapID>0x808f77cb6f80de99:0x6243a2b87bd1bbab</gmapID>< rating>

< Review>
Took my 2001 E46 330i in for recall airbag service and received a loaner from BMW Advisor “Kenny Lew”. After receiving the loaner, my advisor told me the vehicle would be ready by the end of the day on Friday and that additional charges for the vehicle would accrue if the loaner was not dropped off by the allotted time. I received text updates when my vehicle was ready, however I had to let my advisor know that because I get off work at 5:30pm, I may not be able to drop off by 6pm (closing time).

I received passive aggressive texts from Kenny: “I was hoping to avoid this issue by informing you this morning the loaner had to be returned by 6pm today as the recall repair would be ready the same day”. I responded by saying I was sorry and that I didn’t know the service center would be closed all weekend.

The loaner service agreement says loaner vehicles should be dropped off no more than 12 hours after the vehicle is finished. It also states the check in time for the vehicle was on Monday at 7:23AM (checked out Friday at 7:23 AM). The loaner contract is confusing but still, I understood and signed the agreement.

When I came to pick up my vehicle on Monday and drop off the loaner vehicle, the nice lady at the desk took my loaner paperwork and checked the vehicle mileage and condition. When she came back she told me that I owed $89/day for a total of $178 for having the vehicle over the weekend. I expressed to her the issue I was having and could not make it back to the service center on time the previous Friday. She was accommodating and said she could knock down the price to $100. She also told me that Kenny had previously told her that I was told to deliver the vehicle on time, and that there should not be exceptions made for my case.

It truly seemed because I was a “recall customer,” I had a low judgement by my service advisor. Every person I talked to seemed to have been previously told by Kenny that I should be charged extra for not being able to return my vehicle by the end of the day, even though I only had 30 minutes to do so after work.

I find it ridiculous my service advisor went to such great lengths to charge me extra and not be accommodating to my situation. I essentially had to talk to the manager to get the entire loaner fee waived. He was extremely professional, understanding, and accommodating of the situation. Moreover, Kenny had previously told him about the situation and how I should be charged extra fir keeping the loaner over the weekend.

It just goes to show how when you bring in an old BMW for service, your service advisor may treat you differently than if you had brought in a newer vehicle. The judgement placed on me and my vehicle from Kenny was unprofessional and unwarranted. The manager was more than willing to accommodate my request to waive the fee.

I HIGHLY ADVISE NOT GOING WITH “KENNY LEW” AS YOUR SERVICE ADVISOR AT PETER PAN BMW.</Review>

< review>
Bad experience - will not go back and would not recommend to others:
Brought my M240i for service because I thought it would be convenient to have the car serviced while at work in SSF. Dropped off at 9am (per appointment) - was promised the car back by end of the day. I called in three times through the day to make sure the car would be ready, and my calls were never returned. At 4.30 pm I got the call saying the car would have to be kept overnight.
Ok, so stuff happens - but I would have expected a call at noon to let me make alternative arrangements or at least offer me a courtesy car overnight. Instead I had to Uber back home from work, and then again in the morning - which ended up costing me over $150.
The BMW connected app on my phone confirmed the car was sitting parked and locked all day until 4pm, so if they knew they didn't have time to work on the car all day, why give me an appointment at 9 am, and why not telling me early on?</review>

<Text>Conveniently located right off 101. Nice waiting area that has plenty of seating with tables plus plenty of couch seating as well. There is a television, complementary coffee machine and sometimes muffins. There is a charging station in case your device runs low. Drop off is fast and efficient. Alexa is the best service rep I have ever worked with. Today they got my car back to me within two hours. The team here has always done a great job for me.

<Review>This is a rating for the General Manager Jim and his horrifying business practices that endanger children's lives during COVID:

We were called by this location and asked when we would like to bring in our car for it’s maintenance of an oil change during COVID, we asked if we could push off given our daughter has epilepsy. The sales men said it would void our warranty - note this sales men can see our lease mileage. We decided to risk it as they called again, and made plans all around safety. When we arrived they said our car was no longer under warranty and they wanted to charge us $650. They also took 0 responsibility for the bait and switch, and said they don’t know who called. We talked to the General Manager of the Dealership: Jim and the General Manager of the Service Dept: Bob to make this right, and they didn’t and were extremely unprofessional. During the drop off the Service folks let us know they weren’t getting any business, so this was a push by them and they know it (Marketing 101). I hope they can live with themselves that they decided to pressure us into bringing our car in, so they can make a few hundred dollars while risking our daughters life. Awesome work.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><rating>1</rating>< response>

This has been my BMW service center for the past 7 years with 2 different bimmers. My service writer John DePalma is fantastic and provides above and beyond customer service and advice. The staff here is always courteous and makes it worthwhile for me to drive out of my way from SF--because I know they'll do a good job.</Review>

<Gmap_id>0x808f77cb6f80de99:0x6243a2b87bd1bbab</Gmap_id><Text>So, I'll start out by saying, I consider dealerships as "stealerships" in my book. I do my own work whenever possible.

That being said, I really enjoyed the process of being able to drop my car off, get constant txt message updates, and have the work done in relatively short order.

I was thoroughly pleased with the detailing after the fact. The car was spotless and I felt embarrassed I left trash in the back. A little extra goes a long way.

The one point I thought didn't leave a good taste, is about being able to check the underside of the car via a lift. I was informed the car was "too low" to be put up. The car is lower, but high enough for the OG stock half scissor jack the car comes with. If I can lift up the car with the factory jack, you should be able to lift it with your commercial grade lifts.

So I felt it was a cop out not to check the underside and get it out of there. I didn't care too much (since I already have a good idea whats underneath), but it was the principal that bothered me.

Nonetheless, being a first time E46 owner, I felt treated like a first class citizen, even for an airbag change (recall). It's not BMW, It's a lifestyle.</Text><user_name>Bogdan Visan</user_name>< user>

<review>I was very disappointed with the way I was treated by assistant service manager Gus. I brought my husband’s car for a recall service (my husband is recovering after a surgery). Gus misinterpret our insurance policy and refused to provide me with  a loaner car. I had to get a rental car from Enterprise to get to work. Our insurance agent called Gus and explained that he was wrong, he agreed and replied that I’ll be able to get a loaner car the next day if car is not ready. Thankfully, it was ready and I was able to pick it up next morning.
However, there were no apology or reimbursement for a rental car.< /review>< date>

Called the service center on Monday to schedule a time to get the airbag recall job done, was able to complete and schedule an appointment for the next morning within minutes.
Was running late to the service center in the morning, got there and they were very courteous. Front desk was able to check me in and offer me a shuttle ride to work within minutes. In those minutes, I was able to enjoy their very fun touchscreen coffee machine (free muffin was nice too).
Shuttle driver was also very courteous and got me to work with no issues.
Received a call from Kenny later in the afternoon telling me everything was completed and he also gave me a brief overview of a quick complimentary inspection they did.
Scheduled a shuttle pickup for 5pm. The driver even gives me a call 15 minutes ahead of time to let me know he's on his way, and arrives promptly 2 minutes before 5pm.
Walk to front desk, sign a few papers, pickup key, and was done and ready to drive out again within minutes.
Incredibly surprised to see they also washed my car (I hadn't washed it in months and it was caked with dirt).
Ever more pleasantly surprised later to find out in the paperwork that they also filled my tires and washer fluid and oil and provided a great report and recommendations (without sales pressure) on issues they found.
I know the things I'm mentioning are usually considered small or even standard for service centers, but considering that I wasn't even really a paying customer and only came in for the free recall maintenance, I was truly impressed by their quality of service.</text>

<Review>I bought a used car in peter pan in 2017. There is an abnormal gap in my car's steering wheel. I have been repairing many problems here. I still get the answer today. My car is like this. There is no way to repair it. My family is not having such a problem when driving BMW. My car has this problem. The engineer also said that my car has no problem. I didn't respond when I drove up and moved the steering wheel. Only when I moved the steering wheel in a wide range would it react. I just want to ask if a car like BMW will protect people's safety. If someone is responsible for personal safety, this is a joke about taking life. This incident has a great impact on me. I am very disappointed with BMW after-sales service.<//Review>< pics>

God forbid you own a bmw and need to get service or maintenance.<//review>< Pics>

Unfortunately each time we’ve gone here the service took way to long. It took over an hour to just drop off our car even though we had an appointment. Our specialist was late and non-communicative. It also took a full day to get an oil change which is ridiculous.< /text>

Typical BMW service center. Nothing extra good or bad. Once my service package from initial car purchase is complete, I go over to my personal mechanic where you can develop more of a relationship for your car's care.</text>

<Text>Getting there was a little bit of a challenge, but not too difficult. There's signage everywhere telling you where to go, so it's almost impossible to get lost. The staff were friendly and helpful, they answered all my questions and generally put me at ease. The customer lounge is open, comfortable, and has free WiFi. Communication throughout the service was precise and comprehensive. 5/5</Text>< pics>

I explained the problem to advisor and foreman  and we did test drive the car together me and foreman, After test drive foreman says I know  what is causing the problem. i left my car with them after few days I receive a text that car is ready for pickup, I asked advisor if problem is fixed advisor says well we changed the part but we are not sure if is fixed or not. My question is if you’re not sure car is fixed why in first place you said you know what the problem is and how could you call inform me car is ready for pickup which is not ready and is not fixed and why you charged me when car still has the same problem I asked advisor to put in writing but he refused to do it asked him to put foreman’s findings after part replacement he refused to do it also he said because this issue is with most of 6 series models and BMW of USA is ignoring the issue we can not put it writing. First they estimated repair cost would be around $2200  but when I asked them to use my extended warranty advisor said what warranty  I told him premier Red Shield warranty all of sudden cost was dropped to $1200 dollars I guess that was the reason car wasn’t fixed and most probably they haven’t even changed the part when I asked for old part they sent me picture of it!!</text>

He was super responsive with my questions and when it came to purchase time, both he and the dealership were very honest and straight forward.  In fact, I got in and out in about an hour!

I have purchased and serviced my BMW's at Peter Pan for over a decade!  The past few years I have been lucky enough to have the same Service Advisor : Kenny Lew.  I can only say amazing things about Kenny!  He is professional, honest, efficient and just a pleasure to work with!!  Truly outstanding!  Thank you Kenny for always making my visits to the service department as smooth as possible.<//review>

I brought my car into the Peter Pan BMW Service Center for regular maintenance, rotation of tires, and for a check engine light. I was late to the appointment, but Jordan Carrick was accommodating, and knowing that there were a lot of customers, was able to expedite my paperwork and get me set up with a courtesy car. She is always professional and friendly, and I enjoy my experience every time I work with her. She always communicates with me and provides excellent service. Over the years, we have had some really entertaining conversations, and gotten to know her.< /Review>

<Review>MAKE SURE YOU DOUBLE CHECK YOUR CAR BEFORE YOU DROP IT OFF. Take pictures of your miles, gas tank, tires. My car was returned  DAMAGED. When I inquired about the damage they claimed to not be at fault. We paid to get a detail, Mind you the detail cost $300, and they damaged the interior and left wax on the exterior! We had full tank of gas and the car was returned on E. I’m pretty sure they used it for a joy ride. I won’t be coming back, just a headache & more problems.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Text>I had a very good experience! The service agent worked very hard to expeditiously collaborate with AAA on my repair claim since I was 250 miles from home. I was amazed at how smoothly she took care of many details, demonstrated a great working relationship with the AAA representative, and kept me informed in a timely manner.  The office is consistently clean, people are courteous and efficient, and all of my questions get answered.< /Text><Name>Candice Coursey</Name><response>None<//response></record>

<text>Service and Parts has worst communication and processes ever.  Their negligence cost me nearly 25 HOURS.

I called to ask how to get a duplicate key made.
1.  Service person who answered call didn't bother to tell me that the service and parts was located at the different location from their main facility - had to got to another town.  (Main facility didn't even bother apologizing for the mix-up). (20 min lost)
2.  Service person didn't tell me I needed to come in the morning to have the key ready the next day, EVEN THOUGH I TOLD HIM I WOULD BE COMING IN THE AFTERNOON.
3.  Had no guest parking so parked in the back.  Was informed by technician I'm not allowed to park or to be back here.  Of course, no sign informing me. (15 min. lost)
4.  Service person told me key wouldn't be ready for 2 days because I had come too late in the afternoon.  (24 hours lost)
5.  When I asked to have my car brought to the front, because of the no client in back policy, the reception looked at me blankly.  Had to give them all my car information again, even though I gave them a description of the car.  (15 min lost)

Will never use their services again.<//text>< pics>

< Review>
Meh, parts guy was able to help me with the fluids I needed but dealerships are not really where I go unless something is under warranty to expensive for work done by people making $20-30 an hour but the business charges you over $120/hr. Feels dishonest.</Review>

<Review>What can I say?  Glad I got my car from Peter Pan BMW and the staff at the service location in Millbrae is all nice too.  I like their service and enjoy working with them, I would never go to another BMW dealership or service location.  Excellent service.  This is the place to come to if you want to be a BMW owner.  I enjoy working with my service advisor, Kenny Lew.  He is your best guy, nice and superb service.  He is always helpful.  He finds time to help out on emergency situations like this past weekend.  On regular needs, I always make sure Kenny has availability when I need to schedule a service for my car.  Also Michelle Gladieux at the front desk is a sweetie, friendly and all smiles making the service a great experience..< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<text>Avoid this place if you can.  5 minutes there to get my brake pads changed and they tried to up sell me on several maintenance items I didn't need/had already done myself, and then lied about it being illegal to change brake pads without also changing the rotor...  not an honest shop in my opinion.<//text>< pictures>

< Review>
I took my car to the Service facility like I have since I bought the car.
The check engine light was on and I could not get the car smoged.
I was told there were 4 items that would need to be fixed. The first three would cost around $1,500 but the third would probably cost $8,000 in labor alone.  The Car has 138,000 miles on it and I could not justify spending that kind of money repairing it when I could buy a used one for less than the repairs. The service person than asked if i would like to trade it in. I said no I already lease a brand new Jeep Grand Cherokee. I was bummed because I had taken care of the care impeccably and I had just put new tires on it. I did not want to give it to 1-877-cars for kids yet.  I then got lucky and a buddy told me about a guy in San Bruno with a business called The Shop and I reluctantly went there.  He said that the air flow problem they were talking about could be taken care of with some simple spray which cleared out the carbon buildup in the airflow unit.  He took three days and called me to come pick up my car and charged me $1,450 for everything. I got my car smoged and I am the happy owner of my old car. Should have been going to this guy all along.</Review>

<Text>Absolutely horrible services. They told me they would call me by 11 am with an update on my car, nobody called. Rude on the phone. No timelines given. Service "professional" not reachable by phone. Half a day after I dropped off my car and I still have no clue what they are doing and what the timeline is. 0 out of 10 points.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< username>

Peter Pan BMW's service department has now on three occasions exceeded any expectations I'd normally have when it comes to service. They speak openly, friendly and treat me like someone who's actually valued. Their main Receptionist (blonde hair, sorry I don't remember her name) is one of the nicest people you could ever meet, she has excellent customer service skills and has a rare, genuine kindness that is hard to find nowadays. Nobody likes having to carve out time in their day to get their car serviced and I bet she has to deal with quite a few cranky, unhappy customers, but she comes across as someone who really likes what she does and she tries to make everyone's experience a bit better. Little things, like when asking how your day is, she's making eye contact and you can definitely tell she's being real, not just repeating the usual lines. I'm greeted the moment my feet cross thru the doorway.

I've had the Assistant Service Manager, Steve, personally help me each time I've brought my car in, and the guy couldn't be any better. He's a car enthusiast and also treated me like my concerns mattered more to him than "business as usual". I like him a lot.

I've only had two minor issues with my car separate from one regularly scheduled maintenance service done there, but they're the only place I ever want to deal with. Good people!</text>

<text>Jordan is the best!!! By far the best experience I have had with BMW dealerships!!!. I have recently moved to the bay area and went to several places for my car services including both BMW dealerships and private BMW auto shop. By far, Jordan is the best!! Actually the best ever!!!!. Before I went to Peter Pan, I tried private BMW shop which was really close to my house and received 4-5 stars review. It was a bad experience. They didn't seem to care to take care of me. They are just a mechanic robot who did what they were told. After paying 2K for my routine service, my car started to shake a lot. I went back to the shop and the shop just kept saying they didn't do anything and had no clue why my car shaked....seriously?  After less than a month of service and 2K charging, just saying they didn't do anything and didn't check those stuff??? I decided to come to Peter Pan and got Jordan as my advisor by chance. She is by far the best service advisor ever even she is a woman! All the men at the auto shop just said they had no clue . They needed computer diagnosis and nothing was wrong. However, Jordan got it right on just only talking with me. She is very knowledgeable and attentive to customer. She was willing to work with me when I said how much I have paid for car maintenance. Looking for all the options possible to save me money. At the end, she figured that my car is SULEV which I didn't even know after owning this car for years and there is a special warranty with it!! She saved me over 2K!!! Even offer to reimburse part of my money at the private auto shop if it was cover by warranty. My car runs smooth again with BMW power. No more shaking! I would totally recommend Jordan and I will start asking for specific advisor from now</text>< Pictures>

Where was this diagnostic months ago when the people working on my car were very clear in telling me I had warped, defective rotors? Ended up paying full price. Loaner vehicle during service time was filthy and filled with trash, and having a dealer sticker on the loaner feels tacky.

<Text>Since my car was purchased from Peter Pan, I use their service center for my service needs. The cashier and service technicians are professional, knowledgeable, and helpful. The work done has always been as promised. The waiting area is spacious and comfortable, with free wi-fi, waters, and small snacks (and a vending machine). There are also clean restrooms just off the waiting area. I've also stopped in without an appointment on multiple occasions (usually when an indicator light comes on) and they have always accommodated me.</Text><resp>None< /resp><user_name>Marie T Fisher</user_name>< user_id>

<Review>Peter Pan BMW service Department, you suck, trying to charge me about $600 additional for regular service for a 2015 car in the warranty program which I already paid for. Your service advisor also threatened me if the fact of the past due service is disclosed to BMW , BMW may replace the engine etc. at my cost. Now I came to East Bay BMW, they have taken care of the maintainance right away with a great kind service in a professional way.
I will never be a Peter Pan BMW patron again and never refer this PPBMW to anyone else.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

< review>
I have wasted hrs of my day trying to schedule a service.  Called at 9am, used call back function with no call back.  Now called 4 times in the afternoon, I was hung up on/dropped off hold 3 times, and waited for over 20 mins with no service.

Can't answer the phone, can't work on my car.  Headed to another service center in the sf bay.....<//review>

<Review>Make sure you take pictures before you bring your car in there.  Also take your time and check your car before you leave.  Close up and sideways.  Quadruple check that they don’t smash your car before you leave.<//Review>< Pictures>

October 2016 First time at Peterpan BMW at Burlingame.

The facility was very nice... The staff was pleasantly kind and courteous, My service advisor (Ian) is outstanding, knowledgeable and honest.

With the right service advisor Ian.,  you can leave your new or old Beemer with great confidence that there Superb and Skillfully & Well-trained Mechanic's at Peter Pan Bmw will make your Beemer be the Ultimate Driving Machine once again... No doubt!!!

I scheduled my 2003 E39 for Driver's Air Bag Module (Recalled).  And the rest of my need to get done... Front brake, left taillight, hood shocks, and the 3rd brake and reverse light.

So, after a back and fort communication with Ian.  About the part's and labor.  Ian advice me that the air bag module would need to be ordered and might need to be re-scheduled some other time due to a waiting list. I said no worries.

So, I pick the car up on scheduled and all the work that need to be done is finished.

I am Extremely happy and satisfied!!! Thank you very much to my awesome and knowledgeable Service Advisor Ian,  You're Superb and Skillfull Mechanic's put my car we're it belongs...On the road again!!!

I recommend and rate PETER PAN BMW AT BURLINGAME 5STARS all day everyday...

Thanks
Les L.<//text>

Excellent. Very Professional.
Roel Vela and his team took good care of me and my BMW.
Setting up an appt. over the phone was easy. I was able to drop my BMW the next day and got a shuttle to the nearest Starbucks. Got a call from Roel about a software download issue which would cause them to keep the car overnight and urging me to pickup a loaner, which I did. The loaner was an excellent car, almost made me want to buy that next. Next am, got a voicemail from Roel telling me my car was ready for pickup. I drove in the loaner, and under 15 minutes, drove away with my BMW, which hasn't complained about anything yet. In all, I had a great experience, and would recommend Peter Pan BMW to anyone.<//Text>

Absolutely hate this dealer. My BMW broke down. They refused to even get a tech to look at it and determine what's wrong with the car unless I wanted to wait till the next day when I stressed to them I live far away and I can't wait till tomorrow. Worst BMW dealer and worst car ever.<//Text>

I've been here twice and its not the most welcoming dealership. They act like they are bored or busy, don't greet you, don't tell you it will be a minute. You all but have to interrupt someone just to talk to anyone.<//Review>

Terrible service! They dare to charge $299 only for updating the navigation map. While other dealers can update it for free. Besides, they insist making appointment for every service and they don't accept walk-in. They are the most terrible dealer I have ever seen!</review>

<Text>I've been going here since the early 90s. They've always cut  my hair perfectly, no complaints.

But today I went in for my monthly trim and I find out that Mars and his wife contracted Covid and is in ICU. Of all the viejitos in Riverside, I really hope Mars gets through this. He's been a great guy and the best damn barber I've ever had.

Edit: I just found out that Mars has passed away on Thanksgiving morning. RIP, man. At least they'll had good haircuts in heaven.< /Text>< gmapID>

They are on an appointment only so either give them a call or use their website to book a date and time. They will not disappoint you whether it’s for an adult or kids haircut and I am sure the rest of the barbers are extremely competent as well.< /Review>< user_name>

I'll be honest, the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars is for the shop itself, the atmosphere, a nice vintage vibe with a lot of cool pictures, antiques, and airplanes made of soda cans... All that's fine and dandy but the cuts themselves are mediocre. At least from the heavyset gentleman with the long black hair, his name escapes me at the moment, then again I don't think I ever even got his name as he doesn't speak. Not to me anyways.... He has messed my hair up more than once, facial hair as well.

Still, this is a go-to shop if your on a budget and need a quick cut. The wait is not long at all, in fact pretty fast service, and cheap. You get what you pay for.<//review>

< Review>
Great place with a lot of history. A real old school kind of place.This is the kind of place all men should get their hair cut.

Skillfull and no BS. No pushing to buy anything and I can gaurantee this is the coolest place you've ever had a fade.

Cash Only but there is a store across the street with an ATM. This place has my business from now on.</Review>

<Review>I have usually tried to purchase/rent my books from here since I like to support the school, but in the last 2 years (even before the COVID restrictions) it just seems more and more like they don't care about their patrons. And now you can schedule time to have curbside pick ups if you are BUYING stuff but returning rentals MUST be mailed? What is the difference? Very frustrating<//Review>< pics>

Small bookstore at the university. Not much there but the basics. Books, supplies, school memorabilia, there is a limited supply of computers. They only carry apple products on-site. No Microsoft or Google products although you can order other products through the book store website. There is a Target store, an office supply store, a hardware store nearby if toy can't find what you need. It's definitely the basics.</review>

This place is great. Has everything you need for school. But also has a small selection of Apple accessories, which I needed a mag power adapter. They had one. Very clutch.</review>

<Review>Book store on campus at University if La Verne. They have everything you need from textbooks, notebooks, pens, pencils, backpacks and a great selection of Leo gear
They have polo shirts for Dad.
Hoodies, crew necks, t shirts, girls t shirts, all in various designs.
Helpful staff.
Come in today and get yourself some cool University of La Verne gear to show your school spirit!< /Review>< pics>

Overall good, but I wanted to buy a backpack once hoping to find one with the la verne logo but they didn't have any. Another time I had a question about a scantron which the cashier couldn't answer and had a bad attitude when I suggested a solution. Book rentals are good, good service. I also suggest having more la verne products like patches and stickers. If you have them they are very hard to see.<//Review>

<Review>⚜️Big Time 5⭐️ This place is awesome the Ladies at the front desk were very nice to everyone there. Handy Cap Ramps, and  Entrance for Ambulances, are accessible easily, and the Security there is on top of things. Waiting area very comfortable, I Like it👌👍⚜️ Caring for Everyone 👏⚜️

⚜️👨🏻‍⚕️ It was Pretty Amazing to hear my Babie’s heart with the Doppler Heart Reading Aparatus the Doctor had in his hand.♥️🍼🍼🍼👨🏻‍⚕️⚜️

⚜️👩🏼‍⚕️ Medical assistants are Bilingual and their Translation was on point I was checking it out to see if they were actually Translating or Transliterating, but to my surprise their Translation skills are superb🥇🏆🥇🏆👍👌👍✍️👈⚜️

⚜️If you are near this Clinic and have the need to go  to one where you would feel treated with great Respect, I definitely recommend coming in here. This is by far a place of great Dignity and worthy of Respect⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👍👌👏⚜️❤️🤝⚜️👨‍🔬👩‍🔬👩‍🔬👩‍🔬👨‍🔬👨‍🔬👩‍🔬🏆🥇🏆🏥🏥🏥</Review><Rate>5< /Rate><date>1555119533962</date>< GmapID>

Disappointed to the point, I refuse to see another doctor. I had to wait a month to get lab results. They focused more about my weight. They were only caring more about the Hispanic patients. If you’re overweight, expect bias. If you’re not Hispanic, expect bias.</Review>

Lots of great visits here for my family. Dr. Jay is great with my kids. I've been coming for years and yes have experienced some rude Doctors unfortunately but I've experienced rude Doctors in other places too. I continue to come for the positive services I receive. Staff has always been nice and welcoming. Even have recommended other family members for services here.< /Review>

<Text>Could be better Drs. I went in today per the Drs request. I have been dealing with chronic pain and severe anxiety since 2003. Unfortunately because I am on Medi-Cal I don't get the same level of care as many other people. Overall I give this clinic and my primary Dr 3 stars. I understand their hands are tied and there's protocols to follow but one of my concerns I have been voicing vehemently for one yr now.</Text>< userid>

< Review>
I was really impressed with my first visit to this office and the doctor was very nice and attentive. That's where it ended. I have been waiting to hear about Physical Therapy for 3 weeks. I have called 8 or more times only to be told "I can forward the message" each time.
One person called me back after the first time I called and all that was left in the vm was "please call me back." I have heard NOTHING since then. My condition is getting worse because I am not in Physical Therapy. And I 100% blame these doctors because they can't make a simple 2 min phone call. I would even come in for an appointment if I thought it would get them to tell me what I need to know. I will be promptly changing doctors. Dr. Chandra is very nice in person but she is obviously overloaded if she doesn't have 2 minutes to call or time to delegate for someone to call me with the information I've been waiting for. They clearly don't know the meaning of "follow-up patient care."</Review>

Will schedule wrong type of appointments. Waited 2 months for the next available appointment so I could get my medication when I arrive im told my doctor cancelled many days ago and I wasnt called or notified so they fit me in because of their mistake. the one doctor i do see addressed none of my concerns and she just writes me down for another appointment with a specialist 1 month later.  When I got into my car I realised I had told them I wanted appointment with a specialist when i scheduled it in the first place. what a waste of time this place is i called another place and got a appointment 2 days from now
What took 2 months here took 2 days at another place<//text>

Mental health referred these guys to me so i could get some counseling for depression. I met with a counselor by the name of Julisa. At first she was nice, and told me how to get food stamps and Medi_Cal. Three times they cancelled my appointments, the third time I was standing there at my scheduled appointment time. "Your appointment has been cancelled, we tried to call you but your phone has been disconnected". AND WHILE I WAS STANDING THERE, SHE CAME OUT TO GREET A PREGNANT HISPANIC. She seen me and didn't say a word to me. I knew it was over between us. So I asked for a different Dr. they gave me Dr. Howard. He would never shake my hand, and always looked at his clock. On my first visit he asked me how long have I had schizophrenia? So I went home and told my family and friends, "oh that's whats wrong with you"? was their reply. But my next visit he denied saying that to me, "you got something but I'm not sure". He taught me that I could turn the same food dish into Spanish or Italian just by adding basil or other ingredients to change the flavor! What a JOKE! So I quit going altogether.
But Gloria, the greeter at the front door, is a sweetheart!
I am going to miss Gloria!< /Review>< Pictures>

Thorough, caring professionals really went the extra mile to make sure they found out WHY my child was ill and to correct the problem instead of just treating the symptoms and calling it good. Dr. Mangondato was amazing. My child felt like someone really cared what was happening to them and wanted to help. Hands down, the best care in Stockton.</text>

I had an appointment today that I scheduled over a month ago but when I arrived they said my doctor is on maturity leave and lied about trying to call me. I never received any calls from them. Staffs seem unhappy being there. I'm going to be changing hospital<//review>

<Text>One of the worst medical places I've ever been to. Very rude and unprofessional employee's.  My time was wasted a number of times at this place all because their employees don't communicate with eachother.  I been waiting now for almost 4 months for the Dr's "assistant" to call me back to schedule an appt for surgery and nothing. Last time I received a call from her the assistant was very rude and had no class what so ever. They must not like their job that much by the way they treat their patients. I definitely will not be going back here.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

First of all i schedule appointment, and was given an appointment that was after 1 1/2 month which means after about 45 days, and then a day before the day of appointment (on 44th day after i scheduled appointment) i received a call from the channel medical center, and i was told that since doctor is going on vacation, we are re-scheduling your appointment for after 2 months, and that was seriously another 2 months. I was actually burned down when she was giving me dictation about rescheduling appointment. Anyways, i said OK although not satisfied internally and feeling completely broken inside for the kind of treatment i received, and when  I visited this place, my experience there was even more horrible. To me it seems as if the clinic was run by inexperienced assistants to doctors. My personal understanding was that there wasn't any experienced "MD (Doctor of Medicine)" was working there, and the person i met didn't even know how to spell correctly, so i thought the same moment i am not going to come back, never ever again. Hopefully this review will help people to understand. And i request the government to take notice of the situation, and regulate these clinics and urgent care centers. People's health does matter, and getting health care from inexperienced assistants to doctors is not the right way of getting treatment for health problems. These clinics without experienced practitioners seems more of a business, and less of a health care facility. I feel extremely sad after this situation.</Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It seems like a market when they pass you to take the blood pressure, the "doctor's assistants seem to be at home speaking loudly, laughing a lot. They don’t have any respect to the patients.

<Text>(Translated by Google) I am coming because I am pregnant but I do not recommend it at all there is a nurse named Linda and I attended 2 times and is very rude apart as he does not know what he does because I was changing my information for urine test. Anyway, the doctor does not look at you when you go is a nurse.

Just so impressed with Dr. Porter's care and personal interaction with children and parents alike. It says something when one's kids look forward to going to the dentist. :-) His staff is incredibly responsive to our needs as is he. Thank you for the many years of wonderful dental care.</review>

<Text>Dr.Porter is amazing.He makes the kids feel relaxed and comfortable about cleaning or work that need to be done.so they do not fear the dentist they are actually always so  excited to have a dentist appointment. Great at explaining and providing information to parents. I always recommend him to friends or family with kids and no one has had a bad experience.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

They are so friendly and gentle, and never force the kids to do anything. They get new toothbrushes and toys at the end, and it was over in 15 minutes! I love that we can all be in the room together and little brother can see how big brother does everything. Highly recommend them!<//Review>< date>

I brought my two kids (9 and 6) to see Dr. Porter to establish care and our first appointment was incredible! My 9-year-old has had a lot of work done on his teeth, in the past, so naturally has some fears and anxiety surrounding his dental care. Dr. Porter was so patient and accommodating, working within my son’s comfort zone. Dr. Porter really met him where he was, and made the experience a positive one. I highly recommend Dr. Porter to any family who has children who may be a little (or a lot!) weary of the dentist. To say the least, I think our family has found a lifetime DDS!< /review>

My daughter was sooo very excited that she no longer has cavities! Dr. Porter is the most involved dentist i have ever met. He ensures the kids involvement by sharing xrays with my kids and lets the kids ask questions too...as a nurse who loves to educate...his policy of involving the kids and NOT talking down to them is just what my kids needed to become more involved in there own care!<//text>

<review>The staff and Dr. Porter are always so sweet and accommodating. My kid is always excited to see Dr. Porter. Now with the impacts of COVID, the office feels super safe. And Dr. Porter meets with parents and is super thorough in discussing next steps and treatment plans, which is always appreciated. I highly recommend this practice.< /review>< user_id>

<review>They are so amazing!! From front desk to hygienist/assistant to Dr. Porter himself, they make me feel welcome and my daughter (almost 4 years old and scared of going) feel comfortable and brave and by the end she is smiling every time. Her appointment this time happened to be close to her birthday and they gave her a birthday gift of multiple small goodies in a bag they had already put together for her. They are so thoughtful!! When she mentioned she loves her dog, they added some puppy stickers immediately. My daughter was beaming and chattering all the way home about it; she was so excited. She even wanted to call them to say thank you! Dr. Porter never makes me feel like I'm a failure when I admit that we struggle with teeth routines, he always is so understanding and encouraging. He is always concerned first and foremost about my daughter and her comfort level. He never gives her a hard time when she wants to sit in my lap and always adapts (she has yet to sit on her own in the chair, but she will soon I'm sure, because of how brave they make her feel). If I could give more stars I would in a heartbeat.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>DDS Brent Porter was absolutely amazing. My poor little lily who is 16 months old slipped and fell so hard on her front teeth and i immediately was looking for a great pediatric dentist who could see her asap. He was referred to me by my teacher. He called me shortly after i left a message on his emergency line and was able to see my little lily the next day. Even with his busy schedule his amazing staff got her in!!! Thanks again for being such a great dentist and having amazing staff. ❤ my little lily will be going there from now on for all her dental needs.</Review>< user_name>

This dental office has really good reviews, so obviously my bad experience must not be common.
The front staff gossips and ignores you ( like many front offices) The office smells like a strong floral fragrance covering cigarette smell, the room is tiny and dark where they.help the patients, they have called  4 times in 3 weeks harassing me since that day. They are now blocked. They rushed us, which was a first appointment, and I got a very very strange vibe there. I've been to 3 other dental offices in town,  born here so lots of experience, Dr Matasovich, Daly and Capitola dental I recommend. This place I do not. However my experience is just mine. They just seemed off ,the whole visit just seemed like a rushed bad vibe.< /Text>

Fantastic first visit with my 4 year old. All the staff were very friendly, professional and knew just how to put my son at ease. The whole office was really clean and themed out in such a fun design, my son loved looking at everything in the lobby (kept him entertained while I filled out paperwork). Already looking forward to our next visit to Dr. Porter's office.< /review>

My 4 year old and 20 month old both had appointments with Dr. Porter this week and it was a fabulous experience! With the current situation the staff is taking many precautions to insure everyone’s safety. Our hygienist was so friendly and gentle with both kiddos and Dr. Porter is friendly, knowledgeable and encouraging. It was my daughters first dental appointment & she was sent home with a bag filled full of tooth inspired surprises. Overall great experience. I highly recommend Dr. Porter and staff.< /text>

<review>Brent Porter is without a doubt one of the most gentile, talented, hard working dentists in the country. Not only does he provide an incredibly painless form of Solea laser based treatment for his patients, but he also goes the extra mile to explain what he is doing as he works as well as why. His treatments are all preventative so that cavities do not grow to where they absolutely need to be filled and he is very honest and fair about his recommendations. If I could give Dr. Porter 7 stars I would in a heart beat.<//review>< resp>

Dr. Porter and the staff were amazing, knew how to take care of children, made my kids and me comfortable, and were very professional. I was a little nervous bringing all my four children in together- but they had a family room that made the appointment run smoothly and put us at ease. They gave the kids lots of gifts and age appropriate education. My five year old son said the office was better than Disneyland and my seven year old son said Dr. Porter was so nice that he would like to have him over for dinner sometime - so there you go!<//review>

My 8 yr old daughter Audrey went into the appointment today alone, due to Covid restrictions. This was her first appointment without a parent in the room with her. When I asked her if the appointment with Dr. Porter was good, she replied, “ It was more than good, it was great!”
My daughter is shy with adults, but she is very comfortable with Dr. Porter. He is so kind and patient with her. We love Dr. Porter!!</text>

<Review>5 full stars always, for Dr. Brent Porter and his entire staff of Dental Hygenists and gals at the front desk!  My boys love their trips to the dentist!  Everyone is always so welcoming, warm, professional, and they make the experience of going to the dentist FUN.  Dr. Porter treats the kids with respect and includes them in all conversations of their teeth cleanings and X-ray results.  I always appreciate how the appointments are always on time and we never feel rushed during the time in the chair.  Dr. Porter and staff always go the extra mile and make us feel part of the family.  I would never hesitate to recommend him to friends in the community.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>Dr. Porter and staff have turned the office into a safe space.  Patients are met outside the door by staff in PPE for temperature checks and to complete a short questionnaire.  There is an air filtering machine and the door is wide open allowing air to flow through the waiting room.  Signs mark off socially distanced seating.  I felt very safe allowing my child to have her appointment.  Dr. Porter and his staff's attention to the health and safety of their patients exceeds all expectations. Great job!<//review><user>115007822376407706687< /user></record>

Dr. Porter has provided dental care for my son for over 10 years and we would never go anywhere else. He provides excellent care and has top of the line equipment not available at most dentists’ offices. My son just got his first cavity and Dr. Porter used a new CO2 laser to treat the cavity. My son did not feel anything at all- no pain! Dr. Porter has the advantage of also being an orthodontist so we have him provide our son’s orthodontics work as well.< /Text>

<review>My kids have been patients at Dr Porter’s office since they got their first teeth. We have always been very happy with the care we have received, but were a little nervous about going to any doctor’s offices during the pandemic. They were very thorough with screening and careful to follow all of the safety protocols, without being weird. My kids knew that it would be different going to the dentist but they felt comfortable and safe as always with Dr Porter. But they did miss the legos and trains and books that used to be in the waiting room!< /review>< pics>

My 4 year old grandson has had 2 visits with Dr. Porter.  I was so impressed with the one to one contact between Alex and Dr. Porter. Alex was completely at ease in the office, and I feel very strongly that was due to Dr. Porter's very friendly and dynamic personality.  We look forward to many more years with Dr. Porter and his terrific staff.

De. porter and his team have been a part of our family for over 15 years.  From Bi-annual check-ups, orthodontia, wisdom teeth extraction to making room for “Big Girl” Teeth they take care of us.  During COVID-19 they are extra careful with their pre-Screening/temp taking of patient and parents.  Everyone in the office is following all guidelines and make sure we are safe.  Their priority is to be safe, caring, loving, honest and make every patient and parent feel important in their office.  We LOVE Dr. Porter and his team and wouldn’t want ANYONE else.< /review>

The staff was very friendly and taking every precaution during this Covid 19 period to be safe and to keep the families who come to Dr. Porter well. The visit was efficient and the kids always feel comfortable and welcomed here. Dr. Porter offers his suggestions and advice but is never pushy about treatment. An over all GREAT experience!<//Text>

<time>1593717883311<//time><Review>My two boys, 3 and 5, love coming to Dr. Porter's office! Even with the newest COVID regulations (no train in the waiting room) the staff is friendly and makes us all feel comfortable. The kids are never forced to take X-rays or do anything they're not comfortable with, and the hygienists take their time and really interact with each kid. Dr. Porter is always positive with feedback and suggestions. And of course, they love getting their "goodie bags" with new toothbrushes and toys!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Dr Porter has been amazing with my daughter since 2014. He has made her so comfortable about going to the dentist by herself. She takes care of her teeth and he is very informative with me! I could not have asked for a better dentist for my little girl! 💕< /review>

Needed my five-year old with sudden and severe tooth pain seen ASAP,  and even though she wasn’t even a patient of theirs, Dr. Porter and his team saw her the same day, immediately made her feel safe and happy, and we had a treatment plan ready to go by the end of the visit. This all happened within three hours of my initial phone call to the office.  Highly recommend!<//Text>

<Review>We love Doctor Porter and his team...and most importantly my daughter feels so comfortable when she’s there and excitedly looks forward to every appointment - which speaks volumes for a dentist! He’s incredibly thoughtful and explains everything clearly. My daughter had her front teeth extracted at 18 months which could be an incredibly traumatic experience but Dr Porter, his staff and the anesthesiologist were wonderful. The waiting room is set up for kids and 7am appointments during the school year make it super flexible and accommodating for not impacting school. We are very grateful for a wonder local pediatric dentist!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Dr. Porter, is an extremely professional, ethical and caring Pediatric Dentist. My children have been seeing Dr. Porter for the past four years. They enjoy coming to the office. The office staff is very friendly and professional. The office is very clean and organized. I have a child with special needs that Dr. Porter has gone above and beyond treating him with kindness and making him feel comfortable at the office. My son had a lot of needed dental work when we originally came to the office. Dr. Porter completed all the necessary dental work.  My son now has braces and is doing amazing. I have had the great pleasure of seeing Dr. Porter and his family outside of the office at mutual kids event. He is an amazing Father and member of the Santa Cruz community. I highly recommend Dr. Porter and his staff. Sincerely, Nicole</Review>

Dr. Porter is such a patient, family-friendly dentist, and we trust him completely with the dental and orthodontic care of our two sons. Our eldest is about to start on braces, and I don't believe he could be in better hands. What a relief it is to us as his parents to know we have Dr. Porter walking alongside us.< /review>

< review>
I had a very negative experience with Dr. Porter. I know he is highly rated, I am sure he is an excellent dentist.

My situation is unusual and difficult to navigate. I share custody of my son, and the relationship between his father and I has just always been so difficult. I didn’t meet Dr. Porter until after he’d developed a strong relationship with my child’s dad, and I don’t know what was said about me, and I cannot blame Dr. Porter completely, but his manner and tone to me was so intimidating and unfriendly that I actually developed anxiety, and my son did as well.

In fact, my child started sobbing and would not sit in the chair. I had his baby brother with me as well, and I’d had no idea my son was going to be so anxious and upset he would not be able to cooperate with Dr. Porter, but Icould not devote myself completely to comforting and soothing him because I had my younger son with me as well, and Dr. Porter really just made me feel awful, in a situation that is inherently awful for everyone already.

I take my son to doctor’s appointments all the time, and I have never ever seen him be complete inconsolable, even when he got vaccinations.

According to Dr. Porter, he did not have this problem when he was with his dad, so I respect that. Maybe my son senses that his dad is comfortable with Dr. Porter, and that helped him feel comfortable. Indeed, my son’s dad seems to love Dr. Porter.

Either way, I love my son more than anything, and these kinds of situations are inherently painful, and it hurts even more when others who must deal with both of us seem not to remain neutral, which is what I feel happened here.

I am sure he is a fantastic clinician, and I think he did very well with my son’s teeth.  I wouldn’t discourage anyone from visiting Dr. Porter, but in my case, I believe my son will feel more secure with a practitioner who seems to have a professional level of compassion for the caregiver who is responsible for a given appointment. I think at least neutrality would be indicated here.

For this reason, when next I am taking my son to the dentist, I will exercise my right to take him to a dentist with whom I can build a rapport that will not be affected by the challenges inherent in having to align so many different motivations and personalities.<//review>

I agree with her on all of the above & recently appreciate the text msg. reminders ++ billing is easy & if follow-up payments occur due to insurance everything is easy, professional efficient to deal with-Paula is getting off to a great start with her teeth & dental health. Thanks.</review>< userid>

I have 3 children who have been treated by Dr Porter for 20 years.  He is a pro-active dentist; which, clearly, offends some people on this board.  He has been nothing but respectful, kind, flexible, and generous.  At times, he has HAD to be straightforward with my wife and I about staying in front of dental issues that might have been worse, otherwise.  Was he stern at times, forcing us to make quality choices?  Yes.  But, with great purpose of keeping my children's dental health in place; not just at the time, but for their future!  Now that most of my kids are grown, I repspect his choices, and have nothing but fondness for his care for my children, who's mouths are in excellent health because of those traits!  As opposed to many other pediatric dentists in town who take a, supposedly, more conservative approach, because they are not "permanent" teeth.

I would highly recommend Dr Porter for the LONG-TERM dental health of your child.  Are some things costly? Yes. But, what is worse?  Short-term costs, or long term issues for your kids as they become adults?

High regards!< /text>

We love Dr. Porter and all his staff! My son is disappointed whenever we have to go to any other medical office. Great toys in the lobby, everyone makes the experience fun, friendly, and not scary at all. Highly recommend.</text>

Worst kids dentist in the area period,,, AVOID avoid avoid,,,, BY FAR THE worst dentist,, His fillings ALWAYS  kept falling out  in regards to our 5 kids,and we had to return to have them glued in again,, ALWAYS<<<, We had several kids go to him since he came to sc in the 90s,, And I have to say STAY AWAY!
His work is second class, his diagnosis is Pretty much WRONG as we found out when we left,, He will tell you ALL these things he needs to do,$$$$ >> and constantly calls to get you in for treatment,, As a 55 year local with over 12 local relatives,,, As a local, I say AVOID THIS scam artist,, he is so full of crap at your cost, and your kids deserve better,,,ALso I always had allergy issues after visiting him with our kids,, MOLD issues in the walls I assume... I hope its not black mold!!  I really wanted to give a -3, but could not..  Go back to where you came from Doc,,, Your NOT welcome here!!!!< /Text>

Kids couldn't wait to see Dr. Porter. They reminded me they needed an appointment and were bouncing off the walls with glee when I picked them up from school to bring them in. And they took Dr. Porter's and his hygienist's advice to heart that night the oldest asked her father to floss her back teeth for her and the youngest showed off how she brushed her gum line.< /review>

Perfect and honest service from Shaw's. I have a older unit and was expecting the tech to try and upsell me on repairs or something else. All I received was honest service. My unit just needed some general maintenance. If you could request a specific tech. to come out to your home I would Highly recommend Max. After speaking to him I forgot he was my AC technician. His customer service is 10/10. Give Max a raise!<//text>

Jorge is an honest and personable salesman.

He take time to explain the product in detail and answered all of our questions.

We trust his opinion and know that he is available to answer all questions.

We currently have a mini split system he installed earlier this year. We love the unit and it works so efficiently.

We strongly recommend working with Jorge.

Feel free to contact us and take a look at the mini split system installed.

It's great to spend money and work with someone you trust who treats you like family.<//review>

<review>From planning, install, and a year later, maintenance. These guys are knowledgeable, polite, and their prices are reasonable. You could pay less, but if you want a complete and professional install and service, go with Shaw’s. I had my system replaced by them last year and just had it serviced by them. Max, my service technician was very knowledgeable and polite, he made sure I knew what to look for to make sure the system was operating properly and verified that it was. Thanks Shaw’s!<//review></record></dataset><record>

The technician who came out and repaired our AC unit was very knowledgeable and had great customer service skills. He got our home cooling down right away. We are extremely pleased with his service and are grateful that he was able to come out to our home after hours. I definitely recommend Shaw’s for problems with AC system.< /Review>

<Review>The entire team was very helpful and knowledgeable about what they were doing and on how to help even someone who doesn’t know anything get up to speed.  They showed up on time if not early and got in did what they needed to do and got out as quickly as they could ans I couldn’t be more happy with how everything turned out from the equipment to the services provided I would and will highly recommend them to anyone who asks or is seeking assistance.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

The lady/ladies in the office are kind, accommodating and fantastic to work with. The service men are great too! Today Max did the maintenance work and he is super kind and friendly!

< Review>
Max was awesome! Always service my system to keep it at its optimum performance! I try to keep it running & serviced correctly! Units are very PRICEY so maintaining them is KEY! On 12/28/2020 Jacob installed a new heater blower fan. He did a good job. My only concern was it happened just 3 WEEKS after my annual heater checkup. I'm trying to take care of my heating and cooling units to AVOID these expensive repairs. But I guess not. "The ounce of prevention rule" does not apply...... Oh well.</Review>

<Date>1499385676198<//Date><rating>5<//rating><text>We had some trouble with our AC the beginning of June and I called Shaw's and they immediately sent out a tech.  He took care of the problem.  Weather was cool, so we did not use the AC immediately.  We then started the AC and it began blowing cool air, but not enough to bring down our AC lower than 83 degrees.  I contacted Shaw's after hours and they immediately came out to figure out what the problem was.  It turns out that our AC was not blowing sufficient cool air to take bring down our AC from 85 degrees.   While we were trying to decide what action to take, one night I woke up during the night because I smelled something burning.  My husband went outside to make sure that our AC was not on fire.  Turns out that our AC had finally gave out.  Our house was at 89 degrees inside and Shaw's came out and brought us a portable unit to use for free.  Luckily we had a service contract, so we only had to pay the regular service charge (no OT).  Every time thereafter we did not have to pay a service charge until they were able to figure out what the problem was.
Shaw's gave us an estimate, which included a new AC unit, new Duct work (orig duct work 1976), larger Air Vents (that allow more air to flow), Return Air Filter (sucks up the hot air and allows the circulation of cool air to flow) and the installation of a new Thermostat, Carbon Monoxide sensor/alarm, and Fire Alarms in all 3 bedrooms.  We also received 10 year Warranty on parts and labor, 2 year service plan.  They disposed of the old unit and all of the old ductwork, including the old unit.  Last time we had the AC replaced, we had to pay for the disposal of the unit.  Once installed (87 degrees inside/ 102 outside) it took the unit an hour to come down to 80 degrees.  After an 1 1/2 hrs it was at 75 degrees.  We are so happy with the choice that we made to go with Shaw's.  I recommend them to anyone who is in need of AC or Heating services.   We are very impressed with the professional service that we received from Shaw's staff - Karen, Jenny, Victor, Derek, Martin, Brian, Antonio, Angel, Hayden.< /text>< pics>

We own a service company as well.  We had a relative in Lemoore who we couldn't get to right away.  Shaw's air came to the rescue.  Very reliable and professional.  My aunt is an elderly woman who can not be without heat and Shaw's air came to the rescue quick and and did not take advantage of the fact the she was a woman with no experience with heaters.< /text>

< Review>
When it’s hot the last thing anyone needs is their  A/C to stop working.  I found myself needing service and knew exactly what company to call.  When a company makes a excellent first impression they will always be who you suggest to other and always be your go to for service.   Within a day of making the call to Shaw’s I had an appointment for the next day.   I was impressed with the communication they use that alerts you via text letting you know of your appointment and when the technician was on the way.   The technician was very thorough with explaining what he was going to do before inspection and went through with pictures of the areas needing repair, the best part was everything was fixed on the spot.  Your employees are a reflection of your company, and it can be good or bad.  From my interaction with the technician (Max) you can tell he took pride in his job, that is an amazing work ethic!  Thank you Shaw’s for making customer service a priority, it shows in your employees interaction and overall knowledge.  Most importantly Thank you for continuing to keep us cool in the summer and warm in the winter!</Review>

<Review>Shaw's has the best customer service around. From the first phone call to schedule to the service technicians and all the way to the billing department. They are all first class and they care. Shopping local definitely pays off when it comes to Shaw's. When in doubt give them a call and let them show that they are different then other companies. Most of all they are honest and have a great value for the quality work they do. Thank you Shaw's keep up the great work.</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1590607844349, 'text': 'We definitely love what we do and our customers.

Had our ac unit cleaned & inspected this morning, our technician Max was super helpful & super nice! Loved the communication method they use; we were sent text reminders of our upcoming appointment & the morning of our appointment we were provided a text message letting us know technician was on his way that included a picture & brief bio of our technician. Keep rocking it Shaw’s Air!!<//Review>

<Review>I needed my unit looked at and called Shaw's. I got a same day appointment due to the fact my heater went out on me and my family. The technician who came out was James Charlton who did an amazing job. He was very friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. We went over different options on the issue with my unit. He was very easy to work with and thoroughly explained the different parts of the unit and what the issue was. He made sure to continue to check and recheck the unit till he figured out the issue. I highly recommend  Shaw's Air Conditioning & Heating and ask for James! Thank you!<//Review><user>109110225707170131408</user>< name>

Your service guy just left us.  Top notch!!  I think his name was Jeff.  A good dude who was very thorough and had great customer service skills.  He explained what he did, and did it in a very timely manner.  He wore his booties when he came in the house to make sure he didn't track anything in.  Once again, you and your employees are doing great things!< /Text>

<Review>Shaws has always been a pleasure to work with. My most recent appointment with Jacob Chieze was another example of of a positive experience with Shaws; Personable, timely, kind, and thorough. I have tried other servicing companies in the area in the past and there is a huge contrast between Shaws and the rest, in my experience, and Shaws is the only company I will recommend.

<pics>None< /pics><review>Once again, Shaw's Air Conditioning & Heating did an outstanding job. They had installed a new A/C Heat combo unit 16 months ago and did a fantastic job with the installation. The heater was kicking on and off so I called Shaw's this morning and they sent a technician out the same day. James Charlton was the tech and he was very friendly and knowable. Not only did he fix the problem but he did my winter maintenance on the unit at the same time. I can't say enough good things about Shaw's and their staff. Everyone I have talked to has been extremely friendly and professional. James did a fantastic job and was a pleasure to converse with. James is a great asset to Shaw's A/C.</review><time>1574383684448< /time><Name>J S< /Name></record></dataset><record>

Additionally, Tim provided excellent answers to all of my questions and HVAC system concerns.  Shaw’s Heating and Cooling remains an excellent value for the money we invest in periodic HVAC system maintenance. Thanks again Tim!   Also, Aubrey was simply awesome in working with my schedule to get this service done at a time that fit my schedule perfectly.  In a nutshell, Tim and Aubrey represent outstanding Customer service at Shaw’s.</Review>< Pics>

<text>I do take the blame on this as I probably should have said no to the service and researched the problem. But when there are temps of 108 and your AC goes out, you'd expect a company to not take advantage of the situation. They charged $400ish for a capacitor that is only $65, when asked if they had anything other than this "special" capacitor, they said no they don't and this is the only one they use. Then they charge a diagnostic fee of $89 which they don't even use to offset the cost if you decide to go on with the repair. Obscene upmarket charge and I feel that the tech lied when he said they don't carry a normal capacitor for my unit. But I have to keep my family cool during these hot times. Already submitted a review on BBB and a complaint.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>I have been using SHAW'S on and off for about 4 and a half years. After 1.5 years of not having service done (due to my own hardships) I called them back out. Jeff R. Was as expected... thorough, thoughtful and beyond professional. He not only Serviced my existing unit but signed me up once again for the yearly service, which served in my best interest!
I would/will continue to give my personal recommendation of Shaw's due to their continual maintenance without being "pushy" about products that I simply can not afford. Their family friendly approach, while explaining and truly helping me understand what may come to be expected is beyond reproach ! They are so "human"..
Jeff and the team... are all so warm, considerate and accommodating.
Thank you so much Shaw's!!<//review>< pics>

I have history in dealing with Shaw's in the business realm and was eager to have them help out with our AC/Heater replacement in our home.  Installation was on time, professional and courteous.  When the men left, the house was spotless as if no construction had even taken place.  I highly recommend Shaw's for whatever needs you have concerning AC/Htr.< /text>

Office staff was very helpful when I called regarding services despite me calling three times as I kept forgetting to ask something.  They give you a two hour service time window which is much nice than a four hour window.  They arrived pretty close to the start of the time frame and were very professional.  Brian took the time to explain the situation and my options.< /text>

We are very glad we found Shaw's heating and air. We called them to get a second opinion about our AC unit and they came out free of charge and inspected the unit. We then scheduled Victor to come out and give us a quote and Victor was the only one out of the many companies we called that noticed that the home warranty company installed the wrong compressor which is why our AC was not working. After being denied by the home warranty company for them to fix their mistake we decided to go with Shaw's to replace the whole unit. They were able to install the unit at the end of the week offered financing and during the install did a fantastic job. My neighbor was getting a new AC unit that same day as well and I'm proud to say Shaw's finished a few hours before them and cleaned up all the debris. The guys that came out were great very pleasant to work with and explained every step to me. Victor even replaced our vents to the correct vents we needed and installed an amazing thermostat. We are so happy we found Shaw's and love that fact that if we have any issues we can call them and they come by very professionally and we feel comfortable about having them in our home. Shaw's is a fantastic company that still treat there customers like family one thing that is hard to find with many companies we look forward to using Shaw's in the future.<//Text>

Brent was the technician again and I was notified via text that he was on his way. It came with a picture and a brief bio! Haha, that's fun. He came right at the beginning of the two hour scheduled time slot, so I really appreciate that. As always, he was very friendly and courteous and did the job well! Shaw's is great, thank you so much!

7/7/2020 update:
Max V. was the technician who came out today and he was very friendly, courteous, and made sure to answer all of my questions. He was thorough in his inspection and provided me with lots of information. Shaw's also sent me a reminder email for my semi-annual maintenance check-up which I really appreciated. You all are great, thanks again!

I have been a customer of Shaw's for a few years now and they are great in many ways. All of their technicians are knowledgeable and friendly. They also send reminder emails for service, which I appreciate.

Today Brent was awesome. He called me to let me know he was ahead of schedule and asked if he could come by early, which was great. He also identified and fixed a problem with my Nest thermostat which someone else had installed. Thank you so much Brent! He went above and beyond the standard service today and for that I will be a life-long customer of Shaw's.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Several weeks ago my ac stopped working :( Brian came out and gave me the bad news about a leak. I begged him to try and keep it going for just a little longer, so he did :) But we have known for a long time that it's time to replace the unit. Of course it died the hottest weekend of the summer! So we called Victor out to go over having it replaced. He was so nice and worked really hard to get it done as quickly as he could. Within the week Juan and Angel got it replaced for us. We have been living in a nice cool environment ever since! Also having fun with our new Ecobee thermostat :) We appreciate all of the staff and enjoy our working relationship. Cheers to Shaw's AC and Heating team! Thanks guys and gals :)<//review>

<name>Manuel Chagoyan< /name><Time>1579460517691</Time><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I had my HVAC unit replaced in November. The work was carefully planned out and completed. Shaw's worked around are schedule and we couldn't be happier.

We did have one small glitch when the Ecobee thermostat stopped functioning. I notified Shaw's and they surprised us with a same day visit. After testing the entire system, they determined it was only the thermostat and it was replaced.  We have been comfortable since then.

After getting quotes from other companies, we are glad we selected Shaw's</Review>< pics>

<rate>5< /rate><review>My A/C unit stopped working on a Sunday. I placed the service call through the AHS website, being sent to a company that couldn’t get to me until Friday. It’s triple digits in my location and I have a special needs child. Had to call AHS for assistance. They sent the service call to StandLee in Visalia which couldn’t help until Wednesday. They came out, spending 10 minutes to tell me what was wrong with it stating, “ . . .  it the fan motor which we have to go back to the shop to get. We will have to reschedule to come back out to bring the part to fix it. The receptionist will have to reschedule for another day because we have other service calls . . . “This was not acceptable due to my husband and I taking time off work to deal with this matter and had to make arrangements for my son’s care. My husband contacted a local company, Shaw’s A/C and heating, and they came out and fixed my unit the same day with such efficiency, paying attention to details. In regards to StandLee, I would not recommend them to anyone for any kind of service. I would highly recommend Shaw’s and will utilize them for future maintenance of my unit.<//review>< Pictures>

Our AC went out on Sunday and Shaw's AC was the only one who answered their phone and came out right away. Brent went right to work and got our AC working! He was very professional and knowledgeable. We will now continue to have our AC serviced by Shaw's AC & Heating.<//review>

AC unit old and not producing. Needless to say it was a hot beginning to our summer. Scheduled multiple companies to get an idea on pricing. Scheduled an appointment with Victor to determine whether Shaw's would be installing a whole new ac/heat unit. The appointment went very well. Victor was very knowledgeable and educated us on what type of system needed to ensure air flow along with power efficiency. Additionally, we reiterated the urgency, due to the triple digit heat. From beginning to end the process was only about a week. No one at this time of year could provide this service except Shaw's. Well done!!!! Our Family appreciated your work with professionalism and understanding our urgency. Thank you😀👍🏻< /Text>

Hired shaw's to investigate a possible leak. Found leak was in a bad spot. Sorry I dont remember the young guys name. Had a good head on his shoulders tho. Shaws sent out Victor to talk dollars. Decided to go with a replace over a fix. He found me a good deal. Unfortunately no vet discounts. Fellows came to install. They was like an hour late. The rest of the install was extremely nice. They were out shortly after 3pm.

All in all. Glad I saw a billboard.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>Shaw’s Air Conditioning & Heating did a superb job installing our new AC unit, along with our new solar panels on our home. They were efficient & knowledgeable in the product & they educated us how we would now be saving money in the long run. They’re employees were kind to our family when they were working & I can’t say enough good things about this company.< /review>< Pics>

Very nice experience with Shaw’s!  Right from the get go, Victor helped with providing us options on fixing our AC problems. Then the install team, Angel and Juan, did a great job with getting us up and running. Loved how they put down tarps to keep the house clean. Brandon helped out a ton by getting the portable AC units working that first evening when the main AC unit wasn’t quite ready. Thanks to all.< /review>

Very professional service that does great work.  They had some issues working out a timeline for the day of my service and showed up quite a bit late but made right of the issue with exceptional customer service.  The techs were very informative with the specifics of the my cooling system and informed me of the work they were doing and why.  Recommended.</Review>

<review>AC went out on a Friday called Shaws and had someone out to look at unit within 2 hours. Aside from needing to ship the part and it being a weekend unit was fixed by Tuesday. No.complaints. worked on our roof for multiple hours in 100+ degree weather without one single complaint. Enjoyed thier eagerness to fix the problem in a timely matter. Parts were under warranty labor was a bit pricey but that's as expected..<//review>< rating>

Brent was great. After an hour and a half and he still  couldn’t find the exact problem the owner JEFF came over and they both searched and found these (2) extremely small parts that were ruptured. 9 straight years I’ve had issues and I found someone who actually cared enough to ‘find’ the problem. My husband is disabled and can’t be in the heat and knowing this they continued their search! I will never go elsewhere they were so fast and professional and Lindsay in the office was so great! Local business is best! They will always have my business! Thank you Shaw’s! Honestly they were awesome...< /Review>

<Review>I did a little research on the web looking for a HVAC service company with good reviews.  I chose Shaw's mainly because of the professional website and positive reviews.

I'm always a little apprehensive about hiring contractor's so I emailed Shaw's.  I got a call and we agreed upon a diagnostic at a convenient time for me.

Their tech, Brian, called and showed up early.  He greeted us, put on his shoe covers, and looked at my thermostat.  He told me what he was going to do and quickly got to work.  He saw me outside while he was working and gave me a little info on what he was doing and his suspicion on what might be wrong.  He also gave me a tip on using the built-in AC filter as an option to the in-house duct filter. As we spoke, he gave me the option of signing up for their maintenance program, but he didn't push it.  He suggested how it could save money even on today's visit.

Shortly thereafter, he came down to test the AC unit via the thermostat and went up to do some additional work.  By this time I opted for the maintenance agreement and he took care of maintenance right after the repair.

We then looked over the charges, discussed my questions, and Brain took off.

I was pleased at the efficiency and straight-forward and friendly interaction.

Definitely recommended.< /Review>< Name>

When my Air Conditioning went out on a hot summer day,  I called Shaw's AC and Heating. Lindsey was very nice on the phone and gave me the soonest appointment they had, which fortunately was only two days away. Martin came out well within the given time. He explained what our unit needed and gave us two options to fix it. He fixed it that same day! Martin was friendly, efficient, and explained exactly what he would be doing. Choose Shaw's for your repair and maintence service!</review>

I have had Service with Shaw’s Air Conditioning for a few years.  Recently however, I request work be performed on two of my homes in Lemoore.  Well I received invoices and they had charged my card without my authorization.  When I called to ask about the two invoices and work supposedly an inspection that had been done for which I declined.  But the gal who I talked to went on to tell me that the technician had actually only gone to one house and never saw the other and that the charged amount on the two invoices was actually for only the one house they went to.  I never received a call to authorize the work or even a call to tell me how much the charges were.  But I can’t believe they charged for both the houses and only did work on one, the gal said it was a mistake, really??  This is fraudulent, beware of keeping your card on file with these people, they will automatically charge you for work you didn’t authorize and for work they didn’t do.  In the end they didn’t offer to refund me the unauthorized charge on the work they didn’t do on the one house.  I am going to talk to my credit card company about this as this is fraudulent to automatically charge without authorization.  The better business bureau will also be contacted.<//text>

<review>When our A/C went out they were very fast to come out and look at the problem first time couldn't figure it out call some other people same result. Call them back turns out it was to compressor that failed. They were very helpful in helping us get the correct size replacement for the house. They hooked us up with a portable unit for the family room. once everything came in it was installed fast. had solar panels installed also the first set went up quick took a little longer for the second set. they didn't pick up after them self from the roof job and a few tiles were broke in the processes. they are very hard to work with after the job is done. I am going on 12 months for the process from start to now.</review>< pics>

I received a mailer from Shaw’s Air Conditioning and Heating. After reading numerous glowing reviews I decided to give them a call. I am so glad that I called them. I have a large home with 2 A/C units. I wanted to replace the larger unit that serviced the first story of my home. Victor came to my house and explained the different options available to me. He was very knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. His quote for a new 4 ton, 16 seer, combo unit was over $2,000 less then a different companies’s estimate. After meeting with Victor I felt comfortable, and confident that Shaw’s was the right company for my needs. The install team of Angel, and Antonio came out first thing, on the morning of my appointment, and worked through the day fabricating and prepping a new base for the new Coleman A/C unit. They spent a few more hours on the next day prepping everything for the new unit, including a new gas line and new wiring. The job turned out to be more difficult then when we first looked at it but they did a phenomenal job with the installation. They even had to cut branches off of my trees in order to lift my old unit out and drop the new unit in by crane. They installed a new Ecobee4 WiFi, Alexa enabled thermostat with room sensors and by 2:30 of the second day, my new A/C unit was up and running. I couldn’t be happier with the new A/C unit. It is much more energy efficient then my 28 year old, 5 ton unit. I can not say enough good things about Shaw’s and their employees. I am so pleased with their quality of service and work. I am considering installing solar on my roof early next year and I am definitely going to have Shaw’s design and install the system. It was a very relaxed and unstressful experience from start to finish.<//Text>

Our technician arrived at the house, stayed on his phone for 30 minutes in the car, got out and worked for 45 minutes, and went back down to play with his phone for another 30 minutes. Terrible communication and poor work ethic--Shaw's AC in Lemoore has some of the worse technicians I've dealt with. It's 6:45pm and we're in 110 degree weather; I was assured the AC would be fixed around 1:30, after already having them show us late or not show up at all for the past 2 days. This is ridiculous...</Text>

My personal favorite is the veggie guacamole. Do try. They don't shy away from putting a lot of veggies and their sauces make it so tasty. The cost is a bit on a pricier side but I think it is worth it. Also try the milke chocolate cookie. It's very tasty as well.<//Text><rate>5<//rate><GmapID>0x808fc71e2d2b565d:0x158853e6afd33fad< /GmapID><name>chandrashekhar dashudu<//name>< date>

<username>Liz Pinto< /username><date>1602813519180</date><Rating>2<//Rating><Review>Had a pastrami swiss cheese on rosemary parmesan bread today. The sandwich was supposed to be a large, but was not very large. It  was cut in half so maybe be 5 inches per each half, not the 6 inches it should have been.  The bread was supposed to be a 12” size. The  meat was skimpy, 2 very thin slices of meat per each half. Was there swiss cheese in the sandwich, couldn’t tell!  This was sad to say the least. Disappointed is my opinion, very sad excuse for a sandwich. The bread tasted good, but I didn't want a sandwich of mainly bread!<//Review>< pictures>

<review>After being loyal customers for 2 years and ordering the same sandwiches weekly, todays experience with the owner made it easy for us to take our business elsewhere moving forward. So much for taking care of loyal repeat customers especially during the pandemic!< /review>< Name>

To be fair, that large sandwich fed me all day, but my husband can usually crush the large in a sitting. The honey bacon club is where it's at, even at it's top dollar price.< /review>< Pictures>

Friendly and clean but for the price it should be done right. DONT BE CHEAP if you want customers to return.</Text>< Pictures>

The store hours say 8am - 9pm
A worker kicked us out at 8:40pm saying to get our stuff and go to the front cause the store was CLOSED! I understand they wanna go home But the door clearly says open from 8am - 9pm so rude!<//Review>

Couldn't find an item of right size because of the poor organization. I gave up looking for it after 10 minutes looking at almost every shelf within the department.<//Review>

<Text>Horrible management, awful customer service and no matter what, their system is always down and everything they have on sale doesn't scan as sale price so I have to fight with the manager to get my discounted price they are never apparently aware of! They put up the damn sign how can your manager not be aware of the discounted price!</Text><user_name>Bree Bree< /user_name><user_id>109216754346768256506</user_id>< pictures>

Yes location is great, staff is nice.
But when the shower curtain is pink at the bottom, it needs to be replaced and cleaned for bacteria. Room 134.
Changes to the room should be mentioned on your website; "we have taken the coffee maker and hair dryer out of the room due to Covid".< /text>

{'time': 1619565318393, 'text': "Greetings Costa, While I am glad to read that you liked our location and that our staff was nice, I am disappointed that we let you down with the shower curtain.  That certainly is disconcerting.  I have asked our Housekeeping team to replace it as soon as the next guest has departed, if it hasn't already been done.  I am happy to report that we are getting ready to return the coffee maker, hair dryer, alarm clocks back in the rooms. I only hope that this doesn't discourage you from visiting Sequoia National Park in the future.\n\nKind regards,\nBrett Archer\nGeneral Manager"}<//response>

<rating>4</rating><Text>Great place to stay near the General Sherman tree. Check in was easy and our room was clean. I'd give this a 5/5, but the lodge restaurant hours I wish were posted on our reservation itinerary prior to arrival. We were disappointed after watching the sunset at Moro rock to find that our only option for food was their mac n cheese and left over salads since the restaurant was closed. I believe it closed at either 7 or 8pm. Just an important thing to remember if you stay here!!<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2Gxv3ajBHWyi4Nh_ymPGE0wYfiaukNl_hr255=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Our room was a dual queen bed (One for us and one for the kids) in the Silliman building, second floor. The room was comfortable enough and was well fitted for the getaway we were on. Cable TV and Wifi were provided, though don't expect to be able to stream movies at night with 1.5mbps download speeds.

The lodge is located only a couple miles from the Sherman Tree and Beetle rock, as well as the Sequoia Museum. The road from the southwest gate to the lodge is a fantastic journey of hairpin turns, incredible views from a height, and breathtaking cliffs without a guardrail for an hour. Fill up your tank before making the drive up!

The food is OK but nothing to write home about at the lodge, in fact, I would recommend to bring some snacks as everything is pricey. Which is to be somewhat expected being in the middle of the park.

The Arts & Crafts/Mission style of the lodge and cabins were very pleasing. Overall I had a very pleasant experience!</Review>

Convenient location in the park. We stayed 2 nights so we can visit both Kings Canyon and Sequoia park. We had wonderful experience without too much stress.<//review>

<Resp>{'time': 1618874888611, 'text': 'Greetings Vanessa,\nThank you for taking the time to post your review.  Please accept my apologies for how you were treated by the Front Desk.  It is always the expectation that all associates are gracious and friendly.  I am hoping you might be able to share some details about your visit such as when you stayed and what time you checked in so I can narrow down whom the associate was that registered you.  I would very much like to coach said associate on the finer points of hospitality.  I am disappointed to read that you decided to cancel a future trip this year because of this.  Again, thank you for sharing your experience and I am sorry for the way we made you feel.\n\nKind regards,\nBrett Archer\nGeneral Manager'}< /Resp><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rate>

<review>The area is beautiful. Unfortunately the lady at the desk was rude and seemed annoyed.  It was our first visit and we had a few questions that she answered with an attitude, really made us feel like we were bothering her.  . Not at all what I was expecting from this lodge.  We had planned a second trip for later this year with more family members but we decided against that after the treatment we received.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>There is no food options up there. The hotel itself has limited choices that are less than amazing. It’s a nice place to stay but bring plenty of your own good food to eat. There’s also no gas stations up there so make sure your tank is full before you head up. The staff was nice and it’s a very pretty especially in the winter.<//review>< date>

Clean, comfortable, rooms! All a girl could ask for especially, after the long, treacherous plight to get there. All I needed was WIFI that never seemed to work during my stay. Maybe God wanted me to relax and rest easily without distractions.</review>

I’ve never been one to put out a bad review, but the room I was assigned ... was horrible. The room had crumbs on the dressers, restroom had urine on the floor. Probably worse, but I walked out immediately. Brian at the front desk apologize and issued me another room. When I arrived there was someone already their doing a quality check. I would have left had it not been 11:30pm and my kids being tired.

DON’T RESERVE A ROOM!!!!

Go somewhere else.<//Review>

Lodge style hotel in a beautiful forest setting.  Yes the nightly rate is a bit high for the room/amenities you get but it's all about the location. Check in is in different location then rooms. Yes parking is away from rooms but it's not that far. The room was spacious, clean and the bed was comfortable. They welcome dogs too. Our room didn't have AC, even though it gets cool outside at night it's still warm inside. Ceiling fan helped. Very quiet at night. Free coffee in lobby in AM.< /review>

First time to Sequoia Nat'l Park and it's beyond beautiful up here. Wuksachi Lodge is right at the center of all the main attractions and trails so definitely 5 stars for location. There is a lot of signage so it was easy to find. Because the Lodge is in the middle of the forest you see a ton of wildlife without even trying which is fantastic. The only down side is that it's the only place with a restaurant in all of Sequoia Nat'l Forest I believe so you have to eat at the Waksuchi Lodge restaurant. The food is pricey but really good. I was pleasantly surprised at the options, portion size and quality of the meals. There's a mini fridge in the room so definitely bring your own drinks and snacks. You can find other food options at the town at the base of the mountain called Three Rivers but it's about an hour drive from Waksuchi through winding mountain roads so a pain to go just for lunch or dinner.  The staff is super friendly and welcoming and really love the diversity of guests staying here. We stayed in a two queen room and it's very spacious with a small table with 3 chairs, closet, bench by the door to take dirty boots/clothes off, and average size bathroom.<//Text>

<date>1603929600000< /date><rate>None<//rate><Review>Enjoyed our stay. We stayed in king room with Mountain View  and the room was very clean. We had an issue with the door lock to our room. We had just settled into our room when suddenly the door opened up and a women walked into our room and announced it was her room!  It was a bit disconcerting that she could open our door. Long story she was mixed up and she and her husband were staying in another room. We called the front desk and they sent out an engineer to fix our door lock which they did. The room was big and basic. Nothing fancy but perfectly fine for one night and given the setting in the forest it was magical. The staff could not have been nicer. Ordered pizza from the outdoor terrace and took back to our room as it was 35 degrees outside. Sequoia is a fantastic place to visit and if you want to be inside the park this is the place to be.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>Brett completely turned this trip around for my fiance and me! Our last three days had been nothing but a disaster traveling through out California and the closures throughout Sequoia due to snow looked like a continuation of the rest of our trip. The final. The final nail in the coffin was when every location was closed that could supply us with snow shoes for our back country hikes throughout the park, or at least that would have been the case if not for Brett. Brett went out of his way to leave the lodge and find us some snow shoes down at lodgepole market, which is 2 miles away on roads that require snow chains to even access them. This is the best customer service imaginable and an unheard of case of going above and beyond for a customer at your lodge.  We highly recommend you stay at the lodge and if your stay isn't absolutely perfect, you now know the man that can make is happen.</review>< pics>

Fantastic staff.  Really friendly and helpful.  Place was really clean.  We were there for about 13 hours so didn’t see much but what we did see was pretty cool.  Limited food choices but otherwise we really liked it and would definitely go back.</Review>

<Review>This is a lovely place to stay, it's in the middle of the forest, the rooms are a short walk -or ride- from the reception and restaurant. Due to health measures, only the exterior deck is available for dinning, but the pizza is excellent. I had the chance to watch a family of deer walking casually on the sidewalk.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Terrific stay at the Wuksachi. Everyone working there was wearing masks, plastic guards in place etc. Felt very safe considering the pandemic. John and Haley at the front desk were really wonderful, great sense of humor and very accommodating. We had book three separate room types across a few different platforms and were supposed to move every night. John and Haley worked hard to "merge" our reservations, ensuring we could stay in the same room for our entire stay. Food at the lodge was actually the best in the park IMO. Would 100% recommend staying here if you are visiting Sequoia Kings Canyon. It is also located very close to popular sights (Moro Rock, Crescent Meadow, General Sherman) and rooms are updated and comfortable.<//Review>

After arriving and during the checkin for our stay. Emily,  at the desk, informs us that for our safety during covid, they have removed coffee maker's from all rooms. To get coffee,  you walk from the motel rooms to parking lot, drive to parking lot for the Lodge and then walk into the lodge. When we got to our room we learned they had also removed hair dryers and alarm clocks, for our safety! We were never informed these included amenities would be excluded from our room.<//review>

Room and location are great!!!!!!! Bring your own cold food (no microwaves) to put in the mini fridge or cooler if you bring one because the food SUCKS and is over priced. The location is amazing though and we WILL stay here again. John at the front desk is the nicest man ever!!!!!<//Text>

Location was amazing.  Rooms are comfortable.  My issues that lowered my rating were check in with only one agent at the desk and the line out the door and the poor lighting in the parking lot and up to the buildings.  It was very difficult to find our building then to have to use a luggage cart on a poorly paved  walkway with no lights was very hard.  Come on.  I was with my partner and her parents.</review>

<review>We recently spent two nights at the Wuksachi Lodge in Sequoia National Park. This is the feature park lodge excellently located just a few miles from major sightseeing in the Giant Forest section of the park.

Reservation was made 6 months in advance directly through the park website. Email confirmation was received immediately. 4pm Check-in at the main lodge was very slow, around 30 minutes due to two sets of guest ahead of us in the queue. Hopefully they will learn to check in guests quicker in the future.

Lobby area is nice, includes seating near a stone fireplace. There is a gift shop on site as well as a restaurant called the Peak. We had dinner here one night, it was quite poor (see separate review) so we opted to not eat here the next day.

Rooms are found in 3 separate buildings around 400 metres from the lodge. There is a carpark below. You have take your luggage rather far to get into the building and then up to your rooms. Rooms were decent but not what you'd expect for the room rates normally.

Space was good, furnishing a bit dated and decor common. Bed comfort just ok. Room came with sitting sofa and chair, desk with chair, fridge, flat screen TV and enough closet space for most. Bathroom space was fine, shower water pressure a bit weak but plenty of warm water. We paid higher rate for a room with a view. Our room was a first floor room overlooking the carpark. That felt like a wasted spend.

Overall, you are paying for the location with Wuksachi Lodge. We very much appreciated being so close to the Giant Forest, allowing us to visit early in the morning before too many tourists overwhelmed the trails and sights. It was nice being able to return to the lodge for a bit of a rest before heading back out midday. Otherwise, we felt rather meh about the room considering the high rates and would probably opt to stay elsewhere and just drive in for sightseeing next time.< /review></record></dataset><record>
<gmapID>0x80955e7bbfa947a1:0x569f3289d86ec019< /gmapID><review>We were delighted with our accommodations at the Lodge and they certainly surpassed our expectations. So much so we could very readily have stayed longer than the one night we were booked in for.
The food was okay but nothing out of the ordinary. Service was largely perfunctory rather than accomplished but I imagine recruitment must be quite a challenge given the location. We visited in September and got the feeling that many staff are simply getting a bit people-weary.
The location is beautiful and we loved the drive both up and down the mountain.<//review>< user_id>

You gotta love Wuksachi Lodge. It's quiet and comfy in a superb setting. Even the restaurant is good. Trailheads start right from the Lodge. It's usual to see deer, chipmunks, and other wildlife as you walk from the rooms to the restaurant.<//Review>

The lodging and the location were great! The restaurant service was good! I didn’t really like the cheeseburger though! The bar service was super slow which definitely could be improved upon.</text>

Very good service the workers are kind and helpful. The rooms are nice, while I was here the TV's did not work, but the staff provided guests access to many board games, and there are many fun activities around the lodge. All the guests were really cheery making it a nice place to stay. If they had room service I would give it 5 stars, but in 15 feet of snow I understand not having it. Overall a good fun experience with my family.</review>

Are lunch on the deck. Everything was decent. I had the Caesar salad, which was packaged dressing and croutons, so nothing to write home about. The pizza was bigger than we expected and the whole family (for of us) were able to grab a slice.<//Text>

<Text>They are taking advantage of the pandemic and over charging for their food. They know they are the only choice on the mountain.. they closed indoor dining (no trash because other places are open) just so they can have less staff and charge 17.00 for a small plain dry bad pizza. Ohh and you’ll have to wait in a like in the cold for an hour to get the bad food. Staff really doesn’t care about the guests. They are there to be there.. this place could be nice if they took some time to fix their $it.< /Text>< gmap_id>

The room was really nice and clean. I thought the view would be from a top floor but it was on the first floor. The dinner was good. The only complaint is that the tub in our room was clogged and the water took forever to go down the drain. Another downfall was That I was told the breakfast would be available from 7-10am I arrived at 9am and it was already closed and we weren’t able to have breakfast.< /review>

The rooms are very clean.  The beds and pillows were comfortable.  The location was ideal for visiting Sequoia and King’s Canyon.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  We would definitely recommend this as the place to stay if you are visiting Sequoia National Park overnight.<//review>

<review>The location can't be better. The lodge is actually pretty. The room is ok, and generally pretty good. Simple. The thing is the service and the restaurant. The food is absolutely terrible. Not sure I had the bad luck to go when the cook was sick and a random staff took over the kitchen, but the person cooking my food, including the breakfast buffet, couldn't cook at all. Not even a simple pasta. They served an old pasta, which was definitely cooked earlier in the day. We couldn't eat. I saw that the couple next to us also couldn't eat their food and just left the restaurant.< /review></record></dataset><record>

This is exactly what I was looking for; a quiet place, adjacent to hiking and beautiful landscapes where I could sit and gather my thoughts. They are doing a great job of keeping everything clean and orderly during covid and the front desk are very helpful in answering where you can go to find the best spots to take some photos.< /Text>

<user_name>Jeff Kronson<//user_name><time>1528440686135</time><Rate>4<//Rate><Text>Combinations are modest but cozy and very woodsy. Surprisingly, the steak at the main restaurant in the lodge was outstanding and I had it on two separate occasions in a five night time frame. I've eaten steak all over North America and this is definitely in my top 10. Would go back there just for that. The staff are kind if not particularly overly helpful but the Lodge and Resort in the park are small enough compared to say Yosemite that one can get around without too much difficulty. Don't miss the Falls. One has to see the General Sherman tree though warning the hike back up the hill is not for the faint of heart at 7000 feet altitude<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhW8FVvRqq4rm26-WTjFuRRzVP9cyX76Eio3DW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
Even accounting for COVID-19 this establishment grossly over sells itself.
The rooms have not been updated in many years, carpets are not clean anywhere, and there were knobs missing from the dresser the TV sits on.
A/C consisted of a fan wedged into a window, there is no A/C that we found in our room.
Food choices are limited (COVID), however $17 for a frozen pizza is a stretch, especially when they are burned beyond recognition.  Check the boxes too because not only is there a good chance it's charred, it may not even be pizza.  Don't bother with the Bison burger either, any flavor it was supposed to have is cooked out of it.
We should have just camped.</Review>

Great place to go up and see snow during the winter months. Tons of hiking trails close to the lodge and several of the largest trees in the world. Make sure to bring chains if there is a chance of snow and take your time going up and down the roads as they can ice up. Highly recommend staying a few nights and bringing up some food to snack on by the outside tables or in the game room. Good place to get away from it all and spend time with family.</text>

<Text>We made a reservation at Wuksachi lodge through hotels.com. When we arrived at the lodge, the staff at the front desk said they did not have our reservation from hotels.com and offered us another room at the hotels.com price instead. Since it was pretty late, we agreed to pay again and book directly with the lodge and though we would get the refund from hotels.com after returning back. We could not connect to hotels.com while we were there due to network issues. After returning back home, when I reached out to hotels.com for a refund they declined my refund citing that the lodge told them that we were a no show. This incident happened in February and ever since then I am trying to get my refund either from hotels.com or Wuksachi lodge and both the places do not seem to care. Pathetic customer service.</Text>< gmap_id>

The hotel never bother to call us or write an email saying the hotel was cancelling the reservation and that would not be operating during the weekend we had a reset for! Same for Expedia... also was not even aware the hotel was closed. We found out when we got into to Sequoia Park at the day. So disrespectful !< /review>

The internet here is very bad.  It can be said that they have no network.  The hotel's system has major problems.  We booked the hotel online.  When we got there.  The front desk told me that they had not received the booking.  Let me pay to stay.  They only have my name.  Actually they received the money.  We arrived very late.  They were just taken for 2-3 hours.  Anxious waiting.  They did not try to contact the company.  It just means that they did not receive the money.  Breakfast was terrible and not cheap.  Just good location.</Text>

<Text>Up there on the mountain the air is really thin. So the people working there are a little spacey. When we arrived the room we reserved was not cleaned. It was a little disturbing after lugging the luggage up the steps. We were assigned a different room. It's pretty basic in the rooms, a step up from camping or renting a cabin. The WiFi only worked half the time and when it did it was very slow. The best part about the place is its food. The breakfast and the dinner were top notch and didn't disappoint. Trails immediately around the lodge aren't the best in the forest. Drive a bit south to get low enough where the Sequoia grow giant.</Text>< UserId.>

<review>We stayed here in feb and snowed the whole time. It was so beautiful! The only reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5... the rooms had no microwave which seams crazy to me since they have a fridge so all the food I brought for our kids was useless and second I really feel the rooms should have a shovel to shovel your car out. If someone takes it then charge the room but they do have them in the “store” for $20... just another way to make money off of guests. The room was clean. Shower sucked but it’s an old hotel so I wasn’t surprised. Bring something to do!!! The tv didn’t work and the WiFi is minimal. I did no research before our trip and wished I had so I would of brought a book.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZIoRLZQ20XTNK5TZL3MdY2Xj0EarITGFzAa2s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLAvxtnmjM13bRyxCggj7iOwlW9wgk_aQQaYgg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbiO9R5VuRBpkn_gxbm22nDzTAoAzOo_puTSSW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9DSNvl2fsprYPzZ-_1vyGgK2Xf2a_An-kG6m4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKSIjcm1DKkFfIL38rYSKJy7xgVlLtJoHYCFAG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1549909586036, 'text': 'Thank you Meaghan for staying with us.

I did not find the staff to be friendly nor very helpful. The only place to eat was the restaurant on side. The food was ok at best, and definitely not large enough accommodate the hotel. Your wait can turn into hrs, so be prepared. The room was definitely not worth with the price. I had a coffee pot, but no coffee nor condiments condiments. No store close enough to go too. I will say the location was acceptable.</text>

I found myself in this hotel only because my car broke in the woods. But despite of the stress I enjoyed my stay because this is a beautiful place, very comfortable and pretty rooms and extremely friendly and helpful staff. I still curse myself I didn't ask the names of the guys at the reception who shared their cable and cigarette when i needed it the most. Thank you!!!< /Review>

The rooms were very clean, well maintained and ready to give you a relaxing experience.
Their restaurant however has very few offerings and I would strongly suggest you finish your meals someplace outside the park if possible. The meals are definitely not worth the money at wuksachi lodge.<//text>

Loved our New Years stay here & would definitely stay here again! The restaurant is excellent & reasonably priced. Beautiful views from the dining room. The hotel staff was very friendly & helpful. The room was very comfortable & nice. Not super luxurious but it’s 7500 up in a National Park. The only complaint is that I upgraded at the last minute to a Deluxe ‘View’ room & there was a tree in front of the window so I couldn’t really see the mountains. It was a nice view but I expected a better view for the $25 upgrade. The rooms accommodate a family of 5 which is great. Can’t wait to come back!<//Review>

The Lodge is great. Perfect way to spend the trip to the giant forest. The only negative is the restaurant. The service was slow and food was not prepared well. Otherwise the Logde was great.</Review>

Didn't stay but ate in the restaurant. Food was great. Price perfect for lunch. Burgers were tasty and fries were out of this world! Lots of items on menu, we just stopped in for lunch so that's what we had. Service was great. Dont be scared by the high end looks of the place price was not over priced. Its view were stunning. Thank you for a great short visit! I would definitely stay here next time in the park.< /text>

< Review>
The lodge was beautiful and the staff friendly. Restaurant food and service were both very good. Our room was very nice. The lodge is pet friendly so we bought our dog. However, Sequoia National Park is not pet friendly, so double check your pet expectations and allowances. There was quite a bit of snow, but the pathways were clear. Would definitely go again, but without the dog.</Review>

<text>Large clean rooms near the lodge. WIFI and TV reception was poor, but we were not here for that. Hot breakfast is served for $14.00 at the lodge. The location is about in the middle of Sequoia National Park which makes it convenient to the sites.</text>< pictures>

<text>Wintertime visit - Upon arrival already tired from the long day of hiking didn’t realize the rooms were separate from the rest of the lodge. Lodge had a nice cozy fireplace with great Christmas decorations! Bar had great wings and draft beer! Definitely check the bar out. Excluding the bartender the customer service wasn’t the greatest, the wait staff seemed unorganized and all over the place. The rooms are divided into 3 different buildings, parking is pretty far from the actual entrance, you rely on a baggage cart to haul your items to your room. The path to the rooms were icy and snowy, not well cleared off. Not to mention the buildings with rooms had 3 floors with no elevators so that’s inconvenient. The room didn’t have a microwave which made things difficult for people who food prep vs expensive restaurant. It wasn’t worth the $225 we paid. BUT it wasn’t a bad stay - ended up having a very relaxing night in a beautiful area! This lodge is very convenient as far as location!< /text><Date>1545264926320< /Date><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1545233908594, 'text': 'Thank you Lexi for your detailed review.

<text>This place is nothing short of amazing. The location is out of the way, but that adds to the adventure and experience. We enjoyed all the trails of Sequoia for 4 days. The entire staff was very friendly. And the bar and The Peaks was fantastic food. If you want the best Old Fashioned, ask Cassidy to make it with Rye and lemon peel.<//text>< user>

<review>The Wuksachi lodge is a timeless classic and a true retreat into one of the most beautiful national parks in the state of California. The renovations made for a superb room and the staff all seemed to be quite cheerful. The predictable downsides are the relative high price of the room and restaurant, but it’s worth it. I hope to return one day!< /review>< name>

Such a peaceful place to stay. It definitely has a very happy feel! The room that my boyfriend and I stayed seemed up to date/nicely renovated, yet it still kept it's lodge/outdoorsy feel. Our room also had a balcony attached. The dining room in the main Lodge has plenty of delicious food options, and there is a buffet style breakfast in the mornings. I highly recommend this lodge!</text>

<text>How can it get any better than spending the night amongst giant trees?! The rooms are large and comfortable,  a/c is a bit poor but you don't need it at this elevation. Wifi in the main building (which reached to the room once I'd connected). Dinner and breakfast good and reasonably priced. And did I mention the giant trees?<//text></record></dataset><record>

We visited the Lodge itself, so I can't attest to the accommodations. The lodge is a classic chalet-style with large beams and high ceilings. Kind of a weird layout with the dining tables the way they were in parallel rows. It felt kind of.. "Institutional" in the dining commons. The food was "meh". The Porter on tap made up for that, and was GOOD. But hey, it's warm inside and the view of the trees is awesome. One critical point for me was the fireplace in the lobby- Euro tourists sitting, laying, and crowding the small amount of space there was, and not sharing the fire when we walked in. They were even more overbearing when we tried to occupy the space after we ate. They just kept hogging the bandwidth and sitting with their feet up on the furniture. I'd go back-<//text>

<Review>One of my favorite places in the world! The beauty of the park is other worldly and although a bit pricey it is so nice to have basic, clean amenities after a long day playing in the giant forest and mountains. Stop in for hot cocoa and fireside relaxing in the lobby before your dinner reservation. 😍</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I don't know a reason not to give this Lodge 5 stars. Staff is very helpful and friendly, pricing is fair in my opinion, especially the restaurant, where we expected the food to be expensive, was very decent.

I don't know what some people are expecting when they come to a Lodge in the mountains, but the rooms were nice, well equipped, showers were working fine, everything essential was there and working, that's all you should be worried about.

It actually snowed overnight, and we didn't have any chains in our rental car, which we had to buy at the lodge. They offered us help with the fitting process, so a guy came and did that for us too. Fantastic people, fantastic service, fantastic place.< /Review><user_id>117261171020557407642<//user_id><time>1548932661510</time><username>Slaven “SonnyBlack”< /username>< resp>

<text>A wonderful place to stay while visiting Sequoia National Park and seeing the Trees, doings some hikes, and visiting Kings canyon. My wife and I stayed here for 3-4 nights and I will not complain. We came May 7th, 2019 - May 10th, 2019

This place has the antique feel of an original lodge built in the mountains and is ran professionally.

The staff is friendly, the beds are comfortable from the sheets and pillows down to the softness/hardness of the mattress was to our liking. We felt like a king and queen sleeping on it and had good nights sleep every night. You may want earplugs when you sleep as people can be heard in the hallways if they're walking by and talking or closing doors somewhat loudly.

We didn't eat lunch there but had the all you can eat breakfast every morning and had dinner there 3 nights in a row.

The breakfast is decent for the price and the dinner is high quality but you will pay the price for it. Servers were excellent and friendly.
Breakfast is around $15-$20 per person and dinner is around $35-$50 if you are drinking alcohol.

They have a gift shop with everything you may need in case you forget something like snacks or chap stick etc.

Their dining room is open and makes you feel grand.

It's a good place that you should stay at if you want to remember yourself having a great time. Visit this place if you can or skip the hotel and just check out the trees.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Amazing location and view... Lackluster meal. We didn't stay at the lodge, but had dinner. It's in an awesome setting surrounded by trees and with great mountain views, especially on the outside deck. The meal was disappointing - just kind of average, nothing special with the menu options or flavors. Wish we would've just opted to enjoy the view from the deck with a drink and a snack rather than settling in for a proper meal.< /Text>

The hotel aesthetic is nice. The staff is friendly. They have a nice souvenir shop in the lobby as well as a warm fire. The rooms are a drive or walk from the lobby and the sign that tells you is not nearly big enough. (dont take your luggage to check in) The rooms do not have a microwave, the shower gives you half the normal amount of water so chances are you won't be able to enjoy a nice, warm shower. The rooms also do not have AC, ONLY heat. The sink water was also VERY cloudy and lastly, their wifi is terrible. You won't get any cell service. They definitely have some work to do.</Review>

<Text>Glorified motel. Trout was good and friendly service which cannot be said about the check in. Harfly any lights at night and no signs to get from parking lot to the rooms, dangerous.  Extremly disappointing rooms that reminded us of staying at a cheap motel. Disappointing. Nice wildlife around.<//Text><Name>Maggie Maggie</Name><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Everything is pretty good. Nothing is amazing. The beds/pillows sucked, the rooms were pretty and had a cabin feel. The food at their restaurant was pretty good most of the time. It feels like they were clearly understaffed as a result service was just ok.</Review>

We had such a great stay! Everyone at Wuksachi Lodge was super friendly and helpful, the food was good, the speciality drinks just awesome. The room was very clean, the beds cozy and comfortable, the scenery in the window picture perfect. On one of our hikes we met a very kind soul who works there, and she was so awesome as to walk us to see a great local spot, just to show it to us and make sure we would not lose our way. Thank you, and thank everyone at the Lodge for the great service. Needless to say that the Giant Forest, the General Sherman, The Congress trail and the Moro Rock will remain as unbelievably wonderful memories that we now share as family.<//Text>

Staying in the park was definitely worth it. We did the bead and breakfast package. Waking up early to tour the park made it easy to get around in the morning. Breakfast buffet in the morning was very good. Eggs, bacon, pancakes, sausage, potatoes and cereal and fruit. Dinner at the lodge was expensive but very tasty. The rooms were dated as we expected having stayed in parks before. They were clean, well appointed and comfortable. Highly recommend this park and lodge.</Review>

Wow!  We have never been treated so well.  We stayed for 3 nights and got the AAA discount and I guess we looked nice and had our room upgraded too. The rooms are away from reception in separate buildings but they provide any help you need. Our room had a view and everything was very clean.  King bed was memory foam and fine if you like them.  Food was served at the restaurant and prices are high but not what they could be since they are the only place in the park to eat in winter (February) and the food was excellent. Breakfast was buffet and you could choose two options cereal and sweet rolls at $7.50 or the whole shebang for $12.50.  Dinner had a complete menu from $12.00 - $34.00 and deserts were too good.  Creme  brûlée cheesecake and chocolate mousse were hits.  Wait staff were excellent and so helpful. Kim was exceptional in taking care of us. We will be coming back.</text>

It was a very pleasant and down to earth place to spend a few days away from the hustle and bustle.  Many, many tourists but for the most part everybody was kind, patient, not so much in a surry, and respected the environment around us.  I left the area much calmer and very proud to be an American.<//Review>

I had high hopes of what our time would be at the Wuksachi lodge. It was an experience that we splurged on and thought that it would enhance our enjoyment of Sequoia National Park. It was actually quite the opposite. The room was over 80 degrees when we arrived. The maintenance man came out after two calls about it. He turned off the wall units, but this still did not cool our "Superior" room below 75º F even with the windows open. I have never seen a baby pack-n-play as cheap as the one that was given for my daughter to sleep in. You could literally feel the bars through the mattress in it.

The Peak restaurant was the single largest disappointment. It is everything you would expect from a vendor that has a monopoly. The food was of terrible quality for the prices. The burger I ordered the first night was not cooked to temperature. The restaurant was out of milk at breakfast the first morning, meaning we could not give my one year old daughter milk. The kid's spaghetti that my kids ordered the second night made them both sick. The last morning we were there, they were literally running out of everything to the point where you had to ask the wait staff for each item. The only server that was helpful was Trevor.

I would not recommend the Wuksachi Lodge or the Peak Restaurant to anyone. You would be better off staying and eating outside of the park.

The Lodge sent me a survey after our trip which I gave them the same feedback as posted above and asked to be contacted. 6 weeks have passed and I still have not received a call.< /text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>The Wuksachi Lodge had a delicious restaurant inside, a small gift shop, and a comfortable seating area. The rooms are a short drive away, and boy are they pretty. The beds are comfy, the bathroom is clean, and you don't feel like you're on top of each other. But the views are really what elevate these rooms. I can't imagine there is a room in that lodge with a bad view. We were surrounded by trees, and you just felt so in touch with the park, despite being in a very comfortable bed. The breakfast was a buffet, and while it wasn't cheep, it was delicious! I ate so much it was crazy. I could write a whole separate post on the parks themselves. They are some of my favorite places in the world. So many different features all in one place, it's incredible. Plus the lodge offers a free shuttle all through these wonderful works of nature. This is a wonderful experience. You must must MUST book your room well in advance, sometimes a year out. But I promise it's worth it.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1501192713693, 'text': 'Thank you Julianne for the 5 stars..

Stayed at the lodge in a mountain view king suite in the Sequoia building. The bed was well "grooved" leaving a huge ridge in the middle and made me feel like I was falling off the side.  3 of the 4 window coverings were broken.  The views, however, were spectacular and the restaurant was good but pricey for park food. Wifi was overtaxed the entire time and I even had issues getting Google Maps to load directions because the connection was so poor.</Text>

Amazing location. Great service, especially  from the guy at reception, knows his stuff about the park. if you want any tips just ask him. Clean room and good size.  We where there at the beginning of March still deep in snow.  Made even more picturesque.< /Text>

<text>This is a great lodge that will give you the feeling you want out of a Woodsy California Adventure. We recently went to North Tahoe looking for this type of experience and were greatly disappointed. But, coming here, having the constellation night time thing, easy access to everything around here and the good restaurant located inside the lodge, it's everything you could ask for. Great experience.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>You couldnt ask for a better location in Sequoia than Wuksachi Lodge. Located 2 miles from Lodgepole (which is where they have a marketplace, grill, and the shuttle for the other Sequoia attractions), Wuksachi is right where you want to be located in the park. The lodge itself and the room was clean, but unfortunately when we were there in July 2018, they were under construction on the grounds, both in front of the lodge and next to the dining room. This really takes away from the experience, and I was surprised they were doing the work during peak season? The lodge itself has very little when it comes to amenities. There is a restaurant on site that actually had great food at a mid-level price. The downside is you need to book reservations for dinner, so unless you get them in early, you will find yourself eating at either 5:00 or 8:00. There is not much else to do at the lodge. No pool or game room or anything like that. That may not be an issue for most since the main reason to visit Sequoia is to be in the park, but for people who like to break up their adventures with a day at the resort, there is nothing to do at this one. They did have a nice stargazing retreat at night which was provided free of cost, and that was a lot of fun. In terms of the rooms, be aware that they do not have A/C, just window and ceiling fans. Since it was Summer when we were at the lodge, it was pretty warm during the day and the room was stuffy. Thankfully it cooled down enough at night.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

But, having to carry all personal items including coolers (because of bears) was a real bummer because rooms are far from parking lots and up on the hill.

Also, lack of an AC unit was harder to deal with than I thought. Even after opening all windows and turning on all the fans at max speed for 2+ hours before sleep, I had some trouble getting asleep because the room was too hot.

All the staffs I interacted with were very friendly and professional.< /review><user>108801970513974045432< /user><gmap_id>0x80955e7bbfa947a1:0x569f3289d86ec019</gmap_id><Time>1531164130823<//Time></record></dataset><record>

<review>This is a very decent lodge.  It's not gigantic, it's not part of a village, and there is no night (or day-life) here.  It is very quiet, very clean and well kept with a well placed restaurant.  All in all, very peaceful and just minutes away (driving) from the General Sherman and the well-stocked (Food, wine, spirits and lots of souvenirs) convenient store. I will never forget this place.<//review>< pics>

<username>Evan W</username><text>An amazing hideaway tucked deep into the mountains of Sequoia National Park. The lodge is rustic, cozy, and and excellent place to relax after a long day of hiking and exploring. The rooms aren't luxury, however they are nice enough to get the job done and keep heat inside. I would give 5 stars for the location, scenery, and service. However, I have to give 4 stars because there is only one dining option on site which is quite expensive. I would definitely return again and recommend this place to anyone visiting Sequoia National Park.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I reserved this hotel back in September to spend Thanksgiving. I did it online with 3 months in advance and the payment went through. One week before my trip they left a message saying there were no rooms and I was moved to a days inn hotel. I never received the message. They day of my check in, I called to cancel
the reservation since a winter storm was coming and we're not going to make it. Then they told me I didn't have the room anyway. Horrible costumer service. I only imagine driving there through the storm and no having a room. I only advice if you're going to book, call them and be sure you got a room before driving there.< /text>

Rooms are large, bed is comfortable, but like all the older National Park Lodging there is no A/C. Room was comfortable with fans even with high 80s temps.

Great staff with the exception of the restaurant. For the price of the food it was under cooked, some of it actually still frozen. Flat soda and they didn't get me another soda until after I had already finished all the food. The meat was pretty much raw and full of oil. It's a shame that such a beautiful (and expensive) lodge can't compliment itself with a decent dining experience.<//text>

<rating>4<//rating><text>We stayed one night. The main Lodge is nice, with a warm fire and nice restaurant. It's fairly new and is very "mountain lodge" in decor - rustic and comfortable. The actual rooms are in three separate buildings. The location of the rooms could be a problem for people with disabilities ( not a problem for us) but if I had trouble with a lot of walking and some uphill walkways, it wouldn't be good. The rooms were clean, no wifi in rooms, but you could get it in the main Lodge building. The location is in one of the most beautiful places on the earth, so that is biggest plus, in my opinion. Meals were not included, so consider that when booking. The only place to eat ( breakfast, lunch or dinner) is at the restaurant in main Lodge building. Full breakfast was around $14, continental was $8. We had dinner in restaurant. The food was very good at average-high price. It has to be trucked in over hairy mountain roads, so I'm sure that is reason for prices.</text>< pictures>

Great place to stay! Nice clean rooms. Nothing fancy. Don't expect to have cell reception and the wifi is pretty darn slow but free and serviceable. The lodge is very close to some of the Park's best offerings! You'll find General Sherman, The Giant Tree Museum, and many hiking trails very close by.<//Text>

<text>I give Wuksachi Lodge a 5 star because of the amazing service and kindness of the workers.

--So I brought my brand new Canon Rebel t5i to take photos and videos on in Sequoia National Park because it is spectacularly beautiful! But, this was a very brand new Camera, like I got it only a week ago and I bought it from my uncle and he gave me some other cool gear with it too, including a charger. Unfortunately, it was the wrong charger for my camera. So toward the end of the first day our of three day trip, I was devastated because my camera was on low battery and I was going to not be able to film and photograph the rest of the trip. HOWEVER, I asked the workers at the front desk if any of them had a spare charger and they thought of all their coworkers who had cameras. Eventually, one of the coworkers had the exact same camera and the right charger and she let me use hers. Her name was Victoria Dunbar and she even insisted on letting me bring HER charger back to my room to charge my camera for the duration of my stay!

The views from where we stayed are also incredible and the bedroom was very big and spacious. The cots they have are also the best cots I have ever slept on!

By and large, fabulously friendly staff.</text><Rate>5</Rate><gmap_id>0x80955e7bbfa947a1:0x569f3289d86ec019</gmap_id><Date>1465311826044<//Date>< Resp>

<Review>My fiance and I visited the Lodge hoping to get a better feel of the location and services before signing a wedding contract with them. The staff was very nice, and the facility was very clean. We dine at the restaurant and the staff was very hospitable. My fiance has a gluten allergy (full celiac) and they were great about accommodating so that she felt safe. The food was also pretty good! It's a beautiful location that we'll definitely return to.</Review></record>

The location was great inside if the park. Service was good, could choose to opt out of room service but they where super helpful. Rooms where decently sized. In the morning if you where up early enough you could see deer from outside your window.< /review>

Had a wonderful time staying at the Wuksachi Lodge. The location is excellent, only a couple of miles away from the best attractions of the Sequoia National Park. We visited the peak restaurant for 2 dinners and breakfast. Other than the steak knives being dull, the food was great and their drinks were refreshing. They had good prices and selection for being such an isolated restaurant. We also ordered the box lunches since we were going hiking all day, and they were very satisfying. The lodge is where you check in and the location of the restaurant and gift shop, and the rooms are in their own separate buildings detached from the lodge. There is a path that travels between the two that is about a 5 minute walk.</text>

Wuksachi is located at the top of Sequoia NP, close to the sequoia groves an King's Canyon NP. It is a unique setup, the main common area of front desk and restaurant is separate (a short 5 minute walk) from all the rooms. The restaurant, gift shop, heated deck, and front desk have a mountain Lodge setting and mountain view. The room accommodation portion of Wuksachi is more of a very basic hotel. The room provides basic beds, a small fridge, small TV, and and attached bathroom. While it meets all needs, I believe the rooms were overpriced and the room buildings require some renovations. Do not expect anything like a Lodge.<//Review>

Have had lunch here on all my visits to the park, and this time I believe they had redone their menu a bit. Had the club sandwich and it featured this amazing cheese that really brought out the sandwich. Waiter was very nice and sparked a conversation to get to know us a bit. All the food looked good.

Have not stayed here, but will be staying on our next visit in June.<//Review>

<review>We went up for a few days and had a nice stay in the snow. The hotel was well staffed although they all insist on calling you Mr and Mrs, which I found a bit too formal for my liking. The restaurant had quite a selection for being in such a remote area and the bartender was fun to talk to. The drinks they made really fit the weather. Speaking of which, if you intend to go up during snow season, be sure you buy snow chains and learn how to put them on BEFORE you make the drive. Many people got into minor accidents or had no idea how to put on chains when they needed to. Lucky many of the people there will help you out, if you don't run into anyone and you can't put on your chains, you might be stuck for several hours like some of the folks I met.< /review>< UserId.>

Wuksachi Lodge will over book!  How do I know, we booked, gave the credit card, got the confirmation and started on the way up the hill. This was a direct reservation no 3rd party was used. When we talked with them they stated they don't use any 3rd party sites.  Note this place is in the park so you must pay a fee to get to it. What made me more fired up was the screen I could see they had over booked people the next two days, too. They had no place for us to go except to spend an hour and half going back down to three rivers out of the park.  Book at your own risk! It's my understanding this is owned by the Delaware North Company (DNC) who also has the market next door while trying to find if a camping option could work. One star is as low as it will let me go but it should have no stars. If you had the same issue please let people know, it's a long way to go without another option. #WillOverBook #Hotel #WuksachiLodge</Text>

<Review>I'm writing this primarily to tie-up a many-month feedback lapse: One of the lodge employees, with a name-tag denoting Josil, very kindly provided my wife and I a set of lengthy explanations to a long list of inquiries. A lot of detail garnered from her personal experiences helped us significantly. This was while we were staying at the lodge where where she worked as a receptionist, not the restaurant-portion.

However, in coming here I've seen a perplexing mix of restaurant reviews. There must be some variability in chefs! To provide our tip on that balance - the restaurant was fantastic. The portions were large - much larger than expected! Very pleasing when you've been traipsing about the Sequoias all day. (Also worth noting - they provided gluten-free options, a must for my wife.)  The workload on the wait-staff was quite high, but provided great service despite this. Equally important, the ambiance of the place was lovely and perfectly suited the external environs/views thereof. A high-ceiling open space, stone slab and timber construction, centered on a large, radiant fireplace.< /Review>< Date>

It's a nice place. It's definitely in the mountains, after a lot of winding road. Make sure you have plenty of gas. We thought we did. But not even half way up, we decided to turn around because it's so winding and steep, it was not helping conserve our gas. The rooms are nice though. Not strong wifi considering the location and amount of people trying to use it. But not a bad thing. Also, dinner requires reservations so if you missed that, as I did, reserve for your first night and whenever else you want to eat. You're probably not gonna want to drive an hour+ to try going back into town to eat. And then an hour to get back up. Nice place though.<//Text>

A charming lodge in the beautiful Sequoia NP. Beds were a bit on the firm side and could use more pillows. Staff was friendly and helpful in navigating us to areas of the park. Nothing beats stepping out of your hotel room to a gorgeous mountain view.

Some things to note:
- The path from the check in area to the three lodges isn't particularly well lit. Make sure to bring a flashlight when walking about at night.
- When you access the Sequoia set of rooms, there are a set of shallow, uneven stairs with no handrail. However, there is a ramp which makes for a much smoother walk.
- The front desk fails to mention this, but it is on the check in materials that a bellhop can bring your luggage to your room. You can also get a luggage cart in your lodge "house" and wheel it down to the car.
- There is no pool. Believe it or not, someone asked the bartender if there was a pool. No, but there are streams and lakes.
- Be prepared to disconnect from your cellphone. Wifi is often spotty and cellular service is practically nonexistent.

Meals are not included with the room rate. The buffet breakfast that is in the restaurant adjoining the check-in area of the lodge is average and I don't feel it is worth the $16-20 unless you eat more than one plate of food. (The prices for the buffet vary based on whether you get the cold or hot breakfast, and the price seems to vary based on whether it is the week or weekend, and the time of year you visit.) It is a typical "American" breakfast of potatoes, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, pancakes, pastries, toast, bagels, cereal, some fruit, and oatmeal. There isn't anything special about the breakfast. The pizza from the restaurant, however, is delicious. So are most of the dishes served for lunch and dinner.<//review>

The service at the restaurant is slow and disorganized. Be prepared to wait an hour even for a simple sandwich! However, the atmosphere is amazing, with gorgeous views of the mountains, so the wait can be bearable with good company, an appetizer and some drinks.

The food is fresh and relatively healthy for a restaurant, with vegan and vegetarian options available. While the food isn't amazing on its own, for the elevation at 2000m+ (7000ft+) above sea level, the quality is amazing.<//Text>

Staying inside the park was perfect. But overall the lodgings are not great value for money.Staff in the lodge reception were a bit clueless. We asked for some basic advice about where to park for seeing some highlights in the park and the need for snow chains and reception staff didn’t seem to know much.The lodging is in a separate building which is fine. A bit like a motel in the middle of the woods. Plenty of parking. Half of the rooms are on the 2nd floor with no elevator. We were lucky to get a 1st floor room so we didn’t have to carry luggage up. Plenty warm enough even in snowy, cold conditions and clean enough.Your only food option is the restaurant in the lodge which gets booked up so make sure to reserve when you arrive. The restaurant is ok but not amazing.</review>

We came in early April and the place was still mostly snowed in. The lodge and the rooms are a couple of hundred meters apart. The rooms themselves are the standard hotel fair, but take heed that there are no elevators, so if you are on the second or third floor you will have to carry your luggage (if you have any) up the long walkway from the car parking to the building and then up the stairs.
In the end, the place is amazing since it is in an amazing place.< /review>

Location is extremely far away from the south end of the park entrance. But the cabin is warm, serves delicious food, has great local craft beer, and even offers coffee and donuts for free downstairs.

Favorite part: they sell little Sequoia seedlings to grow your own!<//Review>

I've been to the lodge several times in the past and the food has always been excellent. This time, however, my wife and I were unable to eat as the restaurant closes from 230-430. I was upset because we arrived at 225 and the hostess would not seat us and seemed annoyed that we even asked. I normally love the lodge's food and that's why I gave it a 4, but the service just wasn't there this time. Still a great place to visit and eat at though!</text>

The location is scenic and beautiful. My main issue was the bed. My husband and I woke up with severe back pain. The bed was shot and needs replacement.</Review>

A place in the heart of Sequoia national park. Billions of stars at night, amazing sunrises and sunsets, giant trees and thrilling stories amazing experience! If you come here in winter bring chains ans a shovel - when it snows you'll have to dig!</Review>

Beautiful lodge designed with a very nice restaurant inside. It has a nice cozy feeling because of the lights, the sofa seats, complimentary coffee and hot water, and a nice fireplace. The lodge is also open 24/7 and serves as a nice information center for visitors as well.<//review>

Not only just a friendly helpful they went out of their way to ensure that we had a good time the maitre d keep restraunt open  open 15 minutes later because we checked in late.
The next morning we got breakfast late  because we just did t wake up. The bellhops helped us all the way through. The entire staff went out of their wayone lady stayed an extra half-hour to ensure we got check in even though we were there at the last minute gift shop people were just absolutely greatall in all this is one of the better experiences of itrip exploring five different national parks. I highly recommend this place what is my wife and both of my who are 31 and 25 years old. My son was also invited by the people that work there to play his guitar after hours with the employees. All in all a better than greatwe will go back there I can't even though we live over 1,500 miles away we are already planning our next trip just to go there< /Review>

<Review>We stayed here for one night on the weekend in mid December. The Superior room was large and clean. If you bring children, definitely book this room. The atmosphere was spectacular! The short walk to the main lodge for dinner was great! We had an amazing dinner and the service was excellent (except the bar tender was quite slow). There was few feet of snow in the surrounding area but the walkways were shoveled and clear. I recommend you bring a good flashlight if you plan on walking out of your room after dark, the hotel does provide one but it isn't that great. Overall, I highly recommend this Lodge to stay!</Review>< Rate>

Lodging staff was nice but seemed to be either misinformed or uniformed about most topics we asked about. The hotel part was clean, cool, and quiet. The restaurant was mediocre at best. The food was inconsistent, one night food was great, next night food was bad enough I'll never eat there again.<//Review>

The lodges are beautifully built in the midst of the  Sequoia mountains and at night you perfectly see the stars. There's many driving areas to visit and go hiking, all with in reach of the lodges. At the registration office there is a gift and little market center and a nice  lounging area with a chimney and comfortable seating area and a restraunt inside. I came in the beginning of April and there was a nice coat of snow still. Overall experience it was a 10<//text>

The lodge was nice looking rustic, very helpful and welcoming staff. The rooms were nice and cozy, even included a refrigerator to keep some cold drinks. The available lunch boxes were great for mid day lunch while touring the park.<//Text>

<Text>This lodge is a perfect place to spend a couple nights up in the mountains.  My wife and I booked a two night stay at the lodge following our wedding in Vegas and could not have been more pleased.  The food was amazing and the restaurant provided boxed lunches for traveling around sequoia the next day.  Our waiter Matt, was very helpful in mapping out places to visit around the park and helped make our little honeymoon a very romantic and memorable one.  Our room was extremely nice, clean, and cozy.  I really have nothing but praises for this lodge!<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Staff are friendly and helpful.  Rooms are adequate but thats all. The beds are hard.  The door would not lock from the outside.  The restaurant was very disappointing.  I have been there in previous years and the food has been good, but this time, November 2015, I have to say that the food was very poor indeed.  They kept running out of items, including milk during  breakfast time.  I had two breakfasts, one lunch, and two dinners while there and not one meal was good and it was very pricey.   The lunch sandwich was burnt to a crisp and even the manager agreed it was inedible. i complained and they took the price off my bill.   This is such a shame as it used to be wonderful.  I don't think my husband and myself will be returning.< /Text>

<Review>We loved our stay, the superior suites were very nice! There were a few surprises, which were inconvenient. I did not realize that the lodge was made up of multiple buildings. It was a bit of a pain to lug all our gear and kids up the snowy paths to the rooms. I knew there would be limited cell reception and internet, however, it was really unnerving to stay in a room where the phone did not work. We came with family and all were in different buildings and our room was the gathering space. We had no way of communicating...except to keep walking back and forth between buildings. The most frustrating things was  that there was no apology or recognition for the inconvenience, just a kind "we'll put in a maintenance request." We were there 2 nights.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1554933434331, 'text': 'Dear Elizabeth, We are deeply sorry that you phone was not working during your stay.

Whenever go to Sequoia National Park I always stop at Wuksachi Lodge for a meal at the restaurant. It is conveniently located just off the main road and just couple of miles from Lodgepole. The food choices and atmosphere are as in a class restaurant, not as the usual fast food choices usually found at remote locations like this. Highly recommend for a quality meal or a romantic dinner by the fireplace.<//review>

In this day when so many amazing vegan options exist, why offer such an uninspiring dish? Overall the view from the window and the friendly staff made the experience positive.<//text>< Pictures>

Great time just hanging out in the snow. it snowed while we were there which was pretty. This was really just a time to get away from the city with my wife. During the winter there is mostly just cross country snow shoe or ski options but we just hung out at the lodge and played board games.<//Review>

<review>Arrived on Sunday before Labor Day with my family of 7 expecting no rooms available. To my surprise, they had a standard room and a suite. They were kind to show me both rooms to see which suits better. I ended choosing the suite and they even gave me a break on the price.
The rooms are across the lodge in 3 separate buildings that resemble large cabins. The beds are comfortable and staff was very nice. The views are awesome and the dark sky from the parking lot is breathtaking, would stay there again.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Out deep in the woods clean rooms, lots of hiking trails starting right from the hotel . Only complaints would be it's a hike from the parking lot to the rooms and very dark. But they probably aren't allowed a lot of lights to disturb the wildlife, as it is on a federal park. also Pepsi vending machine was either totally empty or broke. But I would stay again<//text>

< Review>
Nice place to stay in the middle of the National Park. I snowed during the night we stayed (April 2018) so it gave some more charm to the place overall (plus some work removing the snow for the car ^^). Consider bringing your own food in the park, because as far as I remember, it was expensive there.< /Review>

Loved the environment at the lodge. The grounds were beautiful, and the staff was friendly and helpful. I attended a wedding there this August. I did not stay the night, so I cannot comment on the rooms. The wifi was slow, but it's out in the woods so it was expected.<//review>

For the location it really can't be beat. A bit pricey, but given where it is it's understandable. The beds aren't the comfiest, and the shower heads are pretty bad. But the staff is amazing, the facilities clean, and overall it was a great experience.</review>

What an experience to stay in a National Park. Accommodations are adequate. Price is amazing, we even got a Groupon which gave us free breakfast for 2 for two days. Although the breakfast buffet leaves much to be desired, it was free. Dinner was a bit pricey and the two seafood options (shrimp tacos and rainbow trout) we chose were not worth it. Overall we would stay here again.< /review>

< Review>
The rooms were nicer than expected. The restaurant was hit-or-miss, and one member of our party was locked out of their room for over 2 hours with little assistance from hotel management. We ultimately improvised a way to "pick" the lock on the room ourselves. Didn't leave a great impression. Overall, though, it's a great location for park access if you aren't interested in camping.<//Review>

We stopped in to view the gift shop, grab a drink and use the WiFi to check the weather. The lodge was warm and the staff was friendly. We didn't get a chance to stay, as they had no availability, but the fireplace was nice to warm ourselves by.<//review>

Even though this was off season, the service was attentive and the food was tasty (he had pasta, I had duck). And the chocolate mouse was very rich. I would definitely recommend eating here while you visit the park.< /text>

I loved this place it's like you don't want to go back to reality.  Loved the quietness and their service. Employees at check in and at the lodge were helpful and friendly. They even provide you with toiletries (toothbrush and tooth paste)need to ask though.  The rooms have shampoo and body wash pumps  inside the shower.There is only one place too eat and dinner is expensive but what makes it much more pricey is that you Have Too Pay your waiter a tip and your tab tells you how much YOU HAVE TO PAY that's the only negative thing I can say about this lodge. I believe they should make it into a buffet and that way more people would go up there.  The stay is expensive as it is and you can't drive no where because the road that gets you too the top 8,500 feet has sharp turns and it's dangerous to be driving at night.  By the way the room has no microwave. I went during thanksgiving week 2016. yes we got snow the next day.< /text>

Stopped by on Christmas eve, and ate lunch at the restaurant. Got a bunch of sandwiches and burgers. Great view! The "Californian" poutine didn't look that good when it came but was pretty delicious. Portions were pretty good too.< /review>

< Review>
Overall I enjoyed my stay. I knew there was snow but i wasnt prepared for 90 inch of it. They did have paths cleared out dso that was good. It got a bit confusing when driving up though. The only reason i gave 4 stars is because there was a good walk from the room to the service desk/restaurant. Also the dinner at the restaurant was pricey and not very good. The breakfast was better. It was basically the only place to eat while out there except going down a ways from the lodge to the store where you can buy packaged sandwiches and microwave food ect. Fyi no microwave in the room just a mini fridge and a coffee pot. I will stay here again but be more prepared with the food part lol.</Review>

<Text>Stayed at this hidden gem 12/12-14.  Its nice to have a decent place to stay at within a national park.  HOWEVER, they decided to perform some upkeeps to the lodges; although it makes complete sense to do this during off peak season, they have failed to 1. have any warnings chemicals will be used; such as paint thinners2. NO ventilation where areas of chemicals are used - windows kept closed in the halls and doors also closed3.  starting the construction at 8:30AM4. Failed to place all guests in 1/3 or 2/3 lodges and work on one lodge at a time5. upon expressing a complaint at check out (after having headaches, nausea, and swollen eyes/face due to the chemicals) everyone whom I talked to from the front desk to the executive chef of the lodge were extremely nice ...EXCEPT the manager.  I left my number and email for the manager to reach me.  I waited long enough in the lobby to have the chance to speak with him, but he was in a meeting.  WHICH WAS FINE, but he should have contacted me.  It has now been over 48 hours since I left the premise and I have yet to hear from management.This is simply a case of gross negligence.  Its a beautiful get-away to enjoy mother nature.  The last thing I had expected was to be sleeping with fumes the whole night that resulted in severe discomfort for me and my pups.  Any time they passed the halls, they sneezed.  I do not wish this kind of experience on anyone, especially at a national park.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Food was average..over priced.
Not friendly for food allergies.
Very busy .. hard to find a person to talk to.

Ordered food with modifications due to food allergies and we specifically asked to speak to chef due to cross contamination issues. Server had no idea about food allergies. After half an hour of wait ,they came and said chef is very busy , he cant come.

I am.ok if restaurants tell that they can't accommodate. But like this after my kid was prepared that he is eating here along with everyone and waited half an hour and then couldn't get any food .< /text>

Stopped on a visit to see the giant redwood trees. First stopped in the gift shop. It majorly changed since the last time I was there. Gift shopped seemed smaller. Decided to eat lunch in the resturant. Food tasted great. Had a long wait but it seemed like they might have been under staffed.<//Text>

I would give 5 star for the beauty of the place and the location. Unfortunately we had to wait so long for our waiter first and food after.. They need a better organization of the restaurant. People look like they did not want to see us. The food was good overall and the waiter turned out to be a nice guy. I was there with my wifey for lunch the day after Thanksgiving. Don't stop for lunch if you want to go around the park, it may take a long time.< /text>

<response>{'time': 1480618869976, 'text': "Hi Michele,\n\nThanks for the review. I'm sorry that you had to wait so long. We do understand this is a problem and have tried various ways to improve it, but the reality is that we simply need more capacity. To that end, we do have an expansion planned for the restaurant and, beginning next summer there will also be a barbecue on the grounds of Wuksachi Lodge. So we definitely apologize for the wait and do want to let you know that we think we have solutions, but as with any expansion in a national park, the time from planning to implementation can be quite long.\n\nI'm sorry that the wait took away from your time to enjoy the scenery, but glad to hear that you did at least have some time to appreciate the five-star beauty!"}</response><Gmap_id>0x80955e7bbfa947a1:0x569f3289d86ec019< /Gmap_id></record>

<review>The lodge itself is gorgeous with a nice restaurant and a beautiful view. Only major problem is the pretty bad Internet connection across the lodge. That's the price you pay for being in the middle of the first though, I suppose.< /review>< Rate>

Stayed at this hidden gem 12/12-14.  Its nice to have a "decent" place to stay at within a national park.  HOWEVER, they decided to perform some upkeeps to the lodges; although it makes complete sense to do this during off peak season, they have failed to 1. have any warnings chemicals will be used; such as paint thinners
2. NO ventilation where areas of chemicals are used - windows kept closed in the halls and doors also closed
3.  starting the construction at 8:30AM
4. Failed to place all guests in 1/3 or 2/3 lodges and work on one lodge at a time
5. upon expressing a complaint at check out (after having headaches, nausea, and swollen eyes/face due to the chemicals) everyone whom I talked to from the front desk to the executive chef of the lodge were extremely nice ...EXCEPT the manager.  I left my number and email for the manager to reach me.  I waited long enough in the lobby to have the chance to speak with him, but he was in a meeting.  WHICH WAS FINE, but he should have contacted me.  It has now been over 48 hours since I left the premise and I have yet to hear from management.

This is simply a case of gross negligence.  Its a beautiful get-away to enjoy mother nature.  The last thing I had expected was to be sleeping with fumes the whole night that resulted in severe discomfort for me and my pups.  Any time they passed the halls, they sneezed.  I do not wish this kind of experience on anyone, especially at a national park.</text>

On arrival the parking was farther from the building than we expected, and the walkway was not well lit. The rooms do have wifi, but it's slow. Don't expect it to be reliable when everyone comes back to the hotel at night. The restaurant was ok. We ordered medium burgers that came out well done. On the other hand we ordered a medium rare steak that was perfect. The shower heats up quickly, and water pressure is good. The bedding had some stains.< /Review>

Anna, very rude customer service. She attended my call and was not trained to handle basic questions of wearher and road conditions. I could not understand her and she made fun of me. I was looking forward to returning to this park after 25 years, but now with my kids. It is unfortunate that individuals like Anna are not grateful and start ruining our experience. Please give her more training or days off to appreciate guests.</Review>

I had come here for lunch several years ago, and had a great experience. However, this trip it seems they have gone downhill. It's unfortunate, as I really enjoyed my last visit. The service was really not great, food passable, but not memorable. The bartender, however, was great. Perhaps this was a bad night, so still four stars.< /Review>

I'm writing this review only on the restaurant, at which my wife and I ate twice during our vacation in Sequoia National Park.

The food was pricey, as I would expect from any restaurant in such a unique location, but I didn't feel it was bad quality. My wife and I both enjoyed what we ordered. I ordered the turkey burger both days, and my wife ordered the prime rib sandwich. I will say that it wasn't any more expensive than the Grant's Grove restaurant, however. If you want to eat "real" food (by that I mean, not junk food) in the Sequoia park, these are your only two options.

I can corroborate a previous statement that we were told dinners were by reservation only; however, we went back to the lodge later to use the facilities, and I asked if they had any dinner openings, and I was told enthusiastically that they did, and from what I could tell, the dinning room was veritably empty.< /Review>

There was little to no wifi in the rooms, the breakfast buffet lacked good service, the food was DECENT, but not for the price, and the beds had no fitted sheet. This place was way over priced for what they provided. The only plus would be the amazing view and beautiful archetichture of the lodge long building.<//Text>

< Review>
Where to start, entire visit was terrible. For starters we waited 5 minutes to be seated for lunch, when the hostess finally took us back the entire dining room was empty. Not sure why the wait. Next the waitress messed up my side and never came back with my fries. She was not friendly until it came time to tip then she was all about asking where we were from. Kind of obvious she could care less. Next went to the gift shop where I waited once again to pay. The girl was more interested in giving directions than ringing up the people waiting in line. Terrible service for what looked like a nice place.<//Review>

<text>Picture-window vistas of the sequoias and a muted Indian theme in the decor, with an unexpected Japanese touch in the interesting earthenware dishes. Menu has that depressingly burger-centric mix familiar from American ski resorts. A Martian would come away innocent of the knowledge that this restaurant is perched above the preeminent fruit-and-vegetable-growing region of North America, such is the generic, corporate feel of the menu.

Service on my visit was slipshod, with a fifteen-minute wait to order. A competent salmon sandwich arrived with fries which a charitable soul would describe as lukewarm.

A prime location suffering from the slackness bred of monopoly, I suspect.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Beautiful setting in a forests of beautiful trees. Be aware rooms are not air conditioned and summer temps can be problem. Front desk staff was somewhat unfriendly when I told her our window fan wasn't working. Her answer was well we can't guarantee that it can be fixed. So with the granddaughters complaing of the heat inside the room we were fortunately great full when the window fan started to run . It cooled down during the night so that made it bearable. Be forewarned that breakfast was substandard and dinner was bad. My daughters unable to eat their food. In short the natural surrounding of the beautiful sequoia is stunning. But unfortunately  the front desk are unfriendly and robotic< /text>

Check-in personnel need to know and share more info about shuttle service. We learned more by overhearing another's conversation. The staff was never rude or mean just not as knowledgeable as we expected. Clean room, hot water was extremely hot and was at times too hot. The room had a fridge but no microwave. The fridge's thermostat was buried under the 'freezer' section's ice and as such it never got the fridge section nicely cold because it always thought it was cold enough. We appreciated the shuttle service but two drvers we had were very curt while another driver was very friendly and helpful. Most shuttle rides were very crowded and we would've done more driving if parking was more generous. The lodge restaurant had, at best, reasonable food but was overpriced and not worth the cost. Given another chance we would buy our food from the lodgepole market (2 miles away) and prepare sandwiches ourselves. Example: day one we bought an $8 burger (from the children's menu) that was worth $16, but on day two we paid $18 for a bison burger which we never want to eat again. The fresh fruit, available at every meal we ate, was always very good but repetitive (pineapple, cantelope, and honeydew). The meal portions we're good. The four stars were mainly due to location and condition of the hotel. It was in a beautiful place and hard to not appreciate the view. Being located within the park saved us an hour plus (minimum) drive each day to reach the sights. We would recommend the lodge and, if we go back, we will stay there again.< /Text>

<Review>I really feel this place does a much better job than what I received. There were a lot of headaches in the beginning, but management straightened everything out. The room was clean, the dinner staff was exceptionally friendly and easy-going, and one can not complain about the easy access to the national and state parks. Had it not been for Mr. J, I would have left a 1-star review and a much longer description.

A few side-notes: Dinner is a bit over-priced, they should have wild-caught fish at those price points. I had a couple whiskey-doubles (Glenlivet & Chivas) which put me back 45 bucks, felt like I was at a freaking night-club in San Fran.

Make sure you know whether or not the roads are open via the route you plan to take in. They may close the northern route because of snow and it will suck to have to go ALL the way around (+4 hours minimum).

The team knows the wifi situation is no good. That being said, after speaking with management, the fix they were in the final stages of implementing should solve a lot of problems, looks like I just came on the wrong day. Ignore bad WIFI comments before today's date. If bad WIFI comments persist after March 15 or so, I'd say their solution was no good and they have to continue working on it.

Hope this helps someone!< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Very dispointed:

The guy at checkin told us our room had a premium view of the mountains (paid300$ CAD for the room) - the only thing we could see was the parking lot

The restaurant : TERRIBLE - ordered pasta with cherry tomatoes - got no flavoured pasta (butter pasta) and no cherry tomatoes, just a regular piece of crushed tomato. It was disgusting.

Every dollar spent here is a mistake. How could people give a 5star review? They must be paid...<//review><Date>1506260062618</Date><Resp>{'time': 1506716268060, 'text': 'I deeply apologize for your negative experience.

Because of tge wooden floors you can hear your upstairs neighbours walk around the room. Ours thought they needed to run a marathon at 4.30 (morning) so it was impossible for us to get more sleep. We just got up early and went for breakfast to find out most of the buffet was allready gone.  Dinner was great tho.  The room we got was not cleaned at all (beds not made, towels all over the ground) so we had to be put in another room. No elavator, wifi limited. Location great</text>< Pics>

Giant Forest Lodge in 1957 and 1961 was among the Big Trees, but is no more. Even our camp ground in Giant Forest has been closed -- for good reason. But I don't agree with the man who say he would rather rent an RV. My rooms, in two separate buildings, for my stays were excellent, and who can complain about walking 200 yards to a quite satisfactory dining room. I gave it only four stars only because the rooms are several hundred yards from the dining room.

went in for lunch on the memorial day weekend. the place was scenic, food reasonable enough. but the lodge and dining room had a feeling that they really didn't want you there.( seemed severely underataffed) took 30 mins to seat us when multiple tables were empty. once we were seated took another 30 mins to take and order and then serve lunch. food was pretty reasonable for the price and I hope this is one off experience due to the memorial day<//text>

<Review>Due to the many highly rated reviews, I was expecting more than what I paid for. $230 as a discounted AAA rate isn't peanuts, and for that price I was expecting a resort and not a motel.

First, there is no parking directly in front of the reception for guest to quickly check in. You would still have to park in the parking lot and run to the lobby to check in. I guess I didn't look as good as the previous guest, because I didn't get my room upgraded. Hotel staff greeted me and gave me some brief information to get my stay started.

Upon getting to the rooms, I had to park in a no parking zone to get my bags out. Though there were many luggage carts, there were no attendants to help unload and transport to the room. Baggage was then lugged to the second story up the stairs due to the lack of elevator.

The room was about the same size as an average yet dated Hampton inn with far less amenities. No microwave, no DVD player, different colored bulbs (maybe it's just a pet peeve of mine), each bed had only two small and flat pillows each, linen was pretty rough, and the comforter had stains on them. Corners, curtains, and ceiling fan were dusty and had cob webs. Tub was cracked, tub spout would not operate properly when attempting to switch to the shower head and the shower head was weak and seemed to not operate properly as well. Shower had a soap dispenser, yet you had your choice of lime scented shampoo or lime scented shampoo. The toilet flushed like it was made by NASA and required 300 psi to propel your flush into space (sorry I'll leave the jokes out) it was loud.

The walls are pretty thin and the hotel allows pets. The WiFi is only mediocre in the lobby and pretty much non existent in the rooms. Vending machine was down and there were no other community amenities near the rooms.

For the price I'd expect at least a continental breakfast and due to the lack of activities available at the lodge, there could have been complimentary sack lunches as well (Hampton inn does this free of charge).

I guess I was expecting a camp lodge experience with campfires going to enjoy, s'mores,  and a friendly old bearded guy playing campfire songs for the guests. After all, the experience of seeing the Sequoia are a once in a lifetime experience, and I was hoping the lodging would be as well.

Lastly, if you book online you will be charged a deposit (equivalent to a one night stay), when you check out, the entire bill will be charged to your card. If you used a credit card the deposit will be credited back to your account in a couple days, if debit, 7-30 days depending on your bank.

It is apparent that businesses in these rare locations do not place customer service high on their agenda. Where else would you stay and eat so close to the Sequoia? And I guess this is why they don't have to strive so hard as other competitors.

I'm new at this review thing, though it is well overdue, customer service in this country is not what it used to be. I am not one of those guys that gives jiffy lube coffee a five star rating, and neither should the reviewers (no offense to jiffy lube coffee).

To prove my point, at the end of my stay I was greeted with my bill at the lobby and was not asked how my stay was. Not one to split hairs, but it would have been nice to be asked. Sorry wuksachi lodge, it wasn't worth the visit.

Thank you owner for acknowledging my experience, I post not only to help your business grow but to allow business owners the ability to improve and keep an edge on the corporate conglomerates that corner each market. In any business, customer experience and service should be the corner Stone to any business. Without the customer, there would be no business. The location of your lodge is in a beautiful area and I wish the best of business for you in the future! Regards JV<//Review>< Pics>

Made reservations 2 months in advance for a two night stay. Paid the first night in advance. Received a phone call at 5:30 PM while on our way to the lodge.

We thought we had fixed it, but clearly not. We have since audited all reservations in the system to avoid this in the future.

<Review>The pizza was good, however, once we had ordered the pizza, we were told to take it back to our room, at the time there was a couple eating pizza right where we wanted to eat it and the previous night, there were 5+ people eating pizza and other meals there. We asked why they were allowed and we were not and they simply said "they were misinformed". After a fair bit of reasoning, they let us stay and eat it there. There is nothing at the bar where the pizza is ordered telling you you must take it back to your room implying you could eat it there so something as simple as a sign saying "all food must be consumed elsewhere" or something along those lines would let people with the intentions of eating there let them know they can't.

The previous night, we went into the restaurant which seemed nice but, they had a very small menu. We ordered the food and it didn't come out quite right, 2 of the 4 dishes we ordered tasted both stale and burnt unfortunately.

Besides the fact that the room's furniture was dated and the linens had hair on them (white sheets and bedding would be a nice change and would improve the room), the staff were friendly and they would do what they could to help, especially the people at the reception desk<//Review>< Pics>

My family and I arrived at the hotel to check in (the reservation was made and paid for a month and a half ago) and were greeted with the response "you're reservation was canceled by us a few days ago." No sorry, no here's dinner on us, the only advice they had was that Comfort Inn 1 hour away would have a room for us. I had even called the day before to confirm my reservation, "yup you are all set sir, we look forward to seeing you tomorrow." So I drive all the way to the comfort inn to find out they are all booked up as well. So after all that we left Sequoia NP not getting to enjoy our visit like we had imagined (came all the way from Ohio). I still have not seen a refund. Don't bother reserving a room and paying for it in advance, it doesn't matter to them at all!< /review><rate>1</rate></record></dataset><record>

<review>Not a lot of options to stay in the park. Lodge is adequate but not quite what the website implies. The "lodge" is cosy but the rooms are not in that building, they are a few minutes away. Room was somewhat dated and had a weird smell. Rollaway beds and cardboard boxes lined the hallway, felt like a storage area. They make you sign a disclaimer to accept that the WiFi is poor... they should tell you before you book that it's unusable (we were relying on it to plan our itinerary). There is one restaurant, food was mixed quality (corn chowder great, potatoes among the worst I've eaten) but those who didn't make a reservation waited a while. It's nice to wake up in the forest and the price was ok compared to other national park hotels but we wouldn't rush back.<//review><Response>{'time': 1511806402513, 'text': 'Dear Nikolai,\n\nThank you for your review.

<Review>Wuksachi lodge is by far the best place to stay when visiting Sequoia National Park. It is located right inside the park and has great accomodations, rooms, food and even limited WiFi which is difficult in the mountains. A must if you are visiting Seqouia.<//Review><Date>1492750975972</Date>< userid>

<name>Travelocity reviewer< /name><Review>My girl friend and I spend a couple of night at Wuksachi Lodge 2nd week of July 2012. Following is our observations:Restaurant price is very high and quality of the food is incredibly poor. Avoid the restaurant.Bar prices are also very high. It is a highway robbery.A/C in the room was noisy and inadequate. Room was OK.Staff is friendly.ADVICE: Load up your car with beer, wine, drinks and food. STAY AWAY from Wuksachi restaurant and bar.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< gmapID>

<Text>Rate was expensive. Restaurant was awful. My server was unattentive and I ended up paying for the entree portion of the ravioli when I had specifically ordered the appetizer portion. They should take the cheese platter off the menu because the crackers and cheese I got were stale and flavorless. French onion soup is generally served with baguette and cheese on top, I was served only the broth. The reataurant tries to be five star but they fail horribly.The room was good but still too expensive. Walls are thin, I could hear all my neighbors.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80955e7bbfa947a1:0x569f3289d86ec019<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The restraunt at the lodge leaves much to be desired. The wait staff left us without water numerous times and at 5pm, were out of quite a few entree choices on the menu. We enjoyed the views here, but began to loathe dining in the restaurant every night. The dinner options were overpriced, whilr vegetarian and gluten free options were limited mostly to salads. I do not recommend the vegetarian burger or "field roast". Wi-Fi here is the slowest I have experineced. Staying in the lodge was fine, but our room had no air conditioning and no elevator. It was clean and adequate for our stay with lots of wildlife right outside our door. Deer and bears were seen by members in our party.< /Text>

<Review>There is no A/C. At night it gets cool enough that this isn't a major problem, but I still wished for it once or twice. You will have no cell coverage at all - phone, texting, data - nothing. That's true in pretty much the whole park, so nothing against the hotel, but be aware that their wifi is abysmal, so while, yes, you CAN get SOME things online, be sure to have downloaded all your maps, audio books, guides, and whatever else you were planning on using while you were here BEFORE you come. Again, the hotel probably can't get anything better, so this is more of a warning than a complaint. TIP: if you are coming as a group, consider getting long-range walkie talkies or something like that.

The water comes out of the tap at a VERY slow rate - 28.8 ml / second or .46 gallons / minute. I understand the need to conserve water, but it shouldn't take a full minute to fill up 2 water bottles.

My door didn't close all the way unless you pulled on it, which in and of itself wasn't a big deal, but lent to the general feeling that this building is older and could use a bit of a freshening up, although I acknowledge that some may find it more of a charming, quaint sort of feel and prefer it that way.

As far as I could tell, the only difference bergen the standard and deluxe rooms was that the more expensive ones are ever so slightly bigger and have a chair. Big woop - I recommend the cheaper room unless you have a need for a few extra square feet of space.

You must walk a short distance from the car to your room. Some may like the feeling of remoteness that this gives, but it isn't particularly handicap-friendly, if that's an issue for you.

The beds were comfortable, the rooms were clean, and the location was fantastic. Really, when you get right down to it, that's all that really matters, right?<//Review>< GmapID>

This is a review strictly on the reservations line not on the hotel. I booked online and had to cancel due to bad weather. After several days, I called to check on my refund of the deposit. The man on the reservation line was reluctant to assist me and was quite rude. I am in customer service myself and cancellations are unfortunate but certainly no reason to be terse.< /text>

<review>I stayed here because of its proximity to the Giant Forest at Sequoia.  There are actually no giant sequoias that I saw in the lodge area--you need to drive a few minutes down the road.  The room I stayed in was nice.  It had no air conditioning--just a window fan--but a/c wasn't needed during my stay in early August, as daytime highs were only in the low 70's.  WiFi was extremely slow, but free.  There's no cell phone signal here as of the time of this review, so you really need the WiFi if you feel the need to be connected to the outside world.  The lodge's restaurant--The Pines--was adequate (not fantastic), and the bottled beers quite expensive.  The all-you-can eat barbecue dinner at nearby Wolverton was a nice change.  Overall, a perfectly enjoyable stay.< /review><Time>1376089549319<//Time><rating>3</rating><Gmap_id>0x80955e7bbfa947a1:0x569f3289d86ec019<//Gmap_id>< user>

<review>This not Giant Forest Lodge.
It is a place to stay in Sequoia.
I found that I could rent a small RV for what they charge to stay here. Next time I will rent the RV and stay at Lodge pole. WL is pleasent enough, but the design of separate lodging buildings from lobby and reasturant make it feel like no architect was used. You cannot drive up to the front door to check in. The long paths to the lodging buildings are poorly maintained. Be prepared to lug your bags up and down stairs. Rooms could have had balconies to enjoy the lodge pole forest but the design doesn't understand that we are here to be involved with nature. The real shocker was the notice that the water does not meet California standards. Breakfast buffett was executed poorly. The food was often cold and dishes not available to serve ones self. Tables and chairs were crammed in so guests often were bumping into seated dinners.
The wifi worked well in my room, but that's not why I am here.
The beds are soft and they have no backboards.
Got rained out of Ranger talk at lodge pole and came back to dine early.  Even though there were open tables I was told I had to wait. When seated, got bread with oil but no vinigar.  Getting hot water refills while waiting for dinner was difficult.  It took 50 minutes for food to arrive.  My wife got plain dried out and cold rice instead of what was ordered.  The whole operation with armature and inefficient.  Definatly a disappointment at high prices
Update: Delaware North is wants big money for names in National Parks. The Parks and the names are our patrimony.</review>< Pics>

At check-in: "you are too early - check in is at 4 pm" without checking at all whether the room could be available.

If you plan to go there - take your own food with you or plenty of time to wait in the most chaotic restaurant of the world. I have never seen so many people running around so uncoordinated.

Rooms - ok - but attitude of staff totally unacceptable. Every Dollar spent here is too much.

I cannot understand the 5/5 ratings. Are these guys paid ?</text><Rate>1</Rate>< Pictures>

We swung by the lodge just to see it during our trip to Sequoia. We were traveling with a toddler and discovered that even if you're not staying there, it's worth a stop to enjoy the view and provide a change of pace for the kids.<//review>

Stopped by to checkout the lodge as it was mentioned in a number of guides. There is a small gift shop, a restaurant and another small food shop downstairs where you can rent snow shoes. There is nothing in the way of tourist attractions here.< /Review><Time>1451406784662</Time><Response>None< /Response>< Pics>

Service at the diner was very slow. Had to ask for refills on my water or else it would just sit empty. Don't get the wings. Worst wings ever<//Review>

No food delivery, but you can order to go from the restaurant, which closes at 8:30pm. Portions are small, but 2 kids menu items combined will be larger and cheaper than 1 regular entree.< /review>

A beacon of civilization in the wilderness of Sequoia National Park.  The dining room is usually crowded, it's expensive and the service is s-l-o-w, but after hiking 15 miles, there's nothing better than a nice sit-down meal.<//Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) We had a great time. The beauty of the park around it was amplified by a very strong snowfall of the days before which made everything even more beautiful. The structure is warm and welcoming. Our room was clean and large with a nice window facing the snowy forest upstream. I believe, given the fact that there are not many structures in the area, that it is advisable to book early ... if you have already decided a date ... certainly covid permitting.

(Original)
Siamo stati benissimo. La bellezza del parco intorno è stata amplificata da una fortissima nevicata dei giorni prima che hanno reso il tutto ancora più bello. La struttura è calda e accogliente. La nostra stanza era pulita e grande con un bella finestra verso sul bosco innevato a monte. Credo, considerato il fatto che non sono molte le strutture in zona, che sia consigliabile prenotare per tempo...se avete già deciso una data...certo covid permettendo.</Text><time>1614009771601< /time><name>amedeo sotgiu</name><Resp>None<//Resp><user_id>117142108819887765774</user_id>< GmapID>

<text>(Translated by Google) Elegant and modern mountain lodge, with very large rooms. Satisfactory cleaning. Spectacular location, right in the heart of Sequoia National Park, which in addition to being quiet at night is easy to visit by day. Very friendly and helpful sfaff.

Lodge di montagna elegante e moderno, con camere decisamente ampie. Pulizia soddisfacente.

< Review>
(Translated by Google) A haven of peace in the heart of nature. We did not meet any bears in this season, but a doe and her little ones scampered at the feet of our room.
The room and the bed are very big and comfortable. The restaurant is good. Helpful staff. No effective internet connection, but it pauses during the holidays.
At this price, the bathroom could be more modern, it feels like a basic motel.

Un havre de paix en plein cœur de la nature. Nous n'y avons pas rencontré d'ours en cette saison, mais une biche et ses petits trottinaient aux pieds de notre chambre.
La chambre et le lit sont très grands et confortables. Le restaurant est bon. Le personnel serviable. Pas de connexion internet efficace, mais ça fait une pause pendant les vacances.
A ce prix, la salle de bain pourrait être plus moderne, on a l'impression d'être dans un motel basique.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The Wuksachi Lodge unfortunately lives alone on their location. The reception was surprisingly unfriendly and they frittered you off hectic. The room was ok, but not very clean (hair on the pillows, carpet dirty). Nice was the towel, which was folded into a bear and positioned on one of the beds. Amazingly bad is the in-house restaurant: of five dishes was a cold, one was totally over-salted and was also charged too expensive. And that anyway already "salted" prices. Not surprisingly, meals went back at many tables. Only the dessert was convincing, but the service was poor: drinks were forgotten and complaints were hardly received. When we then refrained from tipping was actually asked how much tip we want to give. When we explained our intention to give none, we were briskly finished. Overall, I advise the accommodation conditionally, the food but definitely to alternatives. 2 stars only for the location and because the accommodation is basically ok.

(Original)
Die Wuksachi Lodge lebt leider allein von ihrer Lage. Der Empfang war erstaunlich unfreundlich und man wurde hektisch abgefrühstückt. Das Zimmer war ok, aber nicht ganz sauber (Haare auf den Kopfkissen, Teppichboden dreckig). Nett war das Handtuch, das zu einem Bären gefaltet und auf einem der Betten positioniert war. Erstaunlich schlecht ist das hauseigene Restaurant: von fünf Speisen wurde eine kalt serviert, eine war total versalzen und wurde auch noch zu teuer abgerechnet. Und das bei sowieso schon "gesalzenen" Preisen. Nicht verwunderlich, dass Speisen an vielen Tischen zurück gingen. Einzig der Nachtisch konnte überzeugen, jedoch war auch der Service mangelhaft: Getränke wurden vergessen und auf Beanstandungen kaum eingegangen. Als wir dann davon abgesehen haben Trinkgeld zu geben wurde tatsächlich nachgefragt wie viel Trinkgeld wir denn geben wollen. Als wir unsere Absicht keines zu geben erläuterten wurden wir forsch zu Ende bedient. Insgesamt rate ich bei der Unterkunft bedingt, beim Essen aber auf jeden Fall zu Alternativen. 2 Sterne nur für die Lage und weil die Unterkunft grundsätzlich in Ordnung ist.<//review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) During our honeymoon we stayed in this Hotel, like so many other facilities, did not offer special treatment for newlyweds. The structure is nice and clean spread over different areas, the restaurant must be booked upon arrival also because there are no alternatives in the area. We also had fun with the luggage trolley! 😁

Durante la nostra luna di miele abbiamo soggiornato in questo Hotel, come tante altre strutture non offriva un trattamento speciale per i neo sposi.

Die Lage der Unterkunft mitten im Park ist klasse.

Die hat eine Traumlage aber das war es auch schon. Alles Andere ist einfach schrecklich. Von Benutzer Bettwäsche über schmutzige Toiletten und öffentliche Bereiche über unfreundliches Personal im Housekeeping war alles unterirdisch. Das Personal im Restaurant war sehr nett. Der Zimmerpreis ist überzogen. Unser Bett müsste Nachts nach der Amreise noch neu bezogen werden, weil die Haare vom vorherigen Gast im gesamten Bett lagen. Der zuständige Mitarbeiter war extrem genervt und fragte uns mehrmals, ob wir das Bett nicht selber beziehen möchten. Nachdem wir ihm zeigten, dass die Kissen auch schmutzig sind, schlug er genervt seine Hände auf die Oberschenkel und verlies das Zimmer.< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The place is just super !!! The most convenient location for exploring the park. Great restaurant, recommend steaks. Free parking. The room is large, clean, but the sheets are shabby, holes in the bedspread. The price is a bit high, like mountains)) Check-in at 16.00. There is a coffee maker in the room, but on the second day they did not replenish the supply of coffee and tea. I recommend staying for two nights this is the best time, you will have time to inspect everything and will not waste your way from the valley to the mountains. The Internet is bad, in some places there is no alternative cellular connection, where there is no dinner. Therefore, we had dinner at the hotel restaurant. The kitchen is excellent especially steaks, better in quality is not the most expensive. Did not really like to have dinner at 17.00. another time was groaned. The problem with the places, therefore, must be recorded early.

(Original)
Место просто супер!!! Самое удобное расположение для осмотра парка. Отличный ресторан, рекомендую стейки. Свободная парковка. Номер большой, чисто, но постельное белье потрепанное, дырки в  покрывале. Цена высоковата, как горы)) Заезд в 16.00. Есть кофеварка в номере, но на Второй день не пополнили запас кофе и чая. Рекомендую остановиться на две ночи это самое оптимальное время, успеете все осмотреть и не будете тратить дорогу из долины в горы. Интернет плохой, сотовая связь местами отсутствует альтернативы, где поужинать нет. Поэтому ужинали в ресторане отеля. Кухня отличная особенно стейки, лучше по качеству не самый дорогой. Не очень понравилось ужинать в 17.00. другое время было щанято. Проблема с местами поэтому надо записываться заренее.</Review><UserId.>117260276954918124122<//UserId.>< pictures>

Donc pas de douche, pas de restaurant, pas de petit déjeuner avec deux enfants en bas âge c’est compliqué...L’hôtel rembourse si on avait réservé en direct chez eux mais hélas on est passé chez Expedia qui eux ne veulent rien savoir donc plus de 200 euros à la poubelle.

(Translated by Google) It is a pleasant hotel with mountain hotel character. Rooms in the, restaurant: open hall. But everything is and dear. Much more important is that you live here in the middle of the forest and directly has the jungle in front of the door. The great old sweetheart (🌲) can only be hiked by Peres and only in days long hikes. I also saw the (last) bear.

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>(Translated by Google) We had the expectations of a rustic, clean mountain hotel by the previous stay in the Tenaya Lodge. What Wuksachi offers, however, are by European standards a maximum of 2 stars, but all for a (European imaginary price for 4-5 stars) The reception was cold, stressed and unfriendly. The houses are relatively far away from the lodge itself. The hallways of the houses do not give the impression that they are cleaned on a regular basis. The same goes for the rooms and especially for the windows. The bathrooms are ugly and unkempt with plastic shower trays. Breakfast was ok, but served in a (very) cold dining room. I would book the next visit a hotel in the valley and for the long journey in purchase.

Wir hatten durch den vorherigen Aufenthalt in der Tenaya Lodge die Erwartungshaltung an eine rustikales, sauberes Berghotel. Was Wuksachi bietet, sind jedoch für europäische Verhältnisse maximal 2 Sterne, alles jedoch für einen (europäisch gedachten Preis für 4-5 Sterne) Der Empfang war kalt, gestresst und unfreundlich. Die Häuser sind relativ weit weg von der Lodge selbst. Die Flure der Wohnhäuser erwecken nicht den Eindruck als würden diese in regelmäßigen Abständen geputzt. Dasselbe gilt für die Zimmer und vor allem auch für die Fenster. Die Bäder sind unschön und ungepflegt mit Duschwannen aus Kunststoff. Das Frühstück war in Ordnung, wird aber in einem (sehr) kalten Speisesaal serviert. Ich würde beim nächsten Besuch ein Hotel im Tal buchen und dafür auch die lange Anfahrt in Kauf nehmen.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1572998769239, 'text': 'We deeply apologize for falling so short of your expectations.

(Translated by Google) The setting seemed perfect if we could enjoy it! After 7 hours drive we discover that the hotel was wrong in the booking date. They did nothing to correct their mistake as we found another hotel at their expense which was the minimum! And the height? No excuses were made to us! Unpleasant and pedantic team unable to properly handle their customers. At your peril !

(Original)
Le cadre semblait parfait si nous avions pu en profiter ! Après 7h de route nous découvrons que l'hôtel s'est trompé dans la date de réservation. Ils n'ont rien fait pour corriger leur erreur comme nous trouver un autre hôtel à leur frais ce qui était le minimum ! Et le comble ? Aucune excuse ne nous a été faite ! Équipe désagréable et pédante incapable de s'occuper correctement de leur clientèle. A vos risques et périls !<//review>

<review>(Translated by Google) We would have been originally with 5 people-Fortunately, we were at check-in then only 4 of the original 2 rooms, of course, we were fully booked half a year ago, was only a room in the system noted. We had to squeeze us to 4 in a room with small sofa bed. The lodge now stated afterwards that the reservation was a different name, although we checked all the names on the spot. Now it is difficult to get the money back. Unfortunately, an Italian family who arrived on the same day in the evening was worse off. Their room was not available at all and they had to drive 50km to the next accommodation late in the evening. Apparently you have to adjust to it

(Original)
Wir wären ursprünglich mit 5 Personen unterwegs gewesen-Zum Glück waren wir beim Check-in dann nur noch 4. von den ursprünglich 2 Zimmern, die uns natürlich vollständig 1/2 Jahr vorher abgebucht wurden, war nur ein Zimmer im System vermerkt. Wir mussten uns dann zu 4 in ein Zimmer mit kleiner Ausziehcouch quetschen. Die Lodge gab jetzt im Nachhinein an, dass die Reservierung auf einen anderen Namen lieg, obwohl wir vor Ort alle Namen kontrolliert haben. Jetzt ist es schwierig das gezahlte Geld zurück zu bekommen. Einer Italienischen Familie, die erst abends am gleichen Tag ankamen erging es leider noch schlechter. Ihr Zimmer war überhaupt nicht verfügbar und sie mussten nach spät abends 50km zur nächsten Unterkunft fahren. Scheinbar muss man sich darauf einstellen< /review>< Pictures>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>(Translated by Google) Obviously the park is beautiful, I went in March and I had snow, everything looked very nice. The rooms of the hotel are expensive and the quality of the mattresses is not very good, but if you are looking for a place in the highest part of the mountains that is a good option, because in the lower parts of the mountain there was no snow . The hotel restaurant also too expensive, not so rich. However, one understands that what you are paying is not the hotel but the landscape.

Obviamente el parque es hermoso, fui en marzo y me tocó nieve, todo se veía muy lindo. Los cuartos del hotel son carísimos y la calidad de los colchones no es muy buena, pero si buscas un lugar en lo más alto de las montañas esa es muy buena opción, pues en las partes más bajas de la montaña ya no había nada de nieve. El restaurante del hotel también demasiado caro, no está tan rico.

(Translated by Google) Expensive 250 € the night. From the outside like the old log cabins in Ahlhorn. Inside, dark rooms with standardized amenities. No air conditioning. Good: big fridge. Needed because there are only very, very, very limited shopping possibilities. The plant lives only from the proximity to the mammoth trees. Due to the location still 3 stars.

Teuer 250€ die Nacht. Von aussen wie die alten Blockhütten in Ahlhorn. Innen dunkle Zimmer mit standardisierter Ausstattung. Keine Klimaanlage. Gut: Großer Kühlschrank.

Buon ristorante, stufa accesa, terrazza panoramica. Fa anche da albergo. Peccato che eravamo di fretta.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) You are in search of a snow experience. I found it an unforgettable one. A quaint hotel in the middle of the park, a real dive.

We experienced the rudest check-in in almost 40 years of travelling around the world. The lady at the front desk told us in an arrogant and smug tone that the phones are not working, the internet will be slow due to a satellite link and that we have to remove all food from the car. Later when we inquired about breakfast options the same lady showed us her total unwillingness to give us the infos - as we interrupted her chat with coworkers. One of the guests helped out. As we didnt want to see these folks again we went to Lodgepole for food and other needs.The lodge is in a great location in the middle of the national park not far from the huge trees. The room was basic but clean. But the stairs and aisles were dirty. Broken phones and a lousy internet might be ok in Africa last century but not in the US today.And we expected a quiet night in the forest but the noise from the ventilation system keeps you up half of the night. We would definitely not return.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Rather dated room without any charm
HS air conditioning
Bathroom in its own juice

The restaurant opens at 7 a.m. and closes at 9 a.m.
You have to stand in line for 3 hours

Not much to remember from this hotel which benefits from its location in the center of the park
Like many others elsewhere

(Original)
Chambre plutôt vieillotte sans aucun charme
Climatisation HS
Salle de bain dans son jus

Le restaurant ouvre a 7h et ferme a 9h
Il faut faire là queue pendant 3 h

Pas grand chose a retenir de cette hôtel qui profite de sa situation au centre du park
Comme beaucoup d’autre d’ailleurs</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Great service!
We arrived at midnight because we never imagined how long the climb would take us, they welcomed us and hosted us.

We ran into a small deer and its mother in the same place about 5 meters away!

They need to pay attention to the dining room, little attention but I would still return.

Buen servicio!

<Review>(Translated by Google) It's fine to be so far from civilization. But they say they have wifi when only hotel employees can access, that is, you are almost totally cut off. They do not know how to say well if the use of chains corresponds to a day of snow. The cleanliness of the rooms is somewhat poor. The restaurant is very good!, Both at night and at breakfast. The supermarket is a bit far away and they have few things in the hotel.

(Original)
Esta bien para estar tan lejos de la civilización. Pero dicen tener wifi cuando solo los empleados del hotel pueden acceder, es decir que estás casi totalmente incomunicado. No te saben decir bien si corresponde el uso de cadenas un dia de nieve. La limpieza de las habitaciones es un tanto pobre. El restaurante es muy bueno!, tanto por la noche como en el desayuno. El supermercado esta un tanto lejos y tienen pocas cosas en el hotel.< /Review>< Pictures>

The room I was in had two queen beds very comfortable. The hot bath water was very good and in addition the room service was excellent. I should mention that when you stay in Wuksachi you only have the option of having breakfast, lunch and dinner in the restaurant of the place. It is a little expensive, but waiting to get good food in such a repoto place. The dining options specifically were very good. Breakfast not so good. And lunch I can not comment since I did not treat it. Finally it is important to remember chains for the tires of the car during the winter since the snowfalls are common during the cold season.

Lugar hermoso para hospedarse y lograr hacer varias caminatas en el parque influyendo Moro Rock, Sunset Rock, Topokah Valley y por supuesto visitar al secoya mas voluminoso llamado General Sherman. La habitación en la cual estuve tenía dos camas tamaño queen muy comodas. El agua del baño caliente estuve muy buena y adicionalmente el servicio del cuarto fue excelente. Debo mencionar que al hospedarse en Wuksachi uno solo tiene la opción de desayunar, almorzar y cenar en el restaurante del lugar. Es un poco caro, pero esperando para obtener buena comida en un lugar tan repoto. Las opciones de cenar específicamente fueron muy buenas. El desayuno no tan bueno. Y de almuerzo no puedo comentar ya que no lo traté. Finalmente es importante recordar cadenas para las llantas del auto durante el invierno ya que las nevadas son comunes durante la temporada fria.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) It is located at the top of the mountain, only strategic by the views. One is almost forced to eat there because of how complicated and late it is to get there. The lobby is far from the rooms. The door of my room did not close and the heating was bad.

Esta en ubicado en lo más alto de la montaña, únicamente estratégico por las vistas. Uno esta casi obligado a comer ahí por lo complicado y tardío que es llegar hasta allí. El lobby esta muy lejos de las habitaciones. La puerta de mi cuarto no cerraba y la calefacción andaba mal.<//text>
