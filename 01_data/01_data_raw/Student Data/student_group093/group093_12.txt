I initially went in for a pedicure manicure with gel! I was not happy with the outcome of my pedicure. This was a wasted $55. My toe's nails are cut uneven. The gel polish is completely off of my big toes. There is no wag that gel polish should come off. And this all happened a few hours after leaving. After looking at my feet. I paid and left and went elsewhere for my manicure.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Went in for the first time for pink and white ombre and it wasn't done well. The blending isn't good and you can see where the white acrylic still is under the pink. Just looks like a straight white and then pink. Maybe the nail tech didn't know how to do it ? And missed spots with the acrylic.< /Text>

<text>I’ve been going to this Salon since before Melissa became the owner and she’s really turned it around. They are always accommodating and courteous and that’s not all. They all do great work everyone is always very nice I wouldn’t go any where else in the AV!< /text>< pics>

<review>I am a First time customer. I will be returning. All good vibes, good service, complementary water and they really listen to all my specific pedicure details. They repeated back my requests, that makes me know they are really attentive. I will also look into working with the owners husband regarding real estate. I pray each visit is as nice as today’s visit.< /review>< pictures>

<text>Extremely rude people. They refuse to speak any english. For the most part they were nice to me, but clients coming in not so much. They would tell people one price at the door then change it during check out. Of course clients would get upset.

Poor customer service, I went to get a basic pedicure yesterday afternoon around 1 p.m.
The lady that did my pedicure had attitude the whole time.  and then I got my toenails painted one toenail blue and the rest White when I didn't like the blue and asked you to change it she attempted to put the white nail polish over the blue. When i asked to just take it off she. Said something under her breath and told me to wait 5 mins. I told her i was on my lunch break i didnt have time she got more upset and rushed and did it over not even taking all of the blue off didnt apply a top coat. Im very disappointed because i work in the area and i was looking for a new shop to go to. But i will never step foot back in here. Very unprofessional.</review>

Small market can hardly move but meat is good. If you buy $30 or more you get a free item. In addition, it stacks so if you buy $90 you get 3 free items.</review>

<Review>Terence was my salesman at the store. He thoroughly explained the features of the beds that I was interested in. When we came to pricing I realized that it was out of my budget. So he proceeded to show me a little lower price mattresses. He found one online with almost the same features as the latest ones.For me when there is Great service and a great product it Has to be given a five star rating. I’ll come back here the next time. Thank you< /Review><userid>111601024322877451980</userid>< user_name>

<Review>We went to Mattress Firm (Fremont Curie St location) to pick a mattress for our parents. We were assisted by Nasir Naeem.

We would highly recommend him and this location  place to anyone looking for their mattress needs.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>My experience with Nasir at Mattress Firm was better than I could have asked for. He was so kind and patient in helping me pick out the perfect mattress to suite my needs. He went above and beyond! I highly recommend if you’re in need of a new mattress to come here, not only do they not rush you in your decision, they don’t try to upsale you. In fact, I had quite the opposite experience, he did his best to fit my budget and provided promotions to everything I purchased. I can’t recommend this place enough!< /text><resp>{'time': 1620497652053, 'text': "Thank you Mikaela for taking the time to leave us a review about your experience with Nasir in our Pacific Commons location!

Safety measures in store were implemented very well! Nasir was so helpful and knowledgeable about the mattresses and he helped me find the best comfortable mattress and arranged a delivery after I explained my moving situation. I cannot emphasize enough that he made my mattress purchasing experience perfect. I genuinely hope he gets some sort of raise because he 100% deserves it. If you see this Nasir, I hope you’re having a great day!</review>

<Text>Nasir was friendly and helpful, worked with me on delivery and warranty. But after paying for my mattress he said the warranty I purchased didn’t cover exchanges, this is what I paid the warranty for. Unethical way to do business, I know it’s a mattress store but seriously? On top of high pressure pushy attitude towards add on items. Spoke to manager and he said due to the mattress being pre owned there’d be no exchanges allowed except for defective mattresses. Unbelievably shady of them to change the conditions of warranty AFTER the transaction had been made. Very displeased with how the final stages of this transaction went.< /Text>< Date>

<text>During this pandemic it is a challenge to decide what places may be safe to patronize. I needed to get a new pillow for my disabled brother. Keith was great and he was very careful to follow best practices while answering all of my questions. I ended up buying the pillow and an adjustable bed frame. He was very professional, answered my questions and was helpful without being pushy. Thank you Keith.</text></record></dataset><record>
<review>We are relocating to Hawaii and stopped by a Mattress Firm store to test out the Purple mattress before buying. Nasir was informative, friendly, and diligent in helping us get the mattress we wanted shipped to our new home in Hawaii. It was complicated by a number of factors and we were so impressed by his follow through to make this work for us during a very stressful move. Thanks!< /review>< GmapID>

<Review>I was in the market for a new mattress set and happened into my local Mattress Firm in Fremont, Pacific Commons,  and was very pleased with the entire process. I was greeted by Keith, a very knowledgeable and professional employee. He was more concerned with me finding the right mattress than making a sale which I really appreciated. We settled in a few choices and after bringing my husband back for the final decision, we purchased. Keith made sure we took advantage of the sales and I can’t wait to try out the mattress. I would highly recommend this location if you are in the market fo a new mattress. Ask for Keith too!</Review>< pictures>

It was a great experience with Fremont store. The main reason for us to visit store than to buy online was to try out different mattress before buying it. We tried few different mattress and could finalize on one. Store Manager also let us know about promotions going on and gave us some amazing discount in the end.<//Text>

Keith the store manager is extremely helpful in getting me to find the perfect mattress at the right price. He accomplishes this without resorting to pressure tactics and gimmicks that some car and other sales people deploy. In fact, I was turned off by the sales tactic at the Mattress Firm in Milpitas Square next to Best Buy and came to buy from Keith instead. Delivery and setup took about 15 minutes.<//text>

<Time>1596066605211</Time><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>I been wanting a new bed with an adjustable base for quite some time. After doing my shopping at Target, I had an instinct to check if Mattress Firm was open: they were! I was greeted by Sales Associate Keith Alexander Hendrickson, who I felt was the right person there at the right time to help sell me on my perfect bed. I told him I had some available credit to work with but wouldn’t mind paying a bit out of pocket if it made his job easier and I found the right bed and base. I was impressed by his Q&A note taking as he was figuring out what bed and base would suit me. I was able to test a couple of beds to get a feel of what would be best for my back. An added bonus was he recommended a pillow he felt would help me sleep better. It was as if he answered my prayers: the pillow I tried was the perfect pillow for my head and neck!! I had been on the look for years but couldn’t find one until he suggested I give it a try! Long story short, Keith and I established a rapport that felt as if he were long lost friends catching up on old times. His recommendations were detailed exactly to what I needed and his stellar interpersonal customer service skills sold me on my choice! I came to Mattress Firm looking for a bed but what I got was a lifestyle change. My purchase included a Firm full size bed with a high quality adjustable base, a new set of sheets (decorative and protective), 2 new pillows, everything needed to finally get the best sleep I’ve had in a long time. You can’t put a price on a friendly purchase from a great guy like Erik, and though he tried his very best to stay within my preferred budget, I had no problem making a little wiggle room for his suggestions because he tailored everything I needed and wanted. Outstanding associates like Erik who makes you feel like  a friend are hard to come by. If you need to improve your sleep and you want to be and feel seen and heard, Mattress Firm is your go to place!! Be sure to get Erik, he will sell you on a lifestyle that will change the way you experience sleep tailored to, as Journey sings, “Any way you want it, that’s the way you need it!!”<//Text>< gmapID>

<text>Went in on a week night was greeted by Nasir right away & given a sheet protector for mattress trying COVID style. We knew what we were looking for (Tempurpedic) but he was sure to show us all our options. He was very good with all sanitizing procedures. He was very kind & attentive, giving us full attention even though he had another couple to assist who thankfully waited patiently. I was hesitant to shop for a mattress during the pandemic but I now even feel safe sending in my 84 yo Grandmother as she's also due for a mattress. Will definitely recommend this location to others too.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

It’s the kind heartiness of the sales person at the Fremont store #502111, Nasir Naeem. Not pushy or over sales. He listens and cares about his customers.< /text>

I went into this location looking for plush mattresses, and Keith was very quick to help look for plush mattresses in my price point. He was also very helpful when recommending what type of bed frames and box springs to pair along with the mattress. I would recommend this location when shopping around for different types of mattresses to figure out what would best suit your needs and lifestyle.< /Review>

Keith Alexander is the sales associate you want to see if you need a good mattress, box spring, or bases.  He is very knowledgeable in recommending mattresses, box spring, or bases that will fit you and your budget... and a good sense of humor!</Review>

I couldn’t have asked for a better mattress purchasing experience.

Only feedback is I would recommend staffing more than one sales person on the floor at a given time. This was my second time coming to the store and I still had to wait for the sales person to finish up with the previous customer. Given that sales are quite lengthy for mattresses, this ended up with a longer than preferred wait time.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>This is a Newer Mattress firm store next to the Target on Auto Mall. I've been to a few different mattress stores lately and this one had the best customer service hands down. Ryan was able to help me find a bed perfect for me and I got an awesome adjustable frame to go with it. They also have a great selection of pillows you can try out while testing all the different beds, I almost took a quick nap 😂<//Review><pics>None< /pics><date>1549133064602< /date>< Response>

We couldn't be happier with our new mattress purchase and experience!   We shopped around quite a bit before walking into this new mattress firm location.  The staff here is friendly, helpful, and extremely knowledgeable.  We didn't feel pressured to buy at all and we got a great deal.  I highly recommend this location for your next mattress purchase.<//Review>

We purchased our mattress from Mattress Firm on January 7th. Keith Alexander Hendrickson was very helpful and knowledgeable. The mattress was delivered on Monday 13th and we are very happy with it. The delivery was also great, they called the night before delivery and then called again to give an update shortly before delivery. They were very professional and helpful.< /text>

I purchased my first Tempurpedic bed this past year from the Mattress Firm location in South Fremont. What a great experience! Keith, the salesman, was very knowledgeable on the products, and extremely patient with me, as I tried out several beds over the course of several days. Going to a Tempurpedic for the first time was a big decision for me. I will never go back to another type of mattress again! I purchased the Proadapt Medium mattress, and it is amazingly comfortable. Would highly recommend this product, location, and sales experience!< /Text>

I recently purchased a mattress from this new Mattress Firm location. Overall, it was a great experience. The store is brand new and super clean. They have a good selection and I got a great deal on a Beautyrest california king -- best price for the model that I found anywhere (including all of the online sites). Their sales reps were helpful without being pushy which I appreciated. I'd highly recommend this store.</text>

< Review>
My son has now been at Kang’s Sunrise Taekwondo for four years now. In this time he has not only learned taekwondo and become a Blackbelt but he also has developed discipline, confidence and self defense. He is now part of the Leadership program and is working on teaching the younger students which further helps his confidence and leadership skills. My six year old daughter has also joined and after watching her brother for years is very excited to be learning taekwondo as well. It helps her with focus, body and mind control, memorizing a sequence of steps and following directions. These skills have already helped her improve in school as well. We are very happy with Master Kang and his teaching techniques. He not only focuses on training the body but also the mind. I would recommend Kang’s Sunrise Taekwondo to everyone.<//Review>

I bring both my kids here and they love it! Their focus and confidence has really improved since being here. I would definitely recommend bringing your kids to learn here. I’m considering taking the adult classes too!</Text>

Since we have put Benjamin in this program he has a better understanding of the meaning of goals. He looks forward and excited  about learning at the age of 6 and achieving goals. Master Kang is a great instructor and very positive influence . .<//review>

<Review>Master Kang spends time and puts in the effort to show discipline, proper technique and makes it fun for the kids. My daughter's attitude and confidence has changed for the better since she started her classes 5 months ago. I would recommend this place for anyone wanting to have their kids spend time and energy into developing their minds and body in a positive way.</Review>< Pics>

We have thoroughly enjoyed having our daughter in Kang’s Sunrise Taekwondo!  It has helped with her attitude and behavior as she wants to do well to do well in her class with Master Kang.  We also appreciate that she is learning self-defense in a fun, learning environment!  We highly recommend this school to anyone who would like their child to learn confidence along with respect and honor!</review>

We have now been here for 4 months every class. Our son is three and we wanted to put him in something to take up some energy. We didn't know at the time how much more it would give our son then just an outlet for energy. They have a policy for not only the studio but respect at home as well. Our son has more consistent manners,  better listening skills, and is much better to his brother. Master Kang is an excellent instructor. He provides discipline but also patience. He works extremely well with the individual children to tailor to their needs. We couldn't have asked for a better studio.<//Text><name>Jessica Abundis<//name><Resp>{'time': 1508866890810, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the review!!'}</Resp>< gmapID>

My two boys have been training with Master Kang for over 6 months and I've seen really good results.  My older tweenager has improved in his fitness level and in his home behavior. His goal is to become a black belt master. My little one had greater needs both physically and in confidence. His doctor has noticed his increased muscle development and better balance.  His confidence and focus at  school has really improved.   He's now applying black belt attitude in all he does. We are very thankful to Mr. Kang for his patience, humor, and the way he makes each child feel that "I'm the best!".  This studio gives each child a highly individualized attention and results. I highly recommend it.</Text>

<review>My son (4 years old) started Taekwondo with Master Kang about 3 months ago. My son absolutely loves his classes. I appreciate that on top of focusing on skill and technique Master Kang also emphasizes on respect and lessons on personal safety (for the younger kids).  In fact, after observing my sons classes, my daughter (13 years) joined their adult and teen classes. Since joining, I’ve notice a positive change in both of my children’s attitude in school and at home. I would definitely recommend this program for kids, teens and adults!<//review><name>Natalie Candelaria</name></record></dataset><record>

My son has been taking classes with Master Kang for about 10 months and since enrolling, my son has drastically made improvements in  his behavior and academics at school.   Master Kang style of teaching is firm yet fun for his students. My son is learning discipline and is focusing on achieving black belt status. Taekwando has made a positive change in my son’s life and we are extremely happy we enrolled him at Sunrise Taekwando.< /Review>

This has been a great experience for our son and he really enjoys class and looks forward each day when it's  time to attend class.  He has learned many positive   skills necessary in everyday life; respect , self-esteem, self-control  and  much, much more!

We are very glad we enrolled him and look forward to watching him grow and continue to  learn additional skills that  help him at school and at  home  Master Kang is a wonderful teacher  and we intend to keep our son enrolled for years to come.< /Text>

I have two kids who go here.  They love being there everytime they go.  Master Kang is outstanding instructor.  He makes it lots of fun and exciting.  He is also very good with little kids. I have seen a BIG difference in my children confidence, attitude and abilities.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...

My kids have been at Mr Kangs Classes for many months now and I do see a vast improvement in their confidence, attitude and behaviour.</Text>

<Review>Master Kang certainly is the best Taekwondo master in town of Whittier!
His discipline program is by far the most extraordinary and beyond your expectations in your children!< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Master Kang is exceptional with his students. He teaches them respect, discipline, and honesty in a very child friendly manner making it easy to see the improvement in child development, while learning self defense. My sister Ashley Lievano has been in his classes for 6 months now, and has shown drastic improvement in self awarness, discipline and confidence. She has continually been ascending in belt class and really enjoys the learning process. Highly recommended place.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>My daughter has been a student of Master Kang for about 4 months now and I have seen a lot of progress in her. Master Kang is an excellent instructor and unlike most taekwondo studios, he actually teaches all the classes. I would HIGHLY recommend this studio.< /Review><time>1504193347128<//time><user>114180884709402936390</user><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rating>

My daughter Carina has only been a member since October but even within that time she has shown so much growth in her self-confidence! We were looking for an activity that would help her with "break out of her shell".  From the first day, Mr. Kang introduced her to the rest of the class and created a nurturing, comfortable environment.  She almost instantly flourished!  She absolutely loves it and her self-confidence is growing every day! She’s slowly “breaking out of her shell” and is finally beginning to believe in her own strength like we always have.  Master Kang is very approachable and teaches the classes in a way that is fun for the kids; he makes them eager to put forth their best! Kang’s Sunrise Tae Kwon Do is AWESOME 🤩🤩<//text>

Thank you Master Kang! You have been part of my son'a growth! I He started with you as a very shy 4 year old and has blossom into a confident 7 old. The journey hasn't been easy but I know I can always count on you to ground him when he is acting out either at home and/or school, and for this I will  always be thankful , thank you Master Kang for not giving up on my son and always pushing him to do his best! So looking forward for the next couple of months and see my baby accomplish his goal and get his black belt!</review>

<username>Rodney Vallo< /username><Pics>None< /Pics><text>Our 5 year old son has been going here for around 6 months and enjoys it up to this day. Master Kang not only teaches Taekwondo styles but also the discipline that is needed.
He makes his classes fun but at the same time serious enough for them to learn what is needed.

Not only do we like how he teaches the class, we like how he continues to teach kids confidence in themselves. He also teaches the importance of a good attitude/behavior they need to show during class and most importantly when outside of class. Respect is also a main teaching in his class.

At home we always remind our son, when his behavior falters (as normal with kids), if that is in line with Master Kang's teachings, and if it is something Master Kang and we as parents should be expecting. Whenever that happens, our son has been more aware of what is the correct attitude and behavior.

If you read other reviews, you can see it is great for kids in that he has a reward system which the kids love. It helps show progress and makes it fun for the kids to do their best in each class.

The most important facet of all this is it that our son has fun. That is what makes him want to go to as many classes as he can during the week.

For anyone interested, please give the trial period a chance. I believe it may be a very low cost and it will help you make the decision on if you and/or your kid will like it.

In all honesty, one may think that pricing may be high (which I thought at first) but since he has started, we have no regrets. It's worth what our son is learning and the fun he is having. We actually even enrolled him a few months ago in the Black Belt Club where it involves additional classes that provide more training in other aspects of Taekwondo. It costs a little more but our son really enjoys going to class. Master Kang does expect a little more from his students in those classes which is understood.<//text>< response>

I have to say that master kang is a very good master, 👍 To this man for all the hard work and dedication he puts into our kids, my 2 boys ate so doing so great and they love it! Their are times when I am tired and tell my self boy I don't think I can make it today, but when I see Ezekiel and Daniel dress and ready to go to takewondo to start their lessons my tiredness goes away! The boys love it! Ezekiel had self esteem problems and now he doesn't! Daniel had disrespected issues and not wanting to listen to simple things, now he has so much more respect!! I'm so pleased that my boys have finally found what they love, and master kang they master they have learned so much!! Thank you! I absolutely love this program!👍👍<//Review>

She's been to one other tae kwon do facility before and there's a huge difference in teaching methods. Master Kangs no comparison, his teaching techniques shows in all the students and his focus to each individual students are amazing. Strongly recommend to anyone interested.< /review>< user>

<Text>My child has been attending Master Kang's school just shy of six months and loves it. My child is an active kid, talks a lot, has attention issues and this program has really helped with a lot of behavioral hurdles that we have faced in the past year. Kang's Sunrise Taekwondo in three words:  Respect, discipline, and fun!

Master Kang has a knack for making his classes fun for the younger kids (my own included). He is steadfast, yet fun and playful, but most definitely knows when to lay down the hammer when need be. All of the children that I have seen attend his class adore him, but most importantly - they respect him as well.

Part of the curriculum that I enjoy as a parent is that each student is held accountable for their behavior at school, at home, and at the studio. Master Kang is very diligent about checking with each parent /guardian on how his students are doing in the other areas of their lives. I personally have no problems tattle telling on my child if she's been disrespectful at home or getting in trouble in school. Master Kang has addresses issues using firm warnings with my own child and takes appropriate steps to keep the children accountable. He also uses praise and uses a color belt stripe system as a check up on progress of each student. Good behavior awards stripes on belts to acknowledge good behavior, all of which are viewable to other students, so it's very public who is and who is not doing well.

The proof that I know that my daughter loves it is she is always excited to come to class, her self esteem has improved, has made friends and likes Master Kang. He aims to help his students build leadership skills and definitely has a firm hand while conducting classes, but he still knows how to motivate and have fun. I have nothing but praise for this school and Master Kang and have spoken to other parents, and who agree and have the same outlook.

Highly recommend attending this school!</Text>< Pictures>

As soon as you rate us, Google provides information about the person that rated us. Anthony Garcia, it seems like you\'ve never had any interaction with our school whatsoever.

This place is perfect for a late night bite after clubbing or bar hopping the pizza was great. The place does get crowded so if you can find a seat great, I would say that service was fast and friendly. I would definitely recommend this place as a last stop before calling it a night.</Review>

<review>Pizza is decent, service is terrible.  They serve New York style pizza that is heated to order.  Prices are average.  You can't make changes to your pizza, you have to pay for sauce, drinks are over priced, and no bathroom.   If your drunk its good, if not go elsewhere.  I prefer Marcello's down the block.<//review>< Pics>

I love bringing my family to Nizario's. I have lived in the city for many years and this is by far the best pizza in San Francisco. The staff is friendly, the food is high quality, and I honestly can't say enough good things about this pizza place.< /text>

It is a frequent choice for a late nite meal especially after a late night in or around Castro. There aren't a lot of choices when the bars close and Orphan Andy's is usually packed with a ridiculous wait, so Nizario's has a niche and fits it well. Cheap, fast, and filling, they get the job done. The staff is pleasantly amusing. No thrills no frills pizza when you can't find anything else to eat.< /Text>

<review>The skinny guy at the counter only heat your pizza slice well if you give them a tip otherwise you will get half done heated pizza I experienced this twice . I posted this review when I was eating there I dont want to reveal my identity so the next time I visit I get more worse service by your staff I really like your pizza but since you guys being owner and cannot afford to sit there all time then we Customers have to bear the poor service by your staff. Since there is no option to reply back on your comment  so am just editing my review again< /review>< Pics>

The Castro isn't a food destination, its a drinking destination- and when drinking in the castro nothing to get those munchies taken care of than Nizarrios. Thick slices, quick seevice, and yes you will have to wait if you go in at 2 am when all the bars let out so just quit dancing 10 minutes early and u can avoid the crowds.</Text>

Decent pizza - not amazing, not awful. There are plenty of other good pizza places in SF, but this is one of those joints with a specific purpose: drunk pizza. After dancing your heels off in the wee hours with the gays, there is nothing like a greasy piece of pizza. And Nizario's is happy to fulfill that request.< /Review>

One of the great by the slice places in the Castro. It's on 18th St. The entrance is small so you could miss it if you're not careful (or intoxicated :) )  Pro Tip: Always ask what's the next pie coming out. And then order a slice from that pie.

I really like being able to see what pizzas they have ready and then getting a quick slice. Sometimes the music's a little too loud, but hey, I guess that's how they keep the employees energized.

Pizza's a little thinner than the other nizario's, but it's still good.< /review>

The prices are fair and slices are usually ready and on stand by; they put them back in the office for a couple minutes when you order to get it nice and hot again.

Pizzas are great.  It's better to wait for the ones coming right out of the oven then those sitting on the counter< /review>

They serve a very solid piece of pizza, but your odds of getting a clean table or smiling face are low. I like their pre-made pizza options that are ready if you want to grab a quick slice and it's awesome that the price is so low. As long as you're not looking for a place to sit down and spend some time with friends, this is a decent option.< /review>

The crust has great flavor, the rest of the pizza is just as good. The guys arent the friendliest, but who cares? Their pizza is really worth it.</text>

Nizario’s in my opinion is by far the best pizza place in the city, the ingredients are always fresh and the crust is perfect, I always have great interactions with all of the staff, the only down side to this review is the lack of space this location has, not very much room and on a Friday or saturday night it’s usually packed shoulder to shoulder and out the door with people.</text>

This is the place to be after the bars close in the Castro!! Speaking of which you have to have a slice of the Castro pizza!! It's so good and this is the only Nizario's in the city that you can get it and not to mention it's much better than the Mission one. The service is always pretty prompt even when there's a line out the door you can get your food pretty fast perfect for beer munchies.</review>

Went there a few days ago and the owner of the place was EXTREMELY RACIST towards me. Just because I was wearing black skin, the owner decided to call me racial slurs and kept referring to me as a "Trihard' as well.. I don't know what that means but obviously it's some sort of derogatory term. I will not be coming back here.<//Review>

Terrible experience. Manager literally grabbed me and threw me out of the restaurant for my phone ringing. I'm literally shaking. The pizza is very generic and expensive for pizza tasting like it was microwaved. Very poor service!< /text>

It is a nice store but the customer service is horrible, I bought some outfits but I wanted to change it for another size, when I went back they told me that they don't rake returns and have to come back another time, I called the store 4 days in a row, but they don't take returns, such a bad customer service, I'm so disappointed, think I just wasting my time and money, hope the corporate office will change this soon!<//text>

<Review>Absolutely love shopping here , Everytime I go to Sac I always make an attempt to visit the store , I truly wish they could put a Citi trends in Redding, CA . But this visit to the store didn't have much of a selection for men's pants in the size I needed this time .
But I love this store and the clothing they have< /Review>< Pics>

<review>They close earlier than the sign and web site says. If u trying to get something cute i recommend going to dds discount their store actually closes on the time it says. I dont even want to give them a star.< /review><gmapID>0x809ad79048253c5f:0x3d92f3d67768297c</gmapID><username>Ana Mcguire< /username><Date>1490576464894< /Date>< Response>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>A wholly enjoyable experience indeed. The restaurant takes reservations, so we were immediately seated upon arrival and offered drinks. As we hesitated between 2 wines, they let us try both and make an informed choice; one rarely gets that in a restaurant of this price range. We ended up picking Lodi Cabernet, which everyone enjoyed.
The starters were crab cake and watermelon salad. Crab cake was quite and it was served on a bed of what seems to be a mixture of strained yogurt and feta - an unusual combination but not at all bad. The watermelon salad also had lightly pickled radishes, some greens and was topped with farmer's cheese, which was a bit too salty. What I most liked about this salad was the roasted almond tasting, pesto-like paste on the bottom, which turned out to be toasted pistachios with herbs.
Main courses were as follows:
*In-house made gnocchi with some herbs, Brussels Sprouts and more farmer's cheese - a good choice but again a bit saltier that it could have been. *Seared scallops, which were just OK. Usually those tend to be overdone but in this case they were a bit under, yet not as tender as they should be.
*Beef cheek - Yummy! Very well prepared, balanced sauce, seasoned to perfection and served with some mashed taters - hit the spot!
Desserts were good - apple pie with ice cream (made at premises), an interesting interpretation of mud pie, with some coffee flavored ice cream and last, berries with pistachio ice cream which I think was the best choice.
The ambiance was relaxed and many of the people seemed to be repeat customers, which says a lot about a place. Staff were very helpful and informed and ingredients fresh and inventively used.
We all really enjoyed the experience and would definitely like to come back and try more of the chef's creations.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOY0b9K-0E7z42xHU7aM4kp72_J1vzhMPfeZa4Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9yGCuXELDg9drE_xmzOlnIZXXde0veUZoKVrc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHvJBIqFJ0BDflGoZinKdYq4BMiIhqaACB57iT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8NRLjTnu1SivUARV_TnuPFkT5z41mQzxs3g1a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP78L0e4chilwVwJ7HVw8UxSQc5nr9Xblkn_92I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHydfYE6bNMkWEV5l7sOcm1wmrJDoPc-iyTNVk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmGBWVwGHMmIxRQHZOV51HjbyX4Tq4Abhz_hjM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgB_Uk9JahEqgUIxI74IYk-pyaSHRMAJ9Qmifz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOreCvrBajzCQRJ9huZmmREXaC4qJLQPRNhfzCH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5JL4LJElKgB3E9iy3n6ZLKCTkSF2Iad2L19ra=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbxQUWd8vxFbTXtfNclKIxkLoJhdRcirT6vX-W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMo1YUk_qCjgMrGA5fbovDROhmR__cCrWS7AAuO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80d9551da49011df:0xfd9929fc5837b435<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Excellent place in every way.  We have visited twice now.  This is a high end comfort food place... It's small, so I recommend getting reservations if you plan to visit 6 pm or after.  The fried chicken breast is amazing!  Also love the meat loaf... Sounds funny saying that but it's true.  They have a small but curated wine list full of great offerings.  Service is also excellent..  very personal and professional.  Next time you are in University Heights, come visit me at my studio... Then head over to Circa for a really great experience.</text>

<user_id>114278129402058697803< /user_id><review>Circa is a hidden gem. We stopped here on a whim, and fell in love with the cozy, laid back, sophisticated atmosphere. Our waiter was a delight, as was the food. I had the scallops, and my partner had the chicken skillet. Both were well prepared, and the perfect portion. We also indulged in dessert, which was not a mistake! The creme brulee was wonderful, and paired nicely with dessert wine. We were pleasantly surprised to see Hauner on the menu, have just visited a few weeks before! Circa is a lovely date spot, or a nice place to catch up with old friends. We highly recommend.< /review><Time>1544451488181< /Time><Response>None<//Response>< Pictures>

First off, the Staff is so friendly they make you feel right at home in this cozy neighborhood joint.

The patio (and staff) is dog friendly and they even brought a dog water bowl (and treats) out for my dog.

The happy hour here can’t be beat! The sangria is bomb and their beer selection is on point.  But come here for the food, it’s out of this world good. We had everything on the happy hour menu and it was all equally fantastic.< /Text>

We were on our way to eat next door but thought we’d check out the menu that was posted outside. One of the waiters came out to greet us and his friendly demeanor made us decide to try it out. I had the special - a duck confit. It was moist and flavorful and likely the best duck I’ve had. The service complemented the food and the atmosphere makes it a great date night spot. We will be back. I’ve got my eye on the scallops on the menu. Good wine menu as well as sangria.</text>

Came here with my wife and father-in-law in back in June and had a phenomenal experience. Frank (my father-in-law) is from out of town and a harsh food critic--and he LOVED it! Our waiter was awesome, I forgot his name, but he's a former Marine. I got the fried chicken, recommended by our waiter, and it was excellent. The outside summer evening dining ambience was perfect...we'll definitely be back.</Text>

<Review>Small intimate spot. Has a small bar and limited seating but definitely cozy. Great place to take a date or hangout with some friends. They play old vinyl records while you eat. The food is very good and priced just right. If you want to get away from the crazyness, this its the spot. Also a good spot to dine alone.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

When you hear stories about places with amazing food where everything is made from scratch, this is what they are talking about. They even made their own ketchup and mustard. There's no way you won't love this place.</review>

My first visit to Circa was pretty good, howeve I think you could have been better if my tomato soup was less salty and the grilled cheese was actually something interesting, unfortunately it was something of a flat note. The mud pie did make up for it and the service was exceptional and liked the Cozy atmosphere of the cafe</Review>

Came here for dinner to catch up with some friends and it was the perfect location. That night the restaurant was not busy so we lucked out with a cozy table/booth. The restaurant was dimly lit but not too dark that you can't see your food. And the service was nice. As this place uses local produce the menu changes.  At this visit, we ordered the pork belly appetizer, a fried chicken salad, a jidori chicken, and steak and potatoes. Each tasted delicious and were a very generous portion. The steak was cooked perfectly at a medium rare and the potatoes were flavorful and not dense. The pork belly by far was my favorite of the night. Tender, succulent, and two pieces in an app just wasn't enough for the table (we wanted more!). Plus the veggies that accompanied each platter was on point. Only con at this visit was the egg on the fried chicken salad. It was hard boiled, which is not my typical go to for cooking eggs but just didn't compliment the salad. Otherwise every dish including the chicken salad was an absolute delight. Will definitely be back.

Fyi - This place is wine and beer only.</Review>

This place is relaxing, comforting, and divine with decor, music, Service, and scrumptious creations from Mike Almos.  The staff is attentive, courteous, and noninvasive.  The farm-to-table freshness melts and melds with each heavenly bite with a rustic backdrop and an extensive Craft Beer and Wine list that will compliment any food or mood!  My wife and I enjoyed the $5 appetizers for Happy Hour (Daily from 5-6:30), Flat Iron Steak, and Oopa as the Daily Fish.  The Chocolate Mousse was a perfect desert to share!  Go and Enjoy a great casual evening with friends - Life is too short, return daily! Mike is even willing to share his secrets with cooking classes for you to enjoy at home and impress with!< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Had the pleasure of checking out circa tonight with a friend. Between both of us we were able to sample about 70% of the small plates, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts.

My take .....

Owner / Chef Mike Almos has created a warm neighborhood restaurant serving locally sourced comfort food to a blues / Jazz soundtrack courtesy the restaurant's vinyl collection.

The interior is warm and relaxed, keeping some of the Farmhouse's accoutrements, like the table and chairs while adding its own identity and touches, like the reclaimed wood bar.

Local Craft beer plays a big part in the restaurant, not only making up the majority of the beverage program, but also being incorporated as an ingredient into quite a few of the restaurant's menu items .

What we ate...

Young Greens ~ locally grown butter leaf lettuce, poblano cornbread, goat cheese,
green tomato dressing with 'wall-greens' basil.

Home-brew Braised Bratwurst ~ house-made hopped brat, pale ale pan jus, sauerkraut, grain mustard.
this is a must order app.

Sautéed Baja White Shrimp ~ Tomato, basil leaves, house-made farmer's cheese, Belgian blonde broth.

Succotash & Brussels Sprouts ~ Sweet corn, brussel leaves, green beans, vegetable broth, maple glazed pork belly.

*OK we all know pork belly rocks but the succotash in this dish stole the show. Every vegetable was perfectly cooked and could be tasted distinctly while still working in unison with the dish.

Slow Cooked Pork Shoulder ~ Achiote marinade, plantains, yams, organic dates, herbed pan jus.

Chicken & Dumplings ~ Mary's chicken, Belgian blonde ale, root vegis, gold potatoes,sweet peas, fresh sage.

*A deceptively simple seeming dish loaded with flavor.

Banana Split ~ Bananas Foster, fresh berries, agave nectar,
spiced date vanilla bean ice cream

Berries & Cream ~ Fresh berries, fig balsamic syrup, pistachio ice cream, white cake.

*Oh and they make all their own ice cream.

If your down in University Heights or the area I would highly recommend stopping by Circa for elevated comfort food, made with top quality ingredients, executed right.

Even after our little hedonistic plunge we left not feeling bloated or stuffed because even though it was a lot of food it was not laden with salt and fat. Instead the flavor came from the product and the execution.

Someone else earlier complained about blandness, I disagree I had no problem picking up flavor and depth of flavor at that.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

I have to say that we come here often, there are a lot of restaurants in the area, but Circa is the only one that has been consistant with excellent service, good food, wonderful atmosphere, great music, the perfect place to enjoy friends and family, to eat, drink, and be merry.<//Text>

They got rid of the squeak in the breaks! No other place in the area wanted to deal with the issue. They went out of the way to figure it out when I came in for a basic break pad replacement.  They even gave me a ride home, super friendly staff. Gotta be good to the car you have!< /text>

<text>This place is wonderful.  Had a check engine light come on.  Took the car to them to check it out.  Turned out it was the same problem that they repaired a couple of months ago.  They did the repair again under warranty.  I didn't even have to ask about warranty repair, they told me it was covered under warranty.  No hassles at all!!  They worked my repair into their busy schedule.  I had my car back in three days, including waiting for the necessary parts to be ordered and received.  This is  a great shop!!  They are professional, friendly, honest and they honor their warranty with out any hassle.   These guys are fantastic!!</text>< pics>

<text>I paid $90 for a quote that was $1100. Turns out I didn't need as much as they were charging. Luckily I went someplace else because my parts were $150, labor $150, $300 total. That's an $800 difference.< /text><gmapID>0x54d1558196f2656f:0x89e9d105e0a31248</gmapID><response>{'time': 1619122597449, 'text': 'Upon completing the brake inspection of your vehicle, we discovered that the rear brakes were metal on metal on the right rear. The rotor had been ground down severely on the inboard side and both calipers were dragging. Both rotors are below discard thickness and the right rear was heavily damaged. The brake calipers would not retract as designed. Our recommendation to repair the brakes correctly and provide a safe operating brake system was to replace the calipers, rotors and rear brake pads. In addition, the brake fluid corrosion level was high which is why a brake fluid exchange was recommended to you. Safe brakes are essential to protect the driver, their passengers and also other drivers on the road. It is hard to imagine you were able to replace calipers, rotors, pads and have the brake fluid flushed for $300 but we hope your vehicle has been safely repaired for your sake and for the sake of other drivers on the road.'}<//response><pictures>None< /pictures><rate>1<//rate>< Name>

I first dealt with Eureka B & A, when I was towed into their shop after my car broke down. I have subsequently had lots of work done. Usually very prompt; always courteous, helpful, friendly and with all questions answered completely. Even though I am a woman, I know how a car works--and should work. Having a shuttle to take me where I need to go while waiting is a definite help, although I live too far to get home. That is the only disadvantage. My last service was to replace dead motor on my heater; I was wearing a blanket over my legs for awhile and amazed a young mechanic when I told him that I remember when cars didn't have heaters. Good to have heat again on my feet. I like the people there and they give good service in a friendly manner.< /review>

<text>First, these are very nice people, and with generally good intentions. This said, their business model is all about taking profit in my estimation, not the best interest of the customer.

First, I arrived on a Monday morning having already diagnosed my issue as a failing torque converter. Still, they gave me no option but to pay a $146 assessment fee. After their diagnoses, they could not tell me what the issue was except to say that the fluid was overfilled and leaking. My bad, I added a quart to compensate for the fluid leak. They offered a $1,600 converter change price for a job that typically cost $800-$1,000. Additionally, they priced a converter at  $280, a part that typically costs $175 for my vehicle, and said it would take 3 days to ship from Salt Lake City. I checked the local Autozone which had the part in stock for $159. Or, they offered to change the fluid, pan gasket and filter for $446, a typically $150-$175 job. I took this option in hopes it would help me limp home.

So, I was in a spot, had to get a fix, and they knew it. So, I got bent over for being at a disadvantage being on the road and needing to get a fix. BUT, I got back on the road and just hope I can get back home. On the flip side, they were nice folks and getting screwed  has felt worse. I’d go elsewhere, unless you bring your own lubricant.

On the flip side, looks like they did a superb job changing my fluid and filter. 👍🏾</text>< Pictures>

The first thing you should know is these folks really mean business.  They have nearly mastered everything that encompasses customer service,  professionalism, and quality workmanship.

I called a few days ahead to schedule my van for a full brake inspection and a hefty repair ticket.

I dropped it off first thing in the morning and they immediately got to work as they knew I couldn't wait til Monday.

First if all I was thoroughly satisfied with, and confident in Logan's diagnoses over the phone and his exploratory line of questioning that led me to believe he really knew what he was talking about. I felt good that I had picked the rught shop to take care of my van in the time alotted and without being oversold unnecessary services.

A few hours after I dropped off my ride (And was given a ride back to my hotel by their courtesy shuttle!!) I was called back by Logan to discuss what all I needed to have done.

He helped me cherry pick the most important repairs to keep me safe, while staying in my budget. I don't have the luxury of paying with credit or waiting a few days longer for parts, so they went above and beyond to search high and low for a used or new, or compatible part I needed.  Going to far as to send guys to another town searching.

That really impressed me.

Another thing that really impressed me was the willingness of the owners, Steve and Lacee to get deeply involved and even get their hands dirty when necessary.

It shows they really do care about the customer and they put service above all else.

I walked all the way back to the shop when my phone died mid day and I knew there was still some discussing and deciding to be done. Lacee then dropped what she was doing to personally give me a ride back to my hotel,  where I was picked up again by them a few hours later to go retrieve my vehicle.

This is such a big deal to me. I was in an unfamiliar town, with no other mode of ttansport, and no credit card to use uber.

I could continue singing their praises for another 2000 words but the main point of it all is, these folks will treat you right. They will go out if their way to give you the best possible service. And they will do it all in an honest upfront way that really builds trust and confidence.

I hope you find this review, and I hope you at least give them a call before deciding on a shop. Give them a fair chance and they will likely blow you away.< /text><Name>Rick Berry<//Name><Gmap_id>0x54d1558196f2656f:0x89e9d105e0a31248</Gmap_id>< Resp>

How often do you find great service, professionalism, honesty and integrity at a car repair center?

Eureka Brake has a great team, Steve, Walker, Karma, Ryan and others.  They take excellent care of people and provide true value.  The staff are easy to work with and schedule appointments, are well trained and they do not take advantage of customers or pad the bill!  The shop is very clean and shows pride of ownership.

In our case, they checked out a potential oil leak in my car and didn't charge me for an inspection, where other shops would have.  My wife's BMW needed brakes before our move and they set us up immediately with an appointment and made sure the car was safe for the drive and move.  Eureka Brakes goes the extra mile!

I highly recommend them!</text>

These guys are awesome! They got me in the day after I called, and their service was very quick and efficient. Their customer service was awesome and I really appreciated that they didn't try to sell me anything. They were honest about the things that weren't really necessary. They could have played it off as extremely important to try and get a sale, but they didn't. I appreciate the honesty. They were also more than willing to take the time to explain things to me that I didn't know. I'll definitely be going to them again in the future.< /Text>

I should have read all the reviews before I took my car. They are way overpriced. They do not tell you they charge inspection fees. When they give you an overpriced quote and you are not interested, they hit you with an unexpected $85 inspection fee when you want to take it elsewhere. I’ve never been charged an inspection fee ever from any other auto shop in my entire life!  I took it to two other shops the day before and was told the same diagnosis by both after Free inspections and they would do the same job for similar prices. I told Eureka brake before I went it had already been inspected and diagnosed I just needed an estimate. I was charged for them to tell me something they knew I was already aware of.< /Text>

Excellent customer service from the front desk lady and the manager. Ive had several friends recommend them. I did think they were charging way to much to inspect the vehicle because of this I went else where. I dont mind paying 110+ a hour for labor if your working on the vehicle but inspections should be free.
JL automotive has a free inspection program but are booked out til 7th.</review>

Fantastic service as always! My car was overheating and I was able to get an appointment right away. They were very thorough, and when a part took overnight to arrive they had a loaner car I could use. I am always greeted by name . Been coming here since college,Now my kids bring their cars to be fixed as well!<//text>

I bring my car here whenever I need work done and  always get great service. They get it taken care of fast for reasonable prices, offer triple A discount and occasional coupons for discounts off labor. They communicate very well, provide daily updates  and explain the problem in language I can understand.</Text>

My Lincoln MKX check engine light came on and I drove to the only local vehicle service shop I trust.  I was quickly diagnosed and received word that the work wasn't urgent.  I made an appointment for the work the next week.  I've been to EB&A previously and was pleased with their work and professionalism.< /text>

Expensive, but that is because of the location. However, they took my car in with no appointment, fixed the problem in record time and the charge was less than what I was promised because the problem was not as bad as I thought. They saved me money and the man at the front counter was just amazingly friendly and helpful. They gave me a half price discount on my front brake inspection because I was there for back brake replacement. I even got a text from them the next day saying thank you! wow. So, over all, this place was scary in the beginning but it ended up being worth my drive from Orick California< /Text>

Have been a customer for over 6 years, it’s the only place around here that I fully trust with my vehicles. I’ve had them swap out an engine on my Honda Accord for the best deal around, and perform regular maintenance/services as well. Whenever I bring a vehicle in for maintenance, the feedback and quality of work is always top notch, that’s why I keep coming back. And the AAA discounts are nice too :)<//text>

I was in the middle of an interstate move when my car started making horrible noises, and Eureka Brake and Auto took my car and went to great lengths to have it done same day on a Friday - something they certainly didn’t have to do. Of course, when I headed out on my next leg of the journey and my tire blew out three miles in, I took the car back to them and they fixed that too. I know they were busy and they went above and beyond to get me on my way. Top notch customer service!<//text>

I made an appointment to have my inverter fluid and my antifreeze flushed out and replaced.  I was quoted $125 and said, “great, I also received a $25 off any coolant change coupon in the mail”.

When I arrived for my appointment I was told it is $122 for my inverter fluid and they would not take my coupon.  I told the employee I had scheduled for inverter fluid and an antifreeze flush and replacement.  Then I was told it’s a $350 service.  I walked out of here and won’t be coming back.

I wish I was told the correct price of ($350) before I planned my day around you servicing my car.  The price is too high, and I will go somewhere else.  You all have wasted my time!< /review>

From the reviews it looks like they over charge people. I just needed a 19 point inspection and they told me they will only do a full 52 point inspection for $106. I told them I will call around to see if I could find somebody to do the 19 point I need. I was responded with "good luck" and a quick hand up. Made some calls and sure enough I'm getting a 19 point inspection for $20. I really dislike making negative reviews. I work in retail and I'm  very aware of how customer service should go.</review>

To be honest, they were really nice and helpful, especially with the shuttle, but I seriously feel like they highway robbed me...charged me 275$ for changing spark plugs that I brought and it took nearly 4 hours (which I can understand if there’s a long wait, but the team member I spoke with said it shouldn’t be more than a couple hours.)< /review>

<text>These guys bend over backwards to make me a satisfied customer.  Warranty is double what I have found at other shops and pricing is competitive.  They know their stuff and they are very patient with explaining things and standing behind their work.  I have had them do some major repairs and some small maintanence repairs and they are quick, reliable, professional and communicate well every time even when I am frustrated and cranky towards them< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

they charge you up the nose, and can't seem to find problems other places can. ive been here multiple times, and been charged hundreds of dollars just to have them shrug their shoulders. ive gone to other places after and they were able to look at it AND fix it for much cheaper. also, this place spams you through text, call, mail, and email for months with no end in sight. ive had one good experience with them the first time i went there where one of the mechanics told me what was wrong and before i drove away, he ran through the rain to gift me an entire bottle of motor oil. always gotta give credit where credit's due.</text>

What a joke! My wife took her car in for an oil change and tire rotation around noon well 4 hours later and she was still there. Really 4 hours to change the oil and rotate the tires? Then when she went and told them that she needed to leave they got rude with her. Bunch of worthless mechanics, don't ever take your vehicle there unless you don't have anything planned for along time. Pathetic, they don't even deserve the one star I gave them.<//Review>

<Review>Complete joke, went in for a starter came out with my window completely stuck down and tried to quote me 1000$ for just the window motor (87$ part online) then charged me 100+ for a "window diagnoses". Absolutely obsurd. Cliff is a clown and a shady individual. The only people that get my respect there are logan and ken, they were super helpful trying to resolve the issues but overall this place does not even deserve one star.< /Review><UserId.>114311556650812070034< /UserId.><resp>{'time': 1506693345542, 'text': 'We are disappointed to hear that you found our work unsatisfactory.

Got an estimate for $800 to do the rear brakes on my 2012 Dodge Ram 1500. Took it to Les Schwab and got the job done for $500. Lost $75 on the estimate which Schwab would have done for free as well.</review>

I have been using this body shop for years because they do an excellent job. Paint and body work is on par with factory build. Wisam, the manager, is an excellent gentlemen who provides great customer service and professionalism. Definitely a place you want to repair your vehicle if you value your car and money. My bmw was rear ended and the photos I have included  will back up my statement.< /review>

<Gmap_id>0x80d958f46b23f06d:0x1a422db020ecfccf</Gmap_id><Text>This is my first BMW repair done outside the dealership, unfortunately after an accident I had (see pics), the estimates and list of parts I got from other places gave me worry about the cost. My cousin recommended Rodeo Auto Center, I took my car over and spoke with Sam, he gave me a short list of parts and even agreed to repair the hood and fender without requiring new parts, when everyone else insisted that they can't be fixed since they're Aluminum. Two weeks later I got my car back thinking I'd find a million problems but, Sam and his team have done such an amazing Job that I could only say thank you! Highly recommend if you're looking for quality at a great price. Thanks<//Text>< date>

This place is so great. They exceeded my expectations. My car was done in an hour and they saved me hundreds of dollars on a problem that kept recurring. They explained why it kept happening and what to do in the future to prevent it. The guys are life saver and are so nice ! I’m definitely coming back for my car repairs and maintenance. They have so much experience and are very honest about prices and their process, I am grateful thank you.</review>

Rodeo auto center  is a great spot to do business. I needed to get my bumper done and a buddy of mine recommended this spot.  I meet Sam, a really cool guy.  He asked what i wanted done and by when, besides painted i needed the bumper to be repaired do to it being  20+yrs old.   Just picked it up, looks absolutely amazing besides  just seeing new paint, also ahead of schedule and was better priced than i expected!  Always a plus.     I'm definitely bringing the whole car when done building it.<//Text>

<Text>I was really impressed with this place and how they took care of me. First I was greeted by Sam. He was nice and obviously in the middle of a lot of different projects but he was courteous and very friendly. I needed a bumper replaced and a few other things but instead of just charging me whatever he wanted for all these services l needed he was so open to showing me exactly how much everything cost.The work was outstanding the bumper was obviously well painted and matched perfectly and the car looked brand new again.Several of the other customers told me about how well they half been taken care of and that I had nothing to worry about. I have never experienced that before in an auto body shop. The bottom line is that Sam was true to his word his people did amazing work and they didn't take advantage of me, they did the work quickly and I couldn't have ask for more in this experience. I plan to go here for all my auto body needs from this point forward, and I will recommend anyone to come here.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Time>1600238487148<//Time>< rating>

<Review>I had a very good experience recently with Sam and his team. The job was done perfectly and stress free.
Sam has a good welcoming attitude towards his customers. He explains the process of what is to be done with the car until it gets painted again and gives warranty for his work.
I highly recommend this shop< /Review>< Time>

This place is AWESOME! It was recommended to me by a friend and when I went there they fixed my car on time and it looked fabulous. Customer service was great the owner ( Sam) was very friendly and their prices are reasonable not like the other places where they rip you off for small repairs.  I will not think twice about going there to fix my car :) Thank you Sam and thank you Rodeo Auto Center<//review>

I have been going to Rodeo Auto Center for about seven years. Sam has done auto body jobs on my multiple cars 5 times, from my BMW and pickup truck  to my children's Toyotas. He does a great job with reasonable  prices.  I would recommend him in heartbeat.</Text>

Called and Sam got me in the same day. My 2012 Toyota Corolla felt sluggish and the check engine light came on. Sam did a diagnostic test and found that the maf sensor needed to be replaced. Also got my brakes changed with new air and cabin filter for a really good price! Everything done within 2 hours! Call Sam and he will hook you up!<//Review>

I have a black Honda Accord and rodeo auto center took care of everything. It had front end damage and they fixed it and I sold the car the next day with no issues at all. Highly recommend if I can give it 10 stars I would but best service to exist.< /Text>

I have to say that I’ve had a great experience in this dealership. Mr Cesar showed great knowledge on the vehicles and knew exactly what I wanted when I described what I was looking for. He didn’t push me to buy just to make a quick commission. He listened and he didn’t rush me!!! Excellent service and I feel like I made a good choice on the vehicle I chose!!! Thank you Mr. Cesar!! I highly recommend this place!< /review>

<review>CAREFUL! I took my vehicle here because I had accident. We agreed on a price. WHAT?and my vehicles  was 100% intact and fine when I took it there. He didn’t change anything that was supposed to be changed, and he charged me for it. He made no effort to apologize for killing my battery or ruining my muffler. What a joke this place is, and I would keep my distance from this place. The owner ( Sam) takes no responsibility for his actions and did not even want to help fix the problems he created. I just took my vehicle and got out of there.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>It's not yhe right place to fix your vehicle at , but it's good to be wrecked. I've had very bad experience with that place because my cousin went to fix her car at that place and she took her car to somewhere else to fix a lot of problems that were net even there. Also bad attitude from the workers and the owner as well . she paid over $3000 on her car to be fixed and she spend almost the same amount at the other place to fix other problems that was add on the top of the major issues that she had previously. I don't recommend this place at all . if this place is the only mechanic in the whole world I'd rather to total my car instead fix it over there even though it has small issue.</Review></record>

If you are in “ San Diego / El Cajon “ area do NOT go to "Rodeo Auto Center” to fix your vehicle, lied about the parts being Moog. They were low quality, and only when I asked him to show me the parts did he claim not to understand the question, which he said "Yes" to three times. Bottom line they are bunch of thieves and playing the insurance system and I will make sure reporting them to the office authorities to pull his license to stoping him stealing people.<//Review>

<Review>Doesn’t even deserve a one star. He doesn’t even know how to do his job right. I took my car to him so he can changes things in it. He only changed things in the exterior but nothing in the interiors that was supposed to be changed. They made the process super hard and I wouldn’t recommend anyone to hand over their car to them because it will come back worse.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

I wanna thank the Rodeo auto center team for an amazing job on my car that required major collision repair. The prices are great and the quality of the work was even better! I would high recommend coming here for anything.</Review>

Amazing service at an affordable price! My mustang had a tremendous amount of side damage which other companies were quoting over 2K and two weeks to fix. Sam and his crew were about to BEAUTIFULLY repair and repaint the side for considerably less money and time. I also brought my mustang back again to have the convertible roof looked at. In ONE day, Sam and his crew were able to figure out why the roof wasn’t working, ordered the parts to fix it, and installed the parts making my mustang a convertible again! Once again, all done at a very affordable price. I highly recommend any auto issues be brought here!< /review>

Not even one star because of their experience that's one of my family had with them,  I do not recommend it at all, Unless you would like to have a bad experience, or waist money on problems that your cars might not even have, but just because they said so.<//Review>

I went to Rodeo Auto and I had the best experience possible. First everyone there was so kind and they treated me nicely with great respect. I had gotten into a minor accident and I took my car in for an estimate to fix my car. The owner helped me in choosing the best estimate to fix my car. They were able to fix my car within a week and my car looked as if I just bought it. They do a professional job with low price. I recommend everyone to go to Rodeo Auto because they are the best in town.
Thank you Rodeo Auto for fixing my car with the best price!<//review>

FIRST LET START OFF BY TELLING THE TWO REVIEWERS THAT WROTE BAD COMMENTS, I DON'T BLAME YOU. I HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN THE OLD OWNER WAS THERE AND HE WAS NOT GOOD.
BUT NOW THERE'S A NEW OWNER, THE PLACE IS CLEANER THAN IT USE TO BE . MORE ORGANIZED AND THEY FINISH THEIR JOB ON TIME OR EARLY, I HAVE FIXED TWO CARS THERE SO FAR. ONE WAS MY WIFE'S 2004 NISSAN MURANO, WHICH NEEDED NEW TIRES AND OIL CHANGE, THE MECHANIC SAID COME BACK IN 2 HRS. I CAME BACK 30 MIN EARLY N HE WAS FINISHING MY CAR. THE OWNER OFFERED ME SOMETHING TO DRINK.( WHICH IS VERY NICE).
AND NOW I JUST DROPPED OF MY 2010 CAMRY FOR A LITTLE PAINT JOB. N THE OWNER SEND ME A PIC OF THE JOB AND IT LOOKS AWESOME I CANT WAIT TO GO PICK IT UP.
ALL IN ALL I GIVE THESE GUYS A 5-STAR . THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE GIVE THEM A CHANCE . AND THEIR PRICES ARE GREAT COMPARING TO OTHERS IN EL-CAJON.<//Review>

HORRIBLE!!!! The only  Reason they're getting one star because I have to put 1 star to make a  Review. I had damage to the front bumper and hood and the back bumper he took off my back bumper and realigned it and did not  Paint it!!!! and tryed
to charge me $450.  The front of a car by the grill was painted they did not wait long enough for my paint to dry to put my license plate back on and now I have Indent in my paint job of my license plate!!!! I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone!!!!!< /Text>

I love this place. They always have parts at great prices. I recommend this shop for all of your appliances parts needs. I received free testing of my old parts and got my dryer working fine. Its 10 years old, but it works like new. Thanks National Appliance Parts.</Text>

I needed a part for my washer that was out of stock in the Mississippi and Tennessee area. I took it upon myself to look for it on line. National Appliance Parts had it in stock, and got them to ship it overnight. To verify the part and make sure it was the correct one I contacted them. I loved their customer care system. They are very knowledgeable, friendly and respectful.  Thanks guys for all your help.
Definitely recommend them.< /text>

Went in because my Kenmore dryer stopped heating. I looked at some videos online and so I took in my thermostat. They offered to test it and to my surprise the thermostat was good. they then recommended to test the heating element. So I came back with the heating element. They tested it and it was bad. They had it and it was bad. They had it in their store and my dryer was fixed. Thanks Again!!< /Review>

JC is the best. I couldNt figure out why my dryer wouldnt heat. I did everything  they said online. I replaced the dryer heater, fuses, and thermostat and still nothing. Jc told me to check the circuit breaker and he was right! All that work and I couldve just called him first.</Review>

I bought a ac capacitor from them then went home and hooked it up wrong. The condenser wouldnt turn on. I called them and over the phone they walked me through it and helped me hook it up correctly. I feel comfortable buying from a company that knows their field and doesnt just try to sell.</review>

I went in to buy a heating element for my Bosch dryer because it wouldn't heat up, after they tested my old unit, they explained that it wasn't the issue and there's no reason for me to spend the money on that.  They said it was a simple fix and explained in detail how to do it.  I was very impressed with the service. I appreciate the honesty and helpfulness.</Text>

<user>100999765674372880334</user><Text>Always a great experience for me and the family. My nephews are fascinated by the machines and all the people working in the factory. Just go during a weekday if you're bringing kids, otherwise the machines won't be running. Definitely recommend the wine and choco pairing! The cafe lacks anything unique to the Belly factory except for maybe the ice cream, but there are tons of food options in the area if you're looking for a nice lunch.<//Text>< gmap_id>

Always a fun experience with the family! Kids love it and so do adults. The workers always wave and have a smile on their face. Also try the wine pairing. I had the Late Harvest Dolcetto paired with one of their dark chocolates they recommend. Very delicious!< /review>

Went a while ago and it was super fun day trip. Decent little bit of learning how they made the candy and some games here and there to add to the fun. Would recommend for a good time.< /text>

I forgot how cool the Jelly Belly headquarters is. Everything Jelly Belly from the candy choices to all the non candy items. They also have a great clearance section for thrifters like me always looking for a deal.< /Review>

This is a great place to come and get Jelly Belly shaped food. Sweet or savory.  Their Jelly Belly shaped pizzas are the best around.  Super cheesy. And if you like prefer sweets they will obviously have something there for everyone.  Don't miss the factory tour.  I love the scent tubes the most. One of my favorites.<//Text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>This was a quick stop at the store to pick up a bag of Belly Flops, which are the imperfect production line rejects. A two pound bag will cost you about twelve dollars and there is usually a quantity discount (buy 3 get 2 free). I live in the same town and have taken the tour many times. They have started to charge a fee for the self guided tour Whenever I want a jelly bean, it has to be a Jelly Belly.<//text>< pics>

A really fabulous experience for all lovers of Jelly Belly!

There is a free tour here which is informative, but self guided.  There is a large shop for purchasing all of your favorite Jelly Belly’s and a tasting bar as well!

There is a cafe and outdoor area where you can sit down and enjoy a bite to eat.

The factory also has a shop which makes fudge and chocolate as well.

All the things you need for your resident sugar overload!!!<//Text>

Love going here. I always see and learn something new. Best time to go is during the week so the kids can see the factory in process. Very inexpensive.<//text>

<Review>Had a free tour of the factory and learned about the process of making jelly beans. They have a sample bar for you to try out the different flavors of jelly beans, but you’re limited to 3 flavors at a time. They have a large variety of flavors so make sure you try as many as possible. The tour itself was self-guided and lasted about 15-20 minutes depending on how long you want to stay at some sections. There are games throughout the tour for kids to play. At the end of the tour, we were given 2 packs of jelly beans to take home for free.<//Review>< pictures>

Great place too take the kids! Very informative on the Jelly Bean process, I had no idea the time and precision it took to make the candy. It was also very patriotic about the great US president and California governor
Ronald Regan. A classic All American Company.<//review>

< Review>
Me and my family have been to this Jelly Belly Factory several times over the years. This was the 1st time that it was not busy. They had a great sale going on. I miss their tours. The funnest one was during Christmas time. I understand them not doing it with COVID-19. I will continue going supporting them as much as possible.</Review>

Took the grandkids to the Jelly Belly factory as a surprise. Had a great time, did the fiery five challenge where you eat progressively hotter jelly beans from cayenne all the way to Carolina Reaper, I had to stop at habanero. You have to try the chocolate covered bacon and the fudge with bacon, surprisingly good. the artwork made out of jelly bellies is very cool! Can’t wait to go again!

Update: they also have paid guided tours actually in the factory, you get to wear a Jelly Belly uniform and be down on the factory floor.< /Text>

<time>1616831693121< /time><review>Hello Jelly Belly I am quite disappointed with my company's boozled bean product that I bought in a large 99g spinner box and the candy is of complete quality with full pellets and very good stock. However, the quality of the candy has a bad smell, the company should remake the 2 new scents of season 5, which are not real and difficult to taste and should give a higher proportion of scented candies. The pea is firm and firm, so the baby diaper smell and the grass smell back will be better thanks. bean boozled 5th no number one.</review></record>

Jellly Belly was very disappointing. No more samples. No more free tours.
$5 for adults $2 kids
It was boring before but now you have to pay to be board and get no candy unless feel like over paying for it.</Text>

Still had bulk, they would just bag it all individually.  We got two of their caramel apples and those are melt in your mouth delicious.< /review>< pictures>

We enjoyed our factory toot but lit bit disappointed, we called them if tour available but after reaching there they said no production today which mean tour is just waste of time the video clip you can watch on YouTube too..< /Review>

Just make sure to check over BOTH gift shops  (yes there are two. One by the entrance and the cheaper one by the cafe!) before making a purchase. If you want it they have it in Jelly Belly form!</Text><time>1494730862785<//time>< GmapID>

Jelly Belly is another tourist attraction that one should visit. It is roughly 1.5 hours drive from San Jose. This factory is so impressive as the production floor is so clean and organized. If you love sweet stuff, then you must visit this place as it is a family owned business for six generations. This is our second visits and every time our kids buy a lot of authentic Jelly beans with hundreds of different flavors.
We also love wine tasting for only $20 per person. I would recommend this place to everyone. The staffs are professional and friendly. You can also try samples for free.< /review>

This is a great family activity especially if you are looking for something fun and cheap. The tour is completely free and great for all ages. My three year old loved it and yet it was interesting for me to. On top of that they give you a free jelly belly hat and some free jelly bellies too. The have a tasting area where you can taste as many beans as you want. They limit you to three beans at a time but you can go through as many times as you want.<//Text>

Amazing experience to see some of my favorite candies being made.  Their tour is nice and informative including little games for children to play along the way.  The sample bar is incredible since I have never even know that they made more than jelly beans.  Staff was very friendly and the grounds were immaculately maintained.  There is even a game fire hydrant for four legged friends complete with a sign that states it's not a real hydrant.  There children loved it and so did I.< /Review>

Always Great deals! I didn't take the tour this time due to Covid 19 restrictions. They made a few changes to the layout to accommodate restrictions. You can only go in the front. The exit is the side by the cafe. Purchases are made in a one-way direction and spaced out for safety.  The fudge is not in view and you can no longer self-fill bags. Instead the bags are in 1/2 pound bags for $5 behind the counter. Due to spacing there's fewer purchase displays. Otherwise it was pretty much the same for me! I spent too much LOL</text>

<text>I went a few years ago and it was a good tour and experience but going again in 2018 the whole tour have been redone it was far more informative and Interactive. there are some play activities for kids along the tour they've opened up a whole new section showing off candy molds. It was an amazing experience.<//text>< date>

This is one tour I never get tired of. It's free, fun and family oriented. The Jelly Belly factory has the best flavors. The nasty flavors, like dog food and wet wipes, are great to play jokes on people. At the end of the tour, you get a free, small bag of jelly belly beans.<//review>

My niece wanted something to do...so I brought her here.

It's a fun place to go. They offer free tours of the factory every 30 minutes.

During the tour they have televisions that tell you about the process of making the jelly beans and of the history.  Its incredible the amount of Jellybeans that are made.

As consumers..we just buy off the shelf..but to see the process is pretty cool.

Along the way the have made portraits of different presidents and Elvis out of Jellybeans.

At the end of the tour they give you small sample bags of candy...

This is free.

As you walk in they have a sampling counter with many flavors to choose from.  You can choose 3 to try.

In the store they sell merchandise..
Chocolates...Jellybeans...soda ect.

At the back they have a deli that sells burgers...fries ect just in case you get hungry while being here.

Across from this deli they have a clearance store where the items are marked down significantly.

They offer bags of candy for 75% off the original price which is awesome.

If you have never been here before..
It's a pretty neat place to see.

Dont forget to buy the dog food...fart...booger...dirty sock jelly beans to prank someone...🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪<//review>

<review>This places deserves no less than five stars. Free tour and unlimited free Jelly Beans (3 at a time though). Just make sure you get here early or you will wait a long time for all the free stuff or worse, you can't find parking. They have a nice food court and candy shop as well. You can get five 2lbs of Belly Flops for $30. Bargain! Just don't eat too much candy or you'll get some nice cavities and maybe a dose of diabetes.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyd_4G_WjOZvjCZLzYrjdVjlgsVWYauDvgV7qX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8lgAHdfyQ5nvnoFIGH2YzTNtLsNIOkI7lSwgA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzdvQWmv_6ySxwjEXXCvCe2AVzLqKPkBkd5nso=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhsavb19vyaSWqJqv7tdtVYIRY_AxcLS3zPZcz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7cN_oIcMA0wlXupNQMqNReIfisHOdieUkwNH_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbJYvSUTAyrenjmFu8itj5xFCbyNai2x7t7kmC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUIGRr9PYhAicoSrgKKZ5pSWsTGmskLoGv6O2M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

< Review>
Awesome tour, probably the best in the USA.  It’s a self-guided tour with videos that explain the life of a jelly bean. While you’re walking around you can see the factory workers creating and packaging the beans. It’s all very exciting and there are free samples : )< /Review>

Fun experience!  We did the factory floor tour and it was good but we didn't get to see and experience as much as we had liked and our guide had limited knowledge but was very enthusiastic and friendly. We did the walking tour after and the videos brought it all together.</review>

<Time>1526771064713< /Time><rating>5<//rating><text>This place is a combination of Jelly Belly amusement park store and a self-guided tour of the factory. It should be quite fun for kids. Adults will probably not be particularly interested in the tour. You can walk through it in 10-20 minutes.

On the other hand, there's really nothing to complain about. The tour is free, and we received a free Jelly Belly sample bag at the end. The staff are also very kind.

For adults, there is a wine & chocolate tasting upstairs. In fact, it's the best $15 wine + chocolate tasting I've had. I'm not sure why there's a tasting room in the Jelly Belly Visitor Center, but I'm very glad it exists. Without it, our tour would've been rather dry.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOg8zMGMvNlwQajmxpm1p2gQHS_mRGqxw4iWpv-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCj6YQlxV3cXOal8ZwB0JDZXxy8KaQkfTjqeXh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSHpN5DxAoRT37Ide6kivAKoYELfu6TCy2zh4o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLhMSmtv0XNSfLnvt1oeDbT28yKvoSPs-74qjy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1526773800364, 'text': 'Nathan, thanks for your comments.

Fun experience!  We did the factory floor tour and it was good but we didn't get to see and experience as much as we had liked and our guide had limited knowledge but was very enthusiastic and friendly. We did the walking tour after and the videos brought it all together.< /Text>

Hands down the best place to bring your kids, they'll love it. Very convenient too, because afterwards, it can be the grown ups turn to have fun and drive around the corner to take a Budweiser Beer Tour. YAYEEEEE!!!< /review>

Was in town for a wedding & needed something to keep the kids busy.  This was quite an unexpected surprise.  Kids had a great time & so did the adults!  The free tour was quite informative, we had lots of fun learning about jelly beans.
Would highly recommend!</review>

<Time>1536178544435</Time><Text>Crowded!  Waiting in line for the free factory tour takes awhile.  We actually went upstairs to do a wine and chocolate tasting that also allowed us to skip the queue for the factory tour.  The wines were uninspired especially considering the proximity to Napa, but the chocolates were good (I did not realize Jelly Belly made chocolate.)  I am not a jelly bean fan but the tour was interesting.  Although next time I will pay for a guided tour and try to go when the factory is actually operating.  A bonus was we ran into the CEO of Jelly Belly during the tour!

Be prepared for limited parking on the weekends.

This is a fun and low cost thing to do.  And inexpensive but high quality chocolate can be found here!<//Text><user_name>Steven</user_name><GmapID>0x8085140b66039437:0x727fe552568827b2<//GmapID>< Rating>

Brought a guest from overseas here on our visit to Napa Valley. We loved the factory tour - it was informative and interesting. The free samples were great too. All in all we spent about 2 hours there. A really cheerful place :)< /Text>

There are games to play along the tour and lots of information to be had. I loved seeing all the art made out of jelly bellys! The candy shop has so so many options and almost everything tastes great! Do not try the "Bean Boozled" jelly beans... absolutely disgusting!! That is what they are designed for tho. Be aware.

Was in town for a wedding & needed something to keep the kids busy.  This was quite an unexpected surprise.  Kids had a great time & so did the adults!  The free tour was quite informative, we had lots of fun learning about jelly beans.
Would highly recommend!<//text>

< Review>
Crowded!  Waiting in line for the free factory tour takes awhile.  We actually went upstairs to do a wine and chocolate tasting that also allowed us to skip the queue for the factory tour.  The wines were uninspired especially considering the proximity to Napa, but the chocolates were good (I did not realize Jelly Belly made chocolate.)  I am not a jelly bean fan but the tour was interesting.  Although next time I will pay for a guided tour and try to go when the factory is actually operating.  A bonus was we ran into the CEO of Jelly Belly during the tour!

Be prepared for limited parking on the weekends.

This is a fun and low cost thing to do.  And inexpensive but high quality chocolate can be found here!</Review>

The Jelly Belly Factory is a very interesting place to take the family, and also YUMMY!  It's an open to the public free tour of the jelly bean factory. Who would have ever known exactly how many different flavors there is! And we even got to meet and take a picture with the Jelly Belly itself!</Review>

The Jelly Belly Artwork is wicked cool.  The hats you have to wear are silly but yet cool.   The best part is the end when you get to the store and buy the yummy treats.  The line moves quickly, so do be daunted by it.   We took family in from Spain there and they had a blast.  Hope you have as much fun as we did!! Enjoy:)< /text>< Pics>

Was in town for a wedding & needed something to keep the kids busy.  This was quite an unexpected surprise.  Kids had a great time & so did the adults!  The free tour was quite informative, we had lots of fun learning about jelly beans.
Would highly recommend!<//review>

<Review>Definitely go during the week while the workers are active and actually there so you can see how the assembly line works in the factory, actually making the beans!  Though you cannot take pictures during this tour, understandably so, because the workers would be uncomfortable, but it's such a cool experience regardless!< /Review>< pictures>

I enjoyed the whole Jelly Belly experience. From walking to the front of the factory and taking pictures at the giant Jelly Belly sign to walking around the store trying to decide which and how many Jelly Bellys I was going to get. I thought that the tour was very informative and I got to see pretty much everything. I now know when the company started and how many generations of the family work together on it now. In addition to this now I know how they make the mold for the jelly beans, which is quite brilliant and cost effective. The tour is self-guided, and everything was relatively easy to navigate. This is a great place for people of all ages. The tour is also wheel chair accessible. Wonderful place, wonderful people, wonderful candy.<//Review>

Sad how Covid 19 has affected this place. Use to be so full of patrons and merchandise. Even the employees looked depressed.<//review>

< Review>
A must see when you are in Fairfield, CALIFORNIA, stop by and treat yourself on a live factory field trip during operational hours M-F (9 am - 4 pm). At the end of the plant tour, each tour participant gets a bag of Jelly Belly candy sample. The candy showroom has an eye-catching display of colorful Jelly Bean candies, be sure to go to the sample station and find out your favorite flavors. You can purchase an unlimited amount of Candies in the Showroom. There is even a Portrait of President Ronald Reagan made of Jelly Bean candies, this was his favorite candy, just so you know. The candy factory runs their very own fast food restaurant in case you get hungry. If you are in town, stop by for the experience, and you will not be disappointed.<//Review>

Came here with my Meetup group. We were five adults, 3 children. We came knowing that production doesn't happen on weekends and that they have a self-paced video tour. I've been here before so I knew the general layout and everything but for the people visiting for the first time, it was easy for them to get to the gift shop and cafe. The prices for photos are still way too much money but I still love that they do them. I wish they'd offer a cheap digital only package. The Wine/Chocolate tasting was a nice addition from when I was last there. Three of the adults in our group participated and enjoyed themselves. They liked that it was pretty inexpensive. Overall we had a very good time. Highly recommend a trip here.< /Review>

We were very pleased with our visit to the Jelly Belly Candy Company! The tour was very interesting and free. The tour did an excellent job balancing fun activities for the kids such as smelling and guessing jelly Bean flavors while seeing the technical process that goes into making the candy. I was surprised to receive a free bag of Jelly Bellys at the end of the tour. The gift shop was large and had discounts on some items.</Review>

<review>This is a fun outing for family, friends and out of town visitors.  We had a wonderful time.  The tour was informative, educational and enjoyable.  The Jelly Belly Artwork is wicked cool.  The hats you have to wear are silly but yet cool.   The best part is the end when you get to the store and buy the yummy treats.  The line moves quickly, so do be daunted by it.   We took family in from Spain there and they had a blast.  Hope you have as much fun as we did!!

<rating>5< /rating><review>My friend and I wanted to do a couple things as a break to eating and drinking wine. We went first thing on a Sunday morning which was perfect because we avoided all the crowds. Unfortunately, the production floor was not in operation so we didn't get the full effect but still think it was worth it. We learned a lot, enjoyed the atmosphere, and were able to buy some goodies to bring home!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Time>

Great place to take the family for a free tour of the Jelly Belly Factory. They offer free samples of all their available flavors and a store to buy as many different varieties of Jelly Beans. They also offer a wine tasting option for those who just can't get away from some wine and a good time.</review>

I have good memories of being there as a child and have had the pleasure of taking my students on several field trips here. Staff is friendly, helpful, and patient with large groups of kids. We always feel accommodated. The fact that entry is FREE is like the cherry on top!< /text>

<review>This is our family's favorite place to visit! We took the tour the first few times but now we just load up on our favorite jelly bellies and sometimes have lunch in the cute dining area! Jelly belly shaped pizza is a hit with the kids! Also they have a jelly belly tasting bar where you can try out the flavors!<//review>< Name>

<text>Check website for days factory is closed, or production is stopped. Tour runs daily from 8am to 4pm, every 10 to 15 minutes. Lots of free parking, enter main building to line up for the group tour. Groups enter to first watch a video, then tour plant on your own. Lots to learn, and see. Viewing windows for adults and kids. You can observe all aspects of jelly belly production. After tour there's a store, and food court. A must for kids. Free samples!<//text>< Pictures>

Visit to this place is a good experience .They have kept their legacy alive and in full swing. They conduct free self guided tours in every 15- 20 minutes. If you want to experience the process , watch the videos at every stop. They staff is good and cooperative. They have a cafeteria and gift store .<//review>

Wonderful experience! Great for adults as well as children regardless of age. Lots of candy (obviously!) And a lot of fairly simple explanations of the process of manufacturing each jelly belly bean. Would highly recommend for highly inquisitive kids as well as adults.< /Text>

Probably would rate this higher if they had better, shaded RV parking and didn't have a DB rent-a-cop working their parking lot security. Wouldn't even let us park in the shade to let our dog out to potty in the dog potty area or in the shade for our dog, trying to tell us Rvs are insulated and so won't get too hot for our long haired dog. Obviously he has never been in an RV, they turn into ovens. So entire visit we were worried and stressed about our dog over-heating. So if you are in an RV with a dog and travelling through, don't stop here.< /Text>

<Review>How you anyone NOT like this place! It's amazing. When we pop those Jelly Belly candy we never think twice about how their made. But once you take the free tour, you gain a deeper appreciation on all the effort it takes to make em.

This is one of those place that you definitely have to put on your bucket list. Fun environment and their cafeteria (I didn't eat here though) had some pretty cool pizza shaped like a Jelly Belly.

Their Jelly Belly store can be pretty dangerous.. it's very enticing and makes you want to buy everything. Being a factory store, it seems they had lot of unique flavors I didn't see in the supermarket.

It's also amazing they introduces some new bold flavors and quite frankly, it's not for me or the faint of heart. But the kids love them.. why anyone would want to eat Jelly Belly flavors like "rotten egg" or " dead fish" or "vomit" is beyond my small brain.<//Review><rating>5<//rating><Name>Eric Tam<//Name>< user>

We had a great time here.  The tours are better than ever.  Glad they've redone them so they are self guided.  Take your time to see what you want at your own pace.  Also, if you are looking for some sugar free candies, they have gummy bears, jelly beans and sour jelly beans sweetened with Splenda.  They are pretty comparable to their sugared cousins.  Yummy!</text>

<Text>Loved this tour on a previous visit. But DO NOT come here on a Sunday. We drove over one hour out of our way to visit and there was NOTHING to see. Everything was covered up and it was extremely disappointing, especially considering half of our family has previously been there and knew what the rest of us were missing. We would have came on another day if we would have known. This visitor center should be closed too.< /Text>< Rate>

My friend and I wanted to do a couple things as a break to eating and drinking wine. We went first thing on a Sunday morning which was perfect because we avoided all the crowds. Unfortunately, the production floor was not in operation so we didn't get the full effect but still think it was worth it. We learned a lot, enjoyed the atmosphere, and were able to buy some goodies to bring home!< /Review>

<Review>Great place to take the family for a free tour of the Jelly Belly Factory. They offer free samples of all their available flavors and a store to buy as many different varieties of Jelly Beans. They also offer a wine tasting option for those who just can't get away from some wine and a good time.</Review>< GmapID>

<review>Check website for days factory is closed, or production is stopped. Tour runs daily from 8am to 4pm, every 10 to 15 minutes. Lots of free parking, enter main building to line up for the group tour. Groups enter to first watch a video, then tour plant on your own. Lots to learn, and see. Viewing windows for adults and kids. You can observe all aspects of jelly belly production. After tour there's a store, and food court. A must for kids. Free samples!< /review>< time>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>How you anyone NOT like this place! It's amazing. When we pop those Jelly Belly candy we never think twice about how their made. But once you take the free tour, you gain a deeper appreciation on all the effort it takes to make em.

This is one of those place that you definitely have to put on your bucket list. Fun environment and their cafeteria (I didn't eat here though) had some pretty cool pizza shaped like a Jelly Belly.

Their Jelly Belly store can be pretty dangerous.. it's very enticing and makes you want to buy everything. Being a factory store, it seems they had lot of unique flavors I didn't see in the supermarket.

It's also amazing they introduces some new bold flavors and quite frankly, it's not for me or the faint of heart. But the kids love them.. why anyone would want to eat Jelly Belly flavors like "rotten egg" or " dead fish" or "vomit" is beyond my small brain.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<text>We had a great time here.  The tours are better than ever.  Glad they've redone them so they are self guided.  Take your time to see what you want at your own pace.  Also, if you are looking for some sugar free candies, they have gummy bears, jelly beans and sour jelly beans sweetened with Splenda.  They are pretty comparable to their sugared cousins.  Yummy!< /text>< pics>

Small gifts (candy boxes) and a lot to see and smell for the children. Free samples (generous with candies, a little less with fudge) at the store you wouldn’t miss. Good food (we choose pizzas) at the cafeteria, except you have to wait too long after ordering.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1534740756931, 'text': 'Patrick, thanks for taking the time to rate and comment on our tour and Visitor Center.

<Text>Stumbled upon this during a SF/Napa trip and it was more fun than I anticipated. Well worth the stop if you are in the area. I'm not a fan of jelly beans, but if you are they have a place to taste all the various flavors. The factory tour/walk is fun as I enjoy geeky things like that.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Great place to stop for the kids! Nice free tour (usually every 15 minutes) that you can self pace once they get you started, and gives you a glimpse into the processing work of making Jelly Bellies! The store has so many flavors to choose from... plus, don't forget the belly flops! Good for an afternoon visit if you're in the area. Plenty of parking, even for RVs.</Text></record>

We took our kids/teens here on a Sat and we were very disappointed that the production line wasn't going. I would've been ok had we been informed that no protection was taking place as we lined up for a tour to see nothing. - I've been there on a production day and the self guided tours are a lot of fun when people are actually working. I've been there for their wine and chocolate tasting and that was a lot of fun too... - On our most recent visit we let my teens get whatever they wanted to get and they each got a bag full to the brim with jelly beans. As we approached a very irritable cashier named Gail we tried to get her to smile which should really be the other way around. I jokingly said I should've never let my kids run loose in a candy shop and by kids I mean these almost adult kids pointing to the teens, I laughed and said they probably are going to cost me an arm and leg in here, I know I'm not the funniest, but I was clearly trying to be nice and get her to be nicer herself, it didn't work, she stayed grumpy for whatever reason, and got super irritable when I added 2 items on at the end because taking more of my money usually isn't an issue at any other place.- At least we had jelly bellys to eat through the whole trip and then some!< /review>

The kids loved it and the store has fresh fudge and a HUGE selection of candy. There is a cafe on site too.

<review>Awesome place to visit with family! We did the complimentary tour which took about half an hour. Our granddaughter was mesmerized with  the process of making candies. They take picture in the beginning for you to purchase in the end. You also get free gifts( small candy boxes ). If you follow them on Facebook, you get more goodies. Check their gift shop. It was a great experience for our family.<//review>< Pics>

The factory tour is free, self guided and self paced with short videos to watch along the way. Friendly staff, $10 per pound of choose your own bulk bag of jelly beans. Make sure to check the overstock store next to the cafe. Lots of gift idea, well worth the stop.<//Text>

<Review>We have traveled all over the world and I have seen this sweet candy in a lot of places that I have visited!  Like having a little bit of treat from home.  Everything that you might wish you had for your sweet tooth is inside of this store.  There is a small cafe and wonderful exhibits of famous people.  The tour is very informative but the treats at the end is better.< /Review>< user_id>

< Review>
Very nice visit. A lot to see. Even on a Sunday, you can see the whole work chain factory, except there are no workers and machines running (we may come another time on a weekday). Small gifts (candy boxes) and a lot to see and smell for the children. Free samples (generous with candies, a little less with fudge) at the store you wouldn’t miss. Good food (we choose pizzas) at the cafeteria, except you have to wait too long after ordering.</Review>

<pics>None<//pics><Text>We took our kids/teens here on a Sat and we were very disappointed that the production line wasn't going. I would've been ok had we been informed that no protection was taking place as we lined up for a tour to see nothing. - I've been there on a production day and the self guided tours are a lot of fun when people are actually working. I've been there for their wine and chocolate tasting and that was a lot of fun too... - On our most recent visit we let my teens get whatever they wanted to get and they each got a bag full to the brim with jelly beans. As we approached a very irritable cashier named Gail we tried to get her to smile which should really be the other way around. I jokingly said I should've never let my kids run loose in a candy shop and by kids I mean these almost adult kids pointing to the teens, I laughed and said they probably are going to cost me an arm and leg in here, I know I'm not the funniest, but I was clearly trying to be nice and get her to be nicer herself, it didn't work, she stayed grumpy for whatever reason, and got super irritable when I added 2 items on at the end because taking more of my money usually isn't an issue at any other place.- At least we had jelly bellys to eat through the whole trip and then some!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Great place to visit! The tour is free plus you get free samples and free bag of Jelly Bellies at the end. If you're thinking to buy stuff (and there's plenty to want to get!), be sure to check out the case shop by the cafeteria in addition to the main store - crazy discounts! Also, in the main store, you can try every possible flavor and some super yummy fudge too! The whole thing is wonderful with kids or without! Highly recommend!!< /Text>

<review>Awesome tour.  First of all it is a FREE tour of the facility on how it all started and shows the process of creating the Jelly Bellies from beginning to end.  If you are in the area, I would recommend giving this tour a try.

Tour last about 45 minutes and they provide free Jelly Bellies.  They have a sample bar where you can try most of their flavors.  They even provide recipes on combining multiple Jelly Bellies to create one flavor.  For example, 2 Blueberry Jelly Bellies and 1 Butter Jelly Belly creates Blueberry Muffin flavor.  I gave this a try and it does taste like Blueberry Muffin.<//review>< pictures>

This place was amazing! Especially for a person like me who loves jelly beans! We took a private tour and we got these white lab coats and hairnets. Our tour guide filled our pockets with jelly beans fresh from production. I highly recommend the private tour especially for Jelly Bean enthusiasts.</text>

I love coming here! We stop by whenever driving between the Bay Area and Sacramento. Free tour, samples, tons of sugary goodies, and discounts for some of the goodies. Wish the food area had better selections, but we don't go there for that! :)</review>

Jell belly sounds like an awesome and unique place to visit. I find it very amusing how the factory workers make cool ideas out of the jelly beans, for example, the make detailed portraits and sculptures and they're all made out of jelly bean! They only disappointment is the originals jelly belly factory is located all the way in California, and not everybody can afford to take a trip to California to visit the factory.<//review>

<review>This place was really fun. There were hundreds of kids and adults inside. Plenty of room for more. This company knows how to handle crowds. The registers for check out were fast. It is almost overwhelming the amount of Jelly bean flavors. And they make chocolates and fudge.
I did not go upstairs or on the tour, next time.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Great for adults and kids... yes, this place offers you the setting of a candy playground.
With free admission, it lends itself to giving you a pictorial aspect coupled with audio visual aids making the history of jelly beans come to life. Tour is self pace and offers a variety of sceney across the production floor.
Upon completion - Browse the gift shop and take advantage of the free samples. Overall, great staff to assist when needed.< /Review>

What a great little detour to take the kids on to break up a long road trip!

Free tour, where you get a pack of free Jelly Bellies at the end. Cool jelly bean artwork. You can get a great deal on deformed Jelly Bellies called "Belly Flops." My kids loved getting those.< /text>

<Review>This is a candy lover's dream. Specifically, Jelly Belly enthusiasts. It is an awesome place to visit. The factory tour is informative, entertaining and informative. But the best part is the shop. We left with bags of jelly belly flops.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>The tour was surprisingly interesting; However,  The candy is about 40% cheaper if you buy it on Amazon (2lb bag $9.98on Amazon $16.95 at the factory). We were extremely disappointed and ended up not buying any candy at all.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<user>106226941420364887072<//user><Review>FREE Jelly beans!  FREE tour!! Free is good. I'm a fan. :)

Tours happen about every 15 minutes and the tour lasted about 45 minutes.  The tour was a cool experience - things typically aren't running during the weekends, so if you want to see the factory in action I recommend coming during the week.

I liked learning about Jelly Belly, but I wish that the tour relied less on video monitors and more on someone just talking us through the factory.  It definitely works from a scalability perspective so it makes tours efficient, but it was a little less special as a result.

However, that aside, I highly recommend that you visit!!</Review><Date>1385617587815< /Date>< name>

The shop is amazing, with all kinds of Jelly Belly products.  Didn't have a chance to try their restaurant food, etc.

Always a fun visit and continues to get better every time I go. This time there were new videos on candy making and the tour gift was a box of Bamboozes and an Assorted. I always buy some fudge also.</Text>

<Review>We really enjoyed our time here! The food in the cafe is Jelly Bean shaped, the employees were helpful, the tour is very interesting, and the Jelly Bean machines for a quarter we a hit! :) We had a one and two year old with us and it enhanced the fun! One downside was that they were out of Jelly Belly soda and all there frozen treats! Was looking forward to even more Jelly Belly goodness. An employee told us that they had been out for a while and she didn't know why. Definitely take the trip to the factory though and pick up some Belly Flops!<//Review>< Pictures>

We live nearly an hour from the factory. Called the phone line to confirm hours of operation and were informed the tours were open until 4pm on this day (Sat Dec 1). Arrived at 2:30pm to learn that they actually closed at 3 and stopped the tours at 2! Wow what a waste of time.< /review>

Each year on the first Saturday of December, for nearly the past 2 decades, Jelly Belly has hosted inside the Visitor Center our annual Christmas party for the employees and their guests.   Unfortunately, we have to close early that day to prepare upstairs and downstairs for hundreds of employees and their guests.\n\nWe have this information written on our website and on our online calendar, as well as our 800 line (800-953-5592).   When dialing the number, after the first couple of sentences, you are prompted to hit the number 5 which then gives you any special holiday hours and/or special events, beginning with Thanksgiving and up until New Year's Day.   In the middle of the holiday hours and/or special events recording you will hear about the special hours related to December 1, which is the first Saturday of December.   We are sorry you missed that information on our phone line and hope you and your family will consider visiting us again."}< /Response><Gmap_id>0x8085140b66039437:0x727fe552568827b2< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I live in the town of Jelly Belly Central. I grew up going through the original tours and whenever someone comes to visit weather family or friends where exchange students from all the way across the world I always take them to go see Jelly Belly. It is a fascinating tour to see the process as well as the history behind it. I think my personal favorites are the letters from President Reagan as well as the many different portraits that have been made using exclusively the different colored Jelly Belly jelly beans. I highly recommend visiting the Jelly Belly Center if he end up in the Fairfield California area.< /Text>< Pics>

The tour was surprisingly interesting; However,  The candy is about 40% cheaper if you buy it on Amazon (2lb bag $9.98on Amazon $16.95 at the factory). We were extremely disappointed and ended up not buying any candy at all.</text>

Fun for a lazy afternoon.  It's off my bucket list. Probably won't be going back anytime soon. It is worth going once and its free so can't get that picky. Food is not on the cheap side but the candy is worth buying.< /Text>

We hope you will return again to check out any current deals.'}<//Response><text>Was excellent. Enjoyed the tour and the cherry koolaid smell. I believe it's from their glass cleaner but may be the flavoring of the jelly bellies.

Sadly didn't get alot due to the price. Which is why I removed a star.
Factory should be cheaper than shops/stores.< /text>< Date>

<Response>None</Response><Review>JULY VISITORS READ THIS! I remember going on a tour as a teen and finding it actually pretty fun. I enjoy seeing how things are made... especially candy 😉. The website doesn't doesn't mention that July is the slow season so they take this time to test, repair, and replace machines. It is still fun to see, they have videos that walk you through the tour and show you what the machines do, but only a few are actually running during this time. Don't let my review stop you from going, just be aware that the factory is not at full steam. Other times of the year I would give 5 stars, I just wish the website mentioned it so I was prepared.</Review><Date>1501200424311</Date>< GmapID>

Call ahead to be sure they are not doing maintenance when you visit. I wish they had mentioned it when I called to ask if they were still open for tours. Apparently they still do tours when the factory is not running, but there is not much to see.

Many of the games and activities are closed now due to COVID-19 or out of order.<//text>< pics>

Childhood dream of visiting this candy factory fulfilled.  It's a self-guided tour so you can move at your own pace and watch tiny jelly beans form from start to finish.

Once finished, their candy store awaits, plying the senses with a multitude of sights, smells and flavors to wander through.

If you've ever wondered what Buttered Popcorn flavored Fudge was like, this is the place to find out (PS: It's awesome).

I would recommend everyone, the young and old, all come and wander through. Learn a thing or two, then spike your bloodsugar for the next month with a visit to the Jelly Belly Factory.</text>

My kids went crazy in here! Pretty cool spot! Oh, and if you are going to buy from the gift shop go to the discounted spot first (it's in the back by where the food place is). They have some of the same stuff that's in the store, but discounted!<//Text>

Free tour, AWESOME!!!  Buy a bag of belly flops for hours of entertainment.  We ate those along our road trip trying to guess what the flavors were.  Food at cafe was fun....not the best, but fun.</Review>

< Review>
The tour and candy was great .. the bad part is 9 cars got broke into broad day light while we were there. The manager never came out to check on any of us...the bad part this was not first time.it had been happening for two weeks no signs to warn customers and no security. as we were leaving we finally saw security. we where told that all cameras and systems went down same time. so be careful if you go leave someone at your car. sadly we had to come up with 250 to fix a window which cut things short .<//Review>

<review>This was one of the coolest factories I got tour they have a wonderful Cafe that you can grab a bite to eat afterwards or if you're in the mood for ice cream they have that too it does tend to be a bit crowded on the freeways around 11 or noon so if you're needing to get to say the airport allow yourself extra time<//review></record></dataset><record>

The Jelly Belly is a family affair where we load up all the grandchildren and make our yearly trek for boxes of Jelly Bellys and other memorabilia. This week we go with six grandchildren ranging in ages from 3-18, and I know without a doubt that every one of us will have a great time. The "train ride" is interesting as well as informative and fun, and the gift shop is amazing for all ages so be sure to plan out some extra time for browsing. We have been making memories with Jelly Belly for years and absolutely love love the place. You can't go wrong bringing your family to the Jelly Belly Candy Company.< /Text>

<review>the factory is a fun place to visit. the best part is that it is a free admission and hasfree parking. You get to see different parts of the factory by waking on these sky bridges and looking down towards the factory workers. At the end of the tour you get a free sample.< /review>< Pictures>

Fun interactive, self guided tours. Great parking for RVs, travel trailers and large vehicles. The staff was knowledge filled and patient with large groups, kids included.

We visited the Fairfield store when visiting for little sisters college Masters degree  graduation.  The people who worked there were so nice and professional.  The tour was awesome. I've always loved jellybeans. Now I only buy from jelly belly. The tour was informative.  They are super clean. The portrait made from beans were crazy awesome. The stories are fascinating.  It is so much fun. The store is great. Wish we lived closer then Tx. LOL ?Oh ya...... yes I would recommend others to purchase this product.< /review>

The Jelly Belly is a family affair where we load up all the grandchildren and make our yearly trek for boxes of Jelly Bellys and other memorabilia. This week we go with six grandchildren ranging in ages from 3-18, and I know without a doubt that every one of us will have a great time. The "train ride" is interesting as well as informative and fun, and the gift shop is amazing for all ages so be sure to plan out some extra time for browsing. We have been making memories with Jelly Belly for years and absolutely love love the place. You can't go wrong bringing your family to the Jelly Belly Candy Company.</text>

The tour and candy was great .. the bad part is 9 cars got broke into broad day light while we were there. The manager never came out to check on any of us...the bad part this was not first time.it had been happening for two weeks no signs to warn customers and no security. as we were leaving we finally saw security. we where told that all cameras and systems went down same time. so be careful if you go leave someone at your car. sadly we had to come up with 250 to fix a window which cut things short .<//review>

<review>I can't believe this is free. For no cost, you can take a self-guided tour of the factory. You walk on bridges overlooking the factory, as the TVs tell you about the history of Jelly Bellys, the process of making them, etc. You can also sample any of the hundreds of flavors. As you go through the line, you can only ask for 3 flavors, just for the sake of quickly getting through the line, but you can go through the line as many times as you want. You also get a free paper hat. Of course, there's also a store that sells everything they make.< /review>< Pics>

<review>The tours are free any you get a sample jellybeans at the end but at the beginning of the tour you have an opinion to take a picture but they won't let you take a picture with your own camera they have to take the picture so you buy it printed out.

Go during the week! Went on a Sunday and we were only able to watch videos of what they do at each stop. Still fun though and I highly recommend it! No photo or video is allowed on the tour, but is allowed before and after.<//Review>

We visited the Fairfield store when visiting for little sisters college Masters degree  graduation.  The people who worked there were so nice and professional.  The tour was awesome. I've always loved jellybeans. Now I only buy from jelly belly. The tour was informative.  They are super clean. The portrait made from beans were crazy awesome. The stories are fascinating.  It is so much fun. The store is great. Wish we lived closer then Tx. LOL ?Oh ya...... yes I would recommend others to purchase this product.</Review>

It was a treat visiting this place. Our kids loved all the cool things to check out but mostly eating Jelly Belly Jelly Beans. They try to sell you some pictures taken during the tour and the price is insanely expensive. Stay away from those.<//Review>

<Review>Visited the Jelly Belly factory on a Saturday, even though the production line was shut down, workers were busy behind the scenes replacing light bulbs, sweeping the floors and doing overall general maintenance. A very busy place in that respect. The self guided tour took about 45 minutes at a fairly slow pace. Awesome facility walkthrough. Family owned for several generations. Plenty of photo opportunities. Free sampling of the beans. Highly recommend this place. Would return.</Review>< pictures>

Free tour. It is a short walk through the factory with videos explaining the Jelly Belly process and history. Free jellies at the end. Finally, there is a good candy store with really good fudge.< /Review>

After spending the last 38 years eating Jelly Bellies It was great getting to check out where they were made.  I was disappointed with how run down the inside of the building was.  There were a number of overhead lights that were burned out in addition to some of the main neon lights.< /text>

<text>We arrived at noon, and ate lunch in the cafe.  The food was typical of a snack bar.  Waiting in line wasn't nearly as bad as it seemed it would be for the tour.  The tour was great.  Self paced, videos playing giving in-depth details of what you're seeing below you. A couple of interactive games along the way as well.  The gift shop was the worst experience, way to many people, shoved into a small area cluttered with merchandise.</text>< Gmap_id>

Went to do the free samples. They had sugar free chocolate but wouldnt let my husband sample one. So he had to sit and watch us sample and he couldn't. They didn't care asked to speak to manager all I got is she's going to be awhile due to she is busy. Very disappointing definitley will not be going there again.<//review>

We are sorry to hear that you did not have a great experience and will not return to our Jelly Belly tour and Visitor Center.\n\nThe following is a clarification for Google review readers.   The Jelly Belly Visitor Center has four sampling areas.   (1)  At the end of the free tour, guests receive a box and/or bag of candy.   If a guest wishes to exchange that for sugar free, they can take it to the Info Booth counter and exchange the tour sample box and/or bag for sugar free Jelly Belly beans.  (2)  We have a full Sample Bar that includes over 80 flavors of Jelly Belly beans, dozens of confections, and sugar free.   (3)  Our Chocolate Shoppe makes fantastic fudge and guests can sample fudge at the fudge counter.    Sometimes we have over 20 different fudge flavors, however we do not make sugar free fudge.  (4)  At the Chocolate Shoppe, we have a sample of the day.   These samples are specially made sample size chocolate items.

Tour is interesting, but don't expect to be blown away. Lots of walking and loud at times. Store is a bit overpriced. A worthwhile stop, though you won't want to see another jellybean for a week afterwards!< /text>

Love that they do tours here! It was really cool to walk through and see the whole process of making a jelly belly and learn some of the history of jelly belly as well. I wish more companies would do this.
The whole walk through area for the tour just looks dated.  Old dirty worn out carpet, and TV's and speakers that are old and often times not working. Not to mention it's loud as you walk through. So loud that it's hard to ask the tour guide questions while walking through.

Neat to see the process and I think it's worth doing once, but could definitely use an update.</Review>

< Review>
I was very disappointed in the tour. It was very boring and all we got was one jelly bean before and after the tour. What saved this place was its gift shop. Gift shop is amazing and that itself is worth returning to and just skip the tour.< /Review>

I enjoyed the tour and samples, but I would have liked to have known that I was not going to get to see the jelly part being made. Not sure if it was the time of day or the part that was under restorations, but jelly centers were not made on the tour I took Wednesday 11ish. Also they might want to upgrade video presentation. The videos look like and skip like vhs shot in 1990. Jelly belly jelly beans are good and don't forget area coupons in local wine guides.< /Review>

<text>The factory is great and I only have one a one-word complaint: Licorice.

I don't know why why they've clung to this godawful flavor for so long.

Every time I find a black licorice jelly belly I want to kick a baby.< /text>< pics>

<review>Its hard to grasp how big of a cultural icon Jelly Belly is without a visit to the factory in Fairfield, CA. The company has an amazing story, and operation, and if that's not enough, it's a free tour with free samples.< /review>< response>

< review>
This is a fantastic tour.  It's free.  Less than free, actually, as they give you a bag of jelly beans on the way out.  What you get for your less than free admission price is a really fun tour of the Jelly Belly factory.

The worst part of the tour is they way it starts with them taking a picture of your and your companions in front of a green screen that they later populate with images of jelly beans.  At the end of the tour you can purchase this for an absurdly high price or not bother.  They don't put any pressure on you, which is nice.

Then you get into the elevated walkway around the factory.  This is where the really cool part starts.  They show you the packaging and shipping lines, and if you like watching bag-filling machines and conveyor belts and Fanuc robots lifting boxes and trays of jelly bean trays -- and I do! -- this is totally fascinating.  As you walk around they show you other parts of the process, e.g. where the raw materials are stored, how the candy centers are made, how the outer layers are added, how the Jelly Belly logo is printed on, how they weed out the beans that are too large or small.

There is also a video segment on Ronald Reagan's love of Jelly Bellies.  And, there is an art gallery full of Jelly Belly mosaics.  Reagan fans will love this part of the tour.

Along the way they give you a small number of beans to sample.  And, our tour guide was legitimately funny.

At the end of the tour they dump you in a huge store full of their products.  The deformed beans -- Belly Flops -- are sold at great prices.  The other prices approximate what you'd pay in a Safeway.

This is a kid friendly tour that adults will like as well.  If you can, be sure to go on a weekday so you can see the plant in operation.< /review>

<Text>I'm insulted they tried to charge me $30 for 3 pics and a paper frame that they were gonna throw away any way. They didn't even ask if we wanted our pic taken. It ended up being a follow the leader kind of occurrence. Very much insulted. Also most of the activities along the self guided tour weren't even set up.< /Text><rating>4< /rating></record>

Candy lover or not, it's always amazing to see a success story. We went for the tour but being on the weekend all plant operations are shut down. It's almost like an amusement park here. Jelly beans has made quite a mark.<//text>

If you are at all whimsical, especially regarding jelly beans, you have to take a stop here and take the tour.
Give yourself at least 1 hour. They allow 60 people through at a time and, although it is a "self-guided" tour, you may find yourself watching all the videos on large screen TVs placed about every 50'-100' feet, explaining what is going on below. There are also some very nice employees at each of those to answer additional questions.
I was lucky enough to be near two employees, one new and the other explaining more detail and data about the goings on below. Really fascinating. And the aroma.. WOW!
After the tour, you're definitely going to want to pick up some kind of candy. I personally felt compelled "free" some of the poor rejected jellies, those that were too big or too small to be "just right". They call them "Belly Flops" and they are just as tasty as the "normal" beans. :-)
Lot's of gift ideas as well as other candy in the shop downstairs. There is also a cafeteria. But.. although the food I ordered was quite fresh and tasty, I thought a 12 minute wait for a simple 'breakfast burrito" was a little long. Still.. where else would you get Jelly Bean shaped burgers or pizza??
I also LOVE how they decorated everything up for Halloween. Such a fun place to work!

**NOTE: The Jelly Belly website says it's open from 8am, but it doesn't until 9am, and the tours don't start until 9:15.
Also.. right after the tour "begins" there is a photographer taking a picture of each tour group standing in front of a giant stuffed jelly bean. Unless you want to spend an additional $15, $20, $30 on a pretty unimaginative picture AND have to wait back in line while everyone gets their picture taken, I would ask to just move past it to the real excitement.
I wish I could take my kids here...
Definitely recommend!< /text>

< Review>
I love Jelly Belly, so many choices, some nasty,  like who likes vomit flavor? This was my first time here, crazy how long I've been in the bay area, and how I love the TRUE taste of every one!  My daughter, hubby, and my 2 Grandson's, surprised me! I loved the tour, very friendly staff made my experience exciting, a big kid in a candy store, indeed! Sunday, so no production lines in action, but there's lots of other fun... got to have fun smelling, and guessing which flavor it was, my favorite, buttered popcorn, and next is cotton candy, wait...I can't decide...so many great flavors... except the nasty ones...someone loves them! I was very amazed by the portraits, made with different colors, so realistic too! I also learned Ronald Regan ate black licorice flavor to help him stop smoking! I could go and tell much more, but I can't spoil it for others. Then we went to the best spot, The Store! Small, but Very well organized, and a wide selection of candy, toys, shirts, hats, and more, to please everyone, and you can sample lots of flavors, and YUMMY assorted FUDGE, wow! I only spent 20.00, and was able to get small gifts for my other 2 grandchildren, mommy, and dad too! Oh and of course me! I even got a cute retractable jelly belly headphone set for $6.99, for my daughter, as a thank you for a great experience! I really never thought of it being more than candy...it was a great learning experience! If you love jelly belly candy, it's the place to check out...free parking, free to take the tour, learn and see amazing artwork, kids of all ages will enjoy it! At the end of tour, the staff treats you to a FREE small bag of the 20 flavors, photos are taken with the big red jelly belly - at the entrance - ready at end of tour. We didn't buy ours, kind of expensive, and ours wasn't focused, probably due to squeezing all 5 of us in the shot, and it was a very quick "OK say cheese, not worth 25$ for 1 5×7 and 2 small wallets, but there's a little photo booth just before you exit, 3.00 for a strip, better deal! GO HAVE FUN, LEARN, SEE AMAZING BEAN ARTWORK, and more!< /Review>

<Text>The tour was not that amazing as what I thought it was. Especially because I want on the weekend I guess a lot of the workers are off that day so there's not a lot of movement you walking around you can do the tour with in 15 minutes and you're done.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) A great place to spend two hours with the kids, you can add more games for the kids, the training at the factory is excellent, the price of the magnetic image is very expensive $ 28, Gili Billy who end up with the disgusting dishes, but I liked it at all,

(Original)
מקום מצוין לבילוי של שעתיים עם הילדים , אפשר להוסיף עוד משחקיים לילדים , ההדרכה במפעל מצויינת , מחיר התמונה המגנטיית מאוד יקרה 28 $ , גילי בילי שמחלקים בסוף עם המאכלים המגעלים ךא אהבתי בכלל , צריך להשאיר טעם טוב , האוכל במתחם גרוע מאוג ברמה של בית חולים< /Review>

An adorable jelly without! A must stop! When you enter the factory you can do an independent tour and see the entire production floor accompanied by digital explanations. Then they get photographed and get a gift under a jelly without. There is a souvenir shop and there is also a clearance shop on the side - where you sell things that came out of the store. A lovely factory and suitable for an hour and a half stop. do not miss.

לא רק לילדים!
מפעיל מקסים של ג׳לי בלי! חובה עצירה! כשנכנסים למפעל ניתן לעשות סיור עצמאי ולראות את כל רצפת הייצור מלווה בהסברים דיגיטליים. לאחר מכן מצטלמים ומקבלים שי מתחת ג׳לי בלי. יש חנות מזכרות ויש גם חנות קלירנס בצד - בה מוכרים דברים שיצאו מהחנות. מפעל מקסים ומתאים לעצירה של שעה-שעה וחצי. אל תפספסו.</Review>

(Translated by Google) I wouldn't make a detour for the Jelly Belly Company, but if it is on the way (with us between Lake Tahoe and SFO) it is definitely a worthwhile stop with the opportunity to shop in the store or to fortify yourself in the attached café , Free tour of the factory. Sufficient free parking spaces also for campers.

(Original)
Einen Umweg würde ich für die Jelly Belly Company zwar nicht extra machen, wenn es aber am Wegesrand liegt (bei uns zwischen Lake Tahoe und SFO) ist es auf jeden Fall ein lohnender Stop mit der Möglichkeit im Store einzukaufen oder sich im angeschlossenen Café zu stärken. Kostenlose Werksführung. Ausreichend kostenlose Parkplätze auch für Wohnmobile.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Basically, it is a tour program without a guide. It is free. After the tour, hand out simple jelly samples. Because the course itself is short, you can enter within 10 minutes even if you wait.

(Original)
기본적으로 별도의 가이드가 없는 견학 프로그램이고요 무료입니다. 견학을 마치면 간단한 젤리샘플을 하나씩 나눠 줍니다. 코스 자체가 짧은 편이라 기다리는 경우가 발생하더라도 대체로 10분내에 입장 할 수 있습니다.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Nice to see the production.
The free tour (you can see everything at your own pace) is adorned with overpriced photo gifts. Also the reason why we always pass the photo booths.

In the end there are free samples. 3 beans per run. You can also buy merchandise and buy jelly beans in all variations at retail prices.

Also interesting are the kilo packs of sorted beans (crooked and crooked). 1kg / $ 10 and 5 for $ 30

In retrospect, we saw the half-kilo package for $ 3.99 in the grocery outlet market.

It pays to be there early. So you still have your peace of mind and are safe from screaming children.

Ps: next to is also Budweiser;)

(Original)
Mal ganz nett die Produktion zu sehen.
Die gratis Tour (man kann sich nach seinem Tempo alles anschauen), wird geschmückt mit überteuerten Fotogeschenken. Auch der Grund wieso wir an den Fotoständen immer vorbeigehen.

Am Ende gibt es noch gratis Kostproben. 3 Bohnen pro Durchgang. Auch kann man dann Merchandise erwerben und Jelly Beans in allen Variationen zu Einzelhandelspreisen kaufen.

Interessant sind auch die Kilopakete von aussortierten Bohnen (krumm und schief). 1kg / 10$ und 5 für 30$

Im Nachhinein sahen wir das halb Kilopaket für 3,99$ im Grocery Outlet Markt.

Es lohnt sich früh vor Ort zu sein. So hat man noch seine Ruhe und ist vor schreienden Kindern sicher.

Ps: neben an ist auch Budweiser ;)<//Review>
