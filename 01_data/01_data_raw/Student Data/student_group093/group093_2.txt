Place came here to celebrate a birthday on Saturday and were not disappointed!  Everything was delicious and even though there was a prom party in the back the service was excellent!  It is a bit pricey, but if you are looking for a special place to celebrate, this is it!</Text>

<review>First impression. .......... what a difference new ownership and management makes. New bright and illuminated decor has given this establishment a new vibe. Walked in with a reservation and the dinning room was full. The bar was also full. The three of us had sea bass, rib eye steak and chicken carbonara.  All three were great. Calamari appetizer was very crispy but cooked to perfection. Dessert was fabulous mango and raspberry pana cotta perfect and smooth, tiramisu good and creme brulee was so so. Cannot wait to go back< /review>< pictures>

I love this place. It's my neighborhood bar. I don't go there extremely often but when I do, staff is always very welcoming.  Baby dim the lights after 7, I would I appreciate that.<//review>

Service was great and the staff were very friendly and attentive.
The Arancini was cold at the center (though the sauce and stuffing were good) - but our other orders, a salad and the fettuccine were very well done. I will be back.<//text>

Excellent service by polite attentive staff. We had a large group, but disruptions were held to a minimum and everyone was served in timely fashion.  Excellent Old World Italian cuisine, with just a touch of home.  Fabulous sauces, excellent entrees, delightful antipasti and salads. This is one of the best Italian eateries I have ever been to, bar none.  Do yourself a favor, give yourself plenty of time and take a friend and/or loved one. You won't be sorry!

It has the best aspects of chains: squeaky clean furnishings, snappy service; while avoiding their downfalls: generic, normie food. We sat at the bar area.Our food came out quickly.Portions were large, fresh, and delicious.You usually only get to pick two of those, not three.<//text>

<text>The host sat us in the worst spot in the restaurant. We had a reservation and he said all the good tables were booked. 5 minutes later he sat a table of 4 in the middle of the restaurant and where everyone was. They didn’t have a reservation. The food was okay. Our waiter was great. But very disappointed with the host.<//text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80844631fe807093:0x9e4f15c365a32856</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I was a regular, when it was Roberto's. I thought the new owners had the food part down but, I don't think they understood the clientele. Now the management is different and I have to say, I loved everything about this place. The vibe, the food the service!
I'm so happy to have another great Italian restaurant to add to my list of favorites.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Looks kinda rundown on the outside but a bustling well organized restaurant on the inside. We had salmon and the pork chop and a decent bottle of wine. The salmon dish was lovely but the pork chop was a little dry and the veg underdone. I was offered a replacement and when I said no we were immediately offered desert. We appreciated the service and friendly ness, a final comment on the food will have to wait for another time.< /text>

The wait staff is very professional - very similar to Europe. We eat at least three or four times a month here because we always walk away satisfied with a meal I know I can not duplicate and I love to cook. They bought an expensive pasta maker that makes perfect paper thin papparadelle noodles.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80844631fe807093:0x9e4f15c365a32856<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>I will never, ever eat Basilico again.

We made confirmed reservations via Open Table for tonight at 7:00pm for four people.  It was confirmed by Basilico by text and by email.

We showed up precisely at 7:00pm and were told by a hostess that they didn't have a table available for us.  I said "we made a reservation a week ago and the restaurant confirmed it".  She said they didn't have a table for us.  I was obviously upset, as this was the first chance we'd had to see our door neighbors since both our house burned down last Oct.  We were then told they could seat us "downstairs".  Downstairs is an open, meeting room, with no ambience and felt like a barn.

Given no choice we reluctantly took the table.  Another hostess seated us and apologized, stating "she should have saved you a table".  She stated "you should call the owner".  Iasked for his name and phone number - - we never received it.  After we were seated the original hostess came down and asked if there was anything she could do.  I said "a complimentary round of drinks would be nice".  She said "I'll have to call the owner".  We never heard from her again and nothing was comped on the check.

It got worse.  As if they were trying to ignore or punish us, we didn't get water, bread or a server for 20 minutes.  I finally waived a busboy over and got water for us.  Then nothing.  I finally waived down a waiter serving another table and said "we have not seen a server, asked if we wanted a drink, we've been ignored".  He took our drink orders, later our appetizer order and finally our dinner order. The appetizers and dinner came and that's the last we saw of our server until we were finished.  We ordered dessert and coffee which came.  Then we couldn't find our waiter to get our check.  It took 15 minutes for him to bring us a check.

This is factually true.  I would not go to Basilico.  If you make a reservation be prepared for them to tell you they haven't saved you a table and offer to seat you "downstairs" in a bare hall-like room.

There are many far better places to eat where customers are valued and respected.<//text></record></dataset><record>

We had a fantastic time dining at Somm’s Kitchen run by the multitalented Ian. Conceptually the experience is a surprise tasting menu supercharged with trophy wines and liquors. This all takes place at a 12 seat curved bar where you can see Ian assemble each menu item. Ian slow prepares the items in advance using slow cooking, curing, sous vide, etc. and then finishes the dishes in front of you. The food is great but then he uses his sommelier background to pair wines and in our case bourbons with each course. And not just any wines or bourbons, Ian is looking to take the mystique out of the trophy or cult brands (like Bryant Family, Saxum, Sine Qua Non, Stagg) and happily pours these to get diner reactions. The result by the end of the night will leave you in a state of rapture and eager to plan your next visit.< /Text>

Ian is providing food and wine a thousand steps above anything you are getting anywhere else. Smoked/dehydrated/rehydrated tomotaes were unlike anything else and delicious.  A steak better than any restaurant or home.  Homemade duck sausage with foie gras.  Risotto/raisin pudding and 16 day reduced oranges.  All of it paired with wine you won't have elsewhere.  A truly singular experience.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80ecc567f7e71789:0x931fabd7ab7b7890<//Gmap_id><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcfOfwsisshwwYK5f3zGME3NqA_xJ4PNkWIhyI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_8llRS0BECboqdv_T5Uaoit2K1ep3JyjTDibV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2iYjtJHc47V1sgq3j8S3YqZnaz1afJbdUnvMi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJyUesYa1ws09Ih1wLubxJa82miEt0GIilSfOM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics></record>

I've been twice with my husband. First for our anniversary and again 6 weeks later to bring family last night. Ian and his staff are absolutely amazing and very welcoming. The food is inventive and delicious, but not stuffy. Ian's explanations of the food and wine are fascinating and down to earth. He is more than happy to try to accommodate allergies and preference (my husband isnt big on seafood). If you like good food and wine then hands down this is an experience that should not be missed whether you're visiting or a local like us. There's  no set menu to allow room for new experiments and to vary based on seasonal ingredients. Be sure to plan ahead as he books up!<//Text>

<review>We did the chefs table.... Absolutely amazing experience. The man, the myth, the legend! I had heard him throughout the Paso Robles area from other industry and it was truely spectacular experience from the wine to the food to conversation. Blows doors on any other intimate food experience you could have. And BONUS now does liquor pairings with aged whiskey varieties. Blended beautifully with the wine. I am definitely going to come back and bring friends. This dude knows his stuff and humble brag he’s truely one a kind!< /review>< username>

I’m still on the fence on this one.  On one hand I had a great experience wine tasting.   Food was tasty but left me quite hungry.  Had to go eat a real meal afterwards.

Let me explain.

About a dozen of you sit around a long circular bar type counter.  Owner/chef assembles small dishes that he pairs with wine.   Food is not cooked in front of you and is fairly easy to pull off.  Chef claims to have worked at a Michelin restaurant but these are not fancy dishes.

We had appetizers like sliced meats and cheese.  Also a warm soup.   Then came a chunk of salmon and a bit of steak.   Each dish was quite good but did not quite make a meal.  And I’m a small guy who typically does not eat much.

Each dish, however, was paired with a wine.  Wine education and pairing is the real strength here.    We had two kinds of bubblies, whites and reds.   They all quite good and paired really well.   When your glass was empty he would pour some more.   So that part was quite nice.

The seating is a bit peculiar.  Some people get the good seats and get to see what he is doing and others sit on the sides and don’t get much of his attention.  The people who came the latest (the ones we all had to wait for) got the best seats so not sure how that works.

Part of the way through another group enters and they sit in a back room.   Now they get part of the chef’s attention too.

Overall it was a fun experience. There was plenty of good wine to drink, but don’t expect a filling meal.  Would I go back?   Yah, likely, but I’d eat first.<//Text>

<text>My boyfriend and I had an amazing experience! I highly recommend this intimate dinner setting if you love wine and food. Ian provides seating at the bar for 14 so we were lucky someone cancelled and we were able to fill their spots. Otherwise, you must make a reservation in advance.

Ian is very knowledgable and thoughtful about how specific wines can be paired with the food. This was unlike anything we have ever seen before and were so happy to have had the pleasure of meeting Ian and tasting his passion through each food and wine pairing. We loved that it was an educational evening as he spoke about each wine and the process of each dish presented to us.

It is very clear that Ian has the heart, passion, and knowledge for wine as well as food and it was really great to step into his world for the evening. This is a must-do in Paso Robles and we will definitely be back!< /text><UserId.>112393643403560969633<//UserId.><time>1584464579872</time><user_name>Danielle Fisher<//user_name><rate>5< /rate><gmap_id>0x80ecc567f7e71789:0x931fabd7ab7b7890< /gmap_id><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOep1hA8CLgVYjtaMZmx-mrjbBLl0tsiwWx3gui=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Somm's was one of the best dining experiences we have ever had. Ian prepared at least 8 courses paired with 12 to 14 wines. Both the food and wine were incredible. It has an intimate atmosphere, and Ian does a great job explaining both the food and wine, without the pretentious feel that can sometimes come with fine dining. We will definitely be going back. You won't find a better food and wine experience for the money. Somm's is a must stop if you're in Paso!< /Review>

<Review>One of the best dinner/meal experiences of a lifetime. Ian has created such a comfortable welcoming environment for an interesting, modern culinary experience for the central coast. Surrounded by strangers, some local, some from afar, all sitting, enjoying, and learning together about wine and the food beautifully plated in front of us. A modern atmosphere for dinner can be intimidating; Ian seamlessly provides a humble setting while serving Michelin-star ingredients. This is top notch for California cuisine. It's so wonderful to watch a chef-somm smile all night as he pours wine into glasses, informing and intriguing his guests about what he truly cares about, course after course. Amazing night, meal, and company! Pictured is a beautiful orange cooked for 12 DAYS!!!!< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDCIlHWFLmC7buWxWVaGFtVnmvLGjB79VIjMJD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

Where do I begin, Ian is truly a master in the art of all things food. Every dish is tasty and complements one another. Wine pairings are thoughtful and creative. Each dish comes with an insightful, summarized explanation of the artistic process Ian takes to execute each meal. Foodies, don’t look anywhere else. This place is a gem, make your reservations early and plan for a one of a kind gastronomic experience.<//review>

Dining at Somm’s Kitchen is like attending a dinner party where you know next to know one but by the end of it you’re making plans and are the best of friends. From the moment you walk in until you leave you feel like a guest in his home. Ian has perfected hospitality.

And all while being chef, maître d’, and sommelier. I know of no where else you can find an experience like Somm’s Kitchen.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Go here. Experience this. Seriously. You’ll regret it if you don’t. We started our weekend in Paso here and it was the best food and wine pairing I’ve ever had. Ian hosts a night of amazing food, great conversation, exceptional wine and best of all it was relaxed and non pretentious. Ian is like a unicorn that I can only dream of becoming...he knows good wine and will tell you all about it (already super impressive) and then he comes out of the kitchen with these incredible dishes that take several days to create and you’re just blown away by it all. A chef and a somm? Could you ask for a better experience? Thanks for hosting us Ian, we’ll be back!<//Text>

<Text>Somms is a “do not miss” if you’re traveling to Paso! We are never disappointed and always delight in Ian’s personal touches and flare. It’s impossible  to pick a favorite out of the evenings fare.... instead we just pick a date of when we’re coming back.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>Absolutely amazing. Every course was expertly paired with a wine. nothing but the finest cuisines and wines were served here. It is an absolute foody delight. If you have the chance to stop here you would be doing a disservice if you skipped it. Worth every penny. Check it out you'll thank me later!<//review>< Name>

Small bites. Wine pairings. And best of all, it is extremely fun.

I cant recommend this place enough. And make reservations. Only 14 seats and one seating per night.<//review></record></dataset><record>

We keep coming back for new and exciting tastings.  The best variety you can find.  Never disappoints.  Plus a very comfortable learning experience whether you are a novice or experienced taster you will come away with a happy palate and a greater appreciation for wine and food pairing< /text>

Somm's kitchen. Be ready for a unique experience!  This is not a run of the mill restaurant. It's a "By reservation only" you and the Chef experience. Be prepared for quite a few exceptional small bites paired with wine from all over the world. It's not a meal that will set you back a few pounds, but you will be intrigued by the personal attention and care given to each dish. Reservations could be a month out.<//Review>

I was fortunate enough to have been accommodated the first night I was in town. The experience was SO good that, being able to get a seat there the next evening was one of the factors weighing into whether or not I was going to book my hotel for another night. The universe was smiling upon me when they could accommodate me again. Trust me when I say that, this place is an immense bargain at $100 per person.

The evening was like a super fun dinner party, and a sense of community was shared with everyone’s mutual love of great wine and food. I don’t think I could pass through Paso again, without stopping here.< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Last night i celebrated my birthday with an outstanding culinary experience in paso robles.  Somm's Kitchen does an 8 course meal with a custom selected wine pairing from the phenomenal Chef Ian.  There was nothing served that was short of spectacular. The seating is 14 people who you get familiar with as the meal is served over a 3 hour period.  Im a full on foodie and i would say this is the best experience I've had.  This rivals or perhaps eclipses anything you'd fine in any major city.  I'd highly recommend you experience this for yourself (don't let the price deter you it's worth that and more truly loook atw hat they charge for similar culinary adventures in San Francisco and Chicago)!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

This is a fantastic little restaurant. Shared 7 plates between 3 of us and it was some of the most exquisite favors and satisfying food that I have ever eaten. The essence of orange was the most amazing dessert that I have ever had.< /Review>

The night my wife and I stopped here we were lucky. The owner was serving for us. I let him choose our tasting and boy was I pleasantly surprised. He asked a little about what we wanted, then took over from there. By the end our "blind" tasting I was in love with Syrah. Before walking into Somm's Kitchen Syrah was one my least favorite varietals. They know what they are doing and how to do it.

Be prepared. There are only a few seats around the bar. I will go here first the next time we visit.< /review><username>Tre' Grisby<//username><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>Ian is incredibly knowledgeable on wine and food, but has the ability to cut through the technical terms and give you a fundamental understanding of how to identify the grape and assess them and determine what you like (or don't like)
He calls it BLIC...Balance, Lenght, Intesity, & Complexity...
Not enough space to tell you more but if you are ever in Paso Robles CA you have check him out.<//Review>< Pics>

First time in Paso Robles and happened upon this gem. Amazing Jamon Iberico to start, but the suggested pairing was something I never would have chosen, but unexpected excellence is rare these days and this place delivers. Do think, just communicate your taste and enjoy.<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Very special. As good wine+food pairings as you will find. Many Old World gems, a few local wines in the mix, Ian is the man. We enjoyed the limited seating around the bar setup, but if you want a table go to Bistro Laurent or Artisan or Il Cortile. Everthing was 5* so challenging to pick a standout. The duck breast comes to mind.</review>< Pictures>

I love walking into a new situation and not being exactly sure what I'm about to experience.  I love even more walking out thinking I can't WAIT to tell others that they need to experience this, too!

I think if people consider going to Somm's kitchen buying a ticket to an experience instead of paying a bill for dinner they'll get far more out of the ride.

On March 9, my husband and I were visiting Somm's kitchen from Austin, Texas.  We had been in Paso for the first time last year before this restaurant opened, so we were excited to try something new on the square.  We made a reservation about a month before.  When we walked in, Ian told us our spot was at the end of his semi circular bar which had enough room for about 14 people.

Ian greeted us and asked, "Are you hungry?"  We stated we were, and he handed us a glass of a most interesting Austrian sparkling wine.  We had no menu in front of us, wine or otherwise.  There was nothing to suggest what we might be eating, what we might be drinking, how many courses there may be, or even how much things might cost.

I'm sure we could have asked Ian, but we decided we were in for the ride!  For the next two hours we were in his hands as he had us try a local cheese, a foie gras that rivaled that of Michelin starred restaurants, a prime filet, lamb, and on and on...

It seemed some people came and went and didn't stay for the whole ride.  I'm not sure if all the kinks are ironed out there, but it didn't hinder our experience at all.

Each course was served with about a half of a glass of wine...unless of course you drank your wine, then more showed up.  None of the wines were particularly expensive, but all were particularly wonderful and the best paired I've ever had with any food ANYWHERE (and not to get all foodie/wine snobby... but we've been to Picasso, Cyrus, Robuchon... the pairing at Somm's Kitchen was simply AMAZING!)

The whole time we felt as though we were Ian's guests.  He chatted to us about the wines and the food and how he had prepared each thing.  At one point, he stopped and gave us a lesson in wine tasting.  It was taught in such a way that novice and experienced wine aficionados a like could enjoy. Ian is an experienced sommelier who teachers wine classes internationally, so getting a chance to experience this was quite a thrill!

In the French style, Ian prepared a salad between the final course and the desserts.  The salad was so creative.  He peeled the quail eggs and prepared it in front of us.  He carefully cut and placed herbs from right to left and as you ate, the herbs and the flavors increased in intensity with each bite.

We finished with desserts and feeling like we had made friends with our fellow diners and our host.

Our final bill was $250 for the two of us.  Both my husband and I felt this was truly a bargain.  We have paid more for less in the past.

Now, for the "to be completely honest" parts.  I would have liked a menu at least when we left if not to follow at the time.  Ian did say that I could email him and he would send a menu with all the information.  I intend to do that, but it would have been nice to look over it that evening, or even as I was writing this review.

Also, I'm not sure exactly how he decided who got what food.  There was a woman sitting next to me who I ran into twice again in the week while we were there.  Each time I saw her someplace else, she was telling other people that she was upset that she asked for potatoes and didn't get them even though some people did.  She did not like her experience at all and thought Ian was rude.  I thought he was funny and dry.  I liked his sense of humor, but I could see where others might find him off putting.  He's a New Yorker, not a Californian... and he still has some of the edge.

I also heard some complain about the price.   I think ANYWHERE you go 11 courses and 11 half glasses of wine for $125 a person is an amazing bargain... but I understand if you're thinking your'e only going to spend $50 on dinner.. this would be a little rough.</Text>

The Sledhill will be one of the best workouts of your life, and the most fun! We have been coming here for the last 15 years. Awesome place to learn some ski and snowboard moves. Everything can be rented, not allowed to bring your own sleds. Snow machine applies fresh layer for the slide Hill. Small kids snow play area is new and a great place for photos and kids to play without getting whacked in the head with a snowboard. They have a food truck and beers are available at their ticket window.< /review>

This was our first time and we got stuck with the slightly remodeled rooms.  The old closet door broke on day one. We had a stove from back in the 70s. Our coffee pot had a crack in it and making coffee did not work well. My husband noticed they had a Keurig and requested if we could have one for our room.  There were food crumbs and dirt under the coach. We were able to clean it but the other room had carpet, who knows what was hiding in it!  The front desk staff were not rude but they weren’t going out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.  These rooms were not inexpensive.
The three stars is for the ample space we got for our family of five. We got a king, queen and sofa bed. Two fulls would have been better than one queen. This resort is great for families with elementary school kids.< /text>

Maybe the best ski area in Tahoe to bring beginners who want to learn to ski. It is small, easy to navigate and it's just so easy to get onto the hill. It does not offer much terrain for anybody who's above an immediate. But to get someone started skiing or snowboarding there's just no better place. Food truck serves deceptively good and authentic mexican food.</Review>

We had a great time snow sledding.

The staff was very considerate as my family missed our reservation time due to traffic. They accommodated our problem by putting us in the next time slot.

The food truck had great Mexican food.

Needless to say, we are definitely going back.</Text>

SNOWSCHOOLERS is the BEST for KIDS!!! Granlibakken, AMAZING -- FORGET MT Rose --- ROSEBUDS --- the thorns of this program nearly killed my kids loving spirit - Mr Rose ROSEBUDS and DAVE the worst, RESTORED faith by kindness at Granlibakken SKI SCHOOL, which they call SnowSchoolers!! We spent a lot of money at Mt Rose, as it had a nice bunny hill and magic carpet, the ski teachers were OKAY for a group lesson, so we returned three weeks later and hoped to book a full week. We waited for our shuttle that never arrived, two hours early we had to make the decision to load our seven year old twins, gear, and BURN RUBBER to make it to Mount Rose, we were 18 minutes late and DAVE the MT ROSE MANAGER, a HORRIBLE MAN - who was dishonest and presented to our seven year old they would be PUNISHED FROM JOINING the $350 dollar ONE HOUR lesson because " they were late'  and fully intended to teach our little boys a cruel lesson of blame, would not allow them to gear up and wait at the magic carpet to join the class.  There were 4 kids, when MEAN DISHONEST DAVE the manager lied and said there were 15 ( my little boys can count at age seven, and noticed this as we sat and watched the class barely go ONE FIRST HILL run,  they cried, it was awful -- the whole staff at Mt Rose, including the GM named PAUL - who ran out the back door, after seeing my boys sobbing, ALL HORRIBLE to deal with - even though they could tell everything about DAVE THE LOOSER MANAGER OF ROSEBUDS was WRONG and HORRIBLE to put our little boys through this, they did nothing - PAUL the GM running out the back door, shows you the weak leadership in this operation, we will not RETURN -
THE GOOD NEWS IS -- my full intent in raising boys and future leaders, is the REAL LESSON - -WHEN LIFE GIVE YOU LEMONS make LEMONADE --SO WE FOUND GRANLIBAKKEN -- we met a great guy BRIAN --- we wanted to pay for a half day, but spring conditions he was honest enough to say AN HOUR would probably be enough, geared up and they giggled, and had fun and learned SO MUCH -- Brian and the SNOWSCHOOLERS saved our day, and showed my boys what true leadership means.  It was mid day, Brian had no instructors left, so HE -- the OWNER of the school, went to his car and donned his own gear to inspire our boys TO SKI. This was there first year of solo skiing, and we really wanted to end the year with a good solid lesson series, we CANCELLED MEXICO and decided to invest in the Tahoe Ski Schools because we COULD and we SHOULD help small business that suffered as ours did, the year of 2020.  We did our part, and we are glad our investment went towards increasing our boys positive experience in Skiing, Brian and the Granlibakken SnowSchoolers turned our lemon of a day, ( HORRIBLE MT ROSE EXPERIENCE ) into lemonade !!! WONDERFUL day skiing and then ZOOMING down the sled hill, we love this place, next year we will rent and stay here for sure.
GREAT laid back kind friendly attitude that makes skiing all it should be, wonderful for families and stepping up to the plate instead of making little boys cry and suffer for things beyond their control,  was simply an essential lesson all around in our day.  Thank you Brian, we shall never forget you and I hope you got our note to you as we squeezed it under the door to say thanks. HIGHLY RECOMMEND making a U - TURN at Mt Rose and choosing Granlibakken SnowSchoolers instead for a great experience. We shall see you next year, for sure.

<GmapID>0x80997d88a3630ec7:0x30c3373b77f6c7b4<//GmapID><text>Great place for beginners!  We came on a Saturday morning right at opening and were able to get fitted with snowboards fairly quickly.  There was a long line after us so we are glad we got in early.  The people helping us were very knowledgeable and friendly.  The two options for skiing/snowboarding were perfect - the bunny slope for newbies and the other one for ones who want to challenge themselves more.  Good thing you can get off the lift at different heights so you can work up to going higher up.  The sledding hill was also a ton of fun, the pass came with the snowboard lift ticket which was perfect.  People either used their supplied saucers or brought their own.  There are four sections at the top and once it got really busy, there was a worker who helped regulate which group would go down, to avoid any crashes (smart!).  You can get pretty good speed going down, just watch out for people crossing at the bottom heading towards the path back up.
We spent the whole morning snowboarding/sledding and had a quick lunch break - their burritos and super nachos were actually pretty good.
When we left in the early afternoon (~1pm) there were a lot of cars and it looked hard to get parking.  Thankful we got there at opening and parked in their first spot!  We will definitely return if we are in the area again, we really enjoyed it!<//text><username>Debbie H</username></record>

This was the first time I've gone sledding. It was a solid hour of fun. I came New year's day so it was pretty crowded but it only took like five minutes to get a run in. Make sure to buy your tickets online to avoid the lines. The lady at the bottom is pretty intense. She kept yelling at everyone to show down.< /Review>

< review>
Kids had a great day sledding today. Cost was $25 each due to the holiday. It was fairly busy, but not too bad. We stayed about 3 hours and the kids went down the sledding hill about 6 about times. The cafe there is ok. Prices are fair, but the line was long at times. I would return here for sure. They provide the saucers. You can also buy your ticket online to save time when you arrive, but finding the person that handles the online tickets was a challenge. They also have ski school and you can rent equipment as well. They have a nice ski hill for those that are past the basics, but not good enough for an advanced course/run.< /review>

<text>The sledding hill was large enough for big and little kids alike.  You will need to walk yourself back up the hill but it's still a ton of fun.  There was only one person behind The counter so it took awhile to get checked in.  It looks like the snack bar and restaurant is closed during the week so that's a bit of a bummer.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMr8V-4fINeI5d0SRvVSQP95DID2jkPcXydiVxJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbGAUjJKgVEM7XZZpcOcnQz5dz07kCbHE85YTE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMb6oQIlCfisquyUa4adwyNQJ0bzIqwEqBElyuD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPn4XASPncv-8dtwFV8vMFCtNSpoJS5T6MNaT8p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

Good slope on sled hill.

Though little improvements like stronger tubs needed!! I broke 2 myself. It might someone.  Other than that everything is great. Service here is better than many other places near by.<//Review>

1st time there. Husband and I took the kiddos (10 and 12 year old boys) we all had a blast. Only $20 to get into the sledding area and includes a saucer/disk. The ones they provide are better. Next time I'd like to stay at their resort which takes more planning. If you don't know how to ski but want to have wild fun in the snow.. I recommend. Thumbs up.</review>

Showed up at 12 and they were closing at 2 so we got half price ($8.50) tickets. They have great sleds (don't bring your own, it doesn't cost extra). Walking up the hill is a little tiring but fun. Worth the price. Clean restrooms. Fun!</text>

I showed up around an hour and a half before closing and they were nice enough to give me half off for my two kids. So I only paid $17 for both of them for sledding. They walked up that hill countless times and had a blast. They also have an area for beginners learning skiing and snowboarding, but we didn't partake, but we may in the future. Back to the sledding. They had some nice attentive workers that stand at the bottom of the hill and do their best to prevent collisions and prevent injuries, they did a great job and saved my kids a few times. I will without a doubt go again.<//Review>< date>

Lessons and rentals are available, and a lift ticket to the ski hill also includes sledding for the day, a great value.\n\nThank you again for your review, and we hope that you visit again soon!'}< /resp>

< Review>
tl;dr this place is great for kids of all ages and is worth the visit.

We came to this place on a whim and do not regret it. The location is a little tucked away, which may, or may not, be a good thing. Once you arrive there is plenty of parking. My family and I went sledding, and it was a blast. My kiddo was wiped out in no time because the sledding area requires all sledders to climb up a hill. There are two hill to choose from: 1. Main hill that picks up speed fast. I wouldn't recommend anyone under the age of 5 or 6 try this unless they are brave. 2. A smaller hill that is perfect for smaller children. There is also a skiing/snowboarding area; however, we didn't do that this time. I recommend this place!!< /Review>

<review>It's  good small place to try out winter sports, especially for smaller kids. The highlight was definitely the sledding! That was a blast!  I would rate this higher but their t bar lifts are very difficult to navigate for beginners (snowboarding). Our kids struggled with them and ended up just walking up the hills.< /review>< gmapID>

A great low-key resort for families with small kids looking for a beginner skiing experience or a monitored sledding hill. Parking is limited but right next to snow play area.< /Review>

First time here today. Amazing experience!
They did a full synthetic oil change and had me in and out in about 30mins. Workers are super nice and awesome. I used to go to the dealership and pay for wayyy over priced services. But not anymore! Definitely recommend D&M auto for ALL your car services!!</review>

Just want to shout out about D & M Auto and the great service I received from Dan and all of his mechanics! I've had a relationship with D&M Auto for at least 15 years and they have never let me down. This last Saturday I needed my starter changed and I called in in the morning and even though he was booked he was able to fit me in I dropped off my truck at 10 in the morning and by one my truck was fixed the price was excellent and the service was even better I'm so thankful for the professionalism of the people at D & M Auto! I hope you get to read this Dan just want you to know you're amazing! Sincerely your friend Simon zapien</review>

I’ve have been coming here for about six years or more. I am very selective where I take my vehicles to be serviced, especially because I cover some much territory on a daily basis. I love the professional, friendly and attentive customer service provided to me and my sons. We are always greeted with a friendly hello and a smile. Plus, most honest and affordable!!! Highly recommend this place to get your car serviced.< /Review>

<Review>I was looking for a reliable and trusted shop to take care of my cars and I found this place, everything I can says this guys are really good,  they do the AC  and oil change to my Volvo this morning and everything works pretty well, very nice and good customer service, the service was done fast that its important to me because I don't have too much time available for this but this guys did a great job, now they have a new customer and I have a trusted worthy place to take my cars. I Highly recommended this automotive service.< /Review>< pics>

Always the BEST in Tracy. The owner, Dan, is terrific and honest to a fault. I have no qualms about sending my wife there alone and know he'll take good care to her and give her his honest opinion on the problem and his best price. I've been going to D&M Automotive for the last 7 years and reccomend D&M to anyone I know that needs a good, honest shop to go to.</review>

Great place. Didn't know it was there until someone referred me there. And Dan was a class act and very helpful. One of the nicer guys to meet. Fair prices and great service. He helped me out in a really ruff spot when in need of a car when mine broke down for good and I will not forget that. My car wasn't worth the fix. Too old. But I am thankful for Dan working with me and helping out someone he never met. Need more shops like this.< /Text>

I love this place. I can't say enough about Dan and his team. Very friendly and professional. Dan will take care of your car at a fair price. I've been going to him for 5 years and will continue to go here. Don't miss out on their oil change special on the website!</Text>

D&M auto have been helping my family with our cars for the past several years and they have always been super helpful and fair.  They are experienced, knowledgeable and straight-forward.  Definitely recommend!<//text>

Dan and his staff are top notch!

I had an engine replaced in my Nissan Xterra at D&M. The repair cost was far less than anywhere else.

They truly went above and beyond with constant communication, time of completion, recommending repairs or replacement of related parts that really did need to be replaced (hoses, belts, filters, plugs, radiator, clutch fan, cam position sensors and other parts).

They coordinated with my local parts store to make sure they had the parts they need for the job. I did supply the radiator and fan clutch, but not a problem for me!

They also have good diagnostic skills that may lead to a part needing replacement or repair that will save you money in the long run. They made every effort to do a complete job that is very hard to question or doubt.

All my future repair needs, as well as any recommendations will be coming to D&M.

<review>Typical Monday as most would say, everything that could go wrong, did... Late for a doctor's appointment, pouring rain, 2 sick and fussy kids in the van, an hour away from home and our van overheated and steering was out of whack.. Took my vehicle to D&M Automotive where they assessed and diagnosed the problem quickly and were more than polite and hospitable as my family and I waited for the work to be done. They were able to do everything in under an hour and at a reasonable price too! I highly recommend these mechanics to anyone in the Tri-valley area!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Absolutely horrific customer service. Our vehicle was taking their via tow as we were told they did not take advantage of their customers. However,  they were dishonest and we were overcharged. Check engine light is on in vehicle and they refuse to address it without further payment. Do not take your car here!!!  Called to address the issue and Dan did not care at all.</Text>

<Review>I  went to them because of the good reviews. but too many times, i paid them only to find that the same issue remain,  then they would find more things.   Even with an appointment they didnt  start working on my car.  I finally called them in the afternoon,  because they wouldn't call me, I was told they would need to keep the car overnight . i finally decided that i couldn't trust this company and went elsewhere. Dan is really nice, but i just dont trust the skill level of his employees.  Whether on purpose or by accident, when they "fix" an issue, they either have to redo it or  something else goes wrong  a few weeks later that you have to bring it back.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I had been a long time customer of Firestone until some snafu with my head gaskets.  Ended up coming here and had the problem fixed while I was away traveling. This happened about a year ago, so I'm fuzzy on some details, I just know that a part was damaged or something when they pulled it out, and they replaced it no charge; were very honest.  After the amazing experience and reasonable pricing I became a constant face here. I get all my routine maintenance here and am very happy with it every time. One time I was leaving after a service and a light came on as I drove away. Dan took the time to look at it, look it up, determine it wasn't something he could do with his equipment(a tire thing), but did research and told me what to expect and what tricks to look out for. This place restored my faith in automotive places after being swindled by earlier shop. Thanks Dan and all the D and M guys!!<//review>< Pics>

I think not.  The guy in charge is too busy to be polite or diagnose.  Schedule me for 1/2 and said you want me to diagnose ?    Umm.  NO.  I'm going somewhere else!   If I was going to diagnose myself I would not have scheduled an appointment.  No need to waste your time giving you money !< /Text>

<text>Last Saturday, I visited this store, initially I have been told cost would around $219 for oxygen sensor and then later I talked to Dan, he told that it would take 1 1/2 hr. inconsistency of information from the people from this store.
Also, initially he told that he will order the part for around $ 85 bucks, they fixed the car with existing oxygen sensor ( without even asking me)  and later they told that they fixed the issue it by cleaning the existing oxygen sensor because they could not get the right part on Saturday.  I requested get the new part , but on Monday, I came to know now part become costly and whole thing will cost more than $300.
here are my concerns :
1) information are not consistent from people of this tore
2) they don't even ask before fixing the stuff
3) they buy the part even though things are not needed<//text><gmap_id>0x80903d5a9b2f01ad:0x23954d491a5a8ec3< /gmap_id>< resp>

But the food is a disaster really the worst crab cake no flavor could have been anything deep fried. The pasta all watering and need some real salt! The beef fajitas was alright but looks more like a giant burrito the flavor was alright nothing wow. Best luck< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Good service, but the food needs work. We ordered fajitas, and while the veggies and chicken tasted good, it came plopped on a spinach wrap with rice and nothing else. Drinks were average.

Excellent restaurant!  The food was tasty and restaurant was extremely busy and tight.  It's great food. Can't find too many Burmese food like theirs.  I felt like I was in another country.  They really take pride in their food and work.  5-Recommendation.<//Text>

Don't let the empty patio fool you, it's just cold outside. Tucked away indoors behind the taco joint is a magnificent eatery with Spanish rock pop establishing the ambience. From the moment we went over the house specials with server Alex to the moment the last drop of bottomless champagne was drained away, the service, the draft beer, and signature dishes did not disappoint. The titular Antigua seafood linguini was great, and so is the mango tuna tartar. The surf and turf was well balanced as well with the mushroom cream sauce to the perfectly medium rare Angus steak. Lastly, the lounging couch in the washroom corridor was also a nice touch. Would visit again.< /review>

I had ordered some food to go since i passed through this city when heading back home to San Diego.
The Fettuccine Alfredo was flavorless and full of oil however i do appreciate the abundance of cheese.
The calamari was actually good, well fried and no presence of sogginess.
The onion rings and fries were O.K.
the caesar salad was as good as the store bought salad at my local supermarket.

I paid about 50 dollars and expected flavor.</Text>

Awesome margaritas, excellent service, gas station quality pizzas. This place has all the potential, and maybe their other menu items knock it out of the park, but the pizza tastes worse than reheated freezer pizza.< /Review>

<Review>This was my first time at Antigua.  The decor has not changed much since it was a Japanese restaurant, but it is still very comfortable and pleasant. It was certainly spotlessly clean. The staff was very friendly and inviting. The food was nice, tasty, well prepared and plated. There were not may patrons there, but they have tons of seating in/out. People who are downtown should give it a try. The prices are not too expensive for a tourist town, which was refreshing.</Review><gmap_id>0x80db1b52e842cc7f:0x6a2ca7eaddf53cb1< /gmap_id></record>

<username>Michelle Yankey</username><pictures>None</pictures><text>I am new to the area, and this place has been consistent with the high quality of the food and drink. I watched the bartender check to my glass several times before making my drink. "Cleanliness is next to godliness."

The wait staff was attentive and friendly. I was very happy with the service and I will be back on a Friday Saturday or Sunday. Because l know that my favorite bartender Saúl will be there!< /text><response>None<//response><Time>1569813461393<//Time><gmapID>0x80db1b52e842cc7f:0x6a2ca7eaddf53cb1<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The avocado and hummus appetizers were ok, but overly pricey for the portion size. The staff was friendly but service was extremely slow (was able to get only 2 drinks in over 2 hours). The calamari are literal rubber. The chop salad was decent, but a chop salad is pretty hard to mess up. Others were not happy with their dishes such as the shrimp rose and lobster ravioli. Overall, the price charged is not justified at all by the lack of quality. There are significantly better establishments in close proximity in the same price point.<//review>

<Text>Fresh, delicious food! We shared the garden pasta and the Antigua chopped salad and it qas more than enough for the both of us. Great service, pleasant ambience. We also had the bottomless champagne for $10 a price hard to beat. Dog friendly you should give it a taste if in Palm Springs! We will be back next trip! 😁<//Text>< Pics>

Family owned and staffed by family, you can depend on quality meals and prompt, friendly service.
They are happy to make substitutions at no extra charge and even accommodate requests. I ordered a cocktail and requested my own recipe and received a perfect drink to my specifications!
We four ordered completely different style entrees and shared a cornucopia of amazing delights!

I ordered the pink matcha that has rose and beet juice in it and it was perfectly delicious and not overly sweet. I also had the tomato mozzarella flatbread pastry and thought it was tasty and a great savory snack. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, and even a little dog bed for your BFF who wants to lounge with you. It’s kinda tucked into an alley, so park wherever and then make your way down Miller Alley rather than going on union etc.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0HOK7UNloPjmoBovWe2M3o0Oor9HADDSePfxZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEfuEU22jT4lRST_RW0ihAOrL7GbrsXPcyC_Jx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTqV5rxQgOkkkJ2GA0l5O3nyKn8_cfMEGbI9lH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>{'time': 1621829716591, 'text': 'You’re making us blush, Katherine!

The place is very cute and the coffee is good but your staff need to drop the attitude. I went Saturday afternoon and there were only 2 other customers waiting. The cashier was very sweet and helpful as it was my first time there. I paid for my drink and moved to the side/back to wait for it to be ready. Another staff says “can i help you with something?” I replied I was waiting to which says “she (the cashier) told you to wait outside”. Luckily, my drink was ready so I left. Sorry Im partially deaf and didnt know I was supposed to wait outside. Between  the partition, masks and music playing its a wonder anyone can hear anything. I won’t be going back.< /Text>

My husband and I wanted to try a few new places in the Pasadena area, and while walking around, we came across a sign on the Main Street, saying there were coffee and plants in the back. We followed the sign a little back patio, and came across hands-down the cutest coffee shop I have ever seen. We are both crazy coffee nuts, and we have travelled the world (Germany, Armenia, Dubai, Greece, several states) looking for great coffee shops. This place easily makes the top 5 list. Easily.

I’m not a fan of non dairy options, so when the owner, AC, told us everything was dairy free, I was worried I wouldn’t like the taste. He recommended trying oat milk, because it’s the closest to dairy options. My husband got a cappuccino with almond milk, and I got myself an oat milk 24k chocolate latte.

The drinks are delicious. Seriously delicious. I could not tell that my drink was missing dairy.

We also bought a cute little Coffee & Plants pin, something to take home, and I wanted to spend more money in the cafe.

I cannot begin to explain how cute this place is. It’s a little tight, and finding parking is a pain, but once you’re inside it’s hard to want to leave. Highly recommend and I’ll definitely be back.

Good coffee spot that's probably way better when itt's not covid. The drinks were great but the atmosphere of the shop and the instagrammableness of the drinks are probably much more appealing than the flavors of the drinks themselves.

They had some pretty unique coffee drinks with gold, lavendar, and other flavors but they seemed a bit overpriced for a take out drink. Came to support the business during the hard time and try something new but can't wait to be able to sit down outside in the patio and hang out with friends.

Parking really isn't great in the area, but there's a garage with one hour free near the apple store around the corner and metered street parking on side streets.

Can't wait to try this place again soon!<//Text>

<Review>This is the sort of cafe where you'll spend the first 30 seconds deciding whether to look around or order first.
Definitely order first. The plants will still be there.

I hadn't actually intended to go here. I was on my way to somewhere else.
But... coffee? Plus plants? And everything is plant based?
Delicious cappuccinos and lattes.
'Pretty fly for a cacti.'
Drinkable gold.

This place is amazing. I had entirely too much caffeine.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

This place is amazing, such unique lattes I've never heard of!  I tried the superfood latte and not exaggerating it was the best thing I've ever tasted.  I'll definitely be coming back to try the Rose and Lavender lattes.  Amazing decor inside, very cozy and the staff was really nice.  Would for sure recommend.</review>

This place was aesthetically pleasing. I was really excited to try their blue latte based on pictures of other reviews. I ordered it with oat milk and even though it was really pretty to look at, taste wise it disappointed me. The taste was really bland and not worth my money. Beware this drink is non-caffeniated so that is also another strike for me. I would have rated this place higher if it wasn't for the owner's sarcasm. My order had already been placed and he approached us asking if we were from Pasadena etc. As we were talking I noticed they had stamp cards at my reach, which are usually offered to the customer when they make a purchase. I simply asked if he could stamp a card so I could come back and he replied very rude "No" in a very sassy way....I was shocked and replied why not? In my head I thought am I missing something? It took him a few seconds for him to say "I mean I could have refused you know?" Then he went on saying imagine if I had refused? And I understood he was probably joking but I don't understand why an owner of a new small business would joke around like that with new customers on their first interaction with the place....I could have definitely felt very offended and ask for my money back. Which I didn't but that's the reason I won't be returning to this place. Even aside from the whole owner to customer interaction, the taste of the latte is not worth me going back. I would much rather go to other coffee places like Jameson Brown  Coffee Roasters or Copa Vida their lattes are perfection.</text>

Went here last week and the woman that was working here was so rude and no personality. I even called ahead of time to see what matcha they used and she was even rude on the phone. The matcha is good quality but I will not be going here if I'm gonna get bad service.</review>

<Review>I am so happy that we found San Diego Wholesale Florist.  I purchased a wedding bouquet and bulk roses for my parent's 50th wedding vow renewal ceremony. The bouquet was absolutely gorgeous and brought tears to my mom's eyes the moment she saw it!  She wanted blush pink roses and the bouquet was everything she envisioned! When we picked up the flowers, the gentleman helped us choose additional flowers and even showed me how to make our own boutonniere's.  So helpful and friendly! Appreciate the wonderful customer service and assistance in making my mom's day!<//Review>< GmapID>

I visited this store today in hopes of using it for my daughter's wedding.  While the store was clean and the flowers looked nice, there was not one price on Anything.  If I wanted a price,  had to ask for every single item.  I wasn't greeted when I entered and was ignored the entire time I was there until I had waited around to pay.  I will never go back here; who wants to go shopping when there aren't prices on anything??????<//text>

Have used this florist a few times to deliver thank you flowers for our customers in Carlsbad. Always receive great feedback about the flowers. Friendly service,  great location (right off Palomar Airport rd), wide selection of beautiful flowers , affordable pricing & expert designers. Would highly recommend and will use any time we need flowers delivered in Carlsbad or into San Diego. PS: Their blue roses are amazing!</Review>

My goodness I wish I had known about this place earlier! I adore having fresh flowers in the house and wanted to buy wholesale so I could create numerous arrangements. I placed my order online for next day pickup - impressive I could do so with less than 24 hours notice. I had read all the positive reviews on Yelp which highlighted Vincent and they were right. Vincent was super friendly and easy to chat with. After being in the warehouse I noticed how beautiful the hydrangeas were and it was really easy to add to my order. Support a local business and give this place a try, you won't be sorry! Nowadays we could all use a little joy and there's nothing better than vibrant, fresh flowers to lift your spirits!</Review>

<review>I highly recommend San Diego whole sale florist! I originally went in to purchase just neutral pampas grass but they have such a variety of colors I ended up leaving with so much more. They also have a bunch of cute dried flower goodies as well. Vlad and his partner were also super helpful! Highly recommend them to anyone looking for any kind of floral arrangements!</review><rate>5< /rate>< Pics>

Great experience!!!  Staff was very personable and helpful. I am new to floral design and event planning and Vincent took the time to not only help me find the best florals for the event but also taught me some tips to floral arrangements. I could've gone to another closer wholesale florist for this event but because of their customer service before I even placed my order, I made the drive to Carlsbad.<//text>

AMAZING!!! The arrangement was full, fresh, and BEAUTIFUL!! My experience couldn’t have been any better. It was a last minute decision to get some flowers for my aunt so I just called and found out they closed in ten minutes BUT they assured me it was no problem! They asked me a few questions about what kind of arrangement (colors, vase, etc) and my budget and made a completely custom (and huge😍) arrangement for me in under 10 minutes! It was perfection! I would definitely recommend them for any kind of floral needs!!!💖 (wish I could figure out how to post a picture but it looks just as beautiful if not better than the ones on their website!)< /Text>

Who doesn’t love flowers!?! This is the BEST flower market I’ve ever been to. Stunning roses, exotic tropical flowers, orchids galore, dried flowers, etc. Vincent is exceptional. He’s knowledgeable and eager to help you find what you’re looking for. If you can’t find it, Marina or another fabulous designer can create a stunning arrangement for you. Flowers are such a lovely gift for any occasion and this place has an incredible selection and very fair prices.< /text>

Vincent went out of his way to make it a great experience by helping me off the clock with questions I had with a customized bouquet.  I was even in a time crunch and he was able to make the delivery on time.  1000% recommended.  This company will have my business forever.<//review>< pictures>

Best among the rest. I ordered their La Jolla bouquet but requested dahlias in lavender. ( dahlias are my wife's favorite flower) Not only did they customize the bouquet but they also delivered in Carlsbad within 2 hrs. Six days later the bouquet still looks fresh. Thumbs up< /review>

<Text>Massive thank you to these guys for helping me out with a same day delivery during Covid. I placed a sympathy order to Del Mar over the phone and requested a lavender/purple bouquet. We also requested a text image of the arrangement prior to the order going out (due to an embarrassing experience with 800flowers) Well .... they delivered and now I will never use national flower broker ever again. Thoroughly impressed with their service.< /Text><user_name>Hunter Hoestenbach< /user_name><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

This is actually Jenn and not Brad but I own a women's clothing boutique and needed a few pampas grass for the store. Not only did they exceed our expectations but the variety was gorgeous. Thank you from Wild at Heart Boutique.< /Text>

A bulk flower store that sells to public, actually answers their phone and even has their flowers listed online with prices and you can just add everything and pay online? This is an anomaly. Thank you so much! You earned yourself a customer. Looking forward to my flowers.
Fyi you have to buy $250+ online to get free shipping but their website may have a glitch.</review>

<text>They were wonderful. So very helpful as they took their time to explain my options on a blue bouquet. Delphinium is my mothers most favorite flower as she loves to garden. The price was fair ... The arrangement was impeccable and  the delivery was prompt. I couldn't be more pleased.< /text><gmap_id>0x80dbffae5b99fd5d:0xfaef85be857c8288< /gmap_id></record>

<review>I chose wholesale flowers because of the wedding channel and also it's close proximity to my home to be my florist for my wedding at the Crossings in Carlsbad and I'm extremely happy I did. They were the nicest and most affordable option for us and everything turned out so beautifully! I highly recommend them!!!</review><pics>None<//pics>< Time>

Yesterday was our 15th year anniversary and I decided to surprise my wife at work before dinner at Vintana. Her favorite flower is a peony and this was the only florist in north county who had this flower available and offered same day delivery. My wife was ecstatic when she brought the bouquet home. Count me in on Valentines day.<//Text>

Buying wholesale is the best!

- freshness & variety
- beautiful + creative arrangements
- can fit any price range
- large selection of flowers
- lasts for 1-2 weeks (she tucks buds in there that flower when other arrangements would be in the trash)</Review>

Thank you for excellent service. My first time ordering flowers from this wholesale Carlsbad florist. I always prefer supporting local business over FTD, 1800flowers etc.  Person who answered the phone was very friendly. Simple conversation of personal info as I selected a green cube arrangement of their website. Delivery time was spot on ... my wife works right off Carlsbad village dr and had the flowers within 2 hours. She was estatic and loved the flower arrangement. In conclusion a great place for all your flower delivery needs.</review>

<Text>Ordered an arrangement to be delivered to my girlfriends office around noon today, she had them by 1pm. They blow the doors off anything you'd get from a generic florist (i.e. 1-800-nonsense, FTD etc), they're a local shop so you're doing good there.

Can't beat this place with a stick, will be back for future orders.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80dbffae5b99fd5d:0xfaef85be857c8288< /GmapID></record>

My key was left in the other location on 10th and West of Lancaster, CA and it was sunday the guy who gave me truck from 10th West Location was not picking up my call. Later I went to J street Location and there was Steve guy. He was so good to help me and sent a person on sunday who make keys. That person came and opened truck with key code on my contract and helped me go on time for my flight from LAX. I really appreciate Steve who was super supportive even the truck was not rented from his location.
Really Grateful. Thank you so much.</Text>

<review>Was fair picking up but was ignored when dropping off. Was told to park and someone would be with me but no one ever came. Ended up taking the trailer off myself and going inside at which point they questioned me as if I was at fault somehow for not flagging them down again and again after I was already told someone would he with me.
Not a great way to treat a handicapped customer. They were more than happy to charge me full price and send me on my way. They could have at least asked if I needed an application since I did their job better then they did. Lol</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

She was professional, friendly and efficient.   She explained everything well and made the rental a breeze.  The truck was clean and functioned well.  When returning the vehicle,  I had the same experience with Peter.  The staff was great and the entire rental experience was awesome!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>I had an issue which I asked the manager to call me but she never did.  I rented online two unit storages and was told I had to buy two locks. But when I opened up my storages, management had complimentarily placed two free locks in my units.
So I needlessly paid for two locks.
As I went back the same day to get a refund on the two locks I bought, they refused to refund me.
Steve , an employee, was very rude and referred me to call the manager because she was not in the store. I called customer service but the manager never called me back.
This is a shady scam....beware.< /review>< pics>

It's a shame "zero stars" isn't an option. My experience with U-Haul Moving & Storage of West Lancaster has been the single most infuriating customer "service" interaction I have ever had. The story begins when my U-Box was moved here when there was not enough room in Pasadena, where it was supposed to be stored. When I tried to call up to U-Haul Moving & Storage of West Lancaster and arrange to get my box returned to me, I could never get through to anyone actually in Lancaster; I would inevitably wait on hold for quite some time and then get rerouted to a corporate customer service line. Day after day I was assured that someone would return my call; it didn't happen. Finally, after 9 days of calling every day, I did get through to someone actually in Lancaster and was told that out of county delivery of my box would mean a nearly $500 charge - even though I had never wanted my things to be stored up there in the first place! After TWENTY-FOUR more phone calls over the next three days with various customer service agents, someone gave me the cell phone number of Chad Farren, the president of U Haul of San Fernando, who immediately arranged for it to be delivered to me - free of charge, but thanks to the incompetence of the individuals at U-Haul Moving & Storage of West Lancaster, nearly two weeks after I had needed it delivered.

So, I got my things, but the nightmare doesn't end here! U-Haul Moving & Storage of West Lancaster has continued to charge me for a storage space at their facility despite my having retrieved my things a month ago. I called yesterday - after a long wait on hold, was rerouted to the corporate customer service line, per usual - spoke to two agents and their manager, who could find no record of my contract and had no idea why I was still being charged, but said they eventually got through to the manager of U-Haul Moving & Storage of West Lancaster (Vanessa Ruiz, I assume) and sorted it out. I got an email refunding the last charge, and I was assured the account was closed out for good and I wouldn't be charged again and this whole nightmare would be over.

No surprise, it was not over!! I woke up this morning to another email saying I was charged again (!!!) for a month of storage, in the same amount that was refunded yesterday! At this point, I wonder whether I should even bother to call for what is probably the 40th time and try to get this refunded, or if I should just eat my losses and cancel my credit card to prevent future charges.

TL;DR you're better off just throwing any belongings you would store there straight into a landfill and trying to find them later, because digging through burning trash to recover your things would probably be a more pleasant experience than trying to deal with U-Haul Moving & Storage of West Lancaster. And it'll be less expensive.<//Text>

Only one person working there no manager no 1 to answer real questions absolutely pointless to go that to this place I'm a business that wanted to have a trailer for a week at a time repeated contract unfortunately no 1 tip that knows anything about pricing or able to negotiate for weekly rates. And sound a much better price that westside rentals $200 for 7 days for the same trailer.  Go westside rentals.< /Review>

<text>So like would it kill these people to answer the phone?
Seriously they kept my elderly father here for 4 hours because they would  NOT let him rent the Truck without a 2nd phone number and couldn't be arsed to answer the dang phone. I called them like 6 times trying to get ahold of someone there.
He finally decided to use his insurance companies phone number so he could get the heck out of there.</text><Gmap_id>0x80c25b2663a5aa21:0xe4ebb82b91a6ecb8< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This is a great laundry, they have a lot of washer/dryer machines with different sizes. It is very convenient when you have a lot and little to wash. I like coming here because their customer service is excellent, especially Doris. She is always helping all customers being nice and friendly. I give her 100%.<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I have been coming here to wash for about 4 years but I can say that for the last year this laundry has been the best place I had come to the place is always always clean (Doris) is always cleaning and very helpful with any needs the clients. The only bad side is that I wish it could be open 24 hrs so we as customers can come as we need without worrying they will be close. I would definitely recommend this laundry mat<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>You have to buy one of their cards for $4, then if you add a $20 bill(must be a $20 bill) you'll get $2 credit. Although the sign says you get $22 credit, that's not true. It's clean, and they have great machines. When I called Brandi I was kinda mad I didn't get $22 like the sign says, she was so nice, had excellent customer service. The lady working was awesome.< /Review>< Date>

They charge you $4 just to get a laundry card then you still have to add money on there to wash the cheapest wash machine they have is $2 then they're doing construction so it's making all of your clothes harsh you have everyone putting all type of chemicals into the washing machines so that stuff gets all on your clothes it's just horrible your clothes come out all harsh</text>

In order to wash here you must purchase a card for 4 dollars, plus whatever money you need to wash. It must be exactly 4 dollars, and the dryers dont dry very good. The restrooms are clean, you need a quarter so make sure you get change if you know you'll be there a while. There are some vending machines, tables and chairs all the way to the left when you first enter. There is a door in that area that leads to the winchells next door. There is a little claw machine as well. Overall staff are attentive, and the place is clean. Just not the place for someone who only has a few bucks to dry.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) A few days ago I called and sent mail because when I add a balance to my card to wash, I do not add it, pay with a debit card and call and several days have passed and nothing has answered my calls except the emails.

It is clean but they are not responsible for anything ..

(Original)
Hace unos dias llame y envie correo ya que al agregar saldo a mi tarjeta para lavar no me lo agrego, pague con tarjeta de debito y llame y ya han pasado varios dias y nada que me contestan mis llamadas menos los correos..

Esta limpia pero no se hacen responsable de nada..<//review>

Excellent food and 5 star service

I special order my food
I'm disabled with service dogs for mobility
and it alters some normal food choices.. so per my request
I ask for normal menus items differently to cater to my disability
Sometimes this doesn't get handled correctly
And this Locations Manager Victor showed some above and beyond customer service skills in helping me correct my order..</text>

Employees were rude and acted like it was a major inconvenience to take my order and money. I asked for an extra hot mustard sauce and it was like prying a penny away from Mr Krabs. Food was decent but I won't go back to this location.<//text>

<Review>I ordered 6 bacon and cheese biscuits with 2 coffees,  $30. Very disappointing,  bacon was so thin that it tasted fake. They compensated with ALOT of egg.. (i thought thati liked McDonald's? ) maybe i should have gotten sausage..?<//Review>< pictures>

I'm a truck driver and am limited when it comes to eating while on the road because of the pandemic.
This location was able to tender to me by taking my order at the door.

Food is usually fresh and hot. They rarely get an order incorrect. My complaint is if you pick up a mobile order in drive thru after curbside closes and they're busy, your food will sit until vehicles ahead of you are taken care of. Food isn't hot then.<//Text>

<review>I think it's a widespread trend for fast food places to cut back on the condiments but this McDonald's goes so far as to not have ketchup near the drive through pickup window making it a production to get when requested. My theory is that it's to make customers feel guilty for the request. It's a trend that is truly irritating.<//review></record>

This is a typical McD's. However the building is brand new, replacing an old building down the street. Plenty of parking
Easy access to the freeway. Clean. Friendly staff. Good food. I often go there for breakfast and really enjoy the biscuits.< /text>

It took 5 minutes to get a coke with one car in front of me. Whatever happened to pull forward and wait for your special order. Then apparently they gave him the wrong food and they had to give it back and then they waited a while and then gave them some more food and when I pulled up they tried to give me a kid's meal instead of my Coke.</text>

Its McDonald's.  Kids that work there have no customer service.  Practically "say what you want?" And dont even look at you when handing you your order.  Like the dont care about the job or you and your order.< /Text>

It was fresh food. The restaurant needed some cleaning. They also don't have a good variety of items for Diabetics.</Review>

< Review>
This is a great McDonald's but I asked for my fries to be light salted and once I got my fries they were really salty I asked the manager to make me fresh French fries she couldn't even do that, that's so selfish telling me it's not that salty I made it a special order but it wasnt so I'm really disappointed at the manager there .<//Review>

My husband's a truck driver, tried to order breakfast before heading to unload. Was refused and told to go download they're app and order there. Thanks don't have time for that. Taking his order would have taken less time than telling him that.< /Text>

<review>The Deluxe breakfast is one of the best breakfast all round the desert please keep the the deluxe breakfast 24/7 on the menu,  I work 3 o'clock in the morning and I have to drive to different McDonald's to get my Deluxe breakfast because The problem is the scramble eggs in the morning they don't want to make So they say to the Deluxe breakfast not serve until regular breakfast time but all other breakfast items or 24/7< /review><Name>Roland Barnett< /Name>< time>

I ate here on 10/29/19 for lunch. My wife and kids all had burgers I had a McRib.  Just so happens the three that had burgers on this day are all sick throwing up following eating this meal. I called to let the manager know not even trying to get compensation and she told me we have to go to a clinic/hospital to get a test to prove it was their food. Yeah sure okay, no. This horrible female manager didn’t take ownership or even apologize.  I live down the street and will never eat at this McDonald’s again. I don’t need to prove anything I just know what I will and won’t do.</text>

<Text>Second time here for breakfast. Both times they force you to use the kiosk if you don’t want to wait in line all morning. Drive through is fine, but pay for an employee for the register like every other McDonald’s.

Really fancy. The manager came up to us and asked how the food was. Really modern looking place. McDonald's doesnt have a play yard for kids anymore to jump around in, they have computers/TV's. Oh how the world has changed< /Text>

It took McDonald's 15 minutes to serve us a sausage and biscuit the staff were all in the back playing around and not focusing on customers walking up the only person that was really focused on working with the young lady in the Drive-Thru< /text>

<Text>Extremely disappointed there was no child changing station in either bathroom. When you plant a McDonald's next to the freeway, you expect things. My dad's favorite coffee and a bathroom break for the family meant we planned this exit for a quick stop. The crew didn't think it was a big deal. No one even apologized. Just yes we don't have that. #NotFamilyFriendly #OneMoreReasonToStopComing #LostCustomer #Ridiculous #McDonalds< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>
