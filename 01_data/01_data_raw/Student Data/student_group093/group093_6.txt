My new go-to salon for all of my hair needs, whether it’s a quick, cute buzz & cut, picking up my essential hair products, or going blonde...this is your one-stop shop for sure! I went in for full blonde highlights today. I showed them photo examples of what I wanted and they nailed it EXACTLY! And the color is truly beautiful! Take a look at my pics for yourself. The Maxi Hair Salon staff listen, they are kind, they are affordable, and they are technically-proficient. I cannot emphasize enough how pleased I am with my results! So happy!! A million thanks, Maxi Hair Salon!!<//Review>

I went in with a lop-sided haircut from supercuts and came out with exactly what I wanted! Ellie is very kind and friendly and did such an amazing job. Couldn't recommend this place more.

<review>I stated growing long hair once I got to Berkeley because I couldn't find any barbers that I was satisfied with. Eventually longer hair just made me even more picky to decide where I wanted get it cut. However Ellie is super competent and over the past year she's done an amazing job whether it's long or short hair and has even made sure to always give me tips on how to style it!< /review><resp>None</resp><date>1557336054954<//date>< rating>

I went to Ellie for my eyebrows throughout my time as a Berkeley student, and she is amazing! She is extremely meticulous and always left my eyebrows perfectly shaped and just the right thickness. She plucks instead of threading or waxing, so there is minimal pain and your skin won't be irritated afterward. Ellie is also very warm and friendly, and her price is reasonable ($15). I will miss getting my eyebrows done at Maxi Hair Salon!< /review>

I went to this hair salon to have my hair done for an event, and they did a wonderful job. I asked for an intricately styled updo (showed a picture), and the final result (see uploaded picture) looked exactly as I wanted it. Very reasonably priced ($90) for a full hour of work. Would highly recommend.< /Review>

I’ve been to Several of the hairstylist here and they have always been consistent in giving me an amazing haircut. They are also super personable, and will provide you with an excellent service each time. I love coming here, it’s not over priced either and I think they give the students in the area a pretty good discount. Highly recommend them!!</Text>

<Text>I have been here twice and both times have been delightful. The place is clean and well-managed, and the stylists are professional, friendly and adept at their craft. I was really happy witha few of their specialty services, including a Deva cut for curly hair, and eyebrow threading. Normally, Deva cuts can run on the expensive side, but the stylists at Maxi salon do a professional job at a student-friendly price. I'm really happy with the service I got, and will definitely return!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I have been a regular for over 15 YEARS and I have referred many friends there over the years . I once referred a student of mine there who later moved to Scotland for her PHD but still makes a point of going to Maxi when she is visiting!  true story and I have many more like this! Anyone I send there becomes a regular regardless of age group!  Very high quality work!</Review>

I've been a satisfied customer of Maxi Hair Salon for many years and enjoyed not only my interactions with the staff but also observing the diversity of her clientele. I've heard everything from an in-depth conversation on the best shade of purple to grandmothers stating they need a great style for a hot date. They do a great job with men and women, I’m envious of some styles for males that just wouldn’t work on me (long past my 20’s, lol). The shop is clean and airy and foot traffic makes for good people watching while you’re in the chair. The online booking site is a breeze to use and shows you both availability and prices.< /Text>

I love this salon! We use to live in Berkeley and went there for over 20 years. Now that we moved to LA we still try to coordinate our trips so we can still get our hair and my eyebrows done there.  They are so good at what they do.  They do amzing job for my husband and my sons haircut as well as high lighting and cutting my difficult hair. Very reasonable prices as well. Highly recommended them!
If I could give more stars i would! :)<//text>

Been going on and off for over a year depending on where I lived. But as soon as I moved back to the bay area, I was looking forward to making an appointment with Ellie at Maxi Hair Salon. Ellie, Hannah and other staff have been super friendly and always enjoy seeing you coming in. Ellie remembers what kind of hair style you want and you always leave the place, looking forward to coming back. I really enjoy Maxi Hair salon.<//Text>

You have to watch out for non-English or bad English speaking businesses. On top of that you give them clear speaking instructions and later on when you complain about them giving the wrong haircut, they have this attitude of you  being wrong. Only the owner speaks good English. It's hard to find a good barber that speaks good English and good customer service!!<//Text>

Ellie is my favorite! She is a wizard who knows how to trim split ends along the length of the hair without taking too much off the bottom< /text>

Ive been coming here for 18yrs now. Im in the quality assurance field. Before I came to Maxi Hair, I used to go to L.A. every month for my haircut. Think about that for a second. Why would i come to a place for 18yrs if they didnt to A+ work especially when Im about quality of work? Price and quality of work is what matters; Maxi Hair has both.</Text>

I have been going to Maxi Hair Care since they opened back in the early 1990's when I a student at Cal.  While I no longer live in Berkeley, I still go miles out of my way to Maxi's to get my hair cut since they always do a great job.  I highly recommend them.< /text>

<Response>{'time': 1525015937297, 'text': 'Dear Mr. Alexander,\n\nMy name is Ellie and I’m the owner of Maxi Hair Salon. I’ve been working here since 1992 with my very skilled partner since then. \xa0After reopening the salon we were on a search of finding a third person whom was as qualified. \xa0The new person whom cut your hair presented herself with an outstanding resume and we thought we had found our match! Unfortunately that wasn’t the case and you had come in during her short time here. She is no longer with us. It is very unfortunate that you had such a bad experience. I am truly sorry! Also very unfortunate for us to get punished with a bad review. We work very hard to keep up a good reputation.\n\nBest,\nEllie/ owner\nMaxi Hair Salon'}</Response>< date>

<user>111652245851974044196</user><date>1542012526558<//date><text>If this were years ago when there was far less competition in the boba world, this place would probably get 4-5 stars easy but since the 626 (and beyond!) has been inundated with a tea shop on every other corner, the bar has been raised and places like Tea Station need to change to keep up.

Service and atmosphere are okay, nothing great. Drinks are- again- okay, not great. They lose a star for the fact that they do use syrups and creamers. I am not a fan of cheap ingredients and additives. I like that they do have a full kitchen and a solid food menu, which a lot of boba places lack.

The last time I was there, I simply ordered their Spicy Wontons. Twenty minutes pass by and nothing... I got the sneaky suspicion that the guy who took my order never actually put it in, so I flagged someone down and sure enough, I was right.

When it finally came out, it was hot and delicious, even though I wouldn't have minded it a tad bit spicier. They apologized when handing me the dish and when the check came for our table, I wasn't charged for my order. That was a proper customer service move on their part and I was pleasantly surprised as service can be bad enough to warrant a one-time visit only.

Thank you, Tea Station staff, for an otherwise flawless evening with my girls.</text><gmapID>0x80c2dab70d6dbffd:0xa68ad8e39d3fb9b2<//gmapID><Resp>None<//Resp>< pictures>

<review>Best boba tea in the plaza, hands down. Don’t be fooled in case it’s not as busy and “trendy” as the other places. We tried a few different places since there are so many nearby boba shops, but none of the other ones are connected to a real tea store and thus, as you would expect, have lower quality milk tea. 10/10 recommended.</review>< Pictures>

I thought it's just a tea house but they serve food too.
They have a lot of Taiwanese bento style food and when you order the bento , you can get free milk tea during the happy hour.< /review>

<Text>This place deserves zero star, although I can’t choose zero star. The boss was horrible and rude. I was overcharged and they refused to refund the difference. The boss was screaming, yelling and cussing at the customer.

<review>It's ok. Wasn't the best tea place I have been to. Service was off and you have to buy an item per person. Not a place you can go to and drink a cup of tea with a friend after lunch. Forces you to either 4 teas or snacks.  They don't educate some people about the tea and they don't seem to care. It's not really about tea culture.  Cool place to chill.  Super spacious and all. Has two bathrooms and a tea place next door to buy loose leaf tea. The bill took a while to get to us also. We had to request a second time since they forgot us. Was a few minutes of waiting. They also have some random table mats with advertisements. Kind of made the place a little less formal looking. When I think of tea I think of something refreshing and overall the experience was not. Should check them out though. My palette may be slightly different from others. I will say the chrysanthemum puer infusion tea was better than the dragon well green tea. Parking is difficult, but we walked over. The popcorn chicken was ok. Not so crunchy and the tofu was bland and super hot. Be careful when you bite into it.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>If you want to drink boba, this is one of the places to go! They have all kinds of drinks here that they can prepare for you. In my experience, they are all very flavorful and enjoyable! You can also adjust the sweetness of your drink, in case you prefer to lessen the sugar level.

In addition to drinks, they have a lot of food items you can order from - comfort food Taiwanese style! You know it's good!

This place also allows you and your friends to kick back and enjoy card games, board games, or just great conversations as a group.  Many also come here to study and read.

There's a more formal section for drinking and tasting tea, in case you are a tea connoisseur. True to their name, they have a wide selection of teas of varying quality you can choose from.   I usually just go with the milk or lavender milk tea + Boba with my budget. :)<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Like all Tea Station throughout SGV area, it's always relatively clean and neat.  This location is small and could get crowded easily, so be warn! But I do like this location because it is small! It has enough table outside and inside to meet up with a friend for a cup of hot tea, boba, or even HOT POT (seasonal).

I've added a picture of the menu, so take a look. When I walked into their location, every other table was chowing down on it. Yum! As for their quality of their drinks, it doesn't fail the Tea Station standard!

check 1 - location (small and quaint)
check 2 - quality tea and drinks (non-alcoholic)
check 3 -chilly outdoor seating area with a steamy hot pot!</review>

<Text>One of the top boba places in the SGV area.

Always consistent and very good. You can tell them how much ice or how sweet you want it which is perfect if you don't like your boba as sweet as me.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

The food is here VERY expensive. For example: the minced pork bowl (regular sized-bowl with 2 sides) here is $10.50 whereas, at Ten Ren the total is cutted in half.</Review>

You park in the plaza nearby. Good for fresh boba tea and you can hang out or play boardgames here as long as everyone buys a drink/ food item</Text>

<name>Glenn Zucman</name><Date>1486828737047</Date><Rate>4</Rate><text>This is a tricky review to write. I did like Tea Station, but it's also right next to Bake Code and Boba Avenue, so it's hard not to compare. To be fair, all 3 places are different. If you go, a quick peek in each will probably make it clear which place is for you.

Boba Ave is where all the cool Asian kids hang out. This might sound bitter, but I really don't mean it that way: if I were cool, or Asian, or young, I'm sure I'd be hanging out at Boba Ave, but since I'm none of the 3... eh... I might still go there, it's pretty cool, but IDK why I would when Bake Code is right next door. The music there is pretty loud. That might make it fun for you. Since I'm neither cool nor young, it was just loud for me. There was a girl across from me working on her laptop and wearing ear plugs!

Bake Code is home base for me. From the 1st moment I walked in the place I've just been in love with it. Over time I've liked it in different ways. At first it was more of a bakery where I bought a bunch of items to go. Lately it's more of a coffee-tea place where I get one item and some hot milk tea and hang out and work on the laptop. I'm sure Bake Code isn't as cool as Boba Avenue, but for me it's so much friendlier and warmer than Boba Ave or Tea Station. Bake Code definitely has the friendliest employees and their baked items are to die for.

So Tea Station is really fine, but with cool Boba Av and warm Bake Code right next door, I probably won't go to Tea Station again. Not that I wouldn't, just that the other places seem more likely. Interestingly, while the cool Asian kids like to hang out at Boba Ave, Tea Station seems to be the place where the old Asian men like to hang out and play cards. I don't mean to pigeon-hole Tea Station as an older place, I think there might have been young people there too.

Tea Station good, but Bake Code fantastic! And Bake Code is easily half the price of Tea Station, or less. And then you've also got Boba Avenue. Nice to have so many options in one little spot. Haha, with more places across the street! :P<//text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) I really like the fruit tea here. I suggest that all the drinks are half-sweet, and the half-sugar is sweet enough.

很喜欢这里的水果茶，建议所有的饮料都点半糖就好了，半糖已经够甜了< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The store has the habit of collecting money from customers, and has promised a refund for many times, and ultimately does not return, but also murderous. It is recommended that consumers pay attention later....

<Text>Niloo is amazing! I was long overdue for a haircut so I booked a last minute appointment with Niloo. She listened to all of my preferences and gave me recommendations since I wanted to have more volume in my long, straight hair. My hair now feels so healthy and bouncy, especially with the blowout after my cut. I will definitely be back for another trim along with blowouts for any special occasions post-COVID!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Text>Niloo was fantastic! She took time to help me figure out what exactly I want, gave me a great cut, and even styled my hair the way I haven't seen it in ages. I initially came in just to get rid of my super long pandemic hair but left feeling pampered and with a new amazing style.< /Text>< Pictures>

This is the best hair salon ever! Niloo is an artist, and the only hair stylist that can handle my hair cuts exactly the way I like it! She also cuts my wife’s hair and she is extremely satisfied!
My wife also does hair facial hair removal here with Nazee, and she loves the service!
Frida does my wife’s hair coloring and we can say she is the only person that delivers the same color my wife picks in the book!

The staff are super friendly and welcoming!
The store is extremely clean and well-maintained.
I would definitely recommend all of the above services to anyone living in the area!</text>

Stylist was friendly, but not pushy about products or services. She gave a great cut. I got an appointment day of, there were a couple of walk-ins while I was there. That may be because it was a slow day. I plan to go back.</review>

<Rate>3</Rate><text>I've gotten my hair cut here a few times. The first one was nice. The second time I went back in April, I really liked my haircut by Mariae. This time I booked with another person who was available and I'm very upset with how it turned out. My hair is supposed to be layered, but the right side has a large chunk cut in a straight line and it kind of looks like a mullet. I'm planning on going somewhere else next time. UPDATE: Niloo offered to fix it for free. It's nice that they care about customer satisfaction.<//text>< Pics>

I asked for a highlight to remove the brassiness in my blonde color and received the best highlight ever. I could not be happier with the color. I have received "cool" highlight only to look grey, but these we perfectly blond without yellow! Amazing work by Niloo. And, asked for small trim and received one. Will be back soon when I have courage to do the Brazilian Express!< /text>< response>

< review>
I got the worst haircut possible in this salon. Not sure how the stylist managed to deliver such a horrible haircut and do all the things that I clearly said I don’t want/like at the beginning. I waited three weeks for my hair to grow longer and went to another salon in the hope that they can fix the disasterous haircut I got in Evoke. Unfortunately, they said I have to wait longer as the damage is much worse than I thought.
I was never too worried to try a new hair salon as I knew my hair would grow long again anyways, but this stylist at Evoke made me realize how wrong I was. Still cannot believe the haircut I got here! I am really frustrated with the extra hour added to my morning’s ritual, trying to make my hair representable to be able to show up at work! At least now all my friends and colleagues know where not to go for a haircut!</review>

I got burned !!! Guys don’t go there mostly for hair coloring ! They literally burned me I started yelling because even my eyes were hurting for so much chemicals they added on me. They made my top hair look gold and bottom white blond color. Not professional at all!!!!</Text>

<text>I had a worst experience here! I booked an appointment with Frida and apparently one of her customer caused delays in her schedule for the rest of her appointments! She cut my hair in 10 min, did not take my inputs, did not show how my hair looked from the back! She asked if I wanted a “simple” blow dry and hinted her colleague to charge $20! Their website shows a different price, they charge more than the website. I don’t recommend this place, specially because they don’t care about you at all! I wish I could a 0 star, this place does not deserve a 1 Star too!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Nilo was awesome, thank you thank you thank you for my haircut! I went in with my thick wavy hair down to my shoulders, I asked for a short cut (and provided photos). Nilo talked me through what she was going to do and checked with me along the way to make sure I was happy with the lengths and cuts. I moved to the area almost a year ago, tried three different salons, and I finally found the hair stylist I'll be returning to. Thank you!< /Review>

<review>I was very happy with my experience here. My haircut was quick and professional, and everyone was very friendly. My two friends got their eyebrows threaded while I was getting my hair cut and they were also very happy with the whole shebang. 10/10 would salon again<//review></record></dataset><record>

Briana and I have had a great experience every time we have gone in...when the person we used to go was gone...we took a chance on trying someone else and all i can say is we are very happy..it is not a hit and miss place, everyone there knows what they are doing,  kind, friendly and welcoming. I like the fact that they use facial thread and how they take time with cutting your hair NOT CHOPPING IT :) Hightly recommend this place with very reasonable prices!!!!<//Review>

"This salon is stellar.  Frida was meticulous and she deeply cares about the happiness of her customers.  She is also warm and inviting, making you feel really comfortable during the whole experience.  The first time she did a great job restoring my hair to blonde after I had been neglectful and the outgrowth was outrageous.  This time, she took me from blonde to red with ease. It looks natural and came out exactly as I had hoped!"< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

They fixed it in less than a week and it came back good as new. They kept me in the loop with updates throughout the whole process. Even when they're busy, they're still super friendly and very helpful.<//review><user_id>116417015148001428164< /user_id></record>

If you own a Telsa all parts need to be ordered and received from so be prepared to wait much longer then normal auto body repairs. G&C staff were great kept me informed and completed the Car as soon as they received the parts. The parts took a very long time to come from Telsa. Telsa needs to get their act together especially for glass repair<//Review>

Do not take your car here. They do not care about you or your car. I took my car here to get a catalytic converter replaced. They put the wrong one (how? I don’t know) on and my car did not pass the smog. Instead of handling it with professionalism and remorse I got a handful of attitude and a sense of we’re doing you a favor contacting the muffler shop. Instead of a real solution, they suggested that I take my car to get the converter certified - basically me cleaning up their mess. In all of this, there was no we’re sorry this happened. The best they could say was “it looks like there might have been a mistake.”  No. There WAS a mistake. David at the shop, confined to blame the muffler shop which I understand that was where the error happened but I brought my car to G&C so regardless of where the error takes place it should be G&C’s responsibility to make it right with the customer. He also said, “We did everything to make sure your car was running again.” Sure, that’s appreciated but with the wrong parts? Now his efforts are counterproductive as I need to clean up his mess to make sure my car is okay to drive. David also at one point threatened to just write off our car as totaled “to make things easier”. What type of service is that? We, as the customer had NO part in this error and because we were slightly upset with what happened that was his unprofessional response. This is a huge inconvenience and there seemed to be no recognition around that. At this point, we were fed up and may have been assertive and upset on the phone with him. Instead of handling it with professionalism and empathy he hung up the phone on us.</text>

I brought in my car through the Allstate Good Hands preferred shop program. It was a relatively small job but G&C treated it professionally as if it was just as important as their much larger jobs. Jacob assisted me and he was great. Super nice, excellent follow up and attention to detail, and really went the extra mile when I asked him to look at an unrelated issue. Overall, great experience and the repairs were done very quickly and they look perfect. I would definitely recommend G&C to someone looking for a quality shop.< /text>

My car (my baby!) endured some heavy hitting after a car on the highway lost 5 metal pieces. I was heartbroken and ready to go to another shop that was closer to home but G&C took me immediately. They are such life savers. Please please please trust when I say BOOK WITH THEM! they had a new bumper on my car in a day and a half... dropped it off on Tuesday morning it was ready by Wednesday afternoon. I was able to pick it up on Thursday and leave my rental with them. So extremely thankful for the team here! My car was down bad but they brought me back!< /Text>

Kept me in the loop the whole time. They would call and text. Never disappointed me with customer service. We are so used to mediocre service these days I wasn’t expecting a lot. But each and everyone was polite and helpful.
The service was great. The car was ready in one day. And it looked perfect!!
I would definitely take my car there again.<//review>

<name>Benjamin Remington</name><Date>1605568082602< /Date><Rating>3<//Rating><Review>After they inspected my car and prepared and submitted an estimate for my insurance, I brought the car down and left it for a week.  I heard nothing from G&C until my insurance called me to say they wouldn't work on the car because they didn't know what kind of paint was on it. I called to ask if they didn't just strip the car down to the metal for a repaint and they said they didn't.  This was news to me. Evidently there's some sort of sealer they apply over the old paint once they've roughed it up a bit. So... I went down to get my car, told them I'd be there in about a half hour. Got there and stood around outside for about a half hour while they shuffled cars to get mine out.  Seems like they could have stayed that process when i called. The whole thing was a huge, needless waste of my time from start to finish. I appreciate a commitment to quality work that they feel comfortable warrantying, but their estimate  process clearly needs a revamp. I wasn't impressed by how they handled the whole situation and I certainly wouldn't choose to work with them again.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>TESLA OWNERS DO NOT GO HERE!! I dropped off my Model 3 for body work since the insurance company recommended it and they set up everything here. I had my rear door replaced and rear panel worked on, but due to that the drivers seatbelt hinge was misaligned (annoying that I have to go back, but not a huge deal). The reason I am rating it low is because they left marks on my seats and left a few tools in my car. I came in the next day for them to work on these issues and waited another 45min. I feel like they should’ve done a thorough job the first time (especially since I had a rental) instead of rushing and causing more issues and taking more of my time up. They should also ALWAYS charge the car.

Jacob, was very communicative during the original repair. The rear door and quarter panel also seem fine, but I’m still giving this a low rating due to the issues to my seatbelt, interior, not charging the vehicle, and taking more of my time when the job should’ve been completed correctly the first time.

I had a major front-end car collision and GC shop was recommended by my insurance company. The people were friendly there especially Jacob. He had kept good communication by answering all of my questions also providing updates at least once or twice a week via call or text to ensure my car was under good hands.  It has been three days now since I got my back. Everything seem to ok so far.  I thank everyone in GC shop for taking good care of my car. I would definitely recommend my friends or family. 🙂🙂</Text>

The folks at G and C are great. I needed front end work on my truck after an accident and spoke to around  eight shops before choosing them. I wanted a heavy duty bumper installed but most of the shops would only rebuild to the stock specs. Anthony looked at the installation instructions and agreed to do it at minimal extra charge. He kept me updated on the progress, coordinated with the car rental company for pick up and drop off and got everything done in one week as promised. I highly recommend this shop to anyone in need.< /text>

G&C Auto Body Berkeley is a great repair facility with an amassing team, who did a great job of restoring my car after it has been vandalized!
I had a privilege to work with Service Writer, Jacob Francis, who's professionalism is a top natch. He is very knowledgeable,
set accurate expectations about the length of the process in the beginning,  always kept me informed and did everything he can in coordinating parts ordering and repairs to get my vehicle fixed and back to me in reasonable time.< /review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>So these people are really incompetent. I read the other reviews and I had high hopes for them. But they disappointed me big time. My car i brought it to them the last week in Oct and my insurance had sent them an estimate already. G & C now said they need the ins. to send them the assignment to them. I said ok but they can go ahead and order the part for my car so that when my insurance sends them the assignment, the part will be here and no time will be wasted to fix my car. I also told them that if money is the issue, then i can pay for it as the insurance have already sent me payment of the initial estimate keeping in mind G & C has the same estimate. They refused to order it. Time went by and the insurance finally sent them the assignment on monday  Nov 16th and they still refused to order the part nor call me to let me know they received it. It was sitting there with them all week and now today is the 19th. I had to call them to follow up and find out that they didn't get the process moving. The assignment that they were waiting for was sitting with them all week and they did nothing. Total incompetence if you ask me. Now they are saying they can't get to my car till after the holidays in december. So I have to wait because they dropped the ball essentially. You would think that they will make efforts to get to my car since they dropped the ball here, but nope, they dont care. I wonder if I wasn't African maybe they would have treated me differently. Will never use them again and this is a caution to others. If you are going thru insurance their customer service is just horrible. But if you are fixing it by yourself, then maybe their service is better, who knows.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Great Customer Service. My estimator was Anthony and he was very friendly and always updating me of my vehicle's repair. Couldn't have taken my car to a better shop. Highly recommended.< /text>

The guys working here go above and beyond to make sure you receive excellent service. They are very professional, they did an excellent job working on my vehicle, they kept me informed along the whole process and answered all my questions. A friend recommended them to me, and I am passing this on. Top-notch service. I am glad I took my vehicle to this shop.<//review>

<text>I brought me 2017 VW Jetta for hood and grill repairs.  Not only did they do a excellent job, they finished the job in a couple of days. As soon as they got the parts ordered. Next day it was done . My Jetta looks like it was never in an accident at all. They even clean and detailed the car......I would recommended it for my family friends and anyone in need of good auto repair.</text>< Pictures>

My car was vandalized during the Covid 19 pandemic. The stay in place order and social distancing made getting it repaired very challenging. The folks at G & C Auto Body repaired my car quickly and safely, staying in touch the entire time with any changes that occurred. I was back on the road in no time. Thanks for everything G & C.</review>

746 Condos in this association.  Plentiful pools scattered all over the property.  Great food and beverages with Happy Hour, Taco Tuesday, Lunch and Dinner at the Clubhouse (in season) and the year round Grille which is open for breakfast and lunch daily.  Fitness center, game nights, shows....not a 55+ property, there's something for everyone!<//review>

First time here today. I ordered a breakfast croissant, a breakfast bagel, a blueberry glaze, and a red velvet glaze. Got home the breakfast bagel was cold. Threw it out. Looked in the bag there were two blueberry glaze donuts. I ordered 4 things and 2 of them were messed up. They were nice though. And the croissant was good.< /text>

Good coffee and breakfast sandwiches! Owners are nice and the staff is very helpful. Plenty of donut shops in the area but I prefer Homestyle.< /Review>

<Review>My review isn't about their donuts or pastries but rather about the way they go about resolving customer disputes.

I stopped here earlier today to cash in a winning lottery ticket.  Attached on top of the ticket was a verification slip, which was stapled by an official at the lottery field office about two miles away.

I was helped by an Asian woman,Susan (?), who appeared confused and initially declined to cash the ticket. She wasn't mean but she didn't exactly make me feel welcome. When she hesitated, I politely asked for the ticket back and said I would go the liquor store a few doors down.

Instead of returning the ticket, she finally read the verification slip out loud: "Retailer pay prize and give exchange ticket to customer....keep original ticket..."

I explained to her that I'd just gotten the ticket verified at the lottery field office and that she was a lottery "retailer".  And as a retailer she should be able to cash the ticket unless the store didn't have the money.

After confirming the ticket amount in the lottery terminal, Susan agreed to give me the cash. Instead I told her that I would be "re-investing" all of the money in additional tickets. Once she tallied all my ticket purchases, she said that I owed her $65 dollars. "What?" While I didn't dispute that fact that I owed her, I disputed that it was $65. What followed next was several minutes of back and forth exchanges, with her insisting that she was right.

Feeling frustrated and that arguing in front of waiting customers wasn't going to help, I asked for the tickets and receipt and left. I wanted to beat traffic but I know now that leaving the store without insisting on a itemized calculation was a BIG mistake.

Before getting home (near LAX), I used my phone calculator to check the receipt. I even took the tickets and receipt to a neighborhood  lottery retailer and explained my situation. He agreed with my calculations: that I owed Homestyle $37, not 65.

He said that the $28 difference was likely caused because Susan didn't clear the lottery terminal before adding my ticket purchases.  The receipt showed I owed $65 because there was $28 balance from a previous purchase.

I don't know if that's true but calling the store an hour after I left proved fruitless. At first, Susan claimed she didn't remember me or our transaction.  Once she did remember, she basically said she couldn't help me because I left the store before resolving the matter.  She was never rude but made it clear that she wasn't about reconcile the matter over the phone. I told I could return to the store any day but today. She finally ended the call by taking my number and agreeing to have the store manager contact me. He never  did. And I won't chase down $28.

Their donuts might be good but I'll never know since I won't be back.  My strong advice to anyone patronizing this place would be to always count your change, always get a receipt, and never leave the store  before reconciling any disputes.</Review>< Name>

< Review>
I got an ice cream out of here and it was suppose to be strawberry, kinda tasted like it but whatever its not Dryers or the other brands. I put in the freezer and would eat it later....four hours later I go get it and why has grease, lard, or shortening seperated from that supposed ice cream? It was gross, looked like gooey yellow slime. I'll never buy that mess again imagine what it does inside the body?< /Review>

<text>I have worked @ WISG for 17yrs as the receptionist. They are an awesome company to work for & I love my job.

Thanks for the kinds words. We appreciate you, Dan!'}</Response><text>As one approaches age 65, the choices for Medicare coverage seem daunting! But Krista Norris walked me through this process, step by step, showed me options, highlighted differences in plans, and helped me choose a Medicare plan that is just right for me. Krista is knowledgeable and communicates with excellence, which made my whole experience choosing my plans much easier. I'm confident with the results - and amazed how these insurance plans together are much less costly than the health insurance plan I've had till I reached Medicare age!</text>< rate>

I don’t even know where to begin with how impressed and so grateful I am for the entire Health Department. They made what would have been a very confusing and difficult transition for me an easy one.  Very quick and prompt to get back to me with any questions and broke down things to me so I could really feel great about the insurance plan I was getting into. I would HIGHLY recommend using WIS & G Insurance Agency. Thank you again for all your support, hard work, and kindness!< /Review>

Mandy, from day one, has been exceptional.
She walked me through what I might need, would need and did so in a professional manner.
No matter how many questions I bombarded her with ( and there were many) she always had the answer and was timely in her response. Professional, personable and a problem solver, Mandy is the best.< /Review>

<review>I recently received in the mail my house insurance for our lake home in Groveland.  The notice gave me choices on whether to pay monthly, or one time.  I called Winton-Ireland my agency to arrange the payment and Heidi who handles my insurance arranged over the phone to set up the payment without any further action on my part.  I so appreciate her prompt, efficient  service and her friendly personality.  I've been with Winton-Ireland for close to 20 years.

It is such a pleasure working with Winton-Ireland, Strom & Green Insurance Agency. The staff are extremely knowledgable, helpful, and very easy to work with. My organization, the Mariposa County Arts Council, produces and presents major performances and festivals, curates traveling exhibitions, and provides cultural events and art classes all over Mariposa County and the staff and Winton-Ireland, Strom, & Green always work with us to make sure we understand our coverage and each event is properly insured. I can't say enough good things about Winton-Ireland, Strom & Green.< /Review>

The fish is very fresh.  And the service is good.  Sushi chefs are very skillful at the art of sushi.

Really, you will be fully satisfied with any sashimi cut.  There is always a nice variety.  Yellowtail, mackerel, salmon...oh and the eel, sooo good.< /text>

<Text>Great atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff and a lively group of sushi chefs at the bar. This restaurant can certainly double as a hangout spot for food and drinks as much as it can be a dine out spot for a great dinner experience. Everything I have had has been great thus far. Nicely priced as well; not just for special occasions for sure! A great accidental find on my part; don’t you just love when that happens!?</Text><GmapID>0x80dd30252c82a7d3:0xa9a86d7f20494f2d<//GmapID>< Rating>

I go to this special place once a month since I like the  special atmosphere that is outline this place. The personel is awfuly attentive and skilfull. The service is impressively quick. Needless to say, the food they prepare is first-rate. I visited more than once and I was always joyful. The expense is reasobable. I highly recommend this place to to everybody.< /review>

<review>This place is horrible. Worst restaurant I’ve ever experienced. The server was rude. I had hair in my food and I told the waiter about it. They aren’t even sanitizing the tables. Stay away !!!</review>< pics>

Best sushi spot in Long Beach. Food and drink are fantastic and the staff is great too. A local spot you have to visit if you're looking for good sushi.<//text>

<review>First time at Kihon for dinner date, ordered almost completely off the specials menu which was extensive. Fish was great and fresh, staff was friendly and nice but at times a little slow with bringing out orders and the check otherwise would have been five stars. Prices are fair, we will be giving it another shot looking forward to adding the fifth star.</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Kihon is my new favorite sushi in Long Beach. The quality and flavor of the fish is incredible. Chef Erwin set me up with an omakase experience that was perfectly tailored to what I wanted without having to tell him. The service was friendly and fast, but not rushed. The fish tasted very fresh and the seasoning was spot on. I highly recommend dining here. I'll be back soon Erwin. Thank you!</review>

<date>1564890059022<//date><Rating>2<//Rating><review>Very disappointed, my daughter and I have been here many times and find the food excellent.  Tonight my wife and young son came here promptly at their 5pm open planning to get in and out before the dinner rush.  There was one couple in the restaurant, sitting at the sushi bar.  The owner came to seat us and insisted we take a table for two.  When we asked if we could sit at a table for four, he refused (there were three of us, an our son does eat plenty of veggie sushi, noodles, etc. When we asked where we should seat our son, who was in his carrier just waking up from a nap, the owner insisted that we put place him on the floor in the primary walkway between tables, near the entrance of the restaurant. We were totally blown away.  I’ve been here many times with my ten year old daughter and there have always been families in enjoying Kihon.  Not that it matters, but we always leave a 20-25% gratuity and have really enjoyed patronizing this establishment for many years. I wish I could chalk this up to a bad night, but what we experienced was completely unacceptable.  Nobody should be treated like this regardless of being a frequent customer or not.  Seriously, all we wanted was a table in an all but empty restaurant, that would accommodate our party of three – unfortunately for reasons that were only obvious to the owner, and perhaps the two individuals at the sushi bar this was not possible, and our young son was only invited to sit on the floor in an area that could easily become high traffic by the time we finished our dinner.  With so many great sushi restaurants in Long Beach, avoid this one and spend your money at a more service oriented establishment. We won’t be back.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Always fresh and never frozen like so many other restaurants. We exclusively eat sashimi so no hiding behind fancy roll ingredients. The staff is great. The Sushi Chefs are traditional and expert. If you ask them to make something special they always have a surprise for you. There can quite a wait at times which only demonstrates how well received this restaurant is in the community. The owner (also a sushi chef) Erwin is an honest hardworking restauranteur and with sushi chefs the likes of Peter and Kogi-san you are in for culinary delight. Ask them to smoke some halibut sashimi with Japanese mustard for you! Try going non prime times, even the best can fall short when “in the weeds”!<//Text>< rating>

<Time>1536465811900< /Time><Review>Fish was fresh and food was good - everything else was sub-par and kinda ruined the experience.

Pricing was on-par with most decent sushi places ( $13-15 per fancy roll)

Pros:
- food was good quality
- they did have gluten-free options and tamari sauce (gluten free soy sauce)
- hot green tea was not overly smoky
- had a full beer and wine list (not just sake and Japanese beers), which is a nice upgrade
- on-site free parking (it's in a strip mall)

Cons:
- atmosphere sucked - too loud to hear your date (and nearly everyone was there on a date) - we ended up yelljng at each other and mishearing each other all night.
- not really any "best seats" in the house- it's one fairly small-sized room. I kept getting bumped by wait staff on their way to other tables.
- my food (1 roll) came out at least 15 min. Before my date's sashimi plate ... weird. Made for an awkward dinner<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_RkIqCK_09TatK6gs05qB-Givq9bMYQw8CSkG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

My college-age son and I are glad we stopped here during a vacation. This Japanese restaurant is located on Naples Island in Long Beach, so we enjoyed a stroll before and after dinner. We experimented with dishes that were new to us: a Shrimp Tampura Roll and Salmon Nigiri. Delectable! We rounded it out with an appetizer of edamame and a glass of hot sake. We hope to return on our next visit to Long Beach.< /review>

<review>I always love coming back to this place. They're incredibly friendly and they know their craft. When I'm missing Japan, this is one of my go-tos. Sure it's not a perfect standin, but the ramen broth is fantastic and it's the only place I know of that serves Black Sea Bream (listen to their instructions, eat it how they serve it to you.)

If the food doesn't catch you, the atmosphere will. Happy eating.</review><rating>5</rating>< time>

This spot is super busy in the evening. Waited about 30 min+ for a table 6. Ramen was ok as the broth didn't offer much umami and layered flavors iv come to expect from ramen. But every place does their different so I still like to try them all. The sushi is just sushi, nothing extraordinary as sushi has been saturated now and they all taste the same to me.<//text>

Excellent quality, fun atmosphere without being too much, as well as great customer service.

The I've tried almost the whole menu at this point, but my go to is definitely yellowtail sashimi, it is melt in your mouth amazing...and I highly recommend the sakè flight to pair with it!</Text>

Best sushi place! Great service! Was referred to this place and now it's my favorite sushi spot. I'll usually drive an hour just to eat here, but it's worth it!

Seriously, it's the best sushi spot---EVER!!!

My boyfriend and I have tried other places because of timing issues (our work schedule) but we have ALWAYS been so disappointed.  We are so glad to be moving closer to our favorite sushi spot!!!! Thank you Erwin for making your restaurant a special place and for taking so much pride in your seafood selection and for having such a great environment!!!<//review>

Good place. Shared the garlic edamame and had a California roll while my friend had the miso soup and a crunchy roll, which were all good. Prices were reasonable and the staff was friendly and nice.</Text>

Seriously, as good a Japanese food experience as I've ever had and I lived in Japan. A level food, A+ service. The spicy miso ramen at medium heat is almost perfect. Good heat , great flavor. Sushi was really good as well. But dat tho. Simply amazing.< /Review>

<text>Now this place is something special that i hold near and dear to my heart...I started coming here not long ago but instantly knew that i had come to the right place when i met chefs Peter and Ken. These guys are the absolute business, they know what they are doing 100% and can make sure you have an excellent sushi experience. All of the fish is incredibly fresh and prepared the way it should be....ive never had a bad piece of sushi i didnt like from here, as well, the sushi doesnt need sauce, its made the way it should be. and dont forget about that rice tho!! Omg...a little hint of sweet and salt, and it wont fall apart on you when you pick i up.
The Ramen here is also very good...dont sleep on it.

The crew is very attentive to your needs and are always lurking to see if you need anything, but It does get packed here on the weekends and late nights so don't be surprised when you're getting the same attention your wife or girlfriend gives you at home... don't be shy, give em a holler and they will be right there and take care of your needs.

I could go on for days about this place but its time you be the judge.

10/10 always gonna be a favorite of mine.<//text></record>

<Text>Finally! A solid sushi spot in the city of Long Beach!

A friend recommended Kihon for dinner and I am so happy he did!
The two of us dined here on a Tuesday and it was fantastic! It was quite busy for a Tuesday night. We sat at the sushi bar and was well taken care of by Chef Peter.

Here's what we had:

Smoked octopus carpaccio
Jumbo scallop with kiwi:
Black cod
Golden eye snapper, sea bream, and amberjack nigiri
tuna sashimi
braised short ribs
soft shell crab

The highlights were the nigiris. The fish were delicate and SO fresh. I love that Chef Peter explained how each piece should be eaten. I'm still thinking of the Golden eye snapper and sea bream! The smoked octopus carpaccio is a must get. I love the presentation and there were just perfect amount of lemon oil and yuzu pepper on each bite. The jumbo scallop with kiwi was amazing! Didn't know kiwi worked well with raw seafood! Another hit was the black cod! The cod is marinated in miso for 36 hours and then grilled to perfection! This hot dish was divine!

I must say that Kihon is THE best sushi restaurant in Long Beach! They've been opened for 10 months and I can tell you they aren't going anywhere.

They're currently opened only for dinner but I hear they plan on opening for lunch sometime in the Summer.

Great spot for a delicious breakfast burrito. Fresh and hot food served here. The employees are very friendly. I got the ham breakfast burrito without beans, I added guac and sour cream. Second visit this week for a breakfast burrito. They are big and will hold you over until dinner. Great value.<//review>

My first time there - the most authentic Mexican Food in the area!  And I am picky.  Chile Verde and Carne Asada was excellent. Big street tacos as well!</text>

<rate>5</rate><review>Great little deli.  Fast service and if you don't see what you want on the menu, ask and they will probably make it for you.  The ladies are wonderful cooks and work really hard.  Very clean and it opens early.  The bakery items are fresh and I have seen them loading up at the store on Adams Street fresh out of the oven and take them over.   It is one of a few places where my order always comes out correctly.  I have also noticed that they have finally added a tip can by the order counter so please, everyone, leave these wonderful ladies a tip when you order your food, they work so hard at every job.</review>< Pics>

Service is great. They have most of what I need. I'm only giving them four stars because some of the candy I bought were expired, I'm talking about 5 months expired. I did notify the cashier the next time I went. Didn't get a refund or candy but at least she removed them.< /Text>

< Review>
I got food poisoning from here. it lasted 2 weeks and I was in the hospital 2x for hydration issues. the bacteria I got from this food caused my stomach to swell in pain. I need to find a lawyer to sue this place. the food was not worth this pain. I've had cleaner and better food at a food truck. avoid this place if it's still in business . sick<//Review>

Chicken was the best meat out of asada, al pastor, and pollo tacos. Service was good, but they had a lot of orders to fill so it took a decent amount of time to get the food. Overall good food, and good service< /review>

(Translated by Google) We bought some bread last night for dinner with a coffee. Unfortunately no bread had no savor as in other occasions we wanted to call to just say that the bread was not as in other occasions I hung up the phone did not want credit just let know to buy Rico bread to the future but I think with this answer I will think about it before returning

<Text>I was referred to this business by my Dentist. I visited them for tooth extraction and bone grafting.  The staff and Doctors were very courteous and nice with me.  The procedure was completed in a short period. Its been 4 days since then and I am feeling fine and no issues.  I will be going to them again in 2 weeks for check up and again for tooth implant in 3 months.  I will definitely recommend them to my friends.</Text></record>

<Text>A tooth implant is nasty, no way around that. Mountain View Oral Surgery made it as positive as they could. They were ready when I arrived, explained the process and post-procedure care. Everything was clean and COVID protocols were followed.  They were professional and friendly and communicated clearly. The prescriptions were submitted immediately to my pharmacy. I felt calm and I trusted their competence. All around I can’t think of anything they could have done better.< /Text>< pictures>

These dental procedures are quite intimidating, however Dr Sohoni walked me through the process and explained the pros and cons which was reassuring. I had one procedure done during COVID and it couldn't have gone any smoother, all protocols were followed well.The office staff members are pleasant as well.< /text>< date>

Dr. Nijhawan and his team are very nice. I went in with pain and was scheduled for surgery the next week. Before going to MTV Oral Surgery, I went to 2 other offices and was quoted thousands of dollars for my wisdom teeth extractions. Here, there front office staff found out that I was actually double covered with insurance and saved me a lot of money. I was definitely grateful to them for that and for the overall great experience. Although I wasn’t exactly excited that I needed surgery, I’m glad it was at the hands of Dr. Nijhawan and his assistant. They made me feel very comfortable and safe in their hands. I’ve already referred a family member to them.</text>

<text>The staff were really nice. I was nervous going in and taking out all 4 of my wisdom teeth, but they made me feel comfortable. They were very transparent about the procedure and reassured me that I wouldn't feel any pain during the procedure. This was my first surgery ever! Overall this has been a great experience.< /text>< Pics>

The professional yet friendly atmosphere of this institution - the staff, the doctors - everyone included is exemplary. Though we have a pretty screwed up Medical System in the States. If anyone one reading this can recall the good old days of "Family Practice" down the street (I do as I am from India - originally) , then you will relate to what I have experienced for now over a couple of decades !< /Text>

<review>Dr Sohoni is an amazing Doctor beyond words , many years ago he treated my dad ,he was wonderful I have heard about him from many of my friends. His hands has magic in them , I had 3 wisdom tooth removal surgery , 2 of them were sitting on the nerves, but after the surgery I had the normal pain of a tooth removal nothing beyond that.
From walk in to walk out I was so at ease I have no memory of discomfort ( I was stressed before the surgery ) but I think I should not have been as was in such able hands!! I would recommend him to everyone I know. Thank you 🙏🏻<//review>< userid>

I had all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed at Mountain View Oral Surgery. The process, from consultation to surgery, was quick and straight forward. I had a chance to interact with both doctors, and both were very knowledgeable and informative about my condition and what can be done. The rest of the team acted very fast, and overall I was impressed by everything involved in the process. I would highly recommend this location if you were to have your wisdom teeth removed.< /text>

I needed an emergency tooth extraction when my tooth cracked during a dental procedure. MVOS worked me within an hour for the extraction. The staff and the surgeon were kind and professional. They explained the process clearly. The surgeon gave me 3 option for long term issue of what to do with the hole. They explained pros/cons and costs of each option. I've chosen to go with getting an implant. It wasn't fun having a tooth removed and implant material embedded, but they made it as good as it good be. I'm healing well with no complications or problems.  Hopefully, I don't need this done again, but if I do, I will go back to them.< /review>

I was referred to Mountain View Oral Surgery by my dentist, was bit unsure visiting Oral surgeon (my first time). But, Dr. Nijhawan and his staff were super professional and patient while explaining extraction and grafting process. Everything wrapped up as per plan. I would highly recommend Dr. Nijhawan to anyone seeking advanced oral care needs.< /Text>

<Review>This review is for Dr Sohoni and his staff from my experience back in August 2016.
I had all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed by him in a very professional, quick and painless manner. Since two of these teeth were hinging on a nerve, there was a slight complicatiom later which was tended to by Dr Sohoni with no wait/delay.
Would highly recommend him to anybody with dental surgery needs.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

I cannot thank the staff and the surgeons enough for the outstanding service they gave me. I thought I was only going to have a consultation regarding my matter, but it turned out more than that. Had to get my tooth extracted out immediately on the day of. The staff knew what they were doing and gave me the best of care, especially how nervous I was making a quick decision. It went by smoothly and quickly. Here I am now one day after feeling better than ever!< /Text>

I went to the office assuming, they are in my insurance network. However they quoted me charges which were exorbitantly high and when I enquired, they said they are not in my plan. I came back without getting the procedure done. I came home and checked insurance website, which showed Dr Sohoni is in fact in my plan. I called the office back and they told me, insurance says them otherwise. Well, I called the insurance myself and they also told me, doctor is not in the plan. Then I asked insurance, how am I supposed to know which doctor is in my plan and which one is not. The insurance rep checked further and found that the doctor is in fact in my plan.
The next day morning, I called doctor's office and told them the same thing. I requested them twice if they can call the insurance again but they wouldn't agree. They offered me 2 choices. One, they can get pre-authorization which would take 4-6 weeks. Knowing clearly that I have an urgent extraction needed, not sure why will they even offer this. Second choice was, I agree to pay whatever they ask for (~2.5 times the regular billing) and if insurance pays them as I am saying, they'll reimburse me. I don't understand how can someone ask a patient to pay randomly like this. All I wanted was, if they could call the insurance and confirm about my plan again and tell me appropriate pricing.
I don't understand why does the office staff behave as if they are the "super rich" doctors themselves and couple hundreds of dollars here & there makes them no difference.
In the end, doctor is losing a patient and patient is getting hassled.

====

Following up to the response below from the owner. I clearly requested the billing staff twice if they can call the insurance as I believed insurance would give correct information now.
The exact closing reply from them was : "I am not going to call the insurance the third time, if that's what you are asking".
I was told, I have been given 2 options (either wait 4-6 weeks or pay upfront and get reimbursed later if insurance works).
Sorry, you are not the only doctor in the Bay Area. I guess, your staff thinks, I am not the only patient either.<//text>

I have been served at this location and by pretty much the same staff for now over 15 years ! I live their friendly attitude, and efficiency att which they operate .... there is never any confusion ..... the reason I have continued here is because they have not lost out on the human touch - from Staff to the Doctors to the surgeons</Text>

Awesome staff and Awesome Dentist. When it comes to dental work, I am easily scared. And this was my first time to get bone graft and implant procedure - so I was terrified! The staff was really really (yes I meant to write it twice) nice and patient. Appointments are given and taken in on a timely basis. They always were able to give me appointment to suit my schedule, without pushing out weeks ahead. They always called me the day after my procedure to ensure everything was fine and if there was any pain. I don't remember any of my other service providers doing a follow up call and certainly none of my doctors. Above all, the procedures were pain-free (literally!) and very quick. Dr. Sohoni is extremely professional, explains everything very well. His staff supports him very well. This review is based on 3+ visits and I see a great pattern - hence I decided to write it up.<//Text>

Dr. Sohoni is an exceptional oral surgeon- very capable indeed.

The facility is doing an excellent job in cleaning counters, sanitizing, temp checks, everyone wearing masks and hand sanitizer everywhere. Very reassuring</Review>

To sum up Dr. Sumit Nijhawan in one sentence, I would say, he is extremely caring, compassionate, confident, knowledgeable, and personable. I needed his expert opinion in interpretation of my jaw X-rays. He was very prompt in reviewing the digital images and got back to me right away with a confident answer which put my mind at ease. He is very humble with great communication skills. Thank you Dr. Sumit for being so helpful. Please keep serving the humanity with your skills and smiles!!</Text>

I have visited Dr Sharad Sohoni twice for my wisdom tooth extraction and I couldn’t be happier with the experience. He is extremely professional and exceptionally skilled in his expertise. I was bit nervous about the whole thing to begin with but he eased me with his friendly talks and calm nature. His staff is super friendly and cooperative. They handle and prepare the patients too well for the surgery. Big shoutout to all of them. I would definitely refer him to all my friends and also to anyone looking for a great dental surgery doctor.< /review>

<text>Had all 4 of my wisdom teeth extracted recently. Dr. Sohoni's work was amazing! I felt no pain during the procedure and the healing process was great. Cheeks did not swell up like others often do and did not need to use heavy pain killers post-op as pain was bearable. Dr. Sohoni and the entire staff were super friendly and helped me through the entire process. They managed to make having your teeth extracted be a lovely experience. Would highly recommend!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808fb6ce78d8174b:0x7b47aad9ea8c54e0</gmapID></record>

Extremely proficient in his job. Very courteous and to the point. Not greedy like most in this area. Highly recommend him. I and my wife got our wisdom teeth extracted here. No pain during the procedure and no need for pain killers even afterwards.

Got my second wisdom tooth extracted a couple of days back. Once again same wonderful experience. Dr Sohoni is such an expert with great table side manners. I wish he does crowns too.</Text>

Dr. Sohoni examined and prescribed me some medicines for infection n pain. He is very kind to accommodate me on his day off for the surgery. He explained everything about my teeth clearly. I went in for the appointment. Surgery was quick, took probably about 30 minutes! They took an xray after the surgery and made sure that everything's fine! I'm totally impressed by their services!

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Got my wisdom tooth extraction from Dr. Sharad Sohoni. Honestly, I was very skeptical in the starting because my case was a little complicated as the roots of my wisdom touched the nerves and the surgery wasn't going to be easy. But, the doctor assured me about the procedure he will do will be painless and safe.
My surgery went very well. Dr. Sharad Sohoni is very professional and experienced.
Even after the surgery, the ladies at the reception called me the same day to ask about my well being. They also scheduled a follow up after one week and everyone in the staff is really helpful, kind and answers to all your questions. They also gave me proper notes on diet to be followed, medicines to be taken, advices and all requisites prior and after the surgery.
Also, as mentioned by other reviews about the change in price from what quoted, I had no such experience. They charged me the same amount as they had quoted me a week prior to the surgery.
I would definitely recommend Dr. Sharad Sohoni for all your dental concerns.<//Text>< pics>

<review>The staff at the office are very helpful and patient.  I was transitioning between insurance companies, and despite the mix up with the new company, they spent hours over various days on the phone to ensure everything was set up correctly.  I had to have a tooth extraction, and Dr. Sohoni explained the process, provided me with options and answered all of my questions.  The procedure itself was relatively quick and painless.  I will add more to this review as the process will continue for the next 6-9 months before I can get my permanent implant.  I'm looking forward to the rest of the process being as seamless as the first few visits.
1/27/20: update 6 months later.  Today I returned to Dr. Sohoni’s office to get the implant surgery.  Again, I was greeted with smiles from the ladies at the front desk.  They explained my insurance coverage and reminded me of the details for the next steps after the implant is placed.  They all seem to help each other and enjoy what they do.  Once in the room, during prep, Dr. Sohoni’s assistants were engaging and reassuring and graciously answered all my questions.  When Dr. Sohoni came in the room, he greeted me and  provided expectations of what I would likely experience during the surgery.  I experienced no pain, but there was a decent amount of pressure as the rod was being tightened which was uncomfortable but brief.  The whole surgery took maybe 25-30minutes, and I was in and out in 45 minutes, with clear upcoming expectations (reiterated again by the front desk team, as they provided me with my prescriptions).  Another excellent experience all things considered. I will need to return again in approx. 3 months after the bone is solidified around the implant to have the tooth attached.<//review>< Pics>

Got wisdom tooth extracted, implant done in November 2017 by Dr Sharad Sohoni. Went very smoothly without any issues.  I have healed very well and am ready to get the measurements / crown done this Friday. All the staff working there were very helpful and friendly.< /Review>

<Review>I got my wisdom tooth extracted by Dr. Sohoni and it has been really great and pain free experience. I didn't face any issues after surgery. I took pain killers just to be at safe side otherwise I didn't get any pain.. I was back to my work next day without any swelling or discomfort !</Review></record>

Front desk office females are very rude. Surely dr sharad needs to know this and get them changed asap.<//Text>

Horrible office; unprofessional employees billed wrong insurance first, then billed by actual insurance incorrectly (not for the type of service I received), then they were rude and insulting over the phone over it. It took me persistent complaints to get the billing right. Would never deal with this office again.</Review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I worked with Adam Locke -- all via email -- and ordered an X3. The entire process was smooth. There was no pressure, no gimmicks. I felt the price was very fair and Adam responded to all my questions promptly and courteously. The car was ready the day after it arrived at the dealership, and the on-site experience was fast and smooth -- I was all done in about an hour. The finance dept was similarly straightforward and easy to work with, with just one small mention of an extended warranty (easily declined), and nothing underhanded. I will definitely be buying my next BMW from Adam and Peter Pan.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyB5tAwk7nXb5oTuDYUafeWoPdgfvfEA3myG2j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-tE5LSNfGRQBzzi7PUE_76QOOkK3oleT3aw9Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKyhLHV7dVf7tt_wYSXA6tsjzP_b0YA0ZhuGWX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbJhBv_Nq1jbm9iKmQK8vCu1rdqoT-8nyT9XRp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

My experience with Peter Pan BMW was great! This weekend I came in to check out a couple of cars they had as it was time for an upgrade and Henry was extremely helpful and made this process a breeze. He approached us and was very courteous and informative. I ended up test driving two vehicles, which never once felt like a hassle or as if we were being rushed.  I was very happy with the customer service I received and felt as thought I had a friend assisting me with the process.  Not once did I feel like I was being rushed into making any kind of decision.  The next day I came in to lock in the deal and it was such a smooth process. Henry  took his time and went through the numbers and paperwork with me. Shortly after, I finished up with the finances department and before you know it, I was driving off the lot with my new car that had just been detailed and buffed in under two hours. This is by far the best experience I've had at a dealer and I will definitely be returning to this location if ever in need.</Text>

The customer service was thoughtful, sensitive. It has been my best experience buying a BMW. This is my third BMW. By far, this is the best experience I have had at a dealership. In fact, when I left Peter Pan, I wasn’t even tired. Smooth. Thoughtful. I felt well treated. Thank you. And, a special Thank You to Khalil.</text>

On Tuesday, I bought this beautiful car! It’s a 2021 BMW 330i. Let me just say this experience was amazing! The salesman was super friendly and super helpful. He’s patient, respectful, kind, and the perfect person to go to if you need a new car! He will honestly take the time out of his day to make sure you are satisfied!  He helped me pick the perfect car for me! It’s the perfect model, color, interior, and so much more! If it wasn’t for his help, I would have never been able to pick my dream car! When we went to finance, the guy was also super amazing! He was funny and light-hearted. He made the long process fun! Overall, I would rate this experience a 1000/10 if I could. I will definitely be back in the future!</Text>

<Review>I flew from Texas to Cali to buy me a 340i M Sport Estoril Blue. The guys greeted me well and were very nice!! Ask for Mr Rebozzi! Had a great experience buying my BMW and recomend this place. The car was washed, vacuumed and detailed when I got it.  Love California and be safe!!<//Review></record>

<Review>Their reviews really speak for themselves. Excellent dealership. Even better employees! Henry is the absolute best. He helped me buy my car and made sure everything was perfect- above and beyond. Super great person, trustworthy and very responsive. He set everything up for me quickly and easily.  The gentleman who detailed my car was exceptional as well. Thank you for helping me get my perfect car!!!</Review>< Pictures>

Recently I had the wonderful opportunity to purchase a BMW X3. Before going to Peter Pan we had explored other dealers and BMW dealers in the area and our experiences left us discouraged thinking that my expectations in a car were not possible. The purchase of my dream car would not have been possible with out the hard work of their service provider Henry.

Henry worked hard for two days to make this incredible purchase happen. While working with him I felt as though he was working in the best of his customer, really taking into account what I was looking for in a car. He also had the car detailed and waxed before driving it off of the lot.

I couldn't be more thankful to Peter Pan BMW and Henry! I love my car! If you are in the market for a new car I would highly recommend this dealership and if you can ask for Henry.< /text>

I would never have considered going to a dealership for maintenance, except for the crazy bad implementation that BMW has of its Active Cruise Control and driver assists. So I stop in at Peter Pan. I was lucky to get Roberto!

Roberto was thorough, quick, and substantially added value to my day (and to my car). I prefer independent shops, but after working with Roberto, I will actually be going back to him in particular for future maintenance needs.

Give that man a raise because he just brought in a repeat customer!<//review><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

Khalil Manneh is awesome. Super friendly, helpful, and responsive. I worked with 10+ dealers across the Bay Area (BMW, Porsche, Benz, Audi, Volvo, Tesla). Peter Pan and Khalil were the most courteous.  There was no pretense, they worked within the constraints we gave them, were patient, and helpful. I'd buy or lease again without hesitation with Khalil, Adam Locke, and Peter Pan.</Text>

Andy at Peter Pan BMW was great to work with.  He had the car prepared for us to test drive when we arrived.  When we decided to buy he quickly completed the financing app while sending the car to be detailed out.  Almost all documents were able to be signed electronically and we received a flash drive with all documents instead of a whole bunch of papers.  Great experience buying from Peter Pan BMW.</Review>

We live in Monterey and received a fabulous online offer for the car we were looking for, so we made the two hour drive. J made the drive worth every minute by simplifying the purchase and staying late to complete the sale so we wouldn’t have to drive back another day. So many cars to choose from, screaming good deals, and relaxed and respectful sales professionals. The best car purchasing experience ever!<//review>

This place is absolutely the worst car dealership in the history of car dealerships. I’m convinced these people laugh at everyone who walks through the door.  I bought a car last January. It took them 5 months to send me the money for my trade in. Next, they don’t even give you the key for your tires so if you have a flag you can’t even change your tire! I call a manager absolutely no help. He asks me if I looked in my car? Nah man, I just assumed I was screwed from the beginning. Last but not least, I finally got to put a new tire on the car and guess what? They discontinued the tire I had to put on it. So, I had to put 2 new tires on the car. This place is a scam and will do absolutely nothing to help you.< /text>

A suggestion for the service dept. If a car comes in with no gas (which was strange for me because I seldom drive that car) please tell the owner!  I was fortunate to get gas before my vehicle stopped on the freeway.</Review>< Pictures>

This was my first visit to Peter Pan BMW service after recently purchasing a used i3. The facility is clean, well-organized, and the staff are courteous and helpful. My service advisor kept me informed of the progress of the repairs and when I could pick my car up. I was given a loaner to use while my car was being repaired which was very helpful. I highly recommend.</Text>

I had a wonderful and easy experience getting my new car from Peter Pan. The sales advisor Peter Galanakis went above and beyond to help me find the exact car I wanted, the price I was looking for, and expedited the entire process quickly. The entire team was very professional, and I would highly recommend anyone looking for a car to visit them, and ask for Peter Galanakis.</Review>

<Review>I have never had a better car buying experience. We worked with Khalil and Patrick who were increasingly accommodating considering we are in the middle of a pandemic. There were special precautions taken at each step and Khalil was extremely thorough, kind, and helpful throughout the whole process. A+++ for communication and cordiality! He went out of his way to accommodate our needs and helped us reach the best possible deal and outcome for the purchase. I don't think I will go anywhere else in the future for automobile purchases. We live in the East bay but it is worthwhile for us to go to Peter Pan BMW because of the trust established and the fantastic experience we had. We love our new car!

Super happy with my experience at Peter Pan. Doug went above and beyond to make sure I had all of the information I wanted and needed before making my first CPO purchase. Great communication and I have to give it to him for being extremely patient with me and all of my questions along the way.

<review>Since purchasing my first car years ago, I knew that every time going auto shopping is kind of like pulling teeth, until we visited Peter Pan BMW in San Mateo and met Khalil Manneh. I can tell every one of my friends that this guy is SUPER COOL! No B.S,. No multiple coffee breaks, super straight forward. He gives all the helpful information, took care of us and gave us a great deal.

Khalil is so friendly, he doesn’t have the typical arrogant attitude like many salesperson at luxury stores. We pick up the car the same day, K stayed late, help me install the license plate, and paired my phone. Great service!

If you are looking to purchase a BMW, look no further, call Khalil (we call him “K”), save time, save money and have a happy shopping experience.

P.S. A month after my purchase, I brought my friend and he purchase an X5. Same great experience. I highly recommend Khalil (K) and Peter Pan BMW!< /review>< time>

It was a overall great experience when I brought in my X5 for a service. Nice and clean facility and a courteous and professional staff. Kenny Lew has been my service technician and he's always been upfront and professional with what needs to be performed on my car. He also helped me a little with the repair estimate cost.< /review>

I cannot recommend him and this place enough. When I bring my other car into other service centers (European cars) they do not offer the same level customer service as Peter Pan. The lounge area is always clean and full of refreshment, keep it up Peter Pan!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>I recently purchased an auto from Adam Locke at Peter Pan BMW. I had a great experience from open to close of transaction. They are a group of a friendly and professional staff, highly effective communication and felt well informed upon purchase. I am very happy with my purchase and I recommend this business if you're in the market for a BMW</review>< Pictures>

I was helped by Khalil he really went above and beyond with everything I asked it took a bit of time for the overall purchased. But Kahlil didn't put any pressure on me to make a purchase, we were there late even after closing but he took care of me and even helped me with the service department when he was in a middle of a haircut!</review>

< Review>
I recently had an experience with Peter Pan BMW located at El Camino Real. I bought my first car in the US at this branch location and the customer service provided by the salesperson “Adam Locke” at this branch was great. He was very involved with my purchase process at all the times. He clarified my questions, doubts, and the service he provided was excellent. I was in another branch locations and his attention and service definitively were above and beyond, which was basically the reason I decided to complete my purchase at this branch. Overall, the salesperson service was great.<//Review>

This is our 3rd lease from Victor. If you go PeterPanBMW make sure to ask for Victor, he works very detailed gets you the deal you want. All staff is very nice and helpful (taking 2 toddlers to lease wasn't a good idea). I live in SF but I go PeterPan to lease because of the relationship Victor build in the last 7 years. Thank You, Victor and PeterPanBMW.< /review>

Eugene M. has been helping me lease BMWs since 2013. He always gets me the best deal by far. This time I was ready to lease a car that I wasn't "In-Love" with but my lease was expiring....Eugene M worked with me until he made the numbers work to get the car I really loved! This is why I've been driving to San Mateo to buy BMWs since 2013.<//text>

My family loves this BMW deslership and we’re on our second lease with them. They are responsive, very courteous and dedicated to their customers. Their service department is top notch which makes regular maintenance a breeze.
Huge thanks to Javed who helped with both our purchases. He went above and beyond to get us our dream car.< /Text>

<Time>1583649885825</Time><review>Our journey with Peter-Pan BMW started with contacting Adam Locke about our car needs and budget. From the get-go Adam was direct and honest. He helped us find a great BMW at a fantastic price. He understood our needs and during his day-off, asked his colleague - Khalil to show us the vehicle so that we don’t lose a good deal. The best thing about Adam was that no matter how much we haggled, no matter how many questions we asked, he addressed everything in a calm and patient manner. The entire process from buying the car to after-sales experience (its been more than 4 weeks now) has been nothing short of pleasant. We highly recommend Peter-Pan BMW and especially commend Adam for providing professional service. A big shout-out to Khalil as well who offered the test-drive and made us extremely comfortable with the vehicle - it only says that Peter-Pan BMW is a special dealership with awesome service.<//review><gmap_id>0x808f9efc33be4f95:0xc1b7f19c392f036a</gmap_id>< rate>

It's distressing when your car breaks down, and he brings a helpful calm and professionalism that makes it so much easier to deal with.

I've been a BMW owner since I got my License which was a very long time ago. Each time I've had some "awkward" or weird level of service at other BMW dealers. I heard raving reviews about Peter Pan BMW and I told myself that I will give it another try at Peter Pan BMW since they have the best reviews. I was beyond impressed by this dealer. I was taken care of from the moment my daughter and I walked in. I was greeted by Jim (nicest and most professional human being ever) He gave my daughter and the best greeting ever. Then he asked me detailed questions on what I was looking for and shared his thoughts with me. Since I had contacted this dealer ahead of time he had already had his homework done. He understood my concerns about staying within budget. I was impressed. Since at other dealers once you walk in you automatically become a target for the sales person next commission and they could care less what my needs are. At Peter Pan BMW it was such an incredible experience to know that they actually value me as a person. Then I was introduced to Javed the salesperson who was absolutely amazing. We went over our concerns in detail and he literally showed me 10 different scenarios to make sure that I am getting the best deal. He didn't try to pull a fast one one me like other BMW dealers always do! While we were going through my options and scenarios other members of the team (wish I could remember their names) introduced themselves  and they offered coloring books and other fun activities. I was so shocked. We even watched one of the salesperson granddaughters video which was so cute and it really touched our hearts. My daughter was so impressed now she wants to go there all the time now. As we were going through each of these details Jim was touching base with us each time to see if we were okay and if we needed anything. I personally saw that they were very busy, but they had made each of us customers feel like loyalty. I was able to select the 2020 BMW 530i Sedan  which is very beautiful and I know it fits my personality.  We also had the pleasure of meeting the Finance manager Shakeeb (Shack) he was just as professional and amazing to work with. He was very personable and easy to understand. I had expressed my concerns of being a single mother and how I needed to stay within my budget. He 100% understood me and shared that he had a beautiful daughter and understood my concerns as a parent. I like that Peter Pan BMW followed the covid guidelines which made me feel a little safer to be shopping for a car. The test drive was amazing and after a few lights I knew I wanted the car.  The car was ready and clean. What I want to highlight is that Jim is incredible. He was kind enough to get on a call with my brother (who works at another dealer) to go over my loan and the different scenarios that made sense for my budget. I was very grateful for this extra step. What I really love about Peter Pan BMW is that they didn't take advantage of me and the level of service was beyond measure. Can't wait till I go back when it's time to get a new car!  Heartfelt thanks for all their support and professionalism.  I also like that they respected me a person specially as woman. Since at other BMW's I would feel very violated or the salesperson would speak to me as I'm 2nd class citizen. Peter Pan BMW thank you for the outstanding level of service!! Also, I had 4 different dealers give me BS offers for my trade in value. Peter Pan BMW gave me the most amazing deal. I was even shocked myself. So beyond grateful!<//Text>

TLDR: The sales people can be rude, only allow 5-10 minute test drives.

At first, the sales people at Peter Pan seemed very nice and accommodating. I scheduled an appointment for a test drive the day before, and we only waited a short time (10-15 min) for someone to see us. They were very friendly and gave us the keys and told us to take the car out - no further guidance.

We really enjoyed the test drive, it confirmed We liked the car and helped us learn which features were most important. We arrived back at the dealership about 30 minutes after driving off the lot. As soon as I entered, the salesman yelled from across the lobby that I almost got him fired before taking a call as I awkwardly stood there with the keys, and then continued to tell me that I had taken way too long. Apparently, test drives here should only last 5-10 minutes. I don’t think that is reasonable amount of time to figure out if you want to purchase a car. We were going to test out some other models, but the salesman kept harping on how we had almost gotten him fired and took way too long (despite being given absolutely no guidance beforehand). We decided it was not a good setting to make a major purchase and promptly left. I would look elsewhere before coming to this dealership.< /Text>

Kenny (Service Advisor) is consistently excellent.  He earns my business and justifies a drive for service from the east bay.

This is a top-notch service center, with excellent staff and facilities.  Highly recommended for all of your BMW parts/service needs.  Ask for Kenny! :)<//review>

Henry is an all-star salesperson - as in, an absolute delight to work with. Honest, straight-forward, thoughtful, and fun - Henry went above-and-beyond at every step of the way to help me find a great deal and to make sure I got the right car for my needs, whether it was helping research accessories or texting answers to questions well after business hours. A zillion questions patiently answered via text and phone call later, he even helped me ask the ones I didn't know I ought to. Wild to write a review about a salesperson who had my best interest in mind - but that's Henry. Put your next car purchase in his hands and you won't be disappointed!</Review>

Had a surprisingly bad experience today as normally service is excellent and trustworthy. Took my 2004 325i in for an airbag recall which was promoted as a Recall Service Event.  Along with this service, they also performed a courtesy inspection and a free car wash.  However, after I picked up my 325i today, I had a *significant* driveability issue and I had to pull off the road and stop the car.  Numerous calls late in the afternoon on Friday went unanswered after being transferred from an operator - one at 5:45 PM even told me that folks had gone home for the day.  After a 5th call,  I was able to speak to someone but the issue was not resolved to my satisfaction and the car remains undriveable.  Perhaps the review trends shown in Yelp in 2020 are accurate and reflect a declining level of service at this dealership - as ratings appear lower than in previous years.  That's too bad as I have another newer 528i which  I'll have to find a new service department to trust.< /Text>

While most people dislike shopping for a new car I accept it as a challenge. I have had both good and bad experiences over the years. As this was the first BMW I have purchased I wanted to make sure that I did adequate research and visited six dealerships. My final selection was with Adam L. and Doug M. of Peter Pan BMW. They earned my trust and my business.
--Honest, straightforward assistance from day one.
--Kept me informed of special promotions and the logistics of delivery (car was special ordered from Munich).
--When I had questions, they were answered promptly. I was also introduced to a number of different BMW Product 	Genius Assistants for technical advice.
--No high-pressure sales effort. Very cordial and professional communications throughout the transaction.
--Very satisfied with my price and the entire purchase and delivery process.
--Have already referred friends to Peter Pan because of the superior treatment I received.<//Text>

Great staff and best dealer I've been to so far.

I worked with Javed and Shakeeb to buy a CPO BWM car. They are great, patient and super helpful. They don't judge you or talk you into things you don't really need. It took us a whole day there to finish all the documents and  signs. They help us with everything we need, answer questions of first buyers. They build a good brand impression on us, I will definitely consider BMW again when I need to buy another car or lease a car.

Also want to mention the front desk is helpful!</Text>

<text>An oil change was overdue and since my 2017 330x sport wagon was coming up on 4yr, I had the diagnostic done too. When the car was returned, I got a new ding and scratch on the rear lift door. The ding looks like the door was hit with a pointed object.  Fortunately, my service representative took full responsibility and the car is now scheduled to be repaired at their affiliated body shop next week- along with a loaner. Thats why I only gave 4 stars.  As background, I've owned BMWs since 1984 and had several cars serviced by Peter Pan over the yrs and never had any body damage.<//text>< rate>

< review>
I was promised a price for a BMW X4 and the next day, after I had gone through the trouble of finding a buyer for my old car and planning an 800 mile drive to Seattle (from California), I was told by the general manager of Peter Pan BMW that they are not going to honor their promised price. They said their sales representative hadn't confirm the price with the manager before promising it to me (as a client, I don't think I need to know that).

In case you are curious, the reason why we didn't close the deal the previous day was that we needed time to arrange for the delivery of the car to Seattle and to make sure that they could do that on the timeline at which we needed the car. The sales agent prepared all the paper work for the deal that we had agreed on and everything was ready for me to sign the next day.

Long story short, I ended up having to pay $2000 higher than their promised price to get the car, which, at that point, I had to do to avoid a full collapse of all my subsequent plans (with the sales of my old car and my trip to Seattle coming up). The general manager literally told me that they don't care what the client (i.e. I) was told the day before. He continued, if I had sigend the documents the night before he would have kept the lower price [read: wouldn't have been ABLE to change it to the higher price] but now he was not going to honor their own word.

That all said, the sales people were very helpful and considerate (I wish I could leave a separate rating for that). I think I got the manager on his bad day, but I expect a general manager of a big (and otherwise reputable) corporate like BMW not to pass the ongoing internal frictions and conflicts on to their clients.

I thought this was the end of the drama with the Peter Pan BMW and was glad that I didn't have to go back there again after I leave the lot ... But I was up for a big surprise!

At the noon of Oct 24th, I sold my old vehicle right outside of this dealership to buy the car from the Peter Pan BMW that I had sigend some of the documents for already (including the price breakdown agreement). As I was signijg the rest of the documents the manager came up and summoned the sales representative who was helping me sign the documents ... A few minutes later I was told that they were not going to sell the car to me because they had realized that I had left this review for them (I had posted the sections above this paragraph on Yelp the prior evening). This was utterly upsetting, but I will try to be professional an just write what I observed as opposed to how I feel.

Reading this whole note again, it is possible that the manager's ego couldn't handle the part that I said "[he] wouldn't have been ABLE to [cancel the sale if I had signed the documents]". So, CAUTION!! If, despite my experience, you decide to do business with this dealership make sure you understand that the managerial team here may have a delicate ego and, evidently, this is how they treat customers that they make unhappy, just to protect their delicate egos.<//review>

I purchased a 2020 840i Coupe from Peter Pan BMW. This is the second BMW I have purchased from this dealer. I returned to this dealer because I received excellent support and service for my last car, a 650i convertible. The buying experience was exceptional. The sales person, Adam Locke, was very knowledgeable and professional. He was very responsive to questions and requests. The administrative person who handled the closing documents was also very professional. The 840i handles even difficult road conditions very well and the safety and driver assistance features are truly state-of-the-art.<//review>

I had a fantastic experience at Peter Pan BMW. My service advisor, Oliver, was very friendly, patient, informative & thorough in his approach to fixing any immediate repairs & recalls. He kept me posted at every step & asked for my approval for any repairs. While my car was being serviced, I enjoyed driving the new loaner BMW. I highly recommend Peter Pan BMW.</Review>

Shoutout to Peter Pan BMW. I loved my experience here and the process was quick. I went for a certified preowned 2017 BMW X3. This was my first car purchase and I never could have dreamed that I would be able to afford a BMW at such an incredible value. the Internet Sales Manager is Doug Miller. He is a very professional individual and puts great attention to detail on the quality of the car and care for his customers. There was great inspection done, providing new equipment and fine detailing to prepare the car. The sales and finance people are not pushy at all. They are good humans who hold high integrity and professionalism for the brand and their customers. I hope my X3 will last me many years and I look forward to working with Doug and his team one day in the future again.</Text>

Thinking seriously about purchasing a BMW? You should speak to Adam Locke. Reach out on the Peter Pan BMW website. Start here. Really.
Do you like saving time and energy? Would you like to secure and get the vehicle vehicle you want without hassles about a truly great deal? Talk to Adam Locke. You don’t have to talk to anyone else.
He and his associate Khalil Manneh are total professionals. Khalil literally unwrapped my prospective 430i Coupe to enable me to test drive the car. My car confirmed that BMW makes the ultimate driving machine.
I rate my customer experience a solid 10. This is my third BMW purchase and the first at Peter Pan BMW. By far the smoothest, hassle free and satisfying ultimate customer experience was with Adam and Khalil.</text>

New to the BMW brand and planning to special order a new 3 series, I was helped by Javed Ahmadzai. Javed was friendly, efficient, concise, and most importantly not pushy during the buying process. In anticipation to receive delivery of my new car, he told me about the BMW Connected App/My Garage to track my special order. The tracker was a nifty resource as you can check on the status of your vehicle from the start to finish (Think Domino’s Pizza tracker, except it’s for your BMW).

When my car was finally delivered to Peter Pan, Javed smoothly sorted out all of the paper work, while Tom at finance gave an efficient, concise and no pressure rundown of the warranty options. Once all the paper work and payment was finalized, Javed oriented my family and I about the car and took his time to to answer all our questions.

As a first time buyer of BMW, Peter Pan BMW made a great first impression to represent one of the best car brands in the world.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808f9efc33be4f95:0xc1b7f19c392f036a<//GmapID></record>

<text>Khalil was AWESOME!! My husband & I went in not knowing if we wanted to purchase or lease. He was kind, funny, & very patient as we had a ton of questions. We took up a lot of his time & not once did we feel pressured to buy. He worked with us until we found just the right car while keeping us within our budget! This isn’t my first purchase with BMW, and honestly, no comparison to the service we received at Peter Pan BMW! They really take care of you! Thank you to Khalil, Peter, & Shak! They went above & beyond & we love our brand new 2020 X3!!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1581683761216, 'text': "Christina,  It sounds like you had a quality experience from start to finish, which makes us very happy!

I highly recommend this place! Steve was extremely nice and he took care of my car really well and kept me well informed about the services, processes and time it's gonna take. He even offered complementary car wash and I was pretty impressed to see how good a job these guys had done. Peter Pan BMW also offers loaner car service which also made things really convenient for me. I'll be back here when it's time for the next service.</review>

< review>
Youbert the floor manager made the whole test driving experience very unpleasant. The way he spoke and the comments he made was unprofessional. He made us feel like we were not worth his time. One of our friend that was with us had to walk away because he couldn't stand his demeanor.

We were looking for a specific model for our next dream car. However, he did not want to let us test drive at the beginning. Making excuses stating all those models were manual. Okay, that's not what your website inventory says. Then, he says you can sit in the passenger side and get the feel of the car while I drive it. 🤔 okay, am I going to have you drive the car around for me if I purchase the car?
Well, after finding out what we do for a living, then he decided to let us test drive the car.

Thanks but no thanks. Since this experience was so unpleasant, it had sucked out the fun of the car. We had decided to spend more money on a much better and faster car. Good luck. Next time don't judge a book by its cover.< /review>

I leased a new BMW from Peter Pan BMW.  Peter Galanakis is the advisor who helped me.  My experience working with Peter and the other folks at Peter Pan BMW was excellent.  Peter was very helpful and knowledgeable about the vehicle I was interested in, and he helped make my leasing experience truly easy.  Peter was patient in letting me make my decision without being “pushy” (like some car salespeople sometimes can be).  He seemed truly interested in helping me find the vehicle that was right for me, and not just to make a sale.  I truly appreciate his assistance, and would highly recommend Peter, and the folks at Peter Pan BMW, to anyone looking for a BMW!  I will definitely return to Peter (if he is still with Peter Pan BMW) when my lease is over.<//text>

This was my first experience at Peter Pan BMW and as a long time BMW customer, I was incredibly impressed with this dealership. Rob Renson was fantastic as he provided on-going support throughout my day, connecting me with fantastic professionals and ensuring my experience was focused on my needs. Doug Miller was simply awesome - a true professional. He took the time to discuss my needs, preferences and how I like to review options. He spent the time to run through multiple scenarios and put together a great deal. I can’t say enough how refreshing it was to work with a sales person who really listened and delivered complete client-oriented service. Plus the support staff, (Johnny in Finance and Yuri in Genius) were amazing. The whole experience exceeded my expectations and I’m a committed client?< /text>

I’ve just bought my second car from Henry Sipor at Peter Pan BMW. As with every time I deal with Henry, and BMW, it was a pleasure. Henry is professional and makes me feel like he’s really working for me. He takes as much time as I need to get me what I want. I’ll never buy a car anywhere else, or with anyone else. Not everyone can say that buying a car is a  pleasure, but with Henry, and both Peter Pan sales, and service, it really is.< /Text>

Buying a car experience was far far beyond my expectations.
My manger was Eugene Masalitin and thanks to his great professional skills I've got my CPO BMW X1 in just a 2.5 hours from entering the dealership till leaving it behind-the-wheel of my first BMW car!
I'm more than satisfied with the price I've got for the car as well as the maintenance options.
Already recommended friend to buy BMW in Peter Pan.
Thank you guys for great help :)</Review>

Completely different from other dealers just taking you for a quick ride. Our sales Doug was professional and his abundance on car sale knowledge informed us to make the right decision for our purchase, we are lucky to get our car through him. Highly recommended, five star.< /review>< pictures>

I've been working for SF BMW for past two leases, and ended up reaching out to Peter Pan because of a better deal. In addition to getting a better deal, I also got better service.

<Text>TLDR; sales service was rude as hell

Victor made it very clear from the first second that he wanted nothing to do with me. I initially called to ask if a car on their website was still available - he sounded annoyed that I would bother to verify. I knew exactly what car I wanted, so I went down to the dealership just to make sure it was visually alright. The second I walked into his office he made it clear that I was wasting his time. He literally threw a fit when I told him I don't have insurance (I currently don't own a car) and that it was such a burden to ride along with me. Once in the car I asked him very basic questions and he knew absolutely nothing about it. When I realized it didn't have the features I was looking for (my mistake not reading the full description online), he said there were too many cars for him to know what was on the lot. Victor, I told you I was buying an X1. There were literally 5 pre-owned X1s on the lot. Not a lot to juggle. When we got back from the drive I mentioned that other dealerships had the same car with the features I wanted for the same price - he vaguely waved at the lot and walked back into the building.

The funny thing is I convinced my partner to buy his X3 here a few months earlier. Guess I wasn't worth a second sale.</Text>< gmapID>

As usual, I sent an email to the dealership requesting a quote and more information, but this time the experience was different (in a very positive way!).  Doug was quick to respond to my inquiry, and after a very short phone call late in the evening (he was on his way out the door and still took my call), we had a lease price and terms that met and exceeded our expectations.  Since we live in the Modesto area, I needed some reassurance that the information Doug provided was all encompassing and that the car would be held so that we could make a trip over there the following day to check everything out and finalize the deal.  With a very friendly and inviting tone, he assured me that it was all good, and this made me feel much more comfortable.  I could tell right then that Doug was no ordinary salesperson just looking to make a sale, but he was actually trying to make our experience an effort-free one.  Once we got to the dealership the next day, we met Doug and he started a process with us that I have to admit was the most enjoyable and smooth car leasing experience that I ever had!  We absolutely love our new X5, and after not owning or leasing a BMW in the past, we are now proud members of the BMW family and plan to be for years to come!  Thanks again, Doug, for your outstanding customer service, as well as all of the wonderful staff at Peter Pan BMW for making our day!</review>< username>

Henry was absolutely amazing! He helped us pick the right car, gave us an awesome deal and was extremely accommodating with paperwork. I was in and out in minutes..He understood what I was looking for and respected my budget. He was not at all pushy which I greatly appreciated!

This BMW dealership is a friendly and proffesoo no al one.  Jordan is a great Service Advisor. I was treated very well from the moment my issue arose to the moment my vehicle was repaired and back in my possession. Followed up daily with status updates. Accommodated me on the type of vehicle I wanted for a loaner. All around quality service.
Thank you Jordan</Review>

Got an incredible deal on an X3 and the sales experience with Peter G was the best car transaction I've ever had. Down to earth, sincere, and chill, not a blabby mouthed pusher. Very, very sweet deal and smooth experience.< /Review>

<review>Had the best car leasing experience possible. Adam L. in  the sales dept made the process simple and easy. He is an honest and decent sales person, which is a challenge to find.  We checked every BMW dealership in the Bay Area and Sacramento and found that the deal at Peter Pan was by far much better than any other dealership. We arrived almost at closing time to get the car so the dealership stayed open later for us to wash the car, complete paperwork, and teach me some of the cool gadgets on my beemer. I have leased and owned many cars and am probably one of the most pickiest people to work with when it comes getting a deal. I know the deal I received was great and I have never been happier with a leasing experience. I will be calling Adam at Peter Pan for sure to get me another BMW when this lease is up.< /review>< Rating>

We were called by this location and asked when we would like to bring in our car for it's maintenance of an oil change during COVID, we asked if we could push off given our daughter has epilepsy. The sales men said it would void our warranty - note this sales men can see our lease mileage. We decided to risk it as they called again, and made plans all around safety. When we arrived they said our car was no longer under warranty and they wanted to charge us $650. They also took 0 responsibility for the bait and switch, and said they don't know who called. We talked to the General Manager of the Dealership: Jim and the General Manager of the Service Dept: Bob to make this right, and they didn't and were extremely unprofessional. During the drop off the Service folks let us know they weren't getting any business, so this was a push by them and they know it (Marketing 101). I hope they can live with themselves that they decided to pressure us into bringing our car in, so they can make a few hundred dollars while risking our daughters life. Awesome work.< /review>< Date>

This was a very positive experience. Wai saw me on short notice for some semi emergency repairs. She was responsive, knowledgeable, and very professional.
Couldn’t be more pleased.< /Text>

< review>
What the... Is that supposed to be 'value add'? I dropped off my car on Friday morning for a recall service. At the service desk they asked my permission to wash it. I said, "Well, it's a soft top, you cannot put it through a machine... Anyway, I just washed it the night before last." The clerk said "Ok, I'll make a note to hand wash it." I picked up my car Saturday morning, and it looks like someone mopped the garage floor and poured the bucket of dirty water over the car. The windows are all streaked, inside and out, and the rims have never looked that filthy since I've owned the car. I hope the mechanic took better care of my vehicle than the person who washed it! I can't accurately rate this service visit. I'll have to wait to see if parts start falling off. Thanks for the doughnuts. :(<//review>

I've been a loyal customer for about 7 years they are a bit expensive yes however you get what you pay for and you know it's trusted work so if you take your vehicle as important as you take your own body and health this is the place to go and if there is an issue they will resolve it they also give you a nice loaner car S UV and will top off fluids oil and washer fluid washing car treat it with care tell them #worldfamousPatLyons recommended 👌<//review>

<Review>As I was driving on 280 south today 5/5 at 11.10am near South San Francisco, a black bmw attempted to force insert in front of me from one of the ramps (I was on the further right lane). The driver was driving fast and then continued driving recklessly, changing multiple lanes at a time and tailgating other cars. It was obvious that his driving was unsafe. All of that with a peterpanbmw.com sticker on the back window. If that’s how you treat your cars, then I will never purchase from you. I hope this review helps other people as well.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1588770474393, 'text': 'Alexandre,\n\nWe have over 100 Loaner cars active and on the road daily as an complimentary amenity for our Clients during essential repairs and maintenance at our Burlingame Service Center.\n\nWhile the vehicles are in use, we have to follow California mandated privacy regulations.\n\nI am sincerely sorry to hear of your experience.\n\nJim Cyr\nGeneral Manager\nPeter Pan BMW'}</Resp><GmapID>0x808f9efc33be4f95:0xc1b7f19c392f036a</GmapID></record>

My wife and I just purchased a BMW 330i from Peter Pan BMW and it was truly a great car buying experience, thanks to the excellent customer service we received from Javed.  He is without a doubt 'top notch' at his job! He was very knowledgeable, and was able to answer all our questions. He was not pushy, instead easy going, transparent, and made everything smooth and understandable.  Would recommend Javed to anyone!</review>

Useless front desk employees dismissed us before even hearing everything, as we went to the location for an appraisal, and an appointment was made for the service center. They kept saying we were in the wrong location and very patronizingly said "type Service Center in Google maps" and "we cleared it up as much as we possibly could". That wasn't even the point... Very quick to talk, slow to listen. I guess they'll have front desk jobs for the rest of their lives. If that.< /review>

Ken did a nice job assisting me. The cost of repairs estimate and specific work needed is very valuable.

The cost of a peter pan mechanic is beyond my budget. So I an taking my older bmw to a german repair shop with the info they require from peter pan bmw mechanic's assesment.

The two hundred dollar diagnostic is a valuable service to invest in.

I think the shop I am going to is a good one for an older car. But a look from bmw mechanic is a good idea first.

Have always had decent service at peter pan.< /Text>

He was honest, quick to find pertinent information, and extremely respectful of my time and money! He surely exceeded my expectations...Roberto informed me as the progress of the extended warranty issue was fixed!  I was honestly surprised at how well, and often, he communicated w/ both myself and my wife (compared to other service depts.)

Thank you Roberto for the killer service...we really appreciate it!  The ladies at the front desk were awesome. Super helpful, nice, and fun to hang out with when I waited for my shuttle home!

...on the front end I wish, via the phone, I was provided some more upfront info regarding, what seemed to me, a very well known warranty issue. I provided my year/make/model & vin but no information was provided and I was faced w risking $200 in diagnostics even though I was almost certain it was going to be covered!

Overall we are very appreciative of how our Peter Pan BMW service visit went!

I always enjoy coming to his location. They've always provided me with great service and have treated me very well, both for the repairs to my car and for the pre-post customer experience such as providing me rides to my work after I drop off my car and picking me up when I'm coming to pick up my car, providing a complimentary car wash, and overall timely communication during my repairs so I'm aware of what's happening. Only docking one star due to an issue with my most recent repair job where I was repeatedly informed it was the passenger side airbag was the one that needed repairs instead of the driver's side airbag, which to me makes a big difference.</Text>

I am new to CA and needed to do something with an existing BMW lease.  I was familiar with Peter Pan BMW via service so thought I would start with them.  Patrick Castano worked with me and did a phenomenal job.   I equate buying cars with things like the DMV and the dentist but this was a great experience and I would work with Patrick and this dealership again.< /text>

The service team attended to my issue immediately. The service advisor, Gus, did a quick exam of my car, advised me of the condition and provided repair options. I like the fact that Gus gave me options to consider such that I could pick one which fit my needs and budget. Gus also did a great job keeping me informed of the status of the work and helped arrange for the shuttle ride.< /Review>< Pictures>

He worked hard to get the price we asked for, and though it wasn't perfect he was still able to get us a small discount. My test drive was with another guy, who seemed very uninterested by the sale and it felt like our time was waisted as he wouldn't even take our offer into consideration. So I took a star off for that. On a whole the dealership is clean and modern. Plenty of coffee and goodies while you wait. Thanks again Jay!< /Text>< Pics>

In just one visit Iuliiia Adamovich helped me trade in my old car and drive away in my new 2019 330i. I love it. I can't stop bragging about it.
I had a 328d and I thought I could never get anything better. 328d mpg far exceeds what the manufacturer advertises. And still 2019 330i has gone further.

Iuliia helped me with trade in, selection and finances, plus the few follow up questions that I had in the following weeks.
Very Happy.< /review>

It can be a worrisome and stressful process when you and/or your vehicle are involved in an accident. It makes a huge difference when you feel taken care of by the service professionals. Oliver is that person who took care of us and our car during this time. He is an extremely courteous professional who is very knowledgeable, quick, and reliable. He’ll keep in good communication with you throughout. His professionalism helps ease the innate stress surrounding a situation like this, and as a car owner that is greatly appreciated.< /text>

<review>I already have my new BMW 330e for a month, and it's such an excellent experience working with Adam Locke before and after I bought the car. I was recommended by friend to lease a new car from Adam, and he did give me the best deals without wasting time to negotiate back and forth. I contacted Adam on Saturday night of Labor Day and the next day I drove a brand new car out of Peter Pan within an hour after I got there. Even though this is my first time leasing a car, he made the whole leasing process very smooth and straight forward. I am so glad that I leased the car with Adam at Peter Pan BMW, if you are looking for a BMW, don't hesitate to contact Adam Locke at Peter Pan, you deserve to get the best.< /review>< pictures>

We custom-ordered an X1 and picked it up yesterday.  Neither my wife nor I had a lot of time, and we arrived late for the agreed pickup time.  And the DMV paperwork etc. is tedious.  And, Peter Pan just had changed over from paper-based processing to a fancy new electronic system.  All combined that's a recipe for a good experience.  However, at the end we were very positively surprised.  There was a little hiccup initially, but after intervention the process went very smoothly indeed, and the slight delay we perceived was entirely excusable in the light of the courteous, fast, efficient, and gracious service we received.< /Review>

I was in search of replacing my 428i lease and upgrading to a 440i purchase. Found the exact vehicle through Peter Pan BMW. Although our travel distance was 100+ miles, it was well worth it. Peter Wan was exceptional to work with and personable. We ran into a snag with pricing. Fortunately the manager was willing to work with us or offer the original quoted price. Recommend Peter Wan as he is to the point and kind without the grueling salesman mentality. We love our 440! Thank you Peter Wan, Adam and hilarious Shak in finance.</text>

This is an initial review since I only recently have been coming here. Tom at the Parts counter is great, he's really helpful and knows his stuff. I have returned like 6 or more times for parts since I like to service my own BMW.

As for the service department, I've only had my car in there once. My car went into limp mode for a leaky injector. I towed it to Peter Pan and they replaced all 4 as well as the spark plugs but it cost me $2000.  The labor was only $500, so I can't complain too much. I just wish I researched the repair myself first because I might have gotten away with cleaning them and replacing the seals. Oh well, they still did an awesome job< /Review>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>Car is good but the service is not that good. Spending 80% time on waiting. Also, I scheduled the test drive two times with the sales but they didn't get the car ready for both two times and I didn't get a chance to test that car when I arrive. Finally I chose another car from peter pan but I have to say the experience is not as good as I expected.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I purchased a 430i yesterday from Henry Sipor. I  had been searching for the exact model and Henry worked with me to make sure we could close the deal. He was very attentive and knowledgeable which made the purchasing experience less tense (not my favorite thing to do by far). In addition to Henry, I worked with Shak to finalize the financing. He was also very enjoyable and easy to work with. I ended up with a great rate and an overall great experience! Thanks Henry and Shak and Peter Pan BMW. We'll be back when the time comes for another car.</review>

<Text>Been to a few BMW dealership in the area but I feel if I had started from here I would have not gone anywhere else.  In size they are smaller because of which their on-site inventory is smaller but they makeup for it in service.  They don't have a service center here so their focus is selling and I felt their level of service perhaps for that matter was better.  Did have issues taking on time delivery which they recognized and accommodated for on their own well.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>The whole process of leasing my new BMW i3 was seamless from start to finish. I found Henry Sipor the ultimate fleet manager, to be immensely helpful, courteous and professional in finding a new version of the i3 in the color/trim/options I was looking for. As a return customer for Peter Pan BMW, my standards were high, and I was not disappointed in any part of the transaction. Having previously leased a BMW 328i and then the electric i3, and am now back to replace the i3 with the newer version that has a longer range, I am certain to return again. Henry worked very hard to identify the car I was looking for and let me know as soon as the vehicle was arriving while getting me an amazing deal. I came into the showroom, examined the gorgeous car, made a decision right away. Very soon I was driving home with a big smile on my face in my new i3. Thank you very much Henry for your professionalism and I shall return again.</review>< GmapID>

<review>Adam Locke helped me lease a 2017 i3.  It was the fastest and most pleasant leasing experience I've had.  This is my 4th lease but my first with Peter Pan.  Adam's service and positive attitude beat all the others.  If I had made up my mind about the features, it would have taken less than 1 hour.  How's that for speed?  He took care of everything from start to finish.  Adam even helped the Finance Manager.  She was also very delightful to work with.  I recommend you give your business to Adam.  He's the best!</review>< pictures>

<userid>114251561590784370866< /userid><text>Peter Pan BMW by far was my best dealership experience.  I have owned and leased a dozen cars and by far this was most enjoyable I ended up buying two new vehicles in the same night only interested in the one.  Rob Taylor sales rep was a huge part of the overall experience.  His knowledge and structure of the deal made was done with my best interest in mind.  He guided and asked the right questions to find me what I was looking for.  Turned out that my second car was better to get out of and get into a 2nd BMW.  I did a double deal and it was the fastest process I have ever seen. The information was entered electronically and sent to finance manager.  While waiting the lobby had tv, comfortable seating lounge, complimentary water and coffee.  The vending machines were loaded with great snack and was able to use my Apple Watch with Apple Pay to get snacks from the machine.  Once inside the finance the digital desk with LED screen built in was impressive.  Start to finish was 10-15 minutes.  It was super fast and all electronic.  He handed me a thumb drive usb and said congrats you own two BMW’s.  All your contract files are added to a thumb drive making it very green and efficient. Rob Taylor again put our temp plates on had it pulled up from detail to the front and walked us through some features of X7 and 330i. We couldn’t have picked a better place to buy.  We came from the Northbay but it was well worth it.   They have a great deal of inventory which made finding something we really wanted easy.  We will definitely be loyal to Peter Pan BMW next go around.</text>< pics>

I just got new whip!!! Omg! The service here is so great and everyone treated me like I'm their family member. They will take care of you no matter what and I love how fast they respond to all my emails and texts/calls. I would highly recommend Iuliia A., Javed, Eugene!!! All paperwork was done pretty quick even though they were so busy. Anyway whoever wants to buy a car or lease this is so far the best place and Thank you so much Peter Pan for giving me such a great  opportunity with my purchase! Btw, food court with little snacks is nice too!</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I haven't been working in the United States for long and don't have a stellar credit history. So I walked into the dealership expecting to be dismissed quickly like I had been the day before in another BMW dealership. I was pleasantly surprised when Adam Locke greeted me warmly, patiently answered all my questions and provided information of several different cars that I was interested in, both leasing and buying. Throughout the whole process he was polite, knowledgeable, and professional. Coco, the financial manager, was also extremely helpful in helping me figuring out the best way to work with my limited credit history. I drove home that day a satisfied customer, in a new 2 series convertible.

Bottom line: I would recommend this dealership to anyone who's interested in a BMW.</text><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

<review>I just leased my new BMW I3 at this PeterPan location. The dealership is not huge which helps a lot. You get personal service. I got a great lease deal for 3 years. Sergio Castro was of great help. In addition, one of their BMW genius techs Ed Chow helped me setup all the options in the car and answered tons of questions I had on every little detail. The full technology package is very nice. Overall, very satisfied.</review>< user_name>

Victor Hong (Rockstar salesperson) had the car, knew exactly what I was looking for, went over all the options, financing (lease) patiently waited while I called my insurance representative to fax over proof of insurance so I could take advantage of a loyalty program (BMW) Meanwhile, car was cleaned, waxed and charged ready to go.

I never leave a negative review for bmw service stores. But I have to report this store. The service is really unprofessional. They didn’t really hear customer needs but just keep charging me. Also I forgot  my wallet in the car being served there but when I got back my car. My wallet is gone! I asked them, they simply tell me that they are not responsible for anything valuable even without helping to ask around.<//Review>

<text>So I pursued one BMW at Peter Pan San Mateo and was all fine but after I get the car I received multiples tickets about expired registration because on the BMW they don’t print the temporary registration and put on my car! And now they are making me pay all those tickets because they say the police officers was wrong in give me tickets for expired registration they are arrogant and said the I do not understand about law and if I want to get money from BMW for I go forward and suit them is this all being an nightmare!</text>< Pictures>

I recently renewed my lease and was even more impressed with Henry. He’s always looking out for you and willing to tell you how it is. In my opinion, that’s all you can ask for in a sales rep: to be honest and to help you get what you want. Period.

I knew i had gone over my lease mileage but with his help i was still able to secure the car i wanted without overpaying. Love my new BMW. Thanks Henry!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Review>Went here browsing for cars to make an informed decision. However, both my girlfriend and I felt stressed by the seller and it was not a pleasant experience whatsoever.

This is kind of odd, since the previous BMW dealership (in Santa Rosa) I went to they were super nice.

I would definitely not buy from that salesperson and most likely not from the dealer. I recommend people looking elsewhere.</Review>< Pics>

Adam Locke has been my salesman from beginning of my journey in purchasing a Build your own BMW. He has always been there to answer my questions. Very polite and absolutely not pushy at all in leasing it, buying it etc. I truly believe that Adam is sterling at what he does best. He accommodates the customer.
Thank you Adam!!! You are a true asset to Peter Pan BMW!!< /Text>

Excellent dealership to buy your next BMW. Raj Poojary was my sales person who helped me throughout the process. They make sure you are taken care all along and drive home with a new car. Everyone in the team who I interacted with, was very helpful and was focused on customer success.< /text>

I needed a specialty tire replaced without an appointment. They had it in stock and gave me a new loaner car while they kept my car.
A very positive and polite experience.< /Review>

Excellent customer service, Bob was friendly, experienced & thoughtful.  He was willing to work with us & offered fair price, meanwhile, he also built long term good will interests for the company.   Reputable company relies on super employee like them to upkeep the company name.  That's why we already have four BMW in our family.  Thanks to Bob & Kenny.  Mr. & Ms. Lau</review>

<Text>Last month I was planning to trade my car(2017 Toyota Camry) to a pre-owned BMW 3 series, so I decided to go directly to Peter Pan BMW and check the cars they had, I met Javed Ahmadzai there he showed me few 3 series, I took almost 2 weeks to decide if I wanted to go ahead with the deal as I was not able to make up my mind, thanks to Javed Ahmadzai he was patient enough and gave me my time to decide about the car, After 2 weeks I decided to buy the new 2019 330i and Javed gave the best deal he could and finally I got my new car, Javed is knowledgeable and easy to work with! He helped me find the perfect new Car with all the options needed at the best price.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Even though only there were no appointments available until later in the week, because of the oil leak, I wanted the dealership to accommodate me sooner rather than later. They were not only able to accommodate me virtually the next day but when the repairs took longer than anticipated, they even arrange a loaner car for me. The service adviser kept me appraised at every step of the way. Very good service overall and very satisfied.<//Text>< Pictures>

Best and most efficient car buying process I've ever had. Adam Locke was the difference maker here. He made the process smooth, quick and pleasant. He communicated frequently and effectively,  keeping me updated every step of the way. Adam spent considerable time helping me find the car I wanted. I couldn't be more pleased!</Review>

<Time>1518666975711</Time><rating>5</rating><review>I worked with Adam Locke at Peter Pan BMW in San Mateo, and he was the best salesperson I've ever bought a car from.  I bought a CPO i3 from him a few weeks ago for a great price. A couple days after I bought the car, I got concerned because I discovered a few issues with the car. Adam worked with me to schedule a time to come in, pickup a loaner while they took a look at it. Without getting in to too much detail, Adam did the right thing and took great care of me by fixing the issues. The car looks/feels/drives like it's brand new.  Picking up the loaner and dropping it off took 2 minutes.

I cannot recommend Adam or Peter Pan BMW enough. Thank you!< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808f9efc33be4f95:0xc1b7f19c392f036a<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>This review is mainly for the sales department and the salesman Doug Miller.  When I walked in, I already had my preconceived notions of pushy car salesmen and simply getting the "shorter end of the stick".  This, however, was not the case with Doug.  I went to Peter Pan having done a fair amount of research for the best deals on a certified pre-owned (cpo) X5.  Doug was more than patient and accommodating with my inquiries.  I left for that day with numbers, prices, and inventory to think about and to do more research and he gladly agreed to meet with me for any outstanding questions I might have had.  I was able to set up an appointment with him in 2 days and it was on that day that I had made my purchase for a cpo X5.  Because of Doug, I felt confident in my purchase and would recommend him to anyone looking for the best and honest deal from Peter Pan.
I took away one star because there was only one car key when I was promised 2 keys.  It took 1 month to get the 2nd key and then about a week to program it.
Aside from that, my experience at Peter Pan BMW  was first-class and I recommend asking for Doug Miller if you have the chance.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>My review is specifically about my awesome sales people Adam and Jay.  They were kind, friendly, responsive, reasonable, and all around great people.  Adam took time out from his vacation to make sure that I got my car - texting back and forth with me on his day off to ensure that my customer experience was amazing.  Jay took me on a drive during rush hour and detailed all the distinguishing features of the model I was buying - again, a really pleasant experience.  It's true that technically, you purchase a car from a company, but ultimately, it's the actual person that sells you the car that makes or breaks your experience.  I lucked out by having Adam and Jay as my sales people.  Very good experience.</text></record>

Incredibly worst customer service from the sales department. I have been trying to boom a simple pre-inspection appt., for a few days now and have been transferred from one person to another. Today I called again and was transferred to a very rude
Individual just to tell me that there is not appt needed and its only open from M-F no weekends because they cant get others to work on the weekends. Then he rudely says we are selling cars lady... Well thank YOU Peter Pan Sales Rep you just made my decision to NOT do any more business with you much easier.< /text>

Fantastic place, great customer service!”
This dealership was top notch! Henry Sipor went above and beyond to make sure I purchased the car I was most comfortable with. He gave me suggestions and his advice, but was in no way pushy what-so-ever. After I decided on a vehicle the process was absolutely painless. So quick and professional. I felt like family by the end of the whole process! I would recommend Henry Sipor to anyone who is looking for a new or used vehicle.< /Review>

< Review>
At first i was reluctant to bring my car to any BMW service because of the prices  but i have no choice because it needs BMW certified mechanic to replace my steering column and program the car. The experience was more than EXCELLENT!! Kudos to Roberto Ronquillo for his outstanding knowledgeable great service. He made me feel comfortable, appreciated and made sure i get taken care of by providing me a loaner car, he made my day! I will definitely recommend Peter Pan BMW Service to my friends and colleagues. Thank you for a great service!!<//Review>

Arrogant sales team that treats you like you're lucky to be in their building. The salesman was unbearable. I purchased a car anyway, and accidentally left about $200 in items in my trade-in. I called later that day and was assured he would hold the items for me. When I called the next day to set a time to come in and retrieve the items, my salesman told me the car (and items) was already gone, and proceeded to berate me for leaving the items in the car to begin with. I was so upset I called his manager, got his message machine, and left a detailed message explaining what had happened, but he never bothered to return my call. These people are absolutely AWFUL at customer service, and it clearly comes from the top on down. That was the last BMW I've purchased.</Text>

<rate>1<//rate><review>During first meet, the service rep that’s “helping” me to get my boss’s i3 serviced outright refused to provide me with a loaner car and blamed it on some divine power that’s beyond him (some les he didn’t even name and blamed on). First try, ok I get it, “the owner of the vehicle has to be present”. Second time when I called the loaner car service again about it, the loaner department passed me to the same person again, and like the BOSS he is that seemed to control all service department, told me flat no again because my boss has a international driver’s license. Then, when I asked if there’s another other way, he put me on hold for about less than a minute, and then told me flat NO again! Well, hello, how did my boss got a car at Peter Pan the first place? And is legally driving in the state of California with his seemingly “non-legitimate” international driver’s license?

When you work in the service sector, the worst thing you can do is tell your customer, or person directly related to your customer a big “NO”. That’s the end of my fuss and I now have a bad taste with Peter Pan BMW. With that been said, I personally would not and also, would not recommend anyone I know to get their bmw serviced here.

Update:
I had talked with individual, and understood that it's solely his company's policy. I feel bad singling him out, when instead it's only Peter Pan I need to be venting on.</review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1567003488656, 'text': 'Mark,\n\nI can assure that our staff treats all guests with the same level of respect and dignity.

First class service! Wai Wong, the advisor, did an excellent job coordinating both my regular car service and the body shop insurance job. I don't have to wait for a few more days without a loaner car for the insurance company's arrangement of glass replacement. Very happy that I choose to service here at Peter Pan.<//Review>

Oliver is awesome!  When I came in with my oil change coupon he said he could do better and did.  This kind of honest, sincere treatment started a discussion with my wife about our next car.

I would have given it a zero star if there is an option.  We walked in after exchanging emails on x5 the day before, and confirmed that it was ready.  We looked at one fully loaded X5 and we liked it well enough to give it a spin.   Then we were told  it could not be driven due to lack of gas, only to be "admired" on a static base...... After we politely indicated that we would buy only after test drive, we were told to wait for the car with gas to show up and  of course it didn't.   After 20 minutes we left.   Such episode left us wondering about the truth: Was it really waiting on gas or it was just not necessary, under the assumption that we could not afford it.    BTW,  this will be  our 3rd BMW and we will buy elsewhere.</review>

<Text>Definitely the most efficient and most pleasant car buying experience we've had.
We worked with Victor and I'd highly recommended him.

We've been trying to buy a new car for a while. We did our research on the Internet and knew the going price for the car we wanted.  But when we talked to two other dealers in the Bay Area, they either try to charge us more than the market rate or was really slow moving

Last weekend, we happened to be in Redwood City, and we decided to drop by to see if Peter Pan is any different.  We spoke with Victor Hung.  He's super busy and he runs (not walks) in the office.  He was busy helping another customer but he asked us a couple of quick questions and give us a couple of cars in stock to look at while waiting.  When we wanted to leave, he told us he'd be with us in 5 mins, he kept his promise.

We quickly narrowed down to 2 cars, and we decided to go with the car in stock.  He knew we did our home work, so we only had to go back and forth once, and we had a deal.  After we agreed on the price, he talked to his GM for a minute to confirm, and that was it.  Not the usual business of keeping you waiting for hours and going back and forth to the manager.

And after we decided to buy, we told him our company might have a corporate employee discount.  He tried very hard to find us the additional info so we can get the corporate discount.

All in all the best experience we've had in buying a car so far!< /Text>< Pics>

<review>I would stay away from this location.

I test drove a vehicle here that I really liked and I was interested in buying it. But when I asked a simple question about BMW services that were disabled on the car, the sales guy started avoiding the conversation and told me that all BMW dealerships have the same policy and treated me with contempt - I actually checked with other dealers and found that it was not the case.

So, my advice is to keep your dignity and avoid such people altogether. The sales guys here shrug you off when they have no answers as if they have no interest in making a sale.

There are better car dealers out there!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1477447996109, 'text': "Vineet,\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your recent experience. However, the client advisor you spoke with was correct in informing you of the BMW campaign to disconnect the BMW Assist technology within the vehicle you inquired about.

For the past couple of months, I have been looking to lease a new BMW.  I am happy to report now that I had a very pleasant experience leasing a new vehicle from Peter Pan BMW, dealing with the Fleet manager Henry Sipor. Henry is an experienced, professional Fleet manager with a very pleasant manner.  After a stress-free agreement on the terms over the phone with Henry, it took less than 30 minutes to get the paperwork completed and pick up the vehicle.
This is not my first BMW lease, and I am glad to see that Peter Pan BMW and Henry Sipor have kept up the BMW professional tradition. I highly recommend dealing with Henry and I'll definitely be back to see him when the time comes for my next upgrade.<//text>

I had an appointment with Peter Galanakis to shop for my first BMW.  Right away Peter made me feel very comfortable as I had absolutely no experience with this type vehicle.  After doing some internet searching I was in the market for a 5 series.  Peter explained the benifits of the 5 and took my wife and I on test drive.  This was the first time I had ever driven a BMW, he explained how the car works and all the functions that were available.  After returning to the dealership we sat down and Peter walked us through the process of "building" our car.  Once that was completed he explained the process of placing an order for the exact car we wanted.

My wife and I wanted to come home and think about this purchase.  After thinking this though we decided to make the purchase.  I contacted Peter and we met again.  He again was extremely helpful in explaining what our next steps were and we order our 540I.

Upon delivery of the car Peter took the time to demonstrate many of the features of the car before we took it home.  He also recommended that we drive the car for a few weeks and then contact him and he would set us up with one of their geniuses who would be able to explain in better detail the workings of our particular car.

I highly recommend Peter Pan BMW and Peter Galanakis if you are interested in a BMW.< /Text>

This is the only Bay area bimmer repair shop I'll goto even though I live in SF. John DePalma is my favorite service writer and had gone to bat for me a bunch of times to get things fixed with BMW of NA. Solid shop. Not to mention Bob and Tom at the parts counter are knowledgeable and really nice guys. This has been my shop for 6+ years and I don't plan on going elsewhere. BMW of SF are pretentious twits.</text>

<review>I was really impressed with the used Subaru that I purchased from here today, however, I really am left with a sour taste about my experience. I looked at the car prior to the detailing and everything was beautiful with no exterior damage. Later after detailing I noticed a scuff right in the front that was shockingly obvious. I do not know a lot about cars, but had a feeling this just happened with the detailing process and when I stated this concern the salesman Norm stated it was not. I was in a hurry to get home and agreed to a $200 discount and I was still pretty excited about car and price. After  I was home I took to body shop and they stated that this was damage due to buffing too close and they had put wax over it to try and cover it up- worse off, very expensive to fix.
I have to say that I was really happy with everything, Norm was nice and so was the rest of the staff, and the car is great, but now I can only notice this scuff that was not there prior to the detailing.
Having said that I would advise taking pictures of your car prior to any work, and do not let them detail the car as they have inexperienced people doing this.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Horrible customer service. I've brought my car in for 3rd time complaining about extremely high pitch loud squeal coming from the front brakes. The noise is so loud that people across the street turn to see where it is coming from. My neighbor asked me what's wrong with the brakes because he keeps hearing them in the morning when I leave for work.

The SA and her manager kept telling me that's "normal" for performance brakes that BMW uses and refuse to do anything to fix the root cause. The manager David Brom just told me to take it with corporate as they won't let him replace parts to fix the problem. Called corporate they told me to go back to the dealer. They were just passing the responsibility back and forth and not taking ownership to fix an obvious issue. Keep in mind the car is under warranty.

After some research it turns out I wasn't the only one with this issue however BMW doesn't care and hides behind a piece of paper issued stating that it is normal to have noise brake. I've owned many other cars including Audi and Mercedes and none of them had this horrible problem of brake squeal. BMW let me down and certainly didn't provide the "ultimate driving machine" experience as they claim to be. Can't wait for warranty to be gone so I can take it to competent shop that will take care of the problem instead of Peter Pan refusing to acknowledge there is one.< /text>

<review>Extremely poor service experience, they called me to “squeeze” me in the Friday after Tgiving, I just needed headlights adjusted and oil change. When I delivered the car and received the loaner, all very efficient, the service advisor indicated it would be late in the day, I objected and made clear I wanted the car back earlier.  Off I went, later around 1:30 I received a text that they would need the car until Sat. possibly Mon. This after they called me.  After multiple attempts to get the advisor and a threat to call the Service mgr. the advisor answered and was clear they needed the car until Monday, I demanded my car back, picked it up late Friday, a complete waste of time.  No apology, in fact nothing, my car was just sitting out front, I got the keys and left.  This is all about Peter Pan and filling their schedule, the customer’s needs or wishes are secondary. BTW the customary follow up “how did we do “ never happened.  If you take your car to Peter Pan, plan on at least a complete day,  for busy people it is a hassle, the next time I buy a car, service will be a much more serious part of the equation.<//review><Rating>1<//Rating><Gmap_id>0x808f9efc33be4f95:0xc1b7f19c392f036a<//Gmap_id>< Date>

went on a Tuesday - kinda raining around 10:16am and alot of customers already. Waited for 40mins but when I followed up, they are nothing but courteous. From Gus to Michele to Willy/Robert, all of my interaction is nothing but world-class. This is my first BMW service and it all exceeded my expectations. Love it and thank you<//review>

<text>It was a very good experience. My car died on the street one evening.  I got it towed to Peter pan next day.  Steve helped me.  He not only provided accurate diagnosis of the problem,  kept me informed and updated,  but also provided other very helpful advice. They also offered a loaner,  although I didn't need it. They are also very honest . My carhad problem due to fuel pump malfunction. They offered extended warranty so didn't even charge me.  When I picked up mycar,  it was washed and internal vaccumed. Overall,  it was Avery good experience.<//text>< Pics>

It is great dealership for servicing your car. You will spend minimal time and get great service. Very courteous people have real interest to keep you satisfied. You will get also perfect loaner car or shuttle service. However do not go there to buy or lease a car. It is just waste time unless you do not care how much you pay. People there will tell you lying all time. A typical example a friend of mine went there and got a quote for a car and still had room for negotiation, so when I came there 2 hours after they gave me quote $2,000 more and swear they sell it for no profit. I hate such behavior. So go to East Bay BMW to get real price without ripping off.< /Text>

Excellent service. Service advisor (Steve) was really helpful and informed me about a class action lawsuit on my car and inspected and made changes to the car for me. Replaced a part under recall without me prompting for it.
10/10 in terms of service.</Review>

I highly recommend the service department at BMW  Peter Pan generally and Wai Wong my advisor specially. I was stressed with my car had so many issues that needed to be fixed and Wai Wang did an amazing job giving me the best deal, following up with me about the repair and making sure that the car came out of service in the best possible shape.
On top of that she provided me with amazing courtesy black convertible car !!!!< /text>

I had an annoying rattle on my 2017 BMW and had the pleasure of having Oliver Vinluan as my service advisor, he is the ultimate professional he kept me informed about the status of my repair. His team found and fixed my rattle issue and Oliver also followed up the next day to see if the rattle returned, which it did not. I would highly recommend and trust bringing my car to him if I ever have future issues. Thank you Oliver.< /Text>

Mr. Javed Ahmadzai at Peter Pan BMW had done a wonderful job from end to end, and he made everything so easy for us on purchasing our first X1. His sincere customer service certainly earned the 5-star rating from us. The staffs who helped us test driving and processing the finance paperwork were also excellent. Their knowledge and service were superb. Overall, this purchase experience really exceeds our expectation.

We called few dealers around to find the car my wife was looking for. At the end we decided to visit the nearest dealer to us to test drive. We were introduced to fleet manager Henry Sipor at PeterpanBMW. Not that long, my wife was happy driving her new car home. Happy wife, happy life, right?

My wife and I went there basically just to inform ourselfes about the car market here in CA, since we both are from germany. However, we ended buying a car. Everyone was super helpful and very informative, the car we got is in excellent condition. Special thanks to Adam Locke who helped us throughout the process. It was a great pleasure!< /text>

I had one of the best shopping experience of  a car from a Peter Pan BMW Eugene Masalitin was a fantastic sales person to work with. He went above and beyond to suggest and test drive several vehicles to compare and make the right choice.

Thank you once again. Definitely coming back when the lease is over.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>My husband and I went to this dealership just to look for a car and we were lucky to meet Henry Sipor. Make the long story short we left the dealership happy and content and didn't feel like we were forced into anything . They even washed the car or wax not sure before giving it to me and a full tank of gas . Henry worked very hard to stay with in our budget and actually cared for us and what we needed,no wonder he had a full Cadenza of trophies and letters,can't say good enough things about Henry and Peterpan BMW. I bought the car I wanted and more and walked away happy and content. Anyone in a market for a car go visit the dealership and ask for him by name, you won't be sorry.
Ps they also took care of my lease return without a headache. Thank you to Henry and Peterpan BMW.< /review>< gmap_id>

Was in the market for an SUV, checked out multiple brands and eventually bought one from Peter Pan BMW, San Mateo. Javed Ahmadzai who was our Sales consultant went above and beyond throughout the entire process!

We went in after doing some homework and I can confidently say that there was no BS from start to finish - he was honest, to the point and made the process a breeze. Highly recommend pinging Javed if you are in the market for a new car!

Overall: Very happy with my new car, Javed and his buddy Shak (in the finance department)!< /text>

<text>Worst internet sales experience ever! No matter how many times I asked about the vehicle I was interested in nobody that emailed me provided any information. I tried calling a few times too. Eventually I got someone who rudely informed me that vehicle didn't pass their safety inspection and it was sent to auction. Even though I have now been told it is not available I have still received emails asking if I am still interested in the vehicle I asked about. No matter what I say or email nobody seems to listen or care. I will never go to this car dealership EVER!</text>< time>

If you considered Peter Pan BMW to buy your next car from, I definitely recommend you look for Adam Locke who is an agile, helpful,  experienced and honest representative I had the privilege to support me during the end-to-end buying process. I really felt like a VIP while negotiating and closing our family's car deal!<//review>

<Text>I am not sure what qualifications these guys ask for when hiring sales representatives. The guy who helped me (or lack there of) was a total douch-bag. He was manipulative, and lacked the information I needed. He was just a sales rep. (and a bad one of that), but acting as he is owning the BMW brand or is the CEO of it.

I ended up taking my business elsewhere purely because of the strange experience I got there. Got my new BMW from BMW of Mountain View (much much better experience, very helpful and informative).
Try to stay away from the guy, or rather this dealership entirely who hired him.</Text>< gmapID>

I usually don't give one star review. But this time I have to.
I did a maintenance two month back at Peter Pan BMW. They helped me replaced my wind shield wiper. I didn't really paid attention to it since in California summer there is no rain. Then recently when cleaning the window I realized that the left blade is not fully attaching to the wind shield, thus not able to wipe it clean. Having no idea what's wrong (I even started to wonder if they really give me a new wiper during maintenance) I headed there to take a look. Then the advisor told me that "even if they put a new blade on, it's not fully attaching", and they think the wiper arm was bent and need to be replaced. They gave me a $200 quote for the arm replacement. Of course I am not convinced of their saying. So I went home, put the right blade on to the left arm and IT IS attaching. So how could they say that even if they put on a new blade it's the same??!! At the end I bent the blade a little bit and now it's fixed. I am surprised by the unprofessionalism and jump-to-conclusion approach they are taking. Totally disappointed.<//text>

Came in to check out some BMWs. I wanted to lease one but didn’t know which one. I got introduced to the client advisor Javed Ahmadzai. He was very patient and helpful. I ended up leaving but then called him and scheduled an appointment. Car after car and looking at the vast inventory of PeterPan BMW I finally got the color I wanted. It was all because of he was very patient, knowledgeable and understanding. I would definitely recommend Javed Ahmadzai my friends and family.</Text>

I've bought two BMWs from Peter Pan - one when it was privately owned and also from its new corporate owner, Penske Automotive Group.  The first was fine.  The second time, involved a couple of thousand dollars they stole from me as part of the car I returned on lease.  The car had a 45,000 mileage limit on it, I returned it with 32,000, and 4 pin-head sized pits in the lower part of the windshield.

They charged me $2,000 for the windshield and wear and tear when the car was returned in an almost near new state.  I sued in small claims court and won the first round.  They've appealed and we are going back for round #2 which they will lose too.  I'm in the process of contacting Channel 7 'On Your Side' and will continue to leave lovely reviews of them here and on Yelp.  :)

Do yourself a favor and buy your BMW elsewhere.  I've owned 5 now and will never return to this outfit.  Can you believe management would let them steal $2k in this market with the damage this does to their reputation?

<text>My wife and I just picked up our second X5 from Bob Giarrusso last night.  It was great to see Bob and the team there again (Sales Manager Rob, F&I guy Shak, and GM Jim) and the remodel is amazing!  The process has always been simple and open faced and both times my wife and I visited the dealer just to sign and drive our new car home.  Great service and follow-up and of course a great deal each time without hassles or games.

When we purchased our first one in 2009, we lived in San Jose and have since moved to Marin - so we are driving past multiple BMW dealers each time to buy from Bob and the team at Peter Pan.  If you are looking to purchase a BMW I strongly recommend that you find out for yourself why it's worth the time to visit and buy from them in San Mateo.<//text><name>James Chou<//name>< gmapID>

<Review>Absolutely the worst leased return experience ever!
Had me waited over two hours for a 10 mins process. Keith was the guy to in charge of this and because I am not getting another car this time he purposely has me waited over two hours and when I told him that's the worst experience I ever had. Jim who sits next to him jump in the conversation and told me to return the car elsewhere if I am not happy!
Unbelievable!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

In the market for a BMW M4. Worked with Peter Galanakis, sales.
Everything below is factual:
- 11/24 brought in my 2009 Porsche 911 4S to get an estimate
- car was evaluated at 20% less than what Carlsen Porsche, Autobahn motors or the Tesla folks offered
- I bought three other cars from Peter Pan BMW. The first in 2001 - X5, second in 2002 - 530i, third in 2006 - 330i

The question is whether the folks at BMW are honest in their business practice? You decide.
My decision - steer clear from them.<//text>

These guys are complete scums when it comes to lease return.   We had trouble with them 3 years ago when we planned to purchase our X6.   That's the reason we ended up leasing/buying our vehicles from Alexanders in LA.
Beware they write up all sorts of stuff.   They don't follow any BMW lease end guidelines.   We noticed that with BMW Dingometer you're charged only for dings an scratches over 2 inches.   But they will ask you sit back while they will go around and write up even 1/2 inch scratches and put round numbers like $400, $800 for each.  Just literally whatever comes to their mind.    They write up stuff that's tiny  dents and marks on the bottom portion of the front bumper, which we have no control over stones and debris hitting them.     They will lie to you every which way, before until they get you to sign the lease end contract and after the contract is signed, they will tell you nothing is covered, and your coverage or protection you have won't work.    I think the dealership trains them specially for this type of actions.   We have leased BMWs  in the past and had little or no issues returning leases.   I mean if this is what they do to customers who buy high end models, we can only imagine what kind of con they pull on others.   We also saw other lease return reviews here and not surprised.  Unfortunately it was a little close to our lease end date and we didn't much time in resorting back to our LA dealer, who literally told us to truck it to them at little to no cost.
Another con, they pull is that if they do a previous inspection  and rack up charges and you challenge them and get it fixed, they would find new things to charge on when you fix the vehicle and bring it back for return.   They have a number in their head for your vehicle (obviously using bmw sales people to get lease returns is like guarding the hen coop with a fox) and they want to get that out from you.  So they keep marking stuff on your car, until it meets that number .  You try to fix that and bring it back, they will find new things to meet that number.   We have seen nothing of this sort.
To make it worse, we took the vehicle for service and they dinged the side of the vehicle.   We found that our on the 2nd inspection and they wrote us up on that too!!
WARNING AND ADVISE TO LEASEE'S:   Our advise for lease returns is to be with these guys and watch out carefully on what they write up for.  Do the pre-inspection and don't sign any final contract.   Get inspection from other independent agents.   Otherwise they would tell you everything you need to believe, until the last inspection, they will literally write up  They will tell you everything is fine and your coverage will take care of stuff, until you sign the  inspection.   Once it's done, then all bets of off.   Nothing they say will be the truth.   Don't trust a thing.   Better do you own research and check your original contract and coverages.
It's bunch of greedy sales guys who have nothing better to do who take in these lease returns.   Both the sales manager Jim and rob Jensen they work hand in hand in making this happen.  Which means you can guess what anyone else who's taking the return will do when the managers do this scam.    Obviously it's not a sale, and they get nothing, so they use their usual charming sales tactics  in lease return to lie and lie and get to a point you've gotten to a place of no return.

If you're tired of dealers like this like we do, just get your BMWs from LA just like us and return it to them.  Alexanders imports literally gets our vehicle leases to our front door from LA and takes the leased car back , no hassles.  That's why they're rated 4+ stars everywhere and stand high on BMW NA unlike any other scamming dealership here.</text>

Peter Pan BMW is authorized by BMW Financial Services to conduct inspections on their behalf. We are able to perform these inspections as a courtesy to any clients regardless of the lease origination dealer and without the need for an appointment. We are held to the highest of standards for such inspections as set forth by BMW Financial Services. Unfortunately, the amounts of the charges outlined in the lease inspection are set by BMW Financial Services and are not able to be adjusted by any dealer performing the inspection. I do understand your frustration with the 3rd party Lease Wear/Tear policy you purchased as part of your lease. This unfortunate difference in opinion with BMW Financial Services guidelines is why we have eliminated any 3rd party financial products offered with our leases and ONLY offer BMW Financial Services products.

Not a trustworthy dealer at all !
Very disappointing experience while making deal with sales agent Mr. Dmitriy Shamilov. He called himself an internet sales agent but he has negative level of skills on how to deal with customers.
I was contacted this Peter Pan BMW to buy X1 model and Mr. Dmitriy Shamilov was my point of contact for my purchase. We made all purchase deal with email conversation and finally made a appointment to buy the vehicle.
However, When I went to dealership to buy the vehicle he totally disagreed on what he promised to me. He started saying me he didn't reply my email but when i showed his reply then he was totally nervous and said me that let me talk to his manager. He lost for few minutes, After back he said we can't sale this vehicle now for what he promised to me. OOPS MOMENT !!!
And he made a new quote at high price, he totally forgot what he made conversation with me on email and what he promised for.
I can say this sales person Dmitriy Shamilov and Peter Pan BMW don't have business integrity and don't care his customers and try to make customers fool. VERY BAD!!!< /text>

<text>What can I possibly say about these scumbags that isn't already mentioned.  I've owned BMWs exclusively for over a decade and I've been to dealerships all over the country.  Nowhere will you find such incompetence than here.

I brought in my 2012 335i for a maintenance and an infrequent "Powertrain Malfunction".  It wasn't a big deal, it just popped up, you'd pull over, stop, restart....  it's going great.  This happened once or twice in a few months time.  I chalked it up to some recall or electronics or even getting some bad gas.  (Though, always premium.)

Cut to months later, I can barely drive the car 20 miles without it coming up.  And the car goes into limp mode when it happens, so on the freeway, I gotta maneuver out of the way.  Bring it in...  they all but call me a liar.  Finally, after getting video, they offer me $2k off the purchase of a new car.  You can get better than that on the website.  However, they never failed to try and upsell me when I was in on a service.  And, despite their dogged troubleshooting techniques, they never drove the car more than 1-3 miles.  Really bang up job guys.

To top it all off, I just want rid of this thing so I barely drive it for 9 months just waiting for the lease to expire.  I finally get the option to turn it in early, at my own cost, for the problems their warranty should have fixed.  But I was just sick of taking off work to go get it and deal with them.  On the way to literally drop the car off, it dies completely.

I was told by their "General Sales Manager" that there was nothing that would be done.  They didn't honor their warranty...  oh well.  And proceeded to try and sell me another.  Unbelievable.

The real shame is that it was a wonderful car until this.  And I've been a loving owner of so many for so long.  Now they just have me looking at other companies.

Well, that's enough for me.  I needed a hobby.  And my new hobby is telling everyone how terrible Peter Pan is.  Shouldn't be hard.</text>< UserId.>

<review>No one likes it when their car is 6-months out of warranty, then breaks down.  My 530i broke down on the freeway on the way home from San Francisco airport after a long business trip.  Water pump failure right after the car turned 100,000 miles (extended warranty).  I had my car towed to the nearest BMW dealer which turned out to be Peter Pan BMW.  I had never been there before.  Despite this, I was treated VERY well.  I had an absolutely great service advisor (Roel Vela); he helped get me a loaner vehicle and got my car into the maintenance queue late on a Friday afternoon right before a holiday weekend.  He was later very helpful in explaining exactly what went wrong, how much it would cost to repair, and kept me informed what my repair options were.  I think Mr. Roel Vela represented Peter Pan and BMW very well. I'd highly recommend their service department and especially, Roel.  Great service.< /review>< Response>

<Review>I purchased my BMW Certified Pre-owned 2012 Z4 from Peter Pan BMW in September 2015.  I noticed the front bumper had popped out from its plastic clips while it was parked in our garage a few days later.  We decided to wait until the first service to have these clips replaced.
Six months later while having my Z4 in for regular service, I brought to the attention of the service center mechanic the problem with my bumper constantly popping out, thinking it might need just clips replaced. They looked at it and suggested I bring the car back to the sales department.  I called and asked to speak to someone who could take a look at the problem.  Unfortunately it did not go as well as I would have expected.  Sales rep. Keith Ray was immediately defensive, accusative and downright condescending with me, blaming me for the damage and he never even looked at the car.  I then met with the sales Manager, Rob Rensen and he looked at bumper, but never once popped the hood open.  He said he would bring this up to the General Manager Jim Cyr for Peter Pan BMW and Rob asked that I call him back a few days later, which I did and left a voicemail.  I then called again the following week – still no call back.  I emailed him directly and still no response.   Finally I got a hold of Rob over the phone a few weeks later only to give me the news that there is nothing that can be done because I waited too long to call back.
So much for the BMW certified Pre-Owned BMW program.  It is supposed to have been inspected by a BMW trained technician, but somehow they missed a few details, the biggest was the bracket that holds the front bumper, as it was almost failing when they sold it and did not want to stand behind their own car.
I took my BMW to my own certified mechanic and he ordered parts needed, it was a simple part replacement and not a complete replacement of the front bumper which is what Kevin and Rob presumed.   All it took was someone with some brains and a genuine interest in their customer to open the hood and really do a thorough check to find it was a simple inexpensive bracket replacement, in this case less than $30 dollars plus the labor to replace it.
I can live with that small cost to repair my car.  I am still very proud of it, but what I can't live with is the thought that others will be treated in pretty much the same way I was.  No one and I mean no one should be treated in a condescending and rude manner ever.
This is no way to conduct and/or run a business.  I won’t be taking my BMW to Peter Pan BMW as they have shown very clearly where they stand - a lack of basic knowledge and a lack of professional courtesy.<//Review><userid>113139903466973762584< /userid><name>Yazmin Martinez< /name><Response>None<//Response><Pictures>None< /Pictures><gmapID>0x808f9efc33be4f95:0xc1b7f19c392f036a<//gmapID></record>

< Review>
I droppped my 2007 328i in for service on Saturday. On monday I got a call from John DePalma, that my car was ready. Michelle Gladieux greeted me when I got to the counter with friendliness and professionalism. I have been servicing my car there for many years, and Michelle has always been that smiling face of the service department. And thanks to John, everything was performed as promised and on time. I highly recommend Peter Pan BMW if you need to service your car. If it wasn't for the excellent treatment I received, I would not waste my time in writing a review. But I believe they deserve it.<//Review>

<text>****Roel Vela!**** - he is my service adviser and also assistant service manager - he is so great!  He treats me as if I purchased the Z8 new (I purchased a CPO Z4 8 years ago!) - this whole establishment treats you with respect and honestly, like a friend.  You are greeted with a smile, escorted to the lobby where you can get hot coffee and a snack (if you have to wait at all) or if you don't have to wait, you can get it afterwards....there is a very clean and wonderful restroom as well - then your wonderful service adviser comes to get you (in my case ****Roel Vela****) and your car is whisked away for the care that only a mother could give (every BMW is treated like family here)  - the loaner cars are fabulous and the adviser (ROEL!) makes sure to call you and give you updates on your car - done or not, waiting on parts, nothing wrong with the car etc...I love Peter Pan BMW and their excellent service by every adviser I've ever had there - my next purchase of a car will DEFINITELY be a BMW!  Thank you Peter Pan BMW!</text>< gmap_id>

<Review>We are california auto upholstery , along with legacy auto and San carlos tech. we worked on this vehicle to figure what bmw could not, BMW car has mat sensor problems, its a computer, not the mat, they claim we did a bad installation, wrong, their computer said bad mat sensor, its actually inside.. bmw manufactor problems, we send like $800 to buy 2 mat sensor.
Name that works there .
Brooke service manager
David , i think, incopetent technitioan,
they call them selfs, bmw specialist, they know it all,  they should actually go back to school and learn a little more.
btw my name is Martin and I work at california auto, Dont take it to Bmw never, even if you are the richest man on earth, take it to bmw indy specialist ...
like in san carlos tech, or legacy,.
it's sad we all have to write bad reviews
but Mr. brooke and tech David, please ya'll shall quit, custer is always right with prooves and everything and you still insist customer is wrong,
ya'll just replace parts thats's all you know what to do, you dont know how to fix diagnose the parts by hand and brain,
your brain is a computer,
yes this is personal .....thanks for hanging up the phone on me  such a great customer service, can't hold it when someone tells you  guys that you diagnose wrong and want to avoid any return,,
this is more than you need.<//Review>< pics>

Unorganized, cars dirty with pitch and bird droppings. Don't they clean all that off before the show them in the lot. Shows laziness and that is not professional. Called ahead and it still took over 25 minutes for our car, even though it was "ready". Hum, not so good.</review>

<Review>I wanted to buy a BMW (new one) from these guys. My God, this car dealer has the worst customer service I have ever seen. No one attends to you, no one cares when you are looking for help or have questions, super arrogant attitude! The sales people are rude and impolite!

I had the most amazing car buying experience with Henry Sipor at Peter Pan BMW in San Mateo. When I first walked in, I wasn't even sure if I was going to buy a car from there on that day. But after a brief chat with Henry not only he helped me find the perfect car that fit all my parameters, but also he went above and beyond to help me get the best deal and best overall value I wouldn't find anywhere. Trust me I had been looking and observing the market for weeks prior.

Like most people, I always dreaded to spend my entire day buying a car from a large dealership and deal with a lot of haggling and arm-wrestling with the sales team, managers, etc. However, every aspect my interaction with Henry was on point and centered around my needs, my budget and ideal payment terms. He made sure every single question I raised was taken care of to my full-satisfaction. He absolutely good at what he does. He engaged the right parties to help me and his entire team offered my the best customer service one can possibly expect from a premium auto dealership.

In addition to his professionalism, Henry is such an intelligent and interesting man, not only I enjoyed his effortless handling of my car buying experience in a matter of a couple of hours, but also thoroughly enjoyed to chat with him about his background, knowledge, wisdom and utterly positive outlook at life. It's been several days, since I purchased the car, but I am still on the clouds enjoying my car and positive experience I had with wonderful Henry Sipor. If you are in the market for new or used BMW cars, do yourself a favor and go see Henry. He'll make sure you leave Peter Pan BMW as a happy new owner of another ultimate driving machine! :)</review>

(Translated by Google) In order to buy a car, I went to many car dealers. After comparing all aspects, I chose to buy it at peter pan bmw. Ivy Wong & Victor Hung are really the best dealer I have ever seen. They are very sincere and can feel it. The price and attitude are impeccable. Very recommended, if you need to buy a car, it is good to find Ivy and Victor, they can speak Chinese very convenient.
