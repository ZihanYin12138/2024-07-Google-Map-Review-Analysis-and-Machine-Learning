TLDR: Came for a 3 day tire change and THEY DAMAGED MY CAR with no compensation.

I come with a simple tire change. On the phone, the person helping me assured me that they had a tire in stock and to swing by first thing in the morning to pick up the car. I come after work and they haven't done anything. They order the tire and tell me to come back the next day.
I come back and the tire work was done, but I find my car HAS BEEN DAMAGED. My diver side mirror was broken. I promptly complain to the workers at the front desk and they tell me that the tech who worked on the car was not available and offered no kind of compensation.

For anything besides tire changes don't go here. I needed a simple part replaced and I made an appointment 5 days in advance.

When I showed up that day, they realized they had ordered the wrong part. I didn't complain because accidents happen. They said that they would have the part the next morning by 9am, I called at 8am to confirm this, and they said that our appointment was on for 9am. I gave them an extra hour and showed up at 10 , I got there and they had no clue where the part was or when it was arriving.

Mind you this was a standard OEM part that was in stock. They are not professional and have no regard for other people's time.< /text>

Called on 1/27/21 to book an appointment for 1/30/21 @ 8am.  Showed up to location on day of appointment and the place was closed with a sign on the door saying closed until 2/6/21. Is it too much to expect a business to call you if they need to cancel your appointment and all services for whatever reason? A phone call would have been nice. What a waste of time.< /review>

I ordered a tire a week in advance and made an appointment to have it installed. When I showed up, they told the shipment was late and I had to wait another 45 minutes which would’ve been okay. They told me to come back in one hour. 2 hours later I came back and they didn’t even start working on the car yet. They could’ve called to update me. No respect for people’s time and I don’t want to keep waiting around especially with the current pandemic.<//Text>

<Review>This has been my go-to car repair shop for over 10 years. They recently moved to this location from San Mateo at El Camino. They have excellent service and friendly staff.  At one point my car light went out and they accepted me right within the hour.

Today my Honda lights all went on. I went in and was helped by Eric. He told me about promotions and discounts they had going on saved me some money. This is the awesome type of service I have come to expect. Love this place.< /Review>< Pictures>

Had a great experience here today; I was a bit nervous before going, after reading some of the reviews, but didn't have much choice as nothing nearby was open on the weekends.

I had a flat tire, and called ahead to ask if I could have my car towed there--the woman on the phone was very helpful and friendly and said to bring it on over, and that they actually have my size tire in stock. In the past at other shops I've had to wait several days because my tire needed to be ordered (Smart car), so that was a nice surprise.

When I got there she was up-front about costs and honest about how long it'd take. I walked home thinking I probably wouldn't have my car back today, but 2 hours later she called to tell me it was ready! Very happy customer, and I'd definitely go back again if necessary.<//Text>

<text>Terrible experience!

One week after getting my car checked for $200, my engine overheated in Southern California and had to pay an extra $400 to get it fixed.

They had suggested a few things I needed fixed with my car that would cost around $2k. I decided to not go ahead with those changes and was told my car would still drive fine.

I came back to try and see if they could refund some of the work but they weren't interested whatsoever & blamed it on me not going through with the 2k reparations.

Customer service was also terrible.

"It's on the way" and would be "another 30 minutes".  It's 45 minutes later and still no word from them.

They have my contact info, should have told me it would be later than 3pm.  Should have let me know it also would miss the second 30 minute window, as I was pretty upset and told them to call me.

They are understaffed, and I understand that it would take longer than usual.  But setting these expectations and still missing them is unacceptable.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Terrible service.  In the morning, told me they had all needed tires in stock.  Then told me at 1 pm car would be done by the end of the day.  Then at 6 pm, I called for them to tell me they only had three tires.  No one called me.  I was told their inventory does not work properly.< /review>

<Date>1600614234180<//Date><Rate>1<//Rate><review>Our experience suggests this business is not trustworthy.  My wife asked them to repair her front right tire which had a slow leak because of a nail.  They called her a few hours later and told her the tire was not repairable (2 nails) and that she would need to buy 2 new tires at $298 each because the vehicle is all-wheel-drive (the difference in tread depth between a new tire and the existing tire was only 2/32").  We declined the work and were charged $30 for their attempted repair and for putting on the spare tire.  As we were driving away I discovered they didn't put the damaged tire back in the vehicle.  I had to go back and ask for it.

The following weekend we went to America's Tire in Redwood City for a second opinion because our experience with Wheel Works didn't feel right.  America's Tire tested the tire Wheel Works had repaired and told us it was fine.  They charged us zero for this service.  They said we didn't need to replace the tire, which incidentally was selling for $99 less at America's Tire.  The automobile dealer's service department also informed me we didn't need 2 new tires because the 2/32" difference in tread depth would not cause a mechanical problem with the car.  Our experience suggests Wheel Works was trying to "churn" business or take advantage of a woman and at the same time trying to keep (and probably resell) the tire that they repaired.

Forgot to mention the America's Tire tech told me the bolt holding the spare tire down inside the vehicle was bent as though someone tried to pull the tire out without realizing they had to first unscrew the bolt.  The only time the spare was ever touched was when Wheel Works removed it for the above repair.  Avoid this Wheel Works location.</review>< Pics>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>Left my truck there then they call 45 mins later saying they can’t fix screw in tire so I ask them to put on spare they say ok....I go pick it up walking of course it’s not done  They wasted my whole morning!!
I told them I will never go back to which they said good we don’t need customers like you to which I said good because I don’t need horrible work done like you do. They should have examined the tire when I initially brought it in!! Then they also should have told me it was 25 bucks to replace with spare. So I took it to general tire in Redwood City and they’re fixing it with a smile. Do not come here.</Text><rating>1</rating>< GmapID>

I had a bent  tire rim and brought a refurbished rim to replace it. The technician there discovered the replacement Rim I brought was also bent. Saving me money and time. Had another one shipped to me in 24 hours came back the Wheel Works and they install it for me. They did a good job.<//Text>

Shop around!!

They sales staff are great when you spend and will not serve the customer unless they benefit.

Do your homework, or else they will take advantage.

I have a Subaru AWD vehicle that I needed an emergency tire replaced till the other three (70% tread) were ready to be replaced.

Driving the Subaru (known to be AWD) no one said a thing when 1 tire was requested to be replaced.

I asked to have the tire unmounted so I can take my business elsewhere, because they did have a tire option in stock that I was comfortable with replaceing all 4 tires and they did not call me to give me options before they mounted the tire. The salesman told me he can not unmount the tire,  because the tire is considered used after been mounted on a rim. I felt trapped.

I was a customer for over 20 years.< /Review>

guys there are friendly and responsive, that's where the two stars come from.

But, the skill and knowledge of the engineers/workers in the shop are certainly to be improved.   I send my cars, one year old, to have alignment and balance,   the problem is a bit better but still there.  They said the tire pressure is way to high, almost 10ppi over and lower the pressure.   A couple of days later my cars tire warning light is on and I checked the ti is 6ppi lower than manufacture recommendation!    I lost my confidence in them.

I will try another Wheel Works store in the area.< /review>

I had with a misunderstanding with an employee  about an oil change and what i wanted. I didnt get what i paid for and i was told that i was wrong and wasnt clear about what i wanted. I was really upset and confused. Jeff had heared about the problem and called me first thing in the morning the next day. He really took time to listen to me and tell me that it should of been handled differently, and even though he called me super early and woke me up he really started my day off to a great start! This company very lucky to have him.< /text>

<Text>Took my car in for a wheel alignment. Get a call later on the day, stating an employed had backed another vehicle into mine. Rafel stated he already scheduled to get it repaired at EuroCraft Auto Body. How do I go from getting a wheel alignment to damaging my car?

I'm a returning customer. After this incident, sorry to say, but won't be coming back.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

It ended up almost taken three hours. As my truck waited outside for 15 minutes I stood at the counter when they continuously answered phone calls and ignoring me like I was invisible.I had to demand the keys for my truck so I could get the hell out of there. The short bald fat guy was unapologetic totally unprofessional. He didn't even do a tire rotation or put the sticker in the windshield.  Wheel works you suck.

Not only do you have to put extra quarters in to dry your clothes because the owner refuses to to clean the lint out of the dryers.

This was my first time at a laundromat and the staff were excellent help! They went over the process and helped me find the right machines for each wash load ( bed sheets, towels, clothes etc. )  I was doing. The place is clean. I highly recommend!< /text>

<Review>$2.50 for a top loader, 25 cents per 5 min on dryer.

Thought the dryer was a bit steep in price, most places I've been are 25 cents for 6 or 7 minutes.

Fairly clean and well organized facility. There's a sink and a bathroom for customers.</Review></record>

<text>I love this place for many reasons.

1. The machines are always clean
2. The laundromat is always clean
3. The prices are totally reasonable
4. They do an excellent job on your clothes
5. They open early and close late
6. The ladies that work here are very nice

<time>1502768800505< /time><text>Okay so the price is a dollar 75 per pound instead of a dollar 25 but who cares.  The one thing you really got to enjoy about this place is the people that work there I'm not going to kiss you if you're a man and you go in there you're going to love this place.  I came in there I was pretty much lost I didn't really know like where to take my clothes out or anything else like that and the dude was just let me hook you up and it was just like wow cool and you got my laundry waited all and you know what man the guy really did an awesome job.  Okay let me reiterate this the parking sucks okay let me say this again the parking sucks.!!!   But there's a Starbucks right next door and another convenience store just in case you want to get drunk while you doing laundry so that's all good to go and people Starbucks are surprisingly awesome I mean like it's like a neighborhood coffee shop a lot of regulars come in there a lot and they actually joke around wow it's almost man friendly!</text><GmapID>0x808e34f0586695af:0xc14e55a4722d3161</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Very clean and calm environment. Not too pricey. Nowhere to charge your phone
---

I've come here a few times now and every time there's at least one strange older man that feels the need to strike up useless or gross conversation.
One called me a b*tch because I ignored him. I didnt realize he was talking to me.
And even as I write this, the third guy this trip to bother me sat down next to me wreaking of piss and tried to touch me.

This is not under the laundromats control but it would be unfair for me to not include it in the rating of my experience here.< /text>

If this was 4 months ago, id be raving about Lucy's services. Now, it's a shame that when the boss is away that things can't seem to get done.  Very disappointing.  Same day and next day service goes out of the window. I would expect quality customer service regardless. If Lucy takes pride in her customer service and her business offering certain services, the entire team should know how to do the same. Every 4 months or so, I do laundry for an entire large apartment community. I have paid cash for great and speedy service. It's a let down to now have to take my services elsewhere.</Text>

Honestly what I appreciate most about living here is the people in the office. The staff is so kind and outgoing. I'll stop in with a question and the phones are non-stop ringing, but they still make you feel like a priority no matter what. There is also a new manager now and she is so nice and helpful. She is really good about communicating with you when you have any issues. I also appreciate the massive amount of parking here and honestly the location is perfect for my lifestyle. I have lived here for almost 4 years now, and I honestly couldn't imagine living anywhere else.< /text>

<Review>Absolutely love it here! My boyfriend and I moved into a 1 bedroom apartment with our Husky about 7 months ago. The unit is a perfect size and our bedroom is HUGE! All of my neighbors are extremely nice and welcoming. I love that this place is such an animal community! The location is prime. There are restaurants, Sierra Vista Mall, grocery stores etc within a 3 minute drive. There’s also a popular dog park 5 minutes down the road! I’ve met so many awesome people and their animals there. All of the amenities are squeaky clean and super nice! I use the tanning bed and gym pretty frequently. The staff is more than helpful with any of our concerns. The maintenance team is very prompt about fulfilling any maintenance requests. I’m actually very baffled to read negative reviews about Copper Beech and their staff... I couldn’t be more satisfied!</Review><Rating>5</Rating><user_id>113045728596341869213</user_id>< Pics>

my boyfriend live in this place for about 9 months. the majority of the time he was there he didn’t have any problems until he was being harassed by his roommate. he no longer felt safe being home and only had 3 months left in his lease. he reached out to the office and the lady he spoke to was super unprofessional and didn’t care about his problems at all. she said since nothing had physically happened yet there was nothing they could do and hung up on him. the apartments are very cheap and run down. maintenance doesn’t know why they are doing and hardly do their jobs right. DO NOT LIVE HERE! it will cause you more problems that it’s worth. please look elsewhere.</text>

Living at Copper Beech has been the best choice that I have made for myself. I absolutely love how big my room is and especially the convenience of the bathroom in my room. The kitchen is so spacious its large enough to fit myself and my 3 other roommates in their while cooking. The staff is super nice and the events that they throw on are super fun!<//Review>

<review>Excellent staff that works really hard to make living at Copper Beech one of the best experiences you can have. I have experienced a number of different student living complexes (Bulldog Village, University Village mostly), but Copper Beech truly offers the best amenities and works the hardest to provide a safe and amazing living environment. In my experience, the majority of young people who first move out expect way too much from their property managers to the point where it's infeasible and irrational. You can not expect a staff member to drop everything they are doing and wait on you hand and foot at a moment's notice when there are hundreds of other residents with potentially more pressing concerns. The staff at Copper Beech will do their best to meet your needs and provide wonderful customer service in the process.</review>< Pictures>

<review>This is a wonderful place for students!! The area is very safe. The complex has security fencing with coded entry. They also have security. The apartments are very roomy. My daughter rents a two bedroom apartment. The living areas are quite large. The bedrooms are upstairs and each one has its own private bathroom. There is a half-bath downstairs. The laundry room is also downstairs. There is a pantry in the kitchen as well as built-in appliances. There is a lot of storage space upstairs with extra cabinets. The apartments are clean and the complex is well maintained. Management is great and my daughter hasn’t had any issues. I do recommend paying for parking. Parking is limited and open spots are first come, first serve. Street parking isn’t recommended.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Maintenance is awful here at times. They are always inside our house at least twice a month doing God knows what. At least twice a year, they do "quarterly inspections" where they look throughout your entire home, take photos of your personal belongings, search through your cabinets and night stand drawers, touch your personal belongings searching for anything they can find, and removing bed sheets DURING COVID. I've never heard of an apartment complex taking photos of people's belongings.

The office staff are also not COVID cautious with multiple Tik Toks and instagram posts of the staff together with no masks. When I pass by the office and look inside the windows, I often see the staff with no masks. Melanie, the property manager, doesn't even pretend to wear a mask and walks around the office with residents present without a mask and up close. This makes me uncomfortable to even go inside the office since I am immune compromised and they have a lack of care about COVID precautions.< /text>

<Text>I took over a lease at Copper Beech and lived in the apartment for 2.5 months and paid a total of $1,500 in rent. During my time there, I was rarely in the apartment, never wore shoes inside, never had any guests, and kept things clean and tidy. Upon moving out, I spent about 5-6 hours cleaning and left the place in pristine condition. Copper Beech then charged me $264.66 for general cleaning, carpet cleaning, and painting! Do the math and $264.66 divided by $1,500 comes out to paying 17.6% more than I agreed to pay in rent.

When I tried to voice this concern in person, I was told that the property manager Melanie doesn't take appointments. I sent an email and got a response 14 days later (even though it said in writing that it would take no more than 3 days) saying these charges were just "part of the process [...] of getting the unit ready for the next resident".

Does this sound fair to you?

I have rented in four other places before this and never had any issues. Fresno is a large town and I recommend looking on craigslist or roomies.com for other options that are cheaper and have a sense of honesty. This is my first Google review because I get peeved when individuals are grotesquely unfair.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

I only lived in this complex for a very short time, long story short; my lease was going to be ending and my new lease didn’t start for 2 more months so I took over a lease at in a three bedroom (less than 3 month).

The condition of the apartment and room I moved into wasn’t anywhere near “good condition” but since I was only going to be there for a short amount of time I didn’t mind much as I wasn’t there a lot at all. Upon moving out my entire deposit was taken plus added fees on top for other things that were already damaged or run down from the previous tenants. The lease I took over only had 3 months remaining, so basically I was charged for all the damage and wear and tear that occurred in the last 9 months that was caused by someone else. They did an inspection before I moved in but the previous tenant was not charged for any of their damages, instead I guess I became responsible for them, even though the people in the office told me that I wouldn’t.

I reached out to management to get some understanding about these charges because I barely lived in this unit and my entire deposit was taken like I destroyed it. They aren’t willing to help out the tenants clearly because the excuse I got was that I “never turned in a “inventory and condition” form after I received my keys” which I 100% DID fill out this form and was so worried about being charged for things that I wasn’t responsible that I even called the office to make sure they got it and the lady on the phone assured me she received it and that she would add it to my file, but guess she never did (:

On top of that, they say it’s a “gated” community but the gate is left open pretty much all day, allowing random people to wander in and out of the complex, dumpsters and looking into cars all through the day, and when the gate IS closed, good luck getting it to actually work.

And we can’t forget about the roaches! I’ve never seen so many roaches in an apartment complex (not just in my unit or building, several of my friends also had this problem here) upon moving in the previous tenant warned me about the bug issue and had called for pest control. I had multiple letters from pest control on the counter when I moved in saying they came to spray but every time I was in the apartment I would see one or multiple.

I’ve lived in multiple different apartment complex and never had an issue with a deposit before, I’ve always gotten it back, I understand general cleaning fees but
the entire deposit? Guess it just hard for me to understand these charged because I was rarely at the apartment and the damages were there when I moved in, I even scrubbed the carpet in my room upon moving in because their were stains left by the previous tenant.

The rooms are big, but that’s about the only positive thing this place has got going for it. Furniture, carpet and everything else is dirty and cheap. I’ve heard awful things for years and I finally got to experience it myself.

Read the reviews on this page and take the advice for others with similar issues. You’ll have a much better living experience elsewhere.

EDIT: They reply to reviews on here and act like they want to help you but they aren’t helpful in person, email or over the phone when directly working with tenants to resolve any problems LMAO.
She literally replied to this review saying “as we discussed today” (never spoken to her today so that’s a straight up lie LMAO) and then she I’m being charged only for cleaning and paint but when I reached out about my deposit WEEKS AGO there’s was only one email interaction of her saying there’s nothing she can do for me or the charges against me since I never turned in my move in inspection form WHICH I DID. Sooo don’t be fooled by their fake sympathy replies it’s just for show ;)< /Review>< Pictures>

Good location for college students, it’s gated, staff is nice, and it’s a beautiful environment. I love the privacy you get by having your own bathroom, plus the rooms are spacious. The staff is also active in doing fun raffles, winning prizes, and accumulating points to win a gift card thru your phone.

I’ve had a good experience with maintenance helping out so far. When I call for a repair, they come within a few days. The only time theyd come late (rare) is because they’re busy doing other repairs in other units.

I’ve also seen bug infestation reviews going on here before, but I personally have never dealt with it. It could be if your roommate doesn’t take care of the apartment that leads to bugs. I’ve asked friends who are current/previous residents about bugs, but they never experienced it.

When there was in person classes, theyd have a shuttle that takes u to the school and back. Even the shuttle drivers are nice!

Overall, I do feel Copper Beech has been doing a good job. If u need help, they respond and help the best they can</review>< user_name>

We notify current residents by mass texts, emails, phone calls, and door knocks to ensure that we reach every current resident. We make every effort to offer our current residents the best rate possible to renew in their same bedroom. After looking through our system, it seems as though after contacting you about renewing, you had several questions regarding renewing but sending over a renewal was not requested by you at any point in time. I see that on 01/27 you were in contact with our staff asking if we are offering 6-month leases to which we responded in a timely manner. There is also an email from 02/18 from you asking questions regarding pricing. You emailed us again on 04/14 about the approval process, we responded. We had not received any contact from you until your most recent email from 05/06 at which most rooms in the 3x3 with garage had been filled including yours. We did offer you the option of transferring to another room or switching floor plans, which you declined. Our residents both current and new are important to us and we want everyone to have the best living experience possible.\n.Melanie Woods\nGeneral Manager'}< /Resp><user_id>116492230746300561165< /user_id>< rating>

I’ve lived here for 3 years & I tried renewing about 3x but never got a response back with my renewal contract via email! They tried saying I never emailed them and when I emailed back with the dates of my emails, they ignored it and just let me know that someone has already been placed in my room.. they prioritize new residents instead of working with current loyal residents. Make it make sense?! This is unfair. I even received the interactive email where we could choose if we wanted to renew or not with just 1 click and received nothing! Plus, I had been extremely ill and could not make my way to the office nor talk through the phone so I was depending on the emails to be responded to. Extemely upset! This needs to be seen by the manager.</Text>

I lived here through college for two years and upon moving out they tried to charge me over $800 in additional “cleaning” and move out expenses on top of our deposit! We were extremely clean and I’ve lived in a number of rentals so know exactly what to do upon move out. My father was also a landlord for 25 years and saw the apartment upon us moving out. Melissa was the property manager at the time and she was never helpful and super rude to us. They will try and get money out of you any way they can.</review>

The place is great, the cost is affordable, great for introverts who don't want to have to see their roommates all the time, and the staff is pretty chill. Just be careful with paying rent online because they will charge you around $70 even if you just made a typo on your routing number. I'd recommend just paying it in person if you can.</Text>

Overall this is a great community for any college student looking to meet new people. I have no complaints about the place.  Warning tho they will tow anyone’s car at your own expense, even if you are in your assigned spot. Your parking pass has to be visible at all times, so if you want to lend your spot to a friend make sure they have your permit in their car.< /review>

<text>This is a miserable place. I hate living here and dealing with the leasing office staff. The staff are unprofessional and do not care about their tenets.

I've only been living here for about a month and I have had no problems yet. The staff is great when I have any questions and I love the community. My townhouse was in great condition when I moved in, the neighbors are awesome, and I love how there is a shuttle that takes us to Fresno state as well as how there is just so much do around the complex such the pool or the basketball court.</review>

It is September & I moved out at the end of June. I have not received my security deposit yet, law says it should be returned after 30 days! They keep sugar coating saying they will send it by mail any day now! This happened to all 4 of my roommates! They also charged for paint cleaning which is illegal to do! When you're moving in they want everything paid and ready to go the day you move in but when you are ready to move out they take their sweet time on you.< /text>

This place is a joke. 10/10 recommend not living here. They are all for money and do nothing to help you. All they care about is getting a paycheck. Manager’s are rude, not willing to help and it’s embarrassing for this complex. They will tow your car with no authorization or reason to. Security doesn’t do their job and would recommend to stay far away from this place.</Review>

This place is so unprofessional. They say it's first come first serve for room availability. But that was not the case for me. I was told to fill out the application to process that I did that. And never received a call from them so I called in and I spoke with a guy who told me he would call back and tell me if they had availablity. He never called back so I had to call back the day after and I spoke with a lady who told me that earlier that day someone had signed for the last room available. When I had already gone through the process I was just waiting on them. On top of that when I went on a tour the guy was all weird with us. And I legit felt like they prioritized people they knew and the overall experience with them was not pleasant. They didn't make me feel welcome and willing to work with me. I don't recommend this place at all, once again they were very unprofessional.< /text>

Absolute nightmare.  You've been warned.  Management is nasty, roaches everywhere, paper thin walls (very noisy and they dont care), ugly furniture, horrible cardboard feeling mattress (the couch is better to sleep on).  Ruby is the new manager and she doesn't care to help fix anything.  They will treat you like a child here, random inspections to check for "cleanliness".  What is this the military barracks.  These are not dorms!!!  There are families and working adults here.  They look decent on the outside but trust me, nothing fancy inside at all.</text>

The reviews on this site are negative, but let me give you some other perspective on what they wrote.  The apartment that was open for tours was mine.  The management paid us to show our apartment on the condition that we kept it clean.  I ended up in the hospital, and we had a difficult time on a couple of occasions.  The management would always announce coming tours.  They never showed up unannounced (even if we were not home). Management does not show random apartments.

As for the roaches, I admit that there were roaches in the garage, but they were always dead. I mostly see them by the garbage, but I haven't seen any since seeing a new exterminator.

My family moved into Copper Beech last August of 2012 and we couldn't be happier. We love the spaciousness of the townhome and with 3 boys and a family of 5 we feel like we have plenty of space. Anytime we have had a concern or maintenance issue it has been addressed quickly and efficiently. The staff treats us with respect and is extremely professional. We enjoy all of the special events and contests they hold here. There are always opportunities to receive special perks and prizes. They go out of there way to show there appreciation for their tenants. Even though our lease isn't up until August we had NO hesitation in deciding to stay another year. We are looking forward to the pool opening soon which was ALWAYS clean and inviting. Our decision to move here has made all 5 of us happy and we feel like we have a wonderful "home" not just an apartment to live in.</Review>

The management here is a big mess. I have endless stories about how it sucks living here. One of the biggest things I hate about them is that they will turn off the water and let you know an hour before they do so. They say it'll only be off for an hr but 100% of the time this is a lie. It either takes the whole day or more than one day. And if you try to call them to see if they're going to do anything about they just say you have to figure it out. This is when I got mad and I told them they had to figure it out if not I'll be calling back and I won't be as nice on the phone and an hour later they bought everyone waters. But they only bought us water that one time.<//text>

<Review>One of the best place to live in Clovis Ca, and not a bad drive to fresno state make sure you take barstow shaw is too busy. There is a great way to socialize with a community friendly atmosphere and an awesome feel when you relax on your own patio. I would recommend this location to anyone.<//Review>< resp>

I bought the kid Goat cubes yesterday for the fourth time from this shop and excellent quality of meat. I cooked Bhuna Gosht using it today and it came out awesome. The meat was falling off from the bone when it was done which us a sign that the mutton is of great quality.

Hopefully, this shop will maintain the quality and will be consistent.</text>

Great clean and small shop.
Found out this place only last week and since then didn't buy meat from anywhere else. Everything is so clean and fresh. Importantly the customer service is awesome as well... Renjith took care of my requests and was super helpful and friendly...< /Text>

The butcher doesn't know how to cut any meat properly. It appeared like the pieces were cut in a hurry to the extent that chicken drums were also cut into 4 pieces.
The katla fish was cut in weird shapes and the skin wasn't removed.

Worst meat shop that I've got any meat from in my 4 years of stay in the U.S.<//text>

Loved the quality of meat. Long lines on Sunday though and with just one cashier who also does most of the cutting and packing. Can definitely optimize<//review>

Me and my friends ordered for a whole goat and distributed the meat among ourselves. The hope you have when you buy a whole goat is that at least you get meat from the same goat , I was really disappointed to see that the meat was kinda mixed , some tender some good some really tough. This place used to be good before, the quality has deteriorated over time.<//text>

<review>Traditionally, at New Year's we make Mutton Curry as a tradition in our family back home. This year, COVID and all, we were so homesick, we went to the the Meat Corner get our fresh cut goat meat (mutton) for making it during this Christmas weekend itself. And we will try making Lucknowi Dum Biryani as well (courtesy chef Ranveer Brar and his show on Amazon Prime Video )

We ordered online and went for pickup after 2 hours. While the cleanliness and hygiene may be a tad deficient as the the shop reeked, the meat was cut in front of us and looked fresh.

And they were practicing safety measures in all ways : masks. Gloves and social distancing are being followed inside the store.<//review>< Rate>

The store was clean and hygenic in the beginning. Looks like it is not maintained that way.
None of the employees wear masks, they do, but it is always on their chins. 2 employees laughed and smirked on being asked to wear it properly.
Sad to see one of the good places to buy meat in Sunnyvale turning into a smelly and unhygienic place.<//text>

It’s small and doesn’t have produce and all the other non-meat items other halal markets have, but that may not be a bad thing because it was so clean and well maintained. I haven’t seen any other halal markets in the area with this level of cleanliness. (There’s also a Cash’n’Carry right next door for those other things you might need.) The service was great and so were the prices. We’ll be back!< /Review>< UserId.>

<Text>I am a new FOREVER client!! Thank you Cecy for cutting my hair. This place is amazing and I'm just so sorry for not coming sooner. I couldn't be happier with the outcome. Customer service and the staff were excellent. My hair was done well beyond my expectations. Thank you Cecy for taking your time on my hair which need much help. Amazing results!< /Text>< pics>

This is my favorite veterinarian. they've helped me with so many of my dogs and cats.   The staff is so professional and friendly. And the doctors are very good at explaining what they feel is necessary.  Their costs are reasonable.< /review>

Love this place. Staff & Veterinarians are absolutely amazing.  Our 3.5 year old golden retriever loves going there. Which is a testament to how they treat all their animal patients. Recommended it to several people & they love it also.<//Text>

The Vet and Assistant were great very friendly and helpful.  Really listening to my concerns.
The front staff was not very helpful brought my two dogs in for their first visit.  I struggled to fill out papers while holding them.  Then trying to get them on the scale was difficult finally one of the other girls did help but I thought they could have helped sooner.<//Text>

< review>
Our dog suffered a major head injury and we arrived at Companion Pet Hospital without calling ahead after being turned away at another pet hospital.  As soon as we arrived Drs. Felton & Rodda evaluated him and within a minute or two the staff took over and gave our dog the attention he needed.  They treated and observed him for the rest of the day and sent us home at the end of the day with detailed instructions and medications.  We received follow-up phone calls after each visit and a week later he is recovering quickly with only minor issues because of the quick response and professional attention he received.
We are so thankful to have found Companion Pet Hospital in a crisis situation and can't express how impressed we were with the rapid response and professional care our dog received.  We also very much appreciate the compassion and support that the entire staff showed us during this difficult time!  They have been truly amazing and because of them we can't imagine going anywhere else for veterinary care.< /review>

<text>Excellent care during unusual times. A vet tech comes to your car to have you fill out paperwork, then the Dr. comes out to talk about what's happening with your pet. He/she will take your pet inside for examination and then will come back out to talk to you again. I can't speak highly enough about Dr. Machado and his kindness, patience and professionalism.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>Our 5 year old cat has been dealing with a nail bed infection for over three weeks now. We took him to another vet where a clip and clean, round of antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicine, and 3 hour stay at the hospital totaled over $500.00. Despite following instructions, our cat's infection was not improving.

We made an appointment with Belmont Pet Hospital and was able to be seen within days.

Dr. Ackerman was refreshingly kind and professional - she took her time with our kitty and also took into consideration our financial restraints. I felt no focus on monetary advancement, but true care for our cat and us as owners.

We made care plan A and plan B, ensuring we felt comfortable with each step and answered all questions thoroughly. And, she even offered to assist us via email (without having to pay for an additional visit).

Needless to say, we highly recommend using Belmont Pet Hospital for your animal care.<//Text><Rate>5< /Rate>< Response>

I drive farther to go to Belmont then my local vet because they have someone who specializes in smaller pets there every day (as opposed to some places which only have dog and cat people most days.)
The whole staff is great - from the receptionists to the vets.
Highly recommended.<//review>

I've been going there for 20 years. Dr Akerman is WONDERFUL and most compassionate vet I'veever had. The whole staff is great. But Deb is my favorite person. She greets u with a smile even though she has phones ringing off the hook and people lined up in the waiting room. She's just the best!!<//review>

<text>I highly recommend Belmont Pet Hospital. We left San Carlos Pet Hospital because I felt they did unnecessary testing on our dog for a common diagnosis, and I have never been happier with the choice to go to Belmont. Every vet we have seen has been professional, can explain things to me in terms I can understand, they are reasonable with their fees, and are very trustworthy. We have two medium size dogs that we bring here. 10 stars!!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1473171544272, 'text': "Christy, thank you very much for your kind review!

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>After moving to the area I decided to pick this place as my new vet based on the positive reviews but will not be returning after my negative experience. I needed to bring my dog in to get his glands expressed (I usually do every 6 months) and they had a vet tech express them who said they were very full.

About every day for the next week I noticed he was still scooting. I called them and they recommended I schedule an appointment with the vet to get the glands checked. The vet I met with asked me maybe one question and just took his heart rate and said "He probably has worms, I'm going to take him back and treat him." I was surprised he didn't even check the glands himself and assumed he had worms. There was also no discussion of costs or else had I known how pricey it was I would've just said no and purchased a $10 deworming kit at the store. When the vet tech brought my dog back, she said she did another expression and one of the sacs was very full. Nearly $200 later I paid for unnecessary deworming treatment and testing when it sounds like they didn't completely remove the fluid a week prior to that. When I received a call a few days later of the negative test result for worms, I expressed my concern for the unnecessary treatment and there was a total lack of empathy. No follow up calls or anything. I understand they run a business but when $$ is obviously more important than what makes sense for my dog I will absolutely not be returning to get taken advantage of like that again.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< name>

Was a quick visit since my groomer (petco ) injures by baby & he started limping, I was worried so got him to emergency to get his leg check. Turned out nothing serious but will be under observation for 5 days.The experience was ok I guess nothing bad or special, hope my boy gets better soon!</text>

<review>"DMV" Claxton apparently has no idea to check for basic things like ear infections, apparently his time goes towards clothes rather than fulfilling the promise of their outrageously priced services.
Be prepared to give up your rent if you want a healthy pet while using this place. Check that, a pet can't be healthy when being checked by a place that treats nonexistent issues while trying to guilt trip you into overpriced products that don't even work.< /review>< UserId.>

<Text>The Vets are fantastic and caring and the location is very convenient.  My cats have seen Drs. Burns and Ackerman and I've felt like they were getting excellent care.  However, Belmont Pet Hospital is easily one of the most expensive pet hospitals around and they don't offer or accept any pet care plans.  I thought maybe the prices just seemed high, but I pulled up records from my previous vet in the Marina district in SF and confirmed that Belmont Pet Hospital prices were up to 50% higher.  I was quoted $1000 for dental cleaning and hundreds of dollars more if tooth extractions are needed.  In SF, it cost $829 for a cleaning and X-ray and an extraction.

If you're in a position where money is no object when it comes to your pet, this is the place for you and I mean that sincerely.  It's a good pet hospital.  However, I've realized that the prices have resulted in my being afraid to seek care unless absolutely needed.  I need a quality, caring vet where I can put my pets' health back as the #1 concern, where it should be.  Unfortunately, I may need to look elsewhere to find that.< /Text>< GmapID>

Dental cleaning that required an extraction with blood work cost $2,930.
We compared with last years bill for the same exact check up with 4 extractions and it was then billed at $1,400. That was also under COVID conditions.

There is no rationale, the bill is full of meaningless items. Very unlikely to go back. We had a wonderful experience with the Veterinarian who used to run the place - no longer, unfortunately.

At these prices many pet owners will end up neglecting the health of their pets. We are looking at alternate clinics.</Review>

Unfortunately this spot is not close to the beach so we passed by on our way going back home. I arrived there maybe 2pm and they didn't have the special Instagram ice cream pics we see all the time so maybe better to call before you go and the one we try is good luke an any other place nothing special.  A lot of parking, there is not a problem.  Hopefully I will go back and try what I want.</review>

I will definitely be taking my kids back there again.  For the gelato of course, but more importantly the excellent service and great attitude!! Well done the moo!!</Review>< Pictures>

Wasn't expecting much when I saw all the unicorn stuff, but the gelato here is pretty good. I had the watermelon sorbet...really good flavor and texture.< /Review>

< review>
Very disappointed with our recent visit.  Selection was minimal (they say made daily, they open at 12 and we were here in afternoon so there should have been more). The product was somewhere between so so & meh.  Prices were too high for very small portions.
We will not be returning.
Would not recommend.< /review>

Please honor your published rewards programs! It is horrible for business if you publish any discount on any platform and not honor it when a new customer takes the time to travel to your establishment on their birthday only to get denied of the birthday reward... Of one tiny little scoop for that matter.  If you cancel your service with FiveStars, make sure they don't send notifications that I still have a rewards that expires in 2 days even after I got denied 4 days ago. You, the Moo, are responsible for honoring your published rewards and making sure the channel that you publish them on is updated. If not, honor the rewards until you correct the error!... Especially when I can show it to you live in person.  Was the scoop you had to throw away worth getting a negative review on Yelp and Google?

Just FYI, Duck Donuts honored my reward even though it did not show up in their system...kudos to them. Since then, they got a 5 Star review on Yelp and Google... And my daughters and their friends are planning to try their donuts because of the great customer service they provided.  I might even treat them because I want to go back....</text>

<Name>Lynda Nguyen<//Name><review>Drove out here because of my daughter's unicorn & mermaid obsession. The staff and owner went above and beyond this visit answering all our questions and accommodating a unique request.

I was looking for a unicorn horn & a mermaid tail to decorate my daughter's birthday cake. Sure enough; I got exactly what I was looking for!

Cupcakes were cute, moist and not too sweet. The unicorn cupcake was definitely pricey at $5 a pop but it didn't bother me because I was on a mission to find exactly what my daughter wished for! Strawberry flavored cake topped with creamy white frosting & hint of unicorn color; garnished with confetti sprinkles, a hand molded golden unicorn horn & a pair of white ears both made of white chocolate.

I was able to purchase 2 sides of mermaid tails for 99¢ each. It's hand molded out of white chocolate crafted in 3 different color combos.

Nice decor and welcoming atmosphere to hang out with perfect controlled air conditioning. I love that I have the choice of outdoor seatings for those perfect hot summer days. Large shopping center with easy parking.

I will definitely be back to try all of the Gelato flavors that they offer here.< /review>< UserId.>

One of the worst ice cream spot ever. Got Cookie monster ... ( got to say After Ice Cream is way better) Almond Pistachio ... They used way too much almond extract... Way overpowering and too much almond flavor - making it too sweet. Sadly, I got like only one or two pieces of nuts... Strawberry Cheesecake... Wow... This is the worst... Taste nothing like what it should be. It is just too sour!!! Got one piece of cheesecake... more like cream cheese... but wow...too sour...they should call it lemonade... Three scoops of ice cream plus one of those puffy... $16 buck... Not worth it... You all are better off going elsewhere... After, Cold Stone, Bruster, Rite Aid, Costco, anywhere but here... Honestly... The flavor here are off... Not the best but one of the worst ice cream... Service was horrible... They had two worker...but only one was working the other in the back... Took forever to get the puffy... Would not recommend it... Unless you want terrible ice cream and slow service...< /Review>

Ice cream was really good, the waffle cone on the other hand was not. it was not fluffy, more flat and could really taste the egg, undercooked.<//Review>

<Text>HORRIBLE SERVICE!  The gelato and the s'mores cookie are delicious, but the service is atrocious.
The last TWO times we have gone in we have had a family with children cut right in front of us, as if we weren't even there, and the server ignored us, helping the family first.
Ridiculous!
Whoever is the owner/manager of the Huntington Beach Moo at Edinger and Golden West should have a serious talk with the young people serving at that location.
We are locals and will never go back.
We walked out without ordering anything and called and left our number for the owner/manager to call us back, who I doubt we will hear from.
VERY disappointing.
If you want to sample The Moo I urge you to go to a DIFFERENT location!!!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

$23 for 24oz durian gelato delicious if you like durian and they have eliminated the smell if that's what you are afraid of. Otherwise would have paid for a smaller size even as a durian lover that just too much gelato to consume for 1 person.<//review>

I gave it one star because the ice cream is good or the gelato I should say but it is way overpriced for what they serve you've ever been to Italy you would now it doesn't cost that much so I should say  The gelato is close but definitely not the price< /text>

Best gelato in HB!! 🍦🍨 Small place with a fun atmosphere. Their waffle cones are fresh made and a must. Their flavor variety is on par with most ice cream places, but with fun twist. All their flavors are fresh made.< /Text>

Recently opened gelato spot that serves two hip dessert trends.

1. Unicorn Sunday
2. Egg waffle cone

I tried the egg waffle cone with my caramel popcorn gelato and it was good. The wait was longer than I wanted to have to endure but not horrible.

Great decor and plenty of parking make this a great spot to stop in for dessert.<//Text>

<text>The gelato was alright. I've had better. We got here at 9:30 and they said they wouldn't make the waffle cones or do the shakes. They had put everything away 30 mins early, and were annoyed that we came in. They also had some innappropiate music playing.<//text></record>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>I would describe myself as a fiend for sweets, so I was excited to learn about this new spot. When we went to order, I ordered the unicorn gelato in the jar, and my boyfriend ordered the gelato in the waffle cone. By far, the waffle cone is my favorite new trend for desserts. It’s sweet, but the flavor is neutral enough to where you are not overwhelmed by the sweetness of the gelato itself. As for the unicorn marshmallow toppings, it’s more for the IG picture rather than the flavor. I did enjoy the vibes here and definitely recommend trying this spot, even if it’s for the foodie pic.< /Review>< pics>

I met my friend here for lunch, since we both work in the area. We had two individual  combos, 1 order of Bone in, and another boneless. Cashier was very friendly and helpful, plus service was fast. We only had 30min for lunch not only was the food good, but they made it fast. I was able to return back to work in a timely matter, which I appreciate!<//Text>

<Review>Terrible customer service. They kept getting my order wrong after being repeated to them many times and kept me waiting for almost 30 minutes for nothing. They said they would fix the order but then proceeded to forget about me waiting altogether. They just looked like they did not care. Their overpriced junk food is not worth this kind of frustration. I will never buy from Wingstop ever again.<//Review></record>

Came into town tired and hungry.. We were told it would take 20 minutes for the order.. Waited the 20 minutes then they told me the order was lost and to wait another 20 minutes.. I got my money back and went to Mcdonalds where the order was correct and the food was ready in minutes<//Review>

<review>I don't like that Wing House. I had to have them replace my wings with other wings and they were too hot. I will never go to that place again besides they have the wrong color on the outside of the building, green. It should be orange to represent the orange sauce on the chicken. The chickens were little dried-up they were not moist. I don't know how they lasted this long. And you don't get napkins you have to share napkins coming off a roll that everyone else has touched. This disgusting. The people are nice but the chicken was not moist.</review><Name>Bobby Robby<//Name>< Response>

<rating>2<//rating><review>This was a family weekend for my Son's birthday.  We had loads of fun at Knotts Berry farm. Afterwards we came to Wing stop. It was a clean environment.  The service could of been better. The cashiers were all together in the front laughing and talking. Like 4 people all together for no reason. If they would concentrate on the customers and not having their on  conversation, then it would of been a 4. Customer Service is very important!!. If they would mix it up and have about 2 males working there, instead of chatty girls only, then maybe that would make an improvement.  Please change it up!!!!.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Hands down my favorite wings. Have all the usual flavors and levels of heat.  I Like the garlic parmesan and the mild sauce it's just snappy enough to let you know. Orders almost always take 18 minutes so they have their timing down to a science.<//review>

<Review>I am a wingstop lover because my kids got me into it and we have a habit of going to wingstop
every sunday night after church,  today I stopped at this location and the person who attended us was rude at taking th order , the worse thi g was when my daughter went to ask for some veggies as she got spiced up with the hot wings and she hot denied the veggies,  the rude lady said to my daughter she needed to buy another order of wings to vet more veggies,  this was not cool and I would never stop at this place again and never recommend to a friend .<//Review>< Pictures>

I hate that every time I order 10 wings they never give me my ranch ! Idc if they have to charge me for that one ranch but it’s just sad how they don’t offer it.  It’s the 3rd time this happens to me and the guy in the afternoon is so rude!</Text>

DO NOT ORDER extra seasoning or extra anything.  Been to this place 3 times ordering extra seasoning on wings and fries and this time, it comes out with barely any seasoning at all.  Wings are plain as well as the fries, they just do 1 or two shakes, 1 flip and then serve.  Tired of getting plain wings.  I'll drive the extra 10 miles to the other Wingstop.</review>

<Text>Its not as good or busy as the one by my work. I have been here several times and just dont go thete any more. One time the wings were only fried on one side, it was gross and another time they didnt put the lemon pepper on. There is no excuse for that so i just go the the place by my work which is great. Look at your food before you leave if picking up to go.</Text>< pictures>

Also great Mexican pottery along with fountains and other garden treasures. Inventory changes,  so if you see it & want it, you probably should buy it.  Then again, worth return visits to discover something new.< /text>< pics>

Awesome place. Everyone is so helpful. EXCELLENT PRICES! The inventory is amazing! We purchased a fountain, six tall pots and another large pot we are converting into a fire pit. This  is a great find that my friends told me about. I will be back again and again.</Text>

Definitely deserves a 5 star, but couldn't find certain products. But that's not their fault, it could be the import/export situation with the whole pandamic going on.< /Text>

Amazing choices of pottery; all sizes, glazes and shapes. Them there are succulents and also statuary.  What a gem of a place!  I bought several planters & pots and had full service assistance prepping the pots so they would survive the drive home. They loaded everything in my vehicle, too.  I will be back and will be sure to check out the place that sells palms next door.< /review>

If you are looking for landscape pots, this is the place to go for selection and great prices. Small, colorful pots to large clay or natural colors, they have it all. Prices are 50% less than everywhere else, sale prices even lower.<//text>

Amazing prices, selection and service. I honestly don't know why anyone would shop anywhere else for planters. We have become regular visitors and always find new stuff, whisical yard goodies and more. Don't expect a glossy store front with carts, air conditioning and near rows of junk you don't need. This place is honest and we are big fans.< /Review>

This place is so amazing. The potty is so pretty and priced reasonably. The service is great! They put everything in your car. The colors styles and designs of the pots are amazing! So much to see it takes awhile. I really like this place. They have a few succulents and soil. I would go here to buy plants. This is a place to get pottery. So many beautiful colors!< /review>

If you are looking for pots at a reasonable price and want a huge selection of all sorts of colors and shapes and styles this is the place to go. They also have a lot of statues and bird baths and even some really creative Willow outdoor furniture. And a lot of things are on sale so you'll want to check back frequently. In the springtime they have more of a selection of succulents< /text>

This place is fantastic with wide variety of planters. Pricing is unbelievable and worth stopping by. Wife and I purchased several planters , a few years ago before moving to Arizona. We're back to California and drove down two hours just to pick out planters. Suggested this place to All our family members.<//text>

IT DOES NOT GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!!! You can easily pass this one driving by it because there's so much tall greenery, once inside you'll be amazed at the rows and rows of planters and garden pots. Terracotta, ceramic, concrete and fiberglass. There's also seating benches and birdbaths and chimineas and fountains and statues. And the prices are absolutely amazing!  I LOVE this place 💛< /Text>

Just found out this place closed down when I drove by today. I've been going there for 30 yrs! So sad, the food was amazing, the staff so friendly, and I'll miss the ambience and memories. I even checked to make sure they were open before stopping by and it said open! 🤔🥲😥</text>

Great experience for my first visit.   Flavorful and inexpensive Mexican lunch buffet.  It's even cheaper than El Torito.  The food quality is good and tasty.  Options are limited but enough for you to choose from, and it will fill you up.  I came for their weekday lunch buffet 11am-2pm for $11.99.  Drinks are not included on the price.  Buffet includes menudo, caldo de albondigas, chile rellenos, rolled taquitos, chicken fajita, enchiladas, rice and beans, chile verde con carne, pork carnitas, salsa, pico de gallo, and much more.  Service staff are very helpful and friendly.  Plenty of parking.  I will definitely come back again.<//text>

<text>I don’t know how this place has 4.5 stars. When I went during lunch hour (what should have been the busiest time) there was only two other people. I ate some of my sisters plate and I didn’t even make it home in time to throw up. Now I have to wash my car.</text><Rating>1</Rating>< user_name>

I have been going to this place as a kid in the early 90s and still to this day my favorite dish taste exactly the same. This is a good thing. I love their flavor. Fajitas are bomb. Chips and salsa bomb. Tacos bomb. Its all bomb. Very consistent in flavor :)<//text>

It was a nice buffet with a wide variety of Mexican food and deserts. We ordered Margaritas, Bea ordered hers on the rocks and mine was blended. Not a bad price considering you can have about everything on the menu.< /Text>

The service was quick and friendly. The burritos are huge. We each ordered one and we could have shared and still had leftovers. I ordered the pork burrito and they brought a chicken one, but were very apologetic and quick to replace it. I'll go back again!< /Review>

We've been coming to Casa Gamino for years and have always had a good experience. Food is always good, service is always satisfactory, and prices have always been fair. The portions are always more than I can eat so there's always food going home for the next day.<//review>

Casa Camino is a friendly restaurant with a big menu, happy hour from 2 till 6 pm. They serve big portions of tasty food. I enjoyed a burrito Colorado which was good. The happy hour Margarita's don't have very much tequila in them. We liked the regular one, were you could taste the alcohol. I advise to ask for more tequila in the Margarita's or you will end up, sipping on some sweet strawberry ice water.<//Review>

<Text>THIS PLACE IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!  If I could leave no stars, I would. There was a TOOTH PICK in my dads beans, a HAIR on my sisters fish and my “fajitas” were pure grease. All we wanted was to take the fish off the bill because we didn’t even touch it after seeing the hair but when they refused to give us a refund AFTER taking back the full untouched fish, we decided to also be petty and bring up the toothpick that stabbed my dad in the gums. The lady immediately LAUGHED when we told her and refused to give us any sort of refund. I will never return. Hear my plea  -  DO NOT COME HERE.</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
To the Flores couple and their friend that gave this business one star.... Google reviews isn't a forum for entitled adult children to have a tantrum because a table wasn't available to be saved for you. You were either late 10 minutes for your reservation or you called them and wanted a table giving them 10 minutes notice during one of their busiest times. In either case that's on you not them.
Have a great day.
Having that been said. The food is delicious!</Review>

<text>Where do I start this was my first time coming this afternoon once I was seated I was very hungry the girl who seated did not give me a name or offered me my drinks or tell me who will be my waiter so I drove all the way from Costa Mesa very ready to eat I saw it was a buffet I automatically went and got a plate and if it’s you’re first time here you should tell them right away because once I finally got my food from the buffet my waiter finally got to me and said how was I and yes still no drink I told him it was my first time and how dose this work and he told me well you already got the buffet so I already knew the type of service I was gonna get I don’t understand maybe because I look young but it don’t matter I still tiped the taco man 5 bucks even tho I know he didint want to stay cause he had to leave and also the waiter I wasint aware of the times or anything so I apologize if I made you’re job harder but I give this place a soild 1<//text>< UserId.>

LOVE This place!   One of the best authentic Mexican buffets I've ever had. Even better on the weekends when they have a Fresh Grill making omelettes , pancakes and tacos.  The enchiladas go fast!!  Even have fresh ceviche  (shrimp cocktail) in the buffet.
They're buffet hours are daily 11am-2pm<//text>

The only complaint was that it was so uncomfortably Hot! Seemed like there was no air conditioner working! Maybe they should install some ceilling fans.I think this would help! Otherwise Their Food Was Great!! I Will go ther again!!🍴☕🍜🍉🍳<//text>

<Text>Worst manager! Very unprofessional!! Got mad a me for bringing to his attention that we were charged too much!! He got mad at us for questioning the reciept! Will never go back! Please check your reciept!! Before you leave!! I feel sorry for the employees who have to work for this guy!! Food is fine and the services from waiters and waitress are exilent. Too bad we wont be back, especially since we were told not to come back!!<//Text></record>

Cute local place. Dated carpet just makes it cutely reminiscent of family/ grandma's style. Came for dinner. Food tastes fresh, made there. Great taste for the price, and quick service for a Sunday night. Done get the Chile relleno. Chips are good and really crispy and warm. Salsa was tasty and not toooo hot.<//Review>

<UserId.>110279791803396979957</UserId.><rate>1</rate><text>We came here for my dads birthday. It was about 20 of us, they were good at accommodating us. The food was horrible though, we ordered the parrillada marisco and the chef, it was dry, overcooked, chewy and COLD. We though it was just us seeing as there were 20 of us, figured someone's food would be good. Out of morcajete, enchiladas, mojara, chicken nuggets and a few more items i think only the French fries on the chicken nugget order were OK. They don't seem to be trained to cook for a lot of people and its not like the restaurant was full, it was us and maybe 4 more people in the restaurant until the end when a few more showed up. The waiters did not come check to see if we needed refills or much of anything, we had to wave them down.  Restroom are right next to the kitchen which is to me not very sanitary and the restrooms smell like mold, i mean horrible. You really think twice if you really need to go because the smell is sooo bad. I have been to different Mexican restaurants and ordered parrilladas and this is by far the WORST place to eat mexican food. Will not be coming back, do not waste your time and money.</text>< time>

It was extremely busy...They don't put bleu cheese dressing in their salad bar so if you want some you have to pay an additional charge of $1.50 Every salad bar I have ever gone to has bleu cheese dressing as a choice so I think this is absolutely crazy to be charged for it!!!< /Text>

Authentic Mexican food at a great price. Casa Gamino has been around for decades and we will always continue going there. Great for a family birthday party or a breakfast get together with family. It also has a cozy little bar for those interested.<//Review>

Don’t recommend this place. As soon as you walk in you can smell the old rusty place, creepy looking. Food was nasty and very pricy! Ew ew ew! My kids and I  Didn’t even finish our food wanted to walk out asap.< /Review>

I visited this hometown Mexican restaurant on a visit back to Anaheim and it’s not the same as I remembered. The Chimichanga was fantastic however the spicy carrots and jalapeños tasted overtly like vinegar and looked  gelatinous. Not fresh at all! I am disappointed and most likely will not return.<//review>

Crunchy tacos, enchiladas, and flautas too. Chille rellenos and fresh ceviche. Wow and other yummy dishes. We went for the Sunday buffet or you can sit in the bar and order from the menu. Great service too. We will be repeat customers many times!!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

The chili Colorado was not like any other that I've ever had. It was not a spicy red sauce but rather a bland creamer sauce. We won't be back. Service was okay, but we were about the only diners.<//Text>

We came for the lunch buffet (10-2) and thoroughly enjoyed it. The line for the breakfast food (omelets, pancakes, asada etc) was pretty long). There were flautas, tacos, enchiladas, chili rellenos, carnitas, chicken fajitas several soups (our favorite was the seafood soup). The service was friendly.< /Review>

I finally had their breakfast and went with the breakfast quesadilla. It was better than I thought it would be, but it wasnt the best breakfast I've had. My wife had the French toast and that was also very good. Their bread was thick like Texas toast and personally I love that! Overall it was a good spot to have b-fast.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Their food tastes as if they got a kitchen full of Abuelitas, along w/Mario throwing down on the grill, you can not go wrong! Keep in mind,  this is a budget-friendly restaurant and you are going for food not welcoming servers.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>Great place to eat with more than one location.  Not generic food.  Great food that's a cross between Mexican and Cuban. Large portions at very reasonable prices--  actually lower than expected.  Excellent staff.  They will even make things that aren't on the menu, so don't be afraid to ask.  I always get the Carne Asada plate with an order of fried platanos ( bananas).  They'll fry them plain, or add cinnamon and sugar.  They are wonderful either way and its always enough that I can take home leftovers for a complete meal the next day!!   They have a special lunch menu and a lunch Buffett. So far haven't come across anything that I wouldn't order or recommend.  Best Mexican restraunt in southern California, in my opinion.< /text>< Rating>

<rate>4< /rate><Review>Today, I went to one of my favorite haunt's when I was passing thru Anaheim. I frequently revisit a restaurant/Deli that I enjoyed previously.
Today, my mood led me toward Margaritaville (maybe hearing it on the radio
had something to do with it...do you think?)

Damn subliminal messaging worked again!
Anyways, I sat at the bar and said to the bartender "I need a damn good tasting Margarita like I'm use to...he smiled and said that he can make it happen.

He brought me my Margarita and said to taste it because I came in at a good time.
After sipping it twice (I wanted to make sure before I spoke.)
I told him that it was a damn good tasting Margarita and will enjoy the rest once I decide on what to eat.

It was at this time, that he handed me a small bar menu which had several different "Happy Hour" food selections that all looked delicious.

After deciding on the Burrito with the chunks of pork which was marinated with a green sauce inside. I asked if it we're possible to make it "Wet with the red enchilada sauce"
He said no problem because it automatically is served that way.

Circling back to when he mentioned about coming in at a good time, he told me the wet burrito was $7.00 and the Margarita is only $4.00..such a deal.

I responded with a smile and said "that is incredible and let's get this show on the road.
It was about 10 min.that passed and he was already bringing out this large wet size burrito (with ez on the melting cheese.)

Let me tell you, that I enjoyed every last bite as I slathered some sour cream on top. I took a breather for about 5 min. and then finished off the second half with equal enjoyment.
I want to thank the bartender who worked the early afternoon shift for making my visit an enjoyable one. As usual, I'll be back.
Thank you!</Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I have been there several times. My husband and I love the  chile verde that they have everyday for buffet.  But every time we have gone  we get really bad customer service . The waitress and a waiter have no good customer service. This last time I went I was having menudo So the waiter saw me looking at it and he asked me if everything was ok ? I said there are 2 small hairs in my menudo. He said well it's a buffet what do you expect !? I didn't say anything so he said give me the plate because my sure your not going to eat it anymore!. My husband and I just looked at each other and dicited not to go there any more.< /review>

<Review>WORST COSTUMER SERVICE EVER! THE MANAGER THERE NEEDS TO TAKE SOME COSTUMER SERVICE CLASSES BECAUSE HE CLEARLY NEEDS THEM. WE ASKED FOR A TABLE IN ADVANCE AND THEY DIDNT WANT TO GIVE IT TO US. ONCE WE ARRIVED, THEY KEPT GIVING TABLES TO OTHER FAMILIES. TOTALLY IGNORED US. THE MANAGER BASCIALLY SAID HE DIDNT HAVE TIME FOR US AND HE DIDNT CARE WHAT WE NEEDED. WON'T BE COMING BACK HERE ANYMORE. USED TO BE OUR FAVORITE PLACE TO COME AND EAT AS A FAMILY, BUT NOT ANYMORE.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I liked this place because of its all you can eat breakfast buffet. Only a 4 star though due to the fact that it does seem a bit dirty< /Text>

New cook, disgusting food, I had a rotten chile, over cooked steak (and I paid for Ranchera and it wasn't), disgusting guacamole, and the pico de gallo tasted bad, even the rice wasn't fully cooked. The person who contacted the owner told us that they were sorry  but the cook is new. I understand that ,,, but a cook new or experienced shouldn't serve rotten food and they gave me $15 gift certificate, we paid $45 for that disgusting food, and I would like you guys to check your "To Go" orders before you leave premises, don't get a bad surprise like I did<//Text>

Changed my rating from 2 to 4 stars.. We returned to Casa Gaming yesterday even though I had previously said I wasn't going to return.  This visit I gotta admit the food was very tasty. I ordered a soft Carnitas taco, enchilada on the dinner menu (there menu is extensive). My meal was very good. They serve chips before we ordered; the chips were thin, warm and the taste is excellent. The salsa is good; I add Pica de Gallo to add flavor to chips and my meal.

Before this recent visit I said:

The food was okay (about 3 stars). The interior is also 3 stars, exterior 2 stars.

Big problem with this restaurant (my visit) though, the margarita was terrible. Even worse than the terrible margarita was when I mentioned it to the manager he did nothing to make me a happy customer, not even offer to take it off my check. That reflects very poor management and showing me that he evidently doesn't care if I return. I had taken a small drink and asked the person I was with to taste it also. I asked him to look at the margarita, taste it, but he wouldn't do either. Both of us (his customers) agree it was very bad.

I was a bit persistent with the manager just how bad it was.."the worst margarita I have ever had", I told him. The waiter when asked about the drink told the manager with a shrug that it was a "Happy Hour" margarita...does that mean they serve bad margaritas during Happy Hour?

A side note on this is that one member of the family does like this restaurant and dines there fairly regularly; it reminds her of her family outings (but she drinks wine not the margaritas). She had warned me that the margaritas were bad.. I am sorry I didn't listen to her. I mean, how can you mess up a margarita? She said, "I love there food but I order a glass of wine, they can't ruin that).

In one other visit, I did like the Buffet.

I am not returning. Also, I can't recommend this restaurant with poor management because poor management is unacceptable.

< Review>
Yes. i am originally from texas. This place is very comparable to some of the best mexican restaurants in south texas. Very good food. Everything from the enchiladas, flautas, and caldo. Cheap and authentic. Can't beat that.</Review>
