We replaced 13 mailboxes in our community. Took like 6 calls and a personal appearance to get them to install the locks. Mail was supposed to held for 2 days. Ended up being a week. That was 4 months ago. They have still never came back to install the locks for the Small parcel boxes in each. First they said there were backed logged 2 months. Well it’s been 4, no follow up, no locks, no word. Absolutely horrible customer service.<//Review>

<text>This is a postal Annex, not a service office. They are responsible for sorting and delivering mail. That said, they do in fact offer a window in which one can pick up packages that could not be delivered or put in a no delivery request, or any of the other delivery specific requests one would need from the US Postal Service. My personal experiences with the staff have been courteous and fair.<//text>< Pics>

<text>By far the WORST distribution center I have ever had the misfortune of living in the delivery route of. This is the only location where I have had packages delivered to people who are Not me and signed by people who are Not me.

Tracking history shows that they're always lost at the point where the mail is out for delivery so it's absolutely this location that screws things up. If I can avoid having things sent to me through USPS I will just to avoid this distribution center.<//text>< name>

Horrible!  They do not answer the phone, just trying to call and get business hours because their website states they are open from 12:01am to 11:59 pm today and you know that's wrong. I've called 15 times and they don't pick up nor do they even have any kind of automated service that at least gives hours and address, etc. This is 100% consistent to the other reviews, what a waste of a post office service.<//Review>

< Review>
I would really like to know why we don’t have a real post office. For reasons only known to my postal carrier, my mail hasn’t been delivered in weeks because “my box is full.” Except it’s not full. There’s nothing in there. And I just called to straighten out the mystery of where my mail is now, and the woman who answered the phone kept screaming at me. I kept asking if she was on a cell phone and she just kept screaming. It made it very difficult to understand what she was trying to say. Long story short, sounds like they have just been chucking my mail in the trash. I don’t have it. It’s not in my mailbox. And screaming lady insists it’s not in her building. I’ve been calling for weeks and this has been the first time a human being has answered the phone. The whole thing feels like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch with Steve Martin and Gilda Radner. This is my third time trying to track down missing mail with these folks. Last time the postal carrier kept giving me notices to pick something up in Laguna Beach and it was never there. Aliso Viejo eventually returned it to the sender in the UK. I never knew it was at AV because all the slips said LB<//Review>

It’s been 7 days since the expected delivery date and I still haven’t gotten my package. First they were late from the expected delivery date, then they took it back since no one was home, then I scheduled a redelivery online and got a confirmation yet they still came on another day two days before the scheduled date and missed me again. I called many times couldn’t get a hold of anybody,  just today my scheduled redelivery date which I have gotten a confirmation email gaurentee it will be delivered today, I seriously stay put all day from 9 to 8pm wouldn’t even go to the mailbox in fear of missing them, no one showed up. Now I have no idea where my package is which contains very important documents including my graduation certificate and RN liscence, I have to take another day off work to go into their office to find out, wish me luck... I just hope they didn’t lose it or send it back to China...< /review>

AWFUL & RUDE!!!! This is the hub for mail delivery in Laguna Beach and we routinely do NOT get our mail delivered, our entire street gets skipped. Last weekend the driver marked a packaged delivered when in fact she did not deliver it and didn't feel like turning around to deliver it. In the mean time, we  went two days thinking the package was stolen because we went by USPS website tracking. Amazon refunded us. When I called USPS hub to ask what the hell was going on they said oh sorry she'll bring it today. This is extreme laziness. Who does this, government workers do. When you do call the hub plan on letting it ring about 30 times until the line disconnects, you'll then have to call back AGAIN, it's the ONLY way to get them to answer the phone. When they do answer they are so rude. Mail delivery needs to get privatized. I cannot believe my tax dollars used for these peoples salary!<//review>

This is a review for the delivery person from this USPS center (Aliso Viejo). I ordered a cell phone to be used out of the country. I had a trip coming up. On the first delivery, the package is said to be delivered, but we did not see it. We contacted BestBuy who then admitted that they didn't request a signature for the delivery, so they mailed out a second phone at no extra cost to me. I am now only a few days away from my trip. The second phone was expected to arrive on Wednesday, my wife stayed home all day to accept the delivery. It did not happen. We tracked it online, and its status changed to "Delivery attempt: action needed. Notice left (No authorized recipient available." That's odd, our bell didn't ring and there was no  knocks on the door. We checked our mail box and saw a paper notification saying we could either schedule a re-delivery, or come pick it up at the post office. Our trip is Thursday. Well played Mr. Mailman. Your saving of a few steps to our front door has caused us headaches, wasted time and money.<//review>

Carriers out of this faux post office constantly deliver my mail to the wrong address.  Nine eBay items have gone missing in the hands of these incompetent carriers who are given routes way too large to handle.  The back of this post office is as disorganized as a kindergarteners.  I've lodged many complaints up to the manager but still mail is marked "delivered at mailbox" yet I don't get it and my lazy neighbors never bring it to me either so it just goes in someone's trash.<//Review>

I dont know why I have to deal with the most unefficient services, I overpaid for the shipment to get the package on Tuesday, and the carrier decide to hold it at thier office instead of leaving it at my door or my mail box. How I am supposed to get it when they only open few hours a day, very uneffiecient hours,,and they dont even respond to the phone during their open hours, do I need to take a day off my work to get my package late from this office. I already missed the party because the carrier decide to hold it!<//Text>

<Text>awful customer service...finally answered then put me on hold for 5 minutes..then answered and said she doesn't have a computer to look at my tracking info...mind you this is with her having a snobby obnoxious attitude. She rudely collects my info insisting that I would receive a call back...Made no mention of the time frame to expect a call...then I never received a call. Several days later I am calling them, the phone has been ringing since before I started this message..Literally right now they just picked up!..Asked if I could hold again!! haha...He pretends as if he can't hear me when I say I can hold and hangs up...Now I have to call again..Terrible.

FRAUDULENT.

Registered certified mail addressed to me.
Postmarked 2/24/2015

1. I actually received FIRST notice 6/12/2015.  Is there a little DELAY here?  Like THREE AND A HALF MONTHS?!

2. In that first notice, only the first 4 characters and the last 4 characters of the tracking number were included.  There was a LINE DRAWN between the first 4 and last 4 characters.  Lacking that information which a human WAS TOO LAZY TO PROVIDE I had no idea who the sender was. The tracking number, IF IT WAS COMPLETELY PROVIDED OF COURSE, could be used to go on-line to see who the sender is.

3. The "sender" box was also mysteriously EMPTY.

Am I being chased down for some crime somewhere?  Maybe the sender doesn't want me to know who they are before I accept the delivery?

I put this first notice, unsigned by me, back in to the mailbox for the mail person to take BACK to the Aliso Viejo post office.  I indicated the LACK of information (the sender) and the information deliberately left incomplete (the tracking number)

4. Received the SECOND notice from the post office on 6/16/2015.  Amazingly, the tracking number is now completely filled out and the sender name is included.  However now I no longer have the option to accept the delivery by going on-line - I'll need to DRIVE TO THE POST OFFICE.

5. DRIVE to the Aliso Viejo post office (Remember, I am no longer allowed to sign for it online, for some unexplained reason).

6.  Pick up the mail which was sent to me THREE AND A HALF MONTHS AGO, notice on the front of the envelope "N/C 2-26-15".

How can anything get "lost" in the mail like this?  We know the Aliso Viejo post office had it since 2/26/2015.  Why are they hiding the tracking number and the sender name?</Review>

< Review>
Received a parcel, but the key to the locker that the parcel was kept in, did not work.  This happened last week for the first time, and I reported it to the office, and then waited to meet the mail person.  She had not been informed that the key did not work and had to use her master key to open it.  SHe told me that she wld advise the supervisor, as she was not the ususal mail person for this area.  Yesterday, the key was left in my box again, as I received a parcel, but AGAIN, the key did not open the locker.  We are senior citizens and we do receive our medication thru the mail.  This is very frustrating and cld pose a problem if we don' get out  medication in time.

It is sad that this Mail Station has had a one star rating for a long time now, but still does not do anything to improve.<//Review>

This EPIC FAIL is a perfect example of what is wrong with this organization.

For normal people in the 21st century who lookup the business hours online it says PICKUP ONLY M-F 10a-5pm.

But this place is stuck in 1927 because when you get there, the door is locked, and the sign says  10a-THREE PM.

And if you ring the bell or knock, nobody answers even thou you can hear the employees on the other side of the door because they are 3 feet away from you.  So you walk away feeling totally ignored by this incompetent operation.

My father and grandmother were both USPS employees for over 30yrs each in SoCal. Even after hearing all the BS that the USPS is involved with, this place took the term 'total waste of time' to an all new level.   Whoever runs this branch, section, division whatever should be FIRED.<//Text>

Walked in and rang the bell for assistance several times, heard the bell ringing, and heard people talking, but nobody came to the door. Knocked on the door and still no reply just heard people talking on the other side</Text>

I waited 20 minutes before anyone answered the bell or door - and then when he did, he was totally rude and didn't care one bit about his customers and the long line of waiting people - awful experience!</text>

This could cost you a lot of money as when you tell a shipper you didn't receive the package, they say "sorry". It shows delivered!

<Response>{'time': 1621028127037, 'text': 'William - we appreciate your consistent heating and air conditioning service. Thank you for taking the time to leave us a Google review! Stay comfortable & Aire Serv of the Gold Country be there next time you need us.'}< /Response><Name>William G</Name>< Review>
Very customer service oriented. We have used Aire Serv for our heating and a/c  for approximately 8 years. They do our summer and winter maintenance. They have repaired the heat system which had been setup for LP gas by the previous owner, but we have propane. They replaced ducts with metal under the house when rats chewed through the old plastic ones. Recently the a/c was blowing warm. You are right they fixed it. All the work they have done for us in record time with friendly, efficient and professional customer service. They are friendly and professional on the phone and in your home. We give them  10  and recommend them to everyone who needs help with a/c and heat!</Review>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>I received two quotes for a mini-split system in my detached office on my property just outside of Sutter Creek. Aire Serv provided a detailed quote with many guarantees.  I chose them because the price was similar to another quote from a vendor who was rude and arrogant -- coincidentally Aire Serv was about 10% less, but this was not the primary factor. They ended up installing the system 2 weeks earlier than they had estimated to my delight. Overall the installation appeared to be professional with one exception -- the tech who was the last to leave didn't come with a vacuum to clean up the mess left behind on my carpet.  Although he did offer to use my vacuum, I think that it's inappropriate to expect a customer to provide basic equipment.  My desk and furniture were also covered with a very light fine dust as they didn't cover anything.  I wasn't too bothered by that and vacuumed up the carpet mess (some drywall and dust) on the carpet.  The quality of the workmanship appeared to be high.  They were missing a part and left equipment and materials here promising to come back to finish the work -- but the unit was working and I was in a nice cool office. Great!

A week and a half went by and I didn't hear from anyone.  Their ladder and materials were still here and a conduit was exposed because of the missing part. I called to find out when I might see someone and a tech was out two days later to finish the install.  In the meantime, a leak had developed behind the unit (condensation) and the drain they installed did not angle downward into the dirt, so the water flowed back up the pipe due to surface tension and created a small river of water across the walkway instead of in the planter bed. No biggie -- they addressed all of these issues.

Unfortunately this fix was inadequate -- the unit still leaked behind the evaporator.  So I wrote my sales person, Brent Anderson, again on Tuesday.  It was my understanding someone would be out Friday -- nope. Sunday I wrote again to find out when someone would be out -- this time I sent pictures and video of the water streaming down my wall onto my carpet. I had to place a dog dish underneath the unit to catch the water.  Someone came out the next day (Monday) and attempted another repair.

Unfortunately the 2nd attempt was unsuccessful.  There appears to be literally no difference.  I took new video and pictures (attached here).  They were bidding on a whole house replacement for our 20 year old central 5 ton unit -- yeah no. I don't trust them and would never hire them again.  I will update this review after their THIRD attempt to repair this unit.

Things happen, sure. But how many times does one attempt the same repair before maybe thinking, "This isn't working, perhaps we need to try something different.".  Good intentions are meaningless when one spends over $6,000 on a mini split that drains water inside your carpeted  room?. One of two things are afoot here -- either this Mitsubishi unit or related parts are defective or the installer/tech is incompetent or some degree of both.  I honestly don't know which it is, but I'll have a pretty good idea if the third attempt is another failure.

Two stars for being professional, accessible (Brent) and timely (early install).  - 3 stars for 2 failed repair attempts and having to follow up to find out when the repair tech would be out.  Another star or more will come off if the third attempt is a failure.  Again, needless to say, I will not be using them for our central AC.

Be careful.

Update 8/31 - A tech came out Saturday 8/29 to look into the leak.  He explained to me that the reason the unit was leaking was due to the decision to couple the manufacturer's drain hose behind the wall rather than run it completely outside and into a PVC drain. I explained several times that I was fine with any modification that didn't make any new holes in the house.  Unfortunately, new holes were made where a new raceway was added.  All I wanted was the leak fixed, not a whole new ugly cover! Raceway removed, but holes remain (pic).<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhl-O1DE8n6pIUj-VjMXJju3-YuNotveK1KBhj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxzuao8TfNeoYYeBmO6YsM5379QmwEQqRPXeM5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1sTCY-hNprjT356E_MEJdJlLRk-6zNHZcrDmv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAdXvgbUpDst0vXPrEO-HEcYecKOFOvTLUnQZc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIyEtAsVMhotNRUv1-YRrUc0WoCCJRW8LKqnC0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><response>{'time': 1598889979797, 'text': 'Erik - we value our reputation in the area & strive to achieve customer satisfaction.

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>This business is altogether one of my favorites of all businesses in the area. They put into practice the logical practices of business from what sadly is now a bygone era - such as calling the customer back; showing up on time; excellent response time; excellent bids and overall kindness, care and concern regarding the service they're providing. We've been utilizing their services for many years now and in the last week, we unfortunately had a series of issues due to the age of our (2) A/C units and various representatives were here nearly immediately in order to address the issues and they all provided top notch service with educated answers and recommendations. They all basically worked around the clock and on the weekends in order to dial everything in and get us taken care of. Not only that, everyone that has come out over the years and even the receptionists who answer the phones and handle the scheduling/questions, are ALL top tier and extremely nice. We personally want to thank Joe, Brent, Travis, the three other techs that came today for install, the receptionists and all the way to the management and ownership who truly have a killer crew - working hard in extremely hot conditions - and yet always remain consistent - friendly and great. THANK YOU !! (They also made a special trip out in order to give us a powerful loaner A/C unit while we were waiting for the new system. Very cool.)</Review>< Pictures>

Our inspector, Walid Bawab was early and worked very hard all afternoon when discovering my new house had two systems. Gave great advice and educated us on the systems. The price was so reasonable. The company sent invoice and quotes to make the repairs needed. I Will’s use them for all the repairs and am going to use them yearly for maintenance. Truly outstanding experience.<//Text>

I was very impressed with the service tech that serviced my 4 HVAC systems.
He was very professional and very through. He found some technical issues missed by companies in the past He found 2 pre filters on my electronic air cleaners that were damaged by a previous company and just reinstalled.
He found one condenser that was overcharged too.

Will have them service my units in the fall.</Text>

After making contact, a date and time was given to us when a service representative would be at our home (which happened to be on a Sunday). Not only did the service representative, Joe Dinner, come at the scheduled time, he also called when he was on his way. He was friendly, courteous, knowledgeable, and even put on "house slippers" when entering our home to turn on the unit! He quickly assessed the unit, located the (two) problems, and replaced the items that were needed. He kept us informed throughout all steps, and had everything fixed in a timely manner. We were very impressed with Aire Serv of the Gold Country and Joe Dinner, and will use them again, if needed.</Review>< pics>

<GmapID>0x80907d65b177d24d:0xb226a778faa16005<//GmapID><rating>4<//rating><text>If it were possible, I'd have given 4.9 stars.  The combined heating/cooling unit in a commercial building I was in the process of selling, and was in the final stages of escrow, would not turn on in either mode.  I called Aire Serv first mainly because they had a branch near me.  The person who made the appointment was completely professional and courteous, and explained the estimating and billing protocol clearly.  The serviceman in training and his supervisor, who mostly stayed in the service truck,  arrived approximately 10 minutes late, but the serviceman promptly got to work with his diagnostic procedures.  After determining that the heat and AC would function if given the necessary input from the digital wall thermostat, he recommended replacing the t'stat, and gave me three model options.  Because I elected to have him do the installation, the $100 diagnostic fee was waived, as I had been told when making the appointment on the phone.  The new t'stat, which they had along with many other parts and supplies in the service truck, had the heat and AC functioning normally, and I was given a basic tutorial on programming.  The serviceman and supervisor were efficient, professional, friendly, and patient with me hovering around and asking questions.
The next day I scrolled around on Amazon and compared the prices of what I thought would be comparable thermostats - mostly in the $50 - to - $80 range with free shipping.  But I admit this comparison may not be valid; perhaps the brand Aire Serv recommended is one their experience indicates has a better history of performance and long-term reliability.  Of course they'd be well motivated not to install unreliable components that end up causing callbacks that affect their net profits.  My total charge for the service call, not broken down into parts and labor, was $344, which seems a little steep; however, I have to temper this initial reaction with the acknowledgement that Aire Serv provided a relatively prompt and valuable service, and resolved the problem at a time when I really  didn't want any delays in the escrow process.  I'd do business with them again in the future.</text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I called after 5 on a Saturday and got a tech out to look at the system that night. No additional emergency or after-hours charges. It turned into a big job. The techs did an excellent job communicating with us and showing us pictures of the problem areas. They were very respectful of the home & occupants. They were very thorough and wanted to get the job done right, despite all the challenges the system was giving them. It was clear that techs from other companies in the past tried and gave up. These guys though, finished what they started. They are very knowledgable and practical. I will highly recommend them to anyone who needs their services.< /review>

Aire Serv provided timely, thorough service when my A/C stopped working over the weekend. They had parts on-hand and ready to go! Prices were fair and up front and there was no additional charge for the weekend. My service professional, Glenton, was extremely knowledgeable, polite, and efficient. We ended up with a fairly big issue and our service tech ensured it was fixed prior to leaving, even on a Saturday evening. He definitely went the extra mile. I received A+ customer service.<//Text>

We needed emergency, weekend repair to our furnace. Made one phone call to their calling service and had a tech come out within 3 hours to diagnose and do the repair. They know their stuff!<//text>

I called close to 5 pm and was promised to get a call back as the company is a 24 hour service. It was a nice promise with no followup. The next day I called again at 2 PM this time they recognised me and put me on a 30 minute hold to see what they can do. with over 100 degrees hear i was expecting them to be swift in responding to a down air conditioning system but to my amazement they told me they can come a week from today. Needless to say this is the worst service call I got in my life. I hope I am the exception.</review>

I wish I could give them more stars!!!! I called them for a second opinion, which is no charge for a second opinion from them. (Awesome I know) our technician arrived on time! And he put booties over his shoes so nothing got tracked inside our home from outside. I thought that was so awesome because we have a young puppy. He troubleshooted the issue super fast and walked us threw all of our options. We have AC and thats all that we wanted!! I highly recommend this company!!!!!!! Their  Honest, Dependable, Trust worthy, reliable just an all around great company!! They truly care about helping their customers!!!!!</text>

Do not use this company!

No show no call no service?

Jan 30 2019,I made an repair appointment at 4:30 pm, and I called back at 4 4:30 5 pm to confirm someone is coming?

I was told by the service lady Heather,he is on the way?

Up to 8 pm, no one comes? No one called?

The service is not as what they told you on the phone!

They are not reliable at all!

Try others! You might pay for nothing.<//Review>

<text>Aire Serv in Valley Springs, CA, provided service within 24 hours of our phone call. Their technician was professional and highly-skilled. He diagnosed our furnace's problem, repaired it, and got it running great again. We were so thankful because the furnace had broken down in the middle of a freezing spell so we only had a fireplace for heat overnight. Their customer service rep was able to work the schedule for a technician to come out as soon as was possible. Both she and the technician were very communicative, very skilled and professional in all their work for us. We highly recommend Aire Serv for heater repairs.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

We highly recommend Aire Serv.  They responded to our failed HVAC immediately, even though we called after 5pm.  Joe was able to diagnose the problem right away (some corroded wires), and we had our HVAC back up and running that same evening, and for a reasonable price too!  Thank you Aire Serv!<//review>

Brent, Suk, and Danny did an excellent job on our dome house. It was a challenge for them and they did excellent work. Brent took our whole project and our budget into consideration and proposed a 3 phase solution. He checkid in with us several times to make sure we were happy & check on progress. Suk & Danny worked long hours in the heat & kept a positive attitude. They were patient, polite, & creatively solved all the install challanges our house presented. I really appreciate that they consulted us throughout the install to make sure we were happy with & understood unit & line placement. We had 3 units installed. They work excellently and reach all the difficult areas that we were concerned about. We could not be more happy to recommend Aireserve.< /text>

I'm sad to say that our experience with Aire Serv of the Gold Country here in Valley Springs was not only annoying, but also insulting! I much rather write a glowing report on a job well done, but when someone mistreats my elderly father it really gets under my skin! Dad lives in a small home on our farm and takes pride in still being able to arrange the care of things around the here if he cannot do them himself. We both also like to support our local businesses, so when he decided to call AireServ for some maintenance on his Heat/AC system I was happy to hear he called these guys. Their truck is parked down the road every night, so they're not just local, they're neighbors.

Well, the reason we're both unhappy with their service is that they failed to provide any. Dad called and made an appointment, but on the morning AireServ was supposed to arrive they called and to reschedule, This was fine since we didn't have an emergency and according to the Heather they had a trouble-call to attend to and promising to come the following week and with the heat we get here in the Summer it's completely understandable.

Then it happened again, waiting until the morning of our 2nd appointment to notify us they wouldn't make it, but promised they would make it if we rescheduled. Not very professional in my opinion, so I was growing annoyed, but Dad is more forgiving than I am, so we sat tight and waited for the 3rd appointment.

As I'm sure you've already guessed, they called again, but this time it was 2 days before that appt., and the owner called and simply cancelled on us! His excuse was that he is too busy to do the maintenance job he'd arranged to do, saying that he would only be available when/if the system quit working. What kind of business-person treats a prospective customer like that?

Not only did he give us the run-around and wasted our time, but he made my Dad feel like he wasn't worth his effort, and his decision to maintain his home was without merit...that's what really grinds my gears. Treat me however and I'll just dismiss it out of hand, mistreat my family and you've gone too far!

Please reconsider choosing Aire Serv, we haven't ever been mistreated and misled by another small business like this, their customer service is deplorable!<//Review>

< Review>
This is a way overdue review about Fairview Pet Hospital and his wonderful staff of people and the kindest man my husband and I ever met Dr Kang. We have all our cats in Dr Kang's care and we couldn't be happier on how he treat us and our furry babies. Dr Kang is very knowledgeable and always upfront with explaining treatments when necessary. He's heart is there for the well being of our beloved pets. We found also his prices to be very reasonable without trying to push medications or procedures if they are not necessary. Last year our senior cat Major Tom developed a lump which Dr Kang removed but it turned out to be a very insidious form of cancer, fibrosarcoma to be precised. Dr Kang worned us that these kind of cancers do usually come back and to keep an eye on it. So we did. Few months later the tumor was back but grew in such a way Dr Kang adviced us to go to an oncologist because at this point do to the nature of this particular tumor and the location in Tom's body, he felt  that a specialized oncologist would be more appropriate to take our case for a second opinion. At the oncologist visit we sadly learned that Tom's tumor was unoperable and that he probably had another 6 months more to live. We took him back to Dr Kang where he prescribed medication to allow Tom to live more comfortable for what ever time he had left on this earth. Recently Tom started to declined and visibly he was in a lot of pain. So my husband and I made the decision to let him go. We called Dr Kang for an in-home euthanasia. We felt our boy deserved to go in our home and in our arms. Dr Kang came on time at the set up appointment with his assitant Monica (God bless her!). The all experience was sad but beautiful. Dr Kang after assessing Tom's health, explained everything was going to happen first and he gave us time to make our final decision. So we signed and the process began. It was slow, humane and emotionally painful, but Dr Kang and Monica presence gave us strength in the process of saying goodbye. When Tom crossed over they gave us time to be with him in private. No for a moment we felt rushed or have a sense that these people where there for another euthanasia. Dr Kang and Monica were kind and compassionate all the way through. I can't imagine another way to part from our beloved one. I wish to all of you reader to consider also this service for the last day of your pet's life. I couldn't talk more highly of Dr Kang for everything he does for our pets and for how he runs his practice. A true gem of a person.<//Review>

Only didn't give 5 stars cause if it costs a lot I'm pretty sure you can't make payments. Other than that, I highly recommend.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf41e4b69fe5:0xb8f70651e7c25da0<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>Great experience ! Long story short, my new kitten got stung by a bee and my regular vet was not available. I called and got an appointment within 15 min, went and the vet gave my kittens some meds, I was in and out in 20 min, and the price was very reasonable. I highly recommend this veterinary practice !<//text></record>

Anytime I need to go to a vet I will always come back here. Great staff and great prices! Compared to a different vet, we got 3 cats checked out for the price of one.

Anyway we needed a place for walk ins today but our normal vet was down for two weeks due to technical issues. After calling 4 other vets in the area this was the first one that actually had walk in.

After we got in the staff was super polite and nice. They definitely seemed to enjoy their jobs and we're happy to help us. The vet Dr.Kang was amazing! Very funny during the checkup and he seemed to truly love animals and his job. He was also very professional too. He along would be worth going back even if it was more expensive!< /text>

<Review>Called to make my appointment after I noticed my kitty had blood in her stool. I love how close to my home Dr. Kang's practice is as car rides stress my cat out. His lobby is clean and calm. His exam rooms are clean as well and a good size with no places for kitties to crawl into and hide. The vet techs were so kind and gentle with my skittish kitty. Dr. Kang came in and we went over her health history. He asked many questions to get a thorough history and performed a routine exam. He was also very gentle with my kitty. He explained what may have caused my cat's stool issues and explained what the first treatment session should be. He started out with a simple blood test and a stool test which was reasonably priced. Dr Kang and his staff taught me how to administer some medicine for her. The next day, Dr Kang personally called me to go over her blood tests and explained everything clearly. My kitty is very healthy! ❤️ I also called to report my cat's vomiting after medication administration and Dr Kang called me back promptly to follow up and provide instructions. Thank you Dr Kang and staff for your kindness and compassion towards every animal and human that come to you for care.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>I would give this place a zero if I could. My dog was attacked, and I rushed him in into this animal hospital wrapped in a blanked and covered in blood. The girl over the counter looked at me and didn’t seem to care and made we wait in the lobby for 10 minutes. When she finally gave me a room the doctor came in and walked out to speak to her for another 10 minutes. The nurse returned and gave me an estimate for more than 1000 dollars for the surgery and I would need to leave my dog there for a day and a half. When I declined and tried to take the estimate the Dr hesitated and told me it was policy and he could not share the information??? I took my dog to a second vet and was charged below 500 for the surgery plus medication my dog was also returned in 2 hrs.

I do not know what they are thinking here but it seemed like this place likes to take advantage of the situation.< /Review>< pics>

< review>
I was recommended to Bamboo Reef by a colleague who is super into free diving and scuba diving. 'They are the one.' That was what she told me. After getting my open water certification with them, I would like to tell you, the folks looking into scuba, that Bamboo Reef is the one.

Big shout out to Kory, Katie for their excellent customer service, patience for all my questions about the diving equipment, and Ken, Brian for their diving wisdom. They were totally fine with going overtime on the lessons to ensure that we acquired the needed knowledge for diving.

I was quite nervous about the diving exam in Monterey as it would be my first actual ocean dive, but Frank and Mark had made my diving exam a wonderful experience. Besides the valuable tips/techniques they taught me, more importantly, they gave me a boost of confidence and scuba diving overall.

I will go back to them to advance my diving skills.</review>

I took the first part of the SSI photography class as a crash course for my new Sealife DC2000 camera before heading off to Fiji.  He took me from a complete novice, provided me skills to feel confident taking under water pictures and videos.  I surprisingly impressed other experienced photographers on my dive trip and they used a couple of my pictures for their next bulletin!  Looking forward to taking additional classes at Bamboo Reef.<//Review>

I just finished my open water diver certification with them and highly recommend this diving school and shop for scuba equipment purchases. Firstly Mark and Bamboo reef crew are welcoming and very helpful in briefing details of every equipment. They have the  best prices on gear.

I have no idea before starting the course was nervous about taking dive in the cold waters of Monterey but I am glad that my instructor (Mark Stanley) made it comfortable and in-fact joyful from very beginning to end.

They have organized schedule and tailored SSI online classes and honestly felt much safer during the pool and ocean diving. Mark throughly made sure we grasped all techniques and aspects of scuba diving. He is so patient and even extended his hand on my request to have an extra pool session before actual ocean dive.

Now I check my scuba certification process was an absolute dream which came true< /text><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

Very friendly staff and good experience dealing with Adam and Kory.

I always wanted to get certified for SCUBA but never had the chance to pull the trigger. Just one day at work, my colleague mentioned Bamboo Reef to me and she highly recommended it. I decided to give a try.

Everything went smooth until my first ocean session. I did not equalize my ear proper and it hurts a little. The instructor suggested I should wait for a couple of weeks to take the second session. Adam was also totally cool with it. I took my time to rest, then, unfortunately the COVID-19 came with the SIP order.

I almost forget I was not certified until November (half a year passed). I called them and they were able to pull my record quickly. No problem at all! They gave me another two ocean session without extra charge! As always , the sessions went smooth and my instructor Kory was super cool. The students have to wear 5mm gloves and still feel a little bit cold. However, Kory was totally fine with bare hand for a two hour dive!

It's my first time writing such a long review. I would high recommend them and SCUBA diving has so much fun.<//review>

My friend and I decided to take the SSI open water diver certification course with Bamboo Reef. This course consisted of:

-2 classroom Zoom sessions
-2 days of scuba training in their pool
-2 days of scuba training in the ocean

The instructors were absolutely amazing! They made the classroom sessions very engaging which helped me easily understand the physics of diving, the diving equipment, and diving safety protocols.

The pace of the pool sessions were also very manageable. Our instructor was precise with his lessons and made sure that we were comfortable with trying each exercise. He also contextualized the exercises by described the situations in which we might use the techniques we were practicing.

We did the ocean sessions in November so the water was somewhat murky in Monterey Bay (no more than 10ft visibility). I've heard it is better to go around August for maximum visibility. That being said, the ocean dives were amazing. It is definitely a bit more challenging to have to accommodate for the currents while simultaneously reproducing the exercises we had practiced in the pool, however, the instructors were calm, supportive, and never left me feeling as though I was out of my depth :p. On the last day my friend and I were given the opportunity to go on our own dive together without instructor supervision. This was by far one of the coolest things I've ever experienced. Its really wild to look down at your computer for the first time and see that you're 40ft under the surface. Also, I've never seen so many starfish in my life.

I would 100% recommend Bamboo Reef for anyone trying to get started with this awe-inspiring sport!<//Review>

<review>I had an awesome experience with Bamboo Reef. Their communication and flexibility with helping me schedule a dive tour on a day with good visibility was greatly appreciated.  I went out with Rosemary. She was an amazing dive guide, super patient and so fun to spend time with! She is also a marine biologist so she knows her stuff!  We saw so many cool sea creatures and she helped me work on my buoyancy which is something I have struggled with in the past. I would highly recommend Bamboo Reef!</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Friendly (and patient!) staff, with instructors that show the right balance of pushing you to succeed while also intuiting when students need more practice.

One thing to keep in mind - make sure that you take your time to get the right fit when you're buying your equipment. The staff are busy, but will take the time to do proper fits if you ask for it. Equipment exchanges accepted so long as they've only been tested in the pool.

Overall would recommend!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<review>I just finished my certification with Bamboo Reef. Spent time with several of the crew, but mainly Kory. The whole experience was super fun and professional which makes learning important and life saving skills a little easier. The ocean diving in Monterey is also well executed, and I look forward to going on some dive trips with Bamboo Reef in the future! Would recommend these guys and gals to anyone.< /review>< Pics>

Bamboo Reef was awesome! My wife and I learned how to dive at this center and they were amazing teachers. Some students were a bit slower to learn than others, but the instructors here were amazing and took their time with everybody. No corners were cut, and we feel fully certified and safe in the water with their instruction. The certification dive was also awesome! We saw a lot of stuff and had a great time. Definitely recommend!</Text>

If you want to dive, learn at Bamboo Reef (SF).
I wish I could give more stars to this team, I honestly cannot think of anything that they could improve... I’ve gone from not liking my face being in water, to being a level 1 Certified Diver.
The  team couldn’t have been more patient, fun and informative.
Thank you so much to the whole team: Mark, Kory, Rebecca, Paddy and Tim. I have had the best time, I cannot stop smiling,  and I look forward to continuing to improve.
An extra special thanks to Tim, who has been on every dive with me since day one, I owe you a medal!</text>

They have another shop in Monterey, so the process of doing the coursework in SF and the open water dives in Monterey is pretty easy and the instructors at both shops have all been friendly, informative and fun. They have weeknight and weekend classes, so it's pretty well tailored to city dwellers who want to get certified. I bought my minimal dive essentials through them, but haven't gone in for a fully diving system yet. Overall it's a great shop and I'm looking forward to checking out some of their fun dives and organized trips.</review>< Pics>

Great experience diving with Dennis!  We only had 2 divers + our divemaster on our Sunday morning dive for a small group of just 3 divers total.

The gear was in great shape -  I even got to use a brand new semi-dry suit, which kept me unbelievably warm.  Dennis made me feel extra safe. He went above and beyond by double checking our gear, doing detailed dive briefs, and sharing snacks between dives.

We dove Monastery, as place I've wanted to check out for a long time.  Water temp was about 48 degrees- chilling, but my entire body was comfortable thanks to Bamboo Reef's amazing gear.  We saw a 7ft wolf eel and some gorgeous soft corals, anemones, and jellies.  Great experience and will definitely be back!</text>

This was my son and I’s third dive trip with Bamboo Reef this year.  This is a terrific dive shop!
The dive guides are professional and enjoy what they are doing.  The dive briefings and safety protocols are very good.  We rented tanks, regulators, and wet suits.  All the equipment was in top shape.  They have everything set up when you arrive in the morning so be ready to gear up and go!
The shop personnel know the local area and weather patterns very well and can select the best location for visibility and sea conditions.  Fantastic experience with this dive shop.  We will be heading back again in August!<//Text>

Kory was particularly helpful in teaching me proper techniques and alleviating my stress, and Olivia and Tim showed us how awesome scuba diving can be in Monterey. The dives in the ocean gave us a chance to actually just use the equipment after we had passed all of the skills.

I was/am newly citified so I was a little nervous about going diving in a new place, solo, without people I knew, and with different gear than what I learned on. But, as soon as I got the the dive shop I was ecstatic. Despite not coming fully prepared with some gear and a mode of transportation, the employees were extremely accommodating and kind. My instructor was super friendly and genuinely seemed to be excited to dive with me. We did two dives and they were incredible. We saw beautiful fish, a shark egg with a swell shark inside, sea stars, sea cucumbers, sea lions, and even TWO sea otters! The highlight for sure was when the sea lions came up to us. Even though they came to us in short 3-4 second increments, it was magical. I highly recommend Bamboo Reef Scuba Diving Centers in Monterey! So much fun. I will never forget my experience!<//Text>

The instructors were very helpful and showed lots of patience with everyone in the group. They also offer diving trips and specialty classes. They have something for everyone and I felt safe the whole time. Couldn't be happier they are my Dive shop.<//text>

I took the Open Water Diver certification class with Mark Stanley through this shop and recently completed my five required dives in Monterey. I had a great experience and I would highly recommend this shop and this course to anyone looking to get certified.

The class itself was fun, useful, and appropriately priced. They follow the SSI program, and I feel like I had a far better experience than my friends had with PADI certifications. I was not nervous about going in the water, but the program built up to it slowly. This would be perfect for anyone apprehensive about SCUBA without being too slow for someone eager to get going.

On the checkout dives, I was initially nervous about the cold water in Monterey, but the semi-dry suit I was given fit perfectly and kept me perfectly warm throughout the weekend. Mark did an awesome job leading our group, explaining the plan for each dive, and pointing out cool critters. I felt safe, relaxed, and in control the entire time, and I had a great dive experience.

I cannot recommend this shop highly enough, and I'm excited to go diving again in Monterey, or on one of their many other trips to dive sites around the world.<//review>

I recently got the stress and rescue certification with Bamboo Reef. The instructor was extremelly generous with his time and knowledge, pushing us to improve our skill as much as possible, but keeping the class very fun and entertaining. I feel lucky to have found a place to take my diving skills to the next level. I will came back to Bamboo Reef to keep up my education without hesitation, and I really recommend this place for anybody who wants to learn scuba diving.</Text>

I have had a great time with everyone at this shop.  They make the certification process easy and fun.  They worked with me to get me the gear I needed and not just sell me their merchandise.  I ended up needing a custom suit and they recommended where to go and did not try to sell me a suit that would not work. I look forward to continuing my SCUBA education through Bamboo Reef.<//Review>

Got my upgrade credits and pool dives for Padi Suba diver to Padi open water here.

Gary Gardner, my coach, was just amazing!! He went out of his way to ensure that I have no issues with my Documents for open water dives at Catalina!!

Thanks Gary!! Really appreciate your help, highly recommend him as your instructor.

Mark, was very responsive at the office. Just absolutely amazing team!<//text>

<text>The open water certification with Bamboo Reef is ok. The instructors are great, but it’s pricey and requires a time commitment.

The class itself costs about $500, but they also require you to buy mask, snorkel, fins, booties and gloves which costs $200 - $400. You also needed to rent a car and book a hotel in Monterey for the ocean dive, which costs another $300. You can get certified in Hawaii for much cheaper.

It also takes two full weekends to get certified. Since they put you in a class with 10 people, all of the skills take a while to complete. Private lessons are much quicker, but also more expensive.<//text><response>{'time': 1521757591970, 'text': "We've already caught up with you on Yelp, Adam. We just wanted to reiterate  we have found after training thousands of people to dive, having personal equipment that has the right fit and comfort makes for a much more positive and safer experience in the pool and the ocean.  Rather than rushing someone through the pool skills our classes as designed to give everyone ample time to become comfortable, confident, and safe divers.  Other places rent a pool and are under time constraints to get everyone through the skills as quickly as possible.  There is no time to repeat and become comfortable with the skills.  While we find Monterey is a lovely place to finish your ocean dives. we're always willing to work with you to find another SCUBA-licensed facility where you can complete your training while on vacation. We hope this has addressed some of your concerns. Feel free to reach out to us directly if you have any more questions. -The Team at Bamboo Reef"}< /response></record>

Terrible customer service.  Unconcerned with customer effort going to Monterey by cancelling without directly contacting me other than vmail.  They could not be bothered to text or call a second time.  After leaving several messages with this company they never took initiative to contact me.  Untrustworthy and shady in their customer relations.  Use at your own risk.</Review>

When I walked in this place it looked really nice and well kept, very modern and clean, however that is the only good part about this place. They messed up my hair and did not listen to what I wanted. I asked for 2 inches off the top and they cut off about 4 leaving almost nothing on the top. I also requested a fade, but the fade was non-existent and the sides were uneven, to top it all off after they were done they combed my hair straight up and did not ask which way I part it which messed my hair up my because I was training it at the time.The hairstylist simply did what SHE wanted to do She did what she thought would good instead of doing what I wanted. I do not recommend coming here</Review>

I've had long hair since I was 12 (past my butt) and taking care of it was hard. I was afraid I'd instantly regret cutting it short but I trusted Anne to cut my hair and work her magic. She was understanding of my nerves and really listened to what I wanted. She even asked multiple times about what length. She took her time to pay attention to detail.
I feel amazing and I LOVE it. I will be going back to see her for upkeep.
Thank you so much Anne, you're an angel.

Great play. Wonderful staff to help, offer opinions when it comes to cutting one's hair. Always likes coming to get the cut. One downside is the price.</review>

I have been going to this location for a few years and every year I am less satisfied. My husband took my son in about a week and a half ago to get a hair cut and it was less than a job well done. I took him in today to get it fixed and the response I received from the stylist was unpleasant and unprofessional. She asked me why I waited so long to bring him in ( shocker I work) and that he was probably moving around too much. The ladies here never give you the style you ask for and rush the process to get the next person in. Don't go here if you want a decent haircut.<//review>

Gave this place a shot and was very impressed with the quality of work from Noreen.
For their price of men's haircut ($15), I usually get a dodgy result anywhere else, even with photos and explanation of what I want.
Here, I just had to show Noreen a couple of pictures  and she knew exactly what to do with my hair, without any debates regarding clip size numbers and such.
She's obviously an experienced professional, so I'm definitely coming back.</text>

I've had the worst experience cutting my hair at this place the other day. My hair is really curly so even for a trim, it would usually take 30 min. This lady Anne took 5 min and she just brushed my hair and cut a visual straight line. Now my hair has a trapeze shape and I kept telling her that and she was just insisting that layered hair will just add more volume, which I was not looking for. I felt something was wrong with the way she was doing it, but did not know how to tell her. In the end I was too embarrassed not to leave a tip, but she deserved $0.<//text>

I asked for a taper not a layer haircut(im a guy) I have so many zigzags on my head people are going to think its a new style of hair.  Sucks that you and your wife go to a "professional stylist" and they turn out to be worst than an amateur. Plus i had to pay them the full price for their mistake. We have made our decision not to ever go there. And change your name to "Bad Clips". Does anyone have a solution for hair growth.  It there was a no star option I would of chosen it. Oh well. Lesson learned<//text>

<text>A friend recommended it so I went in for a physical yesterday and today for the blood test result. Dr. Michael is indeed very thorough, exactly like what I've been told by the friend. He explained my results with much more details than the doctor I visited last year and discussed any concern I had. He also refereed me to a specialist to address a problem I have further for my benefits. Staff is very friendly and efficient in doing their work too.
PS. The parking in the building costed $17 for my visit even with 15 minutes validation from the pharmacy so it is pricey, just find street parking and walk over.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Review>DO NOT SEE THIS DOCTOR !!!

I was a patient of Doctor Michael for about 3 years. Recently I wanted to see the Doctor to discuss a few concerns. I called in to schedule an appointment and the earliest they would see me was 2 weeks later. I arrive that day for my appointment only to find out the Doctor didn't come to work that day so they rescheduled me for 10 days later. That day comes and I get another call saying the Doctor needs to reschedule again so I have to wait another 5 days. Today I finally was able to get my appointment.

After waiting quite a while in the lobby I get called in to see Doctor Michael. He asked me the reason for my visit and I told him I have a few different concerns I would like to discuss. After telling him my first concern, he prescribed me some medication then proceeded to stand up and start walking towards the door. I was immediately confused and said "Ok wait I still have a couple other things I wanted to discuss with you". His reply was "Ok let's walk and talk"...Basically deciding my session (Which was only about 3-5 minutes at that time) was over.

I walked into the hallway with him and at this point I just felt disrespected. I say to him "Doctor I'm a little confused. I made an appointment and have been waiting to see you for almost a month now. I came here to discuss multiple things with you. I would like if we could sit down and finish my appointment". He points to a room and says "Ok you can go ahead and sit down right there and talk to me while I'm here". Essentially saying he would talk to me from the hallway while I sat in the room. LOL

AVOID THIS DOCTOR AT ALL COSTS !!!< /Review><Rating>1</Rating><GmapID>0x80c2bb49fdb5c7fb:0xe4df4990b5dab03a< /GmapID><name>Matthew R</name>< pics>

Dr. Michael is an angel. He’s caring, super intelligent, and is a doctor that is on your side. Having been his patient for several years, he’s been an amazing GP for my wife and I, and I’m so grateful for his professionalism and healing knowledge.</text>

<review>Dr. Micheals is an outstanding, patient, attentive Doctor as I've ever known In fact I can honestly attest to feeling his full attention is dedicated to me, my issues whenever I'm communicating with or seeing him.   His experience, concern have seen me through recent surgery's and a few upcoming I am sure. My best referral of his professionalism .

Ps.
I'd like to add: OMG! What a bunch of sour grapes out there....
Brent IS REAL, HUMAN, ATTENTIVE, CARING, CONNECTED, INTELLIGENT, FOCUSED. His Staff is as HANDS ON AS they can be, considering his POPULARITY.
PERIOD.

I didn't believe the reviews at first but trust me when I went and meet Anita and Karen I immediately switched my doctor. They are rude, unprofessional, childish, and just straight manipulative. I just dont get it because the doctor is the nicest person Ive ever met but his staff are literal hellspawn. If you value your health and sanity stay away head the other reviews there are better doctors who actually care for there patients<//text>

<review>After going to the doctor for 13 years I appeared today for my annual physical. I was not allowed to be seen however until I paid a small balance of roughly $100. I asked if I could take care of that after confirming with my insurance what the charge was for however that request was denied. I did pay the $100 and asked for a copy of my file. That request was denied. I asked if I could wait to speak with Dr. Michaels to get a copy of the file and that request was denied. I was then asked to leave the office or they would call security to escort me out. I walked in as a patient And walked out feeling like a criminal. Do not go to this doctor. I am filing a complaint with the medical board today.< /review>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Terrible office staff. They are completely rude and they do not wear mask!!!!. They could care less about protecting patients. When I asked them to wear a mask . The staff practically laughed and said they did not have to because they’ve been tested. They then cancelled my appointment because they said the doctor had an emergency. I rescheduled four weeks later( that was the soonest availability they had). They cancelled that appointment as well! They pretty much said oh well and did not give reason .<//Review>

< review>
My experience w/Dr Michael was very pleasant.  He would get five stars for sure.  He was very personable and wrote all the referrals and RXs that were necessary.  As great as my experience w/him was, dealing with his office staff was far from it.  Referrals took weeks to be submitted, calls were NEVER returned, they said they'd do things they never did.  It took my medical group calling them multiple times to get one simple thing done.  I felt completely helpless. Couldn't get important prescriptions filled for chronic conditions and could get referrals to doctors I needed to see.  I will likely be looking for a new PCP, but this decision has nothing at all to do w/Dr. Michael which is really unfortunate ...</review>

Dr. Michael is the most Caring Dr. I have had the privilege of having taking care of my health needs. His calm and personal demeanor is above and beyond what I have ever experienced. I have never had issues with the the waiting time but, if ever I did I would not complain because he is worth the wait. I get his complete attention the entire visit. When I leave I feel very confident that he has completely covered my heath needs from head to toe. I would recommend him to anyone who wants is concerned or wants a Dr. to be concerned about their health.< /text>

I had my first visit with Dr Michael.  LOVED him. He makes you feel like a trusted friend or neighbor.   In the current circumstances he made the visit feel very safe.   Glad I picked him (it was mostly for proximity as I had no referrals to him) Great office staff as well.</Text>

Dr. Michael has been our family doctor for over 10 years. He has always been the main pillar in our family care; specially a few years ago when my father wouldn’t have been able to get through a very difficult period without his care. He always goes the extra mile. His staff is amazing. Anita, his nurse, always efficient, loving and caring. Aileen, in the front desk, always responsive and helpful. I’m very grateful to have them on our side.< /review>

I could literally write pages about Dr. Michael.

I thankfully met him and his staff over 13 years ago after I had been suffering from a serious lung infection for over a month that 2 other doctors had missed.- 1 due to being totally arrogant and thinking I just had a cold. I was burning up and so sick I could barely walk.  Dr. Michael took the time and actually listened to me - instead of just saying its probably just the flu (as the other doctors had done) or just a cold and sending me home, he actually did a complete physical on me an then had the intuition to order a chest x ray on me (I was not even coughing at the time) and then really looked at it and discovered that I actually had a really serious lung infection and started me on antibiotics. While this may sound like no big deal - it actually was, as he actually saw that it was not a normal looking lung infection and I later learned he went above and beyond and had a infectious disease specialist look at the x ray just to be safe and as he suspected it was even more serious. Since that day he has always been my main doctor. I would also like to add that I have a serious long term health condition and most doctors would generally attribute many of my current and past health issues to my main condition (it usually is the case) but Dr. Michael always looks at whatever is happening to me at the moment as if I was a new patient. This is probably his biggest talent and gift as a doctor as he has on more than one occasion over the years thought outside the box with me and has figured out quickly why I was sick at the time - sometimes it was minor but more than a few times it was really serious. His quick way of thinking and knowledge and intuition is what kept me from getting sicker and going into the hospital.

If you are looking for a doctor that actually treats you like a person and not a number then see this man.

I am not a celebrity or a wealthy person - far from it - but he treats me like I am - many Vets like myself go to the VA and its a great blessing but I just do not have the energy to go there as its so big. Dr. Michael is seriously brilliant and really patient and I am truly thankful I found him.< /review>

I would highly not recommend Dr. Michael for treatment/healthcare. Because instead you play a cat and mouse game with Anita & Karen(nurse & receptionist) who make it impossible to speak to the doctor THAT YOU PAY FOR!!! The staff suck just look at the previous reviews. The doctor says one thing and the staff say something else avoid.</Review>

Dr. Michael takes the time to explain the meaning of medical terms and test results in a way that a lay person can understand. He is very thorough and answers any question that you may have. His staff is also very professional and competent at their tasks. Given a choice, I wouldn't go anywhere else.<//review>

Dr. Michael is an intelligent caring human being who is focused on positive outcomes.  He has a great ability to synthesize the details of lab results and other tests into preventive measures.  I greatly respect his approach to care.<//Text>

Michaels, I have experienced three visits with him and in the future if it needed I would like to see him only. He's very courteous takes his time with his patients make sure you understand completely about what is going on with your health, and what we will do to work I'm getting your health to 100% again. He answers all questions as best you can so that you fully understand. He's very thorough knows all about your history , and what I like the most about dr. Michaels is that if he puts you on any type of new medicine he checks on you after you've been taking it a couple days to make sure you're not having any bad side effects he makes a personal phone call to you now that is what I say is a good doctor I would recommend him highly. So I give you a thumbs up you're the greatest. Oh and as well the staff in his office are very very fast efficient nice pleasant excellent office skills very helpful thumbs up to you ladies thank you very much your patient Miss newby.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

To tell the truth I don't want to give this place 1 star.It would be a negative rating!!! I went in to have a physical and Dr Michael claims i had a heart attack and wanted to run all these test. I had 4 unnecessary test done. According to another Doctor my EKG was fine and didn't warrant all these other test. I went in to get the results of one of the test and he created a reason to have more test ran!!!
I was charged for an office visit and he didn't even have the results in my chart for the other test. He went to ask the nurse for them and never came back in the room.
He also wanted me to come in once a month and be charged for a doctors visit just to get a refill on my medication. who does this stuff???

DO NOT GO TO THIS DOCTOR!!! HE IS THE WORSE!!<//Review>

I feel fortunate to have enjoyed Dr. Michael as my primary GP for over 6 years and have found him to be extremely trustworthy, personable, knowledgeable, honest, thorough, compassionate and non-judgmental. He takes the time to talk to you and to listen to all of your concerns. Dr. Michael is someone you can talk with and he really cares about each one of his patients. He listens and provides suggestions.  A patient couldn't ask for a more caring physician than Dr. Michael. The entire office staff is extremely friendly,  personable and accommodating. Dr. Michael is a great doctor, mentor and friend. I'm glad I have him as my primary care provider!

Dr. Michael takes time to listen, diagnose, and prescribe the best treatment possible.

Brent Michael is by far the worst doctor I have encountered. I took my son here who just turned 18 for a physical. He ordered a bunch of unnecessary testings, a pulmonary function test, bunch of lab work, and a heart ultrasound. I have repeatedly left messages and wrote a letter, back in January and still have yet to get a response from the doctor. Stay away from this crook, even the doctors in our community say he is a MONSTER!!! Doesn't even have the decency to return calls unless you come in! I have asked his office to produce the heart ultrasound study on a disk so that I can have a Cardiologist review his findings, his office or technician said they use an OLD software and cannot re-produce the study...have you heard that one before???</Text>

I'm sorry to write such a negative review as Michael appears to be a genuinely nice person, but it also appears that he orders unnecessary tests in order to bill the insurance and my experience was really awful.  I was 32 weeks pregnant when I visited him to get a wart removed. Like many of the reviews here, he then ordered a number of test that I did not need, want or request (luckily my insurance did cover them but I understand many people were lumped with huge bills for tests they did not order).

One of the tests was a heart echo. He came in with the results shaking his head saying 'I hate giving results like this' which immediately made me fell worried. He then asked me if I had ever been told I had a hole in my heart and that he thought the test was indicating I may have a hole in my heart. He went into a huge amount of detail about this condition and how serious it could be. He also said that I may now be a 'high risk pregnancy' and that I should not do any exercise. I was incredibly shaken by this news.  He finished the session by saying ' I don't want you to go into shock when you leave here so remember you are pre-diagnosis'. But honestly after all this dramatic language about 'i hate giving news like this' and how bad the condition is, I was totally rattled.

He sent me to my OB to get a referral for a specialist. My OB was very confused by the referral as she didn't see any indication from the echo results that I had a hole in my heart. She called his office multiple times to discuss and they were incredibly rude, saying he would not call her back. I tried to call his office and they said no he won't call them. Two visits to a heart specialist and $400 later... it was confirmed I have a totally healthy heart and Dr Brent totally misinterpreted the results. My heart specialist said his dealing of the results was totally inappropriate and wrong. He should not be interpreting these kinds of results, and if he did suspect a condition he should have simply asked that I see a specialist to review the results, rather than presenting such a dire prognosis. The whole thing was a a stressful ordeal, particularly when pregnant. DO NOT GO!!< /review>

Dr. Michaels is easy to talk to, down-to-earth as well as smart and competent. It feels more like you’re getting good advice from a personal friend who is also a licensed physician.

I have been recommending him to friends and family for years now and with absolutely no complaints. He is always able to fit me into his schedule and help me as promptly as possible.  I haven’t had to wait more than twenty minutes after checking in to see him.

He is very knowledgeable and polite and is willing to answer all of my questions without being rude or cold.

Thanks Dr. Michaels!< /Text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Text>**** PLEASE DO NOT VISIT THIS DOCTOR ******
My experience has been horrible at this place. This guy is arrogant and over smart. They have some pretty bad practice going on here to cheat patients and make money. To top of it, his staff Anita (nurse) and Christian (billing person) want to dupe you and cheat you out of money. They don't have any sense of how to talk to patients/ customers - horrible people I have dealt in my life, especially Christian.

I had gone for a treatment for a boil on my thigh. The doctor comes and inspects it and I told him that I used a fungal powder on it. He started his degrading talk of how I shouldn't have done that if I didn't know anything about it and how big mistake I have done - I saw arrogance at his best!

Then his nurse, Anita asked me if I want to do medical check up such as chest xray, blood test, urine etc. I told her I am not here for that. She said it's free and covered by insurance. I said ok. After a month I get a call from billing agent for huge amount for all the tests. I told her this should have covered by insurance and she said no - this is what i owe. I told her, first of all I had not visited doctor for all the tests they billed me for. I only agreed to do the tests because the nurse Anita told me that they are free and covered by insurance. Christian then told me to resolve it with my insurance. I called up my insurance and they told me that the medical office has done wrong bill coding and they need to correct it.  I passed on this message to Grace, office manager, (only nice person in that office) and she said she will take care of it. After that I set up a reminder to call the every week diligently to follow up if the insurance took care of it. After a month, I get bill from the hospital for small amount which I paid online. I then called up Grace to check if that was the final amount I owed and she said yes. I was happy that it was over, but to my surprise I get a call from Christian saying that I still owe them the original amount and if I don't pay it will go to collections. She was rude and giving me threat on the phone to pay or get hit with credit score. I called up the insurance and got on conference with her. The insurance asked her to rebill it and she said no, I have to pay that amount! I called her back many times but Christian kept hanging up on me saying that she doesn't want to talk to me. SCAM TO SUCK UP MY MONEY! I am not going to let this go easily. I am going to sue them and complain to medical association about the malpractice this doctor's office follows to cheat people!</Text>< Gmap_id>

I book an annual physical with zoc doc and like others, took a bunch of tests that I shouldn't have taken because its not covered w/insurance. Then comes a $265 dollar bill that he doctor personally refuses to change because he "claims" i got a BC prescription which isn't true. I have been calling the office, insurance, and billing every month for the past 8 months and this still hasn't been taken care of.

There is a woman below me with the exact same story and people on yelp with the exact story. AVOID THIS DOCTOR AT ALL COSTS!!

also they overbook and you have to wait forever.

<Text>I went to Dr. Brent Michael for a routine annual exam, on 3/25/13.  My internist of 18 years had retired, and I needed to find a new doctor.  A work colleague recommended Dr. Michael.  The exam experience was okay.  They performed a bone density exam, which I had never had done before, so it was nice to get the results of that.  However, they performed 7 lab tests (mostly all related to thyroid, such as TSH) on blood drawn for what I thought would be routine blood analysis.  When I received a very large bill for this blood work-up, I called my insurance company because my annual exams are covered 100% (no co-pay or any out-of-pocket).  Blue Cross told me that thyroid lab tests are not preventative and therefore not covered.  Dr. Michael also recommended that I return to his office the next day for a carotid ultrasound.  Because my prior internist had never done a carotid ultrasound, I asked my boyfriend (a tenured professor at the UCLA School of Medicine), who informed me that this test is very controversial, and because I'm very healthy (I'm a runner w/ low cholesterol, low BP, low heart rate) this test isn't indicated for me.  So, I cancelled this exam.  However, for a year and a half Dr. Michael's office has been harassing me for payment of the thyroid tests, despite two letters written by me explaining that they should never been ordered because I don't have thyroid problems and they are not preventative and therefore not indicated in a routine annual exam.  Dr. Michael's office ignored my letters; continued to call me on a monthly basis; and then sold the debt to a debt collections company.  The debt collections company called today; I explained the situation; they agreed thyroid tests should not be ordered unless indicated; but nevertheless said they would report me to all the credit reporting agencies today if I didn't pay today.  All in all, this has been the worst physician visit of my entire 49 years. A true nightmare.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND DR. MICHAEL.  I THINK HIS ORDERING OF TESTS THAT WERE NOT INDICATED IS TANATMOUNT TO FRAUD.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Text>Diverse, colorful and fun products. You can find a fantastic outfit here for Pride, Burning Man, Folsom, Circuit Parties, Holiday, Cruises, Festivals, Raves etc.
Support small businesses like this one. They have policies inside for your protection and theirs like wearing masks still and holding bags behind counter to avoid the many thieves on Castro.<//Text><userid>115780927150516452462< /userid>< Rate>

We encourage you to reach out to SF city leaders and tell them to clean up the streets and actually prevent crime so we don't have to require our staff do the extra effort to not only store clerks, but police, security guards AND BAG check staff, all in one."}<//response>

Knob’s amazed me over and over and over again as I walked through the store and spoke to the staff. I love this place! While there were things there that I could only wish for given my bank account is limited, there were many wonderful things there that are affordable for me. I know that there are going to be so many other things I’m going to want to buy the next time I go and look I forward to buying a bunch of them.</review>

The clothes are funky and fun, and inexpensive, but also inexpensively made.  Most of the sales boys are cute and super flirty though, so it makes up for it<//text>

This review will be on other pages as well . I purchased two thin cotton zipped hoodies by alternative for  $112 or so . Day 1 I chose to wear one home ,   Next morning i notice the material is already full of loose cotton balls . It looks like something purchased 5 months ago not a day after Bring worn once and less than a couple of hours . This is why I stick to online purchasing .  I called to speak to someone but instead I was connected to a worker at 615pm or so that just gave me attitude . His words were ; Are you done complaining !  who talks to customers like that ? He's the one who works for a living . Not me , he needed to refrain from his omg ! Felisha attitude , I just wanted my money back , not attitude from a queen .< /text>

Customer service is horrible. Their "appointment system" doesn't do anything. I called and made an appointment, waited an hour. They don't bother letting you know how long the wait. They ask what you need and then dismiss you. Not worth it. Never coming here again. Other people without appointments come in and get seen before you. When asking them how long they just dismiss you.<//Review>

Worst service. I made an appointment and they still accepted people ahead of me. These people came after me. Never returning. Telling others to not go here anymore either. They deserve less than a star.<//Review>

<Review>I started with Lee for color.  He asked questions and spent time asking questions so he could clearly understand what I wanted.  He used color swatches and educated me on my skin tone, etc.  He did an amazing job and was a lot of fun!<//Review><user_name>Theresa Moore</user_name><Resp>None</Resp>< rating>

I have been going here for years.  Sunny is the best one there.  She always takes good care of me.  She is friendly and is gentle when working with my hands.  She makes sure I walk out from there happy and satisfied.<//text>

If you’re looking for the best BMW place in Los Angeles, look no further.  I have had a lot of work done at the M Shop  on my 2013 BMW. They do absolutely fantastic work, are always on time for my early morning appointments and get me out of There on time or earlier than predicted.  The work has been, no complaints at all and I recommend to all of my friends with BMWs  to go there without any qualms. And I have never heard a complaint from them either. Everyone is really nice they explain things very well at your level of understanding and  don’t rip you off like the dealer does. I  have had both maintenance work and  A major job performed and they do it all brilliantly. I highly recommend the shop.<//review>

The staff at the M Shop (particularly Cassie and Paolo) were proactively communicative and provided a clear assessment and plan for my car repair.

They had me scheduled in a timely and convenient manner and provided advice tailored to my situation with explanations for why they were suggesting certain work be done.

I would highly recommend the M Shop to any of my friends/family and will happily return to the shop in the future.</Text>

<text>Joe and the gang are the only place I trust to go with my 75 BMW 2002. These guys know bimmers, old or new, and I highly recommend them. They maintained my car when it was stock and have helped me build out a hot rod with an engine swap. They do it all. These guys are honest and hard working and are very up front with repairs and expectations. Joe is a true enthusiast and if he’s not in the shop you’ll find him at a vintage BMW show. They live and breathe this stuff.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I'm happy I found this place. You can't trust just anyone with a BMW. I had taken my older BMW to some random mechanic to get worked on and he just didn't do the job correctly. I found the M shop online and it had great reviews. I've been taking my BMWs here for over 3 years now and i have never had an issue. My brother also brings his BMW here. Great shop!< /review>

<time>1567912747645<//time><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I can't recommend the folks at The M Shop highly enough.  After visiting a Mini Cooper Specialist on the westside and getting a ridiculous quote and generally bad advice, I went to this shop much closer to home to service my 2009 Mini Cooper S and I'm super happy that I did! From the start they have taken the best care of my car without any attempts to sell me repairs I don't need or scare me into fixing things that aren't in my list of priorities. They are super knowledgeable and helped me prioritize the repairs needed after buying my first used Mini Cooper. Their customer service is on point. They assess your car, analyze what needs to be done, communicate quickly and clearly and then follow through with solid repairs. It's hard to find a trustworthy repair shop to begin with but The M Shop takes trust and customer care to a new level. Thanks M Shop! I'll keep bringing my Mini back!</Review>< pics>

I've been taking my 2004 Mini Cooper to these folks for almost 10 years now. They're straight forward and honest with their estimates and pricing.  If it's something they can fix at low/no cost, they will, while being very clear what they're doing. Most importantly, they care and enjoy what they do.< /review>

The M Shop is nothing less than amazing!  My wife and I have been taking our BMWs there for many years now and we have never had a bad experience.  Joe, Paulo, Jon and the rest of the crew are not just nice, not just good, they are truly trustworthy.  More often than not, they have recommended holding off on a repair because it was not needed.

There is nothing better than being able to trust your mechanic, and there is no other place I trust with my car than the M Shop!< /review>

<Review>These folks have been taking care of my car for over eight years now and they have *always* done an excellent job. They are thorough, honest, always perform the work within the quoted price and time frame.

I will always remember the time when I showed up late one evening with a dead battery and Joe replaced my battery even though the shop had already closed.

These folks are truly the best in the business--I have absolutely no hesitation recommending them to anyone who owns a BMW or Mini. The only thing is that they are very busy so call them in advance to make an appointment.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2c167098bd9d9:0x84c3b38044d305fb</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was recommended this car shop by a friend that also had a bimmer that that time. I have been taking mine there since then! :D

So, these guys are BMW/Mini specialists. So if you have a car of any of those two brands, this is the place you wanna go from now on.

The prices are more than reasonable and the people working there is always nice and helpful. If you ask for information or recommendations about accessories for example, they would send you and email with all the information they can provide (thanks Jon!).

Last time we were there it was another amazing experience. We took the car for a check/maintenance way ahead of the regular one just because we have a road trip coming and we wanted to make sure that everything was OK. When we were leaving the car, we noticed that there was paint from another car in the left side of the front bumper. It was probably in the supermarket parking lot that someone may have do a wrong maneuver and bump our car while we were shopping. We left the car and went to have breakfast to a close coffee shop (lemon poppy kitchen, another great place) but we were all the time worried about the cost of taking the car to a body shop to get that fixed. So, around 45 minutes later we get the call from Paolo that car was ready. And you know what? He went ahead and removed the other car paint from the bumper (it turned out it was superficial) and made it look like new! And that is not the best part! Since we are existing customers, they gave us the "Free Christmas inspection" promo that we were not even aware of, so we pay NOTHING! Really! $0. Just amazing!

If you are looking for a place that will take great care of you car and will not charge you crazy amounts of money, then this is the place for you! Stop going to wherever you go and start going to The M Shop!

Oh, call in advance. Appointments only and they do have lot of customers. So I would recommend to call at least 2 weeks before.< /Text>

I am cautious about who works on my car as my OCD gets the best of me. As a car enthusiast I want the best with my M3. I want someone who enjoys cars to work on them. I got the best service with these guys, they know their stuff! I would definitely recommend it to any owner with a BMW or M car< /text>

Go to BMW repair shop, they try to keep things honest and straight forward. They will of course sell you things you sort of need but can wait on.</Text>

<Review>Super well organized and friendly office. The office is clean. They’re on time. I have always felt like the staff and Dr. Talwar are focused on making sure they’re doing what is best for me and that they care. In particular, I want to give a shout out to Messiah who is my hygienist. Every cleaning she gives me feedback on how I am brushing and areas I am missing. I’ve never had a hygienist teach me so much about how to properly brush. I used to think that I just got a lot of cavities, but now I’m realizing that while I faithfully brushed twice a day, I needed to do a better job of covering all the areas. I just really appreciate the great care they provide and that they help me take better care of myself in between cleanings.<//Review>< pics>

I broke a tooth & was able to get an appointment very quickly. Dr. Talwar created and installed a crown the same day. It was a painless procedure & he explained each step.  The entire staff was  wry friendly.< /Review>

I actually enjoy going to the dentist at Dr. Talwar's office!  Went today for a teeth cleaning with a new (to me) hygienist, Ally (sp.?). Dr. Talwar is always fun to talk to, kind, and gentle.  Allly fit in well with his office.  I really lijked my other regular hygienist, Terry, too.< /text>

The food was pretty good.  The chicken curry had way more chicken than I expected but I think the coconut milk was cut with something else, broth maybe.  Whatever, it was good.  The fried rice was okay.  The restaurant itself had a funky smell, and didn’t seem overly clean.  The wait staff was friendly and fast.  I’d probably go back, but will probably look for another option.<//Text>

< Review>
The food was good and a lot though I've had better Thai food. We're not used to give a percentage tip in Holland so when we didn't give enough (15% on top of the total) the response was a bit unfriendly. It was just a mistake from our side not being used to tips. The pad thai was really good.</Review>

Authentic Thai food experience! Price is affordable and you get a authentic Thai dinner worth every buck!

Cost you $10.95 for a Basil Pork Dish, add a $3 for a bowl of plain ice enough for one (; You also pay additional 20cents for to go carrier .< /review>

<text>I have been waiting over 3 years to come back to this restaurant.  It was well worth the wait. I was worried that the food might be different under new management  but it was still great. Service was great. Decor well not so nice.</text>< Pictures>

Place - It is easy to find. There are lots of tables inside. Good for large group. Clean interior.

Taste - I ordered a wanton soup and lunch menu.

* Wanton soup - I thought it is wantin noddle soup but it was just wanton soup. There were avfew wantons, a few vegies and few meat. The amount was too small. My boyfriend ordered it and ate all for few minutes. If u want a meal, it will be better to order wanton noddle soup.

Taste was soso. Nothing special. The quality of wanton and soup was not really good.

* Lunch combo -Lunch combo was btw 11am to 5pm. I could choose one appiti and meat. It came with egg fried rice and noddle. I picked chicken satay and pad kraw(beef). The dish was good! Especially, chicken satay was greally good. Others were also good but overall little salty.

Service and Price - Service was good but little slow. Price was reasonable.<//review>

<time>1581732141518<//time><Rating>2<//Rating><Text>We chose Old Siam due to it's amazing proximity to our hotel and the amount of vegetarian options available compared to other Thai restaurants nearby. However, we feel it was a bad choice. I knew going in not to expect very high class service, but we weren't even offered water. We had to ask for it outright once the food came. The food itself was not very good. The fried rice was lacking salt, or some similar seasoning, badly. It was extremely bland. The pad Thai was slightly better but nothing to write home about. Also our table of 2 had an automatic 18% gratituity added, which wasn't advertised at all, and we found extremely strange. The only good thing I can say it that it was quick.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Taste of the food was fair.Not very expensive . The restaurant is open till late.They have vegetarian options and the rest of the menu was customizable.The seating is kind of congested. Closely spaced tables. The server didn't ask us about our preferred spice level.We found the food bland.Rest no complaints!<//Text>

This place is busy and a bit old looking but the food is delicious. I had the shrimp curry with a side of rice. A bit pricey for dinner for one. $14+$2 = $16. Still, the food is was prepared well, the shrimp had a good ‘spice’ to them and the rice was perfect. Recommend this place for a quick bite after a night out on the town.</Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>Nice location and staff is also very pleasant. I wanted to go because they had a beef stew, which is not your normal Thai food on the menu. And it was pretty good and so was the price, $7.00 I think, not bad. They also have large bottles of Chang beer which is also hard to come by. Another awesome thing they had at each table is your own condiment caddy, which had vinegar, chili, sugar. This how it is normally served in Thailand, you make the taste you like.</Text>< Pics>

It's better to save your money and go across the street and eat at Kin Khao, tastes a lot better and is more packed. The waitress at old Siam is very rude<//text>

Good and authentic thai food for those who want real thai taste. If you like hot and spicy food, Kuey Tiew Pad Kee Mao is highly recommended.</text>

Pretty good thai food in a fairly small space. We ordered an appetizer and two entrees. Confusingly, the entrees came before the appetizer. After reminding them, they brought the appetizer without an apology or concern.</review>

<review>The saving grace for this place is the food. Although we ordered the same thing. My husband and I, the portion sizes were very much different.  The service is usually good. This time they were extremely slow with less than 50% capacity.  Not usually like them. I would go back, but geesh speed it up! You only get so much time for lunch.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Worst Thai Restaurant ever. Food was average  but service was horrible. We were seated down and in less than a minute they asked us, are you ready to order. Nobody refilled the water at all and a tip was placed on the bill. Overall service was really horrible and really money hungry.<//Text>< Time>

This restaurant is a ripped off. Beware of your bill and the final bill. They charge you tax and 18% gratuity upfront. The 18% gratuity is part of the 1st bill. 2nd time she will bring you another bill and show blank on the gratuity section and need your signature. Dont fall for it.<//Review>

Taste was excellent and food was well prepared. Service was speedy and friendly. Less expensive than Million Thai and equally tasty. Less crowded and noisy than Bangkok Thai and this place takes credit cards. I'd say it was the best of the 3.<//review><gmapID>0x8085808f79eabf8d:0x8823d9ca2b0a427<//gmapID>< response>

Prompt, efficient, and courteous service in a casual and non-intimidating environment.  HUGE portions, and amazingly flavorful no matter the dish.  I went back a second time to try other dishes and was completely satisfied both times.  Casual atmosphere, surprisingly inexpensive.  Highly, highly recommended.<//text>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>We went here late on a Friday night to eat some food after a long day of travel.  We were seated pretty quickly.  It's definitely a "hole in the wall" type place---nothing to get dressed up to the nines for.   The dishes are decent sizes and the food is pretty good.   The service can be a little slow, but shouldn't stop you from eating here.   For an affordable dinner that will leave you full, you can't go wrong with this Thai food.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x8085808f79eabf8d:0x8823d9ca2b0a427</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great place with tasty food. Arrived alone at peak time on a Sunday eve. No problem they said and soon called my name. They accommodated me without fuss. At request beer came first (usually Asian or Indian restaurants tend to bring meals all at once). Greatly recommend for the cleanness of the place, fast service, friendly approach and of course food was authentic thai. Loved it.< /review>

Very rude waitress and at the end they forced a undeserving tip and didn’t inform us that the tip was already added to the receipt. Worst Thai Restaurant. Never going there ever again.</text>

Delicious food - the spicy drunk man noodles was delicious and the shrimp roll appetizer. Came here cause the Thai place across was packed but they hit the spot too.< /review>

Found this place on a whim and it was amazing! Tom Yung Goon soup and Pad Thai were delicious. Super fast service and satisfying. As good as I've eaten in Thailand.<//review>

A bit sceptical when arriving to the restaurant (a bit like an old diner from the outside). But when we get inside the smell of good food was incredible and then when food arrived the good impression was confirmed.
Great food, friendly team and very good price!! Don't hesitate to try the sticky mango rice as desert (too yummy)!< /Text>

Terrible. Go some place else. Pad that was very dry. The order was also wrong. I ordered shrimp and chicken and got only chicken. Also I ordered satay and paid for it but did not receive it.< /Text>

<review>The old Siam saved my vacation in San Francisco,

From the first time I entered that door I returned for more, have been there every day throughout my entire stay( 8 times)
The service is awesome, attentive and fast, they are really flexible on tweaking the dishes and special requests are not turned down.
The portions are of decent size and it is a lot of value for the money.
Flavours are authentic and i did linger on the taste.

Thanks guys and girls

The panang curry I ordered was good, but not the best I've had. It was just a bit too thin, though the spice was nice. My wife enjoyed her yellow curry. The staff was friendly and attentive, there was no wait to be seated and the place was clean.</text>

Very good chicken satay, egg rolls, and bbq chicken. The lunch special we had was abundant, and even the fried rice, while simple, was very good. My new fav Thai restaurant in SF, and we just walked in out of the rain by accident.</text>

This place was OK. I tried a pork belly meal. The pork was low quality, and in general I did not really like the dish. The staff was great and very attentive though. Probably would try it again if I'm in town. Very convenient I'd you're staying in Union Square.<//text>

<review>Waitress was rude.  Good food.   They added tofu and I had asked for none politely, They forgot my lime, so I asked for one, reluctantly she got it, then I noticed I had no utensils so i asked for chop sticks- she barks back-"ANYTHING ELSE?!" As if I had forgotten the items.   They are busy because the food is good but service needs IMPROVEMENT.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Shocking attitude and approach to customer service!!
I ordered 2 dishes for take out, both $10 on the menu. They charged me $12 for each and when I pointed out the price on the menu they just said it’s an old menu, even though there was a whole stand full of them.
I spoke to “Yam” who was not willing to resolve the situation in any shape or form. When I asked to speak to the manager, she just said “there’s no one here”. (As if!)
Such a shame that the staff were not willing to honour the price on the menu. Terrible attitude and poor approach to service. I will spend my money elsewhere!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<text>I was ordering to go. Phad Thai with tofu $12- only had 3 pieces of tofu! Tamarind flavour wasn't right. It wasn't terrible but it was barely Phad Thai.
$8 for x4 tiny egg rolls.
This was a late night hotel room fix. Did the trick.< /text><UserId.>103485549458724391583< /UserId.><Date>1531718809137<//Date><gmap_id>0x8085808f79eabf8d:0x8823d9ca2b0a427<//gmap_id>< rate>

The curry lamb is good, but the pork belly is over cooked thus hard to swallow. Mongo has some live fish taste that I try not to think the reason. Service is not quite accessible during peak hours.<//Review>

<Gmap_id>0x8085808f79eabf8d:0x8823d9ca2b0a427</Gmap_id><text>We wanted to try something away from our regular places down at Union Square so we started just walking around.  Not really sure what we wanted to eat, decided that we couldn't go wrong with Thai food.  They have a lunch menu on the weekend, which I rarely see anywhere.  I got the Spicy Moo Krob which is a crispy pork belly with green beans and bell peppers.  My daughter got their beef noodle soup.  We shared an order of the Siam wings, I was expecting the fired wings that you dipped in the sweet sauce, this was fried then stir fried with the sauce.  The pork belly was dry, hence the 3 stars.  Service is good here and there's a stream of customers coming in and out.  I'll come back, my daughter said her noodle soup was very good, and I want to try that.< /text></record>

I couldn't even eat the food!
I ordered fried egg rolls and pad Thai. Really easy food.
The rolls seemed they have been fried in an very old oil and the noodles seemed cooked in an unwashed pan cooking different dish with different tastes.
The service was so-so.
The waitress offered 10% discount: I had barely ate 3 spoons...
First time I'm going to a super well rated restaurant and it end up being a disappointment.</Review>

Great food and great price. The Tom Kha, pad Thai, and Green curry were great. $10-$15 plates, $8 soups.< /Review>

Tbis place is delicious! I ordered the chicken green curry amd stramed rice. It came out literally steaming, so hot and fresh. The green curry is the perfect blemd of spice and amooth flavor, just the way I like it. Such yum. On top of that, the service was impeccable. Pair all that with a prime location just minutes from Union Square and all the action in the Tenderloin district, and this place has the makings of a prime pre-game spot for a Saturday night on the town.<//Review>

Had their Tom Yum soup and Spicy Thai Pad Se-ew noodles.  Good food and quick.  Weird shape to layout, kitchen right by the front door and servers and customers cramped into small waiting space.  Overall good.</review>

The food is ok, the service is not worth their service charge. Because the waitress took off my food which I haven’t finished yet. And they put the bill on our table when we are still having the meal. I ‘m not comfortable in that restaurant and I won’t sugess my friends ,too.</review>

I got a lunch set with panang curry and chicken satay. They somehow got it wrong and brought me some grilled meat instead of curry. I called the waitress to let her know I got the wrong dish and they took it back to change it. The curry bowl was so small and with just around 6 or 8 bites of chicken breast. The taste of the food was good though.< /review>

When they mess up my order, they are always rude.  Sometimes they don’t make it extra spicy, if I bring it back they add extra spice, but burn it in the process.  If you ask to speak to the manager,  “ there isn’t one.”  I order shrimp pad Thai Extra spicy, with extra shrimp.  Tails off... sometimes they get it right sometimes it’s WRONG< /review>

Food was ok. However, the service left a lot to be desired. After we sat down,  it took 20 minutes for someone to take our order. Once we ordered, it took another 20 minutes to get our food. I tried the raspberry lemonade and it was un-drinkable.  I'd maybe use them again for takeout only.</Text>

< Review>
Very disappointing experience.  Upon entering the restaurant,  we were completely ignored by the staff. The ignorance of this staff was so perverse that i questioned whether I have actually become invisible!!!!  At that time there was a group of 3 young men seated on the bench waiting.  After approximately 10 minutes another set of diners entered. They were immediately greeted and asked about seating preference. When I calmly pointed out this unfair, discriminatoty and blatantly racist behavior to the hostes, she remained indifferent and unapologetic. I pray for her soul.< /Review>

Never been here before but was in the area and needed some dinner on the cheap side.  Twas about 6:30PM on a Monday and there were not many diners when I sat down (it filled up a bit while I was there).  Service was good and everyone was quite friendly.  The atmosphere was low key and relaxed.

I went for the pad thai and a Tsingtao.  Came to $13 and change. The only option for the entree was shrimp and tofu, which was fine with me, but I only got four shrimp or so (i think) and most still had the tail on.  I really should learn to ask for the tails to be removed.  There were very few peanut crumbs, served on the side with a small garnish of cabbage.  The noodles themselves were a little on the rubbery side and clumped together a bit, especially towards the bottom of the plate.  Considering the service, the touristy area, and the prices, I considered the meal adequate.  I was not expecting fine dining.</Text>

The only thing this place has going for it is the prices are all around $10. Downright rude service, misleading menu items and average quality food makes me discourage anyone from gong here.< /Text>

It was OK I liked the food because there was no cilantro on it... but they were very late serving the food and also asking and it was almost empthy...
The price it is very good i thought it was going to be much more expensive but it wasn't!<//Text>

its a very very bad experience having dinner in this restaurant. the staffs are so rude. we have been waiting too long for our food to come, and after we have done our meal. the soup was not even ready and when we were finished eating and ask for the bill we asked them to cancel the tom yum soup and sorry was not even the first word that come out. they just checked served us the soup which we didnt want to have it anymore. when we asked for the bill. we thought that the service is not up to our standard so we left few coins of our change in the table. after we came out the staff chased us asking us to pay the TIP which its up to us wheter we want to give it or not. we know that we have to pay at least service charge we left our money on the table but the staff asked us to pay more. why must we give you TIP if you didnt deliver such a good sevice? if you want people to pay the service charge then you should put a service charge and NOT chasing your customer for not paying TIP as much as you want!< /Review>

<response>None</response><rate>4<//rate><Review>Really kind, attentive, service-focussed employees at this tasty old-school Thai restaurant.Went here on a recent Friday night for dinner with a friend, sister and infant and were promptly seated and attended to. Two of us got the large bowls of pho-like "fresh beef" (we guessed, seemingly correctly, that "fresh" was code word for "raw") soup, in which they kindly replaced noodles with various vegetables, which also had a surprising, and happy, quantity of tender beef tendon in it. The broth was flavoursome, complex, with notable flavours of star anise and Szechuan pepper. It was a bit on the salty side, but delicious.
We also got the pad see ew with chicken, and liked its layered tastes and the chewiness of the wide rice noodles. The total for the 3 of us came to about $35, including a beer.
Really appreciated the welcoming atmosphere and the fact that the the music was kept at a low volume!<//Review>< time>

(Translated by Google) While I was searching for hot noodles, I visited Old Siam, a Thai restaurant near to the hotel.
41.BBQ pork with egg noodle with Wanton
I ordered it, but the first impression that seems poor compared to the size of the bowl. Poetic noodle was eaten in Korea.
The bottom line was that the broth was deep and the bok choy looked like vegetables, meat, and dumplings were so delicious and the noodles didn't seem to be loose, but it was thin so it seemed to cut the broth well.
It didn't look very clean because of the interior, but it was a good place to come by and it's a good place to visit.

따뜻한 국수 먹고싶어서 검색하던 중에 숙소에서 가깝고 가격도 저렴한 타이 음식점 Old Siam 방문
41. BBQ pork with egg noodle with Wanton
주문했는데 그릇 크기에 비해 부실해보이는 첫 인상으로 시적한 누들은 한국에서 먹던 ... 무슨맛이지 ㅋㅋ 약간 라멘 맛과 비슷한데 요리명 기억이 안나네요
결론은 국물도 깊고 청경채같이 보이는 야채도, 고기도, 만두도 너무 맛있었고 면이 잘 안풀어진 것 같았지만 얇아서 육수도 잘 베어있던 것 같고 나름 탄력도 있어서 식감도 좋았습니다
인테리어 때문인지 아주 청결해보이는 느낌은 아니었지만 우연히 들린, 추천할만한 맛집이었고 다음 샌프란 방문때도 꼭 들르도록 해야겠습니다 ㅎㅎ< /Text>

Hesitated, but please eat.
It's not salty, you can eat the fried rice noodles that you eat in hot Korea.
It is soaked in hot broth.
The price is also affordable.

(Translated by Google) I loved eating at this place. You feel the real Thai flavor. The waiters are super attentive and with that typical Thai sweetness. And the food, wow! I felt like having returned !!! They even had Chang beer !!! My favorite is the green curry and I had to order it here. He had no loss, it was spectacular! When I said goodbye, I gave them a ขอบคุณ มาก (thank you very much) and they all smiled happy and grateful. 🙏🏼

<review>(Translated by Google) Nice food, some of it very fishy - check out the dishes before.
The staff are courteous, although having difficulty with the language sometimes they really tried to help
The restaurant closes very early!
There is an option for all kinds of vegetarian dishes which is nice!
Authentic store
Will happen like the rest of San Francisco ...
Short option nice

אוכל נחמד, חלק בעל טעם מאוד דגי - בידקו את המנות לפני.

חנות אותנטית
יקרה כמו שאר סן פרנסיסקו...

(Translated by Google) Incredibly good Thai cuisine at a very fair price. The food is really unique and cannot be topped. However, the service is underground - especially by American standards !! So if you can be lenient and love exquisite Thai food, you are in good hands here!

(Original)
Unglaublich gute thailändische Küche zu sehr fairem Preis. Das Essen ist wirklich einmalig und nicht zu toppen. Allerdings ist der Service unterirdisch – insbesondere für amerikanische Verhältnisse!!

(Translated by Google) If you're tired of the high price and salty foods you want to spit out, and you're tired of the bitter San Francisco wind, you can soothe your soul with hot broth and the perfect Thai food for your mouth. You can fill your stomach satisfactorily and melt your frozen body. $ 25 with two main foods is enough. I recommend it.

(Translated by Google) Really, believe me, I have to try this in San Francisco. It’s not too far from Union Square. It tastes so good that I have to relish this Thai food every time I travel more than a week. The Tom Yum Kung soup is really better than that. Anyone I have eaten should be delicious, pineapple and shrimp fried rice is also delicious, not to mention the thai iced tea!

(Original)
真的，相信我，去旧金山一定要尝尝这家，离着联合广场不太远，味道太赞了，以至于我后面一周多的旅行每次都回味这顿泰国菜，冬阴功汤真心比我吃过的任何一家都要好喝，菠萝虾仁炒饭也好吃，thai iced tea就更不用说啦！<//text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The place doesn't say much. But the dishes are authentic and delicious, and the attention of the staff is more than effective and very pleasant. The place is very clean, including the toilet. I have visited it on many occasions and I have tasted almost the entire menu and knowing Thai food very well, I can say that the flavors are exceptional and the dishes are large. Always satisfied. It is also steps from the cable car terminal, the Nordstrom / Bloomingdale shopping center, Macy's and Union Square. What more could you want ? Oh, don't forget the dessert, MANGO WITH STICKY RICE. !!!

Ademas esta a pasos de la terminal del cable car, del centro de compras Nordstrom/Bloomingdale, Macy's y Union Square. Que mas se puede pedir ?
