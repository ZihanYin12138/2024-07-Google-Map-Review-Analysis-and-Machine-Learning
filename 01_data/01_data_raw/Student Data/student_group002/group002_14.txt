Good price for several hours of family entertainment.  Doesn't offer as much as water works park, however a nice way to spend the afternoon on a hot summer day.

Biggest negative is they need to clean their bathrooms more often.  They get very dirty.</review>

< Review>
We went on Labor Day and I can honestly say it was a most pleasant experience! Wasn't crowded at all. Life guards were attentive but without the usual constant whistle blowing and yelling. I witnessed one guard gently pulling a kid aside to talk to him about not running. They also allow you to do trick jumps off the high dive.
The restrooms were tidy and the grounds beautiful. Love love live this place and for $4 for an adult, $3 for a child...can't beat the heat for less!
Great time had by all!<//Review>

Fun and entertaining.  We went today and it had rained.  Was fun to swim while it sprinkled, but turned to a storm and we left. Quite fun.  Food's good but a tad overpriced. 😄< /review>

The swimming accommodations are excellent there. With about 5-6 swimming areas in several pools, there’s something for everyone... from water slides, diving boards and a special kids swim area with water play structure. The facilities are clean and there are plenty of lifeguards on duty at all times. There is a fee for entry into the facilities, but getting a season pass or family pass can save you a bundle... and the price is reasonable! Highly recommended for families.< /review>

Nice place to take the kids for some fun. Inexpensive, easily accessible, and pleasant. The only thing I'd wish for is it would be nice to have some more covered spots. There's only one umbrella to keep the sun off people, everywhere else is blasted by the sun.<//Review>

The Redding aquatic center is the last expensive local place where you can have a good swim and enjoy a tube water slide.  They have a sizeable kiddie pool, half Olympic size pool and the usual low and high diving boards.  Thumbs up for an affordable way to stay cool!< /Text>

<review>Honestly the Redding Aquatic Center is okay and their pricing is fair, but some things have happened there with family friends that I think could have been prevented if it was watched more. They have decent services in the food quality, and some of the lifeguards are pretty nice, but the other half of the lifeguards are really rude and need to be a lot nicer to the younger ones. I understand that the younger ones may and always will get on our nerves, but come on don't feed fire with fire and take it down with a grain of salt because trust me sometime will come in their life when they have kids and they won't know how to do it right. I hope this review will help all of the lifeguards at The Aquatic Center get to be slightly nicer.< /review><GmapID>0x54d2ed3de4df4a1b:0xd978f450fd4b062< /GmapID><rate>3< /rate><date>1459007071979<//date><userid>108692856904259262365</userid>< Name>

Just had a big splash party for my daughter. It was awesome.  All my needs were met allowed us to do a piñata and the staff was super attentive. I would definitely recommend this wonderful place to have a party or just go to enjoy the pools.< /text>

<Text>I love taking my kids to the aquatic center no matter how old they are they all love the slide and obstacle course they have here.  It's a great way to spend the hottest part of your day so I recommend everyone get out of the house and enjoy a cheap and easy way to cool down this summer< /Text><user>117871479438902041569<//user>< resp>

Swim lessons done right! I think the time spent on behalf of my grandchildren has been life changing and potentially life saving and has been a pleasure.Thank you Redding Aquatic Center you are a class act, and so appreciated!</Text>

Not very fun for a group of children looking forward to the promise of a backpack. After arriving at the advertised time, waiting in the hot sun for 1 and a half hours,  just to be told "the backpack give away  will follow the event". We were not the only ones to leave. Bad form Bethel.< /review>

Family Fun for all ages.  If you like it it's worth getting the family pack for the season.  Pays for itself in a few visits.< /Review>

<Text>I loved it but I have a complain about the water slide while I was on the water slide a employee told me to get off the slide they said I'm to fat and chubby I got offended because I actually am fat But before that I been going on that slide for a couple hours before she said that so I ordered a snow cone it made me feel better (update: I lost weight and look better since 2 years ago I forgot I even made this review till now I'm at a healthy weight now I used to be overweight thank u)<//Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x54d2ed3de4df4a1b:0xd978f450fd4b062</gmapID></record>

<review>Great place to bring the family or just yourself! Enjoy the slide, the obstacle course, the kids playstructure, the variety of fitness classes or simply relax by the pool!

< review>
This place.... Came here for a xmas party. Needs to be renovated. Food was less than mediocre. We had mexican food...bleh. I am a fan of mexican food also I enjoy a little spice. But if you're catering to a group of diverse people of different backgrounds there should be multiple options and the food should not be spicy AF. Place was very dim so I cant judge ambiance of the hall (maybe a good thing) but by the looks of the outside you would think its abandoned. I would not hold a function here or even come to another function here.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Very bad service of everything that you promise and you pay nothing you meet the super dirty bathrooms the food they serve is very little they tell you what there is for 50 types of salads and they only put lettuce very bad room !!! Do not waste your time or your money here, look for better options

<Review>(Translated by Google) One of the worst places, starting with the security ones one of them has a big mouth and talks about the guests and the organizers of the party.
The kitchen is disgusting and servitude without education and without knowing how to treat people.
But the worst thing is that security, he has to learn to cut his mouth and dedicate himself to doing his job.

Uno de los peores lugares, empezando con los de seguridad uno de ellos tiene una gran boca y habla de los invitados y de los organizadores de la fiesta.
La cocina es un asco y la servidumbre sin educación y sin saber como tratar a las personas.
Pero lo peor es ese seguridad, el tiene que aprender a serrar la boca y dedicarse a hacer su trabajo.

(Translated by Google) Do not rent this room .. do not waste your money or time ... they want to abuse you they tell you one thing and do another even though this in the contract they delete it without telling you. Bad service .. super disgusting bathrooms .. the room was for 2am they closed the bar at 12:30 and we could not get our drink k we are supposed to drink until 2am. The tender bar took my liquor and I bought it. More people arrived than expected and they were not allowed in and it was fine but they told me that I had to pay to bring more service and security and I never came again. Auguen paid more .. the food was very good but I asked for pasta with shrimp and I had no shrimp .. the limo was not the one we asked for they want to give you what they want .. do a favor and go elsewhere, don't spend your money

(Translated by Google) Ricky thank you very much for all the truth that I do not have how to thank you for all the attention the facilities and to all your team from the waiters the security the bartender, the photographer your wife and of course your my dear friend. The place was beautiful better than I imagined, the exquisite food, the delicious cake and the drinks, not to mention, great music. You have an excellent service but above all you like to please people who place their trust in you and do not disappoint you, you take care of every detail and always with a smile that God bless you for the reception and all the attention we receive, my family and all my guests. My daughter's fifteen years were unforgettable.

Ricky muchísimas gracias por todo la verdad que no tengo como agradecerte todas las atenciones las facilidades y a todo tu equipo de trabajo desde los meseros la seguridad el  bartender, el fotógrafo tu esposa y por supuesto tu mi querido amigo. El lugar quedó hermoso mejor de lo que yo me imaginaba, la comida exquisita, el pastel delicioso y las bebidas pues  ni de que hablar, la música fenomenal. Tienes un servicio excelente pero sobre todo te gusta agradar a la gente que pone su confianza en ti y no la defraudas, cuidas cada detalle y siempre con una sonrisa que Dios te bendiga por el recibimiento y todas las atenciones que recibimos, my familia y todos mis invitados. Los quince años de mi hija fueron inolvidables.</Review>

(Translated by Google) the worst place to have an event they treat you well while you are paying but on the day of the event they change everything a very dirty place with cockroaches they promise you things that in the end do not meet inexperienced staff on the day of my event the temperature was 104 degrees and They did not want to put the air conditioning they changed the menu a place that I would not recommend to anyone.

(Original)
el   peor lugar para tener un evento te tartan bien mientras estas pagando pero el dia del evento te cambian todo un lugar muy sucio con cucarachas te prometen cosas que al final no cumplen personal sin experiencia el dia de mi evento la temperature estaba a 104 grados y no querian poner el aire acondicionado te cambian el menu un lugar que no recomendaria a nadien.< /Review>

Very good food and service. Prior review indicated no Italian wine so we brought one with us. Pleasantly surprised to find Italian wines on the list! Had a very pleasant Barbaresco. It was unfortunately served at room temperature rather than cellar temp.< /Review>

Great hole in the wall Italian restaurant. Patio seating is limited so call for reservations so you don't miss out.< /review>

Everything was wonderful!
Just driving through town and the resort told us their restaurant was closed. So we found this place. We ordered the chicken Marsala and a side of pasta. It was the perfect meal to the end of the day.<//Review>

Very  friendly service, delicious food.  Even our children asked for extra food to go. Their Tiramisu is my new standard for when I make my own.< /review>

<rating>3< /rating><Review>Very good food but ..... waited over an hour for dinner to arrive. Nothing is worth that kind of delay when they’re not that busy. My wife and split an entree. When the bill was presented it included a $7 charge which was not disclosed. The owner showed up when I complained and was especially confrontative, rude and inappropriate. Despite the good quality of the food, I will never return.</Review>< GmapID>

<Resp>{'time': 1593301674727, 'text': 'For showing the menu with the splitting charge  I was confrontative?  I took the splitting charge off the account to please you. In the restaurant cameras are working I took a look on how it was possible that you have waited  for "more than an hour" for your food. Here is what I have found: You have arrived to the restaurant 7:55pm. You were seated,  presented the menu, water, oil-vinegar, bread was served. Waiter arrived: 8:01. Wine was served 8:09, You got your appetizer 8:27. You had a “HEAVY DISCUSION WITH LOTS OF GESTICULATION“ with your wife (quarreling?). You finished your appetizer 8:39. The split scaloppini Marsala was served 8:41. Your wife left the restaurant  before you, so sorry your review is FAKE and  maybe meant for your wife.'}</Resp><Name>Mike K<//Name>< UserId.>

<Text>Bella Vita is a lovely and very romantic place to dine. I enjoyed the select menu of fine Italian foods prepared with old world style and flavors. Offers a full bar with great selection of wine and mixed drinks. The service was terrific! A Gem. I will be going to Bella Vita again.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Nice cozy Italian restaurant with a nice patio to eat al fresco. We had the lobster ravioli and the fettuccine zingara. Both delicious. I would highly recommend the fettuccine zingara made with chicken breast ,sausage and bell peppers among other things. Also we had great service.< /text>< pics>

They were able to fit us in tonight at the last minute. We actually had a marvelous time! The food was lovely, the service was great & our experience could not have been nicer. It was a random stop by — we had actually been headed somewhere else. I’m so glad my girlfriend remembered eating here a few years ago and told me to stop as we were passing by. I had the Cannelloni and it was delicious!< /Review>

Ordered 5 take out meals. When picking them up (in the back kitchen) I questioned 3 of the meals, as it wasn't what I ordered. A male with an Italian accent became extremely rude, insisting it was my screw up (his words). I had 3 people in the room who heard me place my order, and confirmed it. I cant believe you can be so rude to customers and stay in business.< /Review>

<Review>First time at Bella Vita. Food was outstanding. Fettuccine Zingara was amazing. Service from Enrique was personal and attentive. Wine list is ok, not great, no Italian wines. However they allow you to bring one in for a corking fee, which is appreciated. We will be back.< /Review><name>James ayres<//name>< Response>

<review>The food(garlic bread, appetizers and entrees)had no taste making us wonder if the cook has gustatory bud. We all had to add salt in all our dishes  The pasta price was reasonable but everything else was all over priced. Garlic bread $8, soda(including soda water!) was almost $6. We were surprised when we got our check because it was came out almost double than what we expected.< /review>< pics>

Had dinner here on Valentine’s Day. The staff was very nice and we were given a rose on our way out. That was a sweet gesture. Unfortunately the food was not so good. We started with an order of fried artichoke hearts. The batter was crispy but had no flavor.  The artichoke hearts were either out of a can or jar because they were very soft. For $16 (7 half hearts, not whole) I would expect fresh. So that was disappointing. We then ordered the Orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe as well as the eggplant parm. The pasta was not orecchiette but instead was shells. A little disappointing. But more disappointing was that the pasta was overcooked and the only flavor was the overpowering flavor of garlic, and I like garlic. The eggplant parm was okay but was swimming in sauce. We will not be returning to this restaurant.<//text>

My wife & I came for a late lunch/early dinner and had a wonderful meal & experience!  We were greeted nicely, advised fresh bread was just coming out of the oven, & were seated immediately.  Fresh bread w/ olive oil & balsamic was served as our drinks arrived, and we each ordered a lunch special (lasagna, and linguine w/clams).  They were both Excellent!  A wonderful restaurant...we'll be back!</review>

<text>We had a very unpleasant experience at this establishment. Our waiter was roughly in his fifties and had black hair. He had a demeaning attitude and was very rude. We attempted to ask him about the ingredients in a few of the items because they were not listed on the list because one of us was a vegetarian and everyone had their own food preferences, however, he himself did not know what was in many of the dishes and we just ended up ordering and hoping we wouldn’t get the ingredients we choose to avoid in our dishes. Unsurprisingly, my mother ended up getting pork in her dish which she does not eat and the waiter failed to mention. Overall, we ended up spending about 150 dollars among four of us for mediocre food. This place tries to come off as a high-end dining establishment with exquisite food, but that’s simply not the case and it’s atmosphere is very unwelcoming. I do not recommend this restaurant.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Quaint little Italian Restaurant in a strip mall atmosphere, located just outside the Marriott Desert Springs Resort. Prices here are less than in the resort or other restaurants near by. The food was delicious, and served with a small plate of bread, witch olive oil and vinegar. My wife got the capalini lilo dish, and wasn’t fond of the capers, I thought they were delish. The portion size appeared a bit small though for her dish. I got the Eggplant Parmesan and it was served backed in a lasagna dish, lightly breaded with a fresh homemade marinara sauce, caked in cheese and freshly grated Parmesan offered by our server. You also must try the fried artichoke hearts, they are to die for (it’s the marinara sauce the makes the dish).<//Review>

Delicious food - I had the Ossa Bucco and it was so savory.  The meat was tender, the pasta served with it was cooked just right and vegetables crisp.  Service was good although staff was very busy.  Brought home a doggie bag bc portions are big.  I would return and recommend to others.<//Text>

My grandparents were born in Italy and half of my family still resides there.  This was a massive disappointment.  The dish I ordered, the Orecchiette, is a family staple.  I was served flavorless mush.  The pasta was overcooked, the sausage was mushy and there was no flavor or spice.  First time in years that I haven't finished a plate.  I picked out the greens because the rest was inedible.  On top of it the waiter dumped parmesan on my lap.< /Review>

Stopped in for a quick lunch, and we enjoyed so much more!   All hand made fresh pasta, cooked just like when we were in Italy! Had gnocchi with pesto paired with a great Chianti.  She enjoyed orecchiette and a Pinot grigio.  We started with a beautiful and fresh caprese salad. Don't be disauded by the strip mall frontage. All dishes were prepared perfectly.  Service was outstanding!< /review>

We had Osso Bucco and a mussel and clam linguini dish for lunch. The food was delicious--we were especially impressed with the seafood. We had wine by the glass, so we weren't able to check out the full list. We'd like to go again.</text>

I've had the pleasure of working with Custom Fit and some of their trainers, not as a client, but as a videographer and photographer for their training and nutrition programs. Not only is their facility a bright, beautiful space to work in, CF has also shown a dedication to cleanliness and the safety of all who enter throughout the pandemic, which I was able to witness firsthand. The staff are knowledgeable, motivational, and fun people to be around and I would definitely recommend CF as a place to work out if you live or work in the area.< /review>

It appears we’ve never met nor have you been a client of our studio so it’s unfortunate we have to connect for the first time under these circumstances. As a local, family-run business we take our reputation very seriously and after being closed for over a year due to COVID, and only recently reopening at a limited capacity, it’s very disheartening to read your review of our personal training and nutrition studio.\n\nWe strive to be the best neighbors possible and have completed some acoustic testing to mitigate any vibrations or noise emanating from our studio. We do not intentionally drop weights (no olympic lifting) and do not do any exercises or play music that produce vibrations. Clients do accidentally drop weights from time to time so this could be the case here but without any context (time of day, what you heard, etc) of your review, it’s impossible to determine if this was caused by us. Being centrally located on Market St also means there are various noises and vibrations such as construction, sirens, cable cars, street people, etc. that could be the source of the disturbance.  However, if we did disturb you, I truly apologize, and I want to do everything I can to prevent it from happening again so please reach out at your earliest convenience so we can communicate in-person and solve this.\n\nI hope you have a happy and healthy 2021.\n\nThank you.'}< /response>< review>
This studio makes so much noise when they slam weights down. Shakes the whole building. Selfish people only think about their own needs.<//review>

It has been such a pleasure to work with Evan at Custom Fit! First of all the facility is gorgeous, and very well-equipped. I love the clean, modern, and alive vibes of the space, with lots of plants, and earthy design accents like bamboo floors and astroturf. Makes working out more pleasant for me when I’m doing it in a beautiful (and spotless!) space.

Evan is also incredibly professional and really knows his stuff in terms of how to address each individual’s body differently. Custom Fit is a perfect name since I really feel like he customizes an exercise plan unique to me. We spent the entire first session just assessing my movement habits and figuring out where I needed work. He identified several asymmetries right away and gave me exercises and stretches that helped SO much! I also really appreciate the added nutrition piece that he and his colleagues offer. As a fellow healthcare professional, I know first-hand how crucial proper nutrition is, and agree that true fitness is far more than just working out.

If you’re looking for help with your fitness, give Evan a call! Highly recommended!< /Review>

Custom fit has changed my life and my body! Eric is genuinely concerned about my fitness goals and makes sure that every workout is different from the last. You are sure to get a great workout and feel a part of something bigger than yourself. I am grateful for Eric's focus on what my needs are and sets up the next workout to achieve my goals. You need to check this out!< /review>

I go to Custom Fit for both the "Personal Training" and the "Nutrition" and they both get a resounding 5 stars from me.

Nutrition:
I work with Tarah Venn, who is an incredibly thoughtful and adept nutritionist and has already helped me make more progress in the 2 months I've been working with her than I made in the last 2 years on my own. She promotes long-term habits as opposed to "quick tips" to reach goals quickly. If you're interested in getting some help to reach your dietary goals, I couldn't recommend her more highly.

Personal Training:
I work with Kendra Africa, who has been a perfect match for me in terms of personal training. She's customized all of my workouts to optimize strengthening muscles where I've long had weaknesses. I also have dealt with multiple knee injuries and Kendra has been so helpful finding ways to prevent future injuries. She clearly has a vested interest in my success and that's really awesome.<//review>

<Gmap_id>0x808580a0194d2cb5:0xfb26f15dc1e052b7</Gmap_id><Text>I’ve worked with personal trainer Charles Armstrong for over 3 years now and it has been one of the best decisions I've made about my personal health and well-being.

His great skills in personal training honed with years of experience and education make for great workout sessions. Charles pushes me to constantly challenge myself and I have definitely seen results in my physical (and mental!) health.

A trainer and client have to be a good fit. One of the main reasons Charles and work well together is that I trust him. He is an all-around great person to be around. He is always positive, personable and reliable.

I've gone from never working out (before I worked with Charles) to now working out 2 to 3 times a week with him. I can be very unmotivated to work-out, but he constantly changes-up my routine so that I don't get bored and stay motivated. He constantly watches my form and reminds me of any corrections I need to make.

I also really enjoy training at Custom Fit - the people are friendly and the space works well for individual training sessions. The location works well for me too< /Text><Name>J< /Name><date>1583195806433</date><rate>5<//rate></record>

<review>Really great facilities & trainers. Katie is amazing. She is knowledgeable, non-judgemental, and motivating. She is there for you outside of sessions and does her best to change the way you think about fitness. When I started with Katie, all i cared about was what I saw on the scale. I rarely did any strength training and spent the last couple of years in grad school without even stepping foot in a gym. With her help & coaching, I feel myself improving with every workout and learning to love my body and its abilities more. Highly recommend.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I have been training with Evan since 2015 at another studio prior to Custom Fit.  When Evan opened Custom Fit, I followed him.  Why?  As a plus size woman,  being comfortable with my trainer is important to me.  Evan is non-judgemental, easy-going and keeps me motivated by making each training session unique so it is never dull.  He is challenging but never to the point where I feel discourage and overwhelmed.  I often joke with him and tell him "I am playing ball with the big boys now" bring it on!  because he makes me feel like I am capable of doing anything and that is very important because it keeps me going!!  I train now once a week with Evan and twice with Allen-another extraordinary motivator!  I was reluctant to train with Allen because I was so use to training with Evan three times a week but Allen has completely won me over!  Allen's dedication to my success has helped me stay focus.  He is driven, passionate and does not deviate- it is all about staying focus, having control and breathing properly.  When he talks about his own personal workouts and how great he feels, he lights up! and as a result it motivates me to continue pushing myself even harder.  Now that is what training is all about!  Having the desire to take it to the next level!!! Having both Evan and Allen as my personal trainers,  I know that 2020 is the year that I will make drastic changes for a better and healthier self.<//text>

Katie is a great trainer who always comes prepared with a plan to kick my butt.  I trained with her at a previous gym before she moved to Custom Fit and I followed here.  Couldn't be happier with the new place - lots of room, good equipment and the staff is friendly.  Highly recommended</Review>

< Review>
I train at Custom Fit with Katie Kroshka and I absolutely love it. Even when she's pushing me, muscles burning, lungs yelling at me and I feel like I can't do another more rep, I'm still having a blast. And with a smile from Katie and encouragement I'm able to finish the set. She literally lights up like a Christmas tree when she's proud and you've done well. She takes pride in her work and truly loves what she does. I think there needs to be a good balance between serious focus and having fun. Katie has found this balance and shares it with me and I can't thank her enough. Her knowledge is deep and sometimes, I don't even notice we've had a session until the next day. She makes it easy and challenging at the same time. Wizardry.

The gym itself is clean, comfortable, and has all the tools we need for whatever we're focusing on that day. The other trainers are respectful and kind and you don't even notice anyone else in the building. Everyone is focused on what they're doing and I like that. I'm a fan of privacy, especially when it comes to self improvement. So feeling comfortable in this professional space is a determining factor in me coming back to Custom Fit time and time again. If the gym seems like a scary place to you, or you're a seasoned fitness pro, Katie and Custom Fit will help you ease those fears or meet those goals. Thank you!<//Review>

I signed up to Custom Fit 4 months ago as a first-timer to Personal Training, I am absolutely delighted with the experience and the results. Evan conducted an initial consultation and assigned me to Jackie - a calm, patient and good-humored trainer. Each session was unique and challenging. Never boring. The gyms are spotless and the equipment well maintained. In parallel I consulted with nutritionist - Marissa, who offered pragmatic tips on dietary improvements without compromising on quantity, flavor or convenience. Highly recommended.</Text>

<time>1567528772489<//time><rate>5<//rate><text>Awesome experience working with Evan & team at Custom Fit SF for partner training.  The gym is conveniently located, clean, well-organized and super functional for strength and circuit workouts.  Lots of fun equipment to mix up workouts (sled, battle ropes, kettlebells, etc.) and for recovery (massage guns, foam rollers, etc.).  The vibe is friendly and unpretentious and even at peak hours the gym is never over-crowded.  Our trainer, Lucia, was extremely professional, easy to communicate with, and planned fun, challenging workouts.  The included nutritional advice and recipes was also a huge additional value!  Highly recommended, would gladly train here again in the future.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<review>I've had the most amazing experience with Custom Fit. I can't recommend this studio enough!! The owner, Evan, met with me for an  introductory meeting and helped me get started on my fitness and wellness journey. During our initial meeting he asked great questions, was very encouraging, and made excellent recommendations. He also sent me recipes and nutrition info and tips after we met. Evan matched me with Lucia as my personal trainer. Training with Lucia has been truly life changing. Lucia is so skilled, attuned, and supportive. I feel challenged during each of our sessions and I look forward to coming to the studio each time. It's the best part of my week.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Name>

The gym is nice and clean and the equipment is very professional. The only complaint is that there's only one shower room which is always busy. But if you can go to a shower room at home or work that should be fine< /Review>

Initially drawn to Custom Fit because it's so close to home and convenient. Keep coming back because the workouts are awesome - dynamic, never boring or repetitive, and challenging (thanks, Jackie!). Definitely workout harder than if I were to do it on my own. Added bonus: large, clean space. Never crowded. Great package deals.</review>

I decided to go into Custom Fit on a whim about 3-4 months prior to my wedding. I wanted to get into shape before the big day and knew I needed help doing it. From the get-go, Evan took the time to understand my goals and assess the shape I was in. He is professional and articulate which makes it easy to understand the various routines sets out for you.

I was assigned to Scott as my trainer in the beginning; however, due to my schedule with work Evan moved me over to Keith after a few sessions. Both Scott and Keith were great! Energetic and encouraging. Keith took the time to get to know me and clearly outlined the various exercises each and every session. He also kept it ever-changing, working different muscle groups while maintaining a focus on my core as that is what I wanted to see changed for my wedding.

My husband said I looked amazing and I felt great! I attribute Custom Fit to this and the amazing operation they have. It's a beautiful, clean gym with a variety of equipment. I highly recommend! Only thing to note, keep in mind it's a tad expensive--but most personal trainers are.<//Text>

<Text>This review is long overdue. I have been working out with the team at custom fit for about a year now, and like all the other reviews on here could not be more happy with it. Worked with a variety of trainers any would be a great choice.
Space is very well kept up, AC so its never to hot and very clean. I have now long considered this a must when looking over a budget, I would do yourself and your body the favor of trying it out.< /Text>< Pics>

I’ve had a great experience at Custom Fit. I’m an older guy, hadn’t worked out in several years, and was hesitant to go to a typical gym. Then I heard about Custom Fit. Evan, the owner, matched me with a talented trainer, Dennis, who knows a ton about diet, exercise and physiology in general. Dennis eased me into a routine, always being sensitive of my limits and injuries. (I hurt my lower back running a 10k a few months back.) To make a long story short, over the course of six months, I’ve lost 25 pounds and three pants sizes. My mood and self-confidence have soared. And it’s all thanks to Custom Fit.<//Review>

Working out at Custom Fit has been such a great experience! I've been working out with Scott for over a year now and before I started training with him, I maybe went to the gym a few times a month and ate poorly. In addition to having amazing workout sessions with Scott (and a few times with Evan), they've given me advice about nutrition which has really helped, and I'm now in the best shape of my life. Would totally recommend Custom Fit to anyone looking for a trainer!<//Text>

<Review>I don't think of myself as a person who would join a gym but at 67 I wanted to get in shape and trade-in some fat for muscle. I wanted to change my diet as well. You can find all of these services at Custom Fit. In just a short amount of time I have lost about 25lbs. and I always walk out of the place feeling stronger and having more energy then when I walked in.  Scott is  also working with me to strengthen muscle around some old injuries so I won't need surgery and it's working.  Scott is a great personal trainer who listen to my needs and customizes routines which I can work on both at the studio and at home. All of the trainer seem to support one another so the customer feels both the personal touch and a team support to each person they work with.<//Review>< Pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I've never been to a gym like this one, I actually didn't even know they existed before. I usually walk by on my way to work and noticed how cool it looked so after checking out the website I decided to give personal training a try. I initially met with Evan for the first session and decided to give a two trainers a try, one each per week. This is great for me as they both are very knowledgable and I have more scheduling flexibility (I travel to the south a lot). It's been a few months now and I'm making great progresses for a 60 yr old and doing things I never though possible. I'm now even considering meeting with their nutritionist to help with my diet. Would recommend 100% for anyone looking to improve their fitness in a professional atmosphere.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>I do really enjoy working out at this gym. Even when it is busy with people working on their fitness, it is never crowded and never feel judged. They have personal training and nutrition advice that you can get, so it is one of the best ways for me to address some of the gaps in my knowledge. More than anything, having someone help you with accountability is huge.<//text><Response>None< /Response></record>

This review is about Nutrition planning with Marissa at Custom Fit. She had a thorough screen of my diet and provided helpful meal planning that was manageable on several fronts: the recipes were quick, simple and delicious. I also like that ingredients crossed over from one recipe to another so there was virtually no waste. I really liked the make-ahead meals with variations that meant I had snacks and/or breakfast on the go. I hate throwing food away and feel guilty when I buy an ingredient I am unlikely to use again that goes to waste so this aligned really well with Marissa's suggested recipes.</text>

If you’re looking for a great personal trainer or nutritionist this is the place to go. I’ve worked with two trainers here so far and now I’ve decided to take it to the next level with my nutrition and about a month ago signed up with Marissa. The training + the recipes and meal ideas are fantastic and I feel great. They are customized to fit your cooking skillz, tastes and anything else you want (protein, veggies, etc.) Would definitely recommend Custom Fit if you’re looking for a super clean fitness space, a team (or just one…) of great personal trainers to get you in shape or a nutritionist to help with your diet!!< /Review>

I have been training with Jackie at CustomFit for 5 months now and absolutely love everything about my experience. The gym is always clean and never too crowded. I started going to CustomFit to help with my running and by working with Jackie my training and race times are improving. I'm not always the easiest person to work with but Jackie has been nothing but patient and always has the best attitude. Walk away from every session with a smile (and better abs).< /review>

I started working out with Milad to get ready for my wedding, but I was so happy with my results that I kept going for another two months. Milad is a great trainer with a ton of experience, but he also makes the workouts fun and tailors them to your specific needs. No two sessions are ever the same, which keeps things interesting. If you're in pain or uncomfortable, Milad knows exactly the right stretch or modification to help. I could not recommend a better trainer!

Additionally, Custom Fit is a great gym. The facilities are clean and spacious, and the equipment is state of the art. Everyone here is friendly and focused on their own goals which makes this a comfortable and supportive environment to sweat in.</text>< user>

Beautiful space. Top notch amenities. This is the place to work out if you're after results in personal training. Evan assessed my posture and movement and designed stretching and strengthening exercise program to address my goals and challenges. I do Pilates and Redcord suspension exercises three times a week and was looking for something to compliment my routine. I highly recommend both Evan and Custom Fit.< /Text>

I started working out at Custom Fit in preparation for my wedding , and I am SO HAPPY that I did! The studio is beautiful, clean, and has something for everyone/every level of fitness. I am an ER doctor with a crazy schedule and they were extremely accomodating.

I trained with Milad who is awesome :) He is extremely knowledgeable in anatomy and mobility ,and he uses evidence based practices to help his clients achieve their goals.  I was about a year out from rotator cuff surgery, and Milad customized our sessions to ensure that I got the results I wanted without re-injuring myself.

If you are looking for a great personal training experience do yourself a favor and check out Custom fit!<//Text>

I found this place while Googling local nutritionists and decided to give Marissa and Brooke a try. I really enjoyed working with both of them, and I even decided to try personal training to be as healthy as I can. I got great recipes to cook at home and workouts to do as well. It was just the jumpstart I neeeded to become healthy and fit.< /Text>

<pics>None</pics><Text>I've now been working out with Scott once a week for the past several months (previous trainer Summer moved away – I've been working out at Custom Fit for over a year). Scott is awesome to train with, and I wake up on Monday mornings pumped to start my week with a fun, challenging, exhausting but energizing workout. Every single workout is different and new, but for me they always includes cardio, strength training, core workouts (killer), balance, and boxing (my favorite!! - Scott trained as a boxer for years so he's ridic and even though he's clearly going easy on me, it doesn't *feel* like he is, haha).

The new thing I've noticed, too, is that trying new routines with Scott makes me want to keep it up and try things at my regular gym the rest of the week. The other trainers and clients are awesome at coordinating space with each other, it never feels crowded, is always bright and sunny, and clients are all ages and shapes and fitness levels which I absolutely love because the gym feels inclusive but everyone is motivated and training hard. If I could budget to start every morning working out with Scott at Custom Fit, I totally would!</Text><UserId.>114153562451692012614</UserId.>< Rating>

<resp>None< /resp><text>Let me start off by telling you how NICE this studio is. Beautiful, bright, airy, clean, sleek, simple, welcoming, and fully-equipped. I've been lifting weights, taking classes, and playing sports (including high-level and very competitive) for much of my life, and Custom Fit stands out and stands apart from the many, many places I've exercised. It's a place that makes you want to work hard and do a few extra reps, just because it's such a great environment.

From the moment you walk in the door, Evan and Marissa and their staff are friendly, genuine, low-key, extremely knowledgable, and highly professional. Don't let the laid back demeanor fool you, though; These are people who are serious in their quest to provide the full, personalized health experience for the widest possible range of people. Whether you're training for something specific, or re-evaluating your exercise routine, or just needing a little help, or changing your whole life around, this is the place.

It is immediately evident that the trainers are extremely knowledgeable about fitness, nutrition (especially Marissa, what a gem), and general healthy lifestyle choices. They work together with each client (and with each other) to create a personalized, informative, understandable, and achievable set of goals, and then commit themselves to helping each person achieve them. I can't say enough good about the stuff here. They're the best I've found, hands down.

I also love that the studio is really clean (the complete opposite of those grungy training studios and gyms that are supposed to be "authentic," but are actually just gross). Floors, ceilings, and everything in between is state of the art, functions perfectly, and is extremely well-maintained. The bathroom and shower are excellent. The equipment includes some things you're probably familiar with, and some things you probably aren't; the trainers here are experts in using it all in creative ways to help each person make the most of their training experience.

Lastly, just some little things that especially stand out: they'll wash your gym clothes for you! No more sweaty clothes sitting in your car while you're at work all day. So underrated, and a great perk. Also, great music on a real stereo system! None of the standard box-gym garbage played on tinny little speakers. As you can tell, I'm a big fan of SF's newest (and by far nicest) personal training studio. It's the total package, and more. If I could give it 6 stars, I would!<//text><rating>5< /rating>< Pictures>

<review>You can find all sorts of things; household cleaners, house interior exterior paint that people brought there instead of in land fills; for $0.  They do a fantastic job & do Kern county a huge service. Facility always clean & people always friendly.  Before throwing those aerosol cans or nasty chemicals in trash put them in a box take them there. Been going there for many years.<//review>< Name>

This place is amazing for those who're environmentally responsible. They accept hazardous waste like electronics, chemicals, expired medication, biohazard materials. If you use a sharps container for used diabetic supplies, they'll accept your sharps container and replace it free of charge (which I've been told is a rarity as most other places will charge you a disposal fee). The process is very pain free, typically you drive up, hand over your undesirables, issue your John Hancock, and be on your merry way. No need to step out of your vehicle. The staff on hand are very friendly. You actually have no excuses not to use this place.</Review>

I've been coming here for years. People are helpful and nice. Thy will help with all you needs. Lines are getting longer. A lot more people are finding out about this place. I don't have a bad word about this place. Grate enviermenly for the world. And you can get paint to redo what ever you want at home. Win win all the way around.
Update.
The hours shown on this site are not right . Thay have changed the times an days that thay are open to the public.  The times shown here are from years ago. And a lot of the info here is no longer accurate.  Guess that dont have any one updating this site. But it's still a grate place. I'm just a as ying you.my want to call ahead and check Tim's and days of operation.</text>

<Name>Quincey Cecil<//Name><review>I am originally from Chicago, IL  just recently moved to the area. Had an display issue with my iPhone 6 Plus and took it to the Apple Store and the entire phone needed replaced. Bought a New iPhone 6 Plus from the Apple Store and brought it to the Boost Mobile Store in Corona to be activated. Jocelyn was very nice and patient and helped me get the phone switched from my old damaged phone SIM card to the new phone I purchased from the Apple Store.

Jocelyn was truly AMAZING. I believe I found a Boost Mobile Store Home that treated me just like a Store I frequented when I lived in Chicago.

Thank you Jocelyn. You are loved and appreciated Queen.</review><resp>None<//resp><rating>5</rating>< Pics>

I want to 1st start off by thanking Yajaira. She helped me out so much today. I called the store to ask questions in regards to purchasing another phone since I lost my phone the other night. She was so helpful very professional. She took the time to explain the different options I can take. I must have called her 5 to 6 times today and every time I called she was very helpful. I had great customer service thanks to Yajaira.< /Text>

Love these guys! Helped us get Chai and Ceylon (the kitties in the picture) fixed which was very much needed. I like them so much I set my amazon smile donations to go to them :D
I would absolutely suggest them to others!< /text>

We have had such a hard time finding cats to live on our property. I found this organization from a random google search and it has been the best discovery. They were so thorough in understanding our needs and hopes and also so helpful in setting us up for success with our barn cats. They delivered two barn cats and lent us an appropriate crate to keep them in initially. They were also very detailed and clear about what materials we needed to set up on our end. They continue to check in periodically and always offer to come out to the house to help, despite us living in a fairly rural area. I’m just so pleased with our experience all around.<//Review>

We loved the entire process of adopting our barn kitties. Our two little kitties were chosen to help us keep the rodent population down without harmful chemicals. We are so happy. The entire process was simple from the application to the delivery of the kitties, and the specific guidance in between. The entire team was very communicative and you can tell they love what they do! We are about three weeks in and are excited to soon let Basil and Hazel out of their crates to live a normal life again. Basil is getting restless and who can blame her? They are the cutest little girls. Thank you LYFF! It's nice to give these girls a second chance.< /text>

We found this organization simply by chance and we are so grateful we did. After contacting them, they made it so easy and quick to get our cat neutered. We truly appreciate the help in getting that done because had we not found this I honestly can’t say if we would of gotten it done. Love Your Feral Feline is a great organization! Would definitely recommend.</Review>

We had a very positive experience adopting our kitten. The whole process was smooth and seamless and they were available before and after our adoption to answer questions. Our kitten is the sweetest little guy and we couldn’t be happier!<//Review>

Couldn’t be happier with LYFF and the ladies who helped us out!!
We were new to town and our builder recommended them, filled out the application on line and they called me that night.
They really care about the cats that they place and walked me through every step of the process.
It’s been over 3 months and they still check in on us.
Over all a very pleasant experience!!</review>

<Name>Brenda Hansen<//Name><time>1622735970645</time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>If you are looking for a barn cat, or even a companion cat, I highly recommend LYFF.   We have adopted 4 cats over a course of a year from their barn cat program.  They delivered the cats to us, provided advice and after care (one of our cats had a runny nose and they provided antibiotics) and even provided a nice care package with the last two.

Some of the cats only spend a few days in the shelter, but one of them was about ready to be euthanized before he was brought to us.  This gives the cats a chance at the life they want to live--even though being outdoors is still a risk for them--that's where they came from originally without being spayed or neutered, or having a steady source of food and water.  Most of the cats warmed up to humans pretty quickly.  We even have one that hangs out with us all day and follows us around the ranch and sleeps on our front porch.

The interaction with the staff/volunteers at LYFF has been very positive and they really care about their cats.</text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dc77fc3123c3a1:0x4c69767941fcc0< /gmap_id></record>

I was struggling to get my Reeses spayed because i couldn't afford it. I even thought I'd have to give her up. Someone told me Feral Felines might be able to help, so i gave them a call.  They went above and beyond my expectations.  They did all they could to help me out. And then some.  My Reeses is now Spayed and even got some immunizations. They also gave her a huge bag of cat food.  They were all super friendly, professional, and understanding of my situation.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>The services this organization does for you are extraordinary. Super reliable, affordable and they really took care of my NOW fur babies. Trust the process and go through the application process. It’s definitely worth it ; my experience with them was very open and honest from the start and they were so nice to take us in. It took about 3-4weeks for post- surgery results and recovery. Luckily, it took the male kitten to recover a lot quicker than the female kitten due to the surgery incision. I went in with two kittens that my husband and I were fostering at the moment and didn’t know whether I wanted to keep due to expenses. I was talking to the non profit organization and they took care of everything I just paid a small fee for 2 kittens and gave them a date of availability. I was also responsible to bring in them in their own kennel and surgery cones. The vet they work with also do an amazing job of making sure you feel comfortable through the process.</review>< pics>

My family had a great experience with LYFF! I really like how they run their adoption process. You fill out an application and once it's approved you get to go meet the different cats at Cat and Craft. I really feel like this is the best option for families because if we would have picked the one we first saw it wouldn't have been a good fit for us. Having the option to see different cats and see how they react to you really is the best opportunity to find the right pet. I love how all of the donations goes towards their rescue. not only do you get a fun experience you also get a forever pet that is microchip spayed or neutered and vaccinated. Thank you so much we love our new cat!!!<//Review>

Wow if I could give them more then 5 stars I would. We thought we had to pay $25 for our cat to get neutered and we ended up not paying nothing because the donor paid it full. The person who was in contact with us was very nice and helpful. Our cat recovered quickly. We are Very thankful and blessed. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼💛💛💛 Thank you from the bottom of my heart ❤️ ❤️❤️❤️< /Text>

<username>Faith E< /username><Time>1621670095005< /Time><Rating>1<//Rating><review>We love fur babies and were referred to LYFF by a colleague as a great organization to adopt a kitten (or two!)

We had high hopes for adopting two seemingly bonded kitties but have been sorely disappointed by the adoption process, lack of consistent follow up and what feels like arbitrary application of implementation of unusual filtering.

For example, there is question about whether renter vs owner and if landlord approves you having pets. These are normal and customary questions. What is unusual is a seemingly rigid halt to application process to reach out to an applicant's landlord to gain 3rd party consent for having pets. As a quite seasoned and mature adult, it is unusual to have an organization seeking confirmation from a person's landlord where things like this are already stipulated, outlined, or addressed in one's lease. To me (though still invasive), a copy of lease would be better avenue as landlords aren't accustomed to 3rd parties contacting them about pet adoption for their tenants.

Nonetheless, it took two follow ups from me and a direct ask about the two kitties we were seeking to adopt before I received a reply stating that they were waiting for my landlord to reply to them and that the two kittens we'd applied for were adopted out to someone else. I understand understaffing and high volume as I work as a Manager for a major Branded hotel but to not proactively inform an applicant that the kittens they're applying for were being redirected felt like a slap and severely insensitive.

Since receiving the info that the two kittens we had applied for were adopted out to someone else, we've received zero feedback, follow up, or reply. Particularly during these times, I find it difficult to believe that our application was halted because of a landlord reply when there are many alternatives to confirming, proving pet allowance. No other cat adoption organization or humane society appears to function in this manner.

Perhaps this was a one off process for us which was quite unfortunate.

I love sharing great experiences and positive stories. This experience however has fallen harshly short in so many ways.

Hopefully others will have a better adoption journey with LYFF than we did.</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>Love Your Feral Felines is an amazing animal rescue to support if you are looking to adopt, volunteer or donate. They work very hard to help kittens and cats in the community both well and with compromised health. Their successful rescue stories are incredible! I had a great experience when adopting my first cat with LYFF, she already had all her vaccinations and was spayed. LYFF was also so kind to help me through their low cost spay & neuter clinic with my new kitten. It was also a great experience and very much appreciated. Such a relief to have their support. Always so nice and responsive. Thank you for all you do LYFF!!</Text>< pics>

I have terrible experience with them, since March I am applying to adopt a kitten and they kept rejecting me for no reason! I am really really hurt by this organization because they are the one who causes people " buy" pet instead of " adopting" them. After multiple emails, phone calls, application, texts, they got back to me after 10 days and saying we are not comfortable with your application and you cannot adopt!!!! My salary is high, I do have a 3 bedroom apartment and its me and my sister in an apartment, I really cannot understand why I have to suffer this much to adopt a cat!!? Why a very pleasant experience should be very hard and painful? Since March,2021 I am looking for a cat to adopt from their organization and today is May.9th! They really hurt my feeling, really, and finally I ended up " The cat lounge rescue in La jolla" and adopted a beautiful, healthy kitten! The process went really smooth and they really appreciate you by adopting a cat from there, and helping a community!< /text>

We have had the best experiences with Love Your Feral Felines! We adopted our cat from them 3 1/2 years ago. They were great to work with and very supportive. Our feral cat that we adopted from LYFF has turned into a house cat. We live on a canyon, and he can go in and out of our house as he pleases - though he prefers to stay inside 99% of the time. He gets along with our 2 Great Pyrenees. And he is street smart - we haven’t lost him in all of these years. Such a blessing. He completes our family. We are so thankful for Love Your Feral Felines for rescuing him and us! We highly recommend Love Your Feral Felines!</Text>

I had a really great experience with LYFF. The response time was good and everyone I dealt with was wonderful. I ended adopted a super sweet kitten after meeting her at Cat & Craft cafe. She was up to date on vaccines, spayed, and microchipped when I adopted her. All of the cats and kittens I met were super cool and would recommend anyone looking for a new feline friend to check out the cats that LYFF have.</review>

Such a great experience with LYFF! They were so helpful, friendly, & professional over texts & email getting my barn cats fixed. The female was pregnant already, and had SEVEN kittens, but I only found homes for five of them. LYFF was then helpful when I got those two fixed. Thank goodness, or else the kitten cycle would have started all over again, which isn't good for feral cats. I'm so thankful this organization exists, & I highly recommend them for your feral felines.<//review>

Me and my fiance adopted our kitten, Millie, from Love Your Feral Felines and we absolutely loved our experience, the kindness and easiness from the people, and the process of adoption was so easy and fast that made us so appreciative. We absolutely love our baby girl! She came fixed and with all her shots and they gave us lots of help in deciding who was best for us. I have been friends with one of the members Melissa for a while and reached out to her when we decided we wanted to adopt a kitten and she made the process and everything so easy and amazing for us. She knew exactly which one was going to be the best fit for us and she was right! Millie loves her spot in the window in our apartment and loves to play with us and cuddle. Melissa and the organization made the process so easy as it was very organized and easy to contact. We could really tell they love what they do and they love their kittens as it shows in their dedication and work. I am so grateful for our little baby girl and how perfect she is for our lifestyle and what we were looking for. We couldn't ask for a better organization or kitten. I truly can't say enough great things about them!<//Text></record>

WOW! LYFF is the best ever! It was our first time ever adopting cats and LYFF were so thoughtful and helpful throughout the entire process. We adopted two feral cats and LYFF came to our home and delivered our new fur babies and gave us so much helpful information about the best way to keep our cats safe and happy in their new home and yard. Our feral cats are now best friends and love it here.  LYFF is so compassionate and committed to giving cats the best life they can and I would recommend LYFF to anyone looking to adopt. A few months after adopting our outdoor feral babies we decided to adopt indoor cats and they helped us find a great place to get them neutered and spayed.< /Review>

Love your feral felines is one of the best cat rescues. They helped me personally to fix a cat & help him with a hernia surgery. They really care about the cats and helping them. If you’re looking to adopt please check them out.</Text>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>They might be a great adoption organization, but I never really found out. I applied, and heard nothing for a week. So my daughter and I went to Cat & Craft, played with some cats, contacted the staff there, and didn't hear anything about our application. 3 weeks later, I still haven't heard anything. I guess that's a passive aggressive way of denying an application, but I don't really know because they haven't responded.

So we went to the Cat Lounge in La Jolla. Applied, drove there the following day and went home with a kitten same day.

Will LYFF ever approve or deny our application? Don't know, don't care. Fortunately, because of the Cat Lounge, I'll never need to find out.<//Text>< username>

<Review>If I could give this organization 1 star I would. My experience with them was horrible for many reasons. I would make an appointment to see at cat at there petsmart locations and nobody would show up. I tried calling a hand full of different numbers associated with LYFF on many different occasions and they would never answer there phones. They have also ignored my emails about me asking simple questions about cats to this day. I filled out the preadoption questionnaire they asked if i was ok with home visits and i told them no because i wanted to protect my husband and myselfs personal safety during this COVID- 19 period. I also dont give out my address to people I don't trust and this organization has proven to be untrustworthy by there actions and how they have treated me. Since I would not allow a home visit they denied my request to adopt a cat. I later asked multiple volunteers if home visits were required for every person trying to adopt a cat and they told me they don't usually require a home visit. They obviously don't treat there customers with equality or fairness and I feel discriminated against because of it. Trying to adopt a cat through them seems almost impossible they were not accommodating in the slights. I also went to cat and craft another location they have cats at hoping to start the adoption process for a cat. I called ahead to make sure I would be assisted when I got there because they had a record of not showing up when appointments were made. When I got there I was told they couldn't help me. There attitude was extremely rude and not forthcoming what so ever. The person then lied and said that they never talked to me on the phone and never told me they could helps me to start the adoption process. I ended up adoptioning 2 super sweet little boy kittens through The Rescue House they had great customer service I recommend going through them intsead.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc77fc3123c3a1:0x4c69767941fcc0< /Gmap_id></record>

We are very happy with our adoption experience with Love Your Feral Felines and highly recommend anyone looking to adopt to check out LYFF. Through all interactions with staff I could feel they truly care about finding safe homes for cats. Our kitten came with initial vaccinations/testing, spay/neuter and microchip and the related documentation. Even after we have brought out new kitten home, I feel comfortable knowing I can reach out to LYFF with any questions or issues that may arise. The partnership with Cat & Craft Cafe was also really great because we got to see the kitten we had our eyes on interact with other cats and people which helped us ensure she would be a good fit into our family. Thank you LYFF for ALL you do to help so many cats!</text>

This is an awesome nonprofit cat rescue organization that is entirely supported by donations. Volunteer based, they are a group of generous, experienced, hard working people who save homeless cats that so few others desire to save. They work well with the community and serve their community well. There are no words to describe the immensity of their lifesaving work.<//review>

One of the worst application experiences I've ever had. As a life-long cat adopter (we've had more than six cats in the last 20 years and will never go to a breeder), this is one of those rescues that require potential pet owners to LIE in order to be approved. They rejected my family because one of our cats is indoor/outdoor, and they assumed that we would not be able to restrict our new kitten to an indoor life. They are hurting the credibility of the rescue community by denying responsible families based on personal assumptions. If you do decide to apply for one of these cats, I recommend lying on your application or you'll get denied.</review>

I love this organization and the work they do is amazing. The Barn cat program saves cats in risk of euthanasia and gives them a second chance at life. The leaders of the organization will move heaven and Earth to ensure that a cat finds a forever home. I had never met anyone before as fully committed to saving feral cats as the people in this organization. I fully recommend them!<//text>

Everything was so easy getting my cat spayed through their program, from making the reservation to drop off and pick up. The entire cost for me to get her spayed, a rabies shot, and pain meds was $20. Everyone I dealt with was very nice, and my kitty has healed beautifully. I would definitely go through them again!</review>

<review>This community of amazing people have given life back to my babies!  Not only did they help rehome the kitties that I couldn't keep but they are helping me with the beautiful feral males that live in my neighborhood!  From baths to medical care,  those beautiful animals, each and every one, has someone totally devoted to making each cat feel loved and cared for.  They stayed with a pregnant mama through birth,  just like I would have done!  NEVER have I seen people work so hard to come together for my babies that I could not keep, for their safety and my family's well being.  Thank you guys for being there for them!  I couldn't ask for better people to have my cat's best interest at heart!</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>“Adopt, don’t shop!” is easier said than done because of an organization like this. We were fully invested in adopting a cat from their adoption event and even went to two separate events on two different weekends all because we were really looking forward to adopting a kitty. This organization had us fill out a little adoption questionnaire that they would then use to decide whether we were fit to adopt. My husband and I recently had to send our handsome 90lbs 3 year old Rottweiler to his father’s home (where he previously lived with my husband and his family) due to the fact that we now live in an apartment and our doggo no longer would have the space or a big backyard that he so badly needed. A tough and selfless decision because we actually sobbed when he left. All this was explained to this organization and with all these facts,  they chose to deny our adoption application because “it doesn’t look good that you let your dog go” ... we begged for them to reconsider because we were in love with a beautiful kitty who also seemed to love us and yet we were still told “denied”. I would genuinely advise anyone applying for adoption to lie on their application if they really genuinely want to adopt from them. They scrutinize you for decisions they would’ve made themselves if they were in your place. One of the volunteers who seemed to be running the events was also ridiculously rude to us and literally embarrassed us in public just because we were playing with a kitty that we were allowed to play with. We were told “what are you doing? Don’t you know your application was denied?!” We weren’t even informed that it was denied until the moment she chose to yell it out in front of the entire event. Honestly, just an overall terrible experience.< /review>< userid>

Can’t say enough good things about this rescue. Saving so many cats from euthanasia in shelters and suffering on streets. As well as finding just the right indoor only homes for the most vulnerable kittens and following through with adopters. I’m really grateful to be able to send my family and friends to them to adopt!< /review>

<review>This organization is amazing! I adopted this sweet kitten from them over the weekend in Temecula. Everyone was so caring and helpful and the animals are all so well cared for. This sweet boy is perfect for our family and we will definitely recommend this rescue to friends and family! If you are looking for a new cat or kitten almost all their kittens are pulled from shelters on the euthanasia list and they give them all a second chance at life. My boy came neutered, vaccinated and microchipped and tested for leukemia. I couldn’t be happier or more grateful. Thank you to Love Your Feral Felines!< /review>< pics>

They save kittens from euthanasia through their foster and adoption program and make sure they go to good indoor only homes (which is by far and wide the safest option for kitties to live long and healthy lives). And they save kitties not suitable for indoor homes by placing in “barn homes” through their barn cat program which gives feral and semi feral cats a second chance at life. They also have a low cost spay and neuter person to help get kitties fixed so that they can be more healthy overall and not contribute to the overwhelming overpopulation problem. The volunteers at LYFF work tirelessly to save as many kitties as possible and are a credit to so many sweet souls that would have otherwise never had a chance. I highly recommend them.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

They care about the lives of cats and place them in the best and safest homes possible.  Where others may allow their cats to go to anyone who has an interest, LYFF works to make sure cats and adopters are well-suited so the kitties long-term well-being is protected and the adopter has the best chance possible to find their perfect match.  Top notch 501 founded by a dedicated and truly caring voice for homeless and feral cats!< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Worst application experiences. They deny responsible families off of baseless assumptions. Maybe lying on your application might get you a good chance. I explained my story to the director to get some made up decisions from her and her (board). A lot more of those cats would have a right home if they talked to the people applying. My wife left the adoption sight embarrassed because as we were getting to know a cat, we got told, " what are you doing? You guys have been denied" out loud in front of the guest at pet smart. My wife is heartbroken after all that, and all she wanted was a companion for her after we lost our dog. "non-profits" like this one make it hard for cats to find loving homes.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>LYFF is an incredible rescue! This amazing organization has saved the lives of so many cats and kittens. They not only foster and nurture cats and kittens, but when they're ready to be adopted, LYFF makes sure they're being adopted into safe environments so that they truly get a second chance at life. All the volunteers are wonderful caring people.</Text><user_id>107661132145814597873<//user_id><Gmap_id>0x80dc77fc3123c3a1:0x4c69767941fcc0< /Gmap_id>< Response>

Love Your Feral Felines is a great organization very clear and transparent. All the members have been friendly and great to work with.
They are all about providing a home to cats/kittens and saving feral cats lives.
They have two programs to save lives.
-Adoption program: For social cats/kittens to find suitable indoor homes they partner with Petsmart, Vet Offices and Cat Cafe to foster adoption of cats/kittens.
-Barn Cat program (no kittens): to rescue feral non-social cats from shelters that would otherwise be euthanized (no-kill does not apply to feral cats) and provide them barn homes to foster rodent control. They train barn owners on how to successfully adapt the cats to their new environment. This is part of their TNR program as well.< /review>

Pulled a kitten out of a four year olds hands and were very rude. After an hour filling out paperwork they told us they only allow indoor cats as adoption. Didn’t have the decency to let my daughter hold the kitten a little longer instead threw it back in the cage and never made eye contact with us again.<//text>

Love Your Feral Felines is the best non-profit cat rescue organization I’ve ever come across. You will never meet other volunteers who care more about rescuing vulnerable cats. LYFF helps those cats who are all too often cast aside by society, shelters, adopters and even other rescues: the abandoned, the sick, the relinquished, the mistreated, the shy. LYFF works tirelessly to give these forgotten cats a second chance at life. When I say they pour their blood, sweat, and tears into saving cats, I mean it literally!<//text>

This was the most horrible experience I’ve ever had with a cat adoption agency.  They were heartless, unprofessional, and contradictory.  They say they adopt out barn cats which by definition are outside cats, but when I tried to adopt a kitten with my four year old granddaughter, they let her get all attached to one and the. When I filled out the adoption form, informed me that I couldn’t have it because eventually the cat would be indoor/outdoor.  I actually wonder if one of the girls wasn’t just racist as she was so rude!  What a little twirp!  Do Not use this adoption agency!  Use anyone else.< /Text>

LYFF is an awesome organization! You couldn’t ask for more compassionate and caring founders, event coordinators, fosters, and volunteers. LYFF is all about helping the cats, doing what is in the best interest of the cats (and kittens). They have an extraordinary barn cat program. In addition, they have stepped up to save the lives of numerous, social cats and kittens (often taking the cases other rescues can’t or won’t...shy, scared, medical issues, FIV, etc.) through their adoption and foster programs.  And, they do a huge community service with low cost spay-neuter and many hours of educational outreach. Thanks, LYFF!<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I went to PetSmart the other day to get some things for my fish tank and by complete accident, walked right into a cat adoption event hosted by LYFF. I saw Gordy, the sweetest 5-month old orange tabby, and knew I had to meet him. As soon as I held him I was sold. The adoption process was smooth sailing. LYFF is staffed with very knowledgeable and passionate people who care deeply about finding these friends safe and happy forever homes. Everything is organized very professionally, with detailed applications that ensure each pet is going to a good and trustworthy home. I would do it all over again in a heartbeat. Sending infinite love to LYFF from Gordy and I!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

The Pupusas are great and I've been coming here for years! Unfortunately, they switched to cash only recently. I haven't used cash in over a decade and I don't plan on carrying some around just for this one place.

It's very unfortunate and I hope they change their minds about this.< /Text>

We came in expecting to have a wonderful dinner but when we got there all the tables were dirty and we had to wait for the lady to clean it for us but she never did the service was extremely awful the  waitress took for ever getting our food and when we got the pupusas that we ordered they where small, once we finished eating my daughter noticed that there was a hair in my drink and she didn’t even bother to Offer a discount I am am disappointed please do not go here I warn you .</Review>

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the time they take to bring your order to the table (abit long).

Waited 30 mins for 3 pupusas and when I went to go ask for them they had forgotten about my order! Plus the women working there have a really bad attitude.</Text>

<review>Be aware 10 X $10 are baby pupusas... I ordered to go and it was funny when I open my container and found tiny pupusas.  Other places have the same special but regular size pupusas. Cheese/Calabaza are $3.50 each that's pretty high.  Dissatisfied!< /review>< Name>

(Translated by Google) The food is delicious, but because the wait is so long, even if you order only two pupusas, you have to wait a minimum hour that is not good.

Esta rriquisima la comida pero porque es tan larga la espera aunque uno ordene solo dos pupusas tiene que esperar una hora minimo eso no es bueno</text>

Usually good place, but the receptionist today at 12:30pm 4/22 obviously had an attitude issue she needs to address. I was assured they would come out to let me know when the bowl was done to avoid a crowd inside the little place. I waited a long time and I was literally sitting near the door. I finally got frustrated and went inside and ask for the status. She was like "oh, we came to tell you it was ready." all rude and very childish.  Ummm okay, maybe I was deaf and blind when they came out to tell me... Don't lie and then give me attitude on top of that.</Review>

The smoothies are over priced and the service is extremely slow. I've given this place 3 chances and will not be back unless I have 30 minutes to spare... to wait for them to prepare an order.< /text>

<review>Very good, i got the large and it filled me up I don’t like granola but the granola was so good and a great mixture with açaí bowl. The fruit adds a good taste, i recommend this place if you like açaí bowls . I would come here again !!< /review><Date>1613549476216< /Date></record>

<Text>The girl at the front counter was very nice and bubbly. This was my first ever visit to a Vitality Bowl. I chose the Dragon bowl (no bananas) and added coconut shavings. A little pricey but worth it for a fresh, healthy breakfast< /Text><name>Niko Top Notch<//name>< UserId.>

Their smoothies are so bomb! No garbage in them just goodness. I love this place. This location however has not the greatest staff and huge waiting times. I placed an order online for pickup, called to make sure it was received 15’ins later and was told it was complete, arrived and my order had not even been started. 👎🏽 still great quality, just bad service at the CV location< /text>

I'VE ORDERED FROM THIS PLACE ABOUT 4 TIMES NOW. TODAY I DECIDED TO PICK UP MY ORDER INSTEAD OF USING DOOR DASH TO DELIVER. I GOT MY FOOD AND CAME BACK TO WORK AND REALIZED THEY FORGOT MY ROASTED TURKEY ON MY SALAD. I WAS UPSET BECAUSE I WAS VERY HUNGRY AND REALLY WANTED MY PROTEIN. I CONTACTED THERE LOCATION AND THEY WERE QUICK TO GIVE ME A REFUND OR COMPENSATE FOR MY NEXT ORDER. EVEN BETTER SINCE I WORKED 10 MIN AWAY, MY ROASTED TURKEY WAS BROUGHT TO ME TO ENJOY MY SALAD AND I'M SO THANKFUL AND EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THERE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND HOW THEY HANDLE THERE CUSTOMER'S WHEN THERE IS A SMALL ERROR.</Text>

This place charges you extra for everything. If I say no strawberries, no bananas and no goji berries but please add blueberries- they charge for the blueberries. I end up paying more for less when I come here and nothing in me understands that policy. I'm officially done patronizing them<//review>

< Review>
I looked for "vegan near me"...I think that most of their options have to be stripped down to be vegan and because their juicer wasn't working it limited what I could get.  I'm getti they gave vegan options, it would be nice if they could find a yummy vegan bread so that vegans could get a vegan sandwich.  I guess I just wonder why they are listed so high on Google search for vegan, when for the Bay Area I felt more limited than I expected when arriving.<//Review>

The girls here are so rude.  One of them who  was a bit younger was on her phone the whole time not attending customers and complaining in the back . It took her about 10 minutes to realize that she’s at work and she needs to come up front to assist customers waiting in line. While ordering she has the nerve to be on her phone .  And then after ordering she messes up my order so I have to go back to correct her mistakes. After placing my order it took about 30 minutes to have my order ready .  This is the worst customer service I have ever had.  Very disappointing.<//Text>

They use to be good when they first opened in Stoneridge Mall now, they got greedy and instead of focusing of high quality and affordable superfoods and blends, they skimped out and raise their prices hiring nothing but young high school Turks to do their dirty work for them, I missed when they were so gooooood! :(</review>

The smoothies are not flavorful and the panini are small. We had the tropical and sunsation. The tropical tasted like banana and the sunsation tasted like tangy banana.

It was everything. The pesto panini, oatmeal breakfast bowl (added strawberries and chia seeds), and tropical shake (forgot the real name) were all amazing and fulfilling. I'll be going back tomorrow for the 3rd time in a row and will bring a bowl on my plane ride.<//review>

First time needing this kind of service. The agent was very understanding, knowledgeable and informative. He walked us through each step of the process and made sure we were taken care of. He made the whole process easy and convenient over the phone and through email. My family truly appreciates his help and recommend him and his business to all that might be in this horrible situation. 100% Good Service!!</Review>

The website even has good information on the process, and other things you wouldn't think you could get in trouble for. I wanted to give you guys a pat in the back, because youguys really changed my mind when it comes to bail companies.

Thank you Mr. Marco for the great service. He was able to set us up on a payment plan. They gave me a discount right off the bat which I thought was awesome.

Believe when I say these are scary times, and when you throw a loved ones incarceration on top of it, the anxiety level rises to a 1000. Trust me you do not want your loved staying longer than they have to. I called many places and these guys were the BEST!! CHECK THEM OUT 👍<//text>

What can i say we ended up needing bail againnnnn! anyways we were out here in San Bernardino and i googled bail bonds and this was the first place that came up. I appreciate the fast response. I cant believe this happened again. Turns out the county being different has an affect on the situation. I couldnt have asked for better help. These guys offered me a payment plan and a discount on top of it they gave us a payment plan. Thank you so much!!</Text>

I am really happy this company remained open, Marco made the process super convenient and he posted the bail quickly. It was comforting the follow up call we received once it was posted. If you want a reliable bail service, call Marco.</Review>

To begin with i had no idea no clue whatsoever what was going on! i had had too many micheladas to realize what was happening lol. Long story short we ended up needing to bail out my cousin, who claims it was not his fault. Whatever needless to say i was upset. I googled bail and  thsi lovely company came out and they offered us a pretty sweet deal. Payment plan, discount the whole nine. Thank you so much for the patience and the professional service!!!<//review>

I really appreciate the service Marco provided us this weekend. He went above and beyond to get us a payment plan. They even gave us a discount, but that was due to our AARP. THANK YOU A MILLION!!</Text>

<review>So we came out to a function out here, things got crazy. So my cousin ended up getting arrested. I got on their chat box there to ask a couple of questions, and they were able to answer each one. I appreciate the fact that they let us know the procees. Thankfully my cousin got released on his own recognizance, but i just wanted to give these guys a THUMBS UP!! thanks Marco for the wonderful service.<//review>< Pictures>

I seriously didn't know what to do when they arrested my brother. The first thing I did was search how to get someone out of jail. Then I searched bail bonds in san  Bernadino and this company popped up. Not only did they give us a good discount, their website has all this information that's useful. I appreciate the fast service and the payment plan. Muchas gracias Marco!!!💯👍</text>

Just wanted to drop by and leave a review for this company, because they did such a great job handling our situation.  When they called me to get a hold of me  i didnt answer because i dont answer random numbers i dont recognize lol, but when i heard the message i called them back. To begin with i was shocked and concerned at the fact that i was having to bail someone out. Then when they told me the amount i needed I almost fell off my chair, who has that kind of money??? Thank goodness they offer discounts and payment plans or else it would have been county sandwiches for my family member. Thank you so much MArco, you are the real MVP!!< /text>

I was very HAPPY Marco also speaks Spanish, because my husband does not speak English! He was able to communicate with my husband and explain everything to him as well.

I just wanted to take a moment to thank you Marco for the great service you provided. We are not from the area which usually makes things more difficult, but Marco was able to meet us. I appreciate the fact that he went above and beyond to make this process work for us. He provided a 20% discount, because of my husbands union. He was also able to set us up on paymets. I cannot explain how greatfull I am since so many words cannot describe. All i can say is that in these scary moments it's good to have someone that knows what they are doing.<//review>

We decided to go with this company because we were in the area, and they offered us a good deal. As it turns out if you have good credit they offer this thing where you don't pay the first month!! Very sweet deal :) The agent was very friendly, I believe his name is Marco. Although we had gone through this process before....i guess it changes with the county so it was nice of him to explain everything. Thank you so much for the grest service.<//text>

Very professional business. It was in the middle of the night and I was calling around to many places. A lot of the bail companies that i called had no agent available or the place was closed. I was able to reach a agent at Penny's and he was very prompt and helpful. Hopefully I wont need you again, but if I do, it's Penny's Bail Bonds.< /review>

Of course you cant just settle for just anyone. These situations are too delictae. In reality they are also pricy which means unless you're rich.......you need a bail bondsman!! Good thing we had good credit. They had this program where they ask you a lot of questions to see if you qualify. Turns out we did!!

Had a bit of a situation this weekend......very scary!! As it turned out going to a bar in another hood is not a good time or idea. So anyways we had already gone through this process with my sister, so we KINDA had an idea what was going to go down. WRONG every county is a diferet situation!! The only thing we did know was to ask for discount and payment plan lol which they were able to provide. I am so grateful for Marco, he was such a reliable agent, he even met us a location since were overwhelemed with the whole deal. Thanks for all the help!!<//Review>

Long story short hat is why i had to obtain a bail bondsman. Customer service is a top priority for my family and I, sadly our family tend to get into situations lol. I am so glad i called Penny Bail Bonds for help! I am not familiar with the are so it was great that we were able to do everything over the phone. The service was fast and easy.......after a couple of these it tends to go faster since you know what to expect.

<Review>My cousin got in a bit of trouble this weekend, and we had to bail him out (we didn't have to lol but we did) so i googled San Bernardino Bail Bonds and Penny Bail Bonds popped up, i figure penny sounds affordable. It was! Very friendly people too ☺ so the nice agent that helped us out, did everything he could to get us a good deal....i think his name was Marco.

So glad to have found this company, now and days you hear things about people getting ripped of that its difficult to trust someone. After much investigating and reading reviews i decided to go with this company. Glad I did! Thanks again Marco and Penny Bail Bonds!< /review>< pics>

I came across this company, because a family member was arrested. You would think that since people are older they would avoid getting into trouble, you would also think that people would have money to situate themselves. BUT WHATEVER, whats done is done. After debating and debating we finally started calling numerous places to get them out, i called this company but in a different location and as it turned out were very friendly and informative. (like everyone else i had a different notion about bail) Mr. Marco walked us off the ledge and walked us tothrough the process. Believe me when i say when this happens to you, its like your a deer in headlights!! Research as i found out you can get discounts and payment plans. Cause really who has all this cash to pay up front??? Anywhoo ...service 5 stars :) Thanks Marco for everything.<//Text>

<review>So my brother got picked up for warrant, so like a good sister, i'm calling him every name in the book Lol. But you do for family, so i start calling so many places cause i'm trying to get a good deal. Penny Bail Bonds responded faster, and Nicer! They're also cheaper and they actually work with you. Like i said i called around.....at other places it seemed they either didn't like their job or they were having a bad day. Definately would use them again!!< /review>< pictures>

You never expect to get a call at 2 in the morning.........especially from your niece, that has been arrested! During a tough situation like this you really don't know what to do. It's not like you're walking into a candy store to purchase a recess. So i called around and Marco at Penny Bail Bonds was really helpfull! He answered all our questions, and let us know what was goint to be expected from the whole process. I would definately recommend them to someone that needs to get out of jail fast. Long story short my niece will no longer be partying, for a very long time lol.</Text>

The truth is that without the discount and the payment plan that we were offered, I don't know if we could get my cousin out of jail that fast. These situations are too expensive. Thank you very much to Mr. Marco that I work, fast and at least we agreed my cousin is already outside celebrating.

<Date>1617582333348< /Date><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I am sort of biased about Athena Grill. I have been going here for at least 15 years and have seen many changes. The Athena Grill today is putting out food almost like the first time I ate here.

Outside dining is available at this time but because of the red/orange tier levels, there is in door dining.

The food can be fantastic to good. Every place has a bad day but for the most part the food is very good. I enjoy the sample plate when I can't decide and the wife seems to order the gyro plate at every opportunity.

Service used to be great, now just slightly above average.

Still a most try for greek cuisine.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqLSnU7X3lg-NuyOQ4InT6nJgfw7pI96km07eA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyg890-rbFHxWiTWKr960PtORIjJwJJA669yn5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUSpjwIByABkzQAaN-ruoaiZQWi8DiungOWzbD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNftYNp0hUbi3BXuqX2lVEvOdN3kbcbCpBEhUNC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNleMdRkuulwvcwwJN9R-sdk_rtIZI9Xf3pVTFk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUC78D13boulPYyuQpjH_JgJvOmaH7B4iYXZrq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_0Xw0NpmbFzZi7aoS5zmdoVtkh-cyvyeonyV2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNduRUdnvcMf38VXuw83nHJH3IVQBTqKWaPbEjo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808fca283052b81f:0x97b199e3951a5818</gmap_id></record>

Athena has been a go to staple for many years.  It has always been consistently good. The food, the service, the atmosphere. It's tucked away in a commercial, light industry area of town, but thats of no worry. I usually go with the steak pita wrap and calamari appetizer, but the menu is large enough to satisfy anyone. Highly recommended!</text>

This place was great. My boss took us all here for lunch today at a company trip. This place has truly embraced Mediterranean food in essence. Great setting and the staff was just as great as the menu. Appetizers we perfect so were the main  dishes. Super positive setting and vibe to the place as well. Extremely comfortable place to eat.</Review>

Came here with the wife doe lunch. Even though it was packed we were sat quickly and the waiter was super nice.

Started with an amazing bread basket and I got some Greek coffee. I got the falafel and my wife got the chicken souvlaki. Both were packed with super fresh veggies and you could taste the knowledge and care they put into their food. The falafel in particular was super moist and not at all dry.

Ended with the baklava and they let us relax without pushing to turn the table. I highly recommend you head here if you are in the area.< /Review>

Sit out area is now also available with nice ambience. The hummus and chips they brought out first was so fresh. We had stuffed leaves and grilled octopus for appetizers.</review>< pics>

<review>Lunch on a weekday. Staff was very friendly but the food was average to below average. Meat in the steak wrap was tough and tasted as if it was not freshly cooked. Spanakopita taste was a little off and somewhat bland. Whatever oil or butter was used in it tasted old. The garlic fries were lukewarm at best. The glass of wine I was served for $11 was clearly the bottom of the bottle. It tasted oxidized, and they didn't hesitate to pour all of the sediment into my glass. Sauces were good, but only because they were mostly garlic. Greek Salad was also good. Probably an OK lunch restaurant for an industrial park, but certainly not a destination eatery.</review>< date>

Decent place. Parking is a problem & you need to park on road. Food is decent. You get complimentary Pita Hummus. We loved the fried Pita. We ordered Caesar salad and Egg Plant Wrap with Fries. The wrap was OK - lacked flavor. Fries were cold & dint taste so good because they were not salted. It has a nice patio seating<//Review>

The restaurant always looks busy, so I thought I would try it. I ordered few items. The only good thing was the octopus salad. The other dishes we ordered were not as expected.
The bread and hummus that were served before the food were good, actually the best part of the experience. The staff were not professional also. I don't think I will go back.<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Exceptional taste!! The chicken pita and the greek salad with falafels are an absolute hit! I usually just alternate between the two every time I get food from here. The fries are perfectly seasoned as well. Their portions are pretty big so I can never eat more than one thing at a time, but I always enjoy their food and friendly service.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Service was amazing. Nice atmosphere, staffnwas wearing masks. Very reasonable prices.

The Mezes Krasiou was absolutely fantastic as well as the chicken wrap. The  gyro plate was bad (too spacy too much fat) but the salad and garlic fries were great. Can't recommend the backlava (cinnamon ruined otherwise it would have been lovely).

We will go back for sure, next time we choose more wisely.< /Review>< Pics>

Big portions, great service with warmth, affordable pricing and of course amazing food! Sit out area also available with nice ambience.

Not very crowded at dinner times. So a recommended place if you want to avoid the crowds and have a peaceful evening.</Text>

My favorite Greek restaurant in the South Bay. Food is consistently delicious. Service is great. The owner is a very good man, and makes you feel at home. When I first ate here as a kid, the owner let me, my brother, and my friend take a picture holding a replica of the Olympic torch from the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. Love the pastisio, chicken souvlaki wrap, and of course some Galaktoboureko for dessert (which they only make on Fridays). 😋😋😋<//text>

Their wraps are the best! Highly recommend the lamb pita wrap and the lamb souvlaki wrap. High-quality cuts of meat, fresh veggies and tasty tzatziki. Also the portion is generous. I feel like they try to stuff the pita with as much topping as possible.

Plus, they serve fries with a pink-ish sauce that tastes insanely good. Love it.< /review>

Menu has good vegitarian choices. We like their pita wraps. It is little pricey, but food is tasty and fresh. Service is great too.< /text>

Very simple and easy to cater with! Just call and state how many people you are hosting and Athena knows exactly how much food and which foods to reccomend! The lamb and shrimp entrees were the favorite by far at my events so I'd just reccomend ordering more of those.< /Text>

< Review>
Good ambience, good food and variety , casual place, outdoor seating. They have variety options for vegetarians chicken, seafood, lamb, pork, beef. They serve pita and hummus upon arrival. We went for dinner, it was not crowded and we waited really long to get our main course but otherwise overall good experience.</Review>

The gyro sandwich here absolutely destroyed my concept of what a good gyro sandwich was.  No joke, I almost went back in and got another one it was so good.  I'll definitely be back here next time I'm in the area... I'm almost already looking forward to it now.</review>

Right before my predecessor retired she said this restaurant is one of the Company favorites. To find a restaurant where everyone enjoys the food with no complaints is no small feat with this office.

Taki the Catering Director is awesome and always responds to my (multiple) questions and changes quickly. The Tri Tip (Moschari Psito) is amazing. Both of the chicken dishes that I have ordered (Chicken Souvlaki and Reganati) are phenomenal. All meats are always cooked perfectly, even with ordering for nearly 100. Everything is cooked perfectly including the rice and grilled vegetables. They don't skimp on the portions either. Thank you all so much!</Text>

Food tasted great, but too much garlic.
Our placemats had spots in them and utensils needed a better cleaning. If you go there don't expect a luxury place, rather a good taste.< /text>

<Review>Went here for dinner with a few friends. Food was absolutely delicious. The hummus and chips they brought out first was so fresh 👌. We had stuffed leaves and grilled octopus for appetizers. The grape leaves had a simple but lovely flavor. First time trying octopus-so good! Entrees were also amazing. I had the seafood kabob. Such good flavor. Rice pudding dessert was sooo good. 10/10 highly recommend<//Review>< time>

We were disappointed that they were out of taramosalata and the sardine special, but we really enjoyed the Athena salata with added swordfish,  the steak pita wrap, a couple of Greek beers, and walnut cake with Greek coffee for dessert. And the friendly, quietly attentive service!<//Review><Date>1597703411993<//Date><UserId.>105468866763692133104< /UserId.>< Rating>

The food and service were fairly okay and the ambience was really pleasant. The waiter did throw his chefs under the bus for the amount of time it took to get the food to come out, but seemed apologetic enough about it. The desserts were nice as well. The first picture is an Athenian Chicken wrap.< /review>

Nice ambience with outdoor seating, ample amount of parking is available.

Falafel and the grills are the best option. Also the salad options are great.

Service is also exemplary, that’s a good sign for any dining restaurant. Just waiting for the reopening of this restaurant post “shelter in place” to dine at Athena Grill.</Text>

Wonderful, authentic Greek spot that is off the busy path of the area. Their hummus plate was amazing and the gyro was to die for!! Friendly workers as well.< /text>

They are catering professionals. I had them cater my office party not to long ago. I was worried that the order would be wrong since our communication wasn't that clear. However everything turned out way better than I had expected. They were professional. Food was amazing, especially the chicken skewers! Everyone complimented us on the food. We will most definitely be ordering again and highly recommend.</review>

Good good. Owner tries his best to make sure people are happy, maybe a little too much. One big issue is there is limited street parking and it can take really a while to park your car.<//text>

I come here pretty often for work lunches and am always blown away by how delicious and high quality the food is! A great place you can rely on when you need a great restaurant to wow clients. This morning I placed a huge to go order and asked to have it ready at noon. Sure enough, it was all set and they actually went though the whole order with me to make sure everything was there and even helped me take it to my car. Above and beyond customer service!</review>

$$ priced mediterranean food which was just about average. Nothing really stood out to me. The grilled octopus was lacking flavor, the wraps weren’t packed too well and the mixed platter was a little dry.</Text>

Amazing food! I love the authenticity and their service. Always willing to accommodate any order. The veggies taste fresh and their meat is always cooked perfectly. Some of my favorites are the falafel plate and the gyro plate.</Review>

This was my first time eating there but I eat Mediterranean food at least a few times a week and it was good. It is a family owned spot and they are super friendly and accommodating. I'm not sure what the sauce is they give you for fries but it is delicious (I think it is tatziki with sumac in it). Service is quick even during a rush.<//Review>

<Text>Wow! What an incredible surprise. Best greek food I have had in the Bay. I was lucky enough to try it on Friday, also when they have their special lemon desert pastry which is a must (had a crazy name I can't remember). Definitely looking forward to going back. Gyros, garlic fries with best olive dipping sauce I have had. Pita and hummus is comped for guests as well.</Text><Gmap_id>0x808fca283052b81f:0x97b199e3951a5818<//Gmap_id></record>

It seems great Mediterranean restaurant near silicone valley. Meat, vegetables, and cheese, everything is great. It's usually very crowded and there is a long line, but it's worth to wait.<//Review>

A great restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating, an excellent, attentive staff and tasty food. I had a dinner with salad and gyro. My associate had the lamb chops. Both were excellent. The wine nice. The value good. If you're in the area, it's well worth a visit.< /Review>< Rating>

I got lamb souvlaki plate and my gf got gyro wrap. They also bring complimentary plates, and my review for each here:

Complimentary plates:
They bring complimentary salad, humus and pita plate. They have deep fried pita (they call it chipped pita) which was included in the complimentary pita plate and it is delicious! They were kind enough to bring more of chipped pita when we asked for it. There was too much garlic in the hummus, it was like a garlic paste as opposed to hummus lol. But hey it was complimentary.

Main plates:
Lamb souvlaki tasted a bit dry, but it was still okay. It comes with rice and veggies.  The gyro in my gf's wrap was delicious, it was thick yet tender. It came with fries which were also delicious.

I should also add that service here was great, it was quick and the server was very responsive.</Text>

This was my second visit to Athena while traveling for business. The food is amazing and the restaurant is really well decorated. I just returned from a trip to Greece and felt like I'd gone back for a few hours. Great food, excellent service. Thank you!< /review>

<review>I've been coming to Athena Grill for years. What brings me there time after time is the authenticity and great service. I tried both meat and seafood dishes. All of them are delicious and presented well, not to mention hummus and olive spread. And if you are a fan of true Greek style coffee you'd enjoy it at Athena. After all, this is the best Greek food restaurant in the Bay Area.<//review><date>1556537770474< /date>< Gmap_id>

This restaurant is located in the jungle of companies and factories with no parking spaces. But it is particularly popular.  The kebab and lamb are great and worthwhile revisiting<//text>

<Text>First visit after seeing this place reviewed on "Check, Please! Bay Area" and the show's unanimous positive reviews were spot on.

Decided to have a weekday lunch, went early, around 11:20a to beat the peak lunch crowd. The ordering line gets long very quickly around 11:45a and available table seating sparse soon thereafter.

My wife ordered the "Swordfish Souvlaki Wrap" and I the "Lamb Souvlaki Plate." The swordfish wrap was a bit messy to eat by hand with the fish and sauce juices dripping. The fish was seasoned well, not overly salted. Overall, delicious. The lamb plate came with a Greek style salad, sauteed veggies, decent portion side of rice, single kabob of well seasoned lamb. Again, tasty and enjoyable.

We plan to revisit and try other dishes.< /Text>< Date>

<Text>The service here was spectacular. You can really tell they value their customers and were willing to accommodate requests. The food was really tasty. I had falafel, which was not the best I have had, but still good and flavorful. Everything else was top notch. Welcome atmosphere, casual and relaxing. Would definitely go again! Great Service, Delicious food, Nice atmosphere. Always willing to substitute if requested. Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. No complaints at all</Text>< Pictures>

Oh my gosh this is delicious barbecue. It’s newer, so it’s a really nice space. All the standards, and all the sides. They even have a specialty brewed beer that you can only get here, I think. Great local beer selection. You definitely want to go if you’re not vegetarian or vegan.<//text>

My husband and I stayed in Santa Clara for a couple of days, and had dinner here one night. Wonderful service, reasonable prices, very clean and phenomenal authentic Greek food. Quaint atmosphere and definitely a great find while visiting. Every plate that came out looked delicious and my lamb pita was delicious.

Update: It was so good, we actually came back for dinner two nights later (during a 4 night stay). Great service and good again!<//Text>

Came here around 8pm , there wasn’t a lot of people. There was no wait time. Ordered the Gyro Plate which is sliced beef served over a pita wrap with Tzatziki sauce & red onion served with garlic fries. The beef was really tender. There was kind of a lot of red onions but other than that it was really good.</text>

<review>The owner is so friendly. It's a great spot for lunch and dinner. The food is tasty, reasonably priced and they give you relatively large portions. The service is also pretty fast (especially when it's not lunch hour). The parking can be a bit of a mess - there's a tiny lot but most of it is street parking. I try not to come here at noon on weekdays because it gets a little chaotic, but it's a great spot for Greek food if you're in the mood and in the area.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>This place is very tasty, and the staff is really, really friendly. The garlic fries are super garlicky, and I loved the olive spread. This place is a cut above some of the other Greek/ Mediterranean places around, but it's also a tiny bit on the pricy side. If it were a tad cheaper, I'd probably eat there once or twice a week.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

The food is good but it feels like its more the pricey side.  I had the chicken kabob thing and the chicken was tender and delicious but nothing outstanding or unique about the flavor.  The rest of the plate was just rice and salad which made it look bigger than it was.  Portion wise, I was full which is not a cheap feat.</review>

I am always blown away by the freshness of their salads. Prices are moderate. I have only been there for dinner, and there are only a few people being served. There must be a huge lunch crowd that keeps this gem going!< /Review>

I ordered catering from Athena's Grill this last week for a company event and it went over very well. The person that helped deliver was quick and efficient. For any online orders the customer should include the tip before hand as they did not have signed receipts. Our company really enjoyed the spread and left overs were taken home. Thank you Athena Grill!

<Text>Ordered the Chicken Souvlaki Plate and it was delicious tender chicken, soft rice with a side of veggies. The hummus that came with the bread basket was amazing. The atmosphere of the place was delightful. The owner was very kind and interacted with the customers asking the meals were. The service was pretty fast, I just sat down and the food was ready already. Overall would definitely come back and bring more friends to try it out.</Text><date>1529525289967< /date>< rating>

Always one of my local favorite restaurants. If you're doing strict Keto, get the salmon with extra veggies.

Otherwise, get the Yiro plate with garlic French fries! Yum yum. The purple tart sauce is the perfect dipping sauce for the French fries.

Lunch time bread and hummus is complimentary, and really good. Just come early to secure good table (inside or outside).

The owner is a older, friendly chap. He always stops by every table and ask how the food and service is. 5/5 stars all the way< /text>

Plate servings are huge! Ordered a Moussaka and ate it for lunch and dinner. Got to know later that I could have asked for a fruit bowl instead of fries. The olive dip that came with the fries was pretty good and the salad reminded me of the Olive garden salad. Very tasty! Bechamel in Moussaka was perfect!
A friend got a chicken wrap, he didn't seem very happy with it.<//Text>

Great food. This place is a bay area institution of sorts. The service is great. The lamb chops are to die for. And don't leave without Greek coffee to top it all of.< /Review>

One of the best greek places around, they are super nice, have some really awesome interior decorations, including a torch from the Olympics. I've never had anything here I didn't like, and the wait staff are super nice, food prep is quick. There is also outdoor seating in a little enclosed terrace area out front on the street corner, and parking behind the Linux server store for he restaurant. I recommend any of the gyros, and their baklava and galaktaburego is to die for!< /Text>

Our waiter was personable & helpful with his suggestions. We ordered a combo plate and shared it. This had us tasting a variety of dishes. All were wonderful. We also enjoyed that we could talk and hear each other without bouncing acoustics causing us to speak up or talk into each other's ears. Definitely going back.< /Review>

<Text>Excellent food - biftekia, wraps, especially lamb pita wrap. You are not going to find lamb wraps/gyro in Greece now days, as the meat is too expensive vs what they can charge. Or you'll find it in the ground mix with more  herbs and fried oil then lamb. And all that  for 12$, in the heart of Silicon  Valley. Seems they make their own hummus and also, raspberry sauce you get with fries is awesome. Fries are extremely good. Seems they use good ingredients and know how to do it...

What's better than in Greece is the gyros comes with fries aside, not in the gyros.

The owner is always around and makes sure everything is right. Same employees for last 10 years tells a lot. Recently they've put lemons and olives around the place to make it look "right". Lots of outdoor seating< /Text>< Pics>

Delicious food and great environment. The service is very busy for lunch, so be prepared or get in early. Our food arrived quite late, but I believe it was because my coworker ordered something that took a long time to prepare. Overall, fantastic restaurant!<//text>

A walk up counter restaurant with the food brought to your table. Quaint atmosphere, outdoor dining available. Busy everytime we go with a 5 minute wait in line, but can always easily find a table.  Loved everything we've ordered. Great Greek food!</Text>

<Review>Definitely try the dip sampler option on the menu and the prices recently went up after being featured on the food network.

It’s completely worth it and the service really is wonderful.

Portions are huge and no reservation is really needed most of the time.< /Review>< user_name>

Came for dinner on a weeknight & only a few tables were occupied. The chicken gyro was delicious & came as a huge portion with a tasty side salad.

The resto has an outdoor patio area as well with several tables.

Only feedback is on service - servers weren't all that attentive l, especially given the restaurant wasn't busy.

The food though is superb for the area.</Review>

<review>I've visited Athena Grill a few times, usually for lunch. Their falafel are very tasty, and I've enjoyed their baklava every time I've ordered it too. The staff has always been nice, and I've had no problems with dining in or ordering takeout. Vegetarian options are clearly marked, which is very helpful.<//review>< rate>

The food was excellent. The large outdoor patio has lots of seating. Street parking was easy to find. A great lunch spot!< /Review>

Athena Grill is one of the best Greek restaurants I have ever eaten at. I ordered at the front with a recommendation from the gentleman that helped take my order. My food came out quickly, everything was fresh and delicious and I have never enjoyed octopus more! It was so tender and so much flavor! I organize events often and can't wait to use their catering services to wow my guests!< /Review>

<review>I was looking for a bit more of a traditional & authentic place to get Greek food (more than just a gyro or basic meat plate y'know..) and stumbled across Athena. They're situated amongst a bunch of companies, so I'm sure it's pretty busy during the work week. However, on the weekend, it's very quiet around the restaurant and almost like a tiny paradise! The food was excellent--my fiance hadn't tried much like dolmas before, so it was a bit of an adventure for him, but he loved it. Portions were enough for leftovers for the both of us, and service was very friendly. I want to go back and try more soon!</review>< Resp>

I have been eating lunch here for past 10 years, great place to eat Greek food. Long line at lunch time but worth it. The owner makes you feel at home and will help anyhow he can. I think, he enjoys hanging out with his customers and he is nice to his staff.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Generous portions, fast service. Busy during lunch hour. Indoor, outdoor sitting. Very limited parking space. I ordered Lamb short ribs, which was disappointing. French fries in my order ( and others in our group) we're soggy. I ended up getting a refund for my dish.

Excellent recipes with high quality food. This is a gem of a place. Plenty of patrons but not too busy. Family operated decor, simple and very comfortable. The owner /host is super friendly and wants everyone to feel at home there.</Text>

Visited this place for the first time.  Everything went right beyond imagination.

Menu choices were excellent...  Staff attentive...  Manager patient and attentive, etc.

Food comes out even before we can even take the first sip of our drinks.  Kabobs were warm and juicy, sides were delicious.  I would suggest you definitely try the chicken kabobs.

A gem.. planning to visit them often in future.<//review>

Excellent!  Came here for lunch with a friend for the first time. This place is no secret as evident by the big crowds. Downside is parking is tough. Line to order food at the counter and then the food is brought to your table. Complimentary basket of hummus with pita and bread. I only ate a little of it because I wanted to save room for my lunch  I ordered some type of vegetarian pita (eggplant) and it was really good. The pita was soft and fresh and delicious. There were many things on the menu that I want to try so I'll be back.< /text>

<Name>Kendra Nunes<//Name><review>Ordered the Greek Goddess salad. Asked for chicken to be added. Was told they were out of the chicken and offered prawns instead. Was surprised to find that the prawns cost an additional &10! Yikes. That meant I had a salad that was barely enough to meet the criteria for a meal and it cost $25. Not worth it. I would have appreciated being told the prawns (5 of them) would be a hefty added charge, especially since they were totally out of the chicken. Also, when I asked for change for a $10 bill the waiter said he couldn't do it because he didn't have access to the cash drawer. Huh? The lamb gyro was just okay, according to both my friends who had it. They said they'd had better at food trucks. Not worth the hefty price.< /review>< Rate>

Wonderful salad. The falafel were really tasty (I'm picky when it comes to falafel). The soft Greek music and the blue and white decor made me feel like I was eating in Greece. All I needed was the sound of the Mediterranean surf. The owner was on duty and was very friendly. They had just finished serving a huge party of people. They got us a table right away and the food was fast. I will come back again with friends!</Review>

Very good Greek food prepared and presented well at reasonable prices in a casual atmosphere. I prefer dinner as it is far less crowded than lunch. It's off the main street locations on Space Park and we'll worth finding.< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Date>1521405337710</Date><username>joe steidl</username><text>Tl;Dr: great food, even better service.

While waiting in the typically long lunch rush wait line, I was approached by whom I can only assume is the manager and he told me to watch where he goes. He then meandered through the full tables in the room to a small side table. At this place he looked back to me and gave me a thumbs up, after this gesture he placed a metal "Reserved" card on the table. This isn't something that has happened to me everytime I've been there, but it shows that they care about the wait time customers face when trying to eat here. They have your typical Greek staples and if you like Greek food, you will enjoy this place.< /text>< gmapID>

<text>Our office loves Athena Grill! We tried the salmon this time and OMG it was delicious. Their sides are the only thing I would improve on- pasta is just penne and sauce, veggies are okay, garlic fries get soggy fast, spanakopita is not the best. But their meats, sauces, and bread is amazing< /text>< Pics>

Very crowded place esp on Friday lunch. Waited like 20 mins. Ordered the tender lamb skew. Wasn't as tender as I thought.</text>

Overcooked vegetables that had lost all attractive texture and Keenan's that were overdone on the outside and underdone on the inside.  The plate was enough for for three adults to have a good sized meal.  The hummus was reasonable.</Review>

<Review>Wow - some of the best Greek food on the Bay Area is served here. I've been to Greece several times before and this place servers authentic Greek food. Their gyros is amazing and everything lamb tastes just excellent. I also love their tzaziki which is home made. Their portions are a good size but that also comes with a rather high price tag. Their outdoor seating area is lovely and usually really quiet. The radio plays Greek music and makes you forget time.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Extremely Disappointing!
We went to Athena's to try an enjoy the food we loved in Greece.  What we got was so disappointing that I can't believe it was served.  Nothing was hot, the salad and the supposedly cooked items where the same temperature.  The Mousaka had melted cheese, but I don't know how.  It was cold in the middle and I had to ask them to warm it up.

To add insult to injury, it was an expensive lunch.

We will never go back!!<//review><GmapID>0x808fca283052b81f:0x97b199e3951a5818<//GmapID></record>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Just ate here with some friends of mine. I had the gyro plate, and it tasted great! The servers were friend and quickly took care of us.

My favorite part of the dinner was when the owner walked around saying hello to everybody.  He came up to our table and told us about his experience being an Olympic torch bearer in Greece. (There's a torch on the wall so it wasn't out of the blue.) Overall, we had a blast. I look forward to eating here again soon!<//Review>< Pictures>

Very polite people and great food. The only thing was that we had to wait for a very long time until someone shows up to for the check. I had to go inside and ask for it at the end.< /text>

Gyros are great here and I highly recommend anything lamb here.< /Text>< Pics>

Gyros meat is moist & well seasoned & makes a perfect add to Athena's delicious Greek Salad. Generous portions. Efficient handling of crowds at lunchtime. Close in parking can be a challenge at peak times.</text>

<Name>Mauricio Park< /Name><review>It's so hard finding a seat during lunch time.  Best come with a friend so one of you can save a table.  It has gotten popular during the past few years and its no suprise why.  This place is great.  I haven't been really disappointed with anything I ordered here.
I dream about their gyros and fries with the purple stuff. I want some of that purple stuff.<//review><Response>None</Response>< Rate>

Counter service restaurant.Food is delivered to the table. Expect just a few words spoken from staff your entire meal.  That will be from the cashier and the server delivering your plate.   Lunch was pretty fast paced.

A server quickly dropped some pita and a few minutes later hummus nary a word and didn't stop. Pita os both fried and plain. Fried was different and of course, good. It is fried bread after all.  Hummus was typical.

Everyone enjoyed their lunch. I had a gyro plate. Meat was both way overcooked and just right. I didn't mind either way. Lunch rush is like that.  Fries were a disappointment being soft. Blah.  Salad was great as was the tzatziki.

I'll come back again. I'd give the place 3.5 stars if I could.<//text>

Started a little shaky - it took nearly 5 minutes before someone would talk with us, and they couldn't find our reservation. But after being seated, the service was fantastic and the food was amazing. We will definitely be back - a great find.<//Text>

Great dips, got the trio for an appetizer with friends and the cheese one is phenomenal.  The lamb gyro (forget the actual name for it though,  it was very similar) was very yum and i was able to get in two more meals from it :) (some might eat all in one sitting though)<//text>

<UserId.>111900993939235809465< /UserId.><time>1537036464527< /time><Text>Went to this place for the first time, yesterday, because my family saw them on Check Please Bay Area. We went here to celebrate a birthday and were hugely disappointed.

The visit was on Friday 8/14/18, at about 5:00pm . The place wasn't busy.

The food was average at best, but average is being nice.

The complementary meze hummus was the best item we ate. It tasted like it was made in house.

As for our meals.. I had the Gyros Plate. It had a generous amount of meat, tomato and red onion flooded with tzatziki sauce. A little restraint on the sauce would have been nicer. The meat was ok tasting andvedible. The side of Garlic fries had zero taste of garlic, was cold and limp and inedible.

Another member of my family had a plate with fish and shrimp of some kind and was also hugely disappointed. Way too much oil on the plate.

No server came to ask how everything  was, because we would have told them our fries were cold, limp, and didnt taste of garlic.

We couldn't get out of here soon enough.

We had hopes we could find a new place we could enjoy and place in our dining rotation, but this was a huge miss for my entire family.</Text>< pics>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>We enjoyed the Greek food we had on a trip to Greece so we wanted to try this place since it had good ratings on Yelp.

It was disappointing.  Food was barely room temperature.  It was like taking out food from the fridge and letting the food sit out for a while to  make it room temperature.

We ordered chicken and beef souvlaki plate, mousaka, and octopus mezes.  We've had souvlaki and mousaka before so we know these are dishes are served hot (or at least warm).  We've never had mezes though so we're not even sure if that's supposed to be served with the octopus at least warm in a bed of greens, of it it just got cold.  The octopus was cooked tender though so one star for that.

Solid Greek classics, very popular with the tech crowd for lunch.  Always packed at noon, arrive a bit earlier to snag a table in the expansive shaded outdoor seating.< /text>

It's right in middle of lots of companies. So this place gets crowded during lunch time. Try to reach earlier around 11:30 am. Food is good here.< /text>

I was excited to visit this eatery for seeing it on Check Please on PBS this weekend. While waiting in line to order (you order first, then find a table to sit)I saw delicious plates go buy. Unfortunately what I ordered was not freshly made. I had the combination platter. I was told they ran out of Pastitsio so I could substitute more Spanakopita or Mousaka or stuffed grape leaves. Unfortunately the Spanakopita and Moussaka were reheated, soggy and tasted rewarmed- not fresh. The french fries were also "limp and soggy" and "not crispy hot" and could not stand up to holding them to put into the small dish of delicious kalamata dipping  sauce. I expected the phyllo dough in the spanakopita to have a "crunch" but it was so soggy I had to cut it with a fork. what a disappointment. The Mousaka was not even thoroughly heated through and was dry. I think if I had selected a grilled skewer item cooked to order it would have been a better choice. My husband had the beef tenderloin skewer souvlaki. It was done perfectly to medium rare, juicy and hot.
The staff were very friendly and helpful.  I had told our server that I had just seen the restaurant on Check Please and so excited to come. She said it has been televised 3 times. Truly a disappointment for driving 40 miles one way.</review>

Very interesting place with fairly down-to-earth food.  Appears to be patronized by Greek, so I am guessing it is fairly legit.  Not the most decorated place but does the job.<//Text>

< Review>
Years ago it was a great place for good Greek food but sadly with he years the prices went up and the quality went down. The food is very average, the service is nothing to write home about. I got the gyro wrap which is ok but the fries it came with were horrible dry and overcooked. Much better for a quick lunch is Nick the Greek or Agape for restaurant setting.< /Review>

<Review>It's an ok place.  Gyro was not shaved but was made of patties which is super weird. Veggies on the side were in some kind of oil and were mushy. Salad had plenty of damaged/ bad leaves.  That's my experience. Didn't wanna take any chance with dessert so skipped it. WAY too overpriced for the quality and quantity.<//Review><gmap_id>0x808fca283052b81f:0x97b199e3951a5818<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Excellent food here, usually get lamb plates. My Persian friends think this is a pretty authentic taste.</Review>

<review>My server was impeccable with his service. Having ordered Dolma, Souvlaki (which came with a salad) and Baklava. He brought each plate in succession as if it were a course. What was most impressive was his attention and promptness. My water glass was never empty and the next plate arrived as I finished the one prior. Unfortunately, the flavors of my meal were neutral to the palate. The location was within a business park which made for a quiet and relaxing ambiance. Furthermore, the landscaping is done excellently so that you can enjoy shade during an afternoon lunch.</review><Date>1375687650348< /Date>< Rate>

A hidden place in Santa Clara to have a great greek dinner or lunch. The portions are huge, the service is good, and everything on the menu is amazing. Try the lamb souvlaki and order a plate of fruit.< /Text>

This place was awesome. I believe there were a few greek people working while I was there. I had an awesome Athenian Pita which was chicken with peppers, feta, and tzatzíki. I thought the food had awesome flavors. At the end of the meal they just made loukoumades (fried dough with honey and almonds) and gave us a sample which were amazing!<//Review>

<Text>We enjoyed great service and wonderful food in the lovely back patio at Athena Grill, where the Mezés Krasioú (Loukánika, lamb souvláki, chicken souvláki, biftékia on bed of fresh cut fries) was AMAZING, as was the moussaka and spanikopita. Some reviewers think it's odd that Athena Grill serves french fries as a side, but what fried these are! Cut fresh from potatoes with just the right amount of bits of skin still on, perfectly cooked, these fries are just right for enjoying the spill of sauces from the main dishes they accompany. Generous portions, easy parking along the streets in the light-industrial park area.< /Text>< pics>

This place was awesome. I believe there were a few greek people working while I was there. I had an awesome Athenian Pita which was chicken with peppers, feta, and tzatzíki. I thought the food had awesome flavors. At the end of the meal they just made loukoumades (fried dough with honey and almonds) and gave us a sample which were amazing!</review>

This place has great food and is always packed for lunch. You need to show up at 11-ish for lunch or you'll be standing in the line going out the door.< /text>

<Time>1493335018139</Time><review>They do not have fresh meat here, at least for the gryo its frozen from a plastic bag. Its beef too. Dont get the lamb gyro as its like they just pulled some fatty pieces off a rib and threw in waaaay too many red peppers, gross.

The beef gyro is just gross, frozen meet from packaging, onions were in large chunks, tomatoes with stems, wilted lettuce. This is really crappy food for a large cost.

No sliced meet from a heated spinning rod??? WHHHAATTTT??? nope this isnt greek. $$$$$$$$$ for maybe something worth $4 bucks tops. I've been to better greek at a togo place for WAAAAAAY cheaper.< /review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Decent Greek food affordable prices but very poor vine selection. They only had on Retsina wine on the list that came in a 500ml bottle with beer cap and the vine was really bad. Then we tried Post Cabernet recommended by the waiter that was just mediocre.
The service was good but we came away disappointed by the wine selection.</Review>

Hidden gem, great delicious greek food, serving lunch and dinner (same menu, but price for dinner is a bit more), indoor and outdoor seating, parking can be very difficult to find during peak lunch on fridays, lunch time inside is always be busy - so be ready to wait :) but worth the wait.< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) We visited for lunch and had delicious Greek food with a lot of volume. There are many customers and it is very lively. For lunch, the style is such that food is delivered after ordering and accounting with a cashier. Water is self-service.
I couldn't compare it because I've never had Greek food elsewhere, but it was delicious!

ランチに訪問、ボリュームがあって美味しいギリシャ料理をいただきました。お客も多くてとても活気があります。ランチはキャッシャーで注文&会計してから料理が運ばれてくるスタイル。お水はセルフサービス。
他でギリシャ料理を食べたことがないので比較できないが、美味しかった！< /Review>< Name>

(Translated by Google) A very cozy place where music and decoration remind of the Greek atmosphere. The gyro pita wrap was delicious, the dressings and the bread are the best. Recommendable.

(Translated by Google) It did not fit the taste of our party. Rice was so oily and lacked liver that I could not taste it.

(Translated by Google) There were 3 types of bread that came out when I ordered a dish, and the taste was delicious. Greece is close to Turkey, so the food is Turkish. The seafood dishes were delicious. This shop suddenly appears in an area with many factories and warehouses. It was a little scary when I went to the night because the area around the shop was dark. The parking lot is also dark. There were more people parked on the street even though the parking lot was vacant. It is close to San Jose Airport. Is the store's reputation good? The inside of the store was almost full during my stay. The clerk was nice as well. There are many terrace seats, so I would like to go during the day.

(Original)
料理を注文したときに出てくるパンが3種類あって味も美味しくかったです。ギリシャはトルコに近いこともあって料理はトルコ料理風です。海鮮系の料理が美味しかった。工場とか倉庫が多くあるエリアに突然このお店が現れます。夜に行くとお店の周辺が暗いのでちょっと恐かったです。駐車場も暗いです。駐車場は空いているのに路上駐車してる人のほうが多かった。サンノゼ空港に近いです。お店の評判はいいのか滞在中の店内はほぼ満席が続いていました。店員さんも普通に良かったです。テラス席も多くあり日中も行ってみたい。</Text>
