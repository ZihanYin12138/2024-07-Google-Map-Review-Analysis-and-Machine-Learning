Mr Chuck is a really good man and his price is very reasonable. I got my ford escape Key fob programmed and in few seconds he got it programmed. He is very Honest and Friendly and professional person to do bussiness with. If you want to save your time and money, he is the guy who you can trust.

Highly recommended!!</Text>

Great service, been using them for years. Recently my son's fob broke and Chuck the owner explained how to get the car started over the phone. Would never go anywhere else.</review>

<text>I usually come here to get my keys copied. Service is fast and convenient. This time I went to see if he can get my file cabinet safe to open. Unfortunately, I bought the cabinet for a really good deal, but didn't have the combination code to open it. Chuck was able to refer me to his friend Jerry and he ended up figuring out the code within 45mins without damaging it and for a good price! Came out a happy camper! Thank you. Definitely  recommend this place.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Chuck was very professional and honest. He programmed my key fobs for my truck. I chatted with him while he was programming them. He is one of the most stand up guys I ever met. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a great locksmith.</review>

Chuck was incredible. Came in clutch for me! I called him and he stayed open extra late for me, only to give me a free key because he wasn't 100% it would work. The key ended up working great! Really glad to have Chuck and his business around. Couldn't recommend him more.</review>

I’m so thankful that I found Dr. Ghadiri and his team. They are wonderful. Dr. Ghadiri was very knowledgeable and explained everything very clear to me. The entire team was so welcoming to me and made me feel like I’ve known them for years. They also have a wonderful hygienist and so sweet. I am so happy that me and my family will be coming here. Such a gem office.<//text>

<review>Super friendly office staff, skilled hygienists, and awesome dentists! I’ve been visiting this office for years (before and after the Dr’s Ghadiri took over) and I have no complaints. All my dental work has been excellent, and so have cleanings. If you have sensitive teeth/gums, they are happy to give you a topical beforehand, and note it in your chart for future reference. Have questions? They’ll answer as many as you’ve got and explain as much or little as you’d like. They truly care about your teeth, and you as a person. I always leave here in a better mood than I went in, can’t say enough good things about the people and the care here.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

The office receptionist (Yamila) is welcoming and openly greets each client by name. Smiles and a friendly yet very professional environment provided me the reassurance that this is the Dental service for me! My cleaning was painless and I was provided an ongoing narrative regarding the process. In addition, the Hygenist (Kim) used the latest techniques and equipment available, including actual high definition photographs of my teeth and their condition. Dr. Ghadiri also greeted me warmly as she began to examine my oral hygiene and offered her professional expertise in planning the upgrading of my current fillings. I strongly recommend the Ghadiri Comprehensive Dental Services to anyone, at any age!< /review>

I love this dental practice! They are competent, courteous and professional.  They answer all my questions and I have always followed their advice and been extremely happy with the results.  I might add I've had crowns, night guards, and cavities performed here.   I have a 104 grandmother so I tell them I plan to live a long time and want to keep all my teeth.  So far so good< /text>

< Review>
Dr. Ghadiri and staff were wonderful from the moment I entered the office.  I drive 2 hours to get to the office because of his state of the art chairside manner.  The staff takes time to explain all procedures before starting and there was no pain.
I highly recommend this practice.<//Review>

<text>My co-worker recommended me Ghadiri's office and I am very glad I followed his recommendation. I'm having a great experience with Dr. Ayeh Ghadiri. She has already saved one of my teeth and continue helping to cure the rest. Other staff is also very competent and polite. I am very thankful to them and I definitely recommend this place to everyone.< /text>< Gmap_id>

I am impressed every time I visit with how this practice is run. From the professionalism and friendliness of the front desk to the cleanliness and latest in technology of the entire operation. I have had work done by both doctor Ghadiris and I cannot decide if one is better than the other. Both are as great as one can wish for and make the patient feel extremely comfortable by explaining what is being done at all times. I still come back here although I live 1.5 hours away on a good day with no traffic. I have also had cleanings done by several hygienists and every experience has been wonderful!</text>

Having gotten to know Dr. Amir and Ayeh Ghadiri prior to joining their practice, I was confident that they provided one of, if not, the best dentistry service based on their personality. Dr. Amir has one of the biggest heart I’ve come across in a person and so honored to know him along with Dr. Ayeh who has one of the kindest spirit I’ve come to know. They’ve brought together an amazing team who all have shown they care about providing the best quality care. I get that we are human and have our days, but based on my experience, they’ve not missed a step in putting their best foot forward.</review>

I have been seeing both Drs Ghadiri for over 8 years and I can't tell you how happy I am with every aspect of their professional service.  The office is impeccably clean.  The staff is always welcoming and very knowledgeable about insurances and goes out of their way to help you get the most out of your benefits.  What sets this office apart from most offices is that they care, they all really care about their patients.  It feels like I'm visiting with family every time I go in.  I have had the works done from implants to simple fillings and every experience has been wonderful.</Review>

I love dr. Ghadiri's dental services. I've been a customer many years now, and I can't emphasize enough how great they really are. The staff members are always kind and it's so nice to know that they have very good intentions and always have my well-being in mind when making decisions. I highly recommend Dr. Ghadiri!</Review>

<Text>My experience was extremely timely, proficient, and clear. From the time I entered I knew exactly what was expected of me regarding covid protocols. Hand sanitization, temperature check, clean pen, then place used pen in proper canister, mask on the entire time. Ginger was amazing, and not only is very welcoming, but also very good at what she does, and I noticed she was willing to help any doctor or colleague that asked, with a great attitude. Dr. Ayeh was gentle, empathetic, and communicated honestly, and even showed me what needed to be done. Lastly, the Hygienist Catherina (I believe that is her name). She was also, kind, gentle and so honest in her work. She truly loves what she does, and it shows. I felt at ease, really cared for and I was not rushed at all. I highly recommend this practice.</Text><Rate>5< /Rate><date>1610578910096< /date><resp>{'time': 1610640534374, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your wonderful feedback, Rosanna!

A great dentist, one that I frequently recommend to others.  After having left my previous dentist, I've now seen what I've been missing out on!  They have it all here; from the (new to me) technology, to all of the extremely friendly staff.  Their strict covid protocol is nice to have during these crazy times as well.<//text>

Extremely pleased with this dental practice. Hygienist, dentist and assistant are studied and highly skilled. They also provide advice on best practices to avoid future dental problems.  Front office personnel are attentive to my scheduling needs and accurately compute the insurance/co-pay.  Front office and the dentist have worked together well to prioritize the work that needs to be done so as to maximize my insurance, but not jeopardize my dental heath with improper delays.< /review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>I have been coming to the office for over 13 years now. Both Dr.Ayer and Amir have been such caring dentists not just in what they do daily for their patients. But their expertise and work ethics have given me peace of mind knowing that they have put my best interest first. I have been referring friends, family and colleagues to the office over the year. Everyone came back so pleased with the services and treatments that they have received. Katherina - my hygienist has always been so detailed at what she does. The best part is all of the front desk staff are so pleasant and professional. They make you feel like part of the family. Finding the right and caring dentist is the key to have a healthy and happy smile. I’m so happy and glad that I have found the kind and caring dentists.<//review>< gmap_id>

I went in to get my tooth extracted, it went fine and i paid an industry standard price. I came back for a cleaning. As most have experienced, COVID-19 has been very tough financially especially in the bay area. Ghadiri Comprehensive Density charged me much more than ThEy had estimated. This dentist is a good dentist at an expensive rate</text>

The office & dentist has always been friendly & professional. I have been a patient since the start of the doctors practice & he has worked with me to completed my treatments within my insurance budget year after year preparing me for retirement & loss of insurance. All treatments to replace 30 year old filings, onlays & crowns have been successful & problem free the 1st time.  The cleaning treatments are excellent.  I travel from Santa Cruz to his office in San Jose specifically to continue as a very satisfied patient.<//Review>

Dr. Ayeh and Dr. Amir are absolutely lovely people, and everyone in the office is super friendly. Adina is a great hygenist, very quick and capable. I have always gotten great dental care here. I go for cleanings every 6 months, and have also had fillings done. Could not recommend highly enough.</Text>

<name>Brandon Woods</name><Review>If your looking for a dentist, stop searching right now. Dr Amir Ghadiri is one of a kind. He has a great personality, and really takes the time to make sure you understand everything, and that you are making the right choice with the options available. He never made it feel like I didn't have a choice. Patient comfort and satisfaction are top of his priorities. I can tell he is a true professional, as everyone who was assisting, or watching kept saying "beautiful" or "perfect" when they were there watching the procedure.
He has a very friendly staff, that is just awesome and a real pleasure to see them. I don't know how I lucked out, but I have found a great dentist, and wanted to let others know!< /Review>< rating>

<review>The Ghadiris *and* their staff are some of the most remarkably skilled and delightful people in the business. Several people in my family have some challenging issues with dental maintenance and pain management and there's quite honestly no one else we could imagine going to who would treat us so gently and kindly.< /review>< pics>

< Review>
This facility provides a clean, safe, and professional environment for all to train! I’ve been coming here for almost a year and honestly it has been a great experience for me. The instructors of each class are very informative and really care about your development.

Once you come and do the free 3 day trial, you will definitely want to join!! You won’t regret it.</Review>

I do appreciate what I learn from those gyms but none of them compare to Millennia. I have been training here for a year and they have various skills levels which is nice. They are well organized with their classes.  All three of my kids train here and they love it.  They have grow a lot over the year they been here in their skills, fitness, and confidence. hope this helps anyone who is looking for a good gym to call their home.<//Text>< Pictures>

My 9 year old son was interested in taking a martial arts class so after doing a little research i walked in to Millennia, Maraya and Chris were awesome in answering all my questions. After the first few free classes  i signed my son up and he loves his training! Coach Betiss is a living legend and a true professional, it's an honor to have my son be a part of the Millennia family!</text>

All the instructors are great and are there to help you and not leave you behind. Great place for kids to learn how to defend themselves and have a great time while learning. Many are going throw in there and not just set the standard for the gym that they are highly motivated with their students.<//Text>< pictures>

The coaches actually coach for a living as a full time job most gyms dont have this.. If you want to get ready for a fight or just looking for a hobby they have a class for you!!</Review><Resp>None</Resp>< rate>

Excellent gym that keeps up with the evolution of Martial Arts and fitness. The prices are great too! You can learn MMA, jiu-jitsu, and striking for the same price that most gyms charge for only one art. Been going for 2 years and don't plan to stop!</text>

Best of all, if you’re new to BJJ or Muay Thai, they have fundamental classes that help you understand the basics. You won’t feel lost at Millennia MMA. If you’re more experienced, they’ll meet you where you’re at.<//text>< Pictures>

As a former collegiate wrestler, judoka and tae kwon do practitioner, i seek balance when training in combat sports/martial arts. Millennia blends western sports philosophy and intensity with the traditional eastern martial arts values of respect, discipline, honor, self-reliance, etc which is important to me. Whether you are experienced in combat sports or are looking to step foot into the beautiful world of martial arts for the first time, with Millennia you get great coaches, fighters, teammates, people and vibes all around. Training the mind, body, and spirit is crucial to becoming the best version of yourself🙏 Blessed love 💚💛❤</Review></record>

The instructors here are incredibly passionate about what they do. They manage to be concerned for safety and welfare while still pushing students to improve and challenge themselves. There is a wide variety of classes and times, and it's an appropriateway for beginning, intermediate, and advanced material artists.< /Review>

<Review>Great academy. Millennia is without a doubt the training hub for all the IE. I, personally, have been training there for years and consider the technique I've learned there to be invaluable. Professor Rommie is, without a doubt, one of the most knowledgeable coaches I've ever had in martial arts. But more importantly, the level of care he has for his students is what makes him a great coach.< /Review><name>Carlos Alberto< /name><Rating>5</Rating>< gmapID>

<review>This place is sketchy to say the least. The membership contracts is a scam. they will make u pay an extra month after you have cancelled. you can only cancel if you have a change of address and show proof. It took me way too long to cancel my membership. I've read similar reviews regarding the membership contracts and it is basically the same experience. After you cancel they will bill you for another month. Ultimately they treat some people unfair. save ur hard earn cash and find a place that's more up to date with their pay system. This place also lacs basic equipment. It is not a very clean place. Even for a gym there needs to be some standards and this place needs much improvement in regards to sanitation.<//review>< Pics>

I joined the gym with with my buddies to learn self-defense about a year ago. My Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has progressed so much under Romie, Betiss, and Rick and I really enjoy their conditioning classes, too.
The gym has been super welcoming from day one. And the fighters and higher belts are always willing to help show me techniques.< /Text>

I would see it here and there on TV so I Googled MMA gyms Millennia came up first so I called to try out and the first class I took was wrestling during that time I didn't know how to defend attacks but I kept pressing through and now after years of training the only thing I am afraid of doing is hurting someone severely. Thank you Millennia.</review>< pictures>

Awesome MMA gym and they are not sales-based. You can go here to get in shape, but you will learn practical fighting technique. Staff and patrons are very very positive people looking to help each other out. You can train with and be trained by actual UFC & Bellator fighters here; this really is the real deal. If you are a beginner, it is not a problem because the staff will help you reach your goals and advance at your pace. I highly recommend if you're looking for an authentic experience!<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>My family has trained at Millennia MMA for the last couple of years. My kids take the kid's classes and the trainers are world class and very patient. We left another Martial Arts studio because the techniques they taught, while pretty, wouldn't work in a real fight. The techniques my kids are taught at Millennia would work in a real fight, if, heaven forbid, they found themselves there.  My kids have been instructed by World Champions, UFC Fighters, and Muay Thai Kickboxers that actually lived and trained in Thailand.
My wife takes the cardio kickboxing classes and Muay Thai kickboxing classes and loves it. I've trained in their Jiu jitsu, grappling, MMA, and kickboxing classes. The instructors we've had have all been great, both technically and personality.
The instructors at Millennia compete and that makes a huge difference. They don't teach theory they teach what works.
The gym is big enough that you always have a great variety of training partners and yet the instructors make it a point to know you by name. We've trained alongside UFC, Bellator, and other professional and amateur fighters in the gym. It's a blast to be able to watch your training partners on TV or at a local show on the weekend.
I have and will continue to recommend Millennia to my closest friends.<//Text>< pictures>

I went to get my nails done today and saw that they got new dipping powder with over 300 different colors. The colors are very pretty. The salon is also very clean and the staffs are very nice. I also tried the Hawaii coconut pedicure and I LOVED it! It was very relaxing and I will definitely be coming back and get it again!<//text>

They did such an amazing job on my pedí and dip mani today!  I was in heaven with my massage!!! I’ve been getting pedicures for 20+ years and the massage along with their attention to detail ... spectacular! Plus the place is clean and very much of a modern chic vibe.  👍🏼👍🏼</text>

The staff were very friendly. The shop was clean and the price was good. Very relaxing atmosphere with spa type music. I tried 2 other shops before I found this one and was very disappointed with both of them. Inagar Nail Spa is farther from my home but so worth the drive. I left a wonderful shop where I lived in the LA area and worried I would have a hard time finding a great place here. I'm glad I found this shop.</review>

This is the first time in many years I have had my nails done.  I am very pleased with my visit.  I called and was able to get in within an hour.  The location was clean, friendly and quiet.  Very pleasant. I had dipped nails done and there were so many colors to pick!  The woman who did my nails was great.  It was a great experience and I love my nails.< /Review>

<review>I've been looking for a nail salon in roseville for so long and I have found it !!!  I've gone to so many in the past that say they're really good but the results aren't what I wanted  But this place is amazing. My new nail  set is out of my comfort zone but they nailed what I had in mind.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Today was my first time, ever, visiting Inagar nail salon and I'm so happy about my experience there. I've never had acrylic nails before and this experience has set my expectations very high for any other salon I might visit. I had my nails done by Kate and she was amazing! I will be coming back again, maybe for a pedicure next time, and, bringing friends. 😊</Review>

<review>I love Inagar Nails Spa! I have only tried their pedicures on 4 occasions so far and every time has been better than the last. Most importantly, the spa is spotless and the staff do their best to keep it in pristine condition. The tub liners in the tubs are a great addition and I noticed the staff thoroughly scrubbing the tubs at the end of the night. That's the kind of cleanliness I look for! In terms of the pedicures themselves, I have tried the Hawaiian Coco and the Green Tea ones thus far and both are superior. They use real ingredients in their spa materials such as real edible coconut milk or real green tea, which makes the pedicures feel healthier for my skin to take in. It definitely seems like the staff take pride in the quality of their spa materials and I appreciate that. I will continue to be a regular customer here and hope Inagar maintains its' wonderful service, professionalism, and high standards. Thank you!<//review><GmapID>0x809b21edcf58cbdb:0xaaa2ec9cf2570ff0<//GmapID>< UserId.>

We love coming here, the staff is so friendly and welcoming. My daughter and I come in frequently.  We never feel rushed they take their time,  give extra long massages and the attention to detail is amazing. My daughter always wants specific designs and they always come out perfectly.

<Review>My first time trying this salon.  I came with my two daughters that live in the area.  We foind this salon on yelp.  The salon itself is clean & their products are of good quality. Thyla did an excellent job with my powder dip manicure and I got the basic pedicure.   I will return when I visit again in December.</Review><Date>1559855130455< /Date>< Rating>

Very clean!  Friendly, welcoming service.  QUALITY work.  I will DEFINITELY be back, and if this level of care is consistent I'll become a regular.

Lucy did my mani/pedi.  Fantastic!

Oh...and the convenience to schedule online is also a bonus...< /Review>

First time here and I was very satisfied! Thyla did my acrylic fill and it was amazing. She took her time and fix what the last salon messed up. I can truly appreciate nail salon such as this place. I recently moved to CA from the East Coast and hadn’t found a salon I really enjoyed getting my nails done at. They have a wide variety of Dip Powders and Shelac Gel polish. I’m a definitely a satisfied customer. Thanks Thyla!!</Review>

09/01/18 Still loving this Nails Spa! Went in today for my last summer color nails before I start looking at all the Fall Dipping Powder colors they have. Love this place, just love!

This shop is under new Ownership, and just re-opened as Inagar Nails, about a ten days ago. I went here for the Natural Dipping Powder nails, and they were also doing a special of Dipping Powder nails and a free pedi. I recently started getting Dipping Powder nails and my fav nail tech doesn’t do Dipping Powder nails, so I thought I’d give Inagar Nails a try. So glad I came here. It was quiet , w/ soothing music. The Pedi was nice, and I love the Dipping Powder manicure. I will be back.</Text>

<name>Rich Wales<//name><Text>In spite of being pretty careful about sealing up possible entry points to my house, I heard a scratching sound from a wall in my kitchen a few weeks ago.  These guys came out and quickly identified the problem and found the point of entry, as well as several other possible entry points around the perimeter of my house.  They set traps and gave me an estimate for repair work, which I reviewed with them in detail and then approved.  Work was completed efficiently on time and very professionally. I don't envy these guys their jobs - they work in some pretty nasty conditions. But they were knowledgeable, responsible, very professional, and seemed to genuinely enjoy solving my problem.  I trust that they could deal with almost any residential pest problem.
Their objective is to seal up your property so nothing can get in as opposed to coming to your house to spray it with poison every month. So far so good!<//Text><Rating>5</Rating>< user>

<user_id>113387235611248064840</user_id><Text>Khoa was the employee who handled everything at my home. He was always on time, professional, friendly, well spoken and competent, and willingly to answer any questions I had.
After discovering rat activity I contacted Critter Control for an inspection ($199 for my single story ~1500sf home) to get more information about the problem.  The inspection was very detailed including photographs of all the possible problem areas that needed to be fixed as well as the price to fix each issue.  I contacted Critter control for more information about how the problems would be fixed and why some areas were noted as needing fixing.  The response I got from the Chris was very detailed and answered all of my questions and demonstrated he knew what he was talking about.  I proceeded with having all the repairs done as well as paying for their trapping service ($399 for initial trap setup in both attic and crawlspace, and 3 follow up checks).  Everything was done as promised and pictures were provided to show all of the fixes that were performed.  Due to scheduling, the repairs couldn't be done until the 3rd trap check, so I got an extra trap check for free to ensure nothing was trapped after the repairs had been completed.
Even though the repairs have only been done for a week, I have confidence that should I have any issues Critter Control will stand behind their work and do any necessary follow up.
Originally I had planned on only getting the inspection and doing the repairs and trapping myself, and this is definitely something that you could do if you are comfortable with it - the inspection provides all the details you need to address any issues.  But ultimately I felt Critter Control would do a better job than I would, and that it was worth paying the premium to avoid the hassle myself and have the professionals take care of the issue.  While they may not be the cheap, you do get what you pay for.<//Text><GmapID>0x808fe7e50b49d0d7:0x4940bf8b9347b704< /GmapID><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rating>

This company is very well organized and thorough.  You are assigned one person and that person does all the inspection and follow up.  Steve was very professional and courteous.  The inspection was thorough and they sealed our home from rodents.  It's not inexpensive but we paid half as much a few years ago to have the house rat proofed and it didn't work so we felt the investment was worth it.  I found many good reviews for them online and through Nextdoor before hiring them.  Steve also built custom doors for our crawlspaces which look great.  Nice guys and easy to have around.  I appreciated their hard work and professionalism.</text>

<Time>1609788519955<//Time><Rate>5</Rate><text>Shortly after the weather changed to colder nighttime temperatures we started noticing scratching sounds in the crawl space under our kitchen area. Several weeks later we noticed rodent droppings in the area we feed our dog.  Since there was the possibility it could be opossums, squirrels or raccoons in our crawl space our pest control service recommended Critter Control. Our assigned technician, Steve, was dispatched to perform a thorough inspection which included our crawl space, our attic space, our roof and our foundation. Within 24 hours after the inspection was completed we received a thorough report of issues and suggested resolutions. His primary observation was evidence of roof rats. We scheduled him for setting traps and, a week later, performing the structural repairs. Within a week after setting the traps we captured 4 rats inside and 3 in the crawl space. The mitigation work was performed and during the trap check no additional rats were found. The noises we heard previously also ceased. During the last trap check there was still no evidence of rodents or wildlife. We highly recommend Critter Control, Steve and Angelica for providing excellent customer service and completely resolving our issue in a timely manner.<//text>< pictures>

<text>Critter Control is the epitome of professionalism, expertise, and friendly-service.  I cannot rate them highly enough.  10+ stars if I could.

We have caught four rats under our house and tried to close every opening we could find. David and his teammate Andrew came out and at a glance spotted a half-dozen or more access points we missed because we simply don't know what to look for.  We were fortunate too that they were able to do the repairs during the inspection.  We're so relieved and they gave us info about maintenance and what to watch for so we're equipped to do our own prevention in the future.

We had another service - very highly rated on Yelp - come out and the inspector told us we didn't have any signs of rats, even though we had already caught one, and caught a further three after he left.  That was frustrating.

Critter Control would never let that happen.  Our techs were so conscientious and diligent, they even did a minor patch or two and didn't charge us, because they just want to make their customers happy.  Oh - and they cleaned out a cat skeleton under the house that we knew was there but were too squeamish to go get.  Bleck.

I think their business is going to blow up because they're head and shoulders above the other highly rated company we tried, so call them now while you can still get on their calendar!!</text>< Pictures>

I had Critter Control put a cap on my chimney after an owl got into my house through the fireplace. It took 2 attempts before the right size cap was received, but that was no problem because they kept me informed along the way and always kept their appointments as scheduled or even arrived earlier when possible. I was extremely satisfied with the service provided, and it was a pleasure to have Steve complete the delivery and installation of the chimney cap. I highly recommend Critter Control.</text>

I was having problems with a raccoon getting into my garage and from there into my house. Mike did a thorough inspection of possible ways the raccoon was getting in.. After blocking the most likely, they set traps. We didn’t catch the raccoon, but he didn’t get back in either. I was very impressed with Mike who did the inspection and set the traps. He was extremely knowledgeable and also very nice and the response from Chris in the office was first rate. The service was super easy to schedule and very efficient. They told us EXACTLY when they would be here (no 4 hr windows), and I feel like this service was an excellent value for the price!</review>

<text>We wanted to hire Critter Control of San Jose but couldn't because unfortunately they don't cover our area.

But with no incentive, Chris was still super helpful in explaining how the whole process worked and giving us unbiased advice.

Highly recommend hiring them if you want people who care.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Critter Control is an awesome company and they do the hard work that the other big names Pest Control companies won't do.   For example, they will get in the attic and search out the animals and place traps whereas the big companies will only check as far as they can reach in.   Every time I go away from Critter Control I end up going back to them< /Review>

I called a couple of other places and they all told me that they are scheduled out for over 1 week, or 10 days, or what have you, but Critter Control came out today--the same day I called them--on a Saturday no less. Also, Mike just gave me some good advice and did not even charge me. He showed me what to do and said, "Honestly, if it were me, I would not catch them. I would just seal that hole in your pool shed." Also, he gave me wire mesh to seal the hole and did not charge me. I would highly recommend them.<//Text>< pics>

<review>Khoa did a thorough and careful job with our inspection, working with us on trapping, and repairing possible entry points for our roof rat visitors. He is an exceptionally honest, trustworthy, and good guy who carefully followed all Covid-19 safety protocols. They provide a very professional report of entry points with photos and recommendations and their pricing was fair. Our roofline is steep, and although I wish they could have done more work for us up there, they were honest about insurance restrictions and recommended that we instead hire qualified roofers for that part of the job. Critter Control was recommended to us by another pest control company who is swamped and no longer traveling to our area. After hearing horror stories about other pest control companies, we feel lucky to have been referred to Critter Control and if you choose them, we recommend that you ask for Khoa.</review>< user_name>

Steve, Chris and Team did a great job. There was significant damage from a burst sewer pipe under that house. Yuck! They explained the situation so I was able to take care of it. They also took care of the rodent issues. I was very happy with their professionalism all the way through the process.</Text>

<review>The initial inspection was done by another team member but he had since departed the company, so Steve took over the job. Steve and the team had set clear expectation about the job up front – setting the mouse/rat traps, and repairing various parts of our house to seal off any openings from which mice and rats could enter.

The job involved the total of four visits, with two of them being quick trap checks. They were punctual, polite, and very efficient. We are very happy with how the job went.</review><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_id>

< Review>
My mom's neighbor down the backside of her backyard called and said there was a dead deer starting to smell.  I got the message and started calling around government offices at state and local and discovered they don't remove dead deer on private property.  Luckily through google I found Critter Control.  Chris called back right away, price seemed reasonable to me and he could do it same day.  He was also honest in giving the name of a competitor who is larger company and maybe cheaper.  I appreciated the honesty but never called the other guy.  Deer was removed the same day and I got regular communication on work schedule and progress from Chris.  I am extremely pleased with the service level from Critter Control and give them my highest recommendation.<//Review>

Needed someone to come out to investigate noises in the attic. Read some reviews on Nextdoor and decided to give them a call.  David came out to investigate.  He identified potential entrance points, provided photos, proposed a plan, and set up a live trap to catch the squirrel(s).
A total of three were trapped within a two day period.  After several days of no activity and an empty trap, David and an assistant came to plug up and repair the previously identified potential entrance points.  They were professional, courteous, and efficient in completing the repairs.  The entire team at the San Jose office exceeded my expectations.  Special thanks to Mike who came out to my house twice within four hour time span to remove two trapped squirrels, and set new traps.< /Text>

I called Critter Control because I was having a raccoon problem and needed their assistance.  They were extremely friendly, timely and very professional via phone, email and in person .  I spoke or interacted with at least 4 people from the company and they were all really friendly people and great doing their job.  They did what they said they were going to do, when they said they were going to do it. They were always there on time to pick up any raccoons we got in the traps.  I highly recommend them and will without question call them back if I ever need or have a large animal problem.< /review>

<text>I'm a big DIY fan so I tried DIY rodent control without any success. So I called Critter Control who sent Dave and Andrew. While maintaining social distance, they quickly crawled into places in our house that I try to avoid and set a bunch of traps.

The next day, (at 2:29 a.m. exactly, thanks to our Nest camera) one of their traps caught a rat as it was trying to get into our crawl space. We called the office, who sent Dave and Andrew back to collect not only this rat, but 3 others they caught. They replaced the traps with new ones and will be back next week to see if they get any more rats.

They also gave me a repair quote to patch the entry points, which I will accept, because so far their work looks very good.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQuI0Cqi6bJ9-2cpagUVy3cIGz8WVSU64UbXX-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Chad is calm, down-to-earth and knows what he's doing. We had dual rat and squirrel problems and he managed to talk us through everything and set up traps that solved the problem. I hope we don't need to call him again, but it's good he is there if we need to!</Text>

Excellent service from Steven for a rodent - surveyed the whole property and went into crawl space to lay traps...followed ups few weeks later. Everything he told us played out as expected - would recommend to anyone with an issue. Its not the cheapest but definitely thorough and excellent service<//Text>

We had been living in a rodent nightmare for nearly two years which no other service we that tried fixed. Finally, we contacted Critter Control. They provided us with pictures of the points of entry that the other services didn’t find. Critter Control did the repairs, again gave us “after” photos and we haven’t had any unwanted critters since they did. The office staff is also polite and professional.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>Responsive, friendly and very helpful.  We were having some rodent activity in our crawl space, and Critter Control helped to lay traps + double check all areas were properly sealed so that no future access can take place.  Haven't had any rodent activity since, so fingers crossed it stays this way.  Thanks Critter Control<//text>< Name>

<Review>These guys are awesome!! They caught a pesky rat that woke me up everyday for weeks in the early hours scurrying around in my attic. I’m finally sleeping soundly again with no more critters. Yay!  Their entire team (Luis, Chris, Dave, Steve, and Jake) were amazing!  They are friendly, knowledgeable and have a great work ethic.  They repaired every potential entry point around the outside of my house and went above and beyond their expected work responsibilities to ensure that my house is a safe haven again. Don’t hesitate in calling the Critter Control of San Jose!</Review>< Date>

Critter Control -Robert- is very professional and he took his time to identify the entry points and close all of them. In addition he installed traps in all in all the levels. He came back multiple time to check the traps and to make sure the job is completed. Robert was easy to work with, he came on time and he finished the job as agreed up.
I highly recommend Critter control.<//text>

Had squirrels living in my attic for over 3 months. Original company hired was an absolute disaster. After which I was referred to Critter Control of San Jose. From the very phone call I experienced absolute professionalism, honesty and extremely informative. Not to mention dependable and pleasant! Robert is amazing. He really knows his stuff.
I now have vast knowledge on squirrels thanks to him.  Last but not least as an animal lover his compassion is was very comforting.< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Last year Jake removed a possum from my crawlspace and plugged the holes.  This year he rat-proofed my attic and plugged the hole.  Everything he did was professional and punctual.  When he did the crawl space last year, he crawled into the tightest space imaginable to trap the possum and replace a vent.  This year, under warranty, he made numerous trips to my attic to get rid of a rat who repeatedly tripped the traps and ate the bait.  Jake was always polite and easy to deal with.  I hope I never need CC of SJ services again, but that's only because I don't want any more critters over or under my house!</text>< Pictures>

Robert came to my home several times to help eliminate a rat situation in the crawlspace. He was prompt - even early, with a call to make sure we were home - and was patient with my questions. He photographed the areas where the rats were gaining access, explained everything, then returned and completed the repairs. He also fit in an unscheduled visit to remove some trapped rats, rather than making me wait. While I hope not to need them, I would happily use Critter Control again in the future.</Review>

< Review>
Critter Control provided a full-service experience, not only trapping our uninvited rodent, but locating and making repairs to insure no more entered into the house.  I was impressed by their ability to identify the problem based on the signs different animals leave and their patterns of activity.  It was expensive, but worth the peace of mind that it was a job well-done that could have cost more down the road.< /Review>

We had a rat problem and Rob came out for inspection and later did repairs. They charge upfront for the very 1st inspection, but it is worth because I saw many companies came out with free inspection and dump out a huge repair statement, which is nonsense. How can they give out a repair statement without detailed inspection? Critter Control was honest and fair. After repair, we haven't had any rat problem.< /Text>

<Review>I traded in my Hypermotard for a new RSV4 RR yesterday.  Reanna, Paul, Chris, and Rafa all made sure I had the smoothest experience upgrading motorcycles.    This is THE dealer for European enthusiast bikes.  If you're looking to upgrade, they have some deals that are hard to pass up.

Definite perk that there are plenty of delicious places to grab lunch while you wait for your bike to get prepped.< /Review>< Pictures>

I sold my bike here. The sales guy is a charm. The service manager is condescending to say the least. The owner seems like a straight up guy, but in the end he's more interested in saving a hundred bucks than making you as a customer feel good. I feel really bad about selling my bike here and I'll tell you why.

I had to sell my bike due to moving out of state. I was offered a price after inspection and repairs which I felt was fair.

They had the bike for 3 weeks for inspection/repair so they had plenty of time to give me a fair quote.

The day I came with the title they said they don't want my bike anymore. But to be "fair" they gave me a new, way lower offer to "take the bike off my hands, or you can just sell it on your own".

After arguing and bickering for 2 hours they finally "agreed" to buy my bike for a lower offer than my original quote. Being desperate not to have to drag this problem as I was moving a couple days later I agreed.

Now why the bad review, expect the obvious above. The reasoning behind the low ball offer was that they had "missed" that the bike had a bad tires, and other things they "needed" to address before being able to sell it. Having it for 3 weeks to make an offer and they missed it, but the day I was there they managed to find all the problems in no time.

Also selling it via consignment they "could not offer it before I put in the money to address these security risks". So that did not make sense.

In the end what happened? They are selling it for $3500 more (minus repairs, no problem with that), and it still has the original bad tire and the other items that needed to be addressed.

Now you know how that makes me feel? Really bad about selling my bike here. Before this ordeal I always loved coming here for my bike needs as I felt it was a cool place with cool people. But this was not cool.

To GP: happy to have the conversation again if you want to have customer satisfaction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: After GPs response to the review

The bike was there for 3 weeks. The same day I brought it in I gave consent to repair the bike. Your sales man would call me later regarding a offer after they knew what needed to be repaired. As he could not give me an offer on the spot as he did not know what the bike needed. So again, you had plenty of time to inspect it.

The reason it was there for 3 weeks was because it took 2 weeks to get a repair quote and offer for the bike because you said you were short on service people due to COVID.  So it only took me 1 week to actually bring in the title after receiving the offer.

Clearly you guys are full of excuses instead of reason, which is why you get the bad review.

And I did like the owner and the sales guy. If I would base my review on that, you would get 5 stars. But you get a bad review because you did not keep your word and dragged it out so I lost money.

It was the service department that took 2 weeks and 2 phone calls to give me a quote for a repair. So if he's mad at me for that, well again then you see what a great attitude you show customers. So again, excuses.

And lastly, the reason I wrote a review in the first place is not all of this. It is because you told me I had to replace the front tire and that is why you low balled my bike. That it was a "safety hazard". Here I go and inspect my bike I sold to you and guess what? The tire is still there. So either you lied or you only care about these "safety hazards" when you can drag the price down. You are untrustworthy.<//Text>

{'time': 1620088358958, 'text': "So the bike was brought in for service and Johnny asked at that time what we would offer as a purchase the sales guy gave an general estimate and did not inspect the bike, Johnny did not pursue the offer further and the bike was left in service for repairs, however he would not agree to fix the bike with the service department.\nRoughly a month later he showed up late day on a Saturday and said he was selling us the bike for X amount and was moving in the next few days, the offer from a month ago was no longer valid and the bike needed more work that was previously suggested, it had a leaking radiator that was in need of replacement, it was due for service and had a bald rear tire as well as being filthy, we made him an offer and gave him other options, like repairing the bike and sending it to him / consignment etc,. he finally agreed to sell us the bike and we all went home late.\nWe have since then done $1700 worth of work on the bike and it is for sale, i'm not sure how he believes we did not fix the problems the bike had before listing it for sale.\nAs for the service guy possibly having an attitude the bike was left in service for a month and he never actually did any work. so i'm sure they felt used, we are all human. Johnny says i was nice to him then left a bad review not sure what more we could have done but treat him fairly as we did. Paul GP"}< /response>

Overall an exceptional experience. They have a great selection, their sales team is very consultative, the finance/deal-processing gal is efficient and responsive. Also, as part of my purchase (which I got a fantastic deal), I had some stock equipment upgraded. So my experience with Parts and Service was also a very positive one. They run a good shop here and you can tell that they care about their customers. Location is convenient (right off the highway). Highly recommend and I'll be going back to them for servicing and whenever it's time for my next bike.</Text>

AMAZING!
I'm military stationed in Germany and decided to buy a motorcycle and ship it over here, Paul and his team were extremely helpful and patient with helping me figure out how'd we'll make this work.
Couple months later I'm sitting on a bike bought across the world trough phone calls and emails
Thank you!</review>

<Text>Bought a used multistrada 1100s in 2014, staff has been helpful and supportive all along the way, sales parts and service. Thats good. Bought the bike with 14k miles and have put 45k miles on it. It has had no shortage of issues. Now that I'm trying trade in the dealer is saying it's true milage is unknown.

< Review>
Employees like Bryan Everidge and Hugo are the reason I will come back here for anything I need in SoCal. In addition to helping me identify the parts I needed, they lent me tools and spent 15+ minutes outside helping me install them. I really appreciate the top-notch service.</Review>

<text>Still my shop of choice after 10+ years of travelling for half the year and experiencing many dealerships. If you ride a Ducati or KTM and you live within 100 miles you shouldn't go anywhere else for service. Parts counter is always super helpful and knowledgeable, Joe is the man!< /text>< pictures>

<text>This dealership is very famous among my friends since they bought their first motorcycles while they were stationed in SD decades ago. For sure same quality of service and sales still go on. In My recent visit, they services my KTM 1290 SAS and I could not get any better service. Todd and Ben are above and beyond. Thank you very much gentlemen..< /text>< Pics>

I purchased a Moto Guzzi v7 in July. I live in Washington state and had never bought a vehicle from a different state but the people from GP were super helpful on informing me about how to do it. I ended up flying to San Diego and riding back to Tacoma, Washington. When I look into buying another bike I'll for sure look at GP motorcycles!</text>

<Review>My first bike and 3rd bike were purchased here. I've always been impressed with the friendliness of the staff.  They are fair and willing to get you a good deal. Their shop is a little pricey but they do great work and you get a discount if you purchased your bike through them... So many bikes and I can't have them all.  I'm really happy with my Guzzi though.< /Review>< Pictures>

Bought my second bike here and they have an extremely professional team. There were a few inescapable issues with getting the bike delivered and assembled but they worked through them vigorously and kept me updated every step of the way. I still go back here for all bike servicing and I would highly recommend them<//Review>

<Review>I'm not sure how but GP had the ability to sell me my new 2017 Moto Guzzi California to me cheaper than any other dealer in the country. Including shipping to Ohio, I would have had to pay A LOT more from the next lowest dealer in the US. Paul forgot to put my free t-shirt in the saddlebags but once I contacted him it was in the mail. Paul was very responsive and easy to deal with. I'll be back.< /Review></record>

I'm a North County SD resident and GP Motorcycles is my go to shop. They are the best shop around, period. I've got a lot of options in Escondido, Temecula etc. It is totally worth the extra couple of minutes to get friendly, knowledgeable 'Top Level Service' at GP Motorcycles. GP's shop is super cool, you have to go see it. GP has a great vibe, and they know Dirt bikes - I've bought 2 KTM's from Paul, a 2019 XC-W 300 tpi for off-road, and an SX-F 350 for MX. I will be buying a 2021 300 this fall when available from GP as well. Joe and Hugo are awesome in service, they always provide great help and advice, you can tell they love what they do and that's why I continue to buy motos from GP Motorcycles!</Review>

I bought a new Moto Guzzi California Touring from Paul at GP on June 6, 2020. I think Paul is the owner and while his staff were not always very responsive, he himself was a pleasure to deal with. Overall, I had a good purchase experience. However, 3 weeks later, on June 27, 2020, I discovered that one of the eagle wings on the tank was missing a tab that would ensure it was tightly adhered to the tank. See picture below. I reached out to Paul on the same day via email and asked for his help in getting this defect repaired. I did NOT hear back from Paul and on July 1, 2020, called him. On the tel, he promised me that he would look into a replacement part even though I had not noticed the defect when I took possession of the bike on June 3, 2020. As a follow-up, I sent him the attached picture via email. Between Jul 1, 2020 and July 10, 2020, I did not hear back from Paul so on July 10, 2020, I sent Paul another follow-up email. Today is Aug 4, 2020 and I have still not heard back from him.  After my initial dealings with Paul, I had hoped to have found a dealer that I could refer friends to and also return to myself for future motorcycle purchases. For me, it's valuable to feel that I could build a long-term relationship with a business. But now, in light of my less than satisfying experiences with Paul post-sale, I don't think GP moto is the place for me.<//review>

<Time>1511201784137<//Time><review>I had the pleasure of working with Chris Curnen from GP Motorcycles for the purchase of my dream bike. I am from KY and was moving to CA soon and needed to be able to purchase a motorcycle in advance. GP Motorcycles was more than willing to accommodate. I put a down payment on the bike a month in advance before picking it up. They held the bike for me and were flexible on the payment options. I also realized that I would have storage issues when riding the bike up to SF so I worked with Chris to have a top case shipped to GP. The team at GP mounted and installed my top case for a reasonable fee and made sure I had everything needed to complete my 3 day motorcycle trip. On top of that they also handled getting the bike registered and titled correctly for me. Thus when I got home I had a fresh new title and plates that were good for the next year. The bike is running amazing and its all thanks to Chris and the team at GP for doing an amazing job. I would highly recommend them to any one</review>< Rate>

Hands down the best motorcycle dealership in SoCal, and having shopped and bought bikes all across the country, I'd say one of the best in the US. I believe they rep Ducati, Moto Guzzi, KTM, Ural, Aprilia, and MV Agusta. Might have missed one, not sure. Tons of expertise, loads of models on the floor and avail to test ride. Attentive, but not pushy, knowledgeable, access to great financing, etc. Particular shout out to Joe who runs accessories - the best in the business at knowing what you need and what you don't...what looks good, what works well, and what does both.

GP is what all Moto dealerships should  be like, but few are.< /Text>

Knowledgeable and honest staff. They are there to do right by the customer which is important. You can buy a bike anywhere, but what is your relationship going to be like with the shop for the duration of time you own the bike? You will need service and perhaps guidance on parts. GP gives you great discounts on parts and service if you buy your bike there. They also have a great selection of bikes and gear.< /Review>

Had a great experience, initially spoke with Paul, once on-site met with Rafael who let me get hands on with the specific bike I was interested in checking out - a DUCATI MULTISTRADA 1260 S.  At 5'6 the bikes seat height was too tall for me (34 inch for reference) sticker price was pretty high though it was a TOURING edition.  Rafael was great though and let me take my time in the show room checking things out, landed on a DUCATI MONSTER which is much lower to the ground and felt right as a small straight forward (but powerful) bike.  Downside is it's a different class and type, not meant for longer rides or any off road action so had to move on.  Rafael expanded my search by helping navigate to some other options, even ones that they did not sell themselves, which I truly appreciated from a service standpoint of caring about what the right fit for a customer is.  He led me to a TRIUMPH 1200 which had a good height for me.  In letting me take my time he followed up as I was exiting to see if I had any last questions and also gave me the address for the closest triumph shop in-case i wanted to do a demo.  Would recommend GP MOTORCYCLES and encourage you to ask for RAFAEL if you're in the market for a new bike.  Knowledgeable, understanding, patient, considerate, helpful, and has the customers best interest at heart.<//Text>

<Text>Bought a motorcycle from GP Motorcycles. Best deal I ever made and I've bought dozens of bikes in my time. I expected to have to wait weeks because the bike was coming to Solvang from San Diego but it was here in four days from the time I first contacted them about the bike. They are now my go to dealer for anything motorcycle related.
Thanks to Paul for the sales end and Chris for the delivery. Much appreciated.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>super attentive to their customers when you’re in store and awesome for test driving before you buy. Only reason I gave 3 instead of 5 is because I called in about a bike I was interested in but never heard anything back after my information was taken down. I was told I’d get a call back with some info and have yet to hear anything almost 2weeks later.< /text>< response>

<Review>I found a motorcycle I wanted when browsing CycleTrader. It was in California and I was in Texas, but I tool a chance and emailed GP Motorcycles.

I'm super happy I did! I got my bike at a great price and had amazing customer service from the owner Paul (and others). They were very patient while my credit union was being a little difficult.

My first time buying a bike from a dealer out of state, but they made the shipping painless. Everything has handled workout a hitch.

I can't recommend GP Motorcycles enough.</Review>< Pictures>

I drove by for years and never stopped . A few years ago I started going in to window shop.   They expanded the place and they got a good selection of beautiful motorcycles. Today I bought a helmet.  Super happy with the helmet the price and the people. GP motorcycles has down to Earth good people.</review>

<Review>The team at GP are fantastic. They carry the best bikes and aftermarket brands, but more importantly these guys really know them inside and out.

I regret having bought my bike somewhere else but will for sure be buying all the aftermarket parts, service needs and my next bikes here.
Paul seems to really care about his customers a value he has clearly instilled in his service and sales teams.

I had the opportunity to watch an old friend of mine trade in a bike and buy an Aprilla RSV4 from Chris. Chris took excellent care of him through the transaction. During this engagement I was able to work with the service team and immediately felt comfortable with the service team’s obvious skill and scheduled my bikes first service here.< /Review>< Pics>

It also means they stock parts that are right for real life repairs, not just a bunch of catalogued shinny BS that wont put you back on the road (or back in the race!). Nothing but great experiences with them since the first time I walked through the door.<//review>< pics>

The sales crew are level headed and helpful every step of the way.

The parts associates are knowledgeable not only about what they carry, but what everyone else has (and why the carry what they do).

The service department is fast and clean. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait for an appointment so make sure to schedule one early (longer wait times in summer)

The selection is great as well. They keep their website up to date so it's easy to see the bikes they have. My only gripe is that their parts can't be viewed online. Now a lot of bike shops don't offer that, so I can't really complain, but I'm waiting for the day to be able to look over their parts online.

Overall I got my bike there, I get my parts there, and I get my service done there. I wouldn't go anywhere else; it's really a great place.<//review>< Time>

I was looking at new and used bikes. Sales staff here were very nice. In the end the bikes were to tall for me feel comfortable to own, but if the right bone comes along I would feel comfortable buying from this dealer.</Text>

Chris, Paul, and Hugo, and Joe are great knowledgeable people when it comes to anything Italian, as well as any other bike. Very friendly atmosphere always willing to help you get what you're looking for. As for the service dept. Nick, what can I say, great guy. Makes you feel like family and always will help you figure out what's wrong with your bike, what can he do to fix it, and how much time it will take. very fast at getting things done HOWEVER, they have a high volume of work to do so make sure you book ASAP! that just shows the great quality of work they do since almost all of San Diego goes to that shop for repairs and/or servicing. I love GP Motorcycles always go there for whatever I need for my bike.</review>

<review>Pretty decent selection, and the owner seems nice. that's why you get 2 stars instead of 1, I ordered a part and it took longer than expected because holiday which is fine, they said it would be in today, I called they said they have a bunch of unopened boxes from the dealer, one of which is probably my part, and that they would get to eventually when they had time, I went down to the store to see if I could expedite the process or something as I really was pressed for time. I walked in to see them all lounging around the store nobody was preoccupied yet the boxes remained closed, I work 13 days straight at a time so I really needed this to be here as this is my only day off, I now have to pay another 250$ for motorcycle storage until I have another day off because you couldn't be bothered enough to open some boxes to find a part that only cost me 60$ I will not be ordering parts through you ever again, I'm really sorry I had this experience with you especially after I just spent over 4 grand cash with you guys.

<review>One year after purchasing my Ducati Monster 821 and I can honestly I have never looked back. Aside from the my bike being an  absolutely beauty, everyone at this dealer seriously knows their stuff. Everything from sales to parts to service is worthy of a 5 star rating​. Will be going back for all my future motorcycle related purchases.< /review></record>

I've only heard good things about this dealership from my father in law. And what do you know? They are AMAZING! Took my trade in for almost double what other shops around town had offered me! Picked up a KTM 1290 SA, AND LOVE IT!  I live in Poway and have a KTM dealership 1min from my house...but I'd drive an hour + for theses guys! Definitely my go2spot !< /Review>

< review>
GP Motorcycles is first-rate. I just purchased a 2017 Aprilia RSV4 RR from the dealership, and my experience from start to finish was hassle-free and of the highest customer service. After reaching out via email, Paul quickly replied offering further assistance. I then called the dealership and linked up with Chris Curnen, the Sales Manager. After getting a brief history on the motorcycle's previous ownership and usage, I made an offer to an already extremely reasonable starting price and we had ourselves a deal. While at the dealership, Chris patiently answered all of my questions and provided complete transparency throughout the process. I completed the purchase today and worked with Raeanna in financing to sign all of the documents. No fuss, no hassle, in and out of financing in less than 15 minutes. Chris took the time to go over the motorcycle with me, threw in a free Aprilia t-shirt, and even helped load the motorcycle onto a trailer (I came down from Los Angeles to specifically work with GP Motorcycles - they're worth it). After safe transport home, I took out the Aprilia for a first-ride and wow, what a machine. To Paul, Chris, Raeanna, and all of the staff at GP Motorcycles, my sincerest thanks. You guys bring great credit to the motorcycling community and provide us with fantastic service. If you're in the market for a motorcycle, I highly recommend GP Motorcycles. Their showroom floor is enough to go and spend a few hours marveling at such beautiful works of engineering and design. Looking forward to future track days with you all!</review>

Truly one of the best shops, if not the best shops in the country. Enthusiast owned and run. Friendly people who'll chat you about any bike you might have in mind. No pressure. And they've always got something interesting on their floor. Have a look.</Text>

<Review>I can't say enough good things about Paul and the crew at GP Cycles. Friendly, courteous, and respectful which is lost art these days. You can buy a motorcycle anywhere, but if your a serious buyer, I recommend giving GP Cycles a call. They've earned my business twice in the last year and that saying a lot!<//Review>< Pictures>

These guys ROCK!!  My husband made several trips to GP Motorcycles to discuss several different bikes.  Each sales person was exceptional in their knowledge and seemed pretty patient with all the hubbies questions and my safety questions.  When it was time to pull the plug, Paul had the only 2015 Hypermotard SP in the SD area!!  He gave my husband a fair price on the bike and a good deal on accessories.  Over all the experience was 5 stars!!  I wish buying a car was this pleasant.  Thanks GP!!  You guys Rock!!

I had an awesome purchase and selling experience here for Aprilia bikes (Josh and Paul). Customer service makes you feel like you're one of the guys and service rocks. I've sent family to buy here, and they felt the same way. Price are reasonable and straightforward, and they stand behind their products.<//Review>

I've been a customer of GP since 2007 and bought a Husqvarna TE450 from them in 2009. I go in there 4 or 5 times a year typically for parts or to drool over some new bike and I have always received personalized attention. The sales, parts, and repair are friendly, competent, and helpful.<//review>

Sale side is great, not so great once the bike is yours. Service side are like Chinese repair men, bring it in for one problem and leave with another. Never fails every time.</Text>

I took my ducati for a diagnostic and they told me the prob. The fixed it and still had the same issues, took it back and said that could get better if we do this, then I said, what if is still the same after that, they said, there’s no other thing to do other than the valves, then I said ok then how much would that be, and said like $800, when they already charged me for the same issue, I said; but this is what I brought here for, you diagnosed it and said this is it and now you say something else and want to charge me more!
Come on guys, I really don’t know how they have a lot of work, they suck! They fixed my bike twice and still has the same or even worst issues.
I’m VERY disappointed it.</Text>

Maybe six weeks ago Chris gave me a great deal on a sweet 1999 Red ST4 and it’s essentially exactly what he claimed it was. They made me feel welcome, I enjoyed the conversation with the other employees, and when I was ready to purchase the bike three days after coming in to check it out Chris actually gave me a very slightly better deal on it than we agreed because he discovered the registration could be transferred and is cheaper than new or something? SO COOL OF HIM. He also walked me out, gave me a T-Shirt, got the tire pressure perfect, and it all took less than 45 minutes. That’s what up Chris. You’re the freakin man. The horn on this bike is broken, which was known and made clear to me and discussed upon sale that it would be fixed. I plan soon to do my first service at their service shop next door and I have zero doubt that he will not fix the horn for me, I simply forgot to ask when I left and haven’t requested it be fixed yet. The only thing that is wrong with the bike that was unknown is that the ‘trip odometer’ does not work, but the actual important one that reads overall mileage does and is accurate. I doubt he knew, how could you? And also it only stops working after 10 miles, so they probably did check it but didn’t ride more than ten miles? Why would they? This is an excellent place to purchase a Ducati and Chris you’re THE MAN and I know you meant it when you said ‘ride safe’ when I left, but dang that front tire powers up smoooooooth in 1st gear mate (:

I have gotten SO many compliments on the bike. And my girl loves it. Life has been sweet since I walked out of GP with Bella the 1999 ST4

I’m pretty sure they have another one and it’s cheap you should def buy it. I might even buy it lol.

Cheers Chris hope your manager sees this and knows you didn’t ask for this and that you are the best.</Text><time>1533567796925</time>< Rating>

<Review>So I live in Florida, I know we get it, the jokes on us.  I inquired about a motorcycle, and talked with Paul.  I called multiple times and was clear about my intentions over a three (3) day period.  Nevertheless, instead of Paul telling me or even mentioning, " hey I got a guy or gal just as interested in the bike as you, can we make a deal today" and on the day I told him I would call back for the 4th time, he sold the bike the morning I called.  Not one bit of notification or anything in between.

We all know sales people are there to sell nothing in between, but where in the world is customer service, clearly unavailable.  Paul had told me how great the dealership was in San Diego.  I told him a story about how I was recently deceived by another Aprilia dealership near where I live, just a month ago.  Now it is painfully obvious why Aprilia has such a bad rap, especially about dealerships.  It is not the bikes as we all know they are brilliant with quirks, it is the clear and utter lack of respect for the customer.  This is the second time I have been mislead and deceived by an Aprilia Salesman.  I now have a bad taste in my mouth and cannot see myself buying my dream bike, as the koolaid you drink only leads to one place.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I think very highly of the operation they have going on over at GP Motorcycles. I purchased a preowned Multistrada from them last weekend.  The process was very transparent and I received above average customer service from Rihanna, Josh, Chris, and Paul. I've never bought anything from a dealership before, but I'd buy from GP again.</Review>

<Review>I would most definitely not purchase another vehicle from GP Motorcycles in the future.  While my salesperson was "polite" enough during the transaction, he did not bother to continue his conversation w/ my wife when I would step away on numerous occasions.  Furthermore, when I returned to pick up a gift card a few days later, he got up from his desk, walked to the back to get the card and tossed it onto the desk and proceeded with his business.  I thought ok maybe he's busy.  That was a month ago.  I returned today and not a word in my direction and I was standing in front of his desk.  I guess you have to be buying something to get a simple hello.  I plan on using the gift certificate to purchase merchandise however go elsewhere for all my service and maintenance.< /Review>< gmapID>

<text>terrible experience. They wouldn't let me test drive the bike that I was there to purchase the FZ09. I called about the FZ09. I came down specifically to look at the FZ09. I had the cash to purchase the FZ09 in my pocket. They said they don't let people test ride them until they are ready to buy. I don't know how much more ready I could have been. The sales person and owner stated I could return the bike if I didn't like it.  It was because they were closing and nobody wanted to stick around so I could ride it for 5 minutes. I did call ahead and ask if it's ok I'm coming so late. They told me it was no problem I was coming at 5:30 and they close at 6:00. I made sure this return was part of the agreement because I know how hard returns can be at Dealerships. I rode the bike but after everybody had left.  Itwas clanking around and the engine sounded like it was gonna blow up.  The next morning right when they opened I called to set up a return. The owner quickly got on the phone and was super rude and argumentative. He was trying to tell me that I had the bike for days. He also said that was the deal we made last night and it doesn't apply to today. I only had the bike for less than 12 hours. Once I arrived at the dealership the owner started to be nice but then quickly started with his antics again. He sent the parts guy out to drive it and tell me nothing's wrong with it. All was a complete waste of time because at this point the dealership lost my trust. I'm not spending 6000$ somewhere that is untrustworthy.They ended up refunding me in the end but the whole time the owner was making antagonizing comments like "there's nothing wrong with the bike, I guess it's not the bike for you huh?" When I didn't answer he kept saying "huh,huh" he was talking to me like I was an idiot and I was wrong about everything.  I kept my mouth shut because I just wanted my money back. He didn't even help me get my money back. He passed me off to a salesperson that was helping 2 other people. They literally wanted me to have the worst experience they could muster up.  Stay Away they don't care after you buy the bike they will hang you out to dry.

Edit: I bought an FZ09 same year from a private seller and guess what? The bike runs exactly how I expected and has 0 issues that this dealerships bike had. What a surprise they weren't honest about anything. Be warned.< /text><username>Anthony and Zeus<//username><Pics>None</Pics></record>

<Text>GP Motorcycles is simply awesome. I've been riding for 34 years, and bought and sold more motorcycles than I can remember. Dealership experiences are something I've learned to DREAD, nay, HATE. They all seem to have the same high pressure jerks working the sales floor and the same "I don't give a rats ass" finance guys who try to get you to buy a warranty for your insurance for your warranty for your valve stem caps for the low low price of $1,000 per day.

GP Motorcycles is NOT that way and NOT that kind of dealership. The MICHAEL LYNCH was friendly and personable. Once I told him what bike I was interested in, he wanted to know more about me, and why I wanted THAT particular bike. He wanted to make sure I was making a good decision. A quick test ride, a wee' bit of haggling over the price and a deal is struck. While we're waiting for paperwork, insurance documentation and all that, my GF offers to show their salespeople some Microsoft Excel tricks/tips, and the let her. They also keep her engaged in conversation while Michael and I are doing paperwork and such.

In the end, not only did I get a good deal on the Motorcycle I wanted, they included a deal on an unlimited mileage multi-year extended warranty for LESS than half of what other dealers have tried to charge for 1 year/12,000 mile warranties. They included free t-shirts for me and my GF and a KTM Coffee Cup. ON top of all that Michael dug around in the back room and found a GARMIN GPS that fit the mount on that motorcycle as a huge bonus.

ON TOP of all that, they gave the motorcycle a once-over since I was going to be riding it from San Diego to LA.

While waiting for the once-over service, they recommended we go up the street to a GREAT restaurant (and it was an awesome recommendation). Before we even finished lunch, they had the bike done.

Upon returning to the dealership, they greeted us by name and made sure we were both happy before letting us go.

I've honestly never dealt with a dealership this personably, and customer focused. They earned my repeat business and my only EVER 5 star recommendation for a Motorcycle dealership.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Thank you Joe in parts for all your excellent information on helmets and the Sena brand and models gloves jackets and armor. I'll defiantly be back to get at least a few of them at a time. Take care and thanks again. Mike and Chris and Paul thank you for your kind hospitality. Your shop really shows well. I never thought I would want a Ducati but after seeing the Diavel S you've got me interested. I still need to ride the Moto Guzzi MGX-21soon. Thank you all.< /Review>

This place is always busy. They're  good though. They've always took care of me. And without feeling gouged. It's a friendly place to visit.<//review>

<Text>This place was terrible as far as providing customer service, self centered employee.
I went there because they are a wish.com distributor. When i arrived they had multiple signs saying open now today. And for cell phone repair they were. When i went inside an employee came out asked me what i was there for.  I told her i needed to get an order that had come in Saturday, 2 days ago. She bruskly said no wish today. When i called to see if they were open they said yes. I asked her why they didn't say they weren't doing wish.com today when i called? I told her i had to spend 7$ to get there and i had to go home with nothing, and come back another day. I said don't you think this is bad customer service? She asked me to leave as an answer....... Do you call this customer service? I don't.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCXg6d15F94jnZU-mgHJ7uI2ApreMwETJkplRH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkVPJ0EVxXPUBLoFliQyC8RyDqKg36BhTGbAe2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVwXDevB_H0iw3TdLyNE9MMA8kI8KLZruGECgb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

I talked to Erica over the phone regarding my Samsung Galaxy S10+ in the morning. Without hesitation, she quoted me a great price for replacing the front screen and digitizer and have it back to me within a couple of hours. Whereas turn around for other cell repair service was a week before I would get it back with outrageous pricing.

Sure enough, Erica came through and I have my cellphone looking and working like new. Thank you Cell Spot!!!< /Text>

<Text>Had a repair for a oneplus and a samsung s10+, it's cheaper than getting serviced from the companies and other nearby competing stores. Pro tip tho, bring cash because there's a 5% surcharge for credit and debit, they always forget to mention that and I got burned once. You might have to wait a while for their diagnostics tho, it takes between 1-4 days depending on how busy they are and for phone models that are less common, they have to order the screens ahead of time, so call ahead.< /Text><Time>1620106747454<//Time>< name>

Best place to repair any product. Your welcomed by the owner most of the time.  They do a satisfying job,  if not.. there is warranty until job corrected. Prices are reasonable. Most work done in a couple of hours. I'm always extremely satisfied.  ONE HAPPY CUSTOMER 😁</text>

Great place to get your phone repaired. Friendly staff, very knowledgeable. All other places didn't have the replacement screen for my galaxy s10+ but this place had it in stock and did a quick and flawless installation. I hope to never break another phone but if it ever happens again I'll make sure to be back! A++ service. Thank you Ericka!< /Review>

Came in around 430pm to have the cracked front and back glass of my galaxy S10 replaced and got it back at about 7pm, later that day. Not bad. Wasn't cheap though, cost me $308, including tax. OUCH! Lower cost repair shops wanted the phone over night, which wasn't an option for me.< /review>

I bought a so called oem screen for my iPhone last month and it doesn’t work because the screen darkens when my hand is around the sensor on top of phone and I explain that the screen is defective and she wouldn’t honor 6 month policy.   She claims that this is normal which is a lie because my old iPhone screen never did that.I don’t believe the screen is an original iPhone screen as she claims. I would steer away from this place because they don’t honor their 6 month warranty and more than likely don’t use original iPhone screens!<//text>

I took my hubby’s old iPhone 8 to this store, thinking the lightning port needed to be replaced, due to no connection to the lightning cable. To my surprise, it took one minute to get it fixed, for free. It end up being dust build up inside the port. Thank you for being honest about it. I will recommend this place to all my friends.</text>

<text>INCREDIBLE SERVICE!!! Cynthia and Erica are simply the best out there! I found them through Yelp and boy did they earn my 5 star review!

After about a week of my iPhone 6 touch screen not working, I finally decided to try and get it fixed. I brought it in and explained what was going on with my iPhone and they said 'No problem, we'll have it fixed within 20 minutes'. I thought to myself there's no way they will have it done in 20 minutes. And I was right because they had my phone working within 15 minutes! I can't believe how fast it was!

These two worked incredibly hard to get me in and out as fast as possible and that's something I greatly appreciate. My time is very valuable to me and it definitely seems like they took that into consideration.

Thanks again Erica and Cynthia! You two rock! 😎👍🏼< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Found this place online.
Erica and Cynthia are the most honest people out there. Great prices. I brought my phone in thinking it was a cracked screen but it was just the tempered glass. (What a relief). I appreciate the honesty. They could've taken my phone and I would have never known it was the tempered glass. Thank you. You saved me some money</review>

<review>At first, I came in with a phone that had an unresponsive screen and the lady (not Jackie) told me it needed a screen replacement. So I got the screen replacement once and then it broke when I pressed down so they did a second screen and it was still unresponsive, so the problem ended up being the motherboard and a chip had burned. I just believe that they should’ve done a better job at finding the problem because I think the new screen was unnecessary and it took 2 days to fix. However I give Jackie 5 stars for customer support because she took her time to drive from Anaheim to Walnut to take my phone to me. THANK YOU JACKIE she really deserves recognition for her customer support and even a raise!</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Text>Great experience!
I took my phone here because the glass was bulging after I dropped it. Another place quoted me $200 over the phone and said they probably wouldn't be able to fix the button on my phone either. I took it there and without even opening it up the lady realized that the problem was probably the battery expanding. She gave me an estimate well under the quote I got from the other place. I dropped my phone off and was able to pick it up in about 2 hours. So I didn't have to anxiously live without a phone for too long haha. Anyways the quote was correct and by replacing the battery the button also started working. They were very nice and I'm a very happy customer.<//Text><UserId.>113985656885624032754< /UserId.><gmapID>0x80dcd925cef49c3b:0xcf004c4e322a0a67< /gmapID>< pictures>

What a great place.  The tech there fixed my Tablet for a very fair price and very fast.  I didn't have to leave it because it was repaired in minutes.  My Nexus wasn't cracked, it was just had a black screen which came about because I put pressure on the device.  The tech opened it up and plugged a couple of things in and it started working again.  I was receiving quotes for this that would have made the repair illogical- the quotes were so high that I would have to buy another device  But this place made it easy, quick and the price was fair.</review>

I'm an old customer and always go and do my repair at their store. All of my friends and family members are more than happy to go at this place. Because they have an awesome customer service with 6 months warranty and reasonable prices. Glad to hear their 3rd store has opened.</review><Rate>5< /Rate></record>

Good place with fast and skilled personnel, I went in with a broken screen on my iPhone 6s, Erica did such a great job. Quick and very professional. I will Forsure keep coming back in the near future, since I have a bad habit of breaking my cell phones. Ask for Erica! You won't regret her service, very skilled technician!< /review>

Brought my phone in to get my cracked screen fixed and they gave me an estimated time for it to be ready. I called near.the end of the day and they said it had to stay the night as the screen wasn't set properly so it had to be redone. I come in the next day and get my phone only to come home and notice my speaker no longer works and the camera no longer focuses and the bottom right side of the screen is already coming off. I paid $100 for a simple.fix and end up getting back a phone with more problems. They say I have a 6 month warranty but I would not trust my phone here again to try and fix the issues only to have more come up. I am very displeased and only.wish I never came here and just dealt with a cracked screen.< /Review>

My second time coming in. This time I needed a iPad Pro screen repaired. They had to order the part because iPad pros are not commonly repaired as I found out at other places as well. She was able to get the part in a few days I was happy with the repair my Apple Pencil and everything worked fine after repair. Thank you, I'll be back hopefully not soon but I'll definitely recommend this place to my friends. Also they were upfront on they cost details and showed me the part they were ordering they only charged the part cost plus labor no part markups. They called me when the part arrived and the install wasn't too long of a wait. I watched iron man on the tv while I waited. Overall this place was well equipped for customers who have to wait, it was less stressful than most other places.<//review>

<Text>stay away from this place, very bad business ethics, they order wrong parts for your phone and very cheap after market products that's not original, plus you end up making so many trips to the location which is in a ghetto area and most of the times they're closed.</Text><user>100473263216389535765< /user><resp>{'time': 1532214316388, 'text': 'Hi we never order the wrong part it was broken so we went out of our way to get it ASAP for you and drove to lake forest to get you going on your day. We are sorry if you said we didn’t order the part right which our parts are original and when we showed you the damage of the screen that it was broken so we couldn’t leave a broken screen on your phone and took it back to our vender to get another one for you and we never even repaired your phone so how would you know it wasn’t an original? We went ahead and part your part back to your phone because we order another screen from our vender that sale original and will show you my self.once again sorry for trying to help you out.'}< /resp>< user_name>

<review>One of the best restaurants. Great menu. Burgers to lentil quinoa salad. A must if you are in Malibu or cruising the Pacific Coast Highway. Great beers on tap also.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXevqpwXNws2dQFN0Ci7eC22voeD6BwXLhoqgt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlAjAh01uEnQ5XMz_6u3DZ9epmJ1S-zfWBjxuz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNik-FqRZeOxvjbqWU3hJJaQYC10cOunYWp8iUy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

<Date>1485473037794<//Date><pictures>None<//pictures><Review>Two other couples there on a Friday for lunch did not bode well and we should have turned around and left.  The food was not good.  Meat was too salty and felt processed or maybe frozen.  Come on! You have to stand out to be able to make it or at least do a couple of things really well.  Was mediocre at best...won't be back, sorry.  We were looking forward to it...< /Review><GmapID>0x80c2a0ef9e43553f:0x43cdb622308a5926< /GmapID><Resp>None< /Resp>< Name>

<Text>I was there on the 2nd night they were open and my friend and I went by earlier to check out the menu and met Marco the Owner. We came back later that day for dinner and Marco remembered us and made us feel right at home.  The food was wonderful and everyone did everything they could to make our experience fun and delicious.  It was!  Going back as soon as I can for another dinner or lunch!  I highly recommend Tavern 1<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>Our drinks were great, but we wanted to sit outside since it was a beautiful day. But there are sea gnats everywhere and even though I had a coaster to cover my drink, I still had to fish out gnats from my glass at least 5 times.

Otherwise a fine place, just make sure to sit inside.</Text>< Pictures>

Outstanding chopped salad. They mix ranch dressing with their BBQ sauce for a light, yet savory tang. Chef hits the bunt cake with ice cream, hot fudge and lots of fruit and whipped cream out if the park. We'll done Tavern 1 Team.</Review>

<text>Excellent food!  Our favorites are the tri-tip sandwich and bbq half chicken.  The meat is fresh, tender, and slow cooked with great sauce. They've added a few top-shelf salads to the menu, well worth trying.  We love how they saved the old Malibu tile and brick. Comfortable little bar. Owners and staff are casual, attentive, but not in your face.  One of Malibu's little gems.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>Really great service!
I came in and a gentleman was cleaning to close because the hours were off due to new closing times for covid. However, he still allowed me to receive a haircut after hours. Bob stayed after to give me a great haircut! Will be returning.</Review>< pictures>

I always have an awesome experience getting my hair done by Nubia. I love how she does my hair and I always gets compliments from my friends. I seen the owner cut  and style people’s hair and it  always looks awesome as well. I come from a family that cuts hair in New York so I now they do an awesome job.  I can’t wait until they open again.<//text>

<review>After having a bad experience with this chain in the past (from another location), I had my reservations. My experience at this location was the opposite. I came in as a walk in and was greeted by Tara the manager who was knowledgeable and over all a great stylist. My haircut was exactly like the photo that I showed her. I will definitely be back, and will definitely recommend.</review></record>

Went here with my wife, she went to go purchase some hair products. I was amazed at how this store keeps their products organized and nicely displayed makes shopping experience a pleasant one. I say great managing skills and really nice people working there. If I had the need for their products I would totally shop here. Great job Fantastic Sams!<//review>

< Review>
I usually get an outstanding haircut here. This time I went very early and I was the second customer of the day and no one was behind me.

I come here because I love getting my hair washed.  The woman barely spoke and didn't scrub my scalp the way every other shampoo tech has done. She also only washed my hair one time.  My hair ALWAYS needs to be washed 2x before the conditioner is worked in.  Needless to say my hair wouldn't lay down correctly because it was still dirty and with the conditioner that made it sticky.

When she took me back to her station she tried to break speed records cutting my hair.  I have weird hair, I need the top of my head to be shorter than the sides so that it will stand up and hide how thin my hair is.  The sides by my ears need to be super short.  I hate to have to tuck my hair behind my ears.

Long story short, my hair was not even, especially around my ears.  I ended up telling her that it was ok just so that I could escape.  I didn't complain to the manager because a bad haircut isn't worth it, it grows out again.  I did leave about half what I normally leave for a tip.  I hope that she gets the idea, not that I am just cheap.
Next time I will wait for the manager.</Review>

My mom and I went in for haircuts and we took notice right away that the sign in sheet was on lined paper. The place had a funny smell to it. We should’ve left then. Bob cut my mom’s hair and this lady named Didi cut mine. The man was overly friendly and did a poor job and the lady was rude and didn’t even bother to wash my hair until we requested it. They didn’t even go by the pictures we showed them and they pretended that they knew what hair cut style we wanted. She did an ok job but still horrible service. We will definitely not be going back there again!</text>

<Review>Went to this salon with my best friend, and watched her get her hair cut. She has beautiful naturally curly hair but her hair was straight when she was at the salon. She asked for him to cut her dead ends off so her hair could be healthy. He told her, and I swear I'm not lying " maybe you need to go to a black salon , maybe they will know what to do with your hair". Will never set foot in this salon again. We're both African American , Hispanic , and White , last time I checked anyone with proper training and talent can cut and style any hair no matter what your nationality or ethnic background is.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b43dac262977:0xd73d321fb1e23a78</Gmap_id></record>

The lady said. "Oh I don't eave the tools to cut the hair any better. You need to go to a braver. We are stylists...." do not go here if you want a good haircut.
The price was $15.99 plus tip. DO NOT GO THERE IF YOU ARE IN NEED OF A FADE.</Text>

Do NOT do business here!! I had an appointment but was told to come back the next day. They could not understand what i wanted even after showing them a picture. I caught a cab down there so I I was disgusted when I was told to come back tomorrow! Not a professional place and I will be reporting them. Very rude staff!!< /review>

Went to get my hair dyed today from black to a bright burgundy. The lady that did my hair refused to listen to me when I haf informed her to used a 40 deveolper instead of a 20 developer in order to bleach my hair to get the bright color I wanted. She proceeded to use the 20 developer and after acknowledging that my hair was not light enough yet, she proceeded to put in the hair color that I had brought in myself. My roots were still black and my hair was not evenly bleached so the end result was my hair being a brownish color instead of a bright burgundy as I wanted. I was very unsatisfied with my result. I would not recommend coming to this salon to anyone.< /Text>

I went to go get a hair cut today, the worst experience. The stylist refused to listen to me and completely butchered my hair and now I have to wear a hair for the rest of the summer and fall, and had very poor customer service. Would never go back!!!</review>

The woman who did my hair was very rude and unprofessional. She didn't bother to wash my hair before she cut it, and then charged $25 for something that literally took her about 5-7 minutes.<//review>

< Review>
This skatepark had a great set-up, with a couple of bowls, lots of rails, a huge area around the entire park for riding. Also, there is a cool area built for beginners with a miniature bowl and tabletop. Caution! If you are bringing little kids, stay with them. They can get seriously injured if they get in the way of the more experienced skaters. BMX bikes and scooters are welcome. There are specific rules for using the park during Covid-19, but no one was following them.< /Review>

<Review>Packed with people. The fencing needs to be pushed back for a bigger dynamic Apprentice or make another skate park. The fencing adjustment would be a cheaper fix.</Review>< Rate>

Since they finally allowed scooters, so many more people go and enjoy it now. Lots of fun and a pretty friend environment. After all the kids he out of school is when it gets crowded.< /review>

Not a good place to bring young kids who want to skate. The dirty dropouts are seriously rude and think they own the park. Besides the losers the park is nice.< /Text>

Has terrain for all levels of skaters, scooters, and bikers. But please dont bring you razor scooter riding 5 year old unless there is no one at the park cause that gets extremely annoying when they snake everyone.</review>

<time>1609441047710<//time><Rating>1</Rating><review>Worst experience, I usually don’t post reviews but this was outrageous. I’m a regular customer at anjappar. We ordered 3 sets of idly and chicken curry and all the food items very so bad. The idly was so hard and too much baking soda. I called the restaurant to inform them that the given food is bad, so I need an exchange food for that. But the manager was so stubborn and said no. We didn’t want to do anything because of this my family missed a proper dinner , we had to throw the food out. The manager was not even convincing, he bluntly said we can’t do anything. He was being so rude. They are doing this to the regular customers, I feel bad for new customers trying to get any food there. Be cautious before ordering here, THEY WONT GIVE ANY PROPER FOOD AND WONT HELP TO EVEN PROVIDE A BETTER FOOD FOR THAT. VERY BAD< /review>< resp>

<date>1619719675465< /date><text>Gobi manchurian has always been my favorite from here. I really liked the way I was treated when I placed the order on the home, the person who picked my call was really patient and took the orders diligently, he also waited patiently until my toddler stopped screaming.
My experience with dine in was great as well, we loved the paneer butter masala, garlic naan, chapathis and baby corn manchurian gravy. I felt the veg corn soup was a little too watery than what I expected and it was way too hot when it was placed on our table. I feel the soup shouldn't be too hot that we have to wait to drink it.
Overall we had a great experience<//text>< Rating>

This place has good dosas but all other kinds of dishes are consistently mediocre. Strongly advise you to skip anything not dosa.

Relying on inordinately little waitstaff, service has as well is underwhelming. Plan to spend at least 1.5 hours here for dinner.

<rating>1< /rating><review>Don't fall for the brand name "ANJAPPAR", it does not do justice for the Chettinad cuisine, taste is not even 20% to the original "ANJAPPARS" in India, quality is really bad and the taste is atrocious. I ordered the below items .
1. Nethili fry --- was not fresh, they have not used the right fish and masala
2. Mutton Masala - Meat was very old not fresh rubbery texture, masala composition was very bad nothing but grinded pepper making it just very spicy, you cannot sense nothing but pepper in your palette.
3. Mutton Biriyani - No flavor of mutton in the biriyani, too much of DALDA(vegetable oil) added to give the biriyani meat fat flavor which was extremely annoying.
4 . Chicken Nuggets - They were just fine as per the taste, but too much of oil
5. Parotta - I would recommend this, I have given one star only for the parotta, they were extremely soft, fluffy and fresh.

JUST DON'T BRING BAD NAME FOR CHETTINAD CUISINE....need to go long way to be authentic< /review>< userid>

Orders were placed in quick succession and hence they were delayed accordingly. But when we went up to the front desk every 10mins in order to collect the completed orders, the person was rude and said I’ll waive my hand when yours is done, until then sit in your car. Funny part is that he never waived or called my number to inform our orders have arrived. I ended up going after 15-20 mins to pick them. Overall, I wish I knew the name of the gentleman so that I could inform the management. Typically your food tastes good but on this particular Saturday, it was over cooked and burnt. Hopefully you do consider our feedback and make sure it’s not repeated to retain the goodwill generated over several years.< /Text>

I have to say the food was fine and not bad. But two of us ate here and the bill was 47 dollars which was unexpected . Would I come again ? No, because the taste of the food isn’t that great so as to justify a $ 47 Bill< /text>

I have only been here twice.  The first time I got butter chicken to go and it was really good.  I am biased because my mother is an amazing cook, and I rarely like restaurant Indian food, but I liked this.  The second time I went I decided to try the stir fry noodles (I think that’s what it’s called).  I was expecting chow neon, in the indo Chinese style but I was sorely disappointed.  I will go back again to get the true Indian food.< /review>

<Rating>4</Rating><text>Delicious food, decent ambience and good service. Couldn't have asked for more.  We had the masala dosa, pepper chicken gravy, fish 65, chicken lollipop, malabar parathas, nethili fry,pomfret fry and buttermilk. Everything was just perfect except the pepper chicken which just wasn't to our liking. My third visit and I'd keep going back for the Nethili fry, fish 65 and the masala dosa and maybe try out more items on the menu!!</text>< pictures>

Food is good and tasty.
We ordered Mixed fried rice , egg fried rice and chili chicken with gravy.

Fried rice was huge portions , loaded with eggs.

Mixed fried rice had chicken , mutton and big pieces of shrimp!!!

Sunday afternoon was crowded.
Food was served quickly even though it was crowded.< /Text>

Food is quality. Some dishes can be a bit oily. One of the best chicken tandoori I've ever had. Cauliflower (Gobi 65) a must. Recommended.< /review>

<Text>Santa clara restaurant clearly nowhere close to Milpitas outlet. Big let down if you ever dined at Anjappar at Milpitas

1. Chicken Biryani was just awful. Chicken was well cooked but very dark and oily. Rice was tasty though (phew!)
2. Paneer butter masala was ok
3. Roti was was ok too

This was second bad experience so would definitely consider some other options in santa clara next time<//Text><GmapID>0x808fb587d773b913:0xb22f55fc5bbe60c7<//GmapID><Response>None</Response>< Time>

I have visited this place several times. I have had different lunch combinations. I liked the Executive Biryani lunch. Food is consistently spicy. Restaurant is clean with nice decor. Service was always quick. Recommend this place if you are tired of bland indian buffets else where. As long as you can handle spicy Indian food you will like it!< /Text>

This restaurant has the best Appam I've had in the bay area. Paired it with their Anjappar Chicken Curry (boneless), which was spicy, flavorful and complemented the Appam's fairly neutral flavor.<//review>

Went on a fine Saturday afternoon about 230 with full crowd, since we were just 2 wait time was about 15 minutes, for larger crowds wait time was easily 30 minutes. But they served food very quick, we ordered veg biriyani, paneer manchiruan and a non veg meal. All of them were served in under 5 minutes. Food was spicy and great. We enjoyed and had a great Saturday afternoon.</Text>

<Text>Good Indian food with a southern India influence. Believe me its different. Irritating staffing situation during covid. No one would be present at the semi locked door with a plastic non see through drape and you have to keep knocking at the door to get some one s attention to serve you the food you have already paid for.< /Text>< Date>

<review>Natu Kozhi briyani was really good. The Tawa fish fry was not great. I ordered 1 chicken briyani and 1 Natu Kozhi briyani and called them immediately and asked to change the chicken one to  Natu Kozhi. It was only 35 cents difference in Doordash and they told me since it's higher cost they can't switch the briyani. I mentioned I was visiting and a tourist here and really wanted to try Natu Kozhi, but they weren't nice enough. I was disappointed that 35 cents mattered more to them than customer happiness.<//review>< Pics>

No consideration for dietary requirements. The vegetarian food had meat almost every time we visited.

<review>It would be a crime to go here and NOT order Chicken Lollipop. It's THAT GOOD!

Must visit if you wanna have Indian cuisine in the Bay Area. It's authentic and food tastes exactly same as that of restaurants back in India. Also do not miss the Falooda.</review><userid>112704831455032777631< /userid><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqpKQdc_eQySli61wbBIbO-InNX-JXV0wRPzJ_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><username>Umang Sardesai</username><Rating>5<//Rating>< Gmap_id>

Nice Indian restaurant. My friend was from India and he took me here and said he liked it. He orders like a platter for me so I can taste everything. Some of the little bowls I don’t really like. I enjoyed about half of the platter. Not really sure what I ate lol because it’s hard to tell from the shape of the food. Some of them was really spicy, even to my Indian friend standard. Service was fast and friendly. The thing you chew before you get out of the restaurant to clean your mouth was actually quite good. It was some kind of sweet wrapped inside a leaf.< /review>

<Review>The feeling is at about 3.5 stars!

We came as they were closing lunch time (3pm) on Christmas day but they were nice to accommodate us anyways.

Service was super fast and friendly and the place overall is neat. Portions are quite big per person and pricing is good.

Between the four of us we ordered:

- fish 65
- prawn biryani
- egg curry
- non veg thali
- steamed idlis
- mysore masala dosa

I didn't try the fish 65 but the others weren't very pleased with it. Egg curry was good for our vegetarian friend. Non veg thali had everything in it with beautiful flavors and you could distinguish the different flavors from the different meats. Idlis were fluffy and quite soft but the mysore masala dosa was too soggy :( so that was a let down. Prawn biryani was so tasty and flavorful but quite spicy so ask for yogurt and lots of fresh cut limes to put on top to ease the spice levels.

Food is spicy and full on masala so I would skip dinner and stick to lunch so you can digest your food. It is definitely not a place where I see myself coming too often since the food is heavy and too spicy even for Indians themselves ;) bring napkins for tears and running nose :P< /Review><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x808fb587d773b913:0xb22f55fc5bbe60c7<//GmapID><userid>107802058118069961657</userid>< Pics>

For first few visits, I did not know this place is so much posh and famous. Their menu book is one of the biggest amongst its peers; they have at least 13-14 categories. Their non-vegetarian dosa and kutthu parotas are really good. Also, they always surprised me when I asked the servers to recommend, so try it. My personal recommendation is something called Nannari sherbet and all the dishes in Kannada and Malayalam delicacies.< /review>

<Review>Nowhere near the quality of the other branch in Kuala Lumpur which was one of my favorites. And we didnt expect so. It was Still ok and delicious.
However, the Goat briyani was rather cold. Our server was very kind and friendly. I am not indian but I liked the authentic indian music that was being played which was in accordance to the theme of the restaurant and the food.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxNQbOTGQzqkdpDCOzsl3MtSyaMu34KmqIMQMW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

Excellent Chettinad food with great ambience, music and service.
Lots of good vegetarian options available too.

I tried the babycorn manchurian and Rava Onion Masala Dosa. Quantity of manchurian was spicy and is good enough to split among two people. The Dosa is also really big, crispy with great flavour.</review>

One of the busiest restaurant around. That's because of the taste factor I guess. We have been visiting many years and nothing changed but traffic. Plenty of parking around, nice decor, clean and better varieties.< /review>

Very busy Indian place. Here you will get mostly South Indian cuisine, however North Indian and the indo-Chinese foods are also available. The starters I ate were Gobi manchurian and chicken lollipop. Those were absolute yum! In the main course I ordered some spicy chicken ( May be, the pepper chicken chettinad style or similar). This was quite on the spicier side. So if you cannot stand with the hotness, ask them to make it low/ medium spicy. Ordered naan and the appam to pair with the chicken dish. The naan was kinda okay, but the appam was great. One of my friends ate the masala dosha, which I would hardly rate as 3 out of 5!</Review>

Jan 2019: Probably one of the best veg manchurian I ate in USA.
Only recommendation is to increase the manchurian balls to the portion (gravy) size.

Having been to Anjappar in Santa Clara quite a while, I can say this restaurant can quench some of those spice thirst and indian cravings you have. Be it be a manchurian or a thali or a dessert these guys totally know what they are doing. This review is again strictly about this location...</review>

Absolutely loved it..!!
This is one of my best places to visit.

The food is authentic. But if you like spicy food. This is the best place to visit.

Usually this place is little over crowded. But it worth waiting.

I have given 4* because of the prices.</text>

Wouldn't go back. Ordered online at 5:44. Said it would be ready at 6:09. Didn't get my food until 7:27. That's a 1 hour, 43 minute wait. I asked the wait staff 4 times for an update on my order, but was never given one. When I finally got my order it looked like it had been sitting out for a while and no one had checked on it.

Also we asked for the butter chicken to be mild, but it came med-high spicy.

We did get a free paratha for the delay, because I pressed them on it, but that definitely doesn't make up for it.

The food was tasty, but I wouldn't go back for fear of the wait. There's lot of great Indian in Santa Clara with better service.</text>

Great food and good service. Tends to get a bit crowded and is noisy especially at peak hours, but I’ve noticed that about all Indian restaurants in the US so far. They also have some good entrees from Kerala that are worth trying.</review>

Went on Sunday for food pick up. The place was really busy and I had to wait a while - which was expected. The lady at the counter was polite and tries her best to accomodate people. The food is excellent - especially chicken lollipop. The best I have had in the bay area! A must visit!<//Text>

Anjappars never disappoint you with the variety and this place is nothing different. 3 days my stay in Santa Clara, I went there everyday to try something different. Tastes good and authentic. The secret may be home grounded spices!! Crab curry and Egg porotta are a must try. Be careful about spice level. 1 star less for the restroom cleanliness though!!</review>

Amazing food. A must go to for South Indian food. Beautiful ambiance and friendly service. Have been there couple of times the food quality has been consistent. Reasonable rates and worth the price.

Good food and OK service.

The food is decent South Indian fare and they’ve recently added some more menu options. The photos in the menu don’t necessarily depict food in the menu. I found this out when asking I asked for a item shown in the picture and the server first got confused and then just said “ok”. The food that came was something completely different :)

The food tasted good though and I frequent this place. The wait staff is not really experienced in waiting tables so sometime there could be long periods of time when you want their attention and they never make eye contact with you :)< /text>

<Review>Good restaurant to try spicy food. The taste of the food is awesome and they provide a lott of options. Very difficult to decide what to order when you go for the first time because of too much variety in cuisine's. It's a good problem to have ;)< /Review>< pics>

<Text>We went today.Worst food ever . Do not go there and if I have a zero star I will give it. The service was so bad and the manager was rude. The food does not look and taste Indian at all. We order biryani chicken ( the rice look yellow with no taste and they just put fried dried small pieces of chicken on top, very bad; our stomach hurts after. The rice we ordered was full of old fried eggs that tasted sooooooo yucky, it looks like as if it is Chinese food and nothing to do with other Indian restaurants. It was our first time there and we will never go there again. The chicken masala has a very weird taste as if they  put BBQ sauce in it.  Not recommended, not recommended million of times . Zero and Zero rating . Do not waste your time and money on this rubbish food.
We told them our concerns and they did not care at all , they just want to collect money without good service. We spent about $79 on this expensive tasteless dog food. Bad experience and hope you read this before you go to this “restaurant”.<//Text>< Pics>

They do have better chefs and they do customize spice levels according to our taste buds.. BUT! Don't go beyond medium spicy as they are way too spicy and upsets our stomach and taste buds (I believe the extra spicy are just raw addition of spices!)<//Text><Date>1550273994094</Date>< Rate>

I remember coming to this place when it was their grand opening. I loved how nice they treat you here. The waiter was so nice and accommodating and the food is great too. I frequented this place when I used to work close by but stopped going after I moved. Came here recently since my folks were in town and my mom loved the food. She finished her entire plate which is a big deal since shes a picky eater. The prix fix lunch menu is super cheap considering the fact that they give you a three course meal plus a drink. This is a great place to stop by for lunch or dinner.< /text>

<review>I live close by so this has been my go to place for few years now.

But the quality has gone down in recent months. They unreasonably jack up chilly level to cater certain crowd. Chettinad receipes use black pepper and it can get spicy but not to the level they have.< /review>< Rating>

<Review>Extremely disappointed. We tried Chicken Thali which was around $15 without tax (similar to a buffet price), however the quality and quantity was very bad. Chicken chettinad served was smelling horribly. Cudnt even eat one scant quantity.  I went entirely to get the taste of chettinad masala and the smell made me almost puke. For kids, they hv chicken nuggets which are processed packet one. Not good for toddler. Cant believe something like this is rated even more than one star. Better avoid.</Review><userid>113035607632348753099</userid></record>

<Text>Good food, a little wait for a table and service but understandable since the restaurant is always full. A note of caution to those that do not enjoy spicy food, let them know your level of spice tolerance. It's Chettinad and by default meant to be spicy :).<//Text><Rating>4< /Rating><gmapID>0x808fb587d773b913:0xb22f55fc5bbe60c7< /gmapID>< Date>

This branch in Santa Clara has no food standards I don’t know what type of chicken they use. Whenever I had food from here the chicken that I order felt stiff but the branch in Milpitas CA is the best never had any problem at that location.< /Review>

Food is generally good. I typically get food to go. So not sure service for sit-in. Generally the food tends to be more oily, more than necessary. Why one star down.</review>

<review>One of the nicest Indian restaurants I've been to in the Bay Area. Authentic North Indian food starting from appetizers, main course and the desserts. Their paneer tikka is a must try. So is their navaratan korma. The service is tardy though, else this deserves all 5 stars.</review><GmapID>0x808fb587d773b913:0xb22f55fc5bbe60c7< /GmapID><name>Akul S<//name><UserId.>104980346610246887405< /UserId.>< rating>

< Review>
I ordered Butternut Chicken takeouts for my daughter's birthday that was not suitable for children (too spicy), despite I specifically mentioned non spicy and I asked if it was suitable for children.
It basically ruined the BD dinner and I had to cook pasta in emergency for the guests.
I contacted the Restaurant from their website and received no answer.
They seems to care about their fancy look but less about the food and the customer service...
Bad experience< /Review>

Usually food here is good but 2 days ago when I got my Togo order it was too salty, Could not eat even a single bite. Next day I took back food almost as is to tell and show them how salty it was but cashier there was least bothered to address it. He said he can’t do anything, he will let his manager call me. I keep the food on their desk and left. Guess what ? No one called me to check on that.<//text>

This place is delightfully spicy! Chennai food that isn't dumbed down. Process are reasonable and atmosphere isn't bad. Service is prompt, though not enthusiastic. Food makes this a clear 5 🌟</Text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>I am an Anjappar fan, and often go to the Anjappar on McCarthy Ranch, San Jose. So I was so excited to discover an Anjappar closer to me, since I was getting my car serviced at Stevens Creek. This is a much smaller Anjappar, and the staff doesn't seem as savvy or enthusiastic! The food itself - Egg Podimas and Roti hit the mark, but Egg Masala was too sweet for my taste! And this is a dish I often eat and love at San Jose campus, so this was disappointing. Even with lack of a real crowd on a Friday afternoon, the service was disappointing and slow.
I would come back to this place, since I just love their Egg Podimas, but this is definitely an average experience as a whole and I can't give it anymore than a 3 - would he unfair!< /review>< Pics>

I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala. Hardly any pieces of chicken! And definitely not chicken breast as mentioned. Its like they are trying to just print money by giving as less and charge more. This has happened previously with another chicken dish. Really disappointed. Have decided not to go here anymore.< /Review>

Ordered a non veg thali which is $20 excluding tax. But the gravies and rice came in very small box. After paying so much, the food was not sufficient for one person’s meal. As u increase the price, you should also increase the quantity at least a bit< /text>

Love the Chicken lollipops here! Just the best. So is their thali's. Most non vegetarian options are excellent. Asian cuisine is pretty good too.

This location is better than the one in Milpitas.  I like the way their service is. And they are always prompt. Space is more cozy!

Parking might be a little hassle. But I'm sure you will always find it.  I think there's parking in the side ,but not at the back.</Text>

Maybe some speed bumps were to be had when they opened.

We were impressed with the quantity and quality of what we got here. And always enjoy it! We sometimes come two or three nights in a row.

Nice if the appetizers came out before the rest of the food.. But that issue is very minor compared to the good.

Well worth checking out!!< /review>

Don’t try to order and pickup from this restaurant. It’s really a mess. I’ve arrived 30 minutes after ordering and 30 mins wait time. While ordering, they’ll tell your order will be ready in 20 mins. This is on Weekday 🤣🤣<//Text>

<Text>The food quality is OK. The quantity is very less especially if you take goat biryani you can get max of two peices I guess.  That compared to biryani bowl or Bawarchi is too less,  where you get around 7 to 8 pieces.The prices are also higher compared to other similar restaurants.</Text>< Pics>

Usually I don't eat spicy food but this place somehow makes me want to eat.. I don't know about other items in their menu but their chicken curry and parota combo was awesome.. Extremely spicy but no complains.. Also their chicken drumstick is awesome< /Text>

I have been here before, and I will still say that I love this place. Food is really amazing, especially the dosa and the varieties of chutney that you provide. Please also keep vada sambhar as a dish, as that is not available here. Being a south Indian restaurant, it was shocking to me that vada is not available here. Otherwise, starting from starters to desserts, everything was amazing. Totally worth going here. Both non veg and veg dosas are too good.<//Text>

Worst service. Nobody come to ask for food. Food is coming one by one what we ordered in entrees. We ate half of the dinner in appetizer plates. Got the condiment almost at the end of the dinner. Suggest to never go here.<//Review>

Loved the soup and Ceylon paratha. Very good ambience and helpful staff. One small suggestion to improve customer satisfaction - please go around and check the customers at frequent intervals as I see many of them waiting to order more food or request additional sauce or water etc...< /text>

One of the best restaurants I've visited. Amazing Chikku milkshake and mushroom dosa as well as thangapal uthappam. I would definitely come again! Service was a little slow as it was very crowded when I went. Nice fine dining place.< /Text>

Waited for 10 minutes and no one to take order. This is despite the fact we are one of the 3 families.

While waiting for food, couple of interesting things noticed. restaurant is filled with bugs and mosquito s. Then they started some big fan and restaurant got filled with bad/foul smell.

Food was good and we loved paneer 65.</Review>

Have been here back in January 2019 had some amazing food. Mived to california recently and was excited to visit this place! But was a disappointment. Ordered from this place couple of times on doordash but have received tasteless food. Been there with friends and have been disappointed, ordered 5 dishes and left all of them uneaten.
On giving the review to the server received no response in return. Would not recommend since they cannot keep up with their services!!!<//Review>

Last evening I ordered fish finger and chicken curry. Both of the dish was worst to eat. It’s almost spoiled and should be trashed. When I complain to waiter and cashier about the food. They don’t even bother to take any action or help me getting fresh one. Worst service and quality. Recommending not to have food in this restaurant.< /text>

This place has a lack of good food, though they have a surplus of expensive prices.

We started with ordering a Biriyani which was clearly not made authentically - instead of chicken cooked with roce iba nice sauce the chicken had been cooked separately, and then added to rice and neither were well blended with flavor or spice.

We sent that back and ordered new dishes - what I cannot remember, but they did not improve on the taste. We then ordered various roti (breads) all of which fell flat on their face - neither fresh tasting nor authentic.

We ended up spending $70+ for two people and we were not close to satisfied with any of the food.

They were also very slow to serve and we saw people standing in line for 15 minutes, plus.

I would caution you to go. Ignore the convenience of the location, you’ll regret going if you do.</Text>

They're super super tasty but I really wish they would tone down the spice level or at least accommodate requests for low spice. The flavors are great but 9/10 items are "Burn all the way in, burn all the way out" spicy.< /text>

<Review>The horrible experience these days of these hotels...kind request ever visit on Fridays and weekends.

If you place any orders they’re taking almost 45 to an hour to serve without hot...they always serve takeaways...you need to keep waiting and they won’t tell or inform you how long should wait....

Briyani taste gone away....not an impressive place these days..

Think twice for better and peaceful food before going to this place 😂😂😂😂</Review><user_name>Ramakrishnan Subramaniam<//user_name>< Date>

Have never regretted any visit to this place. The food is consistently tasty. The samba rice chicken biriyani is my favorite though the non veg thali meals is also quite good. Food is not overpriced and portion sizes are sufficient.</Text>

A great place to have some really awesome chettinad (and surprisingly Indo-Chinese) food in the Bay Area. Although Indian food is great in South Bay, this is one of my favorite spots.

Location and Ambience: The place is located in a shopping complex with other shops and food joints and therefore it has plenty of parking spots. The inside of the restaurant is alright but not great by bay area standards. We got a table near the front which was pretty comfortable. The place isn't too loud.

Wait times: Although I hear wait times are horrible at this spot, I've never had problem getting a spot (even for larger groups), at least during lunch/weekends.

Service: The staff was friendly and very accommodating. 2 members of our group were delayed. Yet they allowed the rest of our group to sit and order. We also needed some time to order since we had a large group, and all the while the staff was completely okay with it. The food arrived pretty quickly, although one dish at a time, which was slightly annoying, but the taste made up for it.

Food: I am leaving 5 stars just for the food. Be warned, chettinad food is supposed to be spicy, so expect that in anything you order. I loved the authenticity of the food, something that a lot of places miss out on. The Indo-Chinese is spot on. I recommend the Vegetable Manchurian (Dry), Chicken Lollypop, Chilly Chicken (Dry), and the Fried rice. And from the chettinad menu, I recommend prawn masala, mutton sukka varuval, kothu parotha (mutton or chicken), fish curry (or mutton curry) with appam, biryani and the non-veg meal. After all of this food, i was ready for a nap. The filter coffee, buttermilk and lime soda were all great companions to the crazy lunch we had.

Overall, I give this place 5 stars, just for the food. If you want to have a great time, you need to ignore everything and just focus on the food here.< /text>

Got friend King fish as an appetizer and got fish Thali. Taste was good. Portion is a little less than other places in bay area. Service is below average.<//text>

We love there food . There chettinad biriyani is super hot and we absolutely love it. So is there starter chicken fries. But our last visit was on a Friday evening. We reached there around 7:45 and came out around 10:30. It took us 20 mins to get a sit. After that 30 mins to get the menu card. And more then an hour to get the food on table.<//review>

Food is tasty but it'll take you 40 minutes to get it and then another 30 just to get your bill. Don't count on any water refills.<//text>

< Review>
Food is really good as always

But service was not good this time.

We requested 2 plain naan, 2 butter naan, one cheese naan and one Malabar paratha.

They missed to give butter naan

On top of that first they were saying they gave everything then they said may be they missed plain naan not butter naan. Then we some how they end up agreeing that they missed it.

Also first they served our order on another table then we said that's our order...

Service was bad though</Review>

Spicy food and very good taste. Certainly better than the other Saravana bhavans in the area. But you will get less attention on  busy Friday evenings.</text>

Ambience was good. Seated promptly. Ordering process was smooth. The biriyani orders were devoid of chicken or goat. Was sent back  but came back the same way. Chicken nugget order was overcooked, sent back but came back the same way. At tht point with kids, we just wanted to get done.
Not going back.< /Review>

Good place for south indian cuisine. We ordered the mysore masala and paneer masala ..it was quite tasty.

The chutneys and sambhar are good but spicy. Overall the food tends to be spicy but overall its tasty.

Note: Paneer masala dosa comes with  cubes of paneer and is not smashed paneer. However the taste is great</review>

<review>Worst price classification. 2 pieces barota + mutton is $10.50. If you order 2 extra pieces of barota , they charge $7 for each ,total $14.00. Don't ask for extra barota, buy it as combo. Have to wait for long time to get the items on table even other tables are empty.
Don't expect customer friendly service.</review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< username>

Hands down, the best Indian food I have had in USA. Prices are nominal, variety is too much and tastes the best. Must go if ur a Indian foodie visiting San Jose.< /text>

<Review>It used to be one of my favorite place but after today, I am putting it on my black list. The food quality is totally bad. Its greasy and just not tasty. I was starving when I got there and I could not finish my food. Sorry Anjappar, you have lost your edge.<//Review><Name>Amresh Vaidya< /Name><date>1486107100961</date><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

Expensive and not good food. Ordered pick up. They didn't even have plasticware. Got the butter chicken, mild. Tastes weird, almost sweet. And it was very spicy. Oh and they forgot the rice. Mango Lassi wasny bad at least. Restaurant setting was pleasant, but I shouldn't have even been there if it wasn't for the fact that they didn't have plasticware. Go elsewhere.</Text>

**NEVER CALL THEM AND ORDER TOGO, DO DOORDASH OR UBEREATS INSTEAD**

This review is only for to-go order i have ordered. Not for the food. I called Friday evening at 8:30PM, they say i can go and pickup in 25 mins. I reached there at 9, they told food is not ready yet. Still acceptable. I waited patiently till 9:30, then the guy who was giving the to go orders told they have already gave my order to someone else. That is ridiculous management, if you guys are not able to take and fulfill phone to go orders then just don't take it. Just restrict it to the food delivery companies, let them make some money.
They had re prepare the order and gave it to me at 10:00PM. That too without even a apology! Not going to order a to go from this place ever!< /text>

Great spicy food.  More for meat eaters than vegetarians though.  I recommend the country chicken, Gobi 65, and the dry mutton that they have on Fridays.< /text>

Stating this, this is the only place where I can navaratan kurma with fruits and fresh veggies exactly what I used to get back home.  If anyone wants to try a naan or roti with vegetarian gravy based food I would suggest navaratan kurma.  I have heard their nandu masala (crab masala) is great as well, I'm yet to try that.  In all a good place to have chettinad food.< /Text>< date>

This place is not as great as India ones. Few things were apparent - the oil they used was not the same as in India. I didn't like it, but might be due to us market. Second, fish wasn't fresh. May be due to shipping and storing fish for long time. Also, coconut payasam wasn't available. It was okay place. I did like egg dosa though.<//Text>

We also had Mango ice cream and gulab jamun. Gulab juman was a bit on the firm side but taste was good.
Overall, good clean place with nice staff to have Indian food.< /text>< Pics>

Food cannot taste worse than this place. The sambar in the veg thali had gone bad. The guy waiting on us took it in when I asked him about it and never came back to say anything. After about 20 mins, when I called him to ask about it, he says it had gone bad because of the season (summer). No explanation no apology for having served food that could cause food poisoning. I asked to speak to the manager and no one showed up. The chicken biryani was nothing but tomato rice with chicken in it. Overall, bad experience, horrible food - get ready to waste your money.< /review>

Its too ridiculous and very worst service.
For 30 minutes we didn't even get water glasses and got the food after another 30 mins and this time plates were missing. Please serve your customers well, we can understand and expect this kind of service during busy hours, but it doesn't looks good if you treat the customers in the same way during non busy hsy hours when all the tables are empty.<//review>

Ok so a group of us (about 15 give or take) get here about 8pm Friday night. BAD CHOICE. They take no reservations so for a good hour and half the group of us were crammed onto a table fit for 10 until the table next to us left and we got the privilege of being able to breath again. They took more than an hour JUST TO TAKE OUR GOD FORSAKEN ORDER and now as I'm writing this it is currently 10pm and only like 10 people have gotten their food. ON TOP OF THAT they just randomly cancel orders and run out of food after 8pm.  Service is terrible. It takes like 5 minutes just to flag a person down. Our table wasn't even set up properly. We had no cups, silverware, plates and water even when we asked like 3 times. They forget parts of the orders. For the thali they forgot the roti like what are you doing. Overall, WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IN A MILLION YEARS.<//text>

Unsure why this place only has 3 stars. I guess it's probably due to snobby Californians who refuse to rate a chain more than 3 stars.

Only reason why I docked 1 star from this place is because of 1) slow service/lack of attentiveness and 2) LACK OF CHEESE IN THE CHEESE NAAN!

Every time I come here, I ask for extra cheese in the cheese naan. They happily charge me $1 for extra cheese, but I actually receive extra cheese in it about 30% of the time. Even when I specifically state "please put lots and lots and lots of cheese in the cheese naan", I'll generally get little to no cheese in it. Trust me, when they load it up with cheese, this is an incredible dish. One time they put an adequate amount of cheese in it and the only other time they did after that was when I told them "Last time you charged me for extra cheese and there was basically no cheese in it. Please, please, please make sure you put A LOT of cheese in it".

Now that I'm done with my cheese rant, onto the food. The food is amazing here.

Chicken/Paneer 65: 4.5/5 - not super spicy like most chicken 65, but delicious. More like chicken pakodas with a bit of spice. Paneer 65 is also great. Interested in trying Mushroom 65, but haven't given it a chance yet since it's the same price as Paneer 65... can't justify buying at that pricepoint.

Hot & Sour Soup: 5/5 - extremely spicy and flavorful. I can come here and order only this 1 by 2 and leave completely satisfied.

Cheese Naan: 2/5 when they skimp on the cheese; 5/5 when they load it up.

Chicken Chettinad: 5/5 - Haven't tasted it here because I'm not a huge fan of the dish in general, but my wife loves it. She gets the combo, which comes with a smaller portion of chicken and a side of parotta. This is a great call, because I'm not a fan of chicken chettinad and she doesn't eat much -- perfect portion!

Goat Biryani: 4/5 - Extremely flavorful biryani, but unfortunately the goat pieces are a bit on the chewy side + no marrow bones :(

Black Pepper Chicken Kabab: 2.5/5 -- These are well cooked, but I only recommend them if you're a HUGE fan of black pepper. They use whole peppercorns and, for me, they were a bit overwhelming.

Pro-Tip: Order the Chicken 65 Biryani. It's a good call if you're trying to save some $$ and are craving biryani and chicken 65.

The server we always get is SUPER SUPER polite. Love the guy. Unfortunately, the food comes out at a snails pace... worth the wait though. Main qualm about this place is they need to just get their act together and load up the cheese on that cheese naan!<//review>

First off...i was waiting one FULL HOUR before anyone came to my table despite my waving and asking for service. It took another full hour before my food came. Im not even exaggerating people...I honestly have never experienced worse customer service in my life.

They refilled my water once in the three hours I was there..

The food was just ok once it finally came. Not as spicy as everyone makes it out to be.

I will never recommend this place to anyone that asks< /Review>

Don't get fooled by the brand name, They are just another Indian restaurant here serving avg tasting Indian food. May be you can find similar menu items know for this brand but not the same taste.< /review>

Delicious Lunch Thalis!!

We were here for lunch and were served one of the delicious south Indian non-veg thalis around bay area.
What we ordered:
Anjappar Popular Non Veg Meal- comes with Chettinad chicken masala, mutton curry, fish curry, three types of vegetables, chapati, rasam, white rice, sweet, yogurt, pickle and pappad. Delicious Chettinad flavours.
Chicken Meal- Comes with Chicken curry and all other veggie items above- Equally spicy and delicious. Can't ask for more.
Meal were enough to fill the craving appetites.

Restaurant is pretty decent in size and the serving was faster in comparison.
Will try other items on the menu soon.</Text>

Nice ambience, good food and spice levels, friendly staff. Highly recommend a visit. Had Chicken Biriyani, Pepper Chicken Dry, Jira Rice, and Papad, found it sufficient for 2 people.<//Review>

Worst experience
We ordered Butter chicken along with other veg and non veg entrees. Service is very slow and few items were served when we were done with our dinner. Some chicken slices were not cooked and when I mentioned the matter to the waiter, he simply refused to even come and see the dish saying the chicken was cooked in Tandoor oven and  that there was no point in taking a look at my dish. I have taken photograph of uncooked butter chicken
I am not going to this restaurant again and do not recommend< /Review>

I had been on July 03 2016 for dinner, Food was horrible. I asked for chicken biryani they gave mutton rice with mutton bones and chicken 65 pieces. After ordering, food came after 1 hour, I asked for pepper chicken dry they gave pepper chicken curry, most important service was very bad<//Review>

Ask for karaikudi chicken. Not on the menu. Phenomenal. Very spicy though. Aloo kulcha is also excellent.

The place is better for non vegetarians.< /review>

<Review>Good. But not upto the expectations. Ordered an idly combo and was surprised to see uncooked idly. Then returned it for an appam combo. Payasam was just milk and a spoon of poha in it!! :(

Update: Recent visits were pleasant. Ordered rava dosa, podi masala dosa, chicken kothu parota, shezwan fried rice and thali several times. Everything was delicious. Thali especially kara kozhambu is a must try. Chinese dishes have indo-chinese tastes and are well done and consistently good. Give it a try to relish the delicacies.<//Review>< pics>

The food used to be good at this place. But now it has gone bad. I ordered chicken 65, egg omlet and sweet corn chicken soup all where very salty. I asked to replace the omlet. Then i realised all the food that came one after the other are VERY salty. WORST FOOD..<//Text>

Loved veg manchurian and gulabjamun with vanilla icecream!! Good service. Good ambience. Moderate price.<//text>

This is better than the Anjappar in Milpitas. Their Ceylon Parotta and Schezwan fird rice are good options to try.

But they once messed up my vegetarian order and served me chicken. This is a big no and hopefully does not happen again.< /review>

Also, the chiku milkshake is a delicacy at this restaurant.< /review><UserId.>109224736318502164881</UserId.><user_name>Mohit Goenka</user_name>< Rate>

One of the best Indian food in town.
Must try Kulipanyaram and Crab Masala

P.S I prefer Santa Clara over militias.< /text>

Lousiest service in bay area. Believe me i have been to a lot of restaurants around here. On a weekday I ordered and waited for 30 mins and then they tell me that they dont have the dish. i finally got served 15 mins later on a changed order. I ordered an extra chapathi, which they made me regret and arrived in 15 mins. I did not dare ask for a to go box. Also i did not wait for the check... I went to the register where they made me wait for 10 mins. The guy sitting next to me was awaiting a mango shake for i dont know how long.
Never going to this place again.<//review>

<Text>The food here was very average. I ordered Anjappar special chicken, the spice level was extremely high. The second thing I ordered was chicken noodles, which was below average because, I could find more of an egg than noodles and the chicken. It just didn't justify.<//Text><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

If you come to this place by 7:30-9:00, don't leave anything in your car because there's two young men that steels stuff, they break your window and gets all the stuff they can and they also drive a red car, so be careful< /review>
