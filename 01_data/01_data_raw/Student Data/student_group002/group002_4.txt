<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Today was my first time in Chinatown after living in LA for a couple years. Wandering about down the main drag I came upon this place. I checked the reviews and it seemed like a good place. It was Sunday, the restaurant was crowded, and the dishes through the window looked tasty.

I sat down and took a minute to find a soup that caught my eye. There were plenty, but the variety soup was what I pointed out. I also had the option of what kind of noodles, which I thought was pretty cool.

There was a hiccup in service here. First they lost my order, then they moved me to a different table. As a lone eater I understood the space thing, as I didn't choose the table but was told to sit there I was a little miffed, but not too much. The forgotten dish, being really hungry, sucked. But, after about 5 or 6 minutes my soup arrived at where I sat.

Overall I was really happy with what I ordered. The flavor, portions, variety, all were really good. And, the price was also on point, at $8 for the dish, which, in LA seems miraculous.

Next time I hear to Chinatown I'll probably check out a different restaurant, not because this place isn't good, I just have a feeling there might be better.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM83S9Rgfuyr-Kaxdy6zkIarG7SmmzFUJ-RB-tU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2c65af1a1ec63:0x1e71d80127a4a665< /gmap_id></record>

<Review>A little bit off the beaten track but easy to get to and in a nice neighbourhood. Great experience and delicious. It's a nice touch to be able to choose from a menu instead of the old cart thing. I don't get to enjoy dim sum often enough but I really liked their choices and preparation. Definitely recommended!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<username>Brianne Rogers</username><Review>The Leek Cakes are definitely something to try here, and I will definitely be back for them!! Service was also very good:) I got the veggie chow mein, and it was good, but I've definitely had better noodles. The boba wasn't very fresh, and it was all clumped together at the bottom of my thai tea, but the thai tea was good. Can't wait to come back here for those leek cakes!!</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
My favorite place in Chinatown! Bad service here is so bad that it's an institution in itself. The true mark of Chinatown, indeed. Who cares about service when the food is truly magnificent! And cheap, too. Go elsewhere to hand over all your hard earned $ for mediocre food with so much stuffy pretentions. This place is the place to go for an experience like no other in America! I personally have been coming here for 30+ years! Rain or shine, this Chu Jao place delivers! I love the soups, stir fries, steamed, and even the tea, which is free! Don't expect fancy, clean, 6 star service restaurant. This is a 7 star food joint for a true foodie, a must visit for some serious chow! Ignore the workers, and ignore all the unimportant stuff like decorations, vibe, food stains, unwiped spills. So what? Focus on the food. And the price. What a value! Love it!
Update: Now this place has boba drinks with hello Kitty tops! Used to be nice, now it's cute as well.
Up update: I don't know why so many people stand in line out side for over-rated spicy fried chicken sandwiches... This Kim Chuy is amazing, peeps. Still amazing after decades.</Review>

I really didn't like this place at all. I ordered a  no. 49 (chow mien with beef and broccoli). The look of dish was fine, nothing really too amazing. The viscosity of the noodles was too thick. It felt like slurping up mucus and the beef was too chewy. The broccoli was actually passable. Overall, I came in hungry looking for nice asian cuisine. I got sadness and a partially filled stomach.</Text>

< Review>
A very utilitarian Chinese restaurant. There is nothing fussy or romantic here...from the service, which varies depending whether you get the owner (a middle aged man with good customer service skills) or his father (less so)..to the decor and amenities, which are dated and involve wood and melamine. However, if you are wise, you look past all that; the food here is very good and, served in good portions. The prices are reasonable to good. I recommend their soups, of which there is a large variety and is their specialty. The fish, beef and pork balls are handmade here daily. They have a great variety of noodles to choose from. You can get various drinks from sodas to teas with boba.< /Review>

The food is good but what takes away from it is the service. Most of the servers don’t speak English or is hard to understand. Also the orders can get mixed up. We had the fried rice and beef soup. It’s a little salty but drink water and you’re fine. If you know that going in, it’s a good place to eat. Oh and don’t sit in the far corner. The servers won’t see you if you need anything. You’ll have to get up and go to them 😁</Review>

<review>A good restaurant for some Nam Vang noodles. Their chow mein with gravy is very tasty as well. Also their duck noodle soup is good. You don't have to wait long for your food as they are very speedy. On weekends, you might have to wait a little bit more than weekdays. Overall, if you want some good noodle soup, then this place would hit the spot.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

If you’re fan of soup noodles, then you should check out this place cuz - they rock!  Love coming here for my noodle fix, “item # 11 beef soup noodles- simply the best." The family run business has been at this for well over 30 years; they are quite consistent and you can opt to have dish prepared with noodles and soup or dry (soup broth separate.) Prices are reasonable and the taste is very authentic what more can you ask for.<//text>

I ordered a rice and it was supposed to come with beef, chicken and shrimps but I didn’t see beef on the plate and only four shrimps. The old woman that takes your order was kind of upset and worried only about making money.<//review>

I do believe their staff could have been more friendly and welcoming though.</text>

I'll think twice next time I'm craving Asian food..oh and btw my plate was the Seafood Chow Mein with Soft Noodle..I gave them a two star because im hoping it was just the different chef but the ingredients are different for sure..< /Review>< Pics>

I use Maps more for reading reviews rather than writing, but felt the place made enough of an impression for me to say something.

Visual:
Place came off as a little dingy. It looks neater in the photos rather than how it appears upon arrival. Not something I usually mind, but figured might as well mention it.
Service:
As others have mentioned, the people running the place don't exactly come off as the most hospitable. They were a little rude when ordering and requesting something as simple as an extra spoon.
Waiting time was reasonable enough until one of the orders seemed to take longer to arrive than expected. By the time everyone else was halfway done through their meals we asked about the order only to discover they forgot to make it altogether.
Another thing I noted was clothing attire. Wouldnt have hurt for them to wear something cleaner, considering they were handling peoples food. Again, not something I usually care for but on top of everything else, it didn't help much.
Food:
Going back to the delayed order, when it did arrive it looked like someone had drooled all over it. When picking up a peice it sort of left trails of slime from the food to the fork. After unwillingly taking a bite, I found the taste wasn't as bad as I feared but again the gooey-ness just made it off putting to eat.
Only good thing I have to say was the fried rice was a lot more preferable to eat, and was actually pretty good. Good enough that I give the place 2 stars instead of one.

Overall, not the best of experience. I'm rather disappointed actually, seeing as others here seem to have had a more pleasant stay here. Maybe I'll give them another shot sometime in the later future, but for now I don't find it worth taking the risk.
Should've headed to the places next to it that seemed more busy and crowded.<//review>

Kim's has been around for a stretch. If you have a hankrin' for Cinese fast food you will enjoy this place whether you eat in or take out. Don't be intimitated when they hand you the menu. It has pix and pricing. One day start by choosing a soup with your choice of rice noodles (thick, thin etc). The next time select a fried chowmein seafood dish. Either way, your tummy will thank you. ENJOY!< /review>

< Review>
If this place were to run out of business, I would cry. A part of me would be missing. I'm serious.

I've grown up on Viet, Chinese, and Teo Chow food. And this is the only place I go to to order the chive cake (Canto: Gao (like "dog") Choi (meaning vegetable) Bang (meaning pastry). It's a glutinous rice cake sort of thing with chives inside. They don't have it on the menu but they're about 80 cents each. I've tried it at many many other places and also tried to buy it frozen from supermarkets. NONE compare to this restaurant's. They also fry it for you upon request but I don't prefer that.

It also comes with really good fish sauce to pour on it. My mom tried to imitate it but was not successful and she can imitate most food we eat at restaurants!

TIP: I bring it home and if it's cold, I put a white paper towel on top of it and heat it up. Then I cut each piece in fours and pour the fish sauce on top. YUUUUMMMM.

But if you have braces.. esp clear ones, don't you dare eat this. The green chives will stick onto your brackets and if you try to take it off, the green will tint your clear brackets until you thoroughly brush your teeth! Sad two years when I had my braces and couldn't eat these without have a toothpick ready to save myself from social suicide.

Their noodles are good as well! The hieu tieu (the yellow noodles with soup, fish ball, meat, etc). YUMMM but I could get those anywhere as well hahah. BUT STILL SO GOOD!

and of course it's cheap bc it's located in 626 haha. Right across from noodle city!< /Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Every time I go to LA, I eat it back. It tastes good and is often full. My friend's attitude is a bit arrogant. Hygiene is also one of the improvement points.

(Original)
每次到LA都回頭吃的一間，味道不錯，經常人滿，伙記態度有點傲慢，衛生亦是改善重點之一。< /Review>

Need to Give Giselle a good review. She's always very helpful and did not fall short helping us with the details of moving units. I also want to leave a 5 star review for Dave as well. Any time we've had him come to our unit he has fixed whatever the work order was for, and anything else we brought to his attention. Hands down the best maintenance worker here!</review>

I'm currently in the process of ending my lease early and management has been no help at all. We have had multiple problems with roaches and mice and I wish I read the reviews prior to moving so I could see this issue. If your apartment isn't on fire, your maintenance requests will take days to get responded to (currently going on day 3 with no response or action since I submitted my last one). We had bikes on our patio because there is no where else to store them as the outside storage is not big enough and we get told nothing can be on our patio, THAT WE PAY A GENEROUS AMOUNT FOR, except patio furniture. Even the plant we had outside wasn't  up to their standards and they made us put it away. We had multiple issues with our upstairs neighbors and we brought it to managements' attention multiple times and nothing was done, and it got so bad that police were called..Not to mention our rent was raised almost $100 DURING A PANDEMIC. I am glad we are leaving  this lease early but not at the outrageous high price we have to pay, but like I stated management has been not much of help and they have been very cold and disinterested in our well being the whole 1.5 years we have lived here. The only good experience we had was when Flor helped us in the beginning to get the apartment, and the apartment size, but that's about it.<//text>

We have lived at Waterleaf for over a year, and have had a great experience here. If we have an issue, maintenance is on it. The employees always greet us when we cross paths, and the management team has been helpful and friendly. The property is well-kept and we enjoy walking around and using the amenities.
Since the beginning of Covid, the management team has gone a step above by organizing mini events, like virtual bingo, meal and ice cream giveaways to residents,  holiday decor contests, and an Easter egg hunt for the kids. They have really helped to brighten our days, and create a sense of community.<//review>

<text>My experience has been amazing at Waterleaf. From the moment I reached out to express my interest for a tour, I have been in consistent communication with either Flor, Tim or Brooke. I moved in during the pandemic, however, it did not stop Flor from meeting me outside to show me where the model unit was and provide some additional move-in details. As my move date neared she even reached out to offer me an apartment that better suited my needs as, she sensed my hesitancy with the original apartment location. As a pet-friendly complex there is a ton of green grass for my pooch, along with a well maintained dog park. I really enjoy that the maintenance team readily responds to requests in a timely manner and check-in to ensure everything is still up to par. I am satisfied with my decision to move out of San Marcos to Vista to this great community of apartments.< /text></record>

Over all I like this community, it’s pretty affordable for the square footage and while the residents can suck the maintenance is really nice. We had an ongoing issue with our electric that eventually evolved into us having no power at all, it took a few weeks and a few visits from maintenance to figure out the issue. Dave and Abel came out and ran some diagnostics and replaced the breaker, they were really nice and got along well with my dog :~)</text>

<text>Management has been very helpful and always responds in a timely manner with any questions or concerns I’ve had since my husband and I moved in a few months ago. Guisselle in particular has gone above and beyond when I’ve reached out for help with specific situations and I can’t thank her enough for being so kind and professional over the phone and via email when I reach out to management!</text>< Resp>

This review is for Joey! He’s part of the maintenance crew and he’s so great to have around.  He’s always been super helpful and professional even in this pandemic. He came with his mask, gloves and always remained a good distance away. Thank you Joey!<//Review>

RUN! THIS IS THE WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER LIVED AT. THERES MOLD EVERYWHERE AND RAT NESTS ON THE OUTDOOR AC UNITS. THE OFFICE ONLY RESPONDS TO NEW CUSTOMERS NEVER EXISTING ONES TO ADDRESS REPAIRS. WHEN I MOVED OUT THEY KEPT MY DEPOSIT AND CHARGED AN ADDITIONAL 500 DOLLARS FOR NEW TUB LINING AND DAMAGE CAUSED BY AN OLD KITHEN FAUCET. YVONNE FROM THE OFFICE PRETENDS LIKE SHE OWNS THE COMPLEX AND SQUEEZES PEOPLE FOR EVERY LAST DIME. SAVE YOURSELF THE BLOOD BOILING ANGER AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.</Text>

Thank you to Tim, flor, Joey and all the maintenance guys for handling business and a huge shout out to tim for helping me and taking care of me since day one! Staff and maintenance crew are respectful and friendly. Also as always an FYI if you’re rude to staff when they’re trying to help you just remember they’re doing the best they can to help you and your family as well as so many other tenets!

As he was completing each of the items he made me feel very comfortable as he would move throughout the house. He did this by giving me updates on what he completed and what his next steps were.

This place is full of roaches and terrible management, glad my family moved away from this place and I recommend you to find something else. Waterleaf was by far the worst apartment I have ever lived in. The maintenance staff was probably the only positive thing about the waterleaf.<//review>

Waterleaf Apartments has the best maintenance department I have had experience with.  With the exception of the understandable delays from COVID-19, The Maintenance Crew has always been quick and professional. I put my request in on Wednesday this week and Joey was here on Thursday. He managed to fix all three appliances I had issues with. The dishwasher, Washer and Dryer. They were solid fixes that didn’t require weeks of waiting for new equipment. Joey was professional, communicative and courteous.  He did not just find the source of the issues and repair them quickly. He explained what had happened and even thanked me for my patience during this whole thing.  Waterleaf Maintenance is definitely one of the Highlights I have experienced while living here.< /Text>

There are only two words to describe this place and its employees. Vile and inconsiderate. I moved out of this place months ago and it was the best thing that happened to me. If you haven't gotten the gist of it yet, the place has a massive roach problem and is rundown to a place of no return. Stuff got stolen constantly and staff does nothing, all they want is your money. This place is a whole malicious operation on its own, they try and trick you with a nice looking lobby and demo apartment and then boom, welcome to the underworld. Avoid this place like the plague, they only want every last cent they can fish out of you.<//Text>

The absolute WORST property management company I've ever rented from. Terrible customer service, rude staff, and practically predatory management.

The apartments themselves are subpar with paper thin walls and cockroaches. Wish I 'd read the other reviews before renting here.< /text>

We moved out and left the apartment in a very clean state and they still make me pay 600 dollars more on top of the 500 dollar deposit fee I gave them when I moved in. Roaches everywhere. Outside the apartment.. all of my neighbors smoked weed which is fine but the smell is right in your face. I couldn't even have my windows open. The pool and hot tubs where always dirty. The only good thing about this place is the washer and dryer in the unit. Other than that. Just buy a house.

<time>1591996419372<//time><rate>4<//rate><Review>Moving across the country was tough for my boyfriend and I (and our 2 dogs), but moving into Waterleaf was by far the best decision we made! We worked with Flor in the main office to get everything set up, and she was so patient and active in helping us get set up with a unit. We've been here for just about a year now, and it's honestly been one of the best places I've ever lived.

Pros:
-Really great units! They're a bit pricy, but for having a fan, AC unit (in the living room only), a dishwasher AND washer/dryer in unit was fabulous and completely worth it. It comes with an assigned parking lot spot, access to all their facilities, and a really great private patio. The master room is really big, and the master closet (in our 2 bed 1 bath unit) is the biggest walk in closet I've ever had.
-We have a ground floor apartment, which comes with 2 extra storage areas (one on the patio and one in the living room). It's great and super handy!
-I have to shout out to the maintenance team! We had Joey come to fix some dishwasher and sink issues, and he was so great! He went above and beyond, was super thorough, and even helped change a lightbulb (that I had no clue was dimming so much). Everyone in maintenance has been so great to us. The groundskeeping crew and workers are all so friendly and keep the complex looking great all the time! They all work really hard, and it shows.
-The facilities (when open, they've been closed for COVID recently for safety reasons, and I commend them on keeping resident safety at the forefront) are so fantastic. My boyfriend and I love going into their gym, and using the pool and basketball courts.
-There's a lot of great community involvement! The complex (usually once a month or so) hosts some kind of event or game for residents to participate in (for example, october was a pumpkin carving contest, and recently they've done in home scavenger hunts, bingo and even free pizza!). They're really focused on community, which is great.
-They allow dogs of all sizes, which is amazing!! We have 2 medium sized dogs, both labs, and it was tough at first to find a place that would allow 2 dogs (that are both over 50lbs). We have to pay a pet fee, but it's completely worth it. We've seen dogs of all sizes around, and it's great that the complex is very welcoming to our furry friends!
-There's a lot in the area around the complex. Downtown vista is just a few minute drive with great restaurants and a library. There's a grocery store in walking distance, and a lot of bigger name stores within a 5 minute drive. It's got great access to the 78, and is just an easy 15 minutes from the beach!
-Have I mentioned the in unit washer and dryer? Because that's a selling point on it's own, honestly.

Cons:
-We didn't realize it until after we moved in, but the only built in lights are in the main living room/kitchen and the bathroom (and master closet). It's not a huge deal, the windows let in tons of light, and we had lights we brought, but just be aware of it.
-Management has been proactive in trying to solve it, but there has been a lot of issues with irresponsible dog owners in the complex leaving dog messes everywhere. The dog park is especially bad. Again, that's not on the complex, it's on the irresponsible residents, but we did have to stop using the dog park because every time we wanted to go let our dogs run, we basically had to clean the whole thing so our dogs didn't step in or run through other dog messes.
-We did find roaches once in our apartment. We submitted a maintenance request, but didn't realize you have to go into the office to sign up for someone to come spray for them. They were diligent in coming out to spray after we signed up and it solved the problem immediately. There are other bugs, mostly spiders, but that's common anywhere.
-The rooms can get pretty humid sometimes, even with the fan and AC in the living room. We have a fan for each room and that helps to solve a bit of the problem.

Overall, we've had a really great experience, and we're looking forward to continuing to stay here!</Review><user_id>116599451269077986412< /user_id>< Resp>

DO NOT MOVE HERE!!!!
Terrible place, management and maintenance  is rude and unprofessional. They will give you attitudes and never call you back if you have an issue with your apartment. The living amenities are cheap and fall apart. Don’t fall for them saying they have “hardwood floors” it’s paper on top of concrete that easily rips up. Don’t even get me started on the roaches and their pest problems. I can’t even leave food on the counter for more than 1 hour without roaches coming out of the stove and crawling on our food. At night if you walk through the grass you will see HUGE roaches running out. This place is disgusting and needs to be burned down! They also need new management with their disgusting attitudes. I have talked to multiple neighbors around me and they are also having the same problem and they will not be releasing. Save your money and look somewhere else because if I could give this place less then one star I would, one star is being beyond generous.</review>

Terrible place, management and maintenance  is rude and unprofessional. They will give you attitudes and never call you back if you have an issue with your apartment. The living amenities are cheap and fall apart. Don’t fall for them saying they have “hardwood floors” it’s paper on top of concrete that easily rips up. Don’t even get me started on the roaches and their pest problems. I can’t even leave food on the counter for more than 1 hour without roaches coming out of the stove and crawling on our food. At night if you walk through the grass you will see HUGE roaches running out. This place is disgusting and needs to be burned down! They also need new management with their disgusting attitudes. I have talked to multiple neighbors around me and they are also having the same problem and they will not be releasing. Save your money and look somewhere else because if I could give this place less then one star I would, one star is being beyond generous.</Text></record>

STAY AWAY. I REPEAT, STAY AWAY!!

I'm writing this review at 2:30am on a Thursday night, I have work the next morning. The reason I'm awake? Well, 20 minutes ago.. I witnessed a man get jumped outside of my window by a gang of some fine gentleman, then 5 minutes later, my delightful neighbors come peeling into the parking lot, beers in hand, screaming and yelling, doing donuts in their beater vehicle that looks like if a cigarette was a transformer. There was a traffic cone stuck in what was left of their bumper, they tried for 10 minutes trying to pull this thing out while stumbling and yelling obscenities.

I am FINALLY moving out this Saturday and let me tell ya, it will be the greatest day of my life.

Waterleaf Apartments is the absolute worst apartment complex I have ever lived at, been to,
driven by, even thought about.

Three words: GHETTO, DANGEROUS, LOUD.

Here's a few of the amazing amenities Waterleaf Apartments offer!

Cockroaches the size of marshmallow peeps! Absolutely adorable!

The staff are mostly mouth breathers who think their poo doesn't stink, and talk to you like you are just a number. (with the exception of Giselle, she's actually very sweet and helpful). Tim is extremely rude, and he's about as helpful as an armless chimp doing sign language to the deaf.

Mold in the bathtubs! If you make a complaint about this, someone will come over (but not when you scheduled them to), and tell you to just clean it.

This one is a little redundant: The worst neighbors you could ever fathom. I mean, I get that this is a given when it comes to apartment life, but MY GOD. A lot of the people who live here are a special breed!

My girlfriend was actually stalked once when she went to get the mail! They added courtesy patrol, but they don't come when you call them. This usually resorts to having to call the Sheriffs to actually get anything done.

Animal cruelty happening in the complex. I witnessed a man kick and choke his dog, and run away when he caught me watching what he was doing. People also leave their dogs in kennels on the balcony so they bark throughout the night. They added a zero tolerance policy against this, but we'll see how well they enforce that.

People will open your packages.

NOBODY CLEANS THEIR DOG POOP. I hope you don't have any shoes that you care about because they're about to be cloaked in 50 Shades of Feces.

There is one apartment that the cops were there CONSTANTLY until they moved out.

One time, the woman in question smashed her head through a bedroom window, then had a standoff with the police asking them to kill her. There was blood on the sidewalk, but it added a splash of color to an otherwise depressing complex.

As a normal human being, I can tell you that this is unfit living conditions for people. I wouldn't wish that death sentence of a 12 month lease on my worst enemy.

This place is the fart of Vista, CA.

Alright, that's enough writing. I need sleep. I need peace and quiet. I need it to be Saturday already because I need to get THE HECK OUT OF HERE.

Wish I could give zero stars, but ya know.. I gotta give one by default. I hope this place shuts down.

Goodnight.

P.S. STAY AWAY, I'M BEGGING YOU. THEY GET YOU WITH THE PRETTY LEASE OFFICE BUT I SWEAR ON ALL THAT IS HOLY, IT IS A FRONT. ALL OF THE 5 STAR REVIEWS YOU SEE HERE ARE FAKER THAN KIM K’S REAR END.

but if you do move in, please bring a pocket knife or something with you when you take your dogs for walks.<//text>

I've been a Waterleaf resident for 2 years. I love the location of my apartment which is right by the pool and surrounded by big beautiful palm trees.
I've grown close to my neighbors who all look out for each other.

If I could give zero stars I would! THIS PLACE IS INFESTED WITH ROACHES!!!! Please go find somewhere else to stay. The office staff is very unprofessional and clearly don’t care. The paint in the apartment will start pealing within the first 3 months. Most importantly they HAVE ROACHES!!<//review>

<rating>1</rating><text>I would give this two stars based on price and size, but honestly I cannot.

I am a current resident and wanted to relay my experience so far.  They are amazing when you are trying to move in, since then it has been a nightmare.  The main staff has no empathy, resolution or care to even address your issues.There is a lack of communication, follow up, and remedy for many of the problems that my wife and I have had since we moved in.

We have been dealing with roaches since we moved in.  Sprayed and had other measures done since October.  We have had tried to get our front door fixed for 3 months now, it is allowing air as well as pests in.  They complete work orders when they are not complete.  If you put in a work order expect about a 2 week turn around. But the apartment above myself is getting a complete remodel, yet we still deal with bugs.

Last week someone set our dumpster on fire and when I contacted the emergency maintenance as a courtesy and the person sounded confused, they said they may look into it after an hour.  My neighbor put out the fire and called 911.

Honestly, if this is the only place you can afford go for it, but be warned ahead of time.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Waterleaf Apartments is a fantastic community not only the community though, however as well as the management team. First off the living space is amazing, the value is remarkable you truly get the bang for your buck and I mean this in a positive manner not to degrade quality. The gym is awesome full gym, the pools and jacuzzis and the pool area in general is a fantastic place to spend time in the summer, very similar-looking to a resort. Brook, the lead manager and Flor, both made my move enjoyable into my new apartment and I thank both Brook and Flor. Not sure what's up with all the negative feedback on social media however I can vouch that generally people don't tend to leave positive feedback they tend to leave negatives when they occur and I'm sure most of the negative feedback are mostly exaggerations without a doubt because this place is awesome. I'm a happy camper 😊.</Review>

Went in to Waterleaf apartments and was greeted with a smile from the very start. They was very professional and answered all my questions. I appreciated their promptness, efficiency and demonstrating the value of this residency. Customer Service in my opinion is a lost art, so it's very refreshing to have intellectuals who still know the importance of catering to their customer. I would by all means refer them to all of my peers.</Review>

I can't believe how expensive the utilities are for a 1 bedroom apartment. Outrageous. I've lived in 2 bedroom apartments in Shadowridge and it was never this high. We've already had maintenance issues that took forever to be addressed until management got involved. Noisy neighbors and the smell of dog feces everywhere. The move in process was horrible as no one would return a phone call and someone left a rude voicemail on our phone as well. I wish we weren't in such a hurry to find a place and kept looking.

Don't rent here. You'll be dissatisfied just like all of these other reviewers.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1537291851366, 'text': 'Caren,\nThank you for your review.

<Review>Save your money and your time. Never rent from MG properties or Waterleaf Apts. Office staff is rude and never helpful. Rent is outrageous for the quality of the apartments. Upon move out, they will scam you out of your deposit and not return your phone calls/emails. I lived here for a year and half and never had a positive experience here. I wish 0 stars was an option.

Worst experiance since before i moved in. Regret it now. So before i gave my 30 day notice to the property i was living at i jept calling Waterleaf Apartments. They kept saying yea it should be good. I just done have the final approval ect.... So i was leery about giving my notice. Finally they told me it was a for sure green light so i gave my notice to the property till the 30th of July because my move in date was set for july 23. In between that time i check out a demo appartment just like mine just to make sure i liked it. Now its 1 week before my move in so i set up my movers because i was not going to have anyone to help me as my move in is during the week. I called July 22 and spoke to Gizelle and asked when are they going to want me to pay them if my move in is tomorrow July 23 and no one had called me yet to schedule that. She said just to come in tomorrow July 23 any time the apartment is ready to go. I asket what time they open. She informed me 9am but she was off so Flor would take care of me. 8am my movers show up. I areived to waterleaf apartments just after opening and was attended by Flor. I paid my deposit and asked if we can do the walk thru quickly as i had the movers at my old apartment. As we walk up the maintanace guy phones her that there is a problem with the unit. We walked in and the appartment is gutted. The counter tops were not set in place. The appliances were not installed. The windows you can see the 2x4 frame. The bathrooms did not have anything in them. They told me they could have it ready by 3 p.m. that same day. So I ask them what's going to happen with the expense of my Movers because they are almost done packing my whole apartment. I stayed in the office speaking with the manager Brooke to find a solution to now my unnecessary expense for the movers. Meanwhile my family is waiting at my old apartment for an answer with no fans no chairs no sofas nothing to sit on. Just to let you know my son was four and a half months old at that time and it was a very hot day that day. 4 p.m. came and I didn't have a solution. I was forced to go back into the office where's my wife to find out what they were going to do for me since this whole time since 8 in the morning I'm being charged for the movers. Albrook said is that we can cancel the contract and just fine an apartment somewhere else. She did offer to move into a different unit that morning but it would still take about 3 hours to do the paperwork and I did not like the location. But they will still not compensate me for the extra hours the movers were waiting. I was forced to put all my belongings into a storage then wait another seven days tell that unit was completed. Till this day there has been nothing but issues with the apartment. Don't be fooled by the Beautiful demo apartment they show you. I asked multiple times for a mold test in the apartment because it smells very odd in there every time we leave and come back in. There is a lot of cockroaches which I did not have in my previous apartment. Multiple maintenance issues that have not been resolved to this day over a month later. Just for the movers I had to pay almost $800 and they refused to refund me back that money when it was their fault.</Text>

We’ve had issues with the people above us ever since we moved in with there music, stomping, yelling, cursing, obscenities and the constant pot smoking...so much that a lot of times we have to close our doors and windows because I don’t want my 11yr daughter smelling it.

I’ve complained to Mngmt numerous times and there quiet for a day then it’s back to normal the next day. They never follow up with anything and that’s most likely cuz they don’t care and that’s the way they make u feel.

Our apartment was not ready when we moved in being infested with cockroaches, broken mirrors and painting on the cupboards still needing to be done. But they sure had no problem collecting the rent and deposit upfront!!

I would think twice about moving here and with the complex open to the public there are always sketchy and shady people walking through and around. Even now as I write this on a Monday night at 8:40 pm the people above us are yelling, pounding and cursing. Not an ideal place to live for a family!!

As another reviewer wrote once GHETTO, LOUD & DANGEROUS are three words that describe this complex very very well< /text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! I've lived here for over 3 years and there are SO many problems with this apt complex! There's a MAJOR ROACH problem in all the apt buildings, there is no customer service from anybody in the office or maintenance (whenever I ask anybody for help, nobody will help!!!), they have changed management so many times (I can't even count the amount), when you call the office NOBODY answers no matter how many times you call, it takes maintenance over a week to come fix anything in your apt and they never arrive on time (wasting your time),  they don't unlock your apt if you get locked out, cars get broken into often, crime rate is high, and much more!

My family and I are very clean people and the management is forcing us out of our apt to spray our whole building because other people in my building have roaches. They make you take EVERYTHING out of your kitchen cabinets and countertops, as well as the bathroom, which is very time consuming! On top of that, I'm pregnant so I have to be out for 24 hours after they spray AND my dogs need to be out for the day as well. Meanwhile, the apt complex is NOT compensating us for anything.... Not even a days rent.. AND they are spraying more than once, which means double the amount of money that I don't have.

Everybody who works at this apt complex never greets you or smiles, even when you walk through the front door of the office, making it seem like they hate working here as much as the residents hate living here. Makes them look like they don't want to help anybody who walks through the office doors.

Like I said, don't waste your time. Look somewhere else, who actually cares about their residence!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1532019438801, 'text': 'Emily,\nThank you for your review.

You will be lucky to get one nice staff member if you have any questions.  The fleas are horrible.  The trees all over the grounds drop little fruits that you step on and end up staining your floors from.  They also attract flies and the entire area smells bad.  It is way overpriced for the quality of living in the apartments.  The paint on everything is extremely old and cheap, the appliances are all low quality, there is terrible lighting all the way through the unit.  It is constantly hot on the second floor throughout the day and the A/C can barely cool it down.  I would never live here again even if the rent was half of what they charge here.  I would not recommend this apartment complex to anybody.  Good luck folks.< /review><resp>None</resp>< pictures>

<review>I liked the apartment very much. However, the hidden fees and rude staff made our experience much more stressful rather than pleasant. They charge you for a carpet cleaning and repainting the whole place. I would understand if there was damage, but it was everyday wear and tear. And they charged me a couple hundred dollars for it. If you are late on your rent, they charge you 10% of your rent for the late fee. If I would have known about all of the extra money I would have to spend I never would lived here. Also, if you do decide to live here, I hope you have good insurance and be sure to lock your cars at night.< /review><user_name>mizellie12<//user_name><Rate>2<//Rate><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

ROACHES. ROACHES. ROACHES. Not exaggerating at all, these things are usually larger than an inch long. Also maintenance sucks. And anyone who knows how to jump a fence can get into the pools. They have “rules” but don’t enforce them. 10/10 would NOT recommend.< /Text>

We have had both happen to us! All Management does or says is "oh sorry". No increased security because who cares about your residents or their safety!!! This has happened to many other residents as well as bicycles etc. stolen from tenants porch. Waterleaf only has one person to patrol the huge community until 2 am that is not gated. So of course what happens between 2-5 am when most theft happens anyways? People's cars and vehicles get broken into and stolen. The police even told us that the Waterleaf community is notorious for theft! The management here is just horrible! I have also had other complaints that they have taken months to resolve as well. Plus they seem to care more about towing their own clients vehicles then they do about avoiding theft from their tenants/customers!!!! Tim is the worst too! I have been a homeowner in my home state and have rented it out and have rented myself at numerous other places in the past and this is by far the only and worst encounter I have had renting! AVOID at all costs. Not worth it!</Review>< UserId.>

No safety ,no security at all. someone broke my BMW in the night and put the knife in the right rear tire,then a day after someone stole all my shoes from mypatio. maintenance is worst than everything. Since  I moved here, almost a month ago, I asked them to fix my dishwasher and something else, who cares !!!!?
Very very low water pressure, sometimes I cant even take shower
I really got regret. GOD DAMN IT

My hatred for this place is a 1-star, but overall, I would have to call this place a 2-star rental based on the lower prices, close proximity to the freeway and shopping, and available guest parking.

Don't let the lush trees and upgraded pools fool you, living here sucks. I made the mistake of not researching the neighborhood before moving. This is one of the highest crime rate areas in Vista. I see cop cars responding to calls here on a weekly basis, several times I've seen/heard police helicopters overhead looking for someone, my roommate had a pack of military gear stolen from our patio closet, both my roommate and I have both had license plates stolen off our vehicles and 9 months later, my surfboard was stolen as well (all separate incidences). Several times a day, homeless people go through all the dumpsters looking for recyclables and there's nothing more scary than going out at night and opening the door to the dumpster area and see a person standing there.

Half the people that have dogs here don't clean up after them, resulting in poop in every grassy area. The air-conditioning units in each apartment sucks and will hardly keep the living room cold, let alone the rest of the house. The sprinkler system breaks a lot resulting in water being sprayed directly into your window if you're not safe. On the hot days, the pools are constantly full of screaming kids who have no respect for others at the pool and the parents don't really seem to care.

I was working on my car, (because that's what men in America do) and the next night, I received a call saying they were going to tow my car in the morning if I didn't stop working on it. I read through the lease agreement again and saw that it was stated that I'm not allowed to be doing that which is fair enough, but I feel like a nice courtesy call reminding me that I wasn't allowed to do that would have been sufficient rather than going straight to threats.

The inside of the apartment is horrible as well. There are no lights in the bedrooms, the switches on the walls (which are supposed to control one of the outlets in the rooms) do nothing at all; there's 3 light switches in the apartment that literally don't do anything. In the summer, fruit flies come out of no where and invest your house (believe me, my place was clean, they just show up. I've talked to other neighbors who had the same problem). The dishwasher was a joke, you pretty much have to wash off most of the food items on your dishware before putting them in the dishwasher. The washer/dryer are the smallest things in the world, I'm talking like, 3 pairs of pants, 2 shirts and some underwear and it's full. The toilet water pressure was crap, it would hardly flush. There's no microwave included in the unit. The patio outside is always dirty because the trees above it would dump dust and leaves and branches constantly. I was told that I couldn't put plants in pots on top of the ledge of MY patio because it "looked messy" (these were normal, green leaf plants inside a ceramic painted pot...). Paint on the cabinets would peel all the time. The fridge, freezer, oven, sink, and stove all worked fine though.

The low prices and location of this complex just seems to attract a certain group of people who have no respect for others around them. For the time that I lived there, about half of my neighbors have been "bad" neighbors who seem to think no one else exists in this complex, resulting in loud, obnoxious families. I moved out this week and couldn't be happier. Don't live here, there are better options.</text>

<text>Lived here for a couple of years and finally had ENOUGH!!! This place is very over priced and not even worth it. Maintenance is so inexperienced that I could probably do a way better job than they do. The staff is by far the most careless people I have ever dealt with. Lately these apartments have become infested with cockroaches and rats. If you’re looking to move here, think twice and do your homework. But if you don’t mind paying $1750 and live with rats, cockroaches and car thefts then this is the right place for you.< /text>< Rate>

I hated this place. The first night we moved in the water heater was messed up, which took all night to fix so no showers. We also found 3 huge spiders just on the first night. Later someone keyed our truck twice, the first time a friend of ours had run the kids off but the office people didn't believe us. Our neighbors screamed at 0200-0600 every morning telling each other to get up and the walls were thin. Another neighbor tried very hard to sleep with my husband and our friend who is married as well. The pools are dirty and nasty all the time. When we moved out they decided to charge us an extra 800 dollars for stupid stuff but we couldn't do anything about it. The rent of this place was on "special" for us and it still cost too much. I will never go near this place again.<//Text>

I currently live in them and they are absolutely terrifying. I could go on for pages on how unprofessional their staff is. They act extremely nice to you, of course, when they want to sell you the place and once you're suckered into the contract they are extremely rude to you. Don't get me started on how the dumpsters are ALWAYS full, overflowing to the ground, the sinks ALWAYS leak underneath causing a disgusting mildew smell, the AC hardly even works and even 4 box fans doesn't even remotely help the heat. The washer and dryers are pitiful. They cause your apartment to be even more humid and hot. They are difficult to even start. I must add that they only fit MAYBE an outfit or two inside of them... One loud takes over an hour to wash and it takes two sessions of 60 minutes for the dryer to dry the clothes.  The showers pour out barely any water causing your hair to have leftover shampoo and conditioner. I'm more than disappointed with Waterleaf apartments. They make an excuse for everything. Maintenance is what they claim to be SO FAST.. Yet, you wont see a maintenance man for days and they say their was an error. I would highly recommend not moving here. It's a huge mistake. I wish I would have listened to everyone but I was stubborn. Anyways, this place does have a lot of potential but unfortunately I don't foresee anything being fixed especially when you can't get rid of a rude staff and unwilling owners that won't change for the positive. You should DEFINITELY look at your carpet before moving in. Waterleafs apartment doesn't change the carpet for probably a decade. Our carpet is nearly black and I wouldn't be surprised if they tried blaming that on us. ALWAYS TAKE PICTURES WHEN YOU FIRST MOVE IN... It will help you in the end.< /text>< name>

These apartments are absolutely horrible. Staff are the most non caring people, you look for help and information and they are no help at all. The Roach infestation is horrible the crime is horrible courtesy patrol here is a joke everything about this apartment complex couldn’t be worse. Few months in and I’m already getting ready to just pay just to break the lease, it’s not even worth staying for the rest of the lease.</Review>

<review>First off these apartments are extremely overpriced, it's located in a bad neighborhood right by a street that always has bad traffic and speeders. Not only that but I've seen so many drug busts go down I'm sure the cockroaches that live there cook meth too.
The staff are rude, unorganized and overall snobbish.
All the apartments are very small and ALWAYS dirty.
I would not recommend this place to anyone!< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Where do I begin I lived here two years ago they lure you in with a beautiful office. You meet Tim and feel right at home before you ever sign a piece of paper. That's where the good things end. My wife and me lived there a year and a half before I left the military. It's way over priced, maintenance is awful You know what really was the final straw you pay for a parking stall assigned to you. It's not cheap either you are handed a card move in day to call a tow truck company if some one parks in your spot. Coming home late one night me and the wife pull in to our parking lot and some one is parked in our spot. Not a problem called the tow company they told me once the office closes they won't tow away a car because the office told them not to. Pissed of now I called the rent a cops that the complex hired to patrol they tell me they can't tow away either. Then told me to park on the street if he is still there in the morning then we will ticket him and tow it away. You pay for a spot that is not really yours unless it's office hrs after that any body can park there. I asked the owner to explain why I pay for a spot that is not leagaly mine after 5pm and they ignored me every single time I would ask until I left a few months later  Roaches were a constant problem ants in my shower the AC unit is a small unit that can barely cool the living room unless you want a 300 dollars  bill from sdge bottem line don't give these crooks your business go somewhere else<//review></record></dataset><record>

These apartments are infested with roaches and even after having pest control came in numoerous times they don't go away at all, they come out while I'm cooking and even get on my bed and my babies crib, it is disgusting. Management does not care, all they say they can do is just keep spraying. When I moved in I was told my apartment was newly remodeled and had no history of roaches but the second I walked in after I received the keys i saw damage on the floor, cabinets, and walls. Meintenance does not know how to do their job properly, they took over a month to patch up my walls after there was a water leak and they ended up braking the bottom of the bathroom cabinet. It's a horrible place I DO NOT recommend to anyone.<//Text>< response>

They made us leave for pest control for 24 hours and did not compensate us. STIll had to pay that days rent and get a hotel for my pregnant wife. Also, had to board our 2 dogs. NOWW, They are telling us we have to leave again for another 24 hours. When we ask about Compensation for the hotel and dog boarding, they tell us they can't compensate us even though they kick us out our apartment...... At one point they started charging us $30 extra for valet trash service that we didnt use.

< Review>
The worst apartments I have lived in. After numerous times having the apartment fumigated for roaches and deep cleaning on a bi-weekly basis to eliminate or reduce the infestation, they still come crawling out. We spent almost $3,000 in new furniture when we moved in to Waterleaf only to have to trash it when we leave so the possibility of transferring roaches to our next apartment is at a zero. We asked to leave the apartment / terminate the lease because of the constant problems and have our lease taken over by a new tenant because we were not happy and they insisted that the $2000 penalty would be implemented even in a situation where they neglected to inform us of the roach problem and possible mold in the apartment from the leaks.

Poor ethical procedures.<//Review>

<text>By far worst place we have moved into. We had to break our lease because we got orders to Okinawa Japan. They wanted us to pay the next months rent even thought we had moved out half ways through the previous month. They ended up sending us to collections. They do not work well with military families. It was a nice apartment from the inside. Once we had been living there for two months our car was broken into and valuables were stolen.</text>< Pictures>

This apartment complex is probably the worst place I've lived and I wish I would have taken the reviews more into consideration. In the 3 months I've lived here I've never had more problems take place.
The roaches and having Orkin come every month is a hassle. The mailboxes being "Upgraded" caused almost a 2 week delay in receiving any type of mail during tax season was the biggest pain in the ass. The post office couldn't help because management at the apartments didn't notify the post office in advance to allow them to order new locks. I wouldn't recommend leasing here. Paying the extra few hundred dollars a month for another complex in San Diego will be worth your money and the headache.</review>

Roaches were a constant problem, parking is horrendous, and terrible ventilation in the bathroom caused constant mildew. When we moved out, we were charged to repaint the entire apartment. We lived there for 1 1/2 years, non smokers, and only hung paintings in 1 room. All the other walls were untouched and didn't need repairs. I called to speak with someone about the charge and no one returned my call. I had to pay it because they sent it to collections. Would never recommend this place<//Text>

DO NOT COME TO WATERLEAF APARTMENTS! Been here for 7 months and had my car broken into last night on sep 26 as well as my neighbors. It’s overpriced and there is always ants and roaches no matter how clean you are! The management sucks! All they can say is “I’m sorry” that happened. And tell you it’s 2000 dollars to break your lease! I’m telling you! Take your money elsewhere.</text>

Lived here for 2 years had 4 break-ins on my vehicles. Waterleaf appartments are in a really shady place of vista. Yes, they have cleaned it up and made it look nice but that doesnt stop the crimes going on here. The apparment staff/management do not care. The apartments have cockroaches that come out at night aslo. I'm a clean person but the cockroaches will end up in your house, no matter how clean you are. If you don't constantly have traps or spray to prevent them, you'll end up with them.</review>

<text>This complex is horrible.  I have lived here twice, thinking it was better the second time around. I was SO wrong.  They show you a model then rent you something without the upgrades.  Show you a full size W/D and then give you a mini-stackable that breaks regularly.  The secondary pool that is NOT in the area you see when touring, is always a mess and the hot tub has been broken for two months.  I am counting down the days until we can get out of this place, only 45 more days....  So update, we have moved and they are charging me almost $800 to move out, they say all the walls need painted and the cabinets, I plan to go by and see the "work" that was done, because I do NOT believe what they said.

< Review>
This my second lease with Waterleaf and I can agree with some of the reviews, but I am not so easily enraged as some people are. There were some hiccups, but eventually everything evened out.

First lease was 9 month lease. They did show my cousin and nice model and told us it would be the same, but as soon as we were about to finish the application process, our proposed unit was then taken. We were not informed the next was not going to be furnished. That was a bummer.

The full size washer and dryer that originally came with the unit was my biggest irk w/Waterleaf.
The washer and dryer looked very old. The dryer's spinning mechanism was broken from before we moved in and could not dry anything. Even more worse, a connection was broken/not setup properly, so the entire carpet area in front of the Dryer and down the hall between the bedrooms was flooded! After a full few days of drying, the carpet was replaced. They then replaced the old washer and dryer and gave us a new stackable washer and dryer. These worked without issue were very happy to wash our clothes. Yes, do not put a heavy duty load of denim and towels...let's be reasonable about how much crap we put in before we complain about performance.
Oh and to add, my first unit did not direct the dryer heat/lint outside. Dyer did make the living area pretty hot and humid, but opening the Window was helpful.

Insects/Critters/etc - Clean when we came in. Over our 9 month lease however, I killed 5 cockroaches (4 inside, 1 outside on the walkway). In my opinion, not an issue. I didn't find heaping loads of the guys and managed to put a few traps down, but it's an Apartment, it's going to have some. Not a issue.

Amenities - Two pools. 1 by the main leasing office is nice and well decorated with flora. The other is towards Grapevine and looks completely opposite. It's not very attractive as it's bare! Add some trees or something to spruce the look of it. Not an issue, walk an extra block and enjoy the main pool.
However, over the past 4-5 months, the lock on the Gym door does not recognize the Key FOB after a certain time (haven't confirmed a time). The only way to get in is for someone on the inside already working out to let the door open for you. To avoid this, I have been putting something to block the door from closing so others may use until Closing time (10pm) and the social rule seems to be spreading.

Pantry Closet - This is very odd and confusing and I am not sure I believe the response I received on this. With our first place, the tiny pantry closet had shelves. Awesome. Fast forward 9 months to our new apartment (we moved from 2br/1ba to 2br/2ba), we open the Pantry and noticed no shelves! We asked Tim what the deal was and he stated that shelves are not included in the Pantry (Broom closet is what I like to call it, what else is the point without shelves?). By his response, the shelves in our last unit were from the previous Owner. If that's the case, Waterleaf would have ripped the shelves out to return the Pantry back to it's original state before we moved in the first time. So...do I get shelves? We'll find out soon!

It hasn't been 30 days since we moved out the first time so I cannot comment about our deposit and the status of it. What I am told is Waterleaf is looking to remodel all their old units (Linoleum floors, better looking pantries...what the Models look like). If this is true, I would assume that any carpet cleaning or cabinetry would not be deducted from my deposit as they're remodeling...but we'll see.

Stealing - 9 months and no issue with stolen goods from my unit or car. I kept my car in the unmarked parking stalls and in my provided spot as well. Of course, I do not keep valuables in my car and if I had to, I am not an idiot to keep valuables in plain sight.

Neighbors - It's not the leasing offices fault for unruly neighbors. I had some great neighbors, and towards the end, terrible ones as well. In the end, people were more on the friendly side vs the unfriendly.

All in all, not a bad place. Bring fans and a screen door</Review>

(Translated by Google) It is a great complex of apartments, I have to say that the maintenance staff is very friendly and they immediately respond to anything that needs repair, and I also want to mention that the mangers are very friendly and responsive to your needs. It is also a very quiet area to live with the family and has markets, schools, gas stations very close ..

<Review>Cool dive tikki bar. Spicy Lumpia is great. For a funky take on a shot with a chaser order Tequila with Kimchee juice back. Not for everyone but I liked it. Bartender was super friendly and fun.< /Review><GmapID>0x808580f3d0291d63:0x4abdc92693a8352f</GmapID>< Resp>

The roommate's cousins were only in town for a day or two. They wanted to go to Tonga Room, but unfortunately, it's closed on Tuesdays. As an alternate, I suggested Smuggler's Cove. I've never been here, but it seemed like the logical backup. We got here on March 8th a little before 6pm.</Text>

We had an alumni gathering for 10 there for lunch. Setup/service: impeccable. The items on the expansive menu were universally praised by our  guests. The bucata, meatballs and mushroom chicken, my dishes, were exceptionally well prepared. While small, the space is well laid-out and comfortable for groups of various sizes. There is plentiful street parking nearby and five free of charge spots directly in front of the restaurant.< /Text>

Best food I’ve ever tasted! I mean really, you will never taste Italian food as scrumptious as this. The waiters are amazing, the ambiance is impeccable, and the wine in divine. The restroom is great and it smells like a field of wildflowers. In conclusion 12/10 would recommend! I can eat here every day for the rest of my life and never get sick of it. Thinking of it just makes my stomach rumble.< /Text>

<Review>..... A pretty good dining experience. The service here was good and the food, while not being the best Italian I've ever had, was edible and satisfying. And of course the service was above average
The ambience was the thing I liked the most! Thanks Portofino.< /Review><rate>4< /rate>< Name>

<review>I, ll make it short and simple
Location is great
Longtime a go was very nice..
.today...
Their Italian accent is fake...  Stupid actually
Their food is ridiculously cheap
The price is reduculsly expensive..
The food portion is joke
The attitude and service is zero..
Never ever going back.
I would have posted a negative star if I could...
Worse experience ever...
I got embarrassed taking my guests there<//review>< userid>

<text>This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Los Angeles...hands down. I've been here twice for a girl's night out. The staff is great. The food, sublime. We were served right away and for the couple of hours that we were there, we were treated like we had been invited to someone's beautiful home for an authentic Italian dinner.

<review>We were in Santa Monica for the LA Marathon last week and decided to try this place after the race.  While the food was good (when we finally received it -- 1.5 hours after being seated), I can't think of anything redeeming to say about this experience.  It was extremely overpriced for the amount of food served (we literally laughed out loud when the $15 caesar salad was delivered).  As mentioned, it literally took 1.5 hours to receive the entrees and the wait staff never once stopped back to check in on whether the food was acceptable.  The bread was sub optimal too, but we were so hungry we ended up eating about 10 baskets of bread before the entrees were served.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>It was amazing. We were visiting LA and were lucky to have found Locanda Portofino, in Santa Monica, Ca. It is a cozy place and the food was superb. The best Vitello meal ever and my wife's gnhochl was espetacular. The flavor of their meals truly elevated our expectations going forward to unmatched levels. Thanks also for the dedicated services by all their staff members. Manny Karamanolis - Jupiter, Florida.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Time>1546358935796< /Time>< userid>

This used to be an outstanding restaurant but in the past six months has significantly declined. To be more specific, the service takes much longer, food is brought out irregularly so that one person will get their food while the other may wait as much as 20 minutes.  The chicken was tough, difficult to cut and chew, the sea food salad was clams, shrimp in a simple bowl, boiled and served with nothing more to suggest a salad or any other dish.  They simply threw the shellfish into a boiling pot and served it.  The price was ridiculous for such a minimal meal.  This review is based on four visits to the restaurant subsesquent to their decline, hoping that it would improve, but it has not.  Others who have eaten here in the past, all feel the same way.  They need to change management.</text>

We went to this lovely, buzzing restaurant with a beautiful ambiance...it was like being in Italy. The food was outstanding & the Barolo wine relaxed us!! We met the owners who made us very welcome, the staff were very efficient & attentive. A family operated business. Authentic italian cooking, i know because that’s the italian flavours. We will make this our local dinner place. Best Wishes to these hardworking people.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<rating>2< /rating><review>(Translated by Google) This place was once proudly shown to me by an acquaintance ... they say, you say there is no good Italian cuisine in LA - and so there is. In the same mood, I brought my friends here. Unfortunately, everyone was extremely disappointed. The food was carried for an hour. Risotto digested to a sticky rice porridge. In the mushroom risotto, at least the sauce was good, the risotto with seafood and sand was not brought to taste. $ 29, it turns out, is just rice porridge. As far as I understood, these “Italians” didn’t hear what “aldente” is. Having ordered food, I clarified to the waiter several times that everything needs to be cooked "aldente", in the end everything was absolutely the opposite. At our remark, the manager waved his hand and left. The waiter didn't listen to us at all. No “I'm sorry” and no suggestions to change. Even American smiles did not wait. Perhaps they do not appreciate new guests, since the restaurant is about 20 years old, well-to-do people of the age go there, who order very expensive wines and love such "porridge"? The service is included in the bill, 20% for all this !!!! Never come back here. I am sure that they will not be upset :)) but I also insisted that our company did not leave a tip. I think grandparents from the surrounding expensive houses will compensate them for the damage.

Это место когда-то давно гордо показал мне один знакомый...мол, ты говоришь нет в ЛА хорошей итальянской кухни - так вот здесь есть. В том же настроении я привела сюда друзей. К сожалению, все остались крайне разочарованы. Еду несли час. Ризотто переваренное до состояния липкой рисовой каши. В грибном ризотто хотя бы соус был неплохим, ризотто же с морепродуктами с песком и не доведено до вкуса. 29$, получается, стоит просто рисовая каша. Что такое «альденте», как я поняла, эти «итальянцы» вообще не слышали. Заказав еду, я несколько раз уточнила официанту, что приготовить все нужно «альденте», в итоге все было абсолютно наоборот. На наше замечание менеджер махнул рукой и ушёл. Официант вообще не стал нас слушать. Никакого «I’m sorry” и предложения поменять. Даже американских улыбок не дождались. Возможно, они не ценят новых гостей, так как ресторану около 20ти лет, туда ходят зажиточные люди в возрасте, которые заказывают очень дорогие вина и любят такие «кашки»? Сервис включён в счёт, 20% за все это!!!! Никогда сюда не вернусь. Уверена, что они не расстроятся:)) но и я настояла, чтобы наша компания не оставляла чаевых. Думаю, дедушки и бабушки из окрестных дорогих домов компенсируют им ущерб.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>YES, finally it is open. The food tastes mostly pretty good and so with the soup base. But the downside is that the service is way to slow and people there are very forgetful. Oh yeah, NEVER be after 6 because then the 15% will be gone and you will need to wait in a long line. Always eat all you can eat expect when u only eat one plate of food. Hope u enjoy.<//review>< Pics>

I have been here a few times and usually never have a problem, the food is great. However this occurrence was of the less pleasant. Our order was messed up and we got the other tables food and they got our food. We waited over 30 minutes for our food to come back out and ate all the appetizers and were to full to eat anymore.</text>

<rating>3</rating><review>So, I visit this place a week ago, and it wasn't as good as the other times I've been to in the original San Francisco location. I was surprised, as this location had just opened, but we were going in the low part of the week and the staff seem to be having difficulty prioritizing certain things, like getting us menus, getting our order, refilling our soup. my wife does really like this restaurant, and her other experience here with her friends was better. I hope that when I come back, I can improve my assessment.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

It just open and is busy as heck. Been there three times already. Good food and service. All you can drink is awesome. I wish there were more meat, broth and sauce options though.<//Review>

<Review>Expensive (as to be expected for all you can eat shabu) and delicious! Good meat quality, yummy fresh veggies and soup broths (we had spicy miso and chicken ginger). The table favorites were the kobe beef and the shitaki mushrooms. Fast for the day so you have a big appetite when you checkout this treat yourself spot for an early dinner (happy hour is 5-6pm). Dont forget to save enough room for the red bean and green tea ice cream at the end.<//Review><GmapID>0x808f8f9687055555:0x583c297e54fb9e3d< /GmapID><name>Dan Mehler<//name><resp>None</resp></record>

< Review>
I took my family here and we had a great time. We were seated toward the back. The table had 2 burners and so we figured we would do the ginger chicken broth and the spicy miso. It turned out they had dividers for the pots so we did half and half for both. It turns out we all liked the spicy miso the best. They had great prices and we did all you can eat so didn't have to worry about portion sizes. We also tried the gyoza which was really good as well. I definitely recommend this place and will be back.</Review>

<text>Great place to chill and have a beer.  There's  an outdoor tented patio where you can enjoy food and drinks.  I highly recommend the coffee stout and the double black IPA called Night Crew.

Because of covid, you need to order something to eat in order to get the goods.  They're cool about it and allow you to order at nearby pizza, vegetarian, sushi, or Mexican food in order to qualify for a beer order, just show them your receipt which is required. Cheers!!

<Review>Cool brewery. They automatically get 5 stars for the cool skate decks used as the beer menu. Outstanding idea.  As for the beer, good stuff. I’m definitely a IPA drinker but I tried there red and was impressed. Went about 3 and the place was packed.   Definitely be back next time in the OC.  Aloha</Review>< GmapID>

Great beers.  IPAs predominate and are some of the best in SoCal.  They also usually have a stout, brown ale, blonde, red and seltzer, all of which are well made and tasty.< /Text>

This small brewery kicks out some tasty beer.  You must currently order food, if you plan on drinking beer here.  They have ample, socially distanced outside seating.

I came home today with a 32oz. Crowler of one of their Hazy IPA's-Playa Nublada, a 7.0 ABV brew.  It was delicious.< /text>< Pictures>

Super relaxed friendly place right across the street from the beach. Loved the different size options as it lets you try a few from their great selection! Lots of pale and blonde ales.</text>

I love absolutely love this brewery. It is my go to place because they have some of the best beer in the area if not the state. They are constantly changing their rotation and creating new beers. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area. Amazing service.< /text>

Stopped by to grab a growler, hoping to try some of their GABF award winners but they weren’t on tap. Got a Bob in the Fog and it was a deliciously juicy and hazy double IPA that put me in a fog. Can’t wait to come by for a pint or flight and try some other beers!< /text>

<date>1543989224336< /date><Rate>5< /Rate><review>I’ve been coming here for years and the beer keeps getting better. Great place to stop and have a brew before getting out to the beach for sure. We started a few nights here before having appetizer dates down in Sunset.

The brewery just did some nice upgrades. Expanded next door and brewing on site. Patio seating. Dog friendly. IPAs for dayz yo.

Give the Supercali a try for your first round. Sample the rest. Always changing.

Tip: Order some Supermex. Guacamole and Chips when drinking!<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrHcuqS5RynYSdvKq6M-ckmaMIWNl0h_-fx5CJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUgp34mUI1IafY5q2VHEfSC6bvvZy2ShticPN4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIQniA0a5eb8KR6ulKaVKXw4EsTL01kF8NMppY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhj5RFLhy1RhmO3wtTDsHyFKG4tNqgLRwsYs0s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXIK0qpPN4OqdOPvJseMUjSVb2d7i-xy6b_9Mv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHVxo4jDwDJrCRh2ym0W0_UYU9EN74XfHe5A0O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrTFOfCiGngCYOfIQCukb1aoyQZb6vieMpaLsT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

Oh, I seen him walkin'
On down that road
He got a broken push cart
With a heavy load
Oh, Lord have mercy
Upon my wicked soul
Ah, he looked right at me
With his eyes of coal

It's the hoodoo operator
Hoodoo operator
Hoodoo operator
Hoodoo operator

Ah, he'll sell you liquids
To cure that whooping cough
And fine liniments
At a poor man's cost
Ah, but when your time is up boy
And you feel that chill
He will come softly knocking
To collect his bill

It's the hoodoo operator

Oh, I seen him walkin'
On down that road
He got a broken white man
With a heavy load
Oh, Lord have mercy
Upon my foolish soul
It is so cold and dark
Behind these eyes of coal

It's the hoodoo operator

First experience on the Pacific Ocean started here. Couldn't have been better. Best IPA I've ever had, almost like a juice, and the best staff and locals you could ask for. Definitely visit if you're anywhere near Huntington Beach.</review>

This is an amazing brewery. The staff is always awesome and they always have a good selection of beer. I haven't had anything I didn't like but they definitely have a good selection of IPA and Double IPA. I also tried an Amber here once that was probably the best Amber I've ever had. Their beer rotates so there is always something new to try.< /Review>

<Review>Rad beer place right next to Sunset Beach. The skateboard menu is sweet, as is their obvious love for hazy IPAs. We went late on a Monday, and it wasn’t too full, plenty of tables to chill at, I’m sure on busier nights it gets pretty full. Dudes working were great, and we enjoyed ourselves! Check it out.</Review>< pictures>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>We really enjoy this place. It’s at the corner of Warner and PCH. Parking is convenient and free. The brews are fine and they offer a great selection. The Krimson Killa is my favorite. Strong With a bite.

They are dog friendly as most tap rooms still are. Mia loves coming here, especially when it’s hot outside. We  love ordering food from the local restaurants. You can order via phone and walk to pick up. Some may deliver. They have park benches inside. If you have a sharpie you can graffiti on them. This is where we sit when the outside weather is bad. On nice days or evenings, sitting in the patio is an option.

The brew tanks are next door. According to legend, they had to use helicopters to lower the tanks into the room! They are huge! The brewers are happy to share brewing tips, when they aren’t busy creating a new batch.</Review>< userid>

If you are a fan of amazing micro brews look no further. RIIP Beer company features delicious small batch beers and their staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. Had the Oat of this World Stout and the wife has the Sessions IPA. Both of us came away happy. The best part? They deliver their beer to your door!!!!

They also actively supporting home brewing and have all the materials to try your hand at it.< /review>

They also have an outside patio and like most breweries, are dog friendly! They also do crowler and growler fills (they even will fill blank growlers or other brewery growlers, they just cover up the logo). You can even catch a glimpse of the ocean from the patio.< /review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dd25a7dc28ed41:0xc707161fa0a5ab0d< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Wide variety of IPAs including fruit and floral notes. There was a single coffee stout on tap with a surprisingly light finish. Dog and kid friendly. Although only light snacks are offered, they invite and welcome food from surrounding businesses - sushi, mexican, american, etc. It's a great place to hang out watch PCH traffic and meet new friends while with your current ones.< /Text>< Pics>

But I have no negative comments because it was 2 days before Thanksgiving no one wanted to cook after all the prep for the holiday.

Decent pizzas at a good price. I went in to order and they brought the pizzas out to my car a few minutes later. Employee was very friendly.</Text>

<text>My poor review is due to the lack of employees who seem to know what their doing which is a reflection of poor management and poor training. This place has had so much turn over in employees we see new faces every time we go in, whoever owns this establishment needs to invest in who they hire and give them proper training they are not dumb but if you don’t equip your staff with the skills they need, they can only do so much on their own. Also not sure how you cannot make 5 cheese bread if you have dough and cheese but we were told it wasn’t possible and that they were out. Oooookay then. Seem to be out of ingredients a lot, again poor management of establishment not taking inventory into account for ordering ingredients.</text>< Pics>

Went to Mckinleyville Papa Murphys for a gift card, and the staff could not issue it. Gave them cash and a card to use, whichever was easier, and they could not do it. They were rude on top of it, despite the fact they are the ones who are incompetent.<//text>

Well, usually pretty good but not today. Ordered a pickup for 3 an hour early but had to wait 20 minutes . seems 1 person does all the work and not enough of her to go around. Very inefficient sad to say, but employees very nice<//review>

I will never go back to this pizza place.  I have only been there twice but I had to wait 45 minutes both times. It could have been delivered and eaten in the time they made it. I will say the workers were very nice and working hard. There system is broken.</Review>

Best ever Pizza!  Cowboy and Pappa's combo are so amazing in either thin or regular crust.  Employees are always friendly. Great salads and the price is amazing.< /text>

I love Papa Murphy's, it's nice to get a take and bake for when I get home. Just pop it in the oven and 18 minutes later you got a tasty pizza to enjoy.</text>

This pizza chain is fine, although it just doesn't compare to pizza made by others instead of baking it yourself. If you're really trying to save cash and you just HAVE to have pizza, it's fine but it's not anything top tier.</Text>

Would give it six stars if I could good people that work there that work hard and do their job right. The managers are great and the way they run the store could use some work but overall is fantastic 10 out of 10 - IGN would come back. Plus they have fantastic MarNar
Sauce.< /review>

I guess when you order online and the wait is 20 minutes, they want you to wait at home for 20 minutes and come into the store and wait another 25. 45 minutes to assemble a pizza!!!< /Review>

How long does it take to put toppings on a pizza and hand it to someone.  Its not even baked.  Very slow and the pizza isn't that great. The kids that work there are kind of rude too.<//text>

Take and bake pizza. Usually about a 20 minute wait from order to pick up. Call you order in before arriving.< /review>

<Text>I really appreciated the service I received at this dealership.  Steve was very helpful and informative. They had to install a whole new exhaust for my TDI, so they kept it for a few days. When Steve called me he did inform me that he was expecting my service light to come back on he just wasn't sure when it would. But he reassured me that once it did they would fix it. Once I showed up, ironically it came on when they were trying to drive it to the front. So they kept it for a couple days. Everything was covered under warranty and all the timing was actually pretty convenient to my schedule. I was so happy to have my car back, it has been a couple months since my visit my car has been running perfect. Satisfied customer:)</Text>< gmap_id>

Willy was great to deal with when my retro 92 Corrado was giving me trouble and again with my Audi. Thanks Willy! They are like family, hmm maybe cause they are owned and operated by a great local Chico family. Hi Amy..  Waylon was great. He stayed late into the night and we found the perfect car.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>I was very disappointed/surprised with the sales manager here. This dealership lost out on a 30K deal from us because of his attitude, I intentionally hide how much cash I have at my disposal until I get to know the dealer better and see how they treat me if they think that I'm poor (the only time you'll see a person's true colors is if they think you're not financially stable), and he completely failed the test. Ended up buying from a different dealership and told them they can thank the sales manager here for the purchase.

I'll try to give the benefit of the doubt that this guy was just having a bad day, hopefully this review can serve as a learning experience and he can learn to be better to people.

I'm exhausted and have to get back to it soon but let me leave you with this valuable rule in sales my friend: treat every customer that walks through your door as if they have up to a 50K budget to spend on a car because they just might<//review><username>Fake Nate</username><date>1612156940922</date>< rating>

<review>The best dealership in Chico great service and really feels like a family. They will treat you right and fix your car up right. They have some of the best mechanics in the industry and some really great service staff. Steve Duncan is the man for all of your Vw and mazda service needs! The management will take care of anything you need, And the sales team picks up some of the best used cars on the market!!!< /review>< pics>

We had an excellent experience buying our Toyota Rav-4 at Chico Volkswagen today. I highly recommend asking for Nick when you stop in for a visit. He was flexible, accommodating, and very understanding of our asks. I have serviced my car here for years and will continue to do so thanks to my positive experience today.<//Text>

<text>Let me start by saying that I have always loved Chico Volkswagen. Between my wife and I we have purchased 4 cars from this dealership. After my wife and I were involved in an accident we went into Chico Volkswagen to look into replacing our 2018 Tiguan that was a total loss. When we purchased the vehicle we were told that Gap insurance would give us 1000 towards the purchase of a new vehicle. Upon bringing this up to the sales manager Dustin Drenon he treated us as if we were liars. From this point he became incredibly rude and condescending each time we interacted with him. My wife and I decided that it would be better to purchase a car elsewhere. We reached out to our GAP insurance and we were informed that they do indeed give us 1000 towards the purchase of a new car, but we would only be able to purchase the car from Chico Volkswagen in order to take advantage of this. We decided that even with the 1000 GAP would give us, it was not worth bringing our business back to Chico Volkswagen. We purchased a 2020 Tiguan R Line from Dublin Volkswagen and had an excellent experience.

Chico Volkswagen’s service department is second to none, but I would not recommend purchasing a car from this dealership if Dustin Drenon is involved. After being involved in a major car accident he was incredibly insensitive, condescending and rude.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I don't give many 5's these guys as far as a dealers go were straight up, helpful, and seemed honest. Now I didn't deal with the sales side but parts and service seemed nice, they took care of my needs and got me on the road fast.

Thank you!!<//text>

Went online and scheduled an appointment to have some work done the next day while I waited. They didn't try to over sell me and the car was ready before they promised. They threw in a car wash and had some parts that I wanted on hand. The work was solid and I paid about what I expected. The staff was friendly and the customer lounge was clean and comfortable. Eventhough they are 50 miles away from my home. I'll be back when I need a service or decide to upgrade from my current VW.<//review>

<Text>Unfortunately, my car battery died while I was waiting in the vet parking lot with my accessories on. I jumped the battery and took my car straight over to Chico VW. I did not have an appointment but I was assured my car could be attended to before the end of the day. By 11:30 I received a text message indicating my car was finished and I was back on the road before noon! Thank you Chico VW for fitting me in same-day, and thank you to your awesome shuttle service that dropped me off at home while I waited and picked me up to retrieve my car.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>The sales staff was real nice however the car was used and dusty they said cause they just got it in but there was pics of it clean online, the dust hid that the car was covered in sap they said would not come off after I asked them to clean it even though it came off the windows. I guess buyer beware, they never disclosed to us there was sap damage.< /text>< Pics>

What they didn't say 😁 needs brake rotors replaced ,needs all wheel alignment,crack right in drivers line of view,hidden with sale sign,manager added 2500$ to the finance , oil was everywhere, from sloppy service work,,truth hurts, maybe you should realize, you can't hide improper repairs,just do the job correctly, don't add on hidden fees, and people would keep coming back,,p.s.my car was 190 point inspected ,28,000 miles< /Review>< gmapID>

<text>We had a great experience yesterday when we bought a new 2019 VW Arteon. Nick, our salesman, was awesome! He was very knowledgeable about the car, and if you didn't know something he went to find the answer. He was very friendly and fun to work with. His supervisor, Dustin, was just as good! He was very knowledgeable and completed the buying process with us. I commented to Dustin that this was the easiest car buying experience we'd ever had. I definitely recommend Chico VW. Looking forward to getting my car regularly serviced and pampered with them.< /text><user_name>Colleen Herrel</user_name><user_id>105363190196281315718</user_id>< Response>

We called and set an appointment with Hardy, who was so awesome attentive and overall very knowledgeable about the cars. Brandon the General Manager blew us out of the water with his customer service skills, and his ability to make you feel so comfortable with every single financing option available and which one works best for us. Lastly Jeffery in financing was the icing on the cake, he helped us cross the finish line, and after hours of searching for the right car and filling out applications, his face was a refreshing one, knowing he would just walk us through a few signatures before we got to leave with our dream car! Thank you so much to everyone at this dealership, now our family is able to travel together, happy as can be :)</Text>< Response>

Ive bought several cars from this dealership and they’ve always been willing to work with me and keep me as a customer.

Unfortunately though, with Dustin as the sales manager, we are no longer going to be customers of Chico Volkswagen.

Dustin was incredibly condescending and rude toward me after our Tiguan we bought from them last year was totaled by another driver.

He basically called me a liar several times when I said my GAP insurance would give me 1000 toward the down payment of a new car. He acted like it was a waste of his time to show us an Atlas.

I don’t know how this 20-something year old who has only been at this dealership since May landed himself a sales manager position when he has the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced from this dealership.<//text>

I recently just bought a car from Chico Mazda / VW, my experience was delightful. The sales team was on it, Marcus was very attentive! All of my questions were answered on the spot, everyone was very informative and helpful. Once I had chosen my vehicle, the detail team did an outstanding job making sure it was sparkling! Overall a great experience, thanks Chico VW!</Text>

Even though I booked an appointment I still ended up waiting about four hours before they got to my car and then finally tell me they can't update it but they gave me a reference and they did not charge me so besides my time being wasted I did go test drive a couple cars and they did know I had no intention in buying them so I had fun I just wish having an appointment that mean I still had to wait that long otherwise everyone was cool and reasonable there that was extremely helpful and it wasn't like anyone was trying to pitch me a car especially when my Mazda has low mileage on it and in mint condition< /Review>

<review>I would never buy another volkswagen unless it came with a lifetime bumper to bumper warranty with no deductible. They might drive nice and have a lot of nice engineering features, but their mechanical failures in the ones we have owned with design issues they did not stand behind were the last straw and costly ones.  Traded one in for basically salvage value for a reliable replacement.< /review>< Pics>

< review>
This is my second experience with Chico Volkswagen/Mazda. I am not usually one to write negative reviews or complain publicly as I understand everyone has off days, however, these photos are from the second visit I've made to this service shop for recalls on my Mazda. The first visit involved opening up my dash to complete recall work and upon completion I found a piece of spare plastic in my passenger seat that turns out to be for the dash that technician forgot to install, easy fix, no big deal as the repair work was done. Upon this second visit to repair a separate recall issue I returned to the dealership to collect my car only to be notified that a small puncture had been made it my front bumper. I received no phone call to inform me of the accident, and while discussing the mishap I also received no apology from the man managing the situation. They are setting my car up for repair. I am hopeful that they will repair it properly with no further issues and in the future treat their customers with a bit more respect, sincerity, and honesty. I will gladly edit this review once work has been completed.

Update:
Body work was completed as discussed</review>

Chico Volkswagen is not only a great dealer who sells fabulous cars which Keith did last year when he sold me a fantastic Diesel Jetta TDI and I still love it like it like the first minute. But they have also a wonderful service department were you get great maintenance. Their outstanding service and friendliness is worth coming there, even with the smallest questions.

< Review>
The service department isn’t even worth one star. I went back to VW for servicing my Jetta, as the first time I had my car serviced there was fantastic! Why wouldn’t I go back? My car had to be towed to the center due to the engine issues(it wasn’t safe driving it from Corning in the condition it was in). The battery was fine with no issues at all. Two weeks later and I had to call them to find out not only was my car done, but they killed my battery & made me pay for it. Steve told me in response “well, it would have died in a week anyways.” The overall experience was subpar and unprofessional, with a lack of accountability. I won’t go back unless this is amended, and I won’t suggest the service department to anyone I know.</Review>

Awesome experience buying a used car! Salesman Koby was very friendly, helpful and knew his business well. We came in knowing what we wanted and there was no effort to get us into something fancier and more expensive. I really appreciate that! We got exactly what we wanted at the right price and it was completely stress free. I'll go back to them for my next vehicle. Thanks!<//Review>

<review>Having returned to Chico after 17 years away, and having been so happy with my Mazda being serviced at Concord Mazda, I was of course a little concerned about bringing it to a new service center, but I couldn't be happier with the service I received at Chico Mazda!
Steve Duncan was my service manager, and he was so kind, so courteous and so informative -  and he leads a great team of people!
The gentleman that washed my car was such a sweetheart - thank you for that! Have your Mazda or your Volkswagen serviced here with full confidence.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

The dealership has outstanding salesmen and a large selection of vehicles to choose from.  My overall experience was nothing but positive.
The wait time for car service was very good and the service tech was very personable.<//Text>

Nick was super helpful and patient w/me, the mechanic got things done quickly so I could continue on my journey. I am not local but for the repair required, the shop was very friendly and diagnosed the issue quickly. I got a ride from the rental car place back to the shop. All in all excellent service. Highly recommend, although I am not familiar with costs/value of extensive repairs.</Review>< Date>

I had a really wonderful salesman, Steve, help me find a beautiful new Jetta:-) He helped set my personal info on my console and answered all my questions regarding the operation of my new vehicle so that when I drove away I felt at home in my new car:-) It is a lovely dealership with many cars to chose from. A few months later I returned to have some spike spiders installed and was treated warmly and courteously by all staff:-) Great place to buy a car:-)<//review>

<review>Purchased a 2012 Jetta at a great price. Overall good experience compared to other dealers we looked at. Salesman was excellent (Keith). Finance gave us a final quote for monthly payment and tried to increase it significantly at the last minute during contract signing. Manager came in from another office and gave us the run-around about it. We also had to complete our down payment over the phone after we left, because they forgot to ask for it. Furthermore, we had an issue with the down payment that could have been handled if we were in the finance office and not on the phone. They would not allow us to switch the method of down payment the next morning after contract was signed costing me in the long run. Their finance department should have been willing to work with us on this, since they were at fault in the first place. Not happy about that. Good salesman and great prices, but I HIGHLY recommend you secure your financing elsewhere before buying a car from them.<//review>< Pictures>

I would give Chico VW 6 stars if I could! The service team is incredible and always strives to have your back with integrity. It's easy to be taken advantage of when taking your vehicle in for service, but this team is transparent and HONEST! Barry, one of the Sales Managers, is extremely knowledgeable and works hard to find you the right deal to meet your unique needs. Brandon, the General Manager, is friendly and is a total car guy who loves what he does and it shows. It's a pleasant experience when dealing with someone who is genuinely passionate about what they do and will work hard to see you leave the lot with a smile on your face! Mark and Amy are kind, local owners who love the community they serve! It's worth every cent to support this local dealership and save the gas because you don't need to go anywhere else whether you're getting service or buying your next vehicle!  Overall, I will always recommend Chico VW!<//Text>

Purchased a used car from Keith at Chico VW. Highly recommend. Very accommodating throughout the process. Different from the other car experiences that I've had. You definitely feel the nice small town vibes! Since I was going from far away, I appreciated that he worked with me over the phone to get a deal finalized.< /review>

Didn't have no problem with the sales department but the parts department sold me a adapter for towing not telling me I needed a control box and needed to get it programed for $1000 then when I tried to return the adapter Stephen said he would not take it back because it was plugged in, even though they are the ones that plugged it in, plus it was never used.< /text>

Dont spend your money here.

Went in on my lunch break for a simple oil change and the Service manager gave me an estimate of $109.84 (Oil change/ tire rotation). I asked him about any VIP promos or discounts because the car was purchased from Chico VW and he said they didn't apply to me. He even sold me on the extra $20 tire rotation that even Walmart does for free.
When I got off of work the shuttle driver from the VW dealership was 25 minutes late. I saw a coupon online while I was at work, for an oil change/tire rotation for $69.99 at Chico VW. I asked if he would honor this coupon at the checkout and he said he wouldn't because the coupon must be present at the "time of write up". I then asked him why he didn't mention the coupon earlier when I was asking about promotions. He knew all about the underlining details and fineprint of the promotions but neglected to tell me there was a coupon in the first place. The $109 then turned into $120 when it was time to pick up the car.
The manager obviously knew all about the coupon and lied right to my face about it. I will never do business at such a shady establishment and you shouldn't either.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<UserId.>117138257039325633165</UserId.><name>Josh W< /name><Time>1535666927730</Time><rating>5< /rating><review>I had a great experience purchasing a used Toyota from this dealership. I chose this dealership because they had the car I wanted. I was already preapproved with a good interest rate before showing up to check out the car, and I had also reviewed the carfax. The salesman I worked with was Craig. He was very easygoing and pleasant to do business with. He knew most of the details from the carfax off the top of his head, which is pretty impressive considering the number of used cars they have for sale. He did a good job explaining all of the car's features. The car itself was in great condition, whoever detailed it did a great job and the previous owner took good care of it. It's a solid car. No issues since driving it off the lot 500 miles ago.

The finance manager (not going to try and spell her name) was also very kind and easy to work with. I did not feel like I was being pressured or manipulated into paying extra for things I did not want. She offered to try and beat the interest rate I came in with, but ultimately she could not. The whole process was pretty quick and easy, and everything was explained thoroughly. Compared to other dealerships I have shopped at, this was a breath of fresh air. I highly recommend checking them out if you're on the market for a new or used car. I got the car I wanted at a great price and everybody I dealt with was nice and helpful.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Went into this location for a oil change. Afterwards we picked up the car and no mention was made to any major issues to the car.  While driving home we noticed a note in our paper work that it said power steering was empty but on the check off sheet (That shows  green,yellow,red sections to check off if a area has a issue) it was marked as green (with other fluids)

We get home and sure enough it is bone dry.  So we take our second car out O'Rileys and take care of it ourselves.  I don't know what to think here as honestly, if it was noticed they could have called and I would have just had them take care of it.  Since then the fluid level hasn't changed so as far as I can tell there is no leak.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<review>Update to my review! Nick, the service manager contacted me the next tuesday after this review.
Volkswagon has fixed the issue with my sons car. The gas gage now works, the fuel filler tube no longer over flows. Nick, the service manager took care of everything, met my son at the door and drove the car into the shop. When I arrived, (I was meeting my son at the dealership to take him to breakfast, then work), Nick met me in the parking lot. I asked for a note stating this issue would not affect the engine and Nick provided that. The car was done before my sons lunch, my son called them and they came and picked him up at his work.
All is well again and we received professional, quality service!
Thank you Nick for taking such wonderful care of my sons car!

-------------------
I purchased 3 VW'S here. I co-signed on one with my son.
He bought a 2015 Wolfsburg passat. Right after he bought it in 2015, the back window stopped working. Now keep in mind, we live in Oroville and this is Chico. He worked full time in Oroville too.
First and second time he took the car back, they said dust had gotten on a censor telling the car that the window had something blocking it from going up. He was charged 150.00 each time. The third time, someone finally listened to him and hmmmm the motor was bad. He paid 150.00 that time also.
Now after someone hitting him, a evap hose was damaged causing lights to go on.
After another 150.00, he found that out. He took the car in after I asked them if they dealt with insurance to get it fixed and they said they wouldn't deal with the insurance. But the manager got involved then and got it done.
Today's trip is to bring the car back because after paying 80.00 to Pep Boys who put it on their scope & looking at VW'S work, they found the job done wrong and emissions still leaking in the air. VW told me that they had to do their own 150.00 scan again to diagnose it. I said no, pull the wheel, pull off the plastic wheel well like pep boys did for free and check your work.
If there is anything else wrong with it, we will take it back to Pep Boys, we can't afford your work and we want it done right. I am done with them! I am trading my VW passat in for a Cadillac!< /review>< UserId.>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>Knowledgeable service dept. They are notoriously a bit slow, some of that has to do with parts being ordered, perhaps they're just busy. Also, if you own a German car, parts and repair are almost always going to be expensive. I've taken my 2006 GTI to them several times and ended up shaking my head as I handed over the credit card. Not their fault though. Overall the staff is great, they're honest and care about their customers. This didn't affect my rating, but they definitely need a new location! It's overcrowded and a little disjointed (with the two properties across the street from each other). Hopefully they can get a proper lot soon, they deserve the business!</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808327b5c0f14955:0xbaf6b345189fcf0f< /gmapID></record>

They are so incredibly slow!  I have traveled all around the country as a travel nurse and been to many VW service centers and this is the worst so far.  They don't offer loaner cars, they took over an hour and a half for an oil change, have no refreshments and refused to take the $25 off coupon that was mailed to me by VW for my next service.  The decision to not participate in mailed VW coupons is ridiculous and just shows (along with everything else stated) that you are CHEAP and don't care about customer retention.  Go elsewhere!< /review>

<Text>I purchased a 2013 Volkwagen Jetta from this dealer recently, and I WAS very satisfied with my purchase. It was well priced and came with a great warranty. Or so I thought. The warranty has proven to leave me wanting. Recently, the clutch disk catastrophically failed while I was driving, leaving me stranded on the side of the road. The dealership was all too happy to tow my car down  to Chico (from Red Bluff.) This was likely because they knew it would be harder for me to retrieve after they told me just pulling out the transmission to look at it would cost me more than $900. They left it ambiguous as to whether I would be charged for this or if it would be covered by the warranty -- even if other parts that were definitely covered by the warranty were broken. Their final estimate for the repair was over $2000, but they carefully avoided telling me whether my warranty would cover any of that, even after directly questioning them. So now I have to drive down to Chico and tow my car all the way back here so I can fix it myself, which would probably cost around $500 maximum.</Text>< pictures>

<text>Pitiful ....  customer service is terrible and so is the car service. if you guys want to leave with a messed up car then by all means go ahead and let these guys mess up your car.  But I advise you to go somewhere else...your choice though  can’t even perform a task as simple as an oil change without destroying a car. What a disgrace...<//text>< Pictures>

<review>Too expensive!

I took my Jetta TDI for an oil change and apparently it was due for a timing belt.  They quoted me $1200!
I wish I would have known about costs such as these before I bought this car!

Luckily I found another shop in town with a mechanic that used to work at a Volkswagen dealer and he
changed the timing belt for half as much.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808327b5c0f14955:0xbaf6b345189fcf0f<//gmap_id></record>

<resp>None< /resp><Name>Dave Von Redlich<//Name><review>I was turned on to Volkswagen by a friend who owns Porsches. He said if you can't afford a Porsche get a VW since they're built at same factory. I'm glad he suggested it because they are very well built. Leased my first one at Redding VW, they closed so took lease in after it was up to Chico VW and traded for new one. The deal was very simple.  Staff are very friendly and eager to let you test drive cars on the lot. Some of the lease paperwork wasn't sent to DMV which was a hassle  and expect that not to happen again on the next trade in. Building is very nice, and modern and now they have a newer more modern building for their Mazdas. Servicing your vehicle there takes a long time, even for an oil change, so plan on dropping it off and them calling you when it's ready.<//review><rate>4<//rate></record></dataset><record>

I purchased sparkplug wires from the dealership with a lifetime warranty. 3 years later 1 of the OEM wires went bad so I called them up trying to get a new wire and they told me they don't have any history of me purchasing the part and said if I didn't have a receipt that there was nothing I could do. So I called for the warranty dealer which is also at the Chico dealership. They told me that she wouldn't be back to work for 5 days and she's the only person that can help me. I call BS. They can get on their computer and look up my name and tell me in about 2 minuets weather or not I purchased them, but it's someone elses job. I need my vehicle for work so 5 days ain't gonna cut it. It takes about 5 min to replace this wire and they want me to wait 5 days!? Never buying over priced parts from them again especially when they try to give me the run around for some sparkplug wires. Give me a break!<//Text>

It was a favorite of mine before they closed for renovations. It's even better now food is great and authentic service and ambiance is awesome. Looking forward to returning a few more times in the summer.<//review>

Great food, but the environment is not good. The sofa is dirty. The lunch special is a great deal.Overall, it is a nice lunch.<//text>

<text>Had the lulue kabob sandwich today and man that thing was delicious.! Really good. We ordered about 20 sandwiches for a gathering we were having and every enjoyed the food..best part is the price such good quality food for a low price..I think the sand which bread could be a little better and the beef kabob could use more sauce.</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

High end Greek food. Terrific baba ghanooj and greek salads. Kids enjoyed their rice, fried and assorted fruit. Young hip crowd around enjoying the hookahs. My wife was in love with the black & white decor.< /text>

The food was absolutely delicious and had a nice presentation. We got the Shrimp Kabob and the Filet Mignon Kabob. My boyfriend also ordered a Watermelon Hookah and told me it it was full of flavor. Prices were a little high, and an 18% tip was automatically charged to all orders no matter the size of the group. Our server didn’t check on us until after we finished our food and were waiting on the check. We weren’t in a rush and obviously enjoyed our food so it wasn’t that big of a deal, but it would’ve been nice, especially with the tip situation (which is probably the reason checking on us wasn’t a priority since they get a high tip regardless - that’s why I don’t like the automatic tip scenario with a small table).< /Text>

This review is long overdue. My boyfriend and I came here back in June when we visited L.A. and were completely blown away by this place.
This is a hidden gem! The area is like an enchanted terrace surrounded by tall hedges with lights strung across them and you'll quickly forget that this restaurant is located in the middle of the city. The food was AMAZING! The only reason I would ever consider moving down there is for food like this. We ordered a bunch of things from the menu to try a bit of everything and we were not disappointed in any way, everything was beyond expectational! The prices are awesome for quality food like this too, we couldn't believe how low our tab was at the end of the night.
Our server was nice and wasn't hovering over us all night which was nice. The owner/manager came to introduce himself to us offering us tea.  Everyone was exceptionally nice, the environment was stunning,  and the food was beyond mouth watering delicious! I'll definitely visit this place every time I'm in L.A.<//text>

The food is alright, this is an open roof, so make sure to take an extra jacket at night especially during winter time. However there are heaters all around you can still get cold. The vibe isn't as energetic as I thought, but maybe I went at a wrong time. I'd give them another try. The baklava is delicious and I tried the kabob.< /review>

<user>110508419682493045707<//user><text>The food restaurant is a little tricky to locate but we found it, there was street parking and a parking structure.

As you walk in you see how nice the restaurant is and the Interior. We requested to sit on the sofa because I have back problems but were refused due to us being only 2 people, I guess you need to have a party of 4 or more.

Anyway, the menu was nice and not too complicated.   I think it would be better if they had some pictures of some of the dishes. The prices were reasonable,  a little high but worth.

The atmosphere was nice and the people werent too loud or crazy.

I think if the service was just a tiny but friendlier or showed a smile I would give it a 5 out of 5 . But check it out it's a nice place to hang out with a friend or go on a date .<//text>< gmapID>

Spent 3.5 hours for dinner. The waiter seemed nice at first but quickly spiraled from there. Over the course of our visit, the menu's were never picked up. The appetizer plates were never picked up. Drinks were not brought after ordering, food did make its way to us sparingly but many people were missing their meals. Waiter didn't seem to care much but did ask if we as a table were missing things. Shouldn't they know that? No problem, we reminded them of the missing orders but the clock ticked by without much resolution. Sandwiches were sub par and seemingly took the longest to get. Which made me wonder if they order them out rather than make them in house. The waiter didn't apologize (which would have gone a long way) and the manager was pretty rude. Telling us that 'you should have made a reservation'. Wow I'm sorry, but we did and that is no excuse for this disastrous experience.
Honestly, the place has a nice vibe that was quickly ruined by sub-par service. I never leave reviews but I can honestly say many people in our group were pretty upset that it was a struggle to get our food & drinks. The waiter at one point just flat out argued with us over a side salad. (We ordered a side salad, it is listed as such on the menu and the waiter said they don't have that). Honestly, there isn't anything nice I can say other than you won't see any signage on Venutra blvd. Hopefully you'll drive right past and find a better place to spend your hard earned money.</review><user_name>Vaughn Vartanian< /user_name>< Rate>

Not going there anymore and will keep posting this reviews hell everywhere I can !

Me and my friends walk in to that place and the first what we get on the damn entree is that server treated us like we are an escort girls and was sending us to some dudes table were was like 10 guys !!! Like wtf !
We reserved table so finally they show us the table l!
Nobody came to us during 30 min... no water no menu no nothing !!!! It’s insane !!! They so slow
You need to ask menus twice or at least some water

We have been waiting for so long
Finally they brought some food, my friend didn’t like this salad and she asked the server to change it or remove it so the server just answer her” well you better eat or pay for it ! If you don’t like food here so don’t come “😳😳😳😳 we freeze for like few seconds cos we were in shock and don’t know how to react on this kind of rudeness!!!!!
We are assumed this server guy was under some drugs or kinda drunk !
This attitude is unacceptable!!!!
He was telling my friend that he will not change anything and she have to pay for that salad of course we immediately call for manager.
And we ask for another server anyway he came back to us again with apologies and that he will “take care of us” and “ will bring as apologizes some complimentary salad and etc”
Basically I didn’t even hold the menu and I never order what he brought
We thought it’s complimentary as he state on that !
Hookah also was terrible
20 min and it gone so they also told us it will be complimentary but by the end charged us for everything we not even order ! We were completely in shock ! Our night was ruined ! this stupid meneger argued with my friend for like 35 min
We was stating on that we don’t want to pay for what we have never ordered and bad hookah!
Manager been acting aggressive! So they forced us to pay !
Reporting for discrimination and reporting for legal rights to get my refund from this hole !!!
FOR ALL MY LIFE I NEVER HAD THIS HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!
I will keep saying everybody about this place and what happen !!!!< /Review>< pictures>

To begin with, highly Over priced! Food portions on the set menu are ridiculously small. You have to ask several times to get one more of the same plate.  Set menu plus 2 drinks and a hookah plus tax and tip is around $130 a person. For what??</Review>

<pics>None</pics><review>Searched for a place to eat on the way home from work, that was not going to close at 9pm. Such a great find! Open till midnight! They have a huge heated patio with plenty of comfortable chairs and couches. People smoke hukkah but it was not overwhelming. They have inside seating too.It was cozy and welcoming. The employees were very helpful and they do not rush you out. I came super hungry..Had the hummus with sausage. The Sausage gave great compliment to the nutty smooth flavor of the hummus. Next was the filet mignon & beef koobideh. The meat was so buttery, tender and yummy: came with vegetables, rice and pita. Had some room for a napoleon.wow!!!! So great! Would come back over and over.< /review><resp>None</resp><user_name>Ron< /user_name><gmapID>0x80c2bdfb70592321:0xd4f6c5a22201df75<//gmapID>< rate>

<Review>Food has no flavor, service was par at best, they were out of basic items like beer or vegetables.  It's best for hang out and hookah.  Eat somewhere else, food and drinks are overpriced.< /Review>< Pictures>

This is the second time this restaurant has screwed up my order and embarrassed me in front of my friends with such terrible service. I am not sure why they have gone downhill. Even the waiter barely spoke English and was impossible to communicate with</Review>

<Review>Ordered the spicy Eggplant in thoughts that it would be mild and because it was as close to vegan as possible. Although the flavor is good it is too spicy to actually enjoy. I wish they had a lower level of spicy so I could actually eat it. Might have to go back and try other items but this was a let down.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2c920f1e69a95:0xb8f07c79a98ace32</GmapID></record>

I've been living in hunting park for over 20 years and I have never heard of this place. Decided to give it a try with the wife and was not disappointed. The portions and prices are great and have a good menu.  My only complaint is the chopped fried pork. It literally is only fat. While I didnt enjoy one dish I will definitely be a returning customer!</text>

The food was ok. I felt for the pad see ew I got, the green stuff it had, I felt that tasted stronger than the actual seasoning. So I felt it was ok. Not all that, like how some ppl are saying.<//text>

DE-LIC-IOUS😋 Mind you I ordered the green curry with shrimp (mild) and the red curry with chicken (medium). Initially I thought the green curry had too much basil, but then my tongue realized it's the right amount. It tasted different..
BUT it's better than most green curries I've had in this town.
The red curry was just right with a healthy portion of chicken.
I subtracted one star because I didn't get enough shrimp. You never do 🙄, but for $25 worth of food, you still feel like you should...< /Text>

Go in here is always a great experience, love the food and they are not expensive at all for the portion sizes. Most of the time the waitress are very attentive, there is exception but overall good service.<//Text>

<Text>When I typed in "best restaurants in HP" this was number 1 for some reason. I will forever will be finding out why. I leave it to you to answer my fellow reader. The food is not horrible. Quick. Just dirty and poor table service stood out. It did get busy. People just like the hot soup and ice Thai tea. Parking can be tricky. I will not be back.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgnTaMZuVbkfh6q6pVoMaYon2T9nwDQa3yxFA3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNa16qc6MazRKPvWhuo3o-FGd9Lx6B_kQgXZXrR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

They are extremely busy,  I tried calling them several times but I just hear a busy signal.  When I got there I waited in line and  I placed my order for 2 items.  I got home and the order was wrong.  I tried calling them AGAIN but I still get a busy signal and they are about close 😡😡😡.  I spent $23 and got something I don't want.   I understand they are busy but they should keep there phone line open!!< /review>

<Text>Ordered the Thai Beef Salad, good portion size enough to feed two people, and the veggies looked/tasted fresh. So now let's talk about the beef, or I think it's beef. Super tough like leather, looked "old" maybe they served me horse meat, who knows. So, I would avoid this dish due to the quality of the meat.<//Text><Time>1596656452816< /Time><gmapID>0x80c2c920f1e69a95:0xb8f07c79a98ace32</gmapID>< Name>

The places is so dirty and extremely out of order. You have to pick up for other and clean your table is want to eat there. Sadly just like many businesses they are short in staff.< /Text>

Their Won Ton Chicken Soup is comfort food...at it's best!
Cucumber/Carrot salad is cool and settling. The coconut drinks...in the hull...(right off the tree) are totally re-freshing. Thai tea, fresh lemonade with chia seeds...all the yummiest treats from this part of the World...prepared perfectly...with a light touch.
This little culinary wonder is set in a fantasy umbrella land. The help is totally disorganized and you will wait...but it's all worth it. You just relax...enter the world of Thailand and flow. They are so kind and "happy"...no body cares!
Last time I was there, I bumped into another restaurateur (with his family) who shared my opinion...it's one of the best.
The price? Shockingly low! Three of us ate and drank for $21.00...and had pleanty left over.
P.S.
It was delicious re-heated!<//review><time>1512969425083</time>< name>

<Review>This restaurant is family oriented. It looked good... I search for Thai food since i was in the area. I didn't feel as welcomed because I was alone. The service was bad. I ordered the pad Thai. It was ok. Not the best. But alright.</Review>< rating>

I've only had the ultimate fried rice here. Every time I return I just can't not order it. Contains beef chicken squid shrimp vegetables. Probably forgetting something. What great flavor for a "light" lunch. Very affordable. Lovely family run small restaurant.</text>

The food is ok but expect to be left waiting before they ask to take any part of your order during mild to busy times.

The menus are in need of cleaning. You can feel the grime and see the dirt on them for people handling them.

This place is a pass, not worth eating here.< /review>

Staff is young attentive girls w little experience, so don't get bothered that you have to repeat your request.  Also, may I suggest order drinks and entrees at the same time.<//review>< pictures>

Their food is good, but tonight's customer service was horrible. I called to place a pick up order as always, during the 1st call I was placed on hold for more than eight minutes. 2nd call four minutes, by the 3rd call I was bothered for their lack of customer service. The employee had the audosity to tell me that I kept calling and calling and that she would get to me when she could. I told her that I had been on hold for a long time that I was trying to place an order, but that I would be taking my $ elsewhere, she simply disconnected the call. Did not bother on apologizing for the delay as if she was paying for my food. Clearly their customer service skills have deteriorated, what a shame!!!!</Text>

I've been coming to this place since 09. The food is delicious and always have to have my chicken w/cashew nuts.

I recommend spicy shrimp fried rice with combination wonton soup. 🔥

*Have to change review because of the past year the food has been awful. No improvement. I'm dissapointed and have stop coming to this place.</Review>

Food is okay.  Have had better tasting Thai food in other places,  what I disliked the most was the service.  It was hard to get the waiter’s attention, and it was not even busy.  Wouldn’t be my choice for Thai food in the area.< /text>

I was a bit surprised when I walked in because from the outside you would never think it's a busy as it was!

We got seated right away, very colorful inside. We ordered the yellow curry, pad see ew with chicken. Delicious!!!

I'm mad at myself for not going to Jade Siam sooner!

Needless to say I'll definitely be going back, just be aware that parking is very limited so you might have to pay for street parking. Otherwise, it's a great experience with friendly servers and friendly customers!< /Text><gmap_id>0x80c2c920f1e69a95:0xb8f07c79a98ace32<//gmap_id>< rate>

I don’t know why people are saying the food here is amazing, you just don’t know what’s good or what is Thai food. I didn’t know Thai food came with onion, lemon and carrots 🤦🏽‍♀️</text>< user_id>

Despite it being one of the few restaurants in Vernon, that's not the reason I come here. The food is some of the best you'll find if looking for authentic Thai and the diverse menu will ensure you find something you like. The portions are large enough to share (or split into two meals) and can be made as spicy as you can handle. I highly recommend the spicy garlic and all the curry dishes.</review>

Very inexpensive, authentically delicious. I've been a patron for over 12 Yrs, they've outgrown the facility. It's a hidden gem in Huntington Park.<//Text>< Name>

<review>The food here is absolutely delicious. Their food is always freshly cooked. However space is limited so it can get pretty crowded. Not much of an issue if you call ahead and order for pickup though. Parking is also somewhat limited on busy days, as it is located in a small shopping area with more than one business. Absolute favorite dish is the green chicken curry, extra spicy. 5 stars cause of their service and food. They can't control parking lol.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<text>Highly disappointed based on the reviews. For Thai food the food lacked flavor. I tried the chicken satay, tom yum kai with chicken along with the yellow and panang curries, spicy garlic and pad see ew all of which I only had a couple bites and threw away. I only took more than one bite to confirm that the food was not worth eating. Would never go back. If you think this is good Thai food, I promise there is better out there. Keep looking as I have had it!</text>< pics>

The place is ok, the orange chicken was too crispy, the beef was not tender, and the chicken was dry. Won't be coming back no time soon.  The waitresses are nice and that's why the got 3 stars.<//Review>

<review>Best place to grap a bite for Thai Food plates.Only downside is that it gets packed in rush hours.So know what you want ahead of time so your food gets to you quicker.Call 10 min before you arrive if theres a party reservation for dine in.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

My only thing is that the waiters in the beginning at fast and attentive, but once you have your food, they forget about you. If you need refills, you have to wave for a long time and say , excuse me , until someone sees you to give you a refil. Then look for someone to give you the bill. If you don't ask for stuff and just wait, you'll stay there forever. But I'm used to it now... I get up and ask.</review>< pictures>

I honestly love the food here. I generally believe everyone has their own opinion  but i believe the food speaks for itself i always order take out the pad see ew is amazing i tell them to make it spicy for me and they satisfy my craving i love that about this place its extremely mouth watering  cant get enough of this place also tried the pad thai extremely recommend anything they make if you want it a certain way they will do it the way you would like they will work with you and the way you want it done i recommend the pad see ew extra spicy if you have a hang over works for me might work for you.</review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>Service was poor, I can understand that it is busy, But to feel entirely rushed and uncomfortable is unacceptable. Regardless of the area the restaurant is in should not be a reason to give such poor service. Food was okay the soup was good barely any seafood, rice was cooked well. it seems like a good place but the owner was rude in answering any questions.<//text>< Response>

The staff is very friendly,  the food is great, and the owner is constantly checking on his customers assuring they are satisfied.   I have recommended this place to many friends and family members and they all agree this is the best thai food.  :)< /Review>

Would give a 0 if possible, but I can't. Food was flavorless, chicken was dry, service was good, but the rest was awful. Wouldn't recommend to my dog (His names Jeff)</review>

<text>Very bad service. I "Specifically" told our waitress i wanted a "fish and shrimp soup" she brought me no fish. When i told her they made a mistake and "forgot the damn fish" they wanted to charge an additional 3 dollars. For "their" mistake im being asked to pay more?

Found this here on maps... Place doesn't look like much from the outside... And I was a little worried about the B rating... I'm convinced the B must stand for Best damn Thai food in LA!< /text>

My family and I have been coming here for a few years now it's one of your favorite spots! I'm giving them 3 starts because although it's great food the service isn't great. I wish the waiters were more attentive they don't visit your table at all and ask if you need anything else, you'll be waiting for a refill, the check, or some to go boxes for a while. A few visits ago one of the girls was extremely rude her face said it all she didn't want to serve at all I get it I work in food too but come on fake it till you make it.< /text>

It use to be the best Thai spots in Huntington Park. I don't know what happened but after today's experience. I'm not sure if I'd say it's the best anymore. The Thai spicy seafood soup was more like salt water soup. The seafood flavor was missing, which was a great disappointment after almost paying 15 dollars for salt water. The "thai tea" was more like sugar water with a hint of thai tea flavor. The service was terrible. Not once did the waitress check up on us. I had to get up to pay for my check, since no one took the effort to bring me anything. Not a box or a check. Talk about just bad service. The place was probably busy with 4 to 5 tables at most. Honestly I've seen this place packed and never did it give us this type of bad service.  Mmm ... Rain check on this one .<//Review>

<Review>The food here is delicious but the last two recent times I came here customer service has been terrible. One waiter was not able to answer any of my questions regarding the food. The most recent, I wasted a whole hour in the restaurant without getting attended and they still took forever to bring one plate which we never got because we left.
Not coming back again anytime soon.<//Review><date>1494188599070</date><rate>1</rate>< Pics>

I asked for my soup without onion and mushrooms so they wrote a note not to add any and asked to call back to verify the order came through and when I called they said the order was made that they looked at the wrong tablet and they couldn't do anything about it, I had to call postmates and of course I couldn't cancel the order with postmates because then they were going to charge the full amount. So this is why I'm writing this bad review, I feel that was definitely some very bad service.< /text>< Resp>

This place is good but isnt the best Thai food in town. Lol my mama's cooking its the best thai/cmabodian food in town.  But definately hits the spot when i want some comfort asian food and dont wanna drive far.< /review>

(Translated by Google) The noodles tasted water down the rice was acceptable the soup has tomatoe which I’ve never seen it before in a Thai restaurant the shrimp had no flavor I feel like if they could’ve done better job with the food

The noodles tasted the rice water, it was ok, the soup has tomato, which I had never seen before in a Thai restaurant, the shrimp had no flavor, I think if they could have done a better job with the food

Los fideos saboreaban el agua del arroz, era aceptable, la sopa tiene tomate, que nunca había visto antes en un restaurante tailandés, los camarones no tenían sabor, creo que si hubieran podido hacer un mejor trabajo con la comida< /Text>
