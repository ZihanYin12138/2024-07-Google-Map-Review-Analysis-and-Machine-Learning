<Gmap_id>0x809022a959ccde63:0x2b6e890506520519<//Gmap_id><review>My family and I found Arch Dental well over 6 years ago and although we moved to the Bay Area in 2015 I was determined to keep Dr. Kaur as my dentist. She is the best and makes you feel comfortable during every visit. She takes pride in her work, taking time to do a thorough job and gave me the confidence to finally get braces. The Office Manager, Angelina, is always inviting and excellent with following up, The last Office Manager, Sarah, was really good too and the dental assistant who greets me with her welcoming conversation as well. Prior to finding this place I had a horrible experience with poor customer service at a different dental office in Tracy, so I’m very thankful to find Arch Dental. They are flexible and easy to communicate with.</review>< Pictures>

So far so good. I went here after having an emergency with tooth breakage and wa so relieved to find out that the dentist may be able to save my natural tooth. I am so excited to see what the final decision will be.... Super sweet friendly staff. Loved the fact that they engaged in conversation and were extremely helpful.... Will update once procedure is completed!</review>

<Review>Dr. Kaur and her team are amazing. They saw me for an immediate dental emergency when my normal dentist could not. Everyone I interacted with was very comforting and Dr. Kaur explained what was going on with my teeth  very well. I had been with my “normal” dentist for about 15 years and switched to Dr. Kaur after my emergency. 10/10 would recommend</Review><date>1598413214210< /date><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rate>5<//rate><name>Marissa Matta< /name></record>

Dr. Kaur and her staff are the most professional, compassionate people in their field. Dr. Kaur’s attention to my comfort was far above my experiences with the so called “specialists”! She did a extraction of a wisdom tooth with little to no discomfort while the whole time asking and attending to any discomforts.  On a scale from 1 to 10 . . . a 1000!! Her staff made me feel like family.<//Text>

<review>The Arch Dental organization is top drawer.  They are all friendly and treated me like one of their family.  The doctor is picky in that she doesn't accept a "half-way" job.  Perfection is her goal.  They put together a treatment plan and include an estimate of the costs for having work done so the patient can make informed decisions.  And they are not pushy.  They only want to provide the services that your want.  I feel good that my dental health is in the hands of Arch Dental.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

Very kind and friendly Doctor,Dr. Kaur- she has the most gentle touch imaginable as a doctor whom has to do the most stressful procedure to you, as a patient. She cares and does not rush on procedures what so ever. Also she looks out for you as the patient not as her money maker as some other doctors do... no needless procedures, tells it like it is,(not at all like Mission Dental) Whom the Doctors are all about making that extra $$ off of you.
Thank you Dr. Kaur, to you and all of your staff there! You are truly Heaven sent!<//review>

First off I would like to start off by saying I am terrified of the dentist and I have tried multiple offices in Tracy and this one is BY FAR the BEST one. From the front office to the dental chair it was one of the most professional and caring expierences I have ever had and am so glad I finally found a place to stick with who's #1 priority is your level of comfort.</text>

< Review>
I had called a different dental office in the area before Arch Dental and that other office did not make any effort whatsoever to find me an appointment window that worked best for my schedule. They claimed they couldn't schedule me anytime soon and they don't schedule too far in advance. I cannot say this with certainty but I believe they were treating me like this due to my less desirable HMO plan.

Luckily, I decided to call Arch Dental and was offered an appointment window of my choosing. The entire staff was welcoming during my first visit especially the dental assistant, Yvonne, who took my X-rays. Dr. Kaur was also great in her work as I did not feel any extreme discomfort during the cleaning. Most importantly, I was glad that they did not make up an excuse to charge me anything for my free 6-month cleaning.

If everything goes well with my future visits, then Dr. Kaur will probably become my long-term dentist.< /Review>

Very nice people.
I'm a crotchety old geezer type.  Think of the old men up in the balcony on the Muppets, and you've got me pegged pretty good.

These young women are amazingly patient, and forgiving.  They put up with my nonsense, bad behavior, bad humour, for quite a while;  and
they keep inviting me back and encouraging me to take better care of my teeth.

What have I had done.  A couple of cleanings,  a couple of fillings, an old  crown redone.  The initial discussion on a series of implants.  Sent out to a specialist to have a bone graft done for the implants.

And all this time, Dr. Kaur and her wonderful team have been just amazingly patient, and wonderfully cheerful and encouraging.

I can honestly say that I would recommend them to all my family and friends;  without any reservations.

When I called I asked how much is a deep cleaning was quoted $499 the day of his appt. he does his exam and X-rays and the dr says its a waste doing regular cleaning that he needs deep cleaning he tells her ''  I still want cleaning done and I will do deep cleaning another day.'' Nonetheless he gets no cleaning and its $699 for deep cleaning now. To tell someone I don't want to do the cleaning because it's a waste is a joke. Too bad because had you not have done that he would have done all the work he needs there. The dentist is all about money not about taking care of her patients needs.<//review>< user_id>

ARCO, stop in to purchase a twelve  pack. Used my bank debit card for payment. I was shocked that the payment amount was charged an additional $0.35 to complete the transaction. This was including the profit margin that ARCO Inc. already makes just by selling the products.

Too convenient.  Also, slow workers! I stop here average 2 times a day. As many registers and employees the wait is ridiculous.< /text>

<Text>Excellent service. Employees are very lazy don’t want to clean the restroom . Very busy bc of workers in the morning time and a excellent location. The food place next to it is very expensive. They need better deals$$$ . But it’s definitely safe. Now the bathroom are SUPER DIRTY . The staff refused to clean them. So please judge a place it bathroom bc if it’s dirty they are dirty workers too.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>AMPM has decent coffee they also have an app that you can win stuff but because I ride a Harley Davidson I will never put Arco gas in my bikeit's the worst thing you can ever do to your bike or your car I don't even put that gas in my car if I'm in a spot where I'm almost out of gas and I need gas to get to the next gas station I'll put a couple bucks just to get me to where I use gas and that's Chevron</text>< pictures>

Price of gas is great, their car wash is awesome, but there will be a bit of a wait. They are always packed full, but seem understaffed.</text>

<text>This arco just stole $10 from me. Put $10 less on the pump than I gave them.

Refused to check the money or Cameras at that time. I don’t live near here, obviously won’t get my money back.< /text><time>1541282928858</time>< UserId.>

(Translated by Google) Bad experience in the corner station of foothill blvd and mount vernon in san bernardino, the very rough cashiers and cashiers, all the clients look at us as if we enter with intentions to steal not say the armed guard ... poorly trained cashiers They don't even greet customers. It is a very dirty place due to the high number of homeless people and the owners do not worry about pressure washing outside and in the area of ​​the bubbles.

(Original)
Mala experiencia en la estacion en la esquina de foothill blvd y mount vernon en san bernardino, las cajeras y cajeros muy rudos, a todos los clientes nos miran como si entraramos con intenciones de robar no se diga del guardia armado...cajeros mal entrenados ni siquiera saludan a los clientes. Es un lugar muy sucio debido a la alta cantidad de indigentes y los dueños no se preocupan en hacer pressure washing afuera y en el area de las pompas.< /text>

I came from San Francisco by a phone Saturday at 12:30 pm and it was closed on the website, it says the hours are from 11am to 5pm, call your number and answer the machine, they are very responsible
they are not serious...<//Review>

Great service if they would change their grading scale. Excellent Is scuffed screen with scratches or ever blurry camera lens.  Like new is like new, Excellent + is sightly better than Excellent and Excellent ++ or +++ is minimal scratches and such.<//Review>

Never again. I bought from them , and every time phones arrives not in the promised condition... don't forget that you have to pay for the shipment back.... when you call them out on the quality, they disable your account...Don't waste  your time, money or store reputation.< /text>

Have had bunch of bad experiences here. They resell salvaged phones that have previously have had some problem and purchase back stolen items and when you want to return it they will mark it down in your account as your fault. It’s unfortunate we have people like them in our community doing bad business.

Just a warning. They will cancel your account if you check them for their own mistakes. Unethical business and wouldn’t recommend anyone to these people</review>

Don't recommend this place, selling bad quality phones and some even get reported stolen after few months with no return or exchange policy after you buy over 30 days. If you tell them about it, they will rudely dismiss you and ban your account. Bad business practice here.< /Text>

Scored a few good deals here. Service could be better but the deals are worth it.

Update: Was here here again 8/2019 for another phone. Condition was NOT as described on their site. I pointed out the flaws and they said if I didn't like give it back, which is what I did. Complete waste of time!</Review>

Was still charged a shipping and handling fee when chosing the pick up option. The fee got added at end of finalizing the transaction. I was told this was a labor fee as they added the letter L to S&H.  But it is still posted as shipping and handling in my transaction with paypal. Overall, time and gas included, it costs more to go pick the item up than to just have it shipped.<//review>

great place to get a used phone.  I was following a phone online and every day one's not sold the price goes down.  I waited until the last moment and bought it.  I picked it up at the store and they went over any of the special notes posted on the site.  This particular phone had a note about screen discoloration on the left edge.  I bought it anyway and you can barely see any problem.  The phone is in great shape.<//Review>

<review>Them people that work at this company can't take criticism when they messed up your order.  They will just deactivated your account to avoid dealing with you in the future.

A buddy of mine had referred me to this place in the past so I decided stop by since they carry the type of food I buy for my pets. I was blown away Immediately by their pricing so much that instead of just buying 1 bag Of dog food to get me by while my ordered shipped I purchased 2 50lb bags and cancelled my online order. Huston Feed store will be my new place to shop for my dog food from now on. Very friendly and professional staff! I will definitely recommend this place to everyone!!!!< /Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Went to get chicken feed and the gentleman that helped me was very nice. He mixed up a bunch of stuff in her feed and she was in heaven eating all the worms. No one has ever mixed those in there for her before.</text>

Just such a wounderful experiance.  Jessee and Carlos are just so helpfull but the youngsters loading the feed really need to learn about there products because they are no help. playing on there phone is more important than doing there job. this doesnt take away from the wounderful experiance though. If you need supplies for birds or dogs there isn't and store around that compares to it. highly recomend shopping here just dont feed the children.</Text>

I sent my friends to this place with my warmest recommendations. I visit this place often. This recommendation is always successful. The meals are appetizing and the team is attentive and cooperative. Every time  we eat in this place we pass a lovely time.  I recommend this place with pleasure.< /review>

The food is amazing. But I can't get over the simple fact that they don't accept credit cards...but are willing to accept EBT cards...they close themselves off to potential future customers right there.. It's also not located in the safest of places..deducted 2 star for all that.

Update: 08/08/18- They are now accepting credit cards! Finally! Still located in some suspicious neighborhood but still worth every penny.</review>

Food is fresh.. Hot..an Delicious.. They're very quick with all their orders.. And lets not forget to mention they're EBT welcomed.. So If u don't have cash and your hungry.. Swipe that card.. And only one dollar charge. .. LOL Good place.. Good cooks.. Excellent customer service guaranteed ❤👼🙌<//Text>

I rated this place 5 stars last year, but I wouldn’t recommend it as of today. My order was wrong, and I was charged for food I didn’t order. I asked for a refund, and not only did they refuse - they wouldn’t replace the food either.< /Text>

<Review>The best fried seafood in town.  The whole meal including your drink will cost under 9$ for most of the menu. it's totally worth the taste . Meals are served with rice or fries and   sauté jalapeño and onions< /Review><date>1497073426408<//date>< pics>

Our family has been coming to Dr. Djafari for 3 years. From the moment you walk into the office the staff is very welcoming. They are profesional and do a great job. Dr. Djafari is very gentle when working on you. I have had dentists in the past be very rough and left me in pain afterwards. Not her!
I’m so glad to have found such a great dentist.<//Review>

They sell cleaning offers on Groupon and do just polishing when you buy it come to their office. NOT THE CLEANING. Just polishing. Pretty much just brush your teeth for you and ask for extra 18 dollars.</Review>

I am very satisfied with Dr Djafari excellent work.

I was a nervous patient at first. She went out of her way to try
and make me feel at ease.

Her team in the front office and the techs in the  examining room, are courteous and helpful.

I highly recommend Dr Djafari and her team.

< review>
Excellent service as always, especially in the world's current situations. All safety precautions were in place, limited patients in office, asking necessary questions, taking temperature, and requiring necessary face covering. The staff ensured that they were taking all sanitary precautions as well. Procedure was done with minimum contact.</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>The staff and doctor are wonderful.    Dr Djafari genuinely  cares for her patients. She and her staff are very friendly and take the time to explain everything before, during and after my visit.   I was worried I would have to lose my  tooth as I had a bad infection.   She assured me my tooth was still good and just needed cleaning and treatment.   Dr Djafari took the time to explain the importance of deep cleaning especially since I’m using Invisalign.   I’m so relieved and have great confidence in this office.   Thank you.< /Review>< Pics>

Dr. Djafari and her team are great. When I came into her office the staff was all very nice and welcoming, and Dr. Djafari is also that way. She's very thorough, and takes care of whatever I need right away. I love the attention she gives and not having to wait a long time is good too. Plus it's really easy to get there off the freeway. Thanks again!< /review>

< Review>
I have been with Dr. Djafari for at least 10 years.  She is the best dentist I have have had in all my 72 years.  She is a perfectionist, which one wants in a dentist, skillful, and diligent in her work.  Dr. Djafari is most personable, supportive, and honest.  She is warm and caring, unusual in a dentist.  The staff is friendly, supportive, and knowledgeable.  I feel she and her office staff are awesome.  Truly, if one MUST go to the dentist, which one does, THIS IS THE ONE TO CHOOSE!!!  I feel as if I am being welcomed by family when I have an appointment.< /Review>

Dr. Djafari is awesome! I have been w/her for a number of years & have never been disappointed. If she can't do it or fix it, she sends you to someone who can & they are also pretty good themselves.

I don't know what I would do if she wasn't a dentist here anymore. I highly recommend her if you're looking for a good & compassionate dentist.

I would certainly recommend Dr. Djafari to anyone in need of a professional, skilled and caring dentist. Her office is run extremely well and her approach to dentistry always makes my family and I feel comfortable and well cared for. I have never met a nicer, more honest dentist and am happy to say my family, friends and I have found our dentist for life!<//Text>

<text>NIGHTMARE dentist. Simple procedures are painful and she will do invasive and unnecessary work to overcharge you. She had me waiting for so long to get half my mouth deep cleaned and injected me with way too much anesthetic. My face was lopsided and swollen half the day! Worst part was she recommended all kinds of surgery and wanted turn a perfectly healthy tooth into a crown to make it "even" to my veneer. I've gone to multiple dentists to get second opinions and they all said I don't need any of the serious and expensive procedures she wanted to do! Now I drive 1.5 hours to go to a wonderful & very reputable dentist in LA. Link Dental in Culver city, that place was a miracle. They did beautiful work to whiten my veneer and quick, painless extractions for my wisdoms. No crowns or risky surgeries!<//text><user_name>Karina Solnce<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This is an excellent dentist that I’ve been going to for years. She’s a great find! She’s educated, professional, attentive and prompt. Her office is beautiful, and has art murals on the ceiling as you look up in your chair. More importantly, she has an integrative approach to one’s health that combines the best of western technology with the latest alternative treatments. In addition, she gives advice not in order to maximize her own profits, but to improve the patient’s overall dental health. Best of all, it doesn’t hurt! All the other dentists I’ve gone to in the past have had a rough manner, while she has a gentle touch. I highly recommend Dr. Djafari for cleaning and more involved procedures.</Review>< Pics>

The most Amazing Experience,,,
Dr. Djafari and her friendly and professional crew ,made my visit so pleasant and
comfortable.
she found the cavity that was not easy to detect, because my long time dentist missed it, not very long ago.
Her cosmetic and artistic work was quite  impressive.
thanks Dr. Djafari,
and big thanks to her nice team: Eli , Jeannette and Maria
See you as usual in 4 months...

I love the gentle and thorough care that I receive at Dr. Djafari's office.  It is easy to schedule an appointment and I love the staff there.  All of the prices and details of each procedure are explained to me before anything is done.  I can't recommend this dentist enough.<//Text>

I have to say I have had excellent care over the years with Dr. Djafari.  Much better then other dentists I have used in Riverside.  And especially on the prevention and deep cleaning and she spends lots of time with you.  The only draw back is they switched computer systems a couple years ago and it has some problems.< /Review>

<Review>My experiences with Dr. Djafari have been nothing but excellent. As opposed to the review below, I have NEVER had a problem with anything to do with this office. I rarely ever even have to wait to be seated and started on. Definitely have no regrets in switching over and will continue to go back.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>My experience with Dr. Djafari was great. Everything was perfect from her staff to the quality of her work. I used to hate going to the dentists but ever since switching to Dr. Djafari's office I have totally changed my perception about visiting the dentists. Not only was her work painless but my teeth look amazing after she was done and it was alot of fun talking to her and her fun assistants.  :)</Review>< Name>

<review>Great Dentist.

It had been a long time since my last dental appointment. I'm very pleased with the overall services. I needed quite some work and I was somehow embarrased by the staff was friendly and they explained to me everything about dental problems. When I left I was very surprised that they done such a great job in explaning to me the work I needed. I loved this place. I am certainly going back for my check ups.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Great pieces and even better service. I love the easygoing vibe here. Was offered drinks on the house "because I feel like it". Sushi was very beautiful and garnished like normally you'd only see on much more expensive sushi. After we asked about a specific bowl with flowers on another table, we were given the same roses as seen in the picture for free. Had a lot of fun.< /review>

<review>this place is great, like actually great. for 12am sushi it is top tier, I would give it six stars if I could. i went here on a late night with my boyfriend and I got the red dragon roll, my boyfriend got something else and it was also so good.  it's open super late and the waiters/waitresses are so chill and nice. always willing to help and always ready to get your order.  definitely recommend coming here.< /review></record>

My family and I were a party of 13, and the owner was super accommodating, letting us have a large table and giving us such an awesome service. The food was amazing here, from their Sashimi, sushi and hand rolls, to chicken karaage or beef teriyaki 🤤, nothing fails to impress me! The owner hung out with us, had shots with us and was super pleasant to be with, while proving us with fresh food within a moments. Low prices, for high quality sushi. A plus for real wasabi, they got horse radish if that's your thing as well. Will definitely go here again! Can't believe I've only just found out about this place!

Thanks for the service Andy, can't wait to come back for more 👍.<//Text>

The staff was really helpful, i was between a couple of rolls and I landed on a rainbow roll (nice and fresh) and a firecracker roll for some crunch. Nice distancing with the tables for dine in.< /Review>

Was glad that they were still opened at 10:30! Friendly atmosphere & there was a 20 min wait, but it seemed faster. Good was delicious & it was a little bit to cold. We ordered the California Roll, Avocado Roll & Shrimp Tempera Roll. Very good<//text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Well done with the soft shell crab and my shrimp tempura sushi roll. I came out impressed with the attention to the food.

Soft shell crab was very lightly breaded so the essence of the crunchy crab shell comes out. It takes practice and attention to serve something like that. The crabby insides were cooked so they aren’t in the raw side.

Shrimp tempura was just as lightly breaded. The rice was softly packed but far away from mushy.  A lot to appreciate.

Andy and team - keep it up!<//Text>< pics>

This place is a diamond in the ruff. Absolutely best sushi prices I've seen in the bay area but it's great quality food and service. This is my new go to sushi spot. The layout of the place is a little weird but who cares if your getting some good inexpensive food. Keep it up M J Sushi</Review>

Went here after being disgusted by Sushi Toro. Great quality fish for a very reasonable price! Amaebi and hotate were excellent.</Review>

Probably one of the best sushi places I've ever been to. The prices are cheap and the food is great, plus the drinks were on the house when O went. Highly recommend.</text>

Absolutely delicious, great service. Andy and the staff were great especially coming in an hour and half before close! Asked for a couple rolls to surprise me and not one was a disappointment. Highly recommend lion king roll. Miso soup is great as well. Will be coming back again< /Review>

Although the staff was nice and very friendly, felt that the food was a little bit overpriced for what they offered. The spicy tuna rolls and the avocado tuna rolls were good, felt that the Takoyaki could be better.

Overall an OK place to go 👍< /text>

It was one if our friends first time ever having sushi which we all know it's a like it or not situation and she LOVED it, especially the lion king roll ( if you don't like raw fish)  We enjoyed our time a lot! Andy was awesome! Definitely will be coming back for another birthday celebration next week!</Text><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808fc735dc8e5163:0xc347bf3f2a90e1b3< /GmapID><userid>100404643332048631027< /userid></record></dataset><record>

<review>The best service we've had in all of Fremont... Scratch that, the Bay Area as a whole. The environment is casual and the focus is entirely on the customer experience; ensuring that every person that walks through the door leaves happier than when they walked in... Nevermind the fact that the quality and value of the food is second to none. This is the only place we will go for sushi from now on.< /review><resp>None<//resp><UserId.>114033964872848783523</UserId.><Rating>5</Rating>< Date>

Great hospitality. We were offered beverages while we wait and it was on the house. We were also offered more free drinks and miso soup. The seafood seemed fresh. The menu was simple and easy to choose from. The wait was supposed to be 13 mins but it was more like 30/45 mins< /Text>

There’s a new sushi place in town!!! Our friends took us to a soft opening last week and I couldn’t wait to try out their takeout! Everything was delicious even after we took the food home (round trip slightly over 40 minutes due to heavy traffic). Will go back to try out everything else. My fav was the soft shell crab (super hard to find a place I like for this) and the deluxe chirashi which came with fresh wasabi. Service was excellent as well!!!< /text>

(Translated by Google) very delicious! The price is not enough~ If you have the opportunity to go with the group buying combination, it is very good value, the sashimi is big and fresh!

超好吃！價錢不夠～如果有機會跟到團購的組合很超值划算，生魚片又大又新鮮！< /review>

This place serves delicious Italian food!
Their complementary olive oil and balsamic vinegar with rosemary bread are so good!
The service is speedy and customer service is great. Needless to say, the food is delicious. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town.</review>

<review>The best pizza pub I have been to. Pasta is absolutely amazing,  and they change their menu,  so you are always surprised. The food serves so fast.  It's a great spot for a romantic date with matching wines and desserts.  The place has a calm ambiance,  which is good.   Highly recommended to everyone.</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Best and freshest Italian food in Ventura. Prices are good. The outdoor seating on Main St with our beautiful California weather is awesome. Portions are good (desserts are FOR SURE to share). I've been frequenting this place just as a cafe for an espresso and good vibes.< /review>

Went for a nice date with my husband tonight. Delicious food.  Well presented and  generous servings.  I called the owner in Dec on a day that the State reopened for patio seating....went a few times then the state closed down again.  We were back tonight and happily so. The owner (also a frontline worker as a nurse) was there to greet all guests.  Amazing!  A must add to favorites!<//Text>

It was still good, though. I would definitely go there again.< /review>< pics>

<Review>The food it's ok, the price also.... but omg it takes so long for them to take your order, and for you to actually eat  literally takes foreverrrrr , I understand the plates might be fresh, hopefully, but takes way too much time.  We went there twice, I dont think we will go again for this reason<//Review><user_name>Sorina Craus<//user_name></record>

First time out in a social setting in over a year, food was good, service was excellent, but it was kind of weird sitting in the middle of the street. Overall great experience.< /Review>

Wonderful experience. I enjoyed everything we got! Seafood pesto pasta was filled with a gracious amount of delicious fish and amazing flavors. :)))

The bread was also the perfect amount of crunch and softness and soo hard to stop eating.< /text>

<text>We are here for 6 mths and stumbled upon this gem.  My boyfriend is a huge chicken marsala and parmigiana fan.  He states theirs is the finest he's ever had and this is after our trip to Italy!  Oscar is a fantastic representative of this restaurant, we enjoy his company.   Great sangria and amazing spot on main street. Just magical!  We've made it our weekly night out.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Simply the best Italian restaurant in Ventura county. Food is yum, yum!!! They have Special deals with dinners,  salads,  tiramisu and wine. Their prices are unbeatable. The service was super good. Would recommend this place.</text>

<Text>I came here just before the pandemic.  I went again today as a treat to myself for donating blood.  The outside area was fully equipped for serving customers safely outside.  There is plenty of seating outdoors.  Paper menus are used and I observed staff cleaning tables and chairs.  I had the crab canneloni and, as usual, it was fabulous.

Staff, as always, are friendly and helpful and I will be back!  Eat local!< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Pretty good Italian place. Great seating with view of downtown traffic and people. The food was great but I went on a busy Friday and felt like it was rushed a bit. I feel it would have been better during the weekday when they are a bit slower.  This isn't a complaint as the open kitchen is very small. Very efficient and food was timely. Prices are decent and portions are large. I split a meal and had an appetizer with someone else and still have a significant amount of food leftover. I will return for sure</Review>< pictures>

Great downtown location. Service was fast. I really enjoyed my meal but my husbands tomato pasta with sausage was quite flavorless so he was disappointed. I liked that they brought bread at the beginning and they will keep bringing you parmesan cheese for your meal if you ask them. The creme brulee and alfredo were good, so was the italian soda.< /review>

<text>Amber greeted us as we entered Capriccio and quickly brought fresh bread and our drinks. She made sure that our lunch was prepared exactly as we requested. She checked back as we enjoyed each course and especially that our special request was as we ordered. The meal was delicious and we enjoyed our birthday celebration at this wonderful Ventura restaurant that Amber made so special.</text>< pics>

<username>Malcolm Cain<//username><Text>Oh my gosh, the food was incredible! The first item they serve is the freshly baked Bread.  It was served hot and tasted great.  Marian our server was extremely nice and prompt.   Extremely efficient at her job.  The calamari was fresh and the sauce enhanced the flavor.  The special menu Sea Bass was a delight.  The tomatoes and onions on the plate were so good.</Text><response>None</response><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

The legit kind of place that gives you free bread and grates the parmesan right in front of you. The seafood alfredo was bomb.< /Review>

Came in several months ago on a whim  and was "wowed" by the exceptional service and delicious food.  We came back today to celebrate a birthday and we were as impressed with the attentiveness of our server and the great food offered.  This is a place to return to for sure.</text>

Do not waste your money. So overpriced for what you get. And what you get is just basic. Shrimp from a frozen bag and over salty food.  This place used to have the BEST food. I think it switched owners. Oh well.< /Text>

<text>Yummy pizzas, pastas, sandwiches, and salads. The salads are amazing! Delicious dressings like apple vinaigrette, balsamic vinaigrette, and others. They add figs, cranberries, nuts, apples, and many more to dress up the salad. They also have a good sangria with chopped up fresh fruit. They have a very good wine selection including an excellent Valpoliceli. The service is smiling and happy except for the guy... he doesn't smile :) Stop in and give them a try.< /text><gmap_id>0x80e9acf228b73101:0x80868e88ca9a4752<//gmap_id>< pictures>

This place is wonderful - a surprising ‘gem’ with a great chef/owner, Jojo. He made us feel very welcome, as did our waiter Norma. Portions were just right; the sauces on both pasta dishes were great. Save room for the tiramisu - it is heavenly! I ate her the other night after the movies and it was fantastic. the service and food were excellent. The wait staff were fun and attentive. I tried one of their specials and I would have it again and aging.< /Text>

<Text>This is without a doubt my favorite restaurant. I have been eating there for 18 years. The ambience is very inviting. The food is wonderful. My favorite is the steamed mussels. I don’t know how they make the broth but I can drink it all up.< /Text><Response>None</Response>< Rating>

Been coming here for years & it's always been fantastic. I haven't made my way through the full menu yet, but I don't think I've ever gotten something that wasn't incredible. Very reasonable prices, friendly servers, wonderful ambiance. Perfect for every occasion< /text>

This place was a bust for me.  The meal started out well.  Arugula, beet and Gorgonzola cheese salad; all things I like.  The bread had rosemary in it and it could have been baked on site, good.  For my entry I had something from their special menu.  Lamb and pasta with red sauce.  This last thing turned me off.  First was the lamb, what little there was of it was not good, and I usually love lamb.  The pieces were fatty and chewy.  The pasta came out of a box.  But beyond all of this, it was swimming in sauce, see picture.  The other thing that turned me off was there was a large party celebrating a birthday (about 20 folks) and they all had to pass by me and hit the rest room, before heading out.

The service itself was fine, despite having to wait on the 20 some crew.  There was only one guy cooking and he was putting together the salads and everything else and getting it out in a timely manner.  The restaurant space is small; very narrow space but deep.<//text>

< Review>
We have been going to Capriccio Restaurant in Ventura for the five years we have lived in the area even though it is a 40 minute ride from our house.  They serve very large portions of very tasty italian food.

Usually we have not made reservations but since we were with another couple I made reservations.  It was a good thing as shortly after we were seated the tables were all occupied.

This is the first time we were there since the management change.  All of us were very happy with our meals.  I thought my food was at least as good as in the past.</Review>

Do you want to visit Italy in a day?  Then enjoy a meal at Capriccio.   Coming from an Italian family, I'm picky about my restaurant choices and they get my 5 stars.  The food is fresh, out of this world and just like grandma use to make.  And, the atmosphere is old world where you instantly feel you've left the country!  Love this place and highly recommend it.< /text>

Consistently very good food and service. The BBQ chopped chicken salad and the Margarita pizza were excellent. On a side note, the large homeless population and the local governments lack of leadership in addressing it make the Ventura business district an overall unpleasant place to visit. Had to cross the street to avoid an agitated homeless woman and the public bathroom had some homeless guy camped out, shaving and changing inside.<//review>

For the most part I enjoyed my lunch there recently. My waitress was friendly, it wasn't too crowded and my food was really good. My only issue is that I feel when you go to an Italian restaurant that with every meal you should automatically get a salad and bread with it. It bothered me that if I wanted a side-salad, that you had to pay more for it. I am from the East Coast where Italian food is on every street corner and where you could always be sure that bread and salad came with your meal. Other than that, I do recommend you at least give it a try.< /Text>

Been coming here for years. We travel from Bakersfield to have lunch or dinner. So far there is not one dish we have not liked. Staff is friendly and very helpful. Went yesterday 5-14-18 and meet the new owner Joe-Joe very friendly and knowledgeable of fine dining. Will continue to go back again and again.<//Text>

When we stay in Ventura , it’s one of our stops. The food is amazing. The service is excellent. Amber was our server, she is great. Addicted to the dolce di platanto.< /Text>

<text>If you work in Easy Hollywood and thought you couldn’t throw a meatball and hit a decent Italian place. Capriccio brings an authentic and warm-hearted slice of Italy. The food is simply okay and not extraordinary. There are variety of appetizers, pastas and entrees to choose from the menu. The staff were welcoming & accommodating. Every one that we came in contact with were friendly & helpful. The restaurant has outdoor seating for those who crave the scenery on Vermont ave.; its interior decor is decorated with different variety of large canvases.<//text>< pics>

<response>None</response><Review>Had to wait for 20 minutes for a smaller table,(even with our reservations) then they invented one just inside the front door where all that entered got to watch me eat. 10 inches to my left was a patron at another table , so everyone that was entering or leaving the restaurant got to "bump and grind" us on their way through. Food was tasty, but not near enough for a dinner. I think there was 3 small chunks of chicken in my fettuccine alfredo.
I won't be going back, even if the food was free.</Review>< user>

It feels like a family owned restaurant. They'll take care of you as soon as you're seated. There are a lot of food choices. On Tuesday nights they have specials where you can get dinner, wine and dessert together for a good price. I ended up ordering seafood pasta from the menu (not the special) and it was delicious! I think there was more seafood than pasta? Wow. I also got a side salad and they substituted the romaine lettuce with a garden style leaf lettuce (and told me beforehand) because of the scare at that time; so considerate!<//Review>

We've been coming here since they opened 20(?) years ago and it never disappoints! By far one of my favorite restaurants ever, and I don't know how they keep the prices so low. Always excellent food, service and atmosphere 😊<//review>

<Text>We stopped here for lunch and really enjoyed ourselves.

The restaurant is nice, quiet, and cozy. While only one of the diners would say their meal was unparalleled, the other three noshers could agree that their meals were quite delicious.

We will be back for sure.< /Text>< Pics>

It's a very quaint place with delicious food. Bread is homemade & baked everyday. Most of the pasta is also made from scratch & made everyday. I loved their Bolonese sauce, it is to "die" for. We also tried their pesto fettuccine & their veggie lasagna, very delicious. Will definitely be back. Owner JoJo is a doll, great personality.<//review>

Best restuarant ever!!! We ordered our food through Doordash ... it arrived with a couple things missing! We called the restaurant, but fortunately was unable to refund us for the items that were missing as the restuarant doesnt get paid from DH for a week! The owner of the restaurant got on the phone and offered us many options to correct the error! Ultimately she remade one of our meals and and personally delivered it along with our soup to our hotel room!! About 15 minutes later she called us to make sure that everything was to our satisfaction!!! WHAT AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE and AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS FOOD!!<//text>

This place is good.  My friends love it.  The Alfredo is not as thick as I would like and it is VERY cramped inside.  That being said it is a romantic restaurant for a night out.  I gave this place 3 stars due to, in my opinion, Spasso and Ferraro's having better Italian food in Ventura.</Text>

Capriccio's is my favorite restaurant  for Italian food downtown. It's small and quaint with great service and happy staff. Great place for locals and tourists alike. Their pizzas are thin crust and so yummy baked in a real Pizza Oven. Try their dessert platter afterwards ...you won't leave hungry that's for sure! They have  few tables outside if you don't mind the foot traffic and people watching. Give it a try,  you won't be sorry.<//review>

<Text>If you like American Italian or just great comfort food, this is the place to go. Everything was fresh and flavorful. Diet be damned!

The staff was friendly and prompt. The bread was warm and delicious.

My 4 yo had cheese pizza and loved it even though he is in his I only want mac and cheese stage.

I had the crab canaloni; the lobster sauce was the best I have had, the portion was huge as well and for only $13.00...  My husband had the fettuccini alfredo and shared a lemon tart both tasted amazing.

Looking forward to my leftovers and another visit.< /Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

The food and service was really good. Salmon with cream sauce and chorizo pizza. The chicken seared salad was also good.< /Text>

<review>Pricy! Bland taste. Not consistent in the taste of the dishes. Small restaurant-they really need to expand. Its very uncomfortable to sit at tables sometimes especially when it's busy. Staff is not friendly-rude sometimes depending on who it is. Pasta, risotto, bread, salad, desserts, pizzas are all okay. Not the best.</review>< Pics>

<Review>The wait is long due to popularity. Plan on time to wait 20 -30 minutes at peak hours. Dont go starving. Food is delicious  . Marinara sauce is different from traditional whole tomato. Texture is more a sauce liquid, no tomato pieces. Main dishes are flavorfull. Appetizers are filling and good taste. Calamari is lightly seasoned, sometimes chewy. May need to salt to taste. Servers are friendly and give good attention to your meals. Wine selection  variety is great.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>The vegetable lasagna was supposed to include yellow squash, zucchini and bell peppers. There were no bell peppers nor yellow squash but rather two tasteless mystery vegetables, maybe artichoke and eggplant. I was looking firwfor to a meal full of veggues but not so.The  amount of cheese was overwhelming. The sauce was more creamy than marinara as listed.  The bread was warm but served without butter or olive oil. Our meals were served quickly and the waiters super attentive.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Went there for Valentine's Day ordered a Sirloin Steak, came with twice baked potato And Asparagus, food was cold before even was served, steak was suppose to be medium well with little pink, almost rare baked potato was absolutely cold and asparagus was not cooked hard and cold. I ordered a red wine asked waiter the different in their taste, said well one is heavier then the other never offered a sample. Steaks will never buy there again Pasta are much better. I should sent all the food back next time when food is cold will send all it back. What should been a nice evening was such a disappointment for food.< /Text>

As everything escalates they are bordering on inexpensive. 4 of us for dinner tonight. Sea Bass, Lamb Shank, pizza and Linguini All Vongole. Tasted everything. Just finished a cold piece of pizza 2 hours after we finished. Everythin, including the cold pizza, was top shelf. Hard to beat at any price but then you get the bill. Whoa. $100  for 4 of us is damn near a bargain given the quality of the meal. Don't forget dessert. I'm partial to the Spumoni but the flowerless Chocolate Raspberry  Cake<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Rating>2</Rating><Review>I really think the chef doesn't have much of a pallet, because the food was inedible. The Caesar salad was so salty...blech! Calamari was overcooked-chewy. Didn't wait for the entree to be delivered.< /Review><userid>101829324975516781528< /userid><response>None<//response></record>

<Text>This was perfect after a day spent at Warped Tour. Especially in comparison to the food at Warped, this place was phenomenal. The service was good and they knew we were from out of town and treated us well. Its in a good part of town thats not too crazy and theres bars nearby if youre bouncing around.</Text><GmapID>0x80e9acf228b73101:0x80868e88ca9a4752</GmapID><time>1530312116810< /time>< Rating>

<review>Meraviglioso! Molto delizioso! We’d never been here before, but now I love this place. The food and service were exceptional. We had the Cannelloni and Penne Puttanesca. Both were delicious. The ambiance was pleasant (although the music could have been a touch louder) and our server was nice, attentive, and helpful. We usually don’t have dessert when we have a meal, but it was my birthday (which our waitress picked up on). In addition to our desserts I was also treated to a slice of tiramisu and a hearty rendition of “Happy Birthday,” which was quite nice. Will I go here again? You can bet on it, I will.< /review><rating>5<//rating><user_name>Robert</user_name><Date>1534114750289< /Date>< UserId.>

< review>
went in pm of march 26, 2016.  food was OK but linguini and clams was served with "baby" clams that had no meat inside.  glass of wine at about 3 oz costs $7.00.  our male waiter (about 50) was rude, had an attitude, and rushed us.  would think twice about going again.  better choice....go to ferroro's to the east.< /review>

A must-stop Ventura place for its  Inexpensive, top notch food (the owner managed a number of places and took his favorite dishes from each one)... retro, airy, high ceiling, historic building ...  cioppino  and blackened cajun chicken salad are the best picks< /text>

In the past, this place would have gotten 5 stars out of me. I think they've lowered the quality of their food, and their staff leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. It may just be me, and it may just have been a bad night - but I definitely think there's better food out there. Location is real nice though.<//text>

< Review>
I had a guest meet me for dinner here 5-19-2021.  Both of us left pretty disappointed because of the food.  The breading on the chicken piccata was mushy; the sauce was more of a capellini soup.  I order this dish from every restaurant when it's offered– it's a favorite.  I didn't even finish my meal.  My guest was disappointed in bland seasoning for his seafood dish in a tomato sauce.  He had to add a generous amount of salt and pepper so that it had any flavor (he said to me as he dumped it in). The service was decent; it was hilarious to see "20%, 30%, 40%" as options for a gratuity.  Service was 18% worthy, as items were forgotten and the entire time the server had to keep running back and forth.  My guest finished his gorgonzola salad before the extra dressing was delivered.  The bruschetta was good.  Sadly the flavors of the meals just don't do the photos of menu items justice (online).  I chose this restaurant because a friend once worked here.  We have no plans to return.</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Outstanding experience. Everything was delicious and very reasonable price.
Best Italian food I've ever had, service was phenomenal! I will be back soon. Vegetable salad I have never eaten before. Friendly staff I will come back again ... I recommend this restaurant is not disappointed.

Outstanding experience. Everything was delicious and very reasonable price.
Best Italian food I've ever had, service was phenomenal! The staff was prompt and courteous, the atmosphere friendly and relaxed. I will be back soon. เป็นอีกหนึ่งร้านอาหารอิตาเลี่ยนที่ฉันชื่นชอบ อาหารอร่อย ฉันชอบพิชช่าหน้าสลัดผัก แสนอร่อยที่ฉันไม่เคยทานมาก่อน พนักงานใจดีเป็นกันเอง ฉันจะกลับมาอีกครั้ง...แนะนำร้านนี้เลยว่าไม่ผิดหวัง<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWcp4jpThYhFrllSNycdP10Ezd4DnVX2PHBRRH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80e9acf228b73101:0x80868e88ca9a4752< /gmapID></record>

Daniel & his co worker assisted us by loading our moving van. There was a flight of stairs & some heavy furniture & boxes involved. They did a great job! They worked really hard for 4 hrs. & we’re reasonably priced. Daniel is also an excellent Handyman. I highly recommend them!<//text>

We have used Ask-A-Task on multiple projects and Daniel is always prompt, clean and fast. He is our go-to for small projects (this time installing a dishwasher for us) or bigger projects like replacing siding. I highly recommend him whenever I can and he never lets me down for all types of projects. Thanks Daniel!</text>

Very unprofessional. Takes a job and does not show up. An hour after he was supposed to be here I text to ask if he is coming or what happened. Only response was "family emergency". No further communication than that. He shouldn't take on jobs he has no intention of showing up too or even take 2 secs to send me a text letting me know he couldn't make it! I would of been more forgiving. According to Facebook I am not the only person this has happened to. So just be warned.</Review>

<Text>Ask a Task is our “go to” for our tasks around our house . We first used Daniel back in Sept 2020 when we saw his ad on Facebook. He came over to give us a quote on the tasks we needed completed. Power wash, repair gutter, replace broken screens, and replace an old mailbox. He gave us an amazing quote and we scheduled a date. We were so satisfied with the quality of his work and professionalism, we talked about the idea of painting the outside of our home.

Come October, Ask A Task made it happen at an amazing price. We communicated a week prior and planned accordingly. Ask A Task gave our house a brand new look. We were even able to add on their service of replacing our porch light. After the house was painted we talked about prices for doing a temporary and affordable fix to our old deck that was giving our kids splinters.  A week later he was able to make our deck look and feel much better with deck over. That too was an amazing transformation. A few weeks later we scheduled holiday lights to be hung up and cleaning of gutters.

End of November, Ask A Task comes through and amazes us. Now for the first time we had Christmas lights hung up on the outside of our house.  He also fixed an outside outlet while he was at it so that we didn’t have to run extension chords through the garage.

Now it’s January and we knew we wanted to begin the new year on a lighter load and a brighter future. We booked Ask A Task for a dump run, and replace light fixtures in our kitchen. They arrived on time that was given, loaded up their trailer with our pile of junk, took down Xmas lights, and replaced 2 light fixtures.  Replacement lights are so nice and clean, and now we have much more space in our garage thanks to their dump run service.

Daniel & Daniel are the best. Communication is great. Quality of work is amazing. Prices are unbeatable.  These guys are super friendly and get the work done.

If you need a task done, Ask A Task is there to help.

Check him out and give him a call or text. You won’t be disappointed.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Gmap_id>

If I could give 6 stars, I would. These gentlemen showed up to a large junk removal task. My first thought was there was no way they could get it done, but sure enough they not only got it done, but in a timely manner. Super affordable rates. We also laughed our tears off!!! You can’t go wrong with these guys!!< /review>

<text>Daniel at Ask-A-Task is a very professional business man, who takes pride in his work. He spends the required amount of time to complete every job thoroughly and meticulously. His pricing quotes are extremely reasonable and the time he spends on your job is utilized completely. He is very responsive, reliable, honest and hard-working which are qualities hard to come by these days. He offers quality work and options for many projects. I am always more than pleased with the final results and attention to detail. In the many years of my career it has been a challenge to find a handy-man who pays attention to detail and completes the job within a specified time frame. I have referred him to many people to complete tasks and they have all had positive feedback. I highly recommend Ask-A-Task for all your odd-jobs and handyman needs!</text>< pictures>

<review>Daniel of Ask-A-Task has been an incredible resource to me and my clients. He has a wide range of skill and can accomplish any repair or home improvement project we’ve requested, he’s always on time, super professional and always accommodating. I’m a local Realtor and have used Daniel in a range of task from landscaping to building a pergola. I appreciate his pricing and ability to fit us into his schedule in a pinch. My clients always love his friendly nature and ‘can do’ attitude. HIGHLY recommend Daniel and Ask-A-Task for your next project!< /review>< pics>

Had Daniel come out and quote a small fence project, his price was was under budget and he went straight to work. Since then I’ve had him back to do about 3 other projects. Each time he fit within my budget, went right to work and completed said projects with success. Very happy with his work and will continue to refer him to anyone needing stuff done around the house. Great customer service and quality of work was top notch.< /review>

Daniel from ask a task was great! I needed someone last minute to haul away some materials from a recent home project. I called him and he was at my home very quickly and was extremely professional and courteous. He far exceeded my expectations! I will be using him for sure in the near future and will be referring any friends to him that can use his services!<//review>

Daniel has helped me with a few projects around our property. Fair pricing, hard working, dependable and an all around great experience! Thank you Daniel! If you’re like me and don’t have time to get to things, give Ask-A-Task a call. You won’t be disappointed.</review>

I’ve owned my own salon for years and he’s able to help me there and also being single and on my own it’s nice to feel comfortable having him do work at my home as well. Worth its weight In gold having a good reliable handyman and works on cars too. Will not be disappointed 👍🏼< /review>< pictures>

I've been needing some deck repair done, today was the last day I could do it. Every one I called all week kept saying if something frees up they would call, no one did except Daniel with Ask-A-Task.  I knew he was tied up all week and really couldn't fit me in on Sunday, but he did. Not only did he right over after another job he did it in the hottest part of the day.  He was incredibly polite and thorough he kept telling me he was grateful for my business.  I was absolutely amazed of his work ethic and knowledge of the job he even charged me 400 dollars less than anyone else's bid for doing it on a work day. I used him before and now I know there isn't any reason to go anywhere else. I am 150 percent satisfied with his work and felt incredibly grateful he actually came over on a Sunday.  If anyone has any questions about this gentleman, please feel free to contact me on here.
Thank you Daniel<//Review>

After a weekend of cleaning up the garage, we needed to make a dump run. Reached out to Daniel to see if this was something he could do; he was here and gone within the hour! Could not have asked for better service with an unbeatable price!</Review>

I visited this facility because it was recommended to me as the nearest property having 10' X 10' units available, which is what I was seeking. I met Mia at the reception. She was extremely courteous and thorough with the entire process. It took me a while to understand the details as this was my first time renting public storage but, Mia was very patient and like a pro guided me through all the steps. She even helped me download and activate the app on my phone that I could then use to access this facility. My experience here has been great!

I would highly recommend this facility to anyone reading this review and looking to rent storage units.<//text>

< review>
CUSTOMER SERVICE IS DEAD.
Politeness is not customer service, it is common curtesy. Doing a job is not customer service, it is mandatory for compensation based on an employee/employer agreement. Customer service is not telling a customer that a system is the cause of not being able to take action. Otherwise, we need only to rely on technology and robots without the use of humans. Actual customer service should supersede a system because a human is suppose to recognize and do what a system cannot. This location does not understand this concept, but are they blameless because many other places also lack this ability? To say I am disappointed is an understatement. Customer service is what rights wrongs but when it is not exercised, what remains in lasting form is only the wrong that was committed. The system is set up to always win, and will fail the customer if it is followed without regard to human error. Humans should have the basic compassion to manually correct human and system errors. We need more than just robots in electronic and flesh form. Public Storage, thanks for asking how I really feel, because regardless of whether you care or not... this will be stated: you need to do better. Stop using people robots for calls and email. Have genuine customer service in place at your locations. Be able to take proper action that benefits the customer too. Customers are what make a business, so do not do them wrong just because you are a larger company. There’s enough trash out here. Believe me, it is not too difficult and is better for business and average business ratings. All I kindly asked several (more than once) times is for basic customer service to be exercised for something that your company did wrong, not even me! and that was simply too complicated for your robot system or robot humans to recognize. I am bereaved at the loss of customer service as a whole in this modern time and the proof was displayed from this past week through your company, Public Storage. I would ask you to “take action”, but that would likely overload your system of robots (electronic or human) because they will not understand what that means. What a useless battle this has been. Future patrons: do not be surprised by a bit trash in units (from above or on the side) and piss smelling elevators for 2nd/3rd floor accessing patrons.</review>

<text>This storage facility is always immaculate. We have been using it for two years now.
The staff is always professional and courteous, especially Mia.
She is friendly beyond words and goes out of her way to help whenever she can. As much as we begged her, she would not accept a tip. So, at her insistence, we’re leaving this review instead.
Thank you!</text></record>

Evelyn is the best! Professional, great demeanor, fun and friendly, we decided we are going to be best friends.

Laughing so hard, such an awesome time here.

Great price, super clean. She closed the deal!

And we got an awesome space to store our stuff. Looking forward to seeing here when we come by!

Thanks so much!< /Text>

I politely asked if I could charge my phone in the lobby while I waited for my Uber. The employee working here said ‘that isn’t a service we offer our customers.’ I said ‘can I use this outlet right here’. She said ‘no sir, I’m very uncomfortable right now.’

I’m a paying customer at this business and I can’t charge my phone in the lobby for 5 minutes?!? Why am I being treated like a homeless person lol.< /Review>

I have been at this location since 2011 & have noted many different storage agents ... (I also have been A Flt Attendant 4 over 48 yrs 4 United Airlines), this is my way of saying ‘that’ I know what good customer service “IS”.  Joy personifies “Good” CS...she’s smart, knows her product, listens, gives U info that U would not know 2 ask, she’s professional, kind & from what I have observed,  a hard worker & best of all...she’s consistent!!!  U have a true diamond...I appreciate all her efforts.    Thanks 4 listening.< /review>

I highly recommend this Storage facility.Great customer service and clean facility.I had a major problem after Christmas in losing my keys to my storage space.Associate Miguel acted fast in what was supposed to be a 2 week wait for technicians to change my lock.He got it done in a couple of hours which made my day.The other associates are always kind as well<//Review>

Very clean facility. Friendly helpful staff. Furniture movers available if you have your ID. Multi-level but large elevators. Key-code entry only. Clean bathrooms. Close to the freeway. Reasonably priced.</Text>

Great location between two modern office buildings at the Western Avenue exit off the 405 Freeway. Seems like new construction compared to the El Segundo Public Storage location. Entire building is air condtioned so you won't be sweating your nuts off while loading or unloading.<//review>

Went there to buy some boxes for moving and the lady at the front believe her name was JOY. She was amazing from greeting me when I entered, to helping me figure out the size boxes I needed, to getting me the exact price. I'ts the little things that matter in making a store feel welcoming.</text>

<text>I had my unit broken into... only to find out from the police officer that 7 units had been broken into ... And that it happens frequently at this facility. I guess since it doesn’t hurt them financially they don’t make changes to protect their customers. The “ceiling” is wire mesh that the thieves just cut through and go from unit to unit. If I were you I would find a storage unit with solid roof or be prepared to have your stuff stolen at some point. I had only been with them 5 months when this happened. I can tell the front desk people are embarrassed but really can’t do much about it. Other than that I have no problem with this facility :-/<//text>< Pictures>

<text>Very clean, all indoors, staff very helpful. The only complaint is the garage door seems to break a lot.
Very inconvenient to haul you stuff up the ramp. And if your elderly it almost impossible.</text>< Date>

I am a returning customer.   I have always liked my Public Storage experience at this location.  But I wanted to make a special effort to commend both Arlene and Danielle for how they made my return pleasant, easy and efficient.  Great attitudes!  Great service!   I recommend this facility, and these employees, to anyone who is looking for a clean, secure, well managed storage facility.< /text>

Earlier this morning went to this Public Storage on 190th. If I could give 10/10 I would cause Rita was awesome! She was very informative about my options w/ the units but she didn’t pressure me into getting just anything; which is key. Helping me setup my online account, to going over every detail w/ me, to showing me how everything works she was great! I couldn’t have asked for a better experience. That’s not to say the other guys/girls there weren’t great, but she took care of me from beginning to end. Anytime I need anything I’ll be looking for Rita! Thank you again I really appreciate.

This location is newly built, still being painted when I came to rent storage. I really needed a space for a good price and fast. Nieshia and Arlene came to the rescue. They were both very friendly and helpful in offering me a space that both fit my needs and my pockets. Did I mention they were fast, because I was in and out in under 18 mins.< /Review>

When I arrived one of the male workers tried to tell me the price of the unit was not going to be the same as the price I had reserved it for, despite having the reservation. Nieshia quickly stepped in to help us and ensure us that they were able to do a price adjustment. She was proactive and overall very helpful! Units are clean.<//text>

<review>Great customer service and a great location to store your valuables. It's right off the 405 freeway which gives easy access. The place being air conditioned is a plus with the ability to load and unload in an indoor-docking bay. Which means, you don't have to worry about the rain or what not. The workers are so helpful and pleasant. They always say hi when you come in. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.< /review>< Name>

Today I must say that Arlene and Nieshia was a great help I came and was in need of a storage they went above and beyond to make sure that my need was met these two girls had excellent customer service I would recommend storing at this location and ask for them. The moment I receive the call for my reservation I felt like I already knew Nieshia she made me feel welcome over the phone.<//review>

<review>Arlene and Kody were excellent and I got a great move in deal! Bring a Lantern, the units are dark. No overhead lighting since they couldn't get to it to replace a bulb or electricity. I wish the office opened earlier but oh well. Still a great deal and a clean safe place!< /review>< Pictures>

Zero star, unit was sold before without my consent. No notification was send out that this was happen. Manager Derik is thief beware. Not a safe place no cameras around units so is easily to break in and steal or put in another unit. This location needs to be shut down and all staff should be pursuit for criminal acts. Please stay away from this place</text>

<review>The customer service at this Public Storage location was extraordinary. Upon my visit, an associate by the name of Adie provided services for us and she was excellent! She made sure that we were pleased with our storage rental and provided assistance to reassure that it met our storage needs!  She truly cared about customer satisfaction! She was friendly, professional, and made us feel so comfortable! She made the environment so warm and welcoming for us and other customers. We came in so stressed from all of the moving we were doing lately and she was so helpful! Wow, this type of customer service is a breath of fresh air! I would recommend this location to anyone looking for a welcoming, stress free, and accessible storage facility. Also the covered parking lot for customer loading is splendid. I am a customer that is well pleased:)</review>< pictures>

OFF THE CHARTS CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! By far, the best storage experience ever!  The staff went above and beyond to accommodate me. From locking myself out (twice), to their friendly and supportive attitudes- this location rocks! if I need another space, this is the place for me!  Thank you Adie & Raul for an awesome experience!<//text>

<review>Great storage rooms!  Don't access my storage too often, forgot how to open the locked sliding door.  Brandon from the office helped me and showed me how easy it is open the sliding door and yes, the lock does come out so you can slide the lock to an unlock position.
Everyone in the office very helpful and nice.  Great customer service!<//review><Rate>5<//Rate>< resp>

Excellent in every way. This nearly new facility is 10 miles from my home but well worth the extra distance. The facility has passcode security for the elevators and storage units are accessible 15 hours a day 7 days a week. Climate controlled and very clean. The staff have been extremely helpful through the move in process and when I needed to change from a medium to a large storage unit and also to arrange for cart access outside of business hours many times. There is a large lighted area inside building to load and unload which has never been full when I visited. There is a large parking lot at the front of the building so space is never a problem. A large selection of boxes and other supplies are available for purchase. I cannot think of anything to improve. Thanks.</review>

<Text>Excellent customer service and facility. I have been to a couple of storage facilities and by far this one has been the cleanest and most organized of all. I was impressed on how welcoming the employees were as soon as I open the door, they greet you with a smile  which is always nice to see. I can say that this facility has great customer service, Maria the employee that helped me was explicit with her answers and  let me tell you I had a lot of questions and she sure answered every single one thoroughly and with a smile. I would truly recommend this facility for it's clean and has great customer service.</Text>< pics>

I don’t like their process of taking our license when we want to borrow a dolly because the workers be leaving on break or something and by the time we’re finished storing, there’s no one at the office to give us our license back so we have to wait and that’s not right. What if we’re in a rush and have somewhere to go? They need to switch off workers or something during breaks so there will always be someone in the office. Also, the workers should not close storage until they received all of their dollies back because they’re holding everyone’s licenses. There have been cases where all the workers just leave without reaching out to the people borrowing the dollies then all the doors be locked and people can’t get their licenses back until the next day. They need a better system. This one is not it! Don’t take people’s licenses or get better workers!< /Review>

<Text>Raul. This one is for you and Valerie.

Facility is outstanding, enclosed loading/unloading area with easy access to the elevators. Units themselves are in a controlled environment and well lit and well ventilated. Units are accessible from 6am to 9pm. My other unit with a competitor costs me more, 7-7 access and isn't as nice. The staff that I dealt with (Raul and Valerie) were very professional and very friendly.

Pros:
-lovely staff and not just to look at
-enclosed loading/unloading area.
-great units
-competitive price

Cons:
-proprietary locks required
-you don't get to set your own access code to the elevators and the process is a bit awkward.
-They won't let me move into my unit.... I even said please.<//Text>< Pics>

I enjoy coming into storage bc we always have a good laugh.

Public Storage needs more Nieshia across the country bc of her good attitude and happy personality.

Thank you for having fabulous employees like Nieshia!

GREAT customer service, always greeted with a smile, as the staff is very helpful! The facility is very clean, and well-maintained. I actually have a public storage two blocks from my house, but because this location has climate control, conveniently supplied carts for item transportation, and most importantly as I mentioned before, EXCELLENT customer service, I do not mind driving the extra mile. I would highly recommend this location to anyone and everyone looking for a place that is safe and secure for their belongings.</Text>

<review>Excellent customer service and facility. I have been to a couple of storage facilities and by far this one has been the cleanest and most organized of all. I was impressed on how welcoming the employees were as soon as I open the door, they greet you with a smile and cordiality which is always nice to see. I can say that this facility has great customer service, Bristy the employee that helped me was super nice with her answers . I had a lot of questions and she sure answered every single one thoroughly and with a smile. I would truly recommend this facility for it's clean and has great customer service.<//review>< pictures>

I had to move quickly and wanted a place that was close to my new living location in Hermosa Beach. This location was perfect! It was easy to get to bc it’s off a main road and close to the 405, it was so clean and the ladies in the office Arlene & Nieshia were so sweet and a pleasure to meet when I was getting my unit set up! I would def rent here again. Thanks!</text>

They are always friendly & helpful! We moved to the area about 2 years ago & chose this location because it was indoors, not too far from home, has convenient hours, and it is clean. It took us a while to decide where to store our household goods since we moved into a smaller house from out-of-state.  We are very happy that we chose this location!  All of the storage facilities closer to our house were not climate controlled, cost more & usually drive-up type.  (We had a drive up storage in Spokane & although it can be easier, it was humid & musky even though it was a brand new facility. Plus we had so many bugs at that one!) I will definitely chose indoor facilities from now on, just like this one!!!

Adie has been there to help us out since we started.  They contacted us at the first sign of something possibly leaking by our unit, luckily nothing was damaged or leaking inside, but it is good to know they actually take a look at things!  It is easy to drive up close to get things in & out.  They offer carts free of charge to use which is very helpful, I use them almost every time I go there. Every associate has always been helpful & courteous.

It is located right off of the 405, close to shopping & not far from my husband's job.  It is never too crowded to find close parking.  I would recommend this location!< /Review>

<review>Well first and for most i loved the old workers that use to be here they had extremely good customer service. (  Adie )

Now in 2019 your staff aren't to friendly very lazy and they act like the Don't want to work. The orher weekend i came with my fiance and he had to use the restroom they didnt want to open it for him and then as soon as i arrived they opened the restroom for me. Now today once again you worker Niesha is very rude and we dound a crack pipe on the ground that they acted like they didnt want to pick up. I have a picture of it and im sending it to the corporate office< /review>< Date>

I am very disappointed in my experience here. When I got my storage, I was not told that in 6 months, the price would increase 20%, which is almost a $60 increase for my storage unit. I've rented many storages in the past, including a different Public Storage, and I've never experienced this. Some storages such as U-Haul actually decreased the rate after a certain period as an incentive to keep customers who pay on time. When I called the corporate office to express my concerns, the representative told me that the contract I signed says, "subject to change" and therefore they are able to make an "executive decision" to raise rates 20%. This forces many customers to downsize (where the price will again increase in 6 months) or pay the higher rate, as it is a huge hassle to rent a truck and movers to move to a new storage. I feel that this practice is very unethical. I would not recommend this storage - there are many nice storages in the Gardena/ Redondo Beach area without this policy. It may also be helpful to look at the reviews of this storage on Yelp.</Review>

We have another unit at a different location. After speaking with the manager on duty,we discovered that this location had much less rates!! I sent my daughter in and rented a 5x5 to store her things. She said the staff was very nice and the location was super clean.< /text>

the storage place is close the price was right the building very clean and secure and the staff was great. my dealings were with a very bright and friendly employee named Adie. Her help and kindness was very much appreciated. in a world where you only see the top of peoples heads while they text it was nice to see a smile and eyes. thank you ..Ray King<//review>

Called in and made a last minute request to see some available storage units and spoke with Andie. She was great and friendly over the phone. When I showed up to meet with Andie she was just fantastic totally super friendly and very helpful answered all my questions with ease and was just perfect in everyway possible I swear she is small but so adorable and so beyond sweet I swear I would totally put her in my pocket and take her home with me if i could but obviously that would be impossible but again if you need help she would be the go to person for great info, insight and help. Was totally worth checking out and yes i did sign up for a storage unit just for the simple fact of Andie being so lovable and great! Thanks Andie so much for everything you are perfect in everyway imaginable and a dream to be an employee for any company...Public Storage should feel privileged to have someone like you working for them. ;)<//Text>

Nice place, nice staff.. the only thing I didn't like was that I was specifically told I didn't need to pay my rent until the 7th, due to a late move in. I specifically said AT THE TIME OF MOVE IN I was only renting for one month. So I go to close my account and I am told I need to pay second month because "their policy changed" and they didn't bother to let any of the customers know about this change(no email or phone call). So I had to pay an extra month just to close out my storage. Spoke with the manager, he said he would call back but never can seem to get ahold of him since the first talk I had with him over the phone.< /text>

Clean Friendly environment and Awesome service!
I wasn't sure what size I should get for the storage.
Adie helped me out to get the perfect size unit.
I've been using this facility ever since.

I have experienced some wonderful assistance from Adie on numerous occasions. She is one of the finest, most informed people I have ever dealt with. She seems to know the business here at Public Storage inside and out.  She must be an excellent asset to your company.  I wanted to take a moment to write a sterling review for her because she is worth every bit of it.< /review>< pictures>

Adie, Bristy, & Maria provided excellent customer service. The facility is clean, well maintained, and secure. I shopped around and the customer service is what sold me. These ladies were knowledgeable and made me feel like my needs were what mattered. By far the best storage experience I've had (and I have rented a lot of storage units.)</Text>

The facility is in terrific condition.  It's clean, bright, spacious, and well maintained.  And, it offers better pricing than almost all other locations which didn't seem quite as nice.  Plus, Adie, the manager, and her staff are all super friendly and willing to work with you if you have any important needs/concerns.  They are very easy to work with.  I would recommend this location to anyone needing a storage space.< /text>< pictures>

She listened very carefully to muy situation and my needs.  I ama realtor attempting to accommodate my client who is presently out of the area. My client is a existing customer of Pubic Storage.  Sandra was also helped to make a call to my office as i forgot my phone there.  In spite of nearing the closing time, she continued to exemplifying fantastic customer services. She even stayed longer to make sure I understood everything to process me. I would highly recommend Sandra and this location . Please be assured I checked several other companies and location.

Very great overall experience at this facility. Everything was clean, and the staff were wonderful! Adie, Maria, and Bristy took care of me, and answered all my questions, and addressed my concerns. I would recommend the facility to anyone needing storage solutions.  Was glad to find a place to put all my furniture from prior to my move. Maria showed me the space, and I left with all the info I needed. Thank you!!!< /review>

<review>Hi. My name is Tony and I brought my uncle Henry Gilbert who is well loved here. Adie has excellent service and makes people feel comfortable and at ease. She has a humorous nature and makes people laugh. She makes us wanna come here often. She is not just good but EXCELLENT. She makes you feel comfortable when you talk to her. If Public Storage wants to promote then it should be Adie because she deserves all that and more. She has a smile that makes the sun shine. Thank you for everything Adie.<//review>< Response>

When I signed up for this storage space at the end of 2011 it was the best deal in the area.  I haven't priced units recently so I don't know if the price is still competitive.
I have a space on the 3rd floor.  Sometimes I have problems accessing the elevator but it just means having to input my password 2 or 3 times.
The bathroom on the 3rd floor does not work - it has not worked since I moved in.
There are no trash cans available, either.
I understand Public Storage might be concerned about a) the customers destroying the restroom, and b) dealing with dumping problems, but isn't that part of the business?
Adie is the manager in the office and has been there since I began renting while all the other employees have come and gone.  I hope Public Storage is paying her a decent wage because she deserves it!</review>

From the day I became a customer in July of 2012 Adie has been helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. She always has a pleasant smile on her face and always gives me words of encouragement. I am grateful for such a sweet and kind manager. Her staff always looks happy, the facility is always clean, and customers always seems to be satisfied. I would recommend this particular location to anyone I know. Keep up the awesome work Adie and the staff of public storage in Gardena, CA.<//text>

Adie : I just want to say of that Adie has helped me since 2012. I have been with this public storage for many years. I just really wanna say that I appreciate her in all ways. She has helped me above and beyond. I just wanna to let management know that Adie is a special person that has exceeded expectations.< /Review>

Thank you for all your help during 2013-2014.  You all are just great.  You are very professional and helpful.  I really like the cleanliness of the facility.  I do believe that all of you are executive material if that's an area you would like to pursue.

< Review>
Customer service Rep Antwone was extremely knowledgeable and very pleasant this past Saturday at this new location. My wife and I said that  Public Storage needs more customer service reps like Antwone who really went beyond the call of duty to get us setup with our new storage locker in Gardena... Thanks Antwone<//Review>

<text>This is an excellent storage facility! Everything is clean, well lit and easy to get in and out of. Adie, Bristy and Maria were very helpful and made a tough move much easier. I would definitely recommend using this facility if you are in need of a storage space. There's plenty of sizes to choose from and Adie was invaluable in helping me choose the right size for my needs.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

< Review>
Last year, when I was in need of a storage space, I had actually already reserved a space elsewhere when I happened to drive by the Public Storage on 190th St.  On a whim, I stopped by "just to see" what they had to offer.  Adie was the one who greeted me & enthusiastically shared information about their facility. It just so happened that there was a space available in a terrific location, too. I signed up immediately & cancelled my other reservation.  I have been completely happy w/this decision.  The staff is the BEST.  Always friendly & helpful!  The place sparkles w/their care.  Victor (also always smiling & friendly!) was polishing the elevator when I was there last week!  They all work very hard to keep the place spic & span!  The place is well-lit, temperature-controlled, & completely clean.  There are carts available (free rental) to ferry boxes & heavy items to your storage space.  There is also a nice restroom facility, & the office has packing materials for purchase.  It is the best place to store your things!  But the icing on the cake is the terrific staff who are always kind, caring, & helpful.  Heartwarming!  (P.S.  I stopped by there last week, & Adie knew me by name & my space number instantly, even though I had not seen her in a few months.  Talk about great customer service!!  She is amazing!)</Review>

<Text>I have been using storage facilities for about 8 years now and I when I opted recently to use the 1459 W 190th St, Gardena, CA as my new storage location, I didn't know that it was going to exceed my expectations I usually have when dealing with facility management.  As soon as I got there, Adie and Victor, greeted me with a smile and had a positive ability to go the extra mile to make sure a)they wanted my business and b)they wanted to keep my business.  I initially wanted a smaller unit but after Adie heard my needs she instantly recommended another better option for her available inventory that would best suit my needs.  I think I've been there about 5-6 months and I have never had a hassle getting in and out of the facility and the fact that they maintain it clean and spotless and have I think 8-10 X-Large carts available for you to use, they should have the option to give 10 stars instead of 5.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b559e99cb4d1:0x1e6dbc460936d457< /Gmap_id></record>

Andrea and Mike were the example of quality customer service. Thank you for exemplifying the Twelve Best Practices of Customer Service.

"The twelve best practices are found in companies that exemplify excellent customer service. These practices are not just something the company does, the practices are the company. Every employee in the company must understand and carry out these practices on a daily basis. Hiring people with the right attitudes and keeping them constantly trained, rewarded and recognized for demonstrating the best of these twelve practices is the way that companies achieve success. It is essential that the top person in the organization, CEO or owner also demonstrate these practices; not just among external customers, but among those internal customers, especially employees. Remembering that happy employees make happy customers is a critical bit of advice for every chief executive."

I had actually lost faith in the spirit of customer service. But, when I came to the Gardena Public Storage (190th Street,) that faith was restored.  Adie, Maria, Bristy, and Victor are outstanding.   I worked in a storage place in Seattle, WA and thought I gave great customer sevice, but these folks at the Gardena Public Storage (190th Street, outshined me by far.

I give the facility a AAA rating. I  give the staff a AAA+ rating.  They are off the charts.  ;-)< /Review>
