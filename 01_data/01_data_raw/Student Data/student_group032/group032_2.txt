My favorite store. I know Albertsons is a little more pricey but you cannot put a price on quality. The freshest fruits/vegetables/bakery/meats. The list goes on, sign up for the rewards to help you save some money and get deals on items you purchase often.</Text>

<Review>Tracy at the deli counter was amazing and professional when taking my order for a meat and cheese deli tray.  We need more courteous and respectful customer service like what she provided me with.  I will return only because she made my experience fantastic!🙌<//Review></record>

I haven't shopped with Albertson in years and now I remember why. They can't be bother to tell you till your paying that your phone number doesn't work for deals. To get any of their deals you have to download an app and search it up. You have to shop on their app before going shopping. Its so inconvenient for the customer. I dont have time to do that when shopping after work.. The cashier didn't bother to tell us until half way through the purchase. This is the last time I'm shopping here.< /review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>The staff is nice enough but the managment are a bunch of rocks. There is never an express lane open. I usually just end up going to the Walmart because they at least have self-checkout. A really poorly run store; the least convenient of all supermarkets in DB despite its great location.<//review>< GmapID>

<text>We visited at around 2:30pm on a Sunday and it was really busy during the pandemic. People went in and out. Masks required. It has a nice internal layout. The mall it is located in has many other shops worth visiting, such as a wonderful corner cafe with a fake British phone booth and a Korean fusion restaurant at the other end.<//text><Rating>5</Rating><date>1600194578464</date>< name>

They only had one register open while there were 10 customers waiting to pay. One cashier couldn’t wait to go home and didn’t want to help customers who were ready to check out. I was there on Sunday night around 6 pm and won’t return to shop anymore.< /text>

I like this store, it's nice and clean and the employees are pretty chill. They have a good selection of produce, although it's pretty pricey in comparison to Super King. But it's not bad for a place to run to for a few quick items.

They carried the specific cocoa powder I was looking for for my cupcakes, which was pretty cool. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because when I went to go get the egg roll wrappers here, all of them were expired many many months ago. There was a good 15 packages and all of them had expired over 6 months ago. That sucked.< /review>

I had a very bad experience yesterday at this store. Not sure why an employee is yelling at me from across the whole store.  couldn’t even hear her. It was so embarrassing everyone looking at me as if I did something wrong. I had wanted to buy cigarettes while checking out  and the employee ringing me up told me to go to the counter where cigarettes where to purchase. This is the second time this same employee has given me a terrible time. Some people shouldn’t be working in customer service at all. Definitely singled out by this very rude person who works there for some reason. I know we are social distancing but yelling like a hundred feet away at a customer is not appropriate at all . I’m thinking of calling corporate .<//Text>

This Albertsons is thankfully just walking distance from my place. Being as such, this Albertsons has saved me time and again whenever I’m in need of an ingredient and in need of a quick run to the market. The service here has always been good too. I do wish the market held more organic foods and other ingredients, but other than this, I like this store.< /Review>

<Review>I like it. For the quick grocery trip it works. The staff is friendly and helpful. It was busy, especially for early afternoon. But there were several lanes open and the wait wasn't long. The baskets don't squeak and roll smoothly, which I can't say about other nearby stores. Helps to feel like the store is maintained. Floral selection is ok. And I'd mark down half a star if I could. Outside of that, I'll be back, even if it's a little farther than others.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c32c92756e269d:0xde6b839b0e682b8f<//Gmap_id></record>

Even when I photo the upc on my phone, and enter it on my list, and enter my phone number at checkout, the system frequently charges me a higher price.

<review>Great little market that seems to have just about anything you need and great selection! And the owners are incredibly nice and friendly. This is the kind of place that makes you feel good about shopping non-chain stores. Very good prices. The fruits and veggies have been surprisingly excellent!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Absolutely the worst Albertsons I've ever shopped at.  It's tucked away in a very busy area off of a very very busy street.  It's small so their selection is not great.  And the coup de grâce, their chicken is very poorly packaged so when you pick one up you get funky chicken yuck all over your hands, so you're left trying to wipe your hands on the overhead paper towels, and then hope you have hand sanitizer in your car.  Terrible and completely inexcusable.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>This Albertsons has the best cakes ! Great variety and price. You won't think the cake is from a grocery store.
Very clean and very nice employees.
They also have a wings bar with hot and fresh wings. Lots of flavors. Sold by weight.
They also have fresh made (while you watch ) sushi.< /Review><name>Amanda Jahanvash< /name>< user_id>

Shop here once a week. Excellent customer service and very knowledgeable staff. I've asked about certain items specific to a recipe and they were able to tell me if they carried it or not. Saul is a manager there and he is great! I forget a coupon at home and he honored it! He walks the store looking to see if anyone needs help finding anything. The organic section is where I shop and the displays are always kept nice and clean.</Text>

<review>What a disappointment! So expensive but you NEVER get your $'s worth! Fruit tasteless! Beautiful but tasteless. All for show...nothing is
real quality.
The words "rip-off" come to mind. Return the package time and time again doesn't get it. Are you going to pay for my gas...my time...my disappointment in serving my guest and family
fruit so tough and tasteless?
I paid extra for "pre-cut" but I have to serve it with a fork and knife?  Because humans mouths aren't the size of elephants.
Smart&Final...H Mart and King Market have Albertson's beat...totally!
On my top 10 Worst Market List!
P.S.
And, they can be "uppity" rude!</review>< UserId.>

There are very little choices you can get and they don’t sell jalapeños! The products are ok, but the only thing is that their cashiers are very impolite. There are literally no one in the store< /Review>

She just handed my receipt no smile or thank you, very rude no customer service skills at all.

< Review>
Selling expired food. I bought onion fries for Christmas dinner, when I opened it, the smell was so horrible. I found the expire date was early 2016, they sold it 2 years later! They ruin my party and dinner. Tonight, I went to store after driving 15 minutes. I  was waiting 20 minutes for customer service and nobody care about me, standing there. Then a cashier told me (very rude)  you can get another one or if you want your money back go at the end of line (8 people standing with full carts). I left the expired food there and left the store. This people never learn and worse place to shop. Just see the meat sections, you can see many decayed meat. I am wondering why public health doesn't know about this place. I will notify them, I don't want this grocery store make my family and neighbours sick.<//Review>

<Text>This is the second time I go to the bathroom of this store and it is awful. It smells like urine and the floors are filthy. They have a sign that says if the bathroom is anything but sparkly to let them know, well here it is. Makes me not want to shop with my children.</Text>< Time>

<Text>Usually very friendly staff. I have only really had a bad experience with one.
They keep the place amazingly clean and well stocked. I don't think I have ever seen a bare shelf.
I love the fact they have someone come in everyday and make the sushi. Sushi that wouldn't normally see in a store, definitely restaurant quality.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>This one deserves more than 5 stars in my books.
I went here shopping for flowers and cake a day before my wife's birthday. Although they do not do delivery, the lady store manager offered to deliver the cake and the flowers to my wife the next day herself. What's more, they did not even charge me for the delivery. Needless to say, my wife was delighted to receive her surprise birthday present. I can never thank the store manager enough. It was absolutely wonderful !<//Review></record>

Real hours are from 6am to midnight everyday (I took photos and uploaded here).  Google refuses to update the hours because it shows up as 7am to 11pm on Albertson's website (which is wrong, if Google bothered to call and check, they will tell you they close at midnight every night).  Staff here is friendly and the store is clean.  Good selection of organics.  I usually go to Sprouts now since they have opened but still come here from time to time because of the larger selection.< /review>

<text>Clean place, came to but chicken, the only person available with an Asian lady addendum to the sushi area, I asked her for help, and she wouldn't help me. She said she was busy. So I waited about 5-10 minutes for the people washing dishes to be done. I wouldn't come here for chicken again or catering.<//text>< response>

Generic Albertsons. It's always hard to find basil here, you'll most likely have to buy the actual plant.</review>

When I'm looking for something special the customer there and showed me exactly what I needed and didn't just tell me because of ADHD when I go to some places I asked him for something and tell someone I have a mental impairment they don't direct me to where I need to go but Albertsons takes their time to make sure I find what I need so I'm not walking around the store for 2 hours< /Review>

Pct is usually real good on the service they provide truck drivers today is a different story I've been stuck in his non-moving empty return line for well over an hour now 10 minutes till shift change I will probably get caught up in here during that so I'm wasting a lot of time which is of course money</Text>

<text>The Terminal is organized and I enjoy driving @PCT.

I worked for
*Atlas Marine on Cota Ave. CLOSED.
*Progressive Transportation Services (PTS) Harbor Ave. CLOSED
*Amazon Trucking on Victoria st, CLOSED,  *American Transportation Service Inc, (ATSI ) on PCH CLOSED.

I did not report none of these heroes to anyone, including the IRS. I contemplate an communicate that I have ben set up. They say lets get the competition out of the way bcs all these businesses are CLOSED
Ss's
···> Two days ago a brand new white, with no license plates, Porsche SUV followed me at 3am, I called 911 and LBPD took a report. LBPD says this SUV will be searched for and the driver will be questioned.

This message is to the trucking companies mentioned above I don't give a. F$@#!x who you payed or did not pay.
My name is Chess; I am not in that Mess.

I was employed by these companies and now they are closed. Why only these companies? I have been framed, set up, because somebody does not know how to  lose, antonym of win.

Let me put it like this I do not have any knowledge of the usiness's money profit.

I believe we only have one life, once this life is over there is not another opportunity. We have to educate our children not to believe in crime, murder, guns, drugs. We can change the world only by educating the next generation that will live on earth< /text><username>Herman Grajeda< /username><resp>None</resp><rate>4< /rate>< Gmap_id>

In gate process needs work. Was at the podium long enough to hear the safety message 6 times, both versions, english and spanish. Once inside, went very quickly.<//Text>

< Review>
It's always a very unpleasant experience here these longshoreman that load the containers heads have gotten too big it may take forever and eventually everything's going to go to automated instead of them trying to load the trucks and get us out of here in a timely matter you would think making that much money an hour would make them excited to be at work instead of being rude to the drivers and not trying to get things shipped out faster they're going to get what they got coming to them</Review>

This is just your average Port. Long lines to get in and usually have to wait once inside. The clerk that I spoke to was not friendly and seemed to be in a bad mood. Do need better customer service.</Text>

< Review>
I received excellent service at the Atascadero location. My car was damaged and the insurance company made a reservation for me and they followed up and had a car waiting for me. the entire process was easy and smooth and everyone at the office was very kind and helpful. I would highly recommend this location.< /Review>

Unfortunately this will be the last time I rent from here.
Arrived about 45 min after the pick up time. Was given the only vehicle on the lot . It had not been cleaned,  because I had never had issues with the vehicles at this location, I did not inspect onsite.  The car had dirty foot prints on the back of the seats, filthy trunk with mud stains etc Called 10 min after I left and asked that they clean it. Went back and was given another vehicle (keep in mind no other vehicle was at the lot when I had arrived 10 min prior) again this vehcile had not been cleaned and had a warning that an oil change had to be done. Called was told it was fine no service needed. I cleaned the vehicle bc I didn't have time to go back and get it cleaned.
On my trip, I had to get an oil change for it and spent half a day trying to get it into the shop. Annoyed that I had to clean the vehicle bc the person that helped me couldn't bother to get it done and on top of that spent my vacation getting the vehicle serviced. I rent and pay for a car so I wont have to deal with these things. With COVID it should be a  PRIORITY to have ALL cars cleaned,  sanitized and serviced prior to renting them out.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

My car broke down while out of town. I called the Enterprise Roadside Assistance number. I explained the situation expecting them to send someone to pick me up. Four hours later they sent a tow truck to get their car but told me to have my daughter drive an hour to come pick me up.< /Text>

<text>We needed a car for 2 days while ours was in the shop. John came out to pick me up and took me back 2 days later when I returned the rental. They did not have the size car I had asked for so they gave me a better one at no extra cost. Andy at the front desk, and John were both wonderful!  They were amazing.

I 100% recommend renting a car with Enterprise. I rented a car from the Enterprise in Atascadero and I was worried because I had never rented a car before. The staff was more than helpful and assured me. I was in a car within an hour and on my way with my family.</Review>

Older,  USB, no Bluetooth. It worked out okay in the end. So why five stars because just by mentioning it to the manger in office at the to line of return at Atascadero office I was given 10% off at already great price. I did not mention it with expectations of any price reduction. I just casually mentioned it but they went above and beyond.
They have good staff always quick to pick up and drop off.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>I wanted a bike for health and cruising.  Not sure what I was walking into.  I was overwhelmed and almost ready to walk away. Then Parker stepped into the picture.  I appreciate the patients and time spent with me in making my choice in a first time purchase for a Giant.  Ultimately I left happy with my purchase and will definitely be back for exceptional service such as the service Parker provided.  💯< /review>< Gmap_id>

I went in after getting a recommendation to check out this place from a random independent merchant in Santee Alley.   After knowing what my spending limits for a bicycle were I was able to purchase a beautiful 21 speed Giant Roam bike.  This fit my plans perfectly.  And they even thru in a free kickstand and adjusted it to fit my height.   After riding it around I have had several compliments and jealous remarks from other Road and Mountain bike enthusiasts.   I feel that I got a great deal and made a good decision to enter this store.</Text>

I've had work done on a few bikes here and the mechanic work has been good. Not giving 5 stars for a couple reasons. When ordering an item or getting bike work done, they don't call to let you know your stuff is ready, you gotta call, even tho they say they're gonna call you. Also, got a tune up there and asked for a new crank setup, we agreed on a price and when I picked up my bike they had added a derailleur to make the new setup work. Obv it needed to be done but they didn't call to give me a heads up on the extra part/charge.
The mechanic work done on my bike was good and I'm happy with it, and the workers are always nice and generally helpful. Their customer service/communication is not great, I would say.</text>

Extremely satisfied w my purchases and recommendations from the staff here. First time picking up actual hiking gear, Charles and Natalie did a superb job explaining everything and making us feel like Just Ride family. Highly suggest inquiring on their "CO-OP" membership. Would recommend this location for picking out any camping or hiking gear.  Thanks again guys! Will be back soon for next hiking expedition. - Rob</Review>

<Review>I have been a customer of JRLA for a long time and they never disappoint. The staff are great and friendly. Ask them questions about where to go ride your bicycle and they will tell you where to go to get away from traffic. They have a variety of products for your bicycle and different prices. Their stock on bicycles is very good considering the low inventory in many bike shops now. Follow them in Instagram and send them a DM thru the app, they will respond fast and they don't mind responding to the many questions you could send. Believe me, after reading my history of messages I was annoyed by me and they received me in the store very warmly.
BTW, thank you for your services, I am enjoying the bike I recently got from you.</Review>< pictures>

Great store with fantastic staff. Clearly they love active sports and SB really makes great use of this passion. I wanted to really compliment Isabella (I think I have that right) for excellent product knowledge and ability to get my needs quickly. She gently inquired about my knowledge level and adjusted her spiel to my level of knowledge interest. You can't ask for more.  Happy to spend my money at this fine store. The fact that they are so active in our community is just a big ol' bonus.<//text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I have been eyeing getting a foldable bike for awhile. During Covid, its been hit or miss with stores actually having them in stock. After waiting for a few months, I decided to just do it. I live in the valley but wanted to try Just Just Ride LA due to all the great things Ive heard. I wasn't disappointed. Even though I had my 6yo son with me, sales associate Parker was still very detailed and patient and took time to answer all of my questions and concerns. Id recommend JustRideLA to anyone!! #Dahon< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCD5RUdKFSBl30qFiN-EYh5bn8iIeglS8udh9W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

This one-man operation is awesome!  I just moved to the neighborhood and started biking to work again.  I was having trouble with my gears (over 2 years since my last tune-up) and brought my bike in.  Paul, the Bike Doctor, originally quoted $59, but when he delivered my bike a few days later, the final price was actually $40!  Free pick-up & delivery + a 6-month guarantee is the best deal I've ever had on bike service.< /Text>

<review>UPDATE;
I want to say the staff are nice, but I felt like I got ripped off. I took in my electric  bike for a tune up and I was told it was $90 then they called me to tell me is $120. I said okay when I went back to pick it up, it was making a high pitch sound ( it didn’t have this noise before I took it in) when I press on the brakes, so I took it back and they said my brake pads were worn off and charged me extra $20 to get it replaced. They should’ve told me this in advanced when they did the tune up. The manager Reached out to me to apologize which I really appreciated. He was very attentive and asked about what happened and what he can do to fix it. He listened to my concerns and I thought that was great</review><name>Mayra Payan<//name></record>

<Review>What a great place to get a bike! We honestly weren't thinking we'd walk out with a purchase today. The sales rep Juan(?) was incredibly helpful, showed us how to determine the right frame to fit our height and was able to answer all our questions as first time bicycle owners. We got the Jamis XR and my hubby is excited!< /Review><name>Sandra Villalva< /name>< Pics>

What appears to be a converted grocery store or something, this might be one of the biggest sporting goods store I've ever been to. Considering the sparceness of the area, it's great they were able to use this existing building without completely renovating the exterior.<//text>

<review>Let me just say that... THIS PLACE IS AMAZING !! I was greeted promptly by a well mannered and knowledgeable gentleman named Juan. Absolutely charming guy! The whole staff is excellent! But going back to Juan. I told him what I was looking for (type of bike/price range) and acted with no hesitation to show me what he KNEW I’d want. The wide array of bike options were displayed marvelously! The prices are pretty fair, they offer payment plans on approved credit, as well as a 3 month (max) layaway! Test driving was also an option! There was no rushing of any kind. After purchasing my bike, they filled the tires and inspected it for any issues. Great team that knows what they’re doing and are very careful, not only in handling the bikes, but also handling each customer with the upmost respect and good intent. Highly recommend this shop for any of your bike wants and needs. Keep up the amazing work ladies and gents of Just Ride L.A. !!!<//review><Rating>5</Rating><user_id>115205118230985876698<//user_id>< Pics>

My husband had custom ordered a Brompton bike that was set to be delivered to the store. Juan was so incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about everything. We ended up getting myself a bike, as well as a trailer for our kids, and a bike rack for the car. Juan and the team showed us how to properly install and use all of the features on our items and were incredibly patient with us while we had two energetic toddlers run throughout the store. We definitely recommend this store, and especially Juan, who will answer every question you may have.< /review>

However they have integrity issues, they don’t take responsibility when a mistake is made, and to guarantee your business they will quote a price and time frame of completion with no intention in honoring it, there words are useless... They definitely left a bad tase in my mouth.  THUMBS DOWN!!!!!!!!!</Review>< Resp>

Juan and his team are fantastic. I was in a pinch and they went above and beyond to fix my bikes to make sure I had everything I needed. I walked in with a part for my trainer that wouldn't fit my bike. He knew the problem right away and said I could come back if I needed help fitting to to my bike. I came back with both of my bikes and they set everything up for me!! I was able to order everything else I needed and they made sure that it would fit my bikes. They are a wealth of knowledge that I would have never known if I bought online. A great gem that I'll continue to go back to.</text>

Great shop for purchasing a bike. Juan was very attentive helping me choose the perfect bike. Unlike other shops who take advantage of their first time buyers on purchasing a bike, Just Ride LA guided me to the proper bike for my needs.

The service was great! Juan and the staff were amazing! Waited for me, explained everything, helped me more than I could asked.
The shop is big, got all kind of bikes and spacial electric vehicles (electric skateboards, onewheel etc)
Lot's of accessories.

I took my bike to have a rear oil brake fixed, but Juan explained to me that my bike needed a full service.  I accepted his comment only that I asked him to please keep all the parts that would be changed to my bike. Juan told me that it was good that I returned in a week because they did not have the same parts that my bike occupies.  I came back in the week he told me and my bike was not ready yet.  My bike was held for almost 4 weeks, apart from spending almost $ 1,300 dollars, my bike was in poor condition.  # 1 my wheels had tubless fluid and I asked them to change the tires and put new fluid on it and juan said that my wheels were bad that they couldn't put fluid on it.  # 2 the rear brake was fixed but the front one started with the same problem, christian the mechanic told me that juan knew what was going to happen and said nothing, juan wanted me to invest more money in my bike when he had not been able to fix it.  # 3 I never received my old parts that I asked to be saved.  Conclusion I do not think it is the right place to take bikes to fix them, maybe they have very nice new bikes but the service is not good.  Now my bike is unable to use because the brake does not work and I do not know who to trust to fix my bike.< /text>

<text>They asked me for a flat fee of $35 to true one wheel, without taking a very close look. That seems very high -- I think bike shops normally quote 15~20, and 25 at the highest.

Edit: I went to another reputable bike shop and got the job done for $15. If you want to get reasonable rates, *shop around*. This place takes one look at you and your bike, sizes you up, and "gambles" i.e. tries a high quote on you because you look like you'll pay for it on the spot. This is the worst type of repair shop, whether it's an auto repair shop or a bike shop. I remember that while I was hesitating because $35 seemed high, one of the technicians suggested buying a new wheel ("Another option is to buy a new wheel, like this one here (points to a completely different type of second-hand wheel hanging from the ceiling) it's not going to be the same color, but it'll definitely be safe". Why would I buy a new wheel?<//text>< Rating>

I came into the shop last month looking for a solid bike for daily commute. This is a family run business, and the brothers were super helpful right from the start. They helped me decide which bike was best, and as someone relatively new to biking, they gave me great advice. My whole experience was awesome, we even took a picture for Instagram before my brother and I left! I'll be heading back into the shop for the free first-month bike tune-up they offer, and I'm really looking forward to it.< /Text>

Just Ride L.A. dialed my body measurements onto both road bike and track bike with awesome bike fit service. Super easy process, the guy was cool and is certified on bike-fitting. From that, I gained strength, speed, & feel comfortable enough to ride for long distances without discomforts like neck pain, over- extending reach on handlebars, or my butt feeling numb LOL. Another amazing quality service is the tune-up leaving your bicycle factory clean  Seriously, this shop will accommodate you & especially know how to treat your bike! Thanks JRLA staff!< /Text>

Customer service was outstanding. The salesman didn't talk down to me and didnt try to up sell me. He also gave great tips and advise on local rides. I just started riding again and was concerned about going to a bike shop. A few more miles under my belt and I'll be going back for some new wheels.</review>

<text>Bikes, Boards, Scooters, and MORE!

I came here to buy my OneWheel XR. They were able to show me E-Bikes and Electric Boards. Not only did they have everything I wanted to see... they had more. I was able to spec out an electric kit for my existing bike, save money, and I bought the OneWheel I came in looking for! OneWheel Accessories? Yup. They have them and can order whatever they don't stock.

Employee (Danny) didn’t want to give me a refund after two days of buying a item. Despite the item still being brand new and having a reciept. I called the store all he said was I got a incoming call so bye and I can’t do anything about it “bro” so unprofessional. He didn’t want to give me a refund because I didn’t have the piece of cardboard that he threw away once I bought the item.<//text>

This bike shop is amazing.  I can't say enough good things about how much Christian took care of me and my bike!  Christian really took his time with me and gave me great advice. I could tell he truly cared about my safety and happiness. My new electric bike was shipped to a bike store in Santa Monica for assembly and after just two rides the fenders were loose and falling, the attached light had come off, and the brakes weren't quite right. They did a great job at Just Ride LA getting me going again and I got a great basket there, too. I am so glad I found this place and the cool people who work there.  Christian, Danny and Ezekial were just the best. Everybody working there contributed to a really good experience. I highly recommend this shop! Cool peeps that take great care of you! :)</review>

<Review>This was my second visit here. Last time, I bought my bike, pedals, lights, shoes, etc., and this time some new tires. The guys at Just Ride are fantastic. They are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. They really take their time to make sure you get the best possible service and ensure you are happy with your purchase. I've been to several other bike shops and none of them genuinely compare to Just Ride in terms of service quality.

I like my bike and the rest of the gear (lights, lock and helmet) that I got at Just Ride, but it was like pulling teeth to get the sales person to talk to me about the accessories while my bike was being set up by the mechanic.

The stock of large frames was very lacking for me and my partner had an even harder time trying to find a small frame during the same visit.

A couple weeks after getting said bike, my shifters stopped working. I managed to get my chain back on and get to work as a fixie. When I took the bike into a different shop closer to my office on my way home, they told me the issue was because the shifter had been installed waaaaaaay too high on the frame; after getting that addressed (and several other minor adjustments which probably would have been covered in the "free adjustments" offered by Just Ride), the bike has ridden much more smoothly.< /Text>

< review>
I took in a 15-year old bike that was given to me that was basically put together with various parts over the years.  I only use my bike 3-4 times a week for very short trips, but I wanted to make it ride better.  Daniel (the owner) listened to my needs, fine-turned the bike and replaced a chain. For $50.00 it rides like new.  I was so impressed I sent my nephew there and he bought a new bike and loves it.  They have bikes in all price ranges for every level of cyclist.  I've been back to buy a bike lock, basket and other accessories.  Everyone in the store is friendly and knowledgeable.  I can't imagine going anywhere else.</review>

The staff at Just Ride LA are fantastic. They were the most helpful, understanding and reasonably-priced bike shop to disassemble two bikes for shipping across the country (my partner and I called at least five other bike shops in the area). The staff handled our time-sensitive request on the same day, printed out our shipping labels for us and let us leave our boxes for FedEx to pick them up from the shop. They even gave us free cold water bottles! We could enjoy our stay in LA and know that our bikes were in good hands. Thanks, Just Ride LA!<//Text>

Welcome to your local neighborhood bike shop. They will take care of you. I have very specific bicycle needs. They were able to meet all of them and they are really cool people by the way. Just moved to LA and I'm happy to have met Parker and Danny. This is where you should go to get your bike fixed.< /Text>

Since getting my first bike from Just Ride LA, I have become a regular customer. They always provide great service and are patient/willing to help find the perfect bike for you. I've upgraded my bicycle 3 different times with them already and always go back for tune ups/if I need any parts. The staff here is very knowledgeable and I trust my bike with no one else. They have also started doing bike fits, an amazing and unique service that really makes you feel like you are one with your bicycle. I don't understand the negative reviews/complaints because I have never had any issues with the team/service here and cannot recommend this shop enough.</review>

This place may have good service may have good products I don't know and I won't know because, when I walked in I was told to leave my bike outside on one of the racks.
I just don't see how a pet store would be successful if it made you leave your dog outside. It's a shame because I'm in the market for a bike and I was looking to drive between 12 and 1800 bucks, at this particular location. DTLA bijes here i come.< /review>

I just bought a beautiful used hybrid bike from Just Ride LA yesterday. Danny was accommodating of my student status on a budget and gave me a sweet deal on the bike and a sturdy U-lock. They opened the U-lock package and let me know of all the additional parts and mounted it onto the bike. I really recommend this place for good service and a variety of selections.< /review>

Hi Just Ride Team,

I bought my Evolve GTX Bamboo 4/30 to one of your branch store “Just Ride” in LA on their stocks (not special order). But after I bought it the same day I heard the new Evolve Series is coming. So I tried not to open the box and planned to return.  So I went back to return the board on the 3rd Day after buying it. I was very surprised when the manager told me that I could not return the board. I said I just bought this 3 days ago and never open, but the guy manager still insisted no returns.

After this, I started reading the return policy, and it said I can return the product within 14 days of purchase, with sales receipt, with unopened box, and if opened they will charge 25% stock fee. I said this never been opened and way less than 14 days, but they still refused to accept my return and they told me that if I want to return the board, they will charge me 25%. So I was really surprise and I called the other manager. I kindly explained, and he said he will get back to me. Later, he said the same thing but he had another option, saying that I can return the Evolve GTX but I will not get my money back. Instead, they will give me store credit for me, saying I can get the new one once it is released then they can order it for me.

I thought that it was maybe a good option, although I have never done it before and I was not comfortable doing that, so I decided not to accept it. I still believed that they should accept my return, so I waited a little longer and maybe they will change their mind and come back to me. They came back and said that maybe I can try the Evolve manufacturer.

Personally, I don’t think you, Evolve, will accept the return. I did not buy it directly from you guys, so why would you accept the return? Maybe you will accept the repair warranty, but not the sales return. I told them my reasoning and thought but the manager told me to try.

I left the store and told them in a calm and professional manner that I will never buy any of their stuff ever again and I promised them I will give them a very good review. So I left after I said that without any response from them.

I just bought a beautiful used hybrid bike from Just Ride LA yesterday. Danny was accommodating of my student status on a budget and gave me a sweet deal on the bike and a sturdy U-lock. They opened the U-lock package and let me know of all the additional parts and mounted it onto the bike. I really recommend this place for good service and a variety of selections.</Text>

Been thinking about a Brompton for a few years, but never really felt the need to pull the trigger until biking to work became a reality.

After calling the shop twice and visiting twice, I quickly realized this was the perfect place for all your bike needs. Staff is great, ready to help and willing to answer questions patiently, which was a huge deal for me on the fact that this needed to be a carefully thought out purchase (special shoutouts to Juan and Danny!). Not only did they answer my questions, but Juan was great at making sure all my needs were addressed from picking the right Brompton, to the payment process, and aftercare procedures. He was very clear on payment options and checking to make sure my plan was right for me. I never felt pressured at the shop to buy anything, which is awesome. It was also nice to be able to test ride the bikes.

I bought a bike for life and I'm glad I did it here! Looking forward to bringing my bike here in the future for upkeep and other goodies.<//text>

Super expensive, and having 3 20"bmx bikes and a set of 20" rims does not qualify you as a bmx Retailer. Come on guys you guus are all about road bikes, why say you sale bmx? Keep it 100% don't fake the funk< /text>

Just Ride La is a great place to buy a bike but i would not recommend buying parts for a bike unless any other shop doesn't have them. Just Ride La's parts are heavily overpriced and they have a huge labor charge. For example i bought some new bar tape for $12 but they charged a $20 fee to put it on. So i decided to go to another local shop and they did it for $3 with is about 6x less than Just Ride.< /Review>

<text>This place sucks. They just care about making $$$ and dont care about helping you out with your bike. I went in the other day to buy a few upgrades for my bike. I took my bike with me so i could make sure the items fit. When i went inside the store i was told to leave my bike outside the shop! Really? I thought this was a bike shop!!!  I really wanted a bike seat so i left my bike outside and went inside to purchase a seat i asked if they would install it for me since i had the bike with me and they had all the tools i thought its just a bike seat should be easy. Nope that was extra $$$$$ to install the seat! The bike seat was $60 and they wanted more money?? Total dissapointment.</text><gmapID>0x80c2c7c5795adafd:0x21749527b7a4f423</gmapID>< user_id>

<review>I cannot recommend the bike fitting that Just Ride LA provides enough. Before I came to get my bike fit at JRLA, I had gone through 3 different (and very expensive) saddles and still had no relief from lower back, knee, and groin pain (even top of the line chamois' were not helping). Everything changed when Chris fitted me. His fitting was meticulous: it included a preliminary questionnaire where he asked me everything from how I would like to ride to body measurements, refitting my clips and getting new insoles for my shoes, and the best was finally getting a saddle that actually fit and felt comfortable to sit on (turns out I prefer power saddles)! In total, the fitting lasted for two hours, but now I can ride with complete comfort and no pain. I have never had a fitting as good as this. Trust me when I say this: this fitting is WORTH EVERY PENNY!<//review>< pics>

< Review>
Used to come here all the time but had a flat tire from my ride home from work. Bought my tube and didn't have my tools on me. Asked to used theirs to put my tube on they said no. So I asked if they could put it on and they wanted the same amount of money the tube costed. I offered them all the money I had left on me which was half of what they where asking to put the tube on and said no. This was right before closing time so their were no other shops open. Not even an auto shop was open where I'm sure they would have let me use a wrench. Awful experience. I've bought bikes here and lots of parts. Always use their free air when I'm in the area, but that's the last time I go to this shop. Guy that was running the bike repairs was totally stuck up like he got off in the fact that I'd have to walk my bike home. Is this what the bike community has come to? SMH< /Review>

<text>Excellent service, excellent variety, very competitive. Spoke with owner for awhile, they have been open about 8 months, he use to sell parts and now runs this shop. I don't personally know how well the store is doin, but it was very busy the two days I went in and with higher gas prices and summer coming, I assume it is very good.<//text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2c7c5795adafd:0x21749527b7a4f423<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The bike fit I received at JRLA changed my cycling experience.  I had been riding for about two years on my bike and had received a bike fit previously.  Even with the prior fitting, I was still experiencing pain and discomfort.  JRLA took the time to talk to me about what kind of cycling I was doing, offer me the best prices for new equipment for my bike, and took the time to explain to me why and how everything that they were doing.</Text>

Walked in with a hybrid commuter that had been siting out side for a while and i told the guy i just wanted to get it running again. He said that i basically need to spend about 250 to set it all up again. He was just trying to sell me even new cables and chain when the ones that are on work. Ended up buying a rim that was clearly destroyed and some grips and it cost me 80 dollars with 20 worth of labor. definitely got RIPPED OFF! then i ask them to pull the cables on the back brake a bit just to make it more responsive and i get a " ohh no, that going to cost you more" all he had to do is adjust the cable a bit. That was the least they could do after i spend 80 bucks in 5 min. Really bad customer service.... ever.... NEVER GOING BACK THERE!<//Text>

<text>these guys are A-1 with service. I bought a Cinelli from Just Ride LA in 2012 and just recently the frame cracked in the welding. the warranty from the manufacturer for the frame was 2 years pass expiration and Just Ride still went to work to secure me a replacement frame. In the end I got my frame replaced with a new 2016. there was no worry or hassle and no cost beyond the rebuild ......these guys will really work with you.....thank you Just Ride LA.

Very nice people, but I keep going here to buy things - tubes, peddles, lights, tune-ups, etc. and everything breaks within a week.
I keep going back cause they are so close to where I live, but I keep getting into trouble cause I always have problems with their cheap products.  I even buy the more expensive stuff just to make sure I won't have any problems and still I always suffer in the end.
So many woes during so many times riding.  Be good to yourself and find some place else.</text>

First of all I just wanted to say that this is the only place I recommend to my friends around here.  A year ago my girlfriend got her bike here and they were so helpful and nice.  We've been back multiple times since because we love their service and our experience there!  We've had other bicycles fixed, bought necessary and unnnecessary but fun products(that are never cheap and still haven't broken after a year...and we bought the cheap stuff), and just returned this past week to look at bicycles we're planning on buying since my girlfriend's was just stolen.

Thank you to everyone that works here for being so helpful and knowledgeable!  Will definitely keep recommending Just Bike LA and remain a loyal customer< /Text><pics>None<//pics><user_name>Layne Bloom<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

Ripoff. A friend of mines had a tire puncture and needed to replace the innertube, and they wanted to charge her $10! For a standard schrader inner tube that would cost 3 or 4$ plus another dollar for installation! No variety, i swear. If i wanted to throw money around, id do it at one of the fine end shops in hollywood. At least THEY have excellent parts...</Text>

<time>1610637454877<//time><rate>4<//rate><Review>They just opened rally by wienersnitzetchels on waterman in San Bernardino.  I was so pleased that it was a walk up like the hot dog spot by it. It got one star because they didn't let me sit down like hot dog place by it. Its silly they have seats that are spaced out too. The food was good in which I had a chicken sandwich and fries with a strawberry ice cream cone and lemonade as well as funnel cake fries which were so good. They lack on their condiments in which I had to go home to enjoy their food fully. The ice cream cone was a nice whip and very flavorful.< /Review>< pictures>

It's about time we got another Rally's in the area. This one is not the best but hopefully in time it will get better the Food is good but the customer service needs some improvement. And so do the chilli cheese fries  they taste like the ones from 7 eleven</text>

Oh don't get me started by Rally's man that spot old man that spot they have the most amazing fries and their hamburgers are up to par and well the phone drinks are just fountain drinks so don't expect nothing just spectacular about their drinks cuz they're just like McDonald's and Jack in the boxes and everybody else's but the fries and the burgers are the best that I've tasted in a while and again the customer service on a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 100 they are just wow that's really all I can say<//text>

I reluctantly gave 3 stars, here's why.. the drive thru turn.. who designed that? I drive a sports car and had to back up twice to make the turn. I ordered 3 spicy chicken sandwiches.  I thought it was just me, till someone else said what I thought. Did they cook those with floor cleaner? That was the worst! The good of my experience, as long as the line was, it kept moving pretty quickly. The employees were accurate and friendly. Needless to say, as excited I was to go there for a first time, I was pretty disappointed.
I do want to try a few other items you have on your menu. I am still keeping a open mind, I'm sure I'll have a better experience next time.</Text>

Cashier was very pleasant and nice. Food was amazing. It was exactly what you expect when looking at the menu. I hate seeing pictures of burgers then getting something that does not look the same. Decent price for a good burger. Fries taste like they are actually made from fries! Love it.</Text>

My first time to rally's in rialto and not going to lie the burger was terrible i threw it out the window didn't even want to go back to change for anything will probably never go back to rally's again ill stick to the other burger places but the loaded fries were ok the order was done as quick as I pulled up so I guess the burger was done or re cooked even small business will give you a fresh flame grilled burger im just saying not good at all just to be opened up in this new location please send someone from corporate to fix this place or move out...just saying straight from my heart ❤<//Text>

I wanted to give this place a zero to be honest. I walked in today 5/5/2020 a little after 3:30pm to get something to eat. I understand with everything that is going on places are closed but you would have people come inside for an interview than let a hungry truck driver buy some food. Thank you for all you do and the way that you treat the people that bring the materials that you need to sell to make money.< /Review>

Fries were good and the burger was good. Unfortunately always double check your food. We noticed we were missing a drink and a sunday and thought that was it. Unfortunately we noticed we were missing more fries from our meals once we got home. Service was pretty quick for a packed drive through and the employees were nice. Just double check your food to make sure you have everything.< /text>< pics>

Very rude staff. Ordered a big Buford burger and requested no ketchup or mustard. Once I got home 15 mins later I noticed my burger had mustard. Drove back and politely requested a refund since at that point I had lost my appetite. I understand mistakes happen but I can't stand when staff is rude acting like its the customer's fault for a mistake they made. For the inconvenience I asked the manager Erica is she could refund my total $24.50 or at least my combo that had the mistake and she said no that only the burger could be refunded. I ended getting around $4 back. Not even the drive of 2 trips, the long wait in line, and the horrible service provided. Will definitely not be back. And as someone who has worked in the fast food industry, I highly recommend everyone be retrained because both times that I have gone I was provided with terrible service. If you don't want to work, I'm sure someone will feel blessed to have a job you take for granted.<//Text>

< Review>
Um going 2 keep this polite as possible ive worked n the food services for fast food i understand but when u have only one car (remember i said one car) so it should be no excuses for how you mess up the order more three times. It was only three people in the car how do you mess up this order five different times honestly everyone that was working at (1:36pm on 8/5/2020 needs to be fired) i have been a rally's lover since i was a kid back in 97 in long beach im very upset & will never return (no stars)</Review>

Amazing place, our dinner was splendid from start to finish. Was greeted promptly. The power outage citywide caused the dinner to be bit warmer than expected, but that's definitely not their fault. Over great experience, will come back.< /text>

<Review>Couldn’t wait to go here. Once we arrived it was horrible customer service! People before us where upset because their order wasn’t ready. We received all our food expect one item. Had to wait until we left just to get our food. Other customers where upset over the service. one customer started to yell to give everybody their money back. The supervisor was unruly with the customer and refused to give the money back to us and other customers. Experience was horrible! Highly disappointed! This establishment won’t be open very much longer if they continue to give slow service and bad customer service.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1573397647615, 'text': "Hi, this should never be the impression we leave.

Ordered a Fry Lover's Burger without buns. The fries were cold and the cheese wasn't melted! Also the customer service was bad and I was the only car in line! Compared to the other Rally's I've been to, this by far is the worst one. I would be disappointed to see this Rallys leave Rialto do to poor customer service.< /text>

<Review>They were super drive through focused... Meanwhile I'm waiting in the lobby 10 minutes and when I ask about the order the guy working the table(making the sandwiches) says he hasn't even started. So I had to ask for a refund....

<Text>Decided to try Rally’s again, and wow.
Last time I was here, service was slow. Food was good, but the drive thru was extremely busy. Too long of a line too wait.
My family and I decided to go inside. Even with going inside the service was slow.
This time drive thru moved extremely fast. Food tasted even better than last time. Not sure if management has changed, but shout out to the major improvements made!!! Cashier and GM were very friendly. I will be filling out the survey on the back of the receipt and be coming back! Consider me sold! 🙏🏻<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Took 20 min. to get my order.
Went back 1-14-2020, service was even worse. Ordered chicken wings and sticks 35 min. wait.
So much for lunch break.
Tried Raley's Web site (unsecured (hacker heaven) site).
Like the food, service really sucks.<//text>< pics>

<review>It was an okay experience, the inside is a bit chaotic and busy, the chicken sandwiches they have tasted a bit better than McDonald's and the Fry lover fries were served in a medium cup.

The tables and chairs were a bit dirty while I was there and you'll probably will have to ask someone to clean them.

I probably would come back probably just only for the Fries as they are well seasoned.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1573412838405, 'text': "Hi there, we hate to let down a fan.

I never knew Rallys was a nationwide chain. This gave me memories of the time I spend my summer with my relatives in the San Diego County town of Ramona back in 2001. The one in Ramona is no longer there, but there is one in Escondido. Who knew, I would eat at Rallys again a few decades later. This Rallys opened not too long ago. This one is a full restaurant with drive thru, the one in Ramona and Escondido is a drive thru with a few outdoor picnic tables.

I ordered a Big Bufford. Its was pretty good. It had a little bit of In N Out flavor, but its own thing. The one I ate in Ramona was the regular hamburger which had a sesame seed bun. The fries tasted like seasoned curly fries. My sister ate a Spicy Chicken sandwich, which I will try next time.

4 Stars.< /text>

Overall the food was good, decent variety and taste. Prices are reasonable, the inside was pretty simplistic. The dining area could be expanded as in a more open floor plan, more tables because I could see it getting crowded during busy times. The taste of the food, the service, and the prices is what I can see bringing people back.< /Review>

It was real good! My family and I were the only ones inside to eat. The staff was super nice and courteous. Went on Wednesday which we thought was gunna be packed but it wasn't. Food took 10 minutes which is cool because you don't wait long. Yeah it is next to the train tracks but at least it's getting exposure for others to see there's one closer than driving all the way to L.A. Rialto is really coming along with it's fast food food places and restaurants. Thanks for the meal Rally staff 👍< /text>

The food is great! But the customer service definitely needs to be improved that lady manager is very rude I was in the Drive-Thru and had asked for 4 cups of ice and mind you I had a large order but when she saw me pouring the ice in a bigger cup she said she could only give me two and then shut the window on me.< /text>

This place is w.e compared to others, and they got FALSE ADVERTISEMENTS  say upgrade to any size at 0 cost.. is a lie they charge.
But there's a sing on the Menu that's says it.
The manager is hella rude when you approach  about  it.   Cant wait for the new checkers down the st. On Foothill  ave.< /review>

< Review>
🔥👌 customer service on point, even though they had credit card issue. She let me know. The food was soooo bomb! I got the hot wings, mozzarella sticks, baconzilla and no it doesn't taste like no damn mc Donald's. Oh and they fasho got the best fries ever! The burgers don't have that weird flavor that Wendy's has either. Patties were not flat like a lot of these burger place.</Review>

<text>So happy you're here in Rialto if it wasn't for my son who works for BRC and did the install I wouldn't have known it was here in Rialto. My food was delicious and taste exactly like the one in L.A.. My only suggestion is that they clean the windows. Welcome  to Rialto Rally's< /text>< rating>

<text>I was looking forward to this place, was very excited about going to Rally's,  but it was truly a disappointment , they were missing a lot of items including ice, can you imagine having a drink without ice?but yet they charged you the same price, not good at all. I'm not going back to this place,  absolutely not like the one in Glendale Ca.</text>< name>

<review>I’ve been to Dime twice and it will definitely be my go to nail place now. The staff is so nice, the space is lovely, the vibe is super cool, and my nails have looked great each time I’ve been there. My first gel manicure from here lasted a full two weeks with minimal chips – even with me traveling a bunch, dealing with a heavy carry on bag, and not taking great care to keep them up. I’m so impressed with the people and service here!</review>< Pics>

Also- immediately when walking in the customer service is amazing. Wine (Rose, Pinot Grigio or Prosecco) and water (still or sparking) was offered to me right away. Everyone here takes great care to make sure you have a great experience! JuJu is awesome and precise, if you want to request someone!<//Text><name>Megen Sterba</name>< gmap_id>

My appointment for a gel manicure was at 12pm, so I came a little early and once I came 20 minutes before my appointment time they immediately got started. Jessi and Selene ( I think that’s how you spell there names) were very detail-oriented with my gel manicure and pedicure. They were very nice and the whole vibe of the place is pretty cool itself.

I loved my experience here!! The two ladies were super sweet to my friends and I and made sure we were comfortable. They were very enthusiastic about their job unlike many other nail salons I've been too. Pedicure was $25 & well worth it! The massage chairs are to die for. Definitely coming back here.</Review>

I hesitated on whether i had enough time for a pedicure but it was definitely worth it, i loved the jelly bath and the foot rub and my feet feel so smooth. I can't wait to try the lavender spa pedicure next time I'm there. Definitely recommend.<//text><user>113311630414556850605< /user>< pics>

Ken and Molly did a great job on my refill! They only do dip powder here for tips! Ken was so fast and very into details when he was filing my nails! The shape is perfect and Molly did a really good paint job and again really into details and made sure my nails came out great!!!</review>

The salon is very clean and professional. The owner is very detail orientented and has designed the salon to be a relaxing experience for the client. My gel manicure looks impeccable. She took her time and made my nails look beautiful. My only complaint is that I spent more than I wanted to. A design is $4/nail, regardless of the complexity of the design. I wanted a very simple pattern, and ended up spending $73 (including tip) for a gel manicure. Other than that, it was a great experience!<//text>

<Time>1566585392052</Time><rate>5</rate><Text>I first came across Dime Nails on Instagram. I love the bold, fun designs they make and their account looked really cool. I've been several times and I love it! It's super clean and the furniture is comfy. I've sat with different nail techs each time but each was pleasant and well skilled. The first time I came, I had nails that were damaged from acrylics done at another salon. Instead of just taking my money, Pei told me my nails needed a break and gave me a regular mani instead. Now my nails are strong and healthy again. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for high quality work and a nice place to relax!</Text>< Pics>

I just had a "sugaring" wax. It is all natural and less painful (but Neva always makes waxing less painful than I have ever had before) and makes everything nice and smooth. Try it!!</Review>

< Review>
It was was my privilege to receive my very first manicure and pedicure at Dime Nails LA! I was extremely impressed from beginning to end. The decor is stellar, the music selection is dope, and the entire staff is nice and extremely hospitable. Even though I arrived 10 minutes late, they were very flexible with my accommodations. They offered me a delicious mimosa, and I received the manicure and pedicure simultaneously. Pei did wonders on my hands and so did my pedicurist. I was very pleased. After my service, the owner Kristin, made sure that I had a pleasant experience as well. Kudos Dime Nails! I couldn't imagine having my first mani/pedi experience anywhere else :-)</Review>

Ami the manager was so sweet and very efficient with making my appt and when I got there was on top of it.  Sparkling rose--heyyy! My Ladies Selena and Pei Lee were really good and nice too. My nails and toes were a hot mess and they whipped them into shape. Good selection of nails polishes, really cool vibe and I love the design of the place (apparently the owner was a fan of Prince). Check it out!!</review>

Really loved my mani pedi! The gel mani price is on the higher side of average for LA but my nail shape was flawless and it lasted for 4 weeks. My only complaint is that the manicurist did push my thumb cuticle back too far and it bled, but honestly everything else was so good that I’m still going back.

I also love that they’re open late, perfect for those of us that want to pop in after work!<//text>

<Text>I’m really in love with this place. My nails are my indulgence so I’ve been to a ton of salons, and Dime checks all the boxes. Clean, nail techs on point, sweet staff, real vibes (none of that trendy for the sake of Instagram nonsense), and priced right.< /Text>< Pics>

Without really saying too much, lets just say that I never want to go back to regular waxing.  Sugar wax "is where it's at" and Neva's is the place to have it done!< /Review>

I had a mani/pedi at this new nail salon and the experience was 5-star! From the interior design, the amazing staff and supreme mani/pedi packages you can tell they care and have created something LA needs!!

Just what I needed to have some me time and treat myself! Can’t thank you enough, Dime! I’ll be back soon!</text>

<Text>Went through their reviews online seemed like a good place boy was I happy I stopped here price was cheaper than I was quoted at another place, they had to take rear tint off redo rear, front window and brow, they did all that less than two hours showed up first thing in the morning though, very professional  And their life time guarantee can’t beat that anyone looking for tint check this place out!!< /Text><Date>1597522179520<//Date></record>

Got my car in right away and immediately started working on it once I let them know what I wanted for tint percentage. The price is great especially with a warranty and quick work. Took a little under 2 hours for 5 windows so the wait isnt to bad. I was recommend this place by a friend and once I seen his tint & heard the price I was sold. I will also be recommending this place to anyone I know.  With service like this it will be hard for other shops to compete.. Great job guys !!</text>

I've now taken two vehicles to get tinted by Rene and they never let me down. The quality is worth the price & it's the best shop around to give you the best quality for the best price.</Text>< Pics>

I tinted my windows from a different shop and it turned out alright. I had the front removed but decided to go to a different shop to retint my front windows and he did a much better job for a cheaper price. Saved me a little money for better quality. Definitely would recommend this place.<//review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>My wife and I both relocated from Ohio to Cali. Once we arrived we knew right away that our cars both needed to be tinted to keep the temperature down inside the car. Also the glare from headlights needed to be cut down as well. We did a quick Google search and found King Window Tint. Can't say enough about how professional they were and the quality of their work. If I could give 10 stars I would.< /Text>< pictures>

I tried paying at the pump, and it wouldn't work so I swiped my card twice before I had to go inside and swipe again. I have a funny feeling that I'm gonna have to check my card transactions carefully. So be aware of the card readers.<//review>

We needed gas. Arco had the gas we needed. We pumped gas. Arco charged us for gas. We paid for gas. Arco attendant smiled as if he had gas. We did have gas, so we left; with our gas.<//text>

I LOVE this business! It is always clean and everyone there is very friendly and helpful! I usually go for a massage for my lower back pain;  Felipe is awesome! Dr. Cooper is a knowledgeable and kind professional chiropractor who is always available in a timely manner. I live nearby and she and her staff always wave and say hello (from a safe distance). I really enjoy them!</review>

I'm happy to say Dr Cooper & her staff are the absolute best chiropractic team I've ever had the pleasure to deal with. Everyone is happy to help you any way they can and the atmosphere of the office is as positive as you can get. They really know what they're doing and they work together well to give you the best treatment possible. I'm feeling much better since my treatments at Healthsource with Dr Cooper and all her staff. I highly recommend them to anyone who needs Chiropractic or Physical Therapy. They are amazing... You'll love them!</Text>< rating>

<text>I've been going to HealthSource of Anaheim for about a week and I can already feel the difference on my lower back! The pain has finally subsided. Thanks to Dr. Cooper's help and the knowledgeable staff, I am able to move pain-free. They have taught me how to stretch properly which is something I really needed to work on. The massages are my favorite. I have gone to several chiropractors and this one is by far the best one.</text>< resp>

Everyone at this place is very knowledgeable, as i would expect. Dr Cooper of course will quiz you on important information she shares with you (:
Today, Felipe helped me go through some physical therapy stretches and he accurately  targeted the area that I am having issues with (yay!)
I've had massages from Angel and he's awesome at it.

I recommend this place. I have seen other chiropractors and at this location they genuinely care about the patient and his or her personal needs.<//text>

<review>Oh my God you got to check this place out. These people are so nice and kind and so helpful. You won't get better service anywhere else I'm telling you. Dr Cooper and her staff are just genuinely nice loving people and they know that you are in pain and they're doing everything they can to make you feel better. You should not live in pain anymore. I'm telling you, I was so scared when I first went in. I never wanted to visit a chiropractor because I was so scared but Dr Cooper is so helpful and so confident and cares a lot. She really makes you feel comfortable.<//review>< Pics>

I have had the pleasure of knowing Dr Cooper for over 11 years ! I met her when she brought her son to my school . He was a great kid and the family was a pleasure to have ! Ever since then she has always taken care of my back sir I have scoliosis . Brenda is a light of sun when you come in and always greets you when you come in . Felipe is great with the massages and also has a great personality! The rest of the Health Source family are great always with a smile .
I have and always will recommend Dr Cooper to my friends and family . They do “Got your Back “!< /Review>

It's difficult to find high quality health care providers that you adore, would drive any distance to see, know they will have a positive impact on your health, and have great bedside manners. Dr. Cooper and her staff without a doubt fall into this rare category. They certainly are incredible. A large variety of services are offered to help you feel your very best. They work wonders with any insurance coverage you may have. I truly cannot recommend a better Chiropractor in the area.<//Text>

Dr Cooper and staff are awesome! Everyone's friendly and makes you feel welcome. They really care about your well being. I've been to many doctors for my neck and back pain with a "no pain no gain" attitude. Not here, they're considerate and gentle...asks how your doing. They answer my questions and give tips on how to do the at home exercises. My wife and son see Dr Cooper too! I recommend Dr Cooper for your aches and pain.<//Review>

Looking for the best chiropractic office in Orange County? I highly recommend Dr. Cooper's office. Dr. Cooper and her staff are very attentive and thorough, they take time to explain things in a way that I can understand the treatment. The staff is taking care of all my needs and concerns while delivering high-quality service and providing exemplary customer service. Dr. Cooper, Zoe, Felipe, and Brenda are very friendly, professional, and make you feel very comfortable and welcomed, you will feel like family. This office truly amazing-- you won't regret it!!!< /Review>

<Review>This place has the most friendliest staff
They have brenda that mans the front desk and she makes sure that all patient's are greeted and informed of anything they need to know. Then in the back there is Felipe and Andrew that will do your massage and therapy  and likes to kid around with you and make you laugh. Then there is Jodie she does your therapy and is always friendly. Dr
Cooper she handles all your adjustments and listens to any complaints you have about your health and she will tell you what needs to be done outside of her office.<//Review><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

Dr Cooper is a very unique  chiropractors! She definitely has a gift! As a client I walked in feeling pain and now I'm walking out feeling pain free! Zoey the massage therapist has a sense of gratitude and enjoys helping people feel better, it shows how thorough she is as she's massaging and bring very communicative. Brenda the receptionist is very attentive and makes you feel welcome when you walk in the lobby. It's chiropractors, therapist and  places like this I really do help people make it to feel better and make a difference! I am feeling very pain free and grateful at the moment thank you.<//text>

<Review>After my husband’s wonderful experience with Dr. Cooper, I finally decided to give Healthsource a try. I don’t have back pain, but back stiffness that turns into migraines. I haven’t had a migraine since I started coming here in April. I wish I started coming sooner! Her staff is professional and friendly.

Great doctors and great people. The environment is relaxing. Also recovery is easy as the doctor gives you exercises that can be done at home to help you get better. Overall, this is one of the best chiropractors I've ever had.</Text>

The best place for spinal care. I believe the care I received improved my kidney function. Prior to treatment my kidney function was at 2.8+, normal is 1.5-. Now it is at 1.8, the lowest since 2013. My mobility has greatly improve and I feel better overall.
The staff, Dr.Molly Cooper, Rance, Felipe, and Raena are wonderful. You will be greeted with hello and a smile. Very warm welcome.
Check them out, you will not be disappointed.< /Review>

<text>Dr. Cooper and her wonderful staff are truly that... wonderful!  They really know how to make you feel important and cared for.  I was rear-ended, and even though I've had a chiropractor since I was a child, that one didn't offer the physical therapy I needed.  That's when I met the incomparable Dr. Molly Cooper.  This place is the whole package.  Their rates are reasonable, and it's a loving, but professional atmosphere.  I will continue with them... even though she has taken my pain away!

<Pics>None</Pics><review>The best treatment I've ever had regarding chiropractic care. I came to Dr. Cooper in 2012 for a car accident my family was involved in and she took care of us. Foward to 2018 and I came once again to Dr. Cooper when I started having severe lower back pain. As always, she was always there to offer the best advice and care and with that caring and kind demeanor. Thanks to her and her amazing and caring staff, I began to feel a lot better after only 2 sessions and I was able to walk with more ease and regained most of my mobility. I would not recommend anyone else but Dr. Cooper and her staff to take care of you and your chiropractic needs.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dcd65d39044fdb:0x68cf32e2a8f845fb< /Gmap_id>< user_name>

<review>I've been going to HealthSource for a few years now. Once a week I get a massage from Lynette. Let me just start by saying Lynette is the best massage therapist I have ever encountered. She gives a deep tissue massage and hits all the right knots. My massage is immediately followed up by an adjustment and quick pep talk with Dr. Cooper. I always feel much better after leaving HealthSource and I recommend getting started on one of their physical therapy plans.

Thanks again</review><name>Jonathan Fotopoulos< /name>< Pictures>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>i remember the first day i was there approximately 3 months ago. I was in so much pain. They used some type of wand on my back and they showed me results on the computer. It registered the tightness in my back muscles and neck. The screen showed red all over, which indicated lots of strain and tightness. i was finally happy someone validated that i was in extreme pain. other doctors would tell me, yes there is strain in your neck and lower back but it is not extreme. why was i in so much pain? i asked. I have been going to HealthSource for 5 weeks now and feel so much better. Their approach is much more comprehensive. They incorporate exercises, massage, and therapy. IT WORKS! The key however is to do exercises at home too. The staff is outstanding. Thank you Dr. Cooper.< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
My wife began seeing Dr. Molly about a year and a half ago because of her low back pain.  She has a torn disk in her lumbar spine. She could not walk much except to take a shower or use the restroom. She was in bed for 2 weeks then we went to see Dr. Molly. Within 2 weeks she could at least stand up a little straighter and the back spasms were reduced. After 3 weeks she could stand up straight with good posture and no spasms. After about 5-6 weeks of seeing Dr. Molly 3 days a week her back was with no pain. My wife is back to work in the fitness industry using her back daily. If you need a chiropractor please go see Dr. Molly Cooper. I have recommended her to my friends and family and those who have gone have experienced great results. She is very friendly and personable. The office staff is amazing just as the doctor is.

Dr. Cooper and all of the staff at Healthsource in Anaheim are the best!  Dr. Cooper is very thorough in her treatment starting with a full evaluation of your present health condition and testing.  She then assesses for the best course of treatment with a goal of getting you off medication, healthy, pain free and happy.  Dr. Cooper and her staff truly care about each patient and success in their recovery.  The entire staff makes you feel so welcome.  I have been treating with Dr. Cooper for over 6 years for maintenance of a prior back injury.  Both of my children have also been treated by Dr. Cooper for various minor injuries due to sports and bike/skateboarding injuries.  My boys and I love Dr. Cooper and all of the staff.  They take care of us and treat us like family.  I always recommend Dr. Cooper to all of my co-workers and friends.  All of those who were referred have said the same thing… “I love Dr. Cooper!”  I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Cooper for any of your chiropractic needs.< /Review>

Raena at the front desk is just as amazing! Felipe has the best hands, if you're lucky enough to experience his massages I highly recommend it! If you are injured this is the best place to come!

Years of misfortune had left my back in the worst shape at the age of 27. No kind of medication would relieve this deep internal pain. I felt as if I had no more options. That I would grow into my old age with constant pain, leaving me in a wheelchair. When I decided to look for a chiropractor I was very skeptical. After a lengthy search and reading many reviews I decided to visit Dr. Cooper. Probably the best decision I've ever made for my well being. I can run, I can jump, I can pick things up again! It's amazing what a few adjustments, a peaceful massage, and precise exercise can do. Not to mention the ambiance of the office. And the welcoming personality of everyone that works there. I've had a great experience and I can't thank you enough. See you on Monday :)< /Review>

I drive 40 MILES just to see this amazing team! That should say enough about how good they are. Dr. Cooper is so warm and welcoming and oh so gentle with my fragile back. Raena and Rance at the front desk are super friendly and so helpful. Linette gives amazing massages that I refuse to live without, while Felipe puts my core to work with some fun exercises. I've remained loyal to this team for years now and will never let them go. Are they worth that crazy drive down the I-10 and the I-5? Always!</text>

I have been seeing Dr Cooper for a couple of months now, with incredible results.  After years of abuse via sports and outdoor activities, my back was in a lot of pain.  I was able to feel positive results within a couple of visits.  I am so grateful to Dr Cooper and her staff for the excellent care I have received and will continue to receive.< /Review>

Wonderful experience here so far! The entire chiropractic staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Dr. Cooper is a joy to be around and talks to you like a real person, not just a customer. It is obvious that she cares about her patients and their well-being!

I have been seeing Dr. Cooper now for about 5 weeks and most of my neck/back pain is gone or significantly reduced. Of course, as with anything, it takes time to notice results and some days are better than others but overall I am very happy with my care at health source. AND IT IS ALL NATURAL! No medicine or expensive equipment needed to correct my spinal issues. That's a big plus for me!<//text>

I work in a stressful field  with children and adolescent with intellectual disabilities and that are highly aggressive. Although I have learned how to avoid injury, I have seen that my body still reacts to stressful and aggressive situations I see daily. My husband starting seeing Dr. Cooper after he got into an accident. She has been doing a great job helping with his recovery. We are expecting our second child and have a two year old, so while we were waiting in the lobby for my husband I saw that they also have a massage club. We decided to try it, to see if it would help with decreasing stress and helping me sleep. I was starting to have a hard time sleeping because my body could not relax. I was so happy to learn that the massage therapist can also work on pregnant women. My massage was great and I was able to feel the difference completely throughout the week. Being able to sleep and have my body relax is so important to my family life, health and my job. Without it I would not be able to continue to work, because most of my clients read body language and can pick up if I am tense and will react with aggression towards me. I would recommend the massages to anyone.</Review>

Love this place! I definitely recommend. I was involved in a car accident and went in with very bad wrist, neck, and back pain and so far everything is feeling way much better than before. The workers there are very nice and friendly all smiles as soon as you walk in. Definitely a 5 star place!<//review>

<review>When I first met Dr. Cooper I had a stiff neck and pain starting from my left arm, giving my fingers a numbing sensation. I saw the sign for a free 10 minute massage from Dr. Cooper and signed up. She immediately recognized a problem. She suggested an x-ray to confirm the damage. She showed me a picture of a normal spine and then the different phases of spinal degeneration. She then showed me my x-ray. I was in phase three in the spine in the back of my neck! My nerve was being pinched causing pain in my shoulder blade, arm and causing the numbing sensation. Dr. Cooper suggested immediate intensive therapy which would gradually taper down to a regular visit. I am now 90% free from pain. I commend Dr. Cooper for her excellent and professional demeanor. She gave me full confidence in her ability and in her medical practice.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I have been a patient of Dr. Molly Cooper for over 10 years. Her and her staff genuinely care about my well being and health. I have a very rigious and physically demanding career and workouts. Dr. Cooper listens to me when I describe my symptoms and makes a realistic treatment plan for me. During the treatments, Dr. Cooper uses her "Magic Hands" I call her hands magic  because she identifies the problem area immediately and treats it.< /Review>

From the friendly staff Breanda, Felipe, and Rance to great care of Dr. Cooper my entire experience with them has been great. You can tell they really care about getting you back to normal. Anyone suffering from pain of any kind or as a result of a car accident should check them out! You won't be disappointed  I would recommend them to anyone! I'm so happy I found them and will be part of the health source family for life!<//review><gmapID>0x80dcd65d39044fdb:0x68cf32e2a8f845fb<//gmapID>< date>

Came here a few days after an auto accident... Walked in with neck and back pain. My body felt like it had been hit by a truck. I could not sit still or in a single portion for more than 10 mins. It was bad! It's only been a few weeks and can't believe how fast and how much the pain has decreased. I'm not 100% YET, but I'm confident Dr. Cooper will fix me completely! We gotta take care of our bodies! My daughters and I plan on continuing to take care of our bodies here! Great Dr's and staff!< /review>

<review>I've been seeing Dr. Cooper since I was a teenager. Whenever I don't feel well or have any sort of pain I go see her and it's like if she had a magic wand. Her treatments are right to the point no maybes!! She always straightens my problems and makes me feel better and with more energy. If you need a Quiropractor because of any pain or accident she is the Dr. to see. She has so much patience and explains it all. You are not just a patient to her but a part of the HealthSource Family and treated as such!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Cooper has been my treating physician for 14 years!!  Here team is very friendly, accommodating, compassionate & helpful.  When you step into the office you feel like your home because they know you by name.  She initially treated me for a work injury. I could barely walk and had excruciating pain. Because she treated me and gave me the Best care, I was able to walk down the aisle at my wedding!!  :)  She has also treated me for injuries from car accidents.  If I ever get a flare up, I can call and get an immediate appointment.  The massage therapist Lynette is Excellent and I would highly recommend her to get all the kinks out.  :) I have referred family, friends and co-workers to Healthsource of Anaheim Central and will continue!!

< Review>
Having Dr. Cooper as a doctor is a little short of a miracle. There's almost a sense of completion along with relaxation when she's done adjusting you. I came to her with intense shoulder pain, she immediately began treating me from the source. No take this pill, take that pill.... she finds problems from the core and starts you on a therapy plan. It's incredible... i will never leave her....never! I'm a nurse, it's hard on my feet, my back, basically my entire body. I walk 13 hours a day or more, I have two jobs and school. Finding Dr. Cooper gave me ability to do all the things I have to do. Without her, i would be burnt out and in pain. I sleep better, i'm walking better, my pain is gone, my mood has changed. If you even have something as little as insomnia or controlling blood pressure, or as big as a subluxation or dislocated disc, she will fix it. don't count too heavily on medications, my friends, they only treat the immediate symptoms.<//Review>

I love Healthsource of Anaheim. Dr Cooper and the entire staff have changed my life. I walked in with some underlying health issues and unbearable pain in my lower back and pelvis. A month and a half later and I truly feel that my pain is so much more manageable now. Women, if you are having painful times of the month, consider chiropractic, It has done so much for me. I feel safe and loved here, and believe me when is say, you can talk to Dr Cooper about anything.. she is the most caring and sincere person I have ever encountered. If you are in pain, there is hope, and there is help! Healthsource is not just a place to get adjustments, but somewhere they teach you how to care for your spine through physical therapy, relief through massage, and the importance this all has on your overall health.

P.s. you will not find a better massage than you will receive here!</text>

I started seeing Dr. Cooper after I had been in a car accident, I was in so much pain in my back and neck. The pain was unbearable, I had never been to a chiropractor before and didn't really know if it would help, but just after a couple of visits my pain subsided, now after a couple months I hardly have any pain at all. Dr. Cooper is a miracle worker, I would recommend any of my family and friends to her.<//Review>

<review>Let me start by saying how friendly, knowledgable and willing to help Dr. Cooper and her staff are. They go the extra mile to help you and make you feel extremely comfortable. They get to know you and, after a while, it feels as if you are visiting friends. Raena always welcomes you to the office with a warm and friendly smile, Felipe (super friendly and courteous fellow) puts your body to work with core excercises as well as therapy.  And last but not least, Linette whom is an expert massage therapist.

They truly do amazing work and thanks to them, I am getting back to my olf self. Thank you for your hard work and patience.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

This location NEVER answers the phone! Want to have them cater? You have to go in person to make arrangements.
Want to order for Christmas/ New Year's? Forget it, this location will be closed for the holidays.
Seems they don't want your business as they will not answer the phone or take orders for the end of the year holidays.
Too bad, as their food is good but their business management is pathetic.< /review>

Finally got around to trying Luisa and Sons in Cerritos. They're situated in strip lot on South Street, next to Cafe 86. It's a small bakery serving up classic Filipino pastries and desserts like egg pie, cassava, turon, sponge cake mamon and many more. What caught my eye was their display case of hopia which I heard was good. They have several selections on hand like mung bean, red bean, ube and baboy (made out of pork fat, candied winter melon and green onions).

I decided to try a dozen ube hopia (85 cent each) and half dozen chicken empanadas. The chicken empanadas were tasty and crust was on point, but unfortunately their ube hopia was a complete disappointment. The ube flavor was lacking and quality of crust wasn't flaky. Both essential characters to good hopia. it just tasted like standard pastries without any soul and originality.

All in all, the experience was okay. The hopia place near my house is so much better. Return visit is unlikely, but if you decide to come here anyways skip the ube hopia.

Note: For some nutritional facts, mongo or mung bean helps lower blood cholesterol levels, helps prevent breast cancer and also it has low sugar level. So if ever you are on a strict diet, this hopia mongo will surely be a good pick. Make sure to mention that to your doctor. Hahaha!< /text>

< Review>
It's a nice little store.  Many items filipino flavor but the only problem is the Turon. My wife and I went  in today to get turon. There were 5 in the tray.  Of course the greedy man in front of us takes all 5. We ask if there is more...sure there is the guy says but it is all for placed orders...these are just extra we sale up front. That is so wrong...Turon should b available til the eve...dont aay no to a customer...that just makes us not want to go back...make the sale.  Avoid losing face</Review>

<text>I was recommended to visit Luisa and Sons Bake Shop for great Lumpia's. I happened to be in the area doing some shopping and my Google maps brought up that I was within distance of a place I wanted to visit. I am so glad to have that option set and to maps running in the background of my phone. I did not realize how close I was and have wanted to visit for some time now.  I was too late for Lumpia's, as the friendly staff informed me they sell out early on weekends and it's better to place an order in advance. I will tell you their baked goods did not disappoint! I enjoyed the brownies, marbled bread and banana bread on this trip and look forward to coming back for some "ube" goodies. I was so excited to be there, I forgot to take pictures. Next time. Enjoy!</text><Name>E Barrios</Name></record>

Such good pastries. I really like the chicken empanadas (90 cents a pop) and the ubehopias (50 cents). The chicken empanadas are the perfect mix of sweet and savory. The ubehopias are choc full of sweet, smooth ube.

This is a really cute Filipino bakery that you should check out if you're in the area!</Review>

<Review>If you are in Cerritos area and want a quick fix to your Filipino cuisine craving, this is a good place to go. They have siopao, palabok,  guinatan, ensaymada, freshly baked hopia,  empanadas and a lot more. Turon and okoy are always disappearing from the shelf. Sometimes you'd need to wait for the next batch or order in advance.< /Review>< pictures>

I so wish they had more locations , this is a must go to spot for some yummy mierenda (snacks) and desserts and some pre-cooked foods . I always make a point to stop at one of their locations, when I'm in the area . They are one of the few locations that's offers chicken and pork bola bola siopao . They also have amazing variety of these candied calls and boat tarts . Not to many places make these candies goodies .
They used to make a good pancit palabok, but I must say they have a new recipe or different cook. I do prefer the older version of the palabok verses this new one .
But , not to worry I'll still come here for their many goodies to choose from.</Review>

Just $0.60 gets you one of these bad boys, the Pilipino chicken empanada
Flaky, sweet, savory & oh so delicious!  Tender pieces of chicken, carrots and raisins stuffed inside a buttery crust.  I can polish off about 75 of these during one sitting ;p

Luisa & Sons is a Pilipino bakeshop offering traditional cuisine from the homeland, both savory & sweet.

Fresh baked goods are prepared daily & gobbled up by the masses

Have a sweet tooth?  No problem!  Luisa & Sons offers delectable treats to satisfy your sugar fix

Besides the sweets & baked goods, savory dishes are available for purchase in the freezers and for pre-order food trays, such as sisig & dinuguan.  My family has often ordered a tray of pancit malabon (Pilipino noodle dish) & a box of empanadas for special occasions.  They're always a hit & nary a leftover afterwards.

Service has always been good.  I'm a regular, so the staff already knows they have to restock their supplies once I'm done shopping ;p

Parking is in the Unimart shopping plaza, shared with Milk & Honey, Azon & Canaan restaurants, among others.

What da bloody heck ya waitin for?  Go to Luisa & Sons Bakeshop already!

Highly recommend!

Whoa whoa whoa!

I found my go-to spot for CASSAVA CAKE. We devoured it!

In addition to CHEESE CROISSANT ROLLS (similar to Portos' Cheese Rolls but BETTER)

I also tried the Beef Empanada which was also delish since I love raisins in those!

Must come back for Siopao, Halo Halo, and turon!

The sign looks like Suisa & Son's which threw me off a bit, but right next to a super market and Milk & Honey!< /Review>

This was a wonderful experience at Rick's the people are so friendly there and the service is so right on the clam chowder was delicious and the the salad was wonderful too it's one of those places where you get a root beer float and they keep your glass full of root beer I love it I've been going to Rick's bakery for 22 years and Rick's grill is as good if not better than Rick's bakery love it there plus they have a bar with live music coming soon.< /Text>

<Review>Pretty good Cuban food. The black beans were on point and the Puerco Asado was amazing. The mojo for their yuca fries could use a little more garlic, but that's really my only complaint.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0jmK5_rzkJ1i_yJrGQBsdvwG0R8X_889YICki=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGQULssPhj09qIldpejUOXKFaTlKdyTeSDRiVx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

Staff in a great mood which was contagious. Cuban food really excellent: lechón, plátanos and flan.< /Review>< pictures>

It's not much from the outside, but once you get inside you are surrounded by historical pictures of Palm Springs in the movie stars that used to hang out in town. I was totally impressed with the food, high quality and delicious! The service was also very prompt and courteous. I'll be back soon.</text>

We ordered take out: chicken tamales w/rice and beans; 2 tostones (1 picadillo, 1 ropa viejo) w/rice and beans and a pear mojito. Everything tasted great. I was tempted to go back for another pear mojito and picadillo tostones, so delicious. Mngr. got our take out ready. I really felt appreciated and safe coming in to pick up dinner that night. They are following all the state mandated protocols regarding Covid sanitation.< /Review>

<text>Mixed thoughts.  I've not had restaurant nachos, where it's taken as a serious dish and prepared as such, in quite a while.  They were enjoyable and entertaining.
I'm not sure if we caught a bad night, but service was struggling to do basics. I Had to get silverware off another table when our waiter was gone after dumping soup and salad.  The salad was large chopped iceburg tossed on a plate too small for the quantity.
The main dishes, fried vegetables and mushroom ravioli, were less problematic. The fried vegetables, especially the spinich were good.< /text><user_id>105192546618511569184< /user_id><Response>None< /Response><rating>3< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I ordered the reuben sandwich with 1/2 Pastrami and have corned beef and it was excellent they wanted to know if I wanted fries and I asked what else was available and I chose potato salad the potato salad was excellent also. They must have given me two pounds of potato salad I couldn't believe how big of a portion it was! Very good food I'll be back<//Review>< pictures>

Excellent! I read an ad and short promotional article; it was not exaggerated. Place is inviting, clean, and bright. We went for late lunch about 230 pm. All menu items were available. Staff was friendly and attentive and answered all our questions regarding items not familiar to us. We settled on a toasted ham sandwich and side salad and Havana Burrito. Both were excellent! The greens were fresh, the sourdough bread was fresh, the pulled pork in the burrito was juicy and the black beans and rice with bacon absolutely scrumptious! I liked the twist of a fried egg on top. The side salsa was so tasty, not just overwhelming with chili peppers. I also had a perfect Mojito. We will return for another meal!<//review>

The Roast beef hash superb. Our wit staff had a smile at our table in less that 5 minutes. It had pictures of old Palm Springs life eg. Desi and Lucille Ball. Try this great salsa with bits of garlic in it.< /Review>

The service is good and the location is good. The food is incredibly average. The decor is dated and very tired. Overall the experience was ok. It's not someplace that I would highly recommend but it'll do in a pinch.</Text>

<review>Friendly staff, nice variety on menu, some vegan or vegetarian selections available. I enjoyed my impossible burger with veggies, barbecue sauce, etc. I plan to go back! Breakfast menu looked good, more vegetarian options (like maybe a veggie sausage) I would rate 5 stars!< /review>< gmapID>

I experienced the best Cuban 🇨🇺 Sandwich at Rick's!
Everything I had and I had heard about this Delectable Restaurant....was 100% on point!
Be assured that they definitely have a new guest at the meal table🙏🏿😋😎!<//Text>

<Review>My family and I had the most incredible Thanksgiving dinner here. It was the first year they’ve offered Thanksgiving meals. I’ve patronized many other Palm Springs restaurants during the holidays and I have to say the quality and presentation of Rick’s menu was equal to or better than most of them — at half the price! Kudos to the chef. And to Rick, his family, and his great staff.</Review>< Pics>

Why, oh why, would you eat anything but the Cuban food here? The Tostones are wonderful and the Yucca Frites? The bomb. We did a lot of dining out in Palm Springs but this meal was the most memorable. Also one of the least expensive. Thanks for a great meal!< /Review>

<Review>Our group had a much needed relaxing and fun late lunch here this last week! Some of us had been traveling for a few days and it was great to sit down to a nice meal with fantastic service. Our server, John, was friendly, professional, and personable! We loved the food and drinks! Specifically the pork sliders and the mojitos! My only regret is not saving enough room for one of the amazing looking cinnamon rolls... oh my... A patron had come in specifically for one. I could see why!! Love this place and I plan on returning on my next visit (hopefully soon) to Palm Springs!</Review>< Pics>

The only place in the Desert you can find a Cuban sandwich and other Cuban American items on the menu along with traditional American food. Quality well prepared food and good service.  Great Tuesday menu specials with low prices and great cocktail specials from 3-7pm.< /review>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>Really solid Cuban food. Servers are really friendly. They have a kids menu. Happy hour specials seem to run pretty regularly. We got in at a little before 7pm and 7pm is when the happy hour ends but they still offered us the happy hour items. Also, got free deviled eggs to start. Caramel flan for dessert was delicious.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

There is an awesome collection of the historical photography inside. Staff is perfectly trained with hospitality service. Food is tasty, moderately salt and spice. The size of dish is acceptable.</Review>

Wasn't too thrilled with this place  was hoping to have more aunthentic Cuban atmosphere. Literally felt like an American diner. Their menu was 95% American food with 5% Cuban. Definitely should change the description just to American cuisine. Tried the "Media Noche" and wasn't impressed.
Gave 2 stars for service & because they had decent fries.<//Text>

We grew up back east, and grew up enjoying Cuban cuisine. This location nails it, and we love the ambiance of old Palm Springs/Hollywood Starlets that considered PS home.
The plantains are my husband's favorite :)
The Cuban is delicious...YUM!</Text>

<Text>Dinner comes in medium (called petite but its adequate) and full portions.  Atmosphere was pleasant and we requested a booth in our own room. Choices are simple and varied. 1940s motiff and 50s music piped in overhead.  Not loud bur you can Shazam easily if you don't recall the name of the song.  Overall fun American cuisine. Prices are moderate.  Around $80 for four people. Few desserts but I was full. Even took some home for later. Birthdays welcome and free flan for your honoree. 4.5 of 5 stars.  Free and plenty of parking.< /Text><UserId.>114232058101294858917</UserId.></record>

<Review>Food is good and comfortable ambiance and friendly staff.
We were in a private party and there was only one waiter to take care of upwards of 30 + people. He worked very hard and did a yeoman's job of trying to take care of everyone. This is not a staff problem but a magement problem. More staff should have been assigned to our party. We had reservations weeks in advance. And this is not the first time this happened to a private gathering we have been included in.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I rarely think of Rick's. Even though I live close by, it's an invisible place. Food is fine. The Petite Meals fills me up since I eat out often, I don't want a huge meal all the time. Yet when a friend mentions it, I'm there!</text>

Great relaxed and stylish atmosphere!  Staff was attentive - though the waiter seemed newish, making an effort to please : ) Large range of ages, enjoying Sunday morning breakfast.  Reminded me of our go-to restaurant (30 years and counting) back in Michigan.  I'll be back.< /review>

A hidden gem in Palm Springs, popular with the locals and long term regulars.  The excellent, friendly and confident staff seem like they've been there for years, love their jobs, and get along great with each other. Really go out if their way to make you feel welcome and offer suggestions.  Great good too- much higher than expected quality for a restaurant in this price range.  Have eaten here three times this week and looking forward to returning.</Review>

<Review>We had a long drive from the Bay Area so we were all tired and miserable and was hoping we would have a good meal at this restaurant. The server welcomed us and was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed during our meal. The food was delicious. Our ribeye steak was tender and juicy and the fried chicken was also very tasty. Our penne pasta was slightly over cooked but it was still good. Will definitely come here if we visit Palm Springs again.</Review><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<text>The best part of my dinner was the coffee.  I wanted to order from the lunch menu, but the waiter told me that I could only order from the dinner menu at that time (about 5:45).  I have been there several other times, and was always allowed to order a sandwich from the lunch menu, nearly at the same time in the late afternoon, (mainly because I did not like the dinner menu choices). So, I ordered from the dinner menu anyway. After ordering, just next to me was a couple, and right in front of me, he brought their dinner, and the lady had a sandwich that looked like a club sandwich (or turkey club). Now, I hardly ever complain, but he has done this to me before.  I guess that I am not considered equal to the other customers. If I ever decide to go back, I will make sure to find another server.....and to top it off, the salad looked like a child's salad, the turkey dinner was sliced as if it was for a sandwich, the dressing was like mush, and part of the vegetables were honestly, as if part of them were not even warm, but cold like just out of the refrigerator.   Just cannot believe that they could have overlooked so many things.   Yes, I will go back, but hope that next time it is a better experience. (They should also take into consideration, that they are overpriced for what they serve).< /text>< pics>

Great menu. Like the option of ordering small plates. Moderately priced, Cuban influence a nice touch. Ambiance is great with open air, well lighted. Lots of pictures of old Palm Springs and famous movie stars.</Text>

All around top notch resturant. Ordered the meatloaf which was sublime, and the veggies were fresh. They threw in a free deviled egg b/c it was near closing which I enjoyed. Chicken Breast soup was tasty as well. Worth the drive.< /text>

I ordered the special of the day and it was absolutely delicious. It was their version of eggs benedict with bacon but instead of an English muffin, you get a Belgian waffle and gravy. My doctor probably won't appreciate it but my belly loved it. :)< /review>

Rick's Desert Grill is a good eatery you can always count on. The dishes are fresh, straight forward, some with a Cuban flair, and the staff are super friendly. They also serve cocktails.  It's located on the north end of Palm Canyon Drive, and I often go there after arriving late to Palm Springs when I know other restaurants are full, or I just want a non-pretentious, relaxing environment .
Rick's begins every dinner with complimentary deviled eggs, a very retro and homey touch. You immediately feel you're in the smaller Palm Springs zone. I often start with one of their tasty home made soups, which they also serve at Rick's Deli up the road. The menu features grilled salmon, fried chicken, Aroz con Pollo, and turkey dinners, too.  It has something for everyone without being a huge menu.
Rick's also displays wonderful black and white photography of historical Palm Springs from the 1930's-50's, featuring a beautiful Lucille Ball in palazzo pants, Bob Hope holding a ham, Cary Grant lounging in his pool, and many others. It's all very understated and comfortable.
Although I often visited Rick's other eatery, Rick's Deli, for their amazing breakfasts and lunches, I would always pass the Desert Grill because it looked sterile on the outside and was located on the corner of a busy intersection. Once I went, it soon became a favorite. I am glad Rick's Desert Grill has become one of my staples in Palm Springs.</text>

Authentic Cuban fare available. Family is of Cuban origin. I had one of the better media noche sandwhich ever.   Better than some of the cuban restaurants in Miami.  The side rice and beans with great seasoning.  With fried plantain.  And the flan at the end with cuban coffee rounded out the meal.  Definitely a return visit if int he Palms Springs area.</text>

Not a speck of egg in sight and SUPER sweet from all the icing.  Our waiter was kind enough to include syrup in case it wasn't quite sweet enough. Now if you want a cinnamon bun, it was great, but getting it this way was twice the price and was not like any French Toast I've ever had.  It was just an expensive Cinnamon Bun.

Always good food and service.  Large variety of choices with an emphasis on Cuban cusine.  The fried chicken, pot pie and turkey dinners are limited quantity and go quickly.< /review>

Cuban and American food under one roof. I'm not even sure I like Cuban food because the tuna melt here is so good, it's all I ever order. Service is friendly, and food arrives quickly. Highly recommended.< /Text>

We split the Media Noche sandwich and the Cuban trio which were stuffed tostones with roast pork, picadillo, and ropa vieja. Both dishes were scrumptious with lots of flavor. Also had a Cuban coffee which was very good. Would definitely recommend, great value and good service.</Review><Time>1546382981894<//Time><user>101536335442608432542< /user>< Pictures>

I drive pass by this place so many times while taking my son to school and it never occur to me to stop by because of the outer appearance.  In a nutshell, the food is great and the mojito is to die for!  My husband ordered a grilled ribeye and I ordered a pull pork dish.  They both came out wonderful.  The meat is so moist and juicy.  The rice with beans and plantain on the side were a nice touch.  My 2 year old, who's usually a very picky eater, loved the squash soup that came with the pulled pork.  He drank more than half in less than 5 minutes!  The food taste so good here, they honestly don't need to worry about decoration or anything else.</Review>

< Review>
This place looks so nondescript and bland from the street that it took us a long time to drop in. This 4 stars is for the breakfast. That's the only meal we had and it was absolutely delicious. I had a mushroom Swiss omlette. It says it's made with 3 eggs but it seemed more like 5 and it was stuffed to overflowing with mushrooms and cheese. Price is a little higher than johns/Denny's/IHOP but it's worth it for the flavours!<//Review>

It was very delicious. I ordered the salmon with Cuban  beans and rice. Our appetizer was Garlic Cheesebread with their homemade cream of mushroom soup. An excellent coffee drink cafe de lechee for after dinner. Our service was excellent.<//Review>

Worst service I've ever had! I could not get them to bring me what I ordered. After a couple tries, I gave up. My husband finally ordered it for himself, then gave it to me. Unless you fit a certain criteria, you CANNOT get fried fish tacos here, APPARENTLY. By the time we left, my inability to count as a human being in this establishment had me in tears.< /review>

Found a gem of a restaurant with food similar to what I grew up eating. I'm half Puerto Rican, and loved the fried plantain.  I ordered the Cuban stuffed tostones, all delicious and authentic,  and my husband had the media noche sandwich.  It was his first Cuban meal and he loved it. I  definitely will be back.

I orderd a filet mignon medium. When it came out it was about 1/2 inch tall and looked like it was cooked all day cause it shrank. And it was cooked well well done. It looked like it was cooked in a George Forman grill. It was the most bootlegged steak I had ever attempted to eat. Needless to say I sent it back and didnt order anything else to eat. I will not go there again....<//review>

(Translated by Google) Visited for breakfast. Nothing to say perfect. Classic American breakfast. Price maybe a little above average

(Translated by Google) The place is a little cold, not very characteristic.
Appetizers of fried yucca good, as well as meat, but the side dish of frozen vegetables is heated in the oven, paired with the mashed modified with the cream on top that had vulcanized.
All not even given.

(Original)
Il posto è un po' freddino, poco caratteristico.
Antipasti di yucca fritta buono, così come la carne, ma il contorno di verdure surgelate è riscaldate al forno, ha fatto coppia col purè modificato con la crema sopra che si era vulcanizzata.
Il tutto nemmeno regalato.</review>
