< review>
I went there with a $130 quote for a diagnostic which grew to $500 without it being fixed and when I picked up the car the bill said $630 and my car runs worse then it ever has. They ended up rigging the wires and by passing the computer which I didn't want. I paid for them to learn or practice on my car. In the end Francisco told me to F-off and never come back...WHY? BECAUSE I SPIKE THE TRUTH IN FRONT OF HIS OTHER CUSTOMER AND EXPOSED HIM FOR THE HACKER HE IS.<//review>

<Text>Got my ac repair, electrical and check engine light 🕯️ finally repaired. Although I drive an older car 🚗 francisco still took care of me. Some oc mechanics would just tell me buy a new car. But francisco knows cars very well and is one of those mechanics who can just drive your car and can tell what is wrong immediately. This kind of experience is why i keep coming back and will recommend Francisco to family and friends.</Text>< Rating>

Came in for an oil change and head light replacement. Left with an 800 dollar bill and more parts broken than fixed. USED to be a reputable mechanic but seems they hired a bunch of scam artists instead. Avoid this place!!<//Text>

<Review>Last week my car shut down on me in the middle of the road. I was stuck but Francisco got me a towing service quickly. He diagnosed the problem and fixed my car very quickly. He was able to charge me less than the dealer and even gave me a list of upcoming services I need to look into. He is the best in the industry. HIGHLY RECOMMEND him.< /Review>< Rate>

I'd gone to this place when my check engine light went on and the owner told me they found nothing. When he talked to me about the charge he told me that it was a usual of $115, but he would just charge me $55. I knew that he was a shady character the moment he mentioned the money issue. I never went back.
I'd gone to plenty of other auto shops when my check engine light went on and if there was nothing wrong they didn't charge me. I don't recommend this place at all and those considering - BEWARE. You take your chances.</text>

Francisco is the best! He is always so honest, so quick, and his staff is so knowledgeable! My husband would not take his Jeep anywhere else because no one can be trusted like Francisco! They have a little waiting area that you can use while your car is being fixed, or they will drop you off at work and come pick you up later if you need it! It's so convenient and so nice of them.<//Review>

Francesco let us bring our motorhome in on Saturday afternoon and his guys fixed an old problem w gas filler hose which spoiled our trip to Sequoia yesterday!
Many thanks to him and all his team! If we were in NYC he’d be called a “mensch”
Highest compliment! Travelers will be treated like family! Vielen danke schoen in Austrian!</Text>

I have been dealing with Francisco's for several years. Honest, fair and just great people. My wife has a Isuzu trooper and when dealerships closed it was hard to find a place for service. Thanks to Francisco my wife's Trooper is closing in on 185,000 and still going strong. My cars are getting older and it's important for me to keep them running and Francisco's does a great job.<//Text>

(Saturday) I was desperately needing Auto service and called many places with no luck! Finally,  I got of hold of Francisco's Auto Repair and told him (Francisco himself) my situation and without any hesitation he said, "sure come on over" . I was there in 10 min and what I needed done was done in 10 min!!! It was a great experience and I would recommend this auto shop to anyone and everyone! Thanks so much
Francisco for the awesome customer service!!!!</review>

I used Francisco on a few occasions over time and was duped into believing his BS in the beginning until it finally dawned on me what this guys 3 step business model is, and that is;
- Charm the customer that its all in good hands.
- He gives a verbal approximate quote that seems reasonable.
- When the job is done the final bill is always 40-50% above what he quoted verbally initially with some BS story of challenges encountered, tinged with him trying to be charming.
Be warned about Francisco. Don’t trust this guy, tell him to put a quote in writing before you give any ok for repairs.< /review>< Pictures>

I have been taking our family vehicles to Francisco's for over 12 years and have recommended them to others. Their work is thorough and prices, while not cheap, are fair. Having the ability to speak to someone very familiar with the work performed on the vehicle versus a person who merely writes up the service order is big advantage over the service departments of auto dealerships.< /Review>

Francisco always always takes care of my car. I needed to get it smogged and he fixed a whole bunch of issues that meant I wasn't going to pass. When I took it over to the smog place across the way, there was a loose connection, so the technician sent me back over to Francisco's. The owner himself came out and fixed the hose no charge!

I will always come here because the quality is completely unmatched. It's so good to have my own mechanic that I can trust.</text>

Cars just don't like me but, thankfully Francisco’s Automotive  is always there to fix whatever happens to my car or my wife’s! They're very well priced, very efficient, and very customer service oriented! Leah and Francisco not only are great to work with but, everyone is friendly and nice to each other. It seems like everyone is happy to be there.

So I’ve had batteries die, my car's ac condenser started leaking (yes, in the summer), I knocked off my side mirror,  we've had Francisco work with my insurance company with no hassle. They even helped us with rides home from the shop and always calls with an update on when we can pick the cars up. This place is great I'll take my car there for anything that goes wrong! Customers for life!<//text>

Francisco was recommended by a relative and friend
after having the dealer tell me that there was nothing wrong with my car. I decided to go to Fransisco to give him a try, and it was one of the best decisions I could of made. Not only did he drive my car but he found the problem and fixed it the same day. I am sooo greatful for his business and I wish there were more mechanics like him<//text>

<text>Francisco's overcharged me for a diagnosis and induction cleaning, told me my truck was fine. My engine blew within a month of them servicing it. I don't know what a $200 dollar diagnosis should cover, but I would expect that if they told me my engine was fine, that it would be. I will never use these guys again. I will probably take them to court to get my money back since they also refused to refund me on their misdiagnosis.</text>< user_name>

This place is AWESOME!!  I recommend Francisco's Auto Repair for professional and trustworthy service. We live in LA and my car broke down because of a cracked radiator in the Huntington Beach area and I had no idea where to take my car to be fixed. We first had the car towed the local Pep Boys and they gave me a ridiculously high estimate. Fortunately, we looked online again and found Francisco's. Eric and Leah were incredibly helpful and gave us a very fair estimate for replacing the radiator and 2 tires. They were also very fast...our car was ready to be picked up the same day that we dropped it off. They even surprised us and had it washed. What more could you ask for! Thank you!!< /Review>

Toyota failed to mention the tires needing to be replaced. I commute three hours a day and the tires could have blown out at any time!!

So i have been using Francisco’s Automotive for years but just getting to a review of them after my most recent visit.

I first heard about them through a friend who would take his finicky Audi to them from time to time. They always did good for him so I decided to trust them with the 3 cars in my household. What I love about them is that they don't up sell you and they give you options that can fit your budget without cutting corners or making your car unreliable. I really appreciate that level of help and service.

For my most recent visit, I brought in a car for routine maintenance for a road trip to Texas. My mind was put at ease with their work and inspection for potential problems.<//Text>

This shop always keeps my vehicles running in great shape and reminds me without pressure, when service is due.  There are many things I like about this establishment.  First and foremost is trust integrity.  I can count on Francisco himself to ensure my vehicle is safe at his shop and that he and his trained staff have my best interest in mind.  Let’s face it; I typically visit this shop when my vehicle needs maintenance.  As a result, I am not in the best spirits because I know this is going to cost money.  Francisco knows this ensures that me that I’m not being take advantage of.  He all provides a complete breakdown of costs and replaces items with OEM parts.  Yes, that is expensive but, that’s the price of car ownership.  Unfortunately, I’ve learned the hard way by taking my vehicle elsewhere; only have Francisco clean up someone else’s subpar repair.  Francisco does what it takes to explain things and perhaps a learning opportunity for me to mitigate possible damage to the car going forward.  Finally, I’ve learned that Francisco actually saves me money by providing advice based on his many years of training and the talented staff he has on board.  I feel really lucky to have solid business partnership with Francisco and I look forward to Francisco and his trained staff to provide me the excellent care for my automotive needs and address my concerns professionally.  Today, it is very difficult to find these attributes as part of the DNA in the automotive repair business and takes pride in the service they provide.</text>< rate>

If you want to treat yourself to a relaxing and WELL DONE manicure service - DO NOT CHOOSE THIS PLACE! Zero care about attention to detail. He was rude and did a terrible job with my cuticle and nail beds. I do better manicures for myself which made me feel like my money was wasted. The energy is rushed which eliminates any idea for pampering, and some elements of the manicure service were left out, and the polish was sloppily applied. My advise to anyone when it comes to getting natural nail care services like manicures is to go somewhere else. I won’t return. The reason I gave one star was because of the woman who did my pedicure, otherwise it would have been none.</Text>

< review>
I had a acrylic nail gel set along with a pedicure gel and in total it was $77 when they told me it would be $36 in total. They OVERPRICED me. I loved coming here until this occurred I will not be coming back. I got my pedicure done on Friday 4 days ago. And they look like I need a refill it’s ridiculous. My pedicure nail polish came off I’m not sure what nail polish they are using. My acrylic nails need a refill and want to come off. I don’t recommend this place.</review>

I only come here to pass time while waiting for my car to get serviced. This place is way too expensive, prices increase every time I come here, even before the pandemic. Technicians ask if you want something done, without informing you it’s an extra charge. That’s not good customer service at all. Very good pedicure, but I’ll find something else to pass the time.< /text>

First time going there and I have no regrets what so ever. The shape and color is everything! And the prices are really low and good. $40 for a acrylic set . I will definitely become a regular customer and definitely recommend this place for everyone else.</review>

< Review>
This was my 2nd time here. My first experience was excellent, this last experience was awful when I decided to get a manicure with gel nail polish. The lady doing them was awful & she kept filing my nails even after the final polish was applied.. I told her you’re filing away the nail polish & to do them over.. that too was horrible. It looks as though I need a do over badly!! I can’t stand when I can’t communicate when I’m paying for a service. No complaints for the lady that did my pedicure. I left a small tip & it should have all went to the pedicure lady. $68.00 for what?< /Review>

<review>This place is beautiful...nice soft and serine music playing...never used a paper towel once to dry my hands after getting my nails done because they always have nice fresh towels to use next to the bowl which is lit up in blue with rocks on the bottom! The staff is very accommodating...very clean! They never rush through your service in order to take in more clients...your time is your time. I absolutely love this place! You won't be disappointed!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rating>

Not the best customer service for new clients. The person that greeted me at the door pointed towards the rear of the building told me to go and pick a nail polish. Then I was never escorted to the salon chair so I just stood around and final a woman that didn't speak English to well waved me down to come to her...  😨😨😨<//Review>

I went to serenity nails for the first time about a week and a half ago, and within 2 days I had to go
back twice for broken nails . They fixed it I left 2 days later another nail broke. And the chrome was so cheap I was at work washing dishes and the chrome just peels off.< /Text>

I reviewed this place before with bad experience and tried them out again to give them a chance. I got my gel Friday, the next day 2 of my gel came off. Came back for them to fixed it Sunday and again it came off Tuesday. I should just get regular manicure instead of getting gel that supposed to last atleast 2 weeks.< /text>

<name>Annabella Willson<//name><review>Been coming here since about two years and promised myself I’d stop coming two months ago but my friend forced me to come back with her a few days ago.. really terrible service with rude workers. Just because you have a few chandeliers and nice decorations doesn’t mean you don’t have to put effort into your customers. The time prior before I came back recently all of my nails popped off after 5 days. This time the lady used the wrong size acrylic nails for me and everything looks so sloppy especially the polish and each nail has a different shape.. not to mention my 8 minute $25 pedicure. definitely not coming back from now on< /review><user>112743127192903253997< /user><date>1535842624254</date>< pictures>

<text>People here are getting lazier by the minute, three years coming here but I believe it is time to change. Kim doesn't do the same quality job she used to. She was very detailed with the nail acrylic shape and polish, I believe once you become a regular they don't pay as much attention to quality. The husband is like he is racing to get done with you, not gentle at all with your hands. I always try to think that maybe they are having a bad day or they are tired, but it never changes. Sloppy job, nail polish quality is disgusting (watered down) or better said so reduced with chemicals. Not worth the $35 I pay for refill. What ever happened to the spa relaxing music? Katie Perry and Drake now on full blast ...and let's not talk about the pedicures, the girls don't know much. Sorry to be a troll, but I am very disappointed at this place, being that it has a lot of potential.<//text><Name>margarita contreras< /Name>< user>

Good prices but staff is not friendly... Lady doing my nails spoke to me maybe 3 times and that was to ask me what color I wanted and if she had trimmed my nails short enough. When I tried to ask questions it was like she didn't want to engage in a conversation but the minute her coworker started talking to her she wouldn't shut up< /text>

I came here once a few months ago on a whim, but I was SO pleased with the service and results! I continued going to my regular nail salon which is closer to my job, but today I had a "mommy's ME day" and wanted to come back. I rode around for 30 mins looking for this place (which should tell you how awesome they are for me to waste gas) but couldn't for the life of me remember the name or exact location. Long story short, I FOUND IT! Now this is my second time coming and I'm ready to break up with my other nail lady officially now! I had extremely bad calluses on both feet, but when I tell you after that paraffin treatment, OMG! Those callus are gone and my feet are as smooth as my baby's. I HIGHLY recommend Serenity Nail Salon, namely Kimberly!< /Review>

I just tried this place.  It's closer to home and the price is about the same as the place I usually go.  I was disappointed.  I got the pedicure that has the foot and leg massage.  I guess the massage was the few seconds she rubbed lotion on my feet.  Guess I'll be going back to my usual place.</text>

<Text>I've been here twice and both times the people who did my nails were so rough with my nails. The first time my nails weren't even shaped right and they were so thick. Second time the lady was so rough that she was using the drill thing on my skin and she didn't even paint my nails all the way. This is the worst salon. Very unpleasant.< /Text>< Pictures>

The level of professionalism and friendliness is off the charts here.
They always sound like they're in a good mood and turn my day around every time I call them.
They're quick,  they're helpful,  they're PROFESSIONAL. I highly recommend this location in particular. You guys are awesome.< /review>

< Review>
Got here late from my flight. I arrived at 5:15pm
Everywhere online says 6pm.

Their LGB airport location won’t answer their phone either to help resolve this.

Heading over to enterprise. Hertz never again.<//Review>

The staff is incredible. The problem is that Hertz needs more employees to handle the customers. Hertz should be very proud of these hard workers.<//Text>

< review>
I rent cars frequently, but this Lakewood Plaza HLE location is kind of a joke. Every time I come, it takes 30 minutes or more to actually drive away with my car. Either they only have one associate and a line of customers, or the car has to be washed/picked up from another location, or they simply can't find my reservation. Now with COVID going on, it's even worse. I LOVE Hertz as a whole, but this location definitely needs new management.</review>

<user_id>105432250794694053311<//user_id><Review>Rented a car months ago. During the rental period I could never get a consistent answer on my rental issues. Car sounded like it had a diesel engine and guzzled gas. Called to extend the rental days prior to my original return date. Yet, into the 2nd week of having the rental I continously received threading calls about having an overdue rental. Months later we received a notice from Hertz stating there was a parking ticket, even though we never received one on the vehicle. Paid it and their "administration" fees. 3 months later another notice appears asking for payment of $180 for the ticket we "received" even though we paid their scammer fees on the original notice. Never ever again.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Not sure what the reviews are about.  These guys are great.  I appreciate their service, as they set an example for other locations.  Glad I chose this one.  Maybe when times are busy you might have to wait, but they seem efficient and care about what they do.  Helena and Marrs were super.  Please keep them on the team.  They are valuable assets!< /text>

The counter agent, LT, was great. He was super efficient and very courteous. The car choices were good. I just wish they were open earlier and closed later, but it's a neighborhood location so their hours make sense. The car was a bit dirty when we picked it up, but LT offered to vacuum it. We were in a hurry so we took it as is. They offer pick up and drop off service which was really convenient. Definitely going to check their rates next time I rent a car.< /Text>

They closed the door in our face!!! When you get a confirmation email you get the address:
6498 East South Street
Lakewood, CA US 90713

"East" is a problem on their website.

Plug this in to Google maps and see where it takes you, it takes you 3 miles on the other side of South Street.
Nonetheless, that's not the worst part. When my wife and I realized the address was off, we called Hertz at 5:54 pm to notify them that we were just down the road, the woman on the phone said great, we have your car ready. I kid you not, I was at the door at 6:01 pm and they were inside ignoring me with the door locked. My wife drove to the back where they were running out of the store and said straight to my wife's face come back tomorrow, we open at 7. What kind of customer service is that? She said her name was Kay White, but who know if that was the truth. I am very upset right now considering this just happened within the hour.

Not even one star, I couldn't imagine treating another person that way....horrible.</text>

Renter BEWARE!!!. Read your contract prior to leaving. I was quoted a price for a four day rental; Upon my return ( 4 days later) I found that the price was actually for a three day rental. I was charged a late fee due to the paperwork I did not examine was for three as well. When making reservations ask for a proof email to verify what the actual agreement is for. ( They said all they needed was my name. ) Seeing you sign a screen and not paperwork any more be sure you view the rate and return time. This is how they got me. I signed and they tossed it in to an envelope and I ways on my way. The agent gave me a price for a three day to sway me from another company with a better four day deal. I should of gone with Alamo. If there was a score for less than one star I would post that. Be careful. I am not saying all Hertz locations are this way just be extra careful in Lakewood. Try the Long Beach Airport for safer options.<//Text>

Terrible. This is my second year renting with them. I made the reservation both years two months before. I get there last year and this year car is not ready needs to be washed I have to wait an hour this year they didn't have my car they wanted to give me another one for $20 more a day. Told them no that was their problem they gave me another car but once again after an hour had gone by they needed to go wash this one another hour waiting. I will never rent from them again<//Review>

Hertz is ok. They tend to have older cars at the local offices and newer cars at airport locations.  Sometimes their prices are not so competitive,  but their representatives are the nicest.< /review>

I don't write a review a lot, but they don't even know what they need to do for the customers including a manager "Deannah". I've booked online a full size sedan for better MPG and comfort because my wife and I wanted to travel for a long distance. I've even prepaid for a weekly rate to reserve it for sure, but when we got there they rented all cars to auto repair shops and only one car Buick SUV was left for us...."Free Upgrade for us???" That's what they told me; they didn't even want to know what I meant for BETTER MPG. I wouldn't not recommend this place; not even 1 star but a minus 5 stars. The office is so small, and it seems like less than 5 cars in the parking lot. I don't understand what 2 or 3 Employees are doing in that small office.

I've wasted more than $50 for gasoline because of a stupid Buick SUV and spent almost 2 hours to exchange it to Chevy Malibu at Las Vegas Hertz...you know what?  A check-in staff in Vegas told me that Buick SUV was a smaller one than the full size sedan I had reserved. This Lakewood office would better be shut down...<//Review>

Arrived to the rental car location, only one person working the counter.. Another customer came in after me and they got helped out and out the door quicker. We had to wait due to the car not being "ready" which made us wait another 30min. The employees were not much help and kept giving us estimated times. They finally said a car was ready, but had low tire pressure showing on the gauge and we had to wait yet again. Waited about an hour and a half just to get a rental car, not cool. Horrible location.<//Text>

Super simple - no problems.

I used my AAA discount and got an excellent rate. I went to pick it up and the car was a little dirty from all the rain we've been having; they offered to take it to the car wash and vacuum it out; that took like 15 - 20 min but they told me upfront that it would.

Note: There were a couple of customers there that didn't seem very happy (don't know why) so i had some doubts at first -  but I had no problems at all.

The car looked and ran great on our little 300 mile trip. Dropped it off after hours and used the drop box for the keys. There were no surprises or extra charges. They don't have a huge selection of cars but I expected that because it's a really small place.

I will definitely use this Hertz location again the next time i need to rent a car.< /Text>

<Text>The benefit of renting from a place like this location is that it is a lot cheaper than renting from an airport location. Beyond that, it's not the most enjoyable experience. Don't get me wrong, all you do here is pick up and drop off cars, I'm not sure what else people expect from a rental car agency. Our car that we rented recently, however, was full of the previous renter's stuff: Coffee mug, dog chew toy, pair of glasses. But, we were in and out in a relatively short time and were on our way without any hassle. I would return here in the future.</Text>< pics>

Extremely shady and nasty place, cars are in very poor condition and smell like tobacco/marijuana. NOT WORTH YOUR TIME

Update!!

The next morning of driving the vehicle, I was pulled over by the cops because of the EXPIRED Registration!!!! Thankfully the cop didn't give me a ticket, also the car's AC smelled really bad. When I went back to the Rental location, the manager told me they didn't know about the car's expired registration and he will get me in a different car and when we went outside where they have the cars I saw another 3 that the tags were expired. DONT COME HERE.

Long story short, I left without a car because bad customer service and cars are not good here.< /text>

<userid>103354750988190556979</userid><Text>Where do I start. We made a reservation and when we showed up they completely disregarded it. We waited over an hour to get a car that can only be described as damaged and filthy. There were no other cars available. Customer service is ok, but they only had 1 person working the counter and phones. Nobody else in sight. I will never... EVER... Rent from hertz again and am forwarding this info to my insurance company to hopefully get this location de-listed. Additionally, I have been calling over and over with no answer. They didn't inform me that there is no way to return the car after hours like a regular rental agency so I now have to take off work to return it.</Text></record></dataset><record>
<review>It is just ok. As a customer you need to pay attention to your bill, otherwise you will be overcharged</review><Gmap_id>0x80dd2d7ed6fec965:0x15e542d1d25c1a4b</Gmap_id><user>100177447102616962280< /user>< Name>

<Review>This music store had quite a bit of things. The place was fairly clean but it was a bit older. I also teach piano and guitar lessons here for $35 once a week for a half hour.  The employees that were working we’re very friendly and informative as well. Would I come here again probably not but that’s because I live far away and go to another music school.  I came here because I wanted to check out the keyboards.  I posted lots of pics of all the stuff they had.  Enjoy.<//Review>< Name>

<Rating>5< /Rating><time>1551818646757<//time><text>Was a good experience buying an acoustic guitar here. Jim was helpful with the selection and allowed me to play it with an amp to get a feel for its sound.

Price is decent. This baby fender is $299.99; it's beautiful and sounded great. It's the same price as most online stores, but I do like to support a local business instead. Plus, you get to hold the guitar and confirm its quality, not having to worry about the guitar breaking in half for an online shipment.</text><response>None</response><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOL51C8nwx7b6cPnOuIZOQkWBbHNnFSTYsHS_K1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< gmap_id>

<review>Have been taking piano lessons here for some time and it's nice to have a music store which carries sheet music and books as well as some instruments and basic live-sound gear. Also the staff is generally always friendly and helpful. In today's age of online shopping it is nice to still have a store like this locally available.</review>< pics>

This place is a Fremont institution, with a variety of instruments, gear, sheet music and equipment for all levels of musician from beginner to pro. I love that they have small, affordable musical 'toys' like shakers, harmonicas [they have pro stuff too!], fun-colored ukuleles and little things to interest kids in music! Excellent, helpful staff. You won't be disappointed by a visit to this great shop.< /Review>

<username>Howard Chong<//username><review>Great place for musical instruments. It looks like they have all of the band and classical string instruments that one can think of. They have a hundreds available for rent I was told. I rented a clarinet, can remember the brand, Yamaha was one of the 2 options. They had a nice adjustment of ukeleles.

If course, they do have music lessons also. Allegro is easy to find and established, hopefully to be around for decades more.</review>< Time>

Great and friendly atmosphere. Staff were very kind, helpful, patient, and informative. They listened closely to my needs and problem. Saw another customer get great customer service as he needed to try a variety of instruments. Got a free installation for some components on the violin! Left satisfied. Would recommend for musical needs!</text>

< Review>
The staff was very helpful and informative. He explained many things in detail and very thoughtful. The best service I have ever experienced so far. It is very rare nowadays to meet business providing great service. Most of companies need to train their employees in customer service because they are very lacking. However, this doesn't apply to Allegro Music. 1000 thumbs up for Allegro staff for his great customer service.</Review>

I'm pretty close to this place, since music is one of my passions. It's been around even before I was born, and my teacher's as well. It's what introduced me to learning guitar and later drumming, and the people there are chill enough to ask any question. Or just talk, I guess. Either way, definitely recommend coming if you need lessons or equipment.</Review>

I think this place is the best music shop in the Fremont area. We are renting a trombone and a trumpet for my kids' school bands, and had repeated accidents on the spit valve & spring on the trombone. They've fixed each accident very professionally WITHOUT charge. What more can you ask for from this neighborhood music store?<//Review>

<Review>As as a local music teacher I  have been doing business with Allegro Music for 24 years. The store is well stocked and what they do not have they will order.  I have  always found them to be friendly and extremely helpful with a very knowledgeable group of sales and instrument repair people.  It is so wonderful to have such a fine music store in town. Thank you for your years of service.</Review><name>Christy Hitson</name><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Few years back, my daughter took in her flute for repair.  The man saw the flute and said some very insensitive things about how one can own a "cheap" flute that was not meant to be refurbished.  My daughter came home crying. The flute was her 4th grade birthday present from me.< /Text>< Pics>

Friendly staff, good location, beautiful-sounding instruments, sheet music and accessories, moderate prices. A little cramped, but not egregiously. They do repairs and setups, too.</Text>

The milk tea there is fine. Honestly, I love milk tea. But they always messing up my order. No ice or too sweet. Once i got milk tea with my sister and we got the same tea. She said that it tasted funny. I tasted it and it had NO TEA. It was just milk and water with some boba in it.   I love milk tea but, I think I need to find a new place.< /text>

Got shlam! This place is BOMB! My family and I are boba milk tea connoisseur's. It's hard to come by places like this so don't waste your money somewhere else. Also this place is the only one I've found around here with actual tea in their taro drinks (my fiance's fave).< /Review>

<text>Never coming here again. Ordered a Winterfell with no ice and 50% sugar. Cup was about 1.5" empty at the top - - when I asked, they told me it was cuz I ordered no ice. They gave me a bs answer about the dispenser automatically dispensing portions. Every other boba tea place I've ever been to, still fills the cup to the top. And I've been to a good number of them, many in San Jose. If everyone else can fill the cup, surely they can find a way. Also, even at 50% sugar, drink was still too sweet. Also, there was a grittiness on top of the egg pudding. Never coming here again.

Very poor value and product for $6.< /text></record>

Delicious bubble tea! The taro bubble tea tastes like fruity pebbles and the melon smoothie bubble tea is amazing. They give you a good amount of boba and the employees are all really nice. The seating area is alright, not ideal if your not a fan of really low seats or if you're looking for seating with support. Overall, it is a cozy little shop. Personally, I recommend you grab and go. Don't forget to ask for a punch card!<//Text>

They have a great selection of teas and a knowledgeable, friendly staff. The place is a little small, but it feels cozy unless it's very crowded. I recommend passion fruit tea with cherry popping boba! Fun and delicious.< /Review>

For those in South County (Gilroy, Morgan Hill) it is hard to find a good place that serves boba drinks. Well look no further, Tealite Drinks and Snow is the best spot to get your boba drinks hands down!</Review>

Horrible service!!!! Very rude behavior especially the owner. I was one of her everyday costumers, and she always gave me bad attitude, no more lady. I'm done with your bad attitude, and I would never recommend her place to anyone anymore. If she does not care about her costumer's shame on her.< /text>

<review>Great place for small kids to come play. Each room has a different theme so the kids can play make believe in a fire station, class room, all the way to a kid sized gym. It didn't get too over crowded the one time I was there. Prices were reasonable for two kid's admission and the facility was decently clean especially due to the fact that kids play pretty rough here each day. Only suggestion would be the hours. Would be nice if they opened a little earlier then noon and stayed open on weekends. All and all, great place though for mom and kids to come play just to get out of the house.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I’ve been here TWICE and both times they were closed??? The first time a sign on the door, but they should post on the website, or at least their social media so parents don’t drive all the way there for them to be closed. I went again TODAY, and closed again. It’s supposed to be open play? Their own worker wasn’t even sure, and couldn’t contact the owner. Unprofessional. Was thinking of hosting my daughters birthday there, but don’t think I’ll be coming back at all🤷🏽‍♀️ There was also another family waiting as well to see if it would be open, because it was during open play hours.

EDIT: your site says suspended in DECEMBER. It is a Tuesday in January and I don’t see anything About MWF. Your website still say M-F 12-5 open play.</Text>

We love this place!! So many cool different themed room for the kids to play in. I have a 4 yr old and a 1 yr old and they both love it. Clean bathroom and a changing table. Also, there are tables and chairs in the back if your kids need a snack break. The Staff is great!! Don’t forget your socks!<//text>

3.5 🌟 We walked in and were greeted with a smile. The location was bright, clean and spacey. The kids had a blast playing make-believe. There were a few toys that were not functional or had no batteries. There is a play room that has a military boot camp theme. My issue, as a veteran is that they are only flying  4 of 5 military flags. Imagine Me Grow is a must do location for the kids.< /text>

Perfect for the 3-year olds we hosted for a party there. They played non-stop. And I was happy because it is very clean and safe. And the party options are great...you can pick and choose options to fit your budget and level of personal contribution. My son also loved the open play times. Overall I would recommend this place to ANYONE. Happy to have a place like this in the area.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>My 2 kids had a blast at this place!  My boy is 4.5 and my daughter is 3 and they both don't stop moving while they're here.  It is constant stimulation play interchanged with real life experiences.  It's a perfect indoor play place for children ages 2 and up!  Great for parties and gatherings!!  We held a painting party here over the summer and had plenty of room while others played in the facility without being bothered by our party.  Wonderful and accommodating staff who are always attentive and prepared.  Great job guys!  This is a "must have" for kids in the Murrieta/Temecula area!</Text><userid>116719418769909125706</userid>< Rate>

Hands down the best place to throw a kid party!

Our 5-year-old loves open play at this place. So naturally we knew Imagine Me Grow would be the perfect place to throw our youngest daughter's 1st birthday party. And boy were we right! It was completely stress-free and there was no mess to clean up afterwards.

We were allowed to bring in our own food/decorations; however, you can also purchase them through Imagine Me Grow. But regardless, the staff, which by the way, were the sweetest, helped set up our party decor and food/dessert stations. Oh, and they even took photos as well!

Also, most kid party centers do not allow you to bring in your own food so this was a major plus for us as our oldest has a couple severe food allergies.

But the best part of it all was that all of our guests had an amazing time. Everyone kept complimenting how fun and cute the place was. Some even mentioned they'd like to throw their next kids birthday party there.<//Review>

Fantastic place for kids birthday party!! My review is long overdue, as my son's party was almost two years ago, right after they opened. The owners were very accommodating and could not have been nicer. Last year for our son's party we tried something new but, I would love to go back this year to Imagine Me Grow.</Text>

We had a 10month old baby and they charged us. He didn't even play. So for 4 kids it was 30 and the place isn't very big. Better off just doing it as a birthday party not for Open play.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><username>Heather Santiago< /username>< Resp>

My children love coming to Imagine Me Grow because they can do just that...Imagine! They can be a fireman, a DJ, a chef, or whatever their hearts desire. It is a very bright and clean place, which is important for me as a parent. Definitely will be taking my children here more often!</Text>

<review>I had a lovely time celebrating my youngest 1st birthday at Imagine Me Grow. All the kids at the party had a blast!!! My private event was PRIVATE and i loved it!!!! The only thing that wasn't it for me but the kids loved it was the kids pop lol the host and I joked about the music so many times. The host was also amazing, really sweet young woman. May be hosting another event soon.<//review><Time>1481940445015< /Time><name>Tishawnna Coleman< /name><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

Nice place for the kids to play.
Was hardly anyone there when we went. They are only open a short time during the day. By the looks of the sign in sheet only 6 people had been there all day.
Honestly I don't know how they pay the rent, must be some kinda money laundering operation....<//review>

<Review>Wonderful fun play stations! We attended a birthday party here today for a classmate of my son. 4/5 year olds and their siblings were welcomed and allowed to play and explore. It reminded me of a  children's pottery barn catalog brought to life! Very sweet moments as my son and friends served one another in the bakery and sea food restaurant. My younger two loved the fire station very much. The cars can be pushed around the road and this was a please t surprise. The dance room was often empty but once in a while the children would enter and burst into dance. It was fun! Each room has a small screen tv with the rooms topic playing on the screen. At first I felt this was unecessary but as the party progressed it made sense, and had no sound so it wasn't intrusive to their imaginative play.

A music room would be fun, but trust me the kids were very satisfied and the play kitchens, fire station and dance room seemed to be my three boys favorite.

If I had to give any critique it would be to share that it is not a tactile/sensory experience as it is very clean and free of any sand or water play. That is understandable as it accomadates cooperative play amongst many children, young children. The environment fostered cooperative play and surprisingly allowed children the freedom to cooperate and play individually. I highly recommend!

In a time where children play centers resemble casinos and bars, and are often filled with video games this was refreshing!

Created for the younger child I find it sweet that they are not bombarded with flashing lights and bribery of candy and cheap toys. If my older kids were with me I could see them getting a little "bored" but I would encourage them to play and pretend with their younger siblings and I know the entire family would be better for it! So often we spend time and money to celebrate our children but we end up just consuming and teaching them greed and consuming. This truly fosters imaginative play that will help families bond, social skills flourish and develop life long memories.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Time>1457745779244<//Time>< name>

I am extremely happy with the customer service, cleanliness and property management at Self Storage of Vacaville. From the first phone call to inquire about storage options to the day I arrived with a full moving van, they were professional and friendly and assisted me with securing a climate controlled unit for long term storage. I feel confident in the security of my belongings and highly recommend this as an option for anyone who needs a storage facility!< /text>

I have now had my storage a couple of months and still doing fantastic. They were very considerate and worked w/me setting up a different account that they could have charged late fees for, but they did not. This is a huge factor and a definite 5 star rating!!< /Text>< pictures>

OMG......Michelle went above and beyond my expectations. She was a kick. She took me on a tour of available units and helped me through the whole process. She knows everyone of her customers. They have like a 1000 storage units!!! The office had water, cookies and candy for the guests. The unit was clean and I am very happy I decided to go with Self Storage of Vacaville. Thanks again....</Review>

We drove by this place often, but we expected it to be really expensive because it's fairly new.  That is not the case!  There cost is very competitive, and I love that they keep their facility clean.  The staff is exceptional!  Matthew, Michelle and Jo are very welcoming and friendly.

My utmost respect for the high caliber customer service from day one on the telephone to my in-store visit. Feeling stressed over the coordination of my pods into your facility , all of you made it seamless. From the accommodating attitude to the personal conversations - you made the move fun.  The weather was 90+ on some days and I want to thank you so much for the cold water.  Hats off to all of you and your Mr. & Ms. mini carts.<//review>< gmapID>

<text>Staff are very friendly, down to earth and pleasant to talk to.  The process was quick and easy to understand.  Your "Special Promo" is what sold me on using Self Storage of Vacaville.  It worked for the timeframe I needed, and the units indoor was an option I never knew I had.  I also like that there is only one path to follow to find my unit, no maze.  I am extremely happy with Self Storage of Vacaville.  I would recommend this Storage Facility to everyone! It's a brand new building with lots of storage units still available!

Our son found Self Storage of Vacaville, met Michelle, toured the facility and called to say how impressed he was.  Michelle found us two large climate controlled units adjacent to each other.  They worked with us long distance, and when the moving truck arrived coordinated the unloading of our possessions into the two units.  When we arrived, we too were impressed with the beautiful facility, but even more with the superb service.  Thanks!</text>< Pictures>

I love this place! I moved my things into storage about a month ago. I was leaving my old home waiting to move into our new home and Michelle made it so easy to get a unit and make the best suggestion with all the things I have. It’s always clean and they’re more than accommodating. I’m here today because of course I lost my key and left my only spares in the unit. 🤦🏽‍♀️  Definitely recommend it to anyone looking to safely store there things for a short or long period of time</text>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>VERY happy with Self Storage of Vacaville.  From the moment I made my first call to Self Storage of Vacaville to present I have been extremely pleased with the professional service provided by the staff.  They are friendly and helpful.  The units are clean, I love that the lights come on as I make my way through the halls and the special added touch of music playing lightly in the background.  Self Storage of Vacaville also provides rolling carts at the entrance of each building which makes moving items from car to unit pretty effortless.  They provided me with a lock of choice for my unit, an offer to use a Uhaul if needed and as a new business their sign up special offering is great.

I used a different storage company a couple of years ago for a few months, I constantly had problems with the auto pay and I didn't like that the gates were not accessible after the office closed which included holidays.  So far my experience at Vacaville Self Storage has far exceeded my expectations.<//review></record></dataset><record>

This storage facility is super clean and the staff is incredibly friendly/helpful. Cleanliness was a priority for me when I was choosing where I wanted to store my belongings. As soon as I walked in I was amazed at how new and fresh they keep their grounds looking.<//text>

I have an awesome experience with this newly opened self-storage facility on Leisure Town Road. This beautiful and clean facility has the state of the art design and technology such as password-enabled security gates and security cameras. You got to check it out!

The manager and staff are top-notch. They know the facility operations from top to bottom. But most of all, they treat you as a family. They assisted me all the way during the rental process. They always greeted with a smile every time I check my stuff in the storage.

Also, the facility has everything I need for storage needs - moving supplies and locks. Why need to go to another store when I have everything I need in this facility.

Self Storage of Vacaville is a great facility. I highly recommend it for your storage needs!</text>

I met Jo (manager) this morning and she was super sweet and very helpful with opening the gate to allow my movers through. This place is super clean, nice and full of helpful people that are here to help make your move/transition as smooth as possible! Not to mention they offer a military discount!!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Absolutely amazing staff.  They are always keeping a close eye on my units.  I accidentally not locked my unit correctly once and was notified immediately.
The owners of this storage facility are extremely Community oriented and provide so much help to all who need help.  The amazing efforts they have made to help those affected  by the recent fires in California is above and beyond what most businesses would do.
Thank you Self Storage of Vacaville.  You have a lifelong customer and supporter!!!!</review>

This place looks small from the street (not the case at all!) so it took me some time of driving by to actually stop in and see what they have to offer.
Now that I'm a customer I wish I would've came so much sooner.
Staff is AWESOME very friendly and helpful! Didn't make us feel stupid or that we were wasting their time by asking questions and trying to figure out what size unit fits our needs.
Can't wait for a dump station and wash area for campers then I will bring that over here also.
Again a clean facility and a staff that makes you feel comfortable and is very helpful.< /Text>

If I could rate this location with more stars I would.  Such great staff, friendly, helpful, and the units are clean and have state-of-the-art protection systems built in.  When you open your door, and LED light comes on so you can see inside your unit.  Each unit is visible in a security camera system monitored 24/7.  Each unit has a break detector so if someone breaks in, security is notified immediately.  Every one that gains access to the facility has to type in a code and is catalogued.  They even have personal that live onsite for added security!  All-in-all, you couldn't ask for a better storage unit!<//text>

We didn't have to look very far because the staff and owners at Self Storage of Vacaville listened to our story and helped us out immensely by giving us a payment of 0 for 6 months. The owners and the staff of this establishment have enormous hearts and we greatly appreciate the enormous gift they have given us! The grounds and storage units are brand new and very well maintained! I will be telling all my friends and family what they  have done for our family for years to come. on behalf of my family I want to say thank you for the awesome experience.

<review>Oh my gosh!! I don’t know if I have the right words to describe our experience at Self Service of Vacaville! This place is simply AMAZING!! Everything about this place from the cleanliness, to the state of the art security system, to the automatic lights and music in the hallways!! And heck, I haven’t even gotten to the service yet! When I called, I spoke with Michelle. She was so kind and patient on the phone with me. You would think that’s supposed to be normal but not so much nowadays. She answered all my questions and then offered more information that I didn’t even think of to ask. Then when we got there, we dealt with Matthew. Holy moly, could he have been anymore patient and accommodating?! So easy to work with!and just a great guy. We’re a small nonprofit and every little penny helps! So what did Matt do? He called his manager Jo, to help us out. And you know what, they did!!! As far as managers go, Jo and Lindsey take the cake! I have to say, if you need to store anything, you would be silly not to check with them FIRST!! Incredible service and great staff!! Plus, they have awesome discounts but really go for some good ol’ fashion customer service because you don’t get it like that too much anymore.</review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1572453514875, 'text': 'Hi Alexis,  We are so pleased you are happy with the services we offer.

<Review>This place is awesome. It’s a mom and pops place, and lady and her husband who run it are very friendly and charming. I’m from the east coast and this place most resembles the east coast Chinese restaurants to me, from the food to the decor. She clearly cooks the food to order, so it’s fresh! She can be seen grabbing the ingredients after order. The food always comes out super fast (15 minutes tops) after order. This is my Chinese carry out of choice for sure, and much better than most others I’ve tried. Only downside is it’s much more pricey than Chinese on the east coast, but this is Southern California after all</Review>< gmap_id>

Great customer service 5/5. But the food was dry and lacked flavor. I would recommend giving it a try, your experience may be different.</text>

<user_name>Leanne Laforge<//user_name><text>This is one of the best Chinese restaurants around period. The owners are sweet and friendly.  The food is always fresh and delicious.  The TaiChen Chicken is my favorite dish. The egg drop soup is FANTASTIC and a must when you're sick. I swear by it. The sweet and sour sauce is the best I've ever had.  Also the prices are competitive and decent for the amount of food you get. I highly recommend so many of the dishes served here. Mongolian beef, Pork fried rice, dumplings, egg rolls, ..... all yummy.<//text><date>1597533635243</date><user>116812796963212615757<//user>< pics>

There fried rice sucks and there was barely any shrimp. My kids will eat almost anything but they made this a dare and couldn't complete it. There shrimp with lobster sauce was bad. I love Chinese food, authentic and American. I have eaten at so many Chinese food places that I've lost count. But only 13 have seriously gotten a bad review from me. I don't even mind the look of the place because if the food is good then who cares. But the food was awful. Never again will I return to this place.</text><Rate>1< /Rate><time>1495051535029</time>< userid>

<Review>This place is my number one restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to visit this restaurant. Whenever  I I need a special dinner, this restaurant comes first to my head. very good and   food and a rich menu.generous crew, and good spirit. And very important, the price is decent. I sent my friends to this restaurant with no hesitation.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

My husband and I went here 2 years ago when we first started dating while looking for a good Chinese place which seems to be impossible here in SoCal. We fell absolutely in love with this place. The couple that runs this place are so incredibly nice and make it very enjoyable to be here. The food is amazing, all the meat seems to just melt in your mouth, there’s lots to choose from, and the prices are great compared to a lot of Chinese places around here.< /Text>

<review>New to the area, so wanted to find the best local places to eat and treat friends to when they visit. This is a small restaurant, but I find those are the best. Great China didn't  disappoint.  The tables were clean and the place was well lit. Nancy, one of the owners, was pleasant and served our drinks quickly and gave us the time we needed to go over their large menu. The food was brought to the table quickly and hot. All the food we ordered was exactly as promised. Good portions, great tasting,  fair prices.  I found Great China to be a place I would recommend to anyone.< /review>< Pics>

Confirmed when husbands chicken was the same way.  But other than that,  you could not taste it.  Noodles were excellent.  Rangoon's were well done as well.

My wife and I take out from the Great China whenever we are in the mood for Chinese food. Their sesame, kung pao, and sweet & sour chicken all all really good. My wife enjoys the shrimp dishes (mostly goes for the moo goo shrimp).

Strangely, we have never gone there to dine in.</review>

There is regularly a large group of men loitering outside nearby 5 - 10 adult men just standing around. And they are noisy. Its intimidating for a single woman. Otherwise the food here is not great. Everything tastes the same and has way too much sugar and celery in it.</review>

This hole in the wall Chinese food place is pretty good. If you're not picky about your chicken pieces their orange chicken is flavored perfectly everytime.... if I ever have an itch for Chinese in Fallbrook this is definitely the place to go.... fair pricing and the woman is always SO nice. The food quality has always been very fresh and cooked properly... love this place!<//review>

The food is alright here.  A bit expensive for the amount of food that we ordered.  $27.00~ for 2 entrees and an extra rice.  I would rather spend the money at panda express and get more for my money to include flavor.  Not a fan of the beef and broccoli, it was over saturated with soy sauce.  Try it once and make your own decision is my recommendation to you.</Text>

I read the reviews but had to find out for myself.  I ordered take out.  I ordered the pupu platter of appetisers...nothing good there, hot and sour soup....tasted okay but smells funny, beef noodles....oily and lack of flavor.  It's not that the food is bad it's just not good.  I would have rather stayed home and ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  We threw everything away after tasting it. Forgot to ask if they use MSG.  Now just wait and see how everything comes out.< /Text>

This was my first time to a Chinese establishment in San Diego; in Fallbrook no less. My fiancé and I had a very unique experience here that suited the nature of this town very well.
The first thing we noticed is that the atmosphere and ambiance seemed truly authentic. It's almost like a hole-in-the-wall Chinese spot, but with finesse. The decor was traditional, the seating was cozy and the music was exactly what I'd expect in an authentic Asian location. The feel was very warm and welcoming.
We were greeted very friendly and with open-arms from an older lady (who appeared to be the owner), who was all-smiles and had a deep Asian accent. We then noticed it was only her and possible a cook in the back. This led to the true, authentic feeling of a "mom and pop" restaurant. Loved it!! I don't like "chain" food establishments.
With all this in mind, please be aware that your food is 'made-to-order' and takes its time to be prepared; so sit-back and read the papers or enjoy your conversation.
Now for the food. We ordered the Pu-Pu Platter, soup, a rice bowl and veggie pan-friend noodles.
The portions here are 'human-sized' and not the typical "American Super-Sized" kind.
My teriyaki chicken rice bowl suited me perfectly and the appetizers came in 2 piece samples. I wasn't used to how they prepared the pan-fried noodles and they weren't exactly "crispy" or slightly burned like I've had before; but I'm sure that's just their way of doing the dish. I'll go back next time and order something simple and use that as my basis.
All-in-all, I liked my dining experience here in this quaint, authentic restaurant.

Side Note: I wasn't immediately hungry when I got home and that leads me to believe they don't use MSG in their cooking. Yay!!!</Text>

We love the beef lo mein noodles, kung pao...both beef and chicken, garlic chicken, hon hon shrimp, general gou chicken, sesame beef....the list goes on. We have loved every dish we have eaten from the Great China Restaurant, whether we have ordered take-out or dined in. We have actually traveled several miles just to try different restaurants, and let me tell you, the best one so far has been in our little town of Fallbrook. Food is great, service is excellent and friendly, and it is family owned and operated. Highly recommended!!!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

If you're on your way to Florence Blvd and you hit that curve on the right hand side, and you have a flat or need air, or even a tire, and the best mechanic advice you'll spent top dollar somewhere else, go here instead.  The nicest people you'll ever meet, and very generous and willing to help you in your needs.  I recommend this place with more than 5 stars. They will patch your tire as well. Please give them your community support. Love, love, love, this place.</text>

What can it say. It's a Tire Shop. Oh wait. They do some auto repairs. Honest guys, Alex, and Ernie. If they can't do it, they don't try. Not just trying to make a buck. I trust them. Thanks Guys..</Review>

Good men! They've saved me and my company for years. They are beyond reliable and more than anything they want to make sure that you feel safe on the road at an affordable price. Alex and Ernesto are the captains of the ship and they make sure that you feel like family.<//text>

<text>Dependable, affordable & no over charge.  Ad a woman I'm always on the look out for a machanic that will not over charge etc because I'm a woman.  Which is why I make this my 1 stop for over 10 years.  They do more then tires.  I'm getting my radiator fixed right now & I know I can depend on them doing it right.  I've also had my window fixed etc.</text></record></dataset><record>

They get the job done thoroughly & inexpensively! Alex, Ernesto, & Alejandro are awesome and possess great automotive expertise. My entire family frequents this establishment and our cars span the gamut from Honda to Infiniti to Jeep.< /Text>

Prior to finding United Tires I was getting ripped off by all sorts of mechanics, things such as being overcharged, fixing things that didn't need fixing (you get the idea) When I came to United Tires I really thought these guys are too good to be true. My wife and I own 2 Honda Accords and 1 Ford Ranger and prior to that have owned other Honda's as we are a Honda family.

Alex, Ernesto and Alejandro are some of the coolest guys you want to meet. They treat you with respect and are very knowledgeable in what they do. My wife has had a complete overhaul on her 91 Accord (Great job guys). We also get our new brake pads, radiators, tires khumo , tune ups.....ect.

As I am writing this review I have my 02 Accord presently at their shop being worked on and I have complete trust in these guys and that's hard to find now days. I referred my old neighbor and he's still a happy customer to this day.

I'm not one for writing reviews only when it comes to my Jordan's but I have been with United Tires for around 5 or 6 years  and these guys work hard at what they do and they have earned this review through good customer service, work ethics and most of all integrity.

Plus their prices fit my budget! Couldn't ask for more. Keep up the good work guys and as long as United Tires is around and I have a car I'll keep coming back.

God Bless..............!

E. Strong...............!<//text>

<Review>This place is pretty great and has been in Tracy for a very long time. its exactly what you expect. the people complaining in the reviews really need to realize what they are getting lol. this place has good cheap pizza at the price of everything else. the pizza is still good but getting upset about wait time or how it end up at a place that has been UNDERSTAFFED for over a decade is nothing to complain about. the food tastes good and we cant really complain.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Date>

< Review>
we pick up a pizza and come home pizza was not cut. Whole large pizza 4 slices. They do not make sure by open box to see if pizza has been cut so if someone took home they believe they eat the pizza as one big WHOLE slice or 4 slices for large. Dissaproval. Two thumb down.</Review>

< Review>
Went in, placed an order at 6:50, I was told the wait would be 20 minutes. I came back in at 7:10, pizza still wasn't ready. I gave my name and was told the wait would be 6 minutes more.
I sit down, and after trying to be patient and letting them handle the line, I finally get up and ask about my pizza. By this time it was 7:40, nearly an hour after ordering. After again giving my name, I'm told I need to show my receipt, which clearly means they have lost track of my order.
Without saying any apologies or even giving me any words at all, the employee goes to the back, leaving me to wait for several minutes without knowing what was going on. I could hear people arguing in the back over an order placed an hour ago, clearly mine.
Finally, a different person comes out and hands me a pizza. There were no apologies, no attempts to reconcile the mistakes at all.
Terrible customer service, absolutely no sense of urgency, and employees who were indifferent and had zero enthusiasm or friendliness.< /Review>

I placed an order at 6pm online. I get there at 630 (order said it would be ready at 620) pizza isn't available. I asked for an update. I was told 10 minutes, that they were just waiting on one of the pizzas. I figured whatever, 40 minutes later, still no pizza. I even talked to the manager, she disappeared to the back. My pizza finally came out - 1 hour and 20 minutes post ordering. I don't mind having to wait, I fully understand that Friday night rush happens. But the way, that they were taking care of the customers that have been waiting for over an hour was completely unprofessional. No recourse and barely even a sorry that they were busy.<//Text>

<text>Friendly staff and quick service.  The manager there is always courteous and goes out of his way to greet us every time we go in. The store is always clean and the staff is quick and courteous. It is a little difficult to get in and out of the parking lot though. We typically choose Little Caesars for pizza because of the quick and courteous customer service.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80903d17c7c30c25:0x627e8140d99b715d< /gmapID></record>

After almost 30 minutes my pizza was finally ready. Many people were in the store and ordered after me, yet got their food long before I did. And on top of that, someone who ordered about 2 people after me sent their child to ask if their pizza was ready, taking a pizza that was likely mine, while I had been waiting for about 20 mins. Because they arent going to say no to a child. Not very "hot n ready" I hope my next experience will be better if I decide to go back. The only good thing is that the pizza was hot.<//Review>< date>

They said it would take roughly 20 mins. Simple enough right? Wrong. Upon my return, i ask if my order is ready and about a minute later some woman comes over with what she said was stuffed crust and crazy bread but called the wrong name and therefor the wrong person came to pick it up. In the midst of this I mention the fact that that she called my exact order and yet she gave it away to another customer. So, not only was my experience ruined but I’m sure the other customer’s experience. And after the matter, when I ask for a refund, the manager doesn’t bother to apologize. Overall a horrible experience and I will never go there again — nor should you.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Great place when they're not busy. When they are busy - forget it. Obviously, Tracy needs a second location? Or maybe just more staffing/better planning at this location when they are busy?</Text>

Food here's good, love the remodel 💁 but I feel it needs a bigger waiting area or at least one more person at the registers to get the line moving. Customers are getting angry too fast because of it. Bless the people that work here 💀 I'm sure it's stressful</review>

Thought she said 3-5 minutes but ended up being 35 for a extra most bestest and an additional 15 minutes for my friends cheese bread. Food was good but way too long for hot and ready</text>

I placed my order through the portal app, got notification that it was ready.  I went to pick it up and apparently they lost my order. Had to wait 15 minutes more. This isn't the first time it's happened either. I'm sorry to say the young cashiers there are really incompetent and/or not properly trained</review>

It's not hot and ready. Just order through the phone. It's about a 30 minute wait. Never go to little ceasers without ordering through the phone. As long as you get that mind set than it's still good pizza for the price. Just don't walk in, your looking at a 45 minute wait everytime< /review>

Came in on a saturday night around 745. There were 2 people ahead of me one of them complained no one was answering the phone. Girl at the counter was extremely RUDE and unprofessional. Never said hi or nothing absolutely no greeting just a very smug "what can i get you" i watched her toss the guys pizzas on the counter before me. She was absolutely RUDE AND UNPLEASANT. Besides the HORRIBLE customer service i got exactly what i ordered and was very pleased with my food. Please either retrain your employee or hire someone with some decent people skills.<//text>

<Review>The deep dish pizza is pretty good and very inexpensive. If you're looking for "the very best pizza" keep looking. If you want something that won't break the budget, is fairly good, and has pizza made and ready to go, this is the spot.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

The worst customer service, taking so long. Only one person working at cash register, 10 people working in the back they do nothing. Very long line. If u want to order just cheese pizza, you have to wait about 30 minuets for that. I don’t think they have store manager.< /Text>

<Text>Called 3 times between 9 and 9:15 without them answering. Drove 20 minutes to get there knowing they are supposed to close at 10. Got there at about 9:38 And the worker was locking the door. I knocked on the door before she got to the door to go to the back and she ignored me and walked into the back and shut that door. I could see if it was after 950 but this was bad business and I won't be going back to this little ceasars. Horrible service.<//Text><userid>102324396250556415529</userid>< gmap_id>

Once upon a time this place was great, but the place has just went down hill in the past year. They NEVER have deep dish or cheesy bread anymore...three times in the past 2 weeks they have ran out by 6pm...2 weeks ago I tried to call to place an order for an hour=no answer it just rang and rang and rang. When I finally drove down there and made sure I had the right number, the girl blew it off when I told her. I got angry and said don't you think you should check on that...then I called the number and watched as they deliberately let the phone ring! What kind of pizza place has this place become. They even took out the bench so there is no seating to wait; because you will wait no matter what you order-NO hot and ready pizzas ever it seems like! After today, I am done with this place...I will go elsewhere for my pizza!< /review>

Good: Cheap decent pizza.
Bad: 1) Parking is terrible. Take a 2nd person to run in while you wait for parking or double park. 2) There is almost never anything hot and ready. 3) They are under staffed most of the time and it shows. 4) People who order over the phone still have to wait in the order line apparently while their pizza is getting cold. 5) Quality has gone down recently and the deep dish for example is not much thicker than the regular pizza.
I wish they would open up a 2nd shop somewhere that way they won't have to sacrifice service and quality for quantity.</review>

I like the new thin crust pepperoni pizza. Only downside is that the place is so busy and the parking lot is often crowded.</review>

The food is the same as any little Caesar and the staff is ok, they do their job. The only terrible thing is the parking, there's only one entrance and when it's busy it's HELL trying to get in and out. If it's busy park next door and walk over its a lot faster. Also bring an ID they check if your using any kind of card.<//review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>If I could give them a zero I would. I went in for a pepperoni pizza and breadsticks...items that are suppose to be ready to go. They were out of everything. The gal told me 5-10 minutes. I paid with credit card at 7:09 PM. I finally got my food at 7:47 PM. Do the math. 38 minutes for cheap pizza. I went there because I was in a hurry. Of course they have your money so your kinda stuck. When I mentioned to the gal how long it took despite her 5-10 minute quote, she literally shrugged her shoulders and gave a me that look of "oh well". If that were my child, she would have been slapped for such disrespect. And this is their "customer service?" I felt really bad for the lady ahead of me who had two young children. Same situation.

<Text>My wife called in our pizza at 6 we got there at 6:10 are Pizza sat there till 7 and never told us that our pizza was ready by the time they gave us our pizza it was cold they didn't offer any apology or didn't offer anything like maybe a free soda for what they did didn't offer nothing didn't apologize and we sat there for almost an hour with our pizza already ready and nobody notified us till we got up and said is our pizza ready or not and they go oh it's right here sitting there for an hour staring at us the worst service out of all the Little Caesars we've ever had is the one on Tracy on 11th< /Text>< user>

<username>Martha Huerta<//username><review>This was my first time at this place and I LOVED IT! great food, menu, service and cleanliness of the place. Staff super friendly, knowledgeable and on top of the service without being annoying.
Location is convenient, great atmosphere and food presentation was really good.
I definitely will come back since i want to try the different options there!</review>< gmap_id>

<Text>Berry, Spinach and Shrimp Quinoa Salad, French Dip, and Roasted Turkey Club on Sourdough were the bill of fare. With masking and social distancing being continued, it was not crowded at all. Kim was our server. She made sure our beverages were full, and stopped by the table several times. The food was very good. Recommend this location.</Text><gmapID>0x80d9553cc9b02c99:0xb9f2b04ca3b9c6d6</gmapID><userid>106592103822067608144</userid></record>

Nice and cozy place. Food is tasty and beautiful served. Waitress Tonya is very friendly. She was reading our mind 3 times! Impressive. Moreover,they gave us the biggest military discount we’ve ever got. (20%) I recommend this place.<//text>

What a wonderful restaurant! In the past year we have been here 10 plus times with friends and family. The restaurant is always clean, the staff is great and the food is loved by the whole family. They always have specials on drink and muffins which is great since there muffins are the best! Mimi's also loves there active military and veterans which is nice to see.

The downside is the parking can be very tight and crowded since the parking lot is small.</Text>

<Text>This place looked cute and had good reviews, but I felt very underwhelmed , I ordered the Sunny Side up eggs and they came RAW, meaning the white of the egg was still undercooked, the food in general looks good but everything was cold, from the soup to the susages to the waffle

The waiter Diego was amazing, prompt to get new eggs, fast service and nice.

I wouldn’t really recommend this place when there are so many good ones around.</Text>< gmap_id>

Enjoyed a lovely breakfast with my friend.  I had the eggs benedict...the hollandaise had a nice little citrus flavor and took home a carrot muffin...my favorite!</text>

I absolutely love this place. The food is tasty. And they serve breakfast all day. But the eggs benedict is only served til 2pm.

On this trip I ordered their brioche cheeseburger. It was so delicious. It had everything an american cheeseburger should have.

I didn't happen to take a picture of it but I did happen to take a picture of their creme brulee. It was heaven.

To top it all off our waitress Tonya was excellent. She was so sweet, funny and very attentive.< /review>

Our server Tonya was the best we've had in awhile. Energetic, friendly, funny and professional in every way possible. If your reading this try the pot roast...the best I've had and don't forget to ask for seating in Tonya's area.</text>

<review>Big chain that's still kicking around. Used to love going to Mimi's as a kid. It's still good, and still charming. The food is alright, nothing too amazing. But consistent and still good for a nice meal. The service is friendly, but also the general vibe is sort of glum. Good prices on wine though 😉<//review>< Pictures>

Although the manager did her best to rectify her staff's mistakes the service was below subpar. Using a holiday as an excuse for the poor service is inexcusable even in these difficult times. The food was lackluster, and bland. It was not the restaurant that I remember it being and would not return here. To the staff that did their part I do appreciate their service.< /Review>

Great service but food was subpar, very basic.Pretty disappointing esspecially for the price, but maybe it was what we ordered.I ordered Brisket Benedict, no brisket basically just potatoes and my man ordered the burrito. Mimosas were pretty good with $5 deal.< /review>

Nice atmosphere. Friendly wait staff. Good food! Their version of Mimosa was basically just OJ and I am a lightweight.  Would love a vegan muffin and/or desert option.  This is California after all! Good portion sizes! Really want to try their pumpkin latte when I have dairy again!< /review>

<review>I absolutely love this place. The food is tasty. And they serve breakfast all day. But the eggs benedict is only served til 2pm.

On this trip I ordered their brioche cheeseburger. It was so delicious. It had everything an american cheeseburger should have.

I didn't happen to take a picture of it but I did happen to take a picture of their creme brulee. It was heaven.

To top it all off our waitress Tonya was excellent. She was so sweet, funny and very attentive.<//review>< user>

The food was good. The ladies restroom needs attention, some maintenance would improve it.  The service was fine.  The parking was a bit of a challenge, the lot was full when we arrived, we drove around the parking lot twice, and caught someone as they were leaving.< /Review>

This is a great location to grab breakfast and coffee! I love that they are open early because I can get my morning meetings cranked out at a nice spot! I've visited a number of locations for breakfast in Mission Valley and this is certainly one of the top options.
I also regularly use their breakout room for weekly meetings and our server Diego takes excellent care of us- not only does he keep track of everyone's regular order, he'll commonly have our coffee or water waiting for us. The service is great.</Text>< name>

<Text>great staff, friendly and attentative 5 stars to the staff, ok.... food.......where do i start, visually most of the food looked amazing! good color in most of the food. my steak.... well it looked like it was cooked and all they did was put on the grill "mark maker" to give the look that it was grilled. my steak was missing lots of color and color is flavor! mine..... had none! now i know why the waiter asked if i wanted salt and pepper. my guess is that they know their food has no flavor. i asked my family about their food and they also had the same problem. bland and flavorless. i had a desert and my desert was ice cold, they caramelized the sugar and that is it. the best food was the mimosas! we all agreed that was great! 5 stars for staff, 1 star for food, total i cant give more than 2 stars. i was even told by my family that all my food was better. sorry Mimis, the flavor has to be there and please season your food!!</Text></record>

We've been going for over 15 years. Always great service, and food. The Burgers and Salmon are great. So are the Soups. Prices are good especially if you sign up for the Mimi's rewards. Great during holidays and events.<//Review>

Very nice and clean place. The food was served quickly and was steaming still. Great taste and the portions seems alright for the price. I order the French pot roast and it was delicious. The pot roast was tender and the mashed potatoes were warm and melt in your mouth. The carrots, celery and onions definitely gave it such a home cooked meal feel to this dish.<//text>

This was my second time at this location, and I have been to the Santee and Oceanside locations a few times..
This particular visit was fantastic. Our waitress was very quick with the service, and to make it even better, the food was served beautifully and bountifully portioned. I have the membership, which is free, and receive frequent buy one get one free coupons emailed to me. It's such an awesome deal and it makes it better that the food is so good. The only downside is that like with all restaurants, you can occasionally get worse than average service and that is frequently the problem with the Santee location. This Mission Valley location is highly recommended. They were packed but still had everything available to us with impeccable timing. Just wonderful overall.< /Text>

I came for lunch happy hour. I wanted to sit in Bar area. No problem. Asked for Kahlua Coffee, no problem. Ordered Mimi's meatloaf. Perfect! I had potatoes Augustine and garlic spinach. Portions "just right!" Loved female bartender who pampered me. Being a Senior female, alone I didn't feel alone! Thank you!🎶< /text>

The restaurant is cozy and charming. I ordered the salmon omelette, which was delicious! The hostess and server were very friendly. There was a short wait to be seated and for the food to arrive but it was fairly busy. The parking lot is a challenge, the parking spots are small and the lot was almost full when I arrived. You might want to call for reservations and ride share if you are going as a group. Highly recommended for a cozy little brunch date.</Review>

My wife and I decided to give this place another try and it has gotten way better. The price difference is still $3 for substituting shrimp but they actually have us 10 pieces. That is way better than $1 for 1 shrimp.
The 2 people I never saw before were way nicer than the previous people and our waiter Diego had some fun jokes and was on top of everything and way nice.

I had the ham and cheese crepe and it was amazing, and my wife had the chicken and mushroom pasta substitute shrimp.
If this location keeps these kind of employees and prices around then I will definitely come every week.</text>

This is a lovely place to eat, with attractive menus. I dont know if they are remodeling or what but there used to be an amazing art decor. It's just white and wood now.< /text>

I have been here a few times over the last three years. I like to go here for more special occasions because of the chic decor, excellent menu, and wonderful service. It's a guaranteed good experience. As a chain, it is still quality. It's ok to be casual or dressy here. It can be busy because it's popular. Parking is free and it's right off the San Diego river and a good walking trail that's beautiful. A very nice location amidst the great shopping in Mission Valley.< /Review>

Excellent and tasty food in a homey environment. Order anything off their menu and you will be delighted with their unique version of old classics. Prices are reasonable. Staff is friendly. Only problem is that this restaurant in Mission Valley is so popular, there is some trouble finding close parking. But the walk will just help you burn off some of those calories. 😀</review>

<text>They have a lot of awesome lunch and dinner items but I'm partial to the pain perdu myself. If you've never had breakfast here, I highly recommend trying it! Friendly tip, they serve it all day!

Update! Back here again! As always, the staff here are amazing and make it a great experience. We had a mild issue with part of our order this time around and the staff were extremely helpful, fixing it right away and the manager even coming out to personally make sure everything else was alright! I definitely reccomend this restaurant!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1571612694738, 'text': "DiAnne Bonjour and thank you for recommending us!

This Cafe is beautiful and a hidden gem in San Diego. We loved the food and ambiance.  It was full and we had to wait for 10minutes to get our table but they had free cornbread (which was delicious) and coffee for customers in the waiting area. They had free coffee and drink refills for us after we were seated and we loved how courteous the staff was. Overall our experience at french themed restaurant was 5/5 and this should not be missed when in town.</Text>

When you first walk in, they offer complimentary coffee and cornbread; a nice touch. The mango mimosa was delicious. I had the brioche French toast, wasn't my thing, but it was decent. They had turkey sausage as an alternative, great for the non-pork eater like myself. Service was wonderful and quick. Just wish my food had been hot when I first received it.< /Review>

< Review>
I recently visited Mimi's for my mother's birthday. It is always very busy and packed with people. I was looking forward to it because I like their food and especially love their muffins! Unfortunately, I was disappointed this visit. The service was so slow and the food took forever! I ordered the quiche and was not impressed. I didn't tell anyone because I didn't want to complain, but there's a very good chance that I won't be returning.<//Review>

<text>All these years in San Diego yet this is my first time at Mimi's Cafe. It is really cute inside and rather charming. Old fashioned themed but not out-dated. French style decor. Very friendly and professional staff. My server was Tracy. I had a summer salad with walnuts, mandarin oranges, feta, avocado and chicken with a light lemon dressing. Very flavorful. They serve breakfast, too! So...as Arnold Schwarzenegger says, "I'll be back."<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I was not too impressed with the changeover from one server getting off duty to the other. We sat for about 10mins before our order was taken by the 1st server. By the time our food came out the 2nd server took over and I already lost my appetite for this restaurant. I ordered some French toast while my partner had the omelette. I may return to another location but definitely not this one. 2stars deducted for long wait times.</Text>< userid>

Food was great. Service was mediocre at best. Decaf coffee was served cold. After ordering DIET Coke and stressing the DIET three times we were served regular Coke. Followup was pretty much non-existent. We were there at least 30 minutes longer than we needed to be just waiting for our waiter. We will be back but we hope we get better service.</Review>

Catchy French name has little to do with food quality. Dishes look much better on the menu color photos than when brought to your table. Service atrocious. Could not find a host/ess to seat us and finally had to pick our own table. Waiter seemed disinterested and got our drinks wrong. Sole en papillote tasted like a frozen microwave dinner. Were not offered desert although several enticing photos were posted on the menu. Will not earn any Michelin stars.<//review>

Restaurant interior has always been clean and orderly - BUT - first time using bathroom.  Men's bathroom was DISGUSTING (0 star) !!  Not going back until super clean or remodeled.

I usually love Mimi's. Today was a bad experience. Long wait to be seated. Bigger parties that were seated after we had ordered received their meals before us. Our food was cold. Looks like the cook made a mistake. Potatoes come with the breakfast, but I always order sauteed spinach, there were a few potatoes on the plate. Everything was cold. Not a happy camper.<//review>

<review>There's good and not so good experiences depending on the time and day you go. Honestly, our lunch yesterday was way below this rating but it's been better other times.

Stay away from the brie and mushroom "burger", as it's more of a sandwich but not good.

The bread given to you at the beginning was the best thing.

Breakfast options are good though. That's good.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

The spacious dining area accommodated high chairs nicely without crowding anyone. The menu has a stunning variety that can please just about everyone and certainly did today. The food was good, hot, and fresh, there was no annoying big screen TV or loud music to compete with, and our waitress Megan was prompt and helpful and full of smiles. Thank you for a great family day lunch!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Made reservations for Thanksgiving Dinner... Worse service I've ever experienced. My "waitress" got everything wrong and did so with a blank face.  The food was semi-warm and loaded with sugar.  I couldn't taste the yams as they were drowned in syrup.  The stuffing was mushy and not very flavorful.  But hey, the turkey was good. ☺</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80d9553cc9b02c99:0xb9f2b04ca3b9c6d6< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Almost 2 hours for breakfast. We got there and the hostess told us 10 minutes for the table it ended up being 45. After that 45 more minutes for the food to arrive to the table. Food was simple but good, nothing special. I would think twice before coming back.<//Text>

TERRIBLE!!!!! We had a contract to host a monthly breakfast, having around 50 guests last month, and they double booked our room for this month without notifying. Very disappointing way of doing business. Need to scramble to get another location in one day. They will hear from us in the next few days.<//review>

We just were there and waited for several minutes to even be greeted. Finally, after being seen but not greeted by several of the wait staff, someone said "be right with you", but no one came over to seat us.so we left.< /Review>

It was REALLY cold in the restaurant and raining ☔ outside, but they still had the a/c pumping out cold air. I had gotten the corn chowder to warm up and it was good, but had cooled off too much to finish it, before 10 minutes had even passed... 👎< /review>

She suggested Mimi's Cafe and I said sure.  I mean I've never been there, so I will give it a go.  Finding it was fairly easy, but parking... woof.  I lucked out, but my sister and lots of other people were circling that lot like vultures.  The wait for a table was long... long... and that's why I hesitate to give the fifth star.  When we finally got seated, they were kind enough to bring us a combination of breakfast and lunch menus.  Nice, but for an indecisive person... deadly.  In fact, I was torn... eventually I decided on the lunch menu, then I had to narrow it down from there.  I ended up with the Mediterranean Pasta with Chicken.  Our service was friendly, although we went through most of the meal without refills on any of our drinks, which was a bit of a bummer.

My pasta was delicious... not a whole lot of artichokes, but lots of sun dried tomatoes and chicken!  The sauce was really good as well, creamy, but had a lovely flavour.  I wish they had a half portion, because that would be just right.  Other things ordered at the table:  Chicken Pot Pie, Children's spaghetti, Pumpkin Spice Pancakes, and another breakfast dish.  Everyone ate their food and enjoyed it... my sister was in love with the pancakes and kind of made me wish that I had ordered them.  My nephew thought that he was going to need two entrees, but he didn't need it and it was a good thing he didn't order another dish.  My niece decided she wanted have dessert... and she narrowed it down by how much room she still had in her tummy... I wish I was that young and innocently silly again.<//review>

<Review>From the time we were greeted at the door it wasn't very friendly. Our server wasn't on top of things she had too many tables to deal with. When I tried to ask her for something she wasn't very accommodating and tried to make excuses instead of apologizing for anything that went wrong. The food wasn't up to par and usually we like it alot. We had a Chinese chicken salad and there was very little chicken and the dressing was very watery not the norm</Review>< Time>

<review>Burger cooked rare as I ordered, perfectly cooked. Meat had no seasoning, blah taste. No napkins, salt and pepper, or utensils are included, could have used some salt and pepper on the meat. Also no ketchup, mustard, mayo or ranch dressing included for the fries, ( I like mayo with mine ). Sourdough was soggy and serving a burger on bread rather than a bun leaves bites of nothing but bread in the corners. Discovered a long hair in my mouth about halfway through eating my burger......ugh...disgusting! Might try Mimi's steak in person, so if I find a hair in my food I can get my $$ back. I will order from Crust Kitchen next time I want a Burger though....they are perfect!!!< /review><user_name>T</user_name>< resp>

Also no ketchup, mustard, mayo or ranch dressing included for the fries, ( I like mayo with mine ). Sourdough was soggy and serving a burger on bread rather than a bun leaves bites of nothing but bread in the corners. Discovered a long hair in my mouth about halfway through eating my burger......ugh...disgusting! Might try Mimi's steak in person, so if I find a hair in my food I can get my $$ back. I will order from Crust Kitchen next time I want a Burger though....they are perfect!!!<//Text>

Food took 45 minutes to arrive.  Never did receive the bread as it was cooking in the oven.  Waitress acted like she didn’t want to work there.  Saw others returning their food for various reasons.  When our food arrived, it was cold, meat was dry and tough and the lettuce was wilted and slimey.  We used to love this chain but now we won’t be back.</Review>

<Text>The service was terrific. The food,not so much. I had the pork medallions with au gratin potatoes and fresh green beans. All of it was very dried out the meat was dry, the potatoes especially very dry and the green beans not only were not cooked even to Al Dente but they were dry. What seems to be a running Norm the last few times we have been there, I'm sorry to see that what used to be fairly decent place to go for a medium-priced meal no longer serves a good  meal.< /Text><response>None</response></record>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>Typical chain restaurant , but admittedly one of my favorites.  I love the menu here, the baked goodies, and overall ambience.  Our waitress was absolutely stellar even though she was practically working by herself as it was almost closing time.  Everything came out quickly and she made sure to check in on us regularly.  Only issue was that we ordered zucchini that was so oversalted that our mouths were watering and we couldn't continue eating it.  Luckily we were so stuffed by everything else we found no need to send it back or replace it.  I made sure to let our waitress know, and she was genuinely concerned and informed the kitchen to make an attempt to fix the problem.  Even though everything wasn't 100% perfect this time around, I would still definitely return to this location based on my overall satisfaction with Mimi's as a whole .  Bonus is that they offer military discount here as well as a ton of promotions from social media and their e club.< /text>< pictures>

Pork chop had to be at least 1 1/4in and was juicy, which is difficult to do for a pork chop, and they had a salad that had cranberries and Apple slices, and walnuts.

<review>Typical chain restaurant , but admittedly one of my favorites.  I love the menu here, the baked goodies, and overall ambience.  Our waitress was absolutely stellar even though she was practically working by herself as it was almost closing time.  Everything came out quickly and she made sure to check in on us regularly.  Only issue was that we ordered zucchini that was so oversalted that our mouths were watering and we couldn't continue eating it.  Luckily we were so stuffed by everything else we found no need to send it back or replace it.  I made sure to let our waitress know, and she was genuinely concerned and informed the kitchen to make an attempt to fix the problem.  Even though everything wasn't 100% perfect this time around, I would still definitely return to this location based on my overall satisfaction with Mimi's as a whole .  Bonus is that they offer military discount here as well as a ton of promotions from social media and their e club.</review></record>

It was my mother in laws 93rd birthday yesterday....what she wanted for dinner was a bowl of Mimi's corn chowder; she used to have it frequently but not for quite awhile.  There were four of us at dinner....three meals were delicious....the corn chowder?  1st bowl was barely warm - got up to ask the food server to bring a hot bowl.  He said ok, but it didn't happen.  Then the original server was at the table asking how everything was...well...cold soup.  She took the bowl and came back pretty quickly with a replacement.  It was a little warmer but a far cry from a bowl of hot soup.  My MIL was not interested in trying for a 3rd bowl.  They did give her a nice slice of birthday cake.  It was only my 2nd time at Mimi's - the first time quite awhile ago was excellent.  Last night everyone seemed a bit hectic and hurried...< /text>

This one however has broken the streak. I have never had such lousey service. I can echo most of the previous reviews. The wait staff at this location needs some basic training. 15 minutes to be acknowledged by the server. Another 15 to get the drinks. Another 10 to have our order taken. Then after 22 minutes, I had to get the manager to bring us our soup. I could write a novel here but they don't deserve my time. On another note, the men's room was filthy.< /Review>< pictures>

Service was so so. Food was fine qnd consistent with what I expect at Mimis. Wait was about 15 minutes though he was not seating people in the order they arrived and he had no sign in. Very disorganized.</Text>

Mimi's has really gone downhill. They discontinued the broccoli cheddar soup and a lot of my other favorites like the ciabatta turkey avocado bacon sandwich. Cute place, nice staff, probably won't be coming back. All of the locations back in Orlando closed, and I think I know why now.<//Review>

Extremely slow service , rude waitresses I don't get what the hype is about. I went in saying imma grab a quick snack and only have half an hour. The waitress refused to take order and said the other lady will . The other waitress took 20 mins to come by. Didn't have much time left so asked for the desert only and they took 10 minutes to bring that out, and the desert was a muffin . They were rude when I walked up to them we were ready to place our order they were ride when they refused to take order and they were dismissive as I kep saying we only have 30 mins and it wasn't even that busy. Places like these need to close<//text>

< Review>
Extremely slow service , rude waitresses I don't get what the hype is about. I went in saying imma grab a quick snack and only have half an hour. The waitress refused to take order and said the other lady will . The other waitress took 20 mins to come by. Didn't have much time left so asked for the desert only and they took 10 minutes to bring that out, and the desert was a muffin . They were rude when I walked up to them we were ready to place our order they were ride when they refused to take order and they were dismissive as I kep saying we only have 30 mins and it wasn't even that busy. Places like these need to close< /Review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Text>Now, I know you have passed by the restaurant seeing that the outside decor is not very attractive. However, the food is absolutely amazing! The inside decor is much better though. The Mimi's in Atlanta has the same good quality food. So now everywhere I go I look for a Mimi's. The food is absolutely amazing! Their chicken and waffles (pause -
mmm mmm mmm....mmm!) stands far (miles) above Roscoe's (trust me, you ain't missing nothing at Roscoe's. And they charge extra for everything (but won't tell you upfront), including the condiments). Anyway, I have never been disappointed no matter what I order. Coming from someone that can't stand carrot cake, their muffins (carrot muffins and fingerlings included) are wonderful. The pineapple one is my favorite though. Never had anything like it! Because of this restaurant I am now a big fan of french cuisine, although it's the only french restaurant I go to (ha ha). The restaurant was never really busy which was another reason I avoided it for so long, but man, people don't know what they are missing!<//Text>< name>

<review>Talk about lousy service! I'm visiting town, so I Googled restaurants in the area, and found this Mimis. I looked through the menu, again through Google and phoned in my order. So someone picks up at Mimis, I asked for a certain appetizer, and he said they don't carry that. I asked for a main course and again he said they don't carry that item either. So I mention I'm looking at their menu online, and he states "you must be looking at a 10 year old menu" and hangs up on me! Way to exhibit great customer service. Needless to say, I took my business to another one of the many chain restaurant neighbors this location has.< /review>< name>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Now, I know you have passed by the restaurant seeing that the outside decor is not very attractive. However, the food is absolutely amazing! The inside decor is much better though. The Mimi's in Atlanta has the same good quality food. So now everywhere I go I look for a Mimi's. The food is absolutely amazing! Their chicken and waffles (pause -
mmm mmm mmm....mmm!) stands far (miles) above Roscoe's (trust me, you ain't missing nothing at Roscoe's. And they charge extra for everything (but won't tell you upfront), including the condiments). Anyway, I have never been disappointed no matter what I order. Coming from someone that can't stand carrot cake, their muffins (carrot muffins and fingerlings included) are wonderful. The pineapple one is my favorite though. Never had anything like it! Because of this restaurant I am now a big fan of french cuisine, although it's the only french restaurant I go to (ha ha). The restaurant was never really busy which was another reason I avoided it for so long, but man, people don't know what they are missing!<//review>< Pics>

First off I grew up going to the original 2 Mimis in OC & was employed by Mimi's in Rancho Cucamonga CA so I am very familiar with how Mimi's used to operate & train employees & how their food should taste & be prepared.  The Mission Valley location is not the way the Mimi's Yorba Linda runs or their food tastes. I have asked & been told when I have asked why is it different & I mean not good than other Mimi's, & have been told recipes have been changed. Well considering the location in Yorba Linda & Santa Ana still taste like always & the service & knowledge of the company & food etc is still the same. I think Mimi's needs to retrain all Mission Valley employees including management & make sure all recipes are followed everywhere consistently. I will not return to the Mission Valley location ever again.< /Text>

I used to work in the back kitchen.  I 'd to tell my family to go eat somewhere else since, when it got busy, a lot of the cooks would literally sweat on the food as they were making it.  If you've ever looked back there, the kitchen is small and crowded and hot, and many of the fairly used ingredients are uncovered---"too bad if you're sick, come in anyway since we need you to work."  Coughs, sneezes..no problem..it's Mimi's Cafe for you!</text>

The nastiest men's bathroom I have ever seen in a restaurant. We split the New York Strip with fries and it was not good at all. Very tough cut and it was not cooked well and very dry.  Nothing positive to say about Mimi's<//text>

<text>(Translated by Google) This was the first time we visited this place, we went for dinner, but honestly I didn't like it. One of the dishes we ordered was salty and the second dish the chicken was stale and we let the waitress know. We received some muffins as compensation for what happened at the meal. The waitress's attention was always excellent. I'm sorry but I won't be back 😬

Esta fue la primera vez que visitamos este lugar, fuimos a cenar, pero  sinceramente no me gustó. Uno de los platillos que ordenamos  estaba salado y el segundo platillo el pollo estaba duro y se lo hicimos saber a la mesera que nos atendió. Recibimos unos muffins como compensación por lo sucedido de la comida. La atención de la mesera siempre fue excelente. Lo siento pero no volveré 😬</text>< Rating>
