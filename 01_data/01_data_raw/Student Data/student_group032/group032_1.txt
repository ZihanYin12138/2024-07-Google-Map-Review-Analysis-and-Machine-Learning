This is the second time that I have come to CPR to fix my cracked phone screen. I was very pleased the first time they fix my screen which took about a day because they had to order in the screen for my phone. Frank knew how important it was for me to get my phone fixed ASAP. Frank was amazing and went above and beyond by calling another store to get the screen that I needed and get my phone fixed the same day. I would highly recommend this place to all my friends.</Text>

I don't write many reviews , but these guys are the best
Twice I went in and they fixed my problem for free! The times they kept it the price was reasonable and the work was done quickly and correctly. All the other places say  " Drop it off we will look at it and get back to you" My phone IS my business and these guys got me right back in business by the time the others would still be looking at it. Sent my wife there alone knowing she would get the best service and price. If only more places could be like these guys! How do I give 6 stars?!< /review>

As in the other reviews I read here, these guys took my Ipad and had it done later that day. I brought it home and I think I had an app I had just downloaded that caused a strange power cycle so they told me to bring it back. They pulled it open again and found no issues with it, ran a good several hour diagnostic test on it and assured me it was working fine. Which it was, and is.

I can't thank them enough for not only doing great work on the ipad but when I had an issue that was definitely pilot error, (my fault), they took more time out their schedule to chase it down.

GREAT service. Fast and thorough. I will definitely use them again. Hopefully not too soon though!

ROUND 2-

I had 3 older iPhones that needed to be looked at and again, they came through with great service. 1 cracked screen was fixed that day and they looked at the older iPhone 6s to see if they could be salvaged. Got one going and the last one just wouldn’t come back to life. They spent a good amount of time trying.

This repair store is incredible. I highly recommend them.</Review><time>1620865546729</time>< user_name>

Wow, Frank quoted me one Price...
Once he rang it up!  it was less than the in person verbal quote.
I have had 3 screens replaced here on my old 5s, and finally upgraded to a 7+...
Frank will take care of you.

We needed to get my daughter’s screen replaced on her phone, so I called around to a bunch of places in the area. CPR Cell Phone Repair (Simi Valley) was the only place that had the screen in stock, and they were less expensive than everyone else.

Frank scheduled us for a same day appointment. He was friendly, fast, and incredibly professional. We will definitely be back!< /Text>

My experience was very good.  The representative was very friendly and helpful.  I needed the top screen replace and he managed to put it on perfect.  In my past visits the screen isn't or does not have a right fit making it very difficult to text because the letters on the edge such as p l o and 0 have to be pressed so hard that the phone slips out of my hand causing the screen to crack.  I am very happy to say that this representative put it on perfect! Thank you very much.</text>

<Text>I had a new battery put in an I-Pad. When I called to ask about the service I asked about what kind of battery they used. I didn’t get a straight answer. That should have told me not to have them replace the battery. The cost was about a third the cost of a new I-Pad, $129 which seemed ok since other then the battery the I-Pad was fine. I have two I-Pads. My second I-Pad is older and has the original battery. The battery life of the replacement is less then half that of the old I-Pad. For the cost I expected a battery equivalent to the original. I didn’t get that. Yes the people are nice and good to work with, just don’t have them replace a battery. Well it turns out that they really do have a good warranty as well as great customer support. They corrected the problem without a question. Their after sales service is fantastic.<//Text>< pics>

Everyone that works here is amazing. I have the privilege of having children that enjoy breaking every smart device I own. They have worked with me and fixed everything that I have taken to them. They are nice, to the point and they actually enjoy their job and helping people fix their devices. I send everyone here and I will always send them here. They back their work and do whatever it takes to make sure that the customer is happy .</Text>

Absolutely great. The service from the backroom tech was fantastic with the quality of work and the gentleman at the front counter was professional, nice and informative. The price for my repair was reasonable as well. Get your repairs done by then.
They fixed my IPhone 6Plus.</text>

Been here 2 times first time they replaced screen but couldn't repair phone (fell off a car and then got ran over by another car) they just charged me for screen (more then fair). Second time they told me it would be 2 hours to put a new screen on my S8 plus ....45 minutes later phone was finished. Great service polite and friendly. Plus they give you lifetime warranty - which other places doesn't do. Highly recommend</Text>

Customer service was amazing! Sam tried multiple things to make sure that my phone got fixed and even after spending lots of time trying to figure out the problem was willing to let me go free of charge if nothing worked. He ended up fixing the problem! He replaced my battery and charging port for only $97!! Such a nice guy who knows what he's talking about.</Review>

When I drop the phone for battery issue, they told me the replace the battery will fix the issue, and it is under their warranty ( I replaced the battery a month ago). This is great! however, when I went to pick up my phone, they told me that my touch screen does not work. It was working when I dropped it off. so I have to pay even more for them to fix the touch screen issue. This tasted like a bad food in my mouth, and I have to swallow it.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1550685715267, 'text': "Zhiwei,\n\nYou brought your device in the other day after you had your battery replaced a month ago. You clearly stated multiple times that you've dropped the phone a few times and the screen was going on and off and now the phone doesn't turn on. You asked if this can be caused by the battery to which we said we would take a look at it. We did not tell you another battery replacement would fix the issue. We don't give verbal diagnostics for phones that come in with no power or display without taking them apart because we don't know what's wrong with them. After we took the phone apart and got it to turn on, we saw your screen had lines going down the side of it and the touch wasn't working. This is an indication of your touch digitizer being damaged on your screen. Multiple drops would cause this. A battery replacement or taking the phone apart and putting it back together wouldn't cause your touch to be damaged and not working. However dropping your phone multiple times like you stating you did would.\n\nBest,\n\nCPR Cell Phone Repairs"}< /resp><gmap_id>0x80e82ec5f363f995:0x168b0b3fc7994de4< /gmap_id></record>

Great experience I got my iPhone 6s repaired along with my iPad Air for the cheapest price. I shopped around they were the cheapest and quickest turn around. Super friendly staff. Had many accessories to choose from.< /review>

DO NOT COME HERE. also the installs they do are very unprofessional and lazy. noticed that the home button was loose and not put back in place.< /Text>< pictures>

<response>{'time': 1531504997160, 'text': "Hi Trevor,\n\nI'm sorry to hear you feel that way. You called a little while ago stating that you got your phones screen fixed 4 months ago and now your home button isn't working. We explained to you that the screen repair wouldn't cause the home button to malfunction and that the two issues are unrelated especially if the problem arose 4 months after the repair. However, we told you to still bring it in and that we would take another look at it for you and that we could probably fix the issue. Not that we would probably look at it. I'm sorry if this wasn't explained more clearly. The only thing we do with your home button is transfer it from your broken screen to the new screen when we do the repair. If there was an issue with the home button during the repair it would've been noticed immediately as we do test it before giving it back to you. You're stating that the work we did was lazy and it wasn't put back in place well yet you never brought up that concern or brought the phone in for us to look at for 4 months. Regardless of all that, you can still bring the phone in and we would be more than happy to take another look at it for you. If we can fix the issue without replacing any parts we would still do it for free. I hope this information helps. Please let me know if there's anything else we can do for you.\n\nBest,\n\nAM Cell Phone Repairs"}<//response><Gmap_id>0x80e82ec5f363f995:0x168b0b3fc7994de4< /Gmap_id></record>

DO NOT GO HERE.  Brought my iphone in for a screen.   They checked the charging port for “free”.  They said it needed a charging port and would only take a half hour to do.   After having it for 2 days and was told they got a “defective” batch of ports I had them put the old one back in.   And it no longer worked.

Took it to apple and the said the motherboard was broken.   I had to buy a new phone.  Turns out most places don’t want to do them because of this

Went back and they said it worked when I left and there was nothing they would do.< /Text>

< review>
Went in for a diagnose for two of my 3DS XL, and I was told it would take an hour to a day, and then a few days later, I called asking if hey found the issue, and they said no. After a week since I brought the 3DSes in, I called again to ask how they were, and they thought it was a battery issue on both of them, and they said that ordering the batteries to TRY to see if it was the issue would be $90. So, I said no, and picked up the 3DSes the next day. Once I got home, I did a half hour to an hour of research on the issue, and was able to fix one of them (the other 3DS I can’t open up due to some stripped screws). The issue didn’t even have anything to do with the battery, and I was able to fix it in a day and save $90 while they took a week and didn’t find anything!!!<//review>

{'time': 1539205673407, 'text': "Hi Awesomemovies42,\n\nWe are very sorry that we missed the mark with your experience. We just recently started working on gaming consoles so diagnosing them has taken us a little longer than most devices. We also do not keep parts on hand for these devices. We are glad to hear that you were able to get the device working on your own. That's great news. If there is something that you may need in the future please let us know and we will try our best to accommodate you and help in any way we can.\n\nBest,\n\nCPR Simi Valley"}< /Response>

<Review>All these comments are fake and strictly for discount only. I know because I did one too. I've had many phone screens repaired and this one by far was the worst yet. The screen feels very after cheap and now has a fogged frame around the screen. Called the store and asked about warranty and without hesitation they deny that it is their fault or a defect in the product. I would never do business with them or any of their chain stores again.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>
{'time': 1488929615831, 'text': 'Hi David,\n\nWe encourage all of our customers to leave us reviews and share their experience with us. Good ones and bad ones so we can improve. All of these reviews are real experiences. I\'m sorry you felt you didn\'t get a product that met your expectations. We actually use the highest quality replacement parts on the market which is why we offer a 1 year warranty instead of a 30-90 day warranty like most repair shops have. I\'m not sure what you mean by the frame is "fogged" but if the screen is not broken or damaged, then our warranty is fully intact. The warranty is only void if there is liquid damage or physical damage and that is policy set forth by the manufacturers of the parts. Please bring the device in and we can take a look at it in person. Perhaps when you explained the situation to the sales rep over the phone they got the impression that it was "fogging" due to liquid damage. We recommend anyone who has any warranty issues to bring the device in so we can see it in person instead of over the phone so nothing gets lost in communication. I hope this provides some clarification and you can stop by so we can take another look at it for you. Hope to hear from you soon!\n\nBest,\n\nAdam Jaratanian\nAM Cell Phone Repairs'}< /response>

Had an issue with a Samsung S7 not charging. Steve checked it out and told me it was more than the charging port so we decided to get a new Verizon phone. They didn't charge me anything and gave great advice. You can trust this store. Thanks for the help Steve.<//review>

<review>Best laundry in the area. Their machines are in top shape quality both washing and dryers and their customer service is amazing.

The attendants are always available and constantly sanitizing machines and floors and more importantly they have a surveillance system monitored at all times that makes you feel safe during this tough times.</review><Date>1603987540887</Date></record></dataset><record>

<review>Well, What else can one say about this beautiful place when your wife worked here for five years! The owners ( P K M ) always willing to listen to the issues from customers and employees in the most calm, attentive and professional way. They always have a big positive solutions even for the smallest problems,  and because multiple families depend on the jobs that they generate, may GOD bless the owners and the entire Gopez Corporation!! Community this is the place to go !!! 👍👍🙏🙏🙏< /review>< Pictures>

I had a bad experience on a Sunday morning that I was there, there was an African-American woman who was doing Fluff and Fold ? would not letting us use a dryer because she was making that service at that end, although her business there is no indication that there are fluffs and folds  NO SIGNS and she disappeared for a long time going to the back.  I needed the bathroom key.  I can not find her.  Finally she runs out of there and continues to move and fold. 2 women of the same race left her clothes with Robyn , apparently she is good at that service since she was waiting for them outside ready with 2 carts.

<Review>Great place! And the girls who runs it are super nice. They have plenty of washing, drying machines and tables where you can fold your clothes. Also, it has a little space for kids to play and a TV where kids can watch PG movies, that's a plus! They sell detergents if you don't have any or if you don't want to go to closest grocery store because you forgot to bring your. Keep in mind they close at 10:00pm but the last person they allow to enter is around 9:00pm. I was lucky because I had only a basket with dirty clothes and 1 hour was enough for me to get in and out. But if you have a lot of dirty clothes and they are 1 hour from closing. They won't let you in because everyone needs to be out by 10:00pm. Save yourself from wasting to your time if you're late.<//Review><user_name>Eden Izanami<//user_name>< Pics>

This place has poor service and only because of the staff that work their. There is an employee named rosa that attendant me last week and she told me that they dont longer receive old $20 bill anywhere only new ones. Last time i check their no sign saying that. She also told me that if she would to receive it she would get fired. I honestly wouldnt recommend this laundry matto anyone. I would rather walk or drive longer distance to a laundry mat thats not discriminating like this one</review>

If I could give zero starts I would because the treatment from one of the employees does not treat people with respect. The lady name Rosa does not work efficiently, she always talks and does not pay attention if the machines are working or not. I wasted my money because she never said anything about it.</Text>

< Review>
Im giving it a poor reveiw because an employee that works there scared my child and accused him of losing the restroom key on purpose when he acccidently dropped them. She was yelling at him that she was going to post his picture up so people could be aware of him. My child is special need and he wouldnt do things on porpose. I would highly apreciate it if before accusing someone to make sure its accurate. My child was crying and she didnt care one bit that she was scaring him. Her name is rosa. Ive been calling the number where you make complains and nobody answers.</Review>

Horrible experience one Sunday I arrived at 6:30 am and the store was  close I surprise did not sign anything, I returned the next day Monday and now I was worse the employee was washing clothes with her boyfriend or husband and did not give me change after I asked for the key to use the  bath for my 6 year old girl and the employee denied it to me said I am at lunch with gestures and I felt very uncomfortable and then she gave it to me because her husband told her to let me use the bathroom and it was the way my  poor daughter I use the bathroom, but I will not come back and tell my family and friends about the bad service and that they are no longer there, the name of the employee JENNIFER< /Review>

{'time': 1565715406600, 'text': 'Unfortunately, we can confirm that the attendant was late to open last Sunday.  This was an isolated incident and strongly reprimanded the opening attendant.  Also, I agree that this is not the way the attendant should have handled the restroom keys.  We have spoken with our staff and are making sure this never happens again.  On behalf of all our staff, I would like to apologize for your experience and will make sure these are isolated incidents that will not happen again.  Thank you for trying our facility and I hope you give us another chance!  Happy washing! <3'}</Response>

Nice large park with 2 baseball fields. It has two separate playgrounds, bathrooms and a nice flat path all the way around which is great for learning to ride a bike.</Review>

Sabre Springs Park is heavily used for both soccer and baseball/softball. There is a small playground for the little ones that is well maintained. There is not much in the way of parking for the size of fields and because of the shear numbers of youth leagues playing nearly year round, the fields have taken quite a beating. The baseball fields are lit for about an hour or so after dark and there is plenty of lighting on the path that leads around the park frequented by runners and walkers. I typically see people using a long set of stairs to workout on located at the entrance of the park and if that isn’t long enough there is a well worn trail behind the park that will give you plenty of uphill climb. Almost exactly 1/2 mile to the peak. If the fields were in a little better shape I could give this a 5 star rating but it’s been pretty rough for some time and I haven’t seen any improvement.< /Text>

Mr Taco's favorite park to chill and meet other intelligent critters besides canines. Family oriented and safe..HEADS up for the resident Coyote..He's never bothered us due to the large population of Rabbits. Very peaceful place.. if you TURN OFF your electronic devices you'll experience a lot more than a walk in the park. ENJOY😎< /Text>

The park is very nice. We were there for a soccer game. Field was one of the worst I have seen. I am going to guess that it was around 30% grass, 30% weeds and 40% dirt. The dirt was the most playable surface. Come on, more effort.<//Text>

Lovely local park that has a lot of open space for all sorts of fun activities and sports. There is a playground for the kids and a canopy for a outdoors party. A great place to walk around during the day as well. It is located in a very safe neighborhood and there are police who come patrol as well. The park is clean and you can take your dog's for walks here.</Review>

We enjoy early morning walks around the park. Nice to catch up with friends while making four or five loops around the ball fields.</Review>

Just a normal park, went Pokemon hunting here since it was a small nest. Relatively small but clean, nothing stands out particularly about this park. Baseball, bathrooms, concrete picnic tables, barbeque pits.</text>

I'm not certain exactly how long we have been with Sarah and H&R but when we moved to Texas I'm so glad we are able to stay with her and H&R Block.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< GmapID>

< review>
I asked up front how much it would cost to do my personal taxes but they would not give me an answer, finally the receptionist said the average most people pay is 120 to 150 and that my bill would probably be in that range. This sounded a little high I felt 80 dollars would have been fair and that is how much other tax services have charged me in the past such as the year before when I went elsewhere. Jonathan Crosby totaled my bill at $253.00 which I felt taken advantage of. This price is ridiculous. If they had quoted this outrageous fee up front when I asked, I definitely would have not made the appointment with h&r block. This was 103 dollars more than the receptionist guessed and she collects the payments. After speaking to an acquaintance of mine it turns out they also went to h&r block in auburn ca, and they were charged $237.00<//review>

Went here to fax some documents and mail a package. He waited for me after hours. Awesome!! Owner packaged my stuff in a way it came out cheaper. Ended up buying some cards (there’s a large selection). And I also ended up getting some key copies. While there I witnessed how great he is with his mailbox customers. He greets them all and seems to genuinely care for them. I waited a little because he was calling a customer to let them know they received a package. This is great customer service! Place is clean and organized and spacious, which is definitely a plus during Covid. Did I mention he’s open 7 days a week!  Couldn’t get any better!!!🙂< /Review>

<review>I was highly recommended to this establishment by a friend. I had to mail a package and I guess I had packed it wrong. Dimitris gave me some tips on packaging for a better rate. He also repackaged my items and saved me some money. While he was working on my box I noticed the large selection of cards he has (pretty unique and hilarious). If you haven’t been here you should stop by to see for yourself. It’s a gem in Montana. And from what I see a one stop shop. He offers a variety of services.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Stay clear of this place. The owner (and what looks to be the only employee) is rude and when questioned about why certain things are higher priced that what I deemed appropriate for market value, he started to be verbally abusive to me.
I get it - he is a "for profit" business, but it is still a buyers market, and asking a simple question does not warrant the behaviour he exhibited.
Better off to go to Montana Mail down the road a few blocks where the service is at least consistently great.</Review>

{'time': 1600503412997, 'text': "Because you don't like the prices on a convenience store on Montana Avenue it doesn't make the shopkeeper unprofessional.  That makes you rude, narcissistic.  You are not entitled to decide what rates a small business should charge. Montana is a high end street and rents are very expensive. If you don't like the prices on Montana Avenue please go to the Post Office on Olympic and 7th wait in the long lines and don't take the convenient approach.  It's a free country you know.  Montana Avenue is definitely not on your budget.  I wonder when you go to Starbucks to get your morning coffee, do you complain about the rates there? Buddy grow up!  Real men don't bash small businesses online. We have better things to do.\nI was thinking what kind of a satisfaction you are getting by spending your time writing a bad review on a small business which has done absolutely nothing to you.  Are you really trying to provide your personal feedback about the business or are you just trying to feed on your narcissistic ego.  If that makes you feel good, more power to you.\nThank you."}</response>

Unprofessional and charges high rates. Avoid at all costs. Look at multiple reviews on Google as to the pattern of behavior.

And then the shop keeper goes on a delusional judgmental rant in response to his eccentric and unprofessional behavior in the process of running his store. Real men get mental help when they need it. Find a shrink soon. Whack jobs such as yourself give good businesses on Montana Ave and grown men a bad name. Sack up and fix your problems instead of taking them out on potential customers. Weirdo!< /review>

Thank you.\nIf I was a motivational speaker I would not write anything negative online about any small business and lie about it just food for though keep the lies and the venom to your self.\nAlso, as a multi-million dollar deal motivational speaker, you would think supporting local small business entrepreneurs would be part of your fabric, instead, you bash and lie because you didn't like the prices again this is a convenience store......Is this how you treat people......just very disrespectful and shows a great deal regarding your business practices and integrity."}< /response>< rating>

<review>Rude & unhelpful (intially posted). The business owner has responded and implied that I "want everything for FREE." This is not the case. I called this place and inquired about pricing. I never asked for anything, but when I suggested that the prices sounded high to me the business owner was rude and hung-up on me. He never packaged anything for me, and I have no idea why he referencing "tape" (as I've never done business with him). As a business owner, it's important not to undermine others, but I was really surprised to hear someone both reacting in this way and then to read a complete fabrication of our conversation.< /review><username>Jaison Morgan< /username></record>

I called and asked if they had usps envelopes and he said no but I can buy his envelopes. I said I have the labels printed and it has to be an envelope by usps. He said that I can’t get things for free and he needs to make a living. You can’t sell USPS things for money that are free and a simple no would have been a good response.< /text>

Dimitri is outstanding and works hard to meet his customers' needs, while providing humor and care.  He makes it seamless to perform any mailing transaction, and goes the extra mile to help out creatively with other printing issues not necessarily part of standard business.

It is disappointing to read some of the negative reviews.  Sadly, it seems both the anonymity and uncensored freedom of posting, creates an opportunity for some people to deep dive into damaging, poisonous and uncensored diatribes.  This is disheartening both for the harm it can affect on this gentleman's business, and for the corrosion it ultimately causes to our sense of humanity and regard.

Dimitri's Postal Place is a private business. Some people use his business as a post office to drop off their boxes for mailing.  Dimitri provides free mailing to his customers, as a courtesy, with the exception of UPS, which he now charges $1 for most box sizes.  Dimitri's store is not the Post Office, or a UPS store, or a Fedex store.  However, some individuals have the impression his private business is there as a free public service.  It is unfortunate that some of those people who have benefitted from Dimitri's kindnesses and generosity, would so abuse him in this google forum.

I can only suggest to any readers who are investigating postal services for the Santa Monica area, give Dimitri's Postal Place, a fair chance.  There always seems to be room for parking in the back, and items you may need for mailing, readily available, in addition to complete mailing services.

Thank you Dimitri for your service, your care and your integrity.

<text>Very unprofessional, poor phone service, no decorum on how to treat victims of crime, and other violence including human trafficking. I'm pretty sure the plaintiff payed off my lawyer. I mentioned elements of the crimes I endured, and she laughed at me.  That lawyer, if she can really be called one, denied me my right to three witnesses during a housing matter, and other evidence, and the judge used it against me. That person did not keep updated at crucial moments. She cut me off inappropriately, and constantly used the excuse she had other cases as if that time mattered more than mine. This place needs to seriously be looked at as they claim to help vulnerable people, and the help I received could maybe only minimally be called help.

<text>A waste of time. If I would wait for their response on my case I would never got where I did on my own. I left them all the information and scanned my documents but for what? I got my issue solved all on my own through struggles and lies. After a few month they call me to ask if I can provide them with update and documents on my case. Like for real? You want from me proves that my issue is solved and put it in your statistic, so it looks good for donors?</text>< pictures>

It's basically what it says, a legal service. They are firm on maintaining and establishing agreement or solution to your issues. They serve low income individuals & famlies. They will ask you a lot of questions to place you accordingly and see if they can handle a lmk llo case. Be sure to call ahead and not just drop by. They're appointment only,
Be sure to bring your proper papers. The more accurate they are the better they are in obtaining a better result. My
Plus the location has a really, REALLY, good hamburger joint just about 1/2 block down.<//Review>

I needed information about "debt collections" but after waiting 50 minutes to see a representative I was send to Hilda Ramirez who said that since I did not had my residency card with me, she could not give me any information. When I asked what other documents I needed to show her, she replied that she could not give me any information until she saw a copy of my residency card.
Her attitude was unprofessional, rushed and uncooperative. What good is it to offer help and information to the public if the representatives are unwilling to provide the service they offer. The staff needs to be properly train and prepare to informe the clients of the requirements needed to see a representative as soon as the client walks in the door.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x809460a3d9776fab:0x4c82186787051d0a< /gmapID></record>

<name>3rd world Citizens<//name>< Review>
I called the legal referral line, and the woman who answered did not care about a word. I had to say, my son and I were victims prejudice and inhumane living conditions. Provided by Fresno County. Thier website advertises they are champions of injustices. Yea only if they can profit from your claim. They do not care about the little guy. The woman who answered was rude and cold, who handed off the phone to what I can assume was a supervisor. Who not only laughed but cursed at me. My son and I are homeless at the moment and went to Fresno County for assistance, they supplied a voucher in the sum of $847 for 7 nights at approved hotel location. The economy inn, upon arriving there I learned that this business was booked full of families in similar circumstances as myself. After the 3 day of our stay my son was in a lot of pain. He had a extreme allergic reaction to bed bug bites, I didn’t know it at first. Since my son does suffer from allergies. I thought maybe it was from the lethal amount of bleach the cleaning staff uses. Since it’s mandatory they clean everyday. After my first night there I thought it was odd they demanded they come in. My son and I stayed in this nightmare place 1 day too many after my sons extremely painful hives did not clear up after buying him antihistamines and calamine lotion. I took him the emergency where the doctors asked about my living conditions. I told the doctor my situation and told me my son skin was reacting to bed bug bites. To get away from that place as soon as possible. I took action and went back to my room and scoured every nook and cranny up u til this point the cleaning staff does such a good job covering up the infestation you never see a bug. But the level of infestation it was not hard to find them. My son was playing on the bed while I conducted my search. When accidentally kicked down the head board, and to my horror millions of bugs came flooding out. I went into protective mode grabbed  my son. Took pictures of his bites and of the bed, the headboard that was now overflowing with parasites. After gathering as much evidence as I could stomach I took off to the front desk. To which the front desk clerk did not even looked surprised or taken back by my claims. Told me he was just the night clerk I needed to wait for the owner to arrive in the morning and I could move to the room next door, WTF ARE FREAKING KIDDING ME?! I showed him my sons injuries and he was not in the slightest moved or had any compassion. Than asked wait are you welfare? I replied what does that matter your establishment is taking advantage of vulnerable families! Family’s who need a safe and clean environment while they figure out a solution. Your disgusting business is collecting hundreds and thousands of tax payers dollars and deceiving Fresno County promising low income or homeless families a safe place to stay. This is unacceptable I refused to put my son in that unsafe and just inhumane living conditions. I had to scrape what little money I did have and get a room at safer cleaner not to mention far less expensive room. The next day I spent everything I had and figure out a way to get gas money so I could make it back to the economy inn to speak to the owner of that disgusting place. Me and other families have been treated like garbage the other families I spoke too have been bit and injured but are afraid to lose thier benefits. I called this number hoping to get help and all I got was insults and feelings of despair just because the world wants to label me a 3rd world citizen DOES NOT MEAN MY SON AND I ARE ONE! Families like me become complacent because the world looks down on us. But we are human too! And deserve to be treated with respect and dignity if you are like me and looking for genuine help don’t call this place. They are wolfs in sheep’s clothings working for the State and playing the little buy for a fool</Review>

< Review>
My lawyer referred me to then to what I was told they were supposed to healthcare problems of not receiving healthcare when needed also deal with what was discremination. I explained very clearly what happened and UnitedHealth care told me to request that my co pay be waived because they knew what I went through was wrong. Ccls told me they could help me. After months of hearing nothing I called to find out what was going on. They pretty much said they didn't believe me and that harassment denial of medical services and obvious discremination directly related to my disability. All I wanted was a letter to UnitedHealth care asking they waive my co pay. That is what uhc told me to do. So now after months of them saying they're working on it. They now say they can't help me. But pretty sure the statue of limitations is over due to the time they wasted. Next time I'll gladly pay my attorney to handle my legal issues. TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND EFFORT.<//Review>

This office is mismanaged.  They need to use their funding for all kinds of law, not just the limited offers they have.  They are not covering estate law, leaving scammers the opportunity to exploit us here as a population.  We go to the cops, they won't help with complaints, we go to CenCal, they don't cover this kind of law, we wind up blowing our money on paid lawyers that don't score well on AVVO, they often lose.  This has to be addressed with some kind of suit and/or news investigation.< /Review>

<text>First call, a woman answered and asked where I wanted to be directed. I told her I did not know, but I had a question. I told her I called Fresno City Hall and they had directed me to Central California Legal Services for advice on a former landlord bill that was sent to me. She told me to hold, then I realized I was disconnected. I called back immediately, no answer and it went to their message system. I hung up and called again, same thing message system. Called again and this woman (same one I presume) answered and says "Yea!?" (with an attitude). I responded, "I was just on hold and I believe we disconnected...", she in turn responds, "Oh" (hang up). Now I'm like "what the !!?" So I call again, no answer. Call again, and this time a woman answers again. I repeat that I was on hold but disconnected, this woman replies, "Oh sorry, it was me. I must have disconnected you. I'm sorry. What was your problem again?".... I told her my former landlord sent me a ridiculous bill and how I could contest it. I even asked to speak with a legal representative and she replied she was an intern or something and that she was going to refer me originally when I had first called. She then told me to call "Small Claims Advisors". Wow! ... Such a hassle and then just toss me somewhere else. Seriously what is up with this woman!?

I looked up the site prior to calling them. Said it was a non-profit, but they got some stupid people answering the phones and they have attitude. I understand some people don't like their job, but don't act like an idiot. If you don't like your job, then don't work there. You job is to help people who call and not just be a moron, then give me another number to call.

What a horrible experience......!?</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Went to the ER last night with severe lower abdominal pain. I have a history of diverticulitis. Was there for about 4-5 hours total. The staff was quick to triage me and get me onto a bed. Everyone was extremely caring and sweet. The entire staff would sit down with me and would clearly explain my treatment plan and made me feel so much at ease during the whole process. This was honestly the best hospital experience I have ever had. Thank you so much for making a scary process a little less scary!</text>

<text>We really had to wait a long time in order to find me a room 2 and half an hour. We finally got a room and we waited there for the doctor another 45 minutes! Wait time is too long the waiting room was not that full when we first arrived. The doctor was nice no I’m using my speech recognition caught that he did not stay with me for very long .thanks again Lisa Oops Perocco< /text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I came to Santa Barbra to meet a wonderful orthopedic doctor a Dr. Hurvist I apologize if I spelled it wrong for my left knee repair. He instructed me that he would be doing it at Goleta cottage hospital  and I was a little scared after reading the online reviews but was plesantly surprised when I came to the hospital from Eloise the pre op nurse to Dana the post op nurse and anesthesiologist Nichols was fast and quick. I then was taken to my room 2248 where Jennifer that likes to be called jenn and the wonderful c n a Letti who took excellent care of me during the day. Not to mention your dietary dept is out of this world I thought I was at a four star restaurant they made my food to order and brought it quickly. But I want to thank a few more people who helped me get to healing faster the evening nurse Stephanie and Carmen and the best respiratory crew Glen and Theresa and my physical therapist Julie and Kathy they shine because I was a little scared getting up right away after surgery to walk but they both reassured me that they would be right there for me. And last but not least Stephanie my discharge planner who helped me get home PT at my home in Bakersfield. I will be recommending your hospital in the future to my friends and family. Thank you all for a wonderful stay.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Horrible experience. Had the same female doctor who refused twice to help my severe itching of my hands due to a bad allergic reaction. Had to travel to Santa Barbara's Cottage Hospital to get treated. I definitely feel like I was racially profiled! Don't use this hospital if you are Black! Just saying.<//Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>Took my 4-year-old in this afternoon for what turned out to be a broken arm. In my past experiences, non-pediatric ERs can be really tough for little kids. Not so here. The triage process (even considering covid) was pleasant and quick. The nurses, doctors / PAs, and technicians were so great. My kid walked out in a stabilizing splint + sling, "playing" it like a guitar. Thanks for making a stressful afternoon calmer than it might've been.</review><rating>5</rating>< name>

Excellent care from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave. Dr. Marc Soares took time with me, was kind, compassionate and explained everything. My nurse Tawnya could not have made me feel more secure and comfortable the entire time.< /text>

I had a hip replacement at Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital in March of 2017. I could not have been happier with the whole experience. They put on a very informative seminar each month for those planning or even just considering joint replacement surgery, so I had a good idea what to expect before going in for the procedure. Everyone was very helpful and considerate, the food was really good and available whenever you wanted it like room service in a hotel, and I felt very well taken care of by the nurses, physical therapist, occupational therapist, and the doctors. I can't say enough good things about my surgeon, Dr. Emmerson, and would recommend him to anyone with a joint problem.<//text>

A friend got a sharp pain on his elbow. He went in to ER and an X-ray was taken. He was charged $1200 and guess what, the doctor said the X-ray was blurry and sent him home with pain killer. That’s ridiculous. Isn’t it? I took the X-ray to a family doctor. He said that’s a terrible X-ray.</Text>

I thought I was going to be a video, but it was all through text, In less then an hour I was “hired”, then she said I was going to receive a check to buy supplies...red flag. I felt like she used the word “trust” to often. She told me to contact an email that wasn’t the hospital, and that the hr team wanted the conversation recorded on hangout so she wouldn’t call me, then I requested her work email and she disappeared.

Mean while I’m trying to contact this hospitals hr and security team to let them know, or at least ask. I called about 10xs and I left a voice mail.
I’m over it but I hope they get the bad PR they deserve for this. Someone is impersonating a repressive of your hospital and some was trying to help.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Friend went in after a car accident and he suggested he had a concussion but instead of following through with an already scheduled CT scan they canceled it saying he probably does have one and instead of checking out his back problems and all other pain he has they prescribed him norcos. After waiting about 20 mins for his meds he found out they mixed it up and gave norcos to the patient next door.<//Text>

I came to the emergency room because the nearest kaiser is about an hour away and the uber would’ve been too expensive considering that I’m a college student and don’t own a car. I went to the emergency room because I’ve been having flu like symptoms including body aches, migraines, sore throat, on and off fever, and ear ache. I couldn’t speak clearly because my sore throat made it painful to speak loud but some of the workers were very serious and inconsiderate. I was given a mask since I had flu like symptoms and I didn’t want to get others ill. I was in pain and the doctor didn’t even consider to swab my throat or double check if I had an ear infection. The doctor is white and female. The nurse(who was the only kind person) brought Motrin and Tylenol and I was waiting for some paperwork to be completed. However, as I lowered my ask and Asian male in a serious tone tells me “just because you’re okay and not sick it doesn’t mean that everyone else wants to get sick”.
It was frustrating because the ER was only option and I’ve been in pain the past couple days. My voice is so scratchy and difficult to understand and I was  in pain yet the male was so rude  I’m from Southern California and Kaiser would never treat patients like this.<//Text>

During thomas fire I was evicted and dropped a table on my foot moving, my big toe was hurt and I went to the hospital because it was hard to walk, expecting some kind of help. Dr. Valentine was very insistent on lancing my big toe, I didnt want to because I didnt have a place to live and she refused to give me anti biotic medication regardless of my being very insistent and having cencal. I got a septic infection afterwards, my foot and entire leg were stolen and I had black spider veins coming up from it. I returned to the hospital and was told if it was another day or two my foot or leg would have needed to be removed and I would have been in the hospital for a long time. They put nr under with general anaesthesia and did surgery on my foot. My emergency contact wasnt called and I was allowed to drive away immediately after. They never responded when I called about malpractice.<//Text>< pics>

First off, Morgan is patient and answered multiple questions I had even though I had to repeat a few.

I just moved into my own place recently, I don't have much experience with bills and the process of it. I am switching to a new health provider at the end of this month and wanted to follow up as to why I have not received it in the mail yet. She explained to me that they first have to send it to the provider and also the finalized cost. They are currently pending their response and should send a copy soon.

Additionally, she let me know that my insurance already has the information so it will be taken care of. She shared with me that the process can be a bit tricky if it does not go through in time and some people have to pay out of pocket and to get reimbursement after may take long.

I've read these reviews after my visit and was shocked & even scared. Maybe there are a lot of things that we are unaware of that we don't fully understand. However, I could not shake off the fact that those I have encountered directly are kind, thoughtful and truly genuinely concerned for my well being. That to me is the most important especially when I'm in such a vunerable state. I want to be able to trust who's taking care of me and I feel this way here.

It was a very emotional experience for me because I felt the need to go to the hospital after falling off a bike. I felt silly for going in for something so minor, but was in so much pain. I was blown away of how well I was treated, I am very grateful to have stumbled to this emergency room. Thank you! 🤗<//Text>

Treatment was quick, considering I was there on a holiday and in the emergency room. I received four stitches in my hand and some lidocaine injections. Some thousand dollars later...

I set up a 6-month payment plan once I received my bill, everything is fine, right? I set up auto pay and everything. The month before my last payment is due, I get a notice that I had been sent to collections. What the actual f***?

After contacting Cottage, I was informed that my account and some others had been sent by mistake, the collections company should not be contacting me in any way and my credit would not be affected. "Cottage was to reacquire the accounts by the end of the month." I was told to sit and wait, everything was in order to be fixed. *sigh of relief*  Well, I was relieved until three days later (today)...

Today I received a very stern phone call from the collections agency, stating my account was officially assigned to them and was indeed staying in collections.  They reassured me that Cottage informed them on Monday (when I called everyone initially freaking out) that my account is really delinquent... WHAT?! NO!

It was only after I contacted Cottage again, managed a conference call with them (Terri from billing was extremely patient with all this) AND the collections agency (Maria Hernandez), that they were able to cancel the collections on my account. I sure hope everyone else who was accidentally sent to collections didn't have to go through this nonsense. It was a simple fix to a disastrous mistake, luckily. I'm afraid to get too comfortable too soon with this resolution.

But honestly, how easy is it to accidentally send someone to collections? I really want to know. Whoever made this mistake at Cottage should be fired or written up. Attention to detail is critical when you're in charge of customer accounts and billing. People are afraid of hospitals and healthcare enough with inflated prices and insurance troubles. This kind of mess is just icing on the cake.< /review>

<review>Beware Santa Barbarians. The beloved Cottage Health Company that is touted as a company that does nothing but good is actually the most evil company that could possibly ever exist in Santa Barbara, CA. This is a highly unethical CROOKED company that resorts to ILLEGAL tactics to shut WHISTLEBLOWERS up!!! This company took great pleasure in abusing me for over 8.5 years (as an employee and patient) until I had a complete breakdown, but they didn't stop there. They even continued their harassment campaign once my doctor placed me on medical stress leave. I had lost 60 lbs, my confidence, my hair and my health after experiencing retaliation for reported serous racial remarks made by my co-worker. I was exposed to highly illegal unethical misconduct for 8.5 years! I left with over 1000 pages of the documentation and they have broken into my home to steal my documentation in two different locations. I even moved to LA to get away from the home break ins, cars trying to run me off the road, doctors falsifying medical reports on my behalf, cyber hacking, phone hacking on every level, ecThe director started editing all 8 of my performance reviews and was caught.  I also reported malicious rumors being spread about the sole black person in the office. DEAR COTTAGE HEALTH, why did you let the sole black person in the office get picked on until she had a complete break down? Why did I have to go into the office every day fearful of what my bosses or co-workers would do to me? Why did you guys look the other way and allow this harassment? How could you COVER UP HARASSMENT and stand by a man that states that blacks and mexicans are the worst smelling people on earth? You guys are the most unethical company. How could you assign even MORE work to an INJURED worker and have your Employee Health & Safety Department tell me that they are sure I can handle the extra work load (that was contributing to my injury) and the pay that goes with it. How can a supervisor be allowed to tell me that I look like a lollipop that needs to be sucked and warmed up and get away with it? How could this man call me into his office every day and everyone knew what he was doing to me and would mock me how he would request that I entered his office every day and would close the door the sexually harass me.

Come on Cottage, give answers as to why your ethnic black workers are mistreated. Give them a reason why no matter what role they take on, they cannot get more than a quarter raise.

This company BROKE INTO MY HOME while I was on medical leave trying to recover from the 8.5 years of harassment. They stole over 1000 pages of documentation of 8.5 years of abuses leaving behind false less damaging documentation. They stalked me using my google account tracking and hacked all of my personal and private e-mails. They paid off a doctor and had me falsely imprisoned in a psyche ward to diagnose someone without prior mental issues as "paranoid schizophrenic" so that everything they've done to me for all of these years would be overlooked. They have emptied every dropbox account that I hold that contained the documentation of what they did to me.

I have a permanent lifetime injury BECAUSE of this organization, and they continue to meddle in my life though I am no longer employed with the company.

Cottage Employees: Protect yourselves. Document the abuses using an execl timeline, and just know that they wlll log on to your pc to delete these logs and you can call ISD to hear that it is an error that they cannot recover. If you have damning e-mails with abuse, PRINT them and make copies and send it to loved ones because once you need the documentation, Cottage Health will stop at nothing to get it from you. That is the truth.

Cottage H. is responsible for 9 horrible years in my life and I've completely lost my health. I have been away from your environment and remain sick because of your bullying illegal tactics. I can bring everything to light and I will as I have evidence from all illegal activities that you have committed against me this year. Leave me alone.<//review>< pics>

The worst emergency room experience ever! I was sent by my pediatrician at 10.30pm as she felt my son was reacting to an injection given at Urgent Care. 5 hours later we are still sitting here to be seen by a dr. The nurse told me he seemed not in stress any more so I can take him home and bring him back the next day or take him to Cottage Santa  Barbara. But they can not advice if I should go or stay. If I was a dr. And knew what to do I would not have brought him in to this place that has nurses who have no bedside manner.

This is Saturday night, how can you not be equipped to handle patients, at one point we heard that it was only 1 dr. On duty. Pathetic and sad. Many patients walked out after waiting for more than 3 hours.<//Review>

<Text>Terrible financial/admin practices! This is the closest emergency room to our house, and I only use it when I have to. The facility is nice, and the staff is wonderful with my kids - I've used it for my kids about 4 times in the past 14 years. But despite the kindness of the onsite staff, each time, their financial department makes errors in billing, sends my bill to old addresses instead of current addresses, and turns amounts over to a really bad credit agency for "collections' before I know about a bill (before I know that insurance pays.) And get this - they are impossible to contact if you haven't received a bill. You can't reach them on the phone, or get into the online system without an invoice number! Crazy. Go to Sansum, and avoid this place. -- Although, they seem to be the only knowledgeable burn center ER in the area.  Please update your administration practices so we can reward your hardworking staff.</Text>< GmapID>

I am astounded by the negative reviews I see about GVCH.  My experience was very good-to-excellent in almost every way -- admissions, surgical prep, recovery, room assistance, PT, food service, nursing care.  I have had many stays in hospital, mostly sports injuries or similar, both in the US and overseas, and my care and treatment at GVCH was the best, overall.</text>

This so call hospital kicked out my sick 84 year old father just 24 hours after he arrived. Two CT scans showed he has a lower spine fracture and a painful bladder infection which he needed to have a catheter inserted. Even though the doctor was in process of submitting an order for my father to remain in the hospital for at least one more day, you transferred him to an after care facility with the catheter still attached. Cottage never spoke to my dad’s doctor regarding his care. Your lack of compassion for your patients is shameful. I guess your administration and the insurance company thought my dad was costing you too much money so you kicked him out!!! For God sake, he had insurance!!! If you don’t actually care for people, should you be called a hospital????< /Review>

Mom had to go there because we could not know what to do ... she has health issues
The Dr who helped us does not know how to sympathize .. his nurse I believe her name started with D was really more investigating  than helping .. they were not compassionate .. they were not helpful and they just wanted us to leave .. what a terrible experience I hope I do not need to go back again.</text>

(Translated by Google) Here they bought a phone, and they put in a guarantee without authorization, then we went to pay the phone payment, and then they cut the line, when the payment had already been given, and they put us in a payment system demanding the payment of the insurance that was never requested, we were told that we had to go before to cancel the insurance we went, and they did not want to cancel, that because the system was not working, after they had already increased $ 10 more to the account, and we went again, and we They said that we had to pay everything, and then they would reimburse everything, that because it had been an employee error, they paid everything, and now they don't want to reimburse anything.

<Review>I've been coming here for years.  The owners are friendly.  The smoothies and drinks are delicious.  I especially love their milk tea with boba (tapioca) and their avocado smoothie.  Their milk tea is made from actual tea and not from powder like a lot of places.  I've referred many people here and they agree that this place is delicious.  They're right next to 24 hour fitness.< /Review>< pics>

Way too expensive!!!  Over $8 for only three fruits... would’ve cost over $12 by the time I added in a few more items to make it how I wanted it. I’ll keep going to Ever Bowl - same size without the up-charge for topping choices. Not to mention, there’s too much ice blended with the açaí making it very bland and watery - definitely not worth the money. Two stars because the girl behind the counter was nice :/<//review>

Juice is awesome! Well made and clean facility. The reason I give three stars is because of the service. I tend to order a juice specifically that takes longer to make because it is fresh squeezed. Every time I walk in I feel like the workers see me as a burden because they don’t want to make this drink. I am only in here a few times a week at the most. I am giving my business and don’t feel appreciated as a customer. They always make a point as well to make my juice after other customers who ordered after me.<//review>

This place has the best 50/50 bar smoothie that i have found. Think its called an orange squeeze. I have been coming here for a long time whenever im in the area and its always good. Its family owned and operated and they are always nice and the prices are good. i hope this place never closes because no one beats them for what I like.<//Review>

Juice Bar has been a staple in my life and family since I was little. This place makes the most delicious and affordable smoothies you'll ever taste. Flavors like mango bango and the chocolate are my favorites. I always enjoy adding on one of their pretzels too. This family ran business is a must on your list of places to try!<//review>

Support local businesses. And still the best acai bowl. Always fresh. The fresh juices are on point. If you feel like a lemonade, but desire a tropical twist - get the passion fruit juice. Not too sweet nor sour. Packed with nutrition!< /review>

I got the Amazon acai bowl and compared to other acai bowls I've tried this was very disappointing. The size of the item itself leads you to think that it'll be filling, but they add in quite a bit of ice into the acai to essentially make it an acai smoothie.

It's very watery, very little acai flavor. The best part of this was the fruit and granola but that's the best part of ANY acai bowl. On top of that it was $8.

The staff are also not very welcoming and you can tell the owners that work here don't like their jobs.

Only rating this two stars because their boba drinks are good (but I haven't been to a boba place that serves bad beverages, really).< /review>

No tangy zip to the flavor and the all but scarce granola felt old and bland. The place I normally go has a real bowl with a healthy serving of acai base, sliced banana, strawberry, blueberry and raspberry, covered in granola, shredded coconut and topped with bee pollen... for about $6 and change after tax. So.... sadly, rethinking my return here.<//Review>< user_name>

This place is good, it has Boba which is a plus, and as far as the Boba goes, it's delicious... not to soft either! Plus they make some of the best smoothies comparable to Jamba Juice.<//Review>

<review>There's something nostalgic about Coco's. I remember going to the one in University City 20 years ago when I was a kid. I went to this location yesterday with my son. We ordered the sirloin steak with loaded mashed potatoes, the spicy Asian chicken salad, the broccoli chicken alfredo with cork screw pasta and a slice of the strawberry cheese pie. All costed about $65.00 including tip and we had leftovers that fed us today for breakfast and lunch. I'll definitely come back again someday.< /review>< gmapID>

They make great pies at this place! Banana creme pie is my favorite. Ample parking at the back of the restaurant, clean place. The only thing that requires attention and improvement is customer service.

When I stepped inside and lined up at their To-Go counter, the staff were both chatting and took 5 minutes before giving me any attention. No greeting when you  come in, no one saying, "I'll be right with you." They are completely aware that you are there, but ignores you. Yeah, I should've walked out of this place.

The couple who were seated at the reception area were baffled at the amount of time it took this place just to have their order done. Slices of pies (2) and a cup of ☕. How long should the staff take to fulfill that order?  20 mins? 30 mins? Ha! I was surprised, too.< /text>

Really disappointing.  Used to love the Chicken Tortilla Soup.  But now its turned into a creamy 3 Bean Soup.  No chicken that I saw.  Could not eat.  They changed the recipe.  Also portions r smaller.  But pies still great...smaller slice though...</text>

<Review>Like many establishments, they've setup outdoor dining. Menu is a code to scan on the table. We enjoyed a couple of new items on the menu. The half rack ribs with shrimp and 2 sides and the half rack ribs with chicken. Sauce had a nice flavor, bit too spicy or too sickly sweet. Meat was "fall off the bone" cooked. Coleslaw was crispy fresh, not too vinegary. Also had fries, and that is where plating issues come in. If you put a bunch of fries on the plate and then a rack of hot, juicy, BBQ ribs on top of them, what's going to happen to fries. The ones underneath are soft and soggy. The coleslaw came in a separate small dish which kept it's juice from spreading out underneath the fries as well.
But overall, it was a very good lunchtime break and I would recommend it.</Review>< Pics>

We have been going to this place since the 90's.  It is the only surviving store at "the grove"... This restaurant serve food similar to Applebee's, Chili's, Denny's etc...  We like dining at Coco's because of the great service and pies.  The generous parking lot is a big plus too.  The night manager, Kendra (who was also our waitress) did a fantastic job taking care of us.  It was a busy day, but she managed to maintain composer and served us and other patrons with a smile.< /text>

Decent food and good variety. The service was ok, but it was late, so I'll give it a pass. Pie is always good here.</text>

<review>This was my first time eating here. It was the best breakfast food I've ever had in a restaurant. They're definitely better than ihop and Denny's by a long shot. It feels homey, the prices are great, the food was delicious, the customer service was on point. Vivian was our server, she did a great job.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOcdSFOk3Oy4fhl8AjC25rV1towuKXRKPYS2Eq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUJPv5r9GD1BQ6hEbzVBP6cWVmW0Czqau3qZRq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

One word: delicious! We had burgers and soup. Omg the tomato soup was the best! Nothing compares! A bit spicy, fresh spices, nice and thick, and didn't have large chunks of tomatoes. Will definitely be returning! Apple chees pie was delicious too. A bit rich and sweet, but good. First time eating from there and not disappointed, a must try!<//Review>

We had a problem waiting for our food and they got my Pastor friend's order wrong but I was fine since I only got coffee. We got compensated though, after he pitched a fit about waiting 45 minutes and still getting it wrong 2 times.  Maybe they just had a bad day?</Review>

<response>None<//response><text>My daughter got sick shortly after drinking the Apple juice at first time at this particular location. I thought maybe it's because we don't drink the brand of juice.....or whatever so I gave it another shot.

In terms of service overall the waitress was polite and timely and the food was brought out with normal decent wait time. In terms of smell upon entering the building: you can tell it's an old building either that or they don't properly wash the mood and towels etc because of the musky smell.

In terms of food I was a little disappointed as I ordered the chicken avocado rolls and saw there was no avocado...apparently it's inside. *you'd be able to taste still if that was the case and in this....it was non existent. The drinks were good and The soup wasn't salty this time. The best part is their bread. I'd say that's the only thing you can't really go wrong with. The macaroni noodles also had Brown on them which proves that the bottom of the pan had to have been burned or overcooked. I also pray that the grey fuzz in the bowl of cheese wasn't mold.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Breakfast was superb! I forgot our server's name but she was definitely hospitable. Reminds me of a Filipino mom that would make sure that you help yourself with food. She was definitely accommodating. One piece of cinnamon roll was definitely enough for two people. It was about the size of my hand. I also ordered smoked gouda and gash omelette. The side of potatoes were definitely flavorful! Add some cholula on these babies and you'll definitely fall in love with this!<//text>< Pictures>

<rate>2</rate><Review>Any fast food chain burger tastes better than burgers from this place. Ordered food online, specifically cheeseburgers with bacon and a side of salad - we received burgers with no bacon, they didn't taste like they were flame grilled, and dressing for salad was not what I ordered. Bad experience, especially on our cheat day, which happens once in awhile. My husband and I, we both are very disappointed.<//Review>< pictures>

Buy be aware when you pay your bill because one of the waitress always write on your bill the tip she wants, so if you leave the tip on the table you will get charged again at the counter
On this bill the waitress add  aprox $60.00 plus $40.00 cash (That we left on the table) I noticed that until I got my credit card statement, I guess it was too late to do something about it.<//Text>< Rate>

I have gone to this restaurant for quite sometime. Since I haven't been there in awhile I decided to order food today. Wrong idea. The baked potato was old and hard as a rock. The steak was a little tuff. The strawberry pie was awful, it had a crust that appeared to have been added and not baked together.
So I give today 2 and half stars.</Text>

Coco's has updated its menu again. There is a large selection of food choices. I had a melted cheese sandwich with a small salad and a cup of tortilla soup and it was very good. The prices are reasonable and the service was good.</Text>

<Review>Very upset with the service I received that day.. The waitress was nice but the food took forever to come and we still never got our complete order. All I ordered was oatmeal 2 sausage links and 2 pieces of toast... The only thing I got was my sausage they kept telling me my oatmeal and  Toast was on its way. My son ordered oatmeal and fruit..all he got was fruit, my friend ordered Eggs and toast..all she got was the eggs.  The only 2 orders that came out right but took for ever was the :) pancake and the hamburger. We sat for an hour waiting for food that should have taken less than 30 minutes. The restaurant was not overcrowded And I wasn't in a rush when we went in but I did have something to do that day.  I've been in this Coco's before and they are usually pretty good... The waitress kept telling us I don't work at this one I usually work at Denny's. I may go back but this won't be my 1st choice.</Review>< pics>

<review>I ordered food for my wife and it never showed up. Cocos hired door dash and the driver never answered the call. I called the restaurant on mothers day several times and tried to call back in the evening. No one answers. I called today a day later and still no answer. I never got my order and was still charged for it. This is extremely unacceptable I do not have time being in the military has me busy as can be. I hope to get my money back. I tried everything possible and no one answers.</review>< Resp>

I ordered Two Harvest pies because that is my familes favorite and I always give one of them and then I keep one for myself and don't think that the minute that I got into my car I did not open up one of those pies and had a couple bites.

Completely rude and ignorant hostess! Not worth the gas it took me to drive there to deal with that type of customer service! Usually I can look passed poor customer service as maybe someone having something going on in their life, but this woman was down right rude and unapologetic for no reason.</text>

Nice. Decent quality food. Good service. Clean. Not decrepit like some diners, but could use a mordern-style touch up, but that's not even needed, more of a preference, really.<//review>

<text>Had a decent experience here. Great service. Food came out pretty quickly. The prices were resonable also. Been to a few of these restaurants before, but I feel that they have been pretty consistent over the years. So that's a good thing. You don't see many commercials about this and restaurant, they really should advertise more, then maybe they would have more business. Still Happy with the meal, so that's what is important.<//text>< user>

We like to go here for a quick meal. I usually get the Sante Fe Trio. It comes with a salad, soup and quiche. I like the chicken tortilla soup. The staff is usually very friendly and helpful. We tend to go when it's not too busy so we don't have to wait to be seated or served.<//review>

I had Belgian waffles, two eggs and two strip of bacon. They're okay. I really wanted crepes but they didn't have it. It was worth coming here because Coco's isn't busy like IHOP, especially on Sundays.</review>

<date>1558407373358<//date><rate>1< /rate><Text>Came here to have brunch with my two young daughters, we got seated right away. We were glad to see it wasn’t busy at all. The hostess told us our waiter would be with us soon and we waited for 30 mins and no one ever came. for someone to come attend us. A waitress came and served the table behind us and not once did she come and ask us for our drinks or offer any type of service. At one point I got up and took my little one to the bathroom, when I got back I noticed all the workers were just chit-chatting away behind the counter not servicing anyone. I went back to my table and told my daughter to grab their things so we could leave. This was the worst service ever. Never coming back here again.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>I ate here a few times about 10 years ago. And then I stopped going for no particular reason. Today, I was in the area with my son and decided to swing in.

The hostess wanted to sit us between two occupied booths even though many of the tables were empty. I had to suggest a different table so my son and I, as well as the other diners could have a little privacy.

The food was ok. The blue cheese was weak and a little vinegary. Like the took a bottle and watered it down. My club was made with stale bread. It was supposed to be toast, not crouton like hardness.

Service was ok. Was going to have pie while we were there, but the other food killed my appetite.  I love the pie. But I like it at Marie Calendars too.</text><gmapID>0x80d956cba9642e25:0x7cecc8c65a7e707c</gmapID><Time>1556161939835< /Time>< pictures>

Most of the staff are friendly. They seem to get overwhelmed once the restaurant becomes busy.     But, the good is good and wait times for refills of beverages are a little long.<//text>

<Date>1549704603868< /Date><Review>I wasn't really all that impressed. My fiance and I had dinner there. We both ordered prime rib. Both of our prime ribs were more fat than meat. It wasn't very good. I had mashed potatoes that were barely warm and the portion very small. Even the vegetables were not hot. Overall the dinner left alot to be desired. So I didn't want to take a chance on any pie. It was very disappointing for the price they are charging. Shameful.< /Review><Response>None< /Response></record>

<Review>Easy Parking. Clean lobby. Lots of available seating (weekday lunch). Lunch entrees range from $9 to $12 (and then more for seafood and steaks). Service could have been more enthusiastic / faster. Food (mushroom and swiss prime rib hamburger) was hot and tasted good. Ordered a pie to go (Coconut Cream) and had some immediately at home. It was delicious. I am giving 3.5 stars because it's what you would expect at a restaurant. Certainly not bad (1-star) and nothing to write to Mom about (5-stars).< /Review><UserId.>101357089882070703342<//UserId.></record>

Coco's is always been a good place to eat with good food and most of the time good service however it's going on the day I visited the waitress slow drag the order slow drag even sharing Us in bringing any kind of drinks and then really slow drag the check at the end well I go back the phone is good so maybe not definitely have a different waitress the place is handicap accessible it also has handicap parking right out front is chanel from the never wheelchair on the inside not a problem the food is terrific I just hope the service next time will be better!<//Review>

<Review>I used to go here a lot with my family. Then I saw a huge rat sitting right outside of the restaurant. This thing was sitting beside a pipe that lead into the restaurant. I was so disgusted my entire hungry family left. We have tried to give this place a chance so many more times after that but every time we just end up walking out. The place always smells like heavy duty carpet cleaner and it invades your nose the second you walk in. I will never go to this disgusting place and for your own safety and health I recommend you don't either.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Coco's is always been a good place to eat with good food and most of the time good service however it's going on the day I visited the waitress slow drag the order slow drag even sharing Us in bringing any kind of drinks and then really slow drag the check at the end well I go back the phone is good so maybe not definitely have a different waitress the place is handicap accessible it also has handicap parking right out front is chanel from the never wheelchair on the inside not a problem the food is terrific I just hope the service next time will be better!</text>

<Text>They need a whole lot of improvement there's only one or two good servers the rest of them not so much they don't give U bread until after 11:30 before back in the days whenever you showed up at Coco's you would just like Mimi's. It'll be automatic .you will get your basket of bread.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Waited 10 minutes for them to even take our drink order than the server walks by like I'll be right with you while filling everyone else's water and coffee around us .... I've been a server since I was 15 .. you dont fill others drinks when one table has been sitting for 10 minutes and hasnt even gotten water and you guys are not even busy in the slightest . Work on that please . Food is slightly below average to me got the Benedict.... also dont get the fruit unless you only want cantaloupe because that's all they have .<//text>

Wow!! What a big disappointment.....This place is so under staff in the entire restaurant....The kitchen needs more cooks...Clearly there are not enough waiters & servers...it's just a mess in there....It's so sad....There is a section on the left that is always empty because they never have enough employees to cover it??? How do you run a business like this??..The lobby is packed full.....I see customers walking out the door....I wonder if management even knows??....Nobody seems to care anymore...This restaurant is in such a great location so they really have a captive audience here....Too bad the place is run so poorly.....I won't go in anymore...& I tell my friends, clients, neighbors & co-workers don't waste your time going into Coco's anymore....Check your numbers people, sales must be down & this is why!!!< /review>

We waited 25 minutes for our order and nobody was here.  I dont know what took so long. Customer service was bad. They seemed to have an attitude and somewhat sarcastic. Floors were dirty and over all the experience i had was not good. Sorry cant recommend.< /text>

<UserId.>110851629200045562039< /UserId.><text>Overpriced for the quality of food.  Had the hash browns....ok, well I ordered the hash browns.  their idea of hash browns is home fries.  nothing wrong with home fries but they are not even CLOSE to being hash browns.  Food was just mediocre, and not worth the inflated price they charge.  Waitress took our drink order and while she was gone to get drinks, a waiter came and was taking our food order.  Waitress comes back and snaps at waiter "this is my table"....ok, if he is poaching the table for sure say something but not right in front of the customers.  I'm sure it was an honest mistake.
I'd never been to a coco's before, and need to never try them again.  Just too mediocre and there are many amazing options elsewhere.
I didn't try their pies, but they had a "strawberry pie" that, i kid you not, was a pie crust with strawberries in it, and probably some strawberry sauce dribbled on it, not an actual pie.  Kind of made me laugh (just commenting on this, the pie that i did not try did not affect my star rating).<//text><user_name>Sara Brown</user_name><Rating>2<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

I use to go to the Coco's in La Mesa all the time, it was wonderful! Unfortunately they closed 2 years ago and I am forced to come here. I usually like them but I had a poor experience on Thanksgiving.

I called to see if they were doing slices of pie because, my mom was in the hospital for the holiday unexpectedly and that was all she wanted and I had already driven around town. Apparently pie is some huge secret because, Katie could not tell me what pies they had. I did the drive all the way down to Coco's from the hospital in Mission Valley only to find out they didn't even make the pie I was looking for. I had told Katie my situation on the phone, I didn't want to make a drive for a pie that didn't exist. She made it seem as if this pie was there. Once I talked to her again and told her what was going on she said, "aww poor baby." very sarcastically, insincere and dismissive. I wanted to cry because, it's just my mom and I living here in San Diego and I'm just a kid trying to manage all of this and give my mom a holiday meal while she's in the hospital.

Once I got into the back area where they were distributing pies (I figured I'd just buy a whole pie, take a slice and give the rest away). They didn't have much left by noon but told me to come back in 4 hours, that's a sick joke. I did talk to a nice woman working and told her my story and she was so sweet about the situation and made recommendations. Miraculously the slice of pie that KATIE told me didn't exist showed up! I appreciated the lady who helped me and another gentleman (guest) for helping me out but I felt that Katie was playing with people's emotions and I didn't appreciate it whatsoever.

Not surprised by Katie's dismissive attitude because, I witnessed her one time saying something explicit to a cook in Spanish. She even admitted it and asked if I spoke Spanish and heard her.</review>

Worst experience ever . . . Disgusting Place! Waited forever to be seated, then no one waited on our table. My daughter is 5 years old and I will guarantee you she will never eat at a Coco's for the rest of her life. People walked by us like we were invisible.</Text>

Server Guliana never check on us until after we had finished our meal. I asked for a coffee refill.... Never got it. When I mentioned it to her, she offered to get it then. No apology was offered. We had to seat ourselves as well. The server also ignored my elderly mothers requests for an explanation of the menu. I had to call her back to get the service due to us as customers. Qhen I asked where something was on the menu.. "sides", she told me the heading on the menu; I was already looking at it. I asked her to find it for me. She couldnt. It wasnt
there. No apology offered. We have been served by her many times; but this experience waa BY FAR the worst. She was smug, unfriendly, and distant. Never got a sincere greeting. Appeared to be under stress. Professional or personal. Either way... Hospitality demands better.< /text>< pics>

The staff supporting the customers here work their rear off running back and forth from that kitchen, keeping that food fresh when it comes to your table, and if theres a problem, their on top of it with a friendly and courteous manager backing them, and ensuring people leave with a smile!</text>< Pictures>

There is a horribly foul smell throughout the entire restaurant like bad plumbing. It gets noticeably worse when approaching the bathroom. From other reviews it appears to be a documented problem that they are unwilling or unable to fix. Real shame as it's the only location left in SD.</text>

(Translated by Google) This is usually a very friendly restaurant
But today when we arrived and checked in, the boy who attended us was very kind and told us that there was a waiting line. We sat down to wait and a girl Maritza without saying good afternoon! Hi! Or an excuse me. She was very rude and told us to get out and wait outside. Very unpleasant and poor customer service from this girl.

(Original)
Este suele ser un restaurante  muy amable
Pero hoy al llegar y checarnos el muchacho que nos atendio fue muy amable y nos dijo que había línea de espera. Nos sentamos a esperar y una muchacha Maritza sin decir buenas tardes! Hola! O un disculpen. Fue muy ruda y nos dijo deben salirse y esperar afuera. Muy Desagradable y pobre el servicio a cliente de esta muchacha.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The food was very tasty. But they took time to serve us and serve us. Asta I had to get up for our coffees at the counter. But otherwise the place was clean and quiet.

La comida estuvo muy rica. Pero tardaron en atendernos y en servirnos. Asta me tuve que levantar por nuestros cafés al mostrador. Pero en lo demás estuvo limpio y tranquilo el lugar.<//text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The price is accessible. But the service is appalling. I went to eat in an hour of little clientele. For the waitress to arrive, we wait 20 minutes. The food took 1 hour to arrive and it was cold.

El precio es accesible. Pero el servicio es pésimo. Fui a comer en una hora de poca clientela.  Para que llegara la mesera esperamos 20 minutos.

<Text>(Translated by Google) I went to dinner with my husband and the waitress was flirting with him as if I didn't exist ... I ordered lemonade and the others put it on the table and I was in the corner away from me ... When I went to pay I left a note In which it said: zero tip for flirting with my husband.
That waitress was also the cashier .. I'm sure she read my note and I hope that next time she will be respectful.

(Original)
Fui a cenar con mi esposo y la mesera estaba coqueteando con el como si yo no existiera... Pedí limonada y a los demás se la puso en la mesa y ami en la esquina lejos de mi ... Cuando fui a pagar deje una nota en la que decía: zero propina por coquetear con mi marido.
Esa mesera era también la cajera.. Estoy segura que ella leyó mi nota y espero que la próxima vez sea respetuosa.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>
