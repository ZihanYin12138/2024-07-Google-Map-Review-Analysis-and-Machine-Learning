We have been ordering from this location for 20+ years.
Everything we have ever ordered has been just wonderful.
We started ordering a supreme pizza with extra sausage and beef, and now trying extra mushrooms on half. I’m sure it will be just mouthwatering delicious 😋
Cant go wrong ethos place.
I would give them 10 ⭐️ Stars if I could.< /review>

<text>I ordered a pepperoni pizza 16in. It was okay not the best. Definitely affordable place to order from and size is decent. I think maybe a little more sauce and salt. Other than that it was just okay.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I've seen this little place on Federal Blvd for years and finally stopped by. Delicious pizza! Great deal on a large 3 topping. Saw another Bambinos up on Paradise Valley Rd too. And they have more than just pizza. Gyros, deli sandwiches, salads. Definitely worth checking them out. I was totally satisfied.< /Text>

<text>I won't be returning. I'm very particular about my pizza and I wasn't that pleased with this one. Sorry. Hate to give a bad review but just being honest. Always room for improvement and they definitely need to improve. The packaging and everything was good the pizza was something I wouldn't try again</text>< Response>

The topping application could use a little work, but the dough tasted nice and fresh, the cheese was gooey, and the overall taste was delicious. The salad was good too. Nice fresh crispy lettuce and veggies. The house sauce is pretty decent too. I was also able to switch sodas for the ones they didn't have so that was cool too. First time customer, and maybe a regular in the future. :D<//Review>

<Text>Pizza is awful. Greasy and doughy made with noticeably cheap ingredients. I should have known better when saw they spelled pizzeria wrong. The fact that they have 3 locations makes me further lose hope in humanity. Honestly feel bad even giving the 90% uneaten pizza to my dogs. The girl at the front is nice and works hard but otherwise this place is pure trash.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80d9514f21fdcb53:0xf851bd6350710803</Gmap_id></record>

They were practicing Covid  guidelines asking people after they order to please wait out side. They just seem like they got it together over there.

<text>Honestly my wife and I were excited to try out this place after reading all the good reviews. I wish I could have also left a good review. I'm a big fan of the Philly cheese steak. I've had it from different restaurants. When I got home and was ready to eat my sandwich I felt as if I took a bite of a table salt sandwich it was super salty and the calzone was also salty. So sad, I really wanted to keep coming here since I live close by.</text>< Pics>

<review>This is the worst pizza we have ever received from Banbino's.
My husband and I have been coming here for 3 plus years and we have never had a pizza that is this greasy as well as falling off the crust like this one. I can only hope that it is an  ingredient issue (cheap ingredients) or the chef is new but this is not the product I have ever expected for this company.</review>< rating>

The best pizza in downtown San Diego. I was introduced this place by a friend and whenever I am in this area, we order the largest buffalo chicken pizza. This taste is on point. For a very small location, they have a few great selections.I recommend this location to everyone.<//review>

<Text>Bambinos's deserves more exposure!

The pizza is beyond delicious, the crust is fluffy and fresh, you don't get skimped on the toppings, and every. single. time I order it consistently amazing.

The draw back is that I love their pizza so much, I don't want to have anything but the pizza! I've had the jalapeño poppers and they are fresh and tasty too but beyond that I haven't adventured out.

We usually have it delivered and the staff are super kind and friendly too!< /Text>< rating>

<Text>This is our favorite pizza! Friendly folk, great pizza at a great price. Along with the kid's fav, pepperoni, we love the Greek pizza with gyro meat, red onions, and feta cheese, delicious!!
FYI, it's take out or delivery only</Text>< user_id>

<Text>Love this place! Yousef is always super friendly when I come in. The pizza is always done when they say it will be and tastes great! The dough has a dash of sweet but works so well with all their pizza. I've only ever had the pizza but I love it and can tell they care about their shop. Thanks for killing it guys, never stop. And don't listen to the haters.</Text>< user>

I have called on three different occasions in the last year or so, and literally every time I call I cannot understand a dang word they say. Not a word, and honestly I have an ear for accents. I've yet to successfully order a pizza. Which is sad because the coupons are good and I've liked giant pizza kings elsewhere. Tried just now, and was excited to use a coupon and get a good deal. I'm really bummed out.< /review>

<Text>SO thrilled that we finally have an amazing pizza place in the neighborhood! Not only is the pizza wonderful, the staff is incredibly friendly! Yousef and his co-workers always greet us with a smile and even if its a chaotic weekend night, we never feel rushed when trying to figure out what we want. So lets talk food: the pizza, SO GOOD and the prices can't be beat. They have some amazing carry-out specials and they don't skip on toppings! On our very first visit we got the Pesto Sauce Pizza and we were hooked after that. I was also excited to see they have a chicken cheese steak, which was also delicious!  Keep up the great work you guys! You have a customer for life!< /Text><userid>117225463927677320491</userid><gmap_id>0x80d9514f21fdcb53:0xf851bd6350710803<//gmap_id><time>1515723699101< /time>< resp>

But now the new owners barley put anything on the pizza. Also the pizza price is ridiculous, YOU ARE BETTER OFF EATING AT LITTLE CAESARS PIZZA LOL.  This place is overpriced and the pizza is not what it used to be. Also the offer specials, but the specials aren't so special. Also their x-large pizzas look like a medium sized pizza.

<Review>Guy was super rude when I called I ordered 2 16" pizzas for 6 people I told him they wouldn't give me more than two Parmesan packets after I asked twice the deal came with a liter of cola all they had was Pepsi so I said can you just not charge me for the Pepsi I don't drink Pepsi and he said yes and proceeds to ring me up for the exact price. Pizza is super greasy and the ranch dressing taste like they milked there goat in the back and made ranch it was terrible.</Review><UserId.>111832725297272043439</UserId.><gmapID>0x80d9514f21fdcb53:0xf851bd6350710803< /gmapID><Rating>1<//Rating>< pictures>

<text>The best tasting freshly baked pizza in town! They serve it piping hot right out of the oven. They are generous with the cheese so the pizza is cheesey, the crust is perfectly baked with just the right amount of sweetness and each slice has a lot of Pepperoni on it! Their French fries are the big and thick ridged ones they serve with a lot of seasoning! We arrived at 9:30pm and the place was newly cleaned. They raised their 12" inch one topping pizza by a dollar to $6.95 but in today's economy, it's still an excellent deal considering the quality of their Pizzas and welcoming family run type service!<//text>< pictures>

Yummy pizza. Nice staff. NO PARKING for pick up - you just have to hope for a spot on the curb. Kind of precarious traffic area.<//text>

I had to order a huge amount of pizza for an office function.  I ordered from another place ahead of time and they screwed me over at the last minute.  Called this place and they had 8 of those massive pizzas ready in about 45 minutes.  And at a decent price. They saved the day!  And the pizza was damn good too.<//review>

If you tip, make sure to do so once they are at your door. If you tip beforehand online they tend to not deliver to your door but make you go to the street. Fries were really soggy and chicken was dry. Good pizza though and lasagnia was as well.<//text>

This pizza is really good and not expensive.  I stopped in after work, ordered, and it was ready very fast.  The dude with the beard was very nice.< /Text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>Pizza was cold and soda was warm. 45 mins late. Owner Joe gave me a credit to fix it. When i called back two days later, a VERY rude employee named Sam hung up in my face when asking about my credit. I called back and he proceeded to tell me I hung up on him when i clearly heard his phone slam in my face. Very unprofessional and now will wait until the owner is around to tell him about the people representing his business. Won't be giving my business to them ANYMORE.</text>< pictures>

< Review>
I was not aware of this location until just the other day. And I've passed thru this area frequently, guess cuz I've never really looked for a food spot along that road til that day! Anyways it's a lil more pricier than the one at PH but quality is still there. Also different family. I thought their $5 pizza would be the same as the one at PH, but it wasn't. At Ph it's a 14" 1 topping for $5 theirs is a 10" for $5. All in all I'd still go here again only bcuz the quality of their food.<//Review>

< Review>
Neighborhood pizzeria with good selection of food, value and customer service. I recommend CALLING your order in though because from past experience, they always seem to make mistakes when you use the online ordering apps like “Slice.” For example, TWICE now, I’ve ordered chicken Phillies and received steak Phillies. Also more than once, I’ve opted to add on fries for +$1 and have gotten stiffed on 2 out of the 3 entrees’ fries. They’re an old-school family operation, so just stick with the old-school and CALL your order in and you should be good to go!</Review>

The pizza is a big improvement from the former pizza restaurant. The Calzone is alright its just has a little too much grease for me. As far as everything else on the menu I have no complaints, it’s pretty good and its all handmade!< /text>

<Review>First, they've been in business at this location less than 90 days, any reviews prior to that are for Giant Pizza King, a company that was convenient, but more in the way of "Okay, since I dont have to drive more than 30 seconds to get food, i'll tolerate orders that aren't quite correct"

Since the new shop opened up, we've tried their Pizzas, Antipasto Salads, and Calzones,   I used to have to drive 15 miles round trip for these, but with this new shop, it is literally less than 500 feet away.

I host a shindig every other weekend, and every single time we've ordered, everyone who ate was pretty satisfied.   They definitely know their trade.

Here's hoping they stay here indefinitely.<//Review>< pics>

Great friendly little bar on base. They have free pizza during "happy hour". I my case it was not free. It was the first place I found after arriving on a Space A flight and checking into my room. Don't be a rookie like me and walk in with a baseball cap (hat) or you will hear cheers and a bell ring. Next thing you know your buying a round for the bar. Thankfully, when I entered only four people where at the bar. The round was $32.00 with tip. Four new friends, great conversation and several slices of pizza (to try to make up for the loss).

They also have rules against putting a cell phone on the bar (almost got me on that one also) & touching any of the model aircraft hanging from the ceiling so be careful.

Hey, I am retired Air Force what do I know about crazy Navy rules. It was all good.<//text>

<Review>This on base bar/club is a hidden gem.  We had a great command outing and I enjoyed a solo visit once before as well.  The staff are very friendly and accommodating.  Just be certain to read the rules or you may find yourself buying a round for the room!< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIC0e17zCuloyQRwejlR_ZnWnU_u83l1HLRx3R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3I8kYYKEQOfE0W8HEHPHQmLaUkSfN5DFFUHxi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsUAqtNDvMuu_Axa4xVM6mKocBEoOb50hECM9k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80deac99d4f66061:0x12985bd97473f18f</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

AMAZING! Our last stop for the night, with our whole wardroom, it was a total blast!!! The bartender handled all of our orders and the whole group very well, despite an extremely rowdy dice game! Full of history from all the aviators who have gone before us, it was the best way to celebrate together and not have to deal with the drama of rides and driving on base... We all simply walked back to our lodging after the night was over!!!<//text>

<text>I'd give it 5 stars but I had to buy a round for having my cell phone on the bar just as I was closing out.  Lol.  Great place with great history!< /text>< GmapID>

We took my niece here and she absolutely loved it. There is so much to see and on a nice day, it's well worth the trek. Luckily, for us, the weather was clear so it made this visit much more fun.

I really liked seeing the bears, penguins and koalas. We didn't pet any animals in the petting zoo. The peacocks are gorgeous.< /Review>

We had a great time at the reptacular ranch! We used swimply.com to rent the pool with hot tub and slide. Loved it! It was great to swim and soak on a hot day (we don’t have our own pool). We got a private guided tour of the ranch and got to learn about a lot of interesting animals. Snakes, birds, camels, llamas, sheep, goats, rabbits and more. The kids loved it!<//Text>

We love Reptacular Ranch! The moment we did our first site visit of the venue we knew it was our wedding venue. Diana was so helpful every time we stopped by to plan things here and there. Cory was always open to quick communication and answering any questions we had. He also put our minds at ease if we had any concerns about anything - and I mean ANYTHING.

The day of it ended up being a little cloudy with some drizzle, but the Ranch still looked beautiful! We utilized the full space, adding some animal experiences along with the petting zoo and our guests loved that there was so much to do during cocktail hour.

This place is a hidden gem and we would choose it all over again in a heartbeat. Thank you to the entire Reptacular Ranch team for making our wedding day so very special!</text>

Tons of animals .. exhibits and cardio.  Its along Ocean beach so the weather is always perfect ... dress in layers.

Tons of animals...many exhibits have great views of animals...

Downfall:: parking and to thoroughly enjoy the actual animals here you kind of need to get to them during feeding if not many are sleeping some place hidden.

We always come when they open so we get the zoo lot... its $12 and you pay whrn you purchase your tickets.<//Text>< username>

I got married here. It was an ok place. Fair price, but I didn't find the staff particularly helpful or kind. They were not honest about how easy it is to get Ubers there. No Lyft/Uber drivers wanted to come up the hill and it was a logistical boondoggle after the wedding.<//Text>

<review>Lemos Farm is a year-round family-run children's play farm located in the rural section of Half Moon Bay along scenic San Mateo Rd (aka Hwy92). This place is very popular and can get super-busy at anytime but especially during weekends and holidays; I'd suggest going during the week or get there early and gird your loins for kidsanity! As I stated earlier Lemos Farm is open all year, but we've only visited during the Halloween/Pumpkin season, so this review will cover that season only.</review>< Pics>

Not only do they have a huge selection of pumpkins but the train ride and pony ride are popular. Always go EARLY because the traffic is horrible. Today (10/4/15) we left SF at 945am and was still stuck on 92 for 45 minutes- from 92, the farm is only 5 miles away. If you dare attempt to go later in the day, Im referring to the weekends of course, be prepared to be in traffic for 2-3 hours.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80c29296c4c4c821:0xe3becfc8d3fe62c6< /Gmap_id><response>None</response></record>

Laid-back class that gives you lots of time to pet goats in between poses and even choose to have a goat on your back (the staff walks around and checks if you're okay with it). There's other animals too (pigs, ducks, and bunnies in a fenced off area in the corner).</text>

<text>Cory, Jen and the staff were amazing to work with and super helpful throughout the planning process. The venue is naturally beautiful in the mountains and surrounded by animal life (both wild and domesticated). If you are looking for a beautiful space that is also economical for the LA area, this is the venue for you!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>We booked our wedding here. We loved the location and the venue for a good price. We paid to use the trailers to get ready, the day of our wedding I arrived at 9 when it said it would be ready. I waited 28 MINUTES FOR THEM TO CLEAN! I was there and they knew I was with my bridesmaids and makeup artist... waiting! The trailers were not cleaned very good there was hair in the groom trailer sink and the bride trailer bathroom smelled REALLY BAD. There was also a sign on both trailers to not leave any trash or you will loose your security deposit, WHAT IS THE POINT OF PAYING FOR CLEANING WHEN I HAD TO CLEAN MYSELF. When my  coordinator and family arrived at 9 there was bees EVERYWHERE, the entire bar section was sticky and dirty! My own mom had to grab the hose and clean it herself. The workers that worked there were meant to be professional and they were nothing close to that. They wore sweaters and messy buns they did not help my guest with parking and THEY TOOK OUR PARKING SPOTS that were said to be reserved. They were too lazy to park elsewhere and told my husband THE GROOM to park on the other side, and when he said He was the groom the told him to park by the tree because there was no more parking.... this is nonsense! The security guard did not even say hi or tell me what he was there for. He walked around just starring at me that morning and then later at the venue walked around again didnt say hi when we said hi or told us who he was, was hitting on my bartender and was unprofessional. The fire pit we paid like $150 for was not even lit up I till we told them what are the doing it is cold turn it on. The fire was supper low and the wood looked old they never put more or anything. Its a beautiful venue but I will not recommend it to anyone after I was stressing out as a bride.<//review></record></dataset><record>

The do only provide the venue and the staff to maintain order of the venue (petting zoo too!) so all of our vendors were from "outside" the reptacular family, but they all worked really well with each other. I'm so glad we had our wedding here, we had the most amazing time. Also, Corey and Jen are great people to work with, most positive people I have met. Even with the fires that ran through their property last year they never stopped trying to make a beautiful place for other people to enjoy. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to throw an event or have a petting zoo.</Text>< Pictures>

Attended a wedding held at Reptacular Ranch. It's hard to believe that you are only 15 minutes from San Fernando Valley. Dress appropriately, no high heels for the Ladies; the ground is uneven wood chips and dirt.</review>

< review>
Before I get into my comment, let me state that I have event planning and catering experience. I really like your venue and there is great potential for your future success! Hopefully this will help...
I attended a wedding on Friday May 4th, 2018. I'm always open to new venues and was looking forward to the experience. It is unfortunate the fire burned most of your property, and rebuilding is a tremendous expense.... BUT that doesn't excuse a lack of awareness from your staff!
The ceremony started at 4pm in the blazing sun, so we sat in the back row with our umbrella not to obstruct anyones view. Unfortunately we could NOT hear a word the bride and groom had to say, BUT we heard EVERY word of the employees setting up food and drink down behind us, as well as them throwing stuff around! PLEASE be aware of this factor... Sound travels up!
When my friends and I wanted to go down to the petting area, it was closed!! No sign or anyone to tell us how long the petting area was open. It was disappointing!
No one let us know the buffet was open and no one was there to tell us what was being offered.
Your bartenders were on their game and didn't skip a beat, but there were several woman who mostly sat around and visibly could careless!
Obviously, I am not aware of your agreement with the bride and groom, but nevertheless, this is the time to REALLY step it up to entice future business.
Hope this helps and Good Luck in the future!<//review>

My son's wedding was held on 6/22/18. The ceremony was at 5:30 and the party went on until very late into the night.
Ranch staff is amazing!! I can't say enough about how accommodating they were to us prior to the wedding and the day of.

Food: A fun food truck or trucks would be ideal. The ranch currently does not have anywhere to cook or prepare foods. Caterers hired must have outdoor kitchen that they bring with them and they should be highly experienced in outdoor cooking with no sink, cooking source or refrigeration. This is very important for you to note and find solutions to safe eating for your guests. I wish I could have convinced my son to do this but they were set to go with a caterer who did not have this experience.

Venue:  it's simply beautiful. Very rustic and open. The lighting at night is very nice and the tree's light up, its magical.
The owners just added a vineyard. I was disappointed that nothing was growing on it yet, but in a few months it is going to be amazing. They seem to be constantly working on improvements. They planted flower boxes going down the bride path and it would have been nice if they planted white flowers or lavender would be best so it ties with most weddings.
The seat area where guest sit need sails or something to shade guest. They set up four umbrellas and guest tried squeezing under them. I recommend bride party purchase nice shade umbrellas for all guests until this is resolved or trees grow.

Weather: it gets hot, it was 90 degrees and I was very concerned about the flowers. Florist need to know that the flowers of set up to early, will be in full sun.
It starts to cool down in the evening and you will need a light sweater. My son rented 6 heaters which I felt were unnecessary. They were not used and it was a waste of money. There is also a firepit and lots of folks hung out there and made smores.
Do not drink and drive! We provided uber rides to guests and a couple took advantage of it.

Overall it was beautiful.</text>

{'time': 1506054944901, 'text': 'What does your review even mean? Our pictures are from REAL events and weddings, and MOST of the pictures were taken with Phones, and not photo shopped. Can you please explain your post? Did you come for a tour? Did you come with a wedding party? What about our beautiful pictures of the national forest did you not see when you visited? I would agree that in the Spring season, it is much more green with grass than in the Summer, because all the grass dies off in the hot summer days, yet we normally have a nice cool breeze in the summer, so we are usually around 10-12 degrees cooler than the SFV, SCV, and LA areas. So I ask you again please James Wilson, what did you see online, and what did you experience in person, to create this opinion of yours? Thank you for your time and feedback. Have a great day! :)'}< /Response>

<text>Spent almost $100 for terrible service, waiting over an hour (keep in mind there was only two other couples waiting inside), and okay sushi. The rolls are tiny and eh in flavor. If they tell you it’s a 20 minute wait expect to be there over an hour. You’re money is better off at another local sushi place. WORST SUSHI PLACE IN ANTIOCH, OAKLEY, & BRENTWOOD!

(Also this place used to be an Indian restaurant that was actually pretty good. Inside you can see their previous decor revolving Indian cuisine. DON’T BELIEVE THEIR DELICIOUS LOOKING POSTERS OUTSIDE, IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THIS!)<//text>< username>

<Rate>2</Rate><Text>I got the beef bento box and got my girlfriend the dragon roll. The beef in the bento box tasted oily and greasy. I didn't like the California roll part either. The salad in the bento was good, the fried shrimp tasted like crunchy Styrofoam, and the fried dumplings were good but too small. My girlfriend said the dragon roll was "Decent but not good, lets not go again." Overall we didn't like the food.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPatL9Snce1C_chjYIRmozRAI1IQr_-sPZp2tbd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4rdBF76QH5_RdkOLt_WIshTUyCcR4e41SExtz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

<Review>First time stopping by while driving my wife to work! And I am amazed how FRESH that food ended up being when I took that first bite! I ordered the Beef & Shrimp. I didn't want the rice, but there was no option to replace with more vegetables. But that's okay. As soon as I took that first bite, I ended up burning my lip. BUT THAT WAS OKAY because I realized how FRESH that food was cooked. I recommend this to those who like food that just came from Pan to Plate!<//Review><user_name>Carmichael Garde Jr</user_name>< date>

Great food and even better service. A hidden gem in Brentwood of classic Asian cuisines. The food was nicely presented and tasted great. Prices aren't super cheap but you get quality for your money. Was made to feel very welcome by the servers!</text>

The place requires you to wear a mask and vice versa the staff are wearing them too. When you go inside to order your food, they’re definitely social distancing! The staff wear friendly. It was a little loud inside the restaurant so the girl at the counter could barely hear me, I had to speak louder. Of course, I was also wearing a mask.

The food: I was really craving for sushi so we ordered Two sushi rolls one with salmon (Res Bull) and one with tuna (Rock n Roll): they were ok, the rice on the roll seemed over cooked. We also ordered Tempura Shrimp and Chicken and Terriyaki Chicken. The tempuras were very greasy and not much shrimp meat.

This spot was ok not one of my favorites. But it hit the spot!!!<//text>

I would give this place 2 1/2 stars. Ordered Salmon Love roll. The portions was good the roll was dry. The Salmon sashimi slices starting to get old. I ordered vegetables Tempura and got only sweet and sour sauce. I got a Mango milk tea it looked small 12-16 oz.< /Text>

last night was our first time we came to that excellent restaurant. But It is definitely not the last. We enjoyed the evening very much with the attentive service, with the great  cuisine and wine and with the decent pay. We will surely go back there again.</text>

just tried this place for lunch and am very happy that I did. We enjoyed the Lion King and Rock n Roll rolls as well as the small octopus appetizer. Everything tasted fresh and very yummy. 4 starts as they didn't give me much wasabi and my salmon skin handroll was just a salmon handroll. Not what I ordered but still very good.<//text>

We went for lunch after fruit picking in Brentwood - service was prompt and friendly and the food was good. They offer mild, medium, and spicy levels for spice, so make sure to pick what works for you. Menu is quite extensive and has several vegetarian and non-veg options. I ordered coconut shrimp curry and the shrimp was fresh and cooked to perfection. Overall, five stars!<//Review>

Such a wonderful place to eat and relax. Food is incredible, you ask for what you get too! I enjoy my meals HOT! And they make it so darn perfect. The vegetarian soup is excellent! The shrimp tandoori is amazing and quite a presentation. So happy to have a place so close to home ♡ Lovely staff. I wish this place well for as long as I shall live ♡ My mouth and tummy are always satisfied. ♡< /review>

I ordered Salmon Teriyaki and I got mostly onions which leads me to believe the people who run this place aren’t Japanese. The rice was sticky not good either. I will never order from this place ever again. Poor quality ingredients and bad cooking.< /text>

<Review>I ordered online and went to pick up 5 minutes after the time they told me it will be ready but they were not ready to wait for 5 minutes.  6 orders got picked up while I was sitting and waiting for almost 45 minutes. I had to ask three times before I got it and they acted like what they did is right. Don’t over promise and under delivered just saying< /Review>< pictures>

Food is great!! Delivery is quick. It has never given me an upset stomach. Usually I have to order Mild at Indian restaurants but can handle Medium at this one. It's not as spicy as most Indian restaurants which is good for the American palet. If you prefer your food to be spicy spicy, just let them know.</Review>

<username>Beverly Lodge<//username><Review>Sad to say we haven't been impressed by many restaurants in this area, but this place has consistently VERY impressed! Third time in, we have take out from here and the lamb vindaloo is excellent, the naan is great, the sauces are fantastic, and the saffron rice is nutty and delicious! Very happy :)<//Review>< userid>

< review>
Ordered chicken tika and there was no curry, super thick mixture but when I asked they brought me a side of curry that I had to add myself... which I is why I’m giving 2 stars but they should have remade the dish. The greeter, waitress, and taking phone order was all 1 person that was also babysitting. Service was extremely slow and food was below average. They need to step up their game big time.</review>

This was our first time eating here but it seemed like theplace just opened up and the wait staff were greenhorns. There was no sense of organization the food needed more spices and food were being sent back because it didn't taste like what it should be and that was from a lady who i believe was also Asian. That was sad. The service was very slow although we got our food with in a few minutes. Other people who were already sitting when we walked in still did not receive their food even before we left out and have paid for our lunch. Will not be returning.</Text>

<review>Food was ok...

Service was UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!

I ordered food to drop off at my daughter's lunch as a treat.  I ask for not spicy or mild.   It was so hot my wife could not even eat it.

I like hot, but it was not for me.

I called and spoke to the manager and he argued that I said medium not mild.   I said "not spicy"???    And started arguing with me.   Even though he want there at the time.

So my daughter had rice and bread for lunch.

Thanks for nothing.< /review><response>None< /response><name>Hao Voqui</name><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

<review>Quick and good service. Good food! I had chicken korma and mango chutney with garlic naan. It all tasted very nice.
I also had mango lassi, I could taste that the mango's were canned, but it was still good. I saw there were a lot of bad reviews lately so I was skeptical, but I wanted Indian. It was well worth it!!< /review>< username>

<review>I get lunch buffet a couple of times a month. Everything is very good and there are always 2 or 3 vegan options, and they will even give you chapati instead of naan bc the chapatis are vegan. They are very kind and caring😊</review>< Response>

< review>
One horrible place . We first half hour for some one to take or order . Second , we waited for 40 mins for order to arrive but it failed finally . We never got our food .  We checked with the chef about the order , they had not even started making it .  We asked the should we wait and will the arrive ? They failed to give a promising answer . We finally walked out without food . Horrible management<//review>

A delightful respite from suburban tedium just seconds off the freeway, Deep Creek Park is a bit of paradise perfect for children of all ages. Consisting of playground equipment and basketball courts enclosed in lawns of verdant green, this place is a wonderful location to recreate and relax. Two thumbs up!<//Text>

Convenient park for the local community. Has a nice outdoor playground, large open field, and baseball diamond. Only negative is that Canada Geese like to hang out and take lots of dumps all over the field. Not too hard to clean off your shoe on the clean patches of grass though.< /text>

Like Whoa...

Yes, Genentech is on the hills of the Bay and it's fancy to boot.
I visited recently and I was definitely impressed.  It's amazing, the building architecture, the security (subtle, but functional), the views.  Why no one felt that this area was good to live at... I don't know.

It's hard to review more than the look and feel, because (1) I don't work there, and (b) it was my first time.  But I can say that it looks like a nice place to work</review>

<review>Worst place to work in biotech for millenials
Lots of old Gen X and Baby Boomers, go elsewhere, get paid, do better for yourself.

Also, the cafeterias are like college dorm food. These cafeterias do not have quality food at the level of other tech or biotechs. It's quite poorly done and the options are terrible. In a war for benefits and perks, Genentech has become Roche.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808f78439026935d:0x8749d7c258d58231</gmapID></record>

< Review>
I had Christine as my realtor and she was the most unprofessional, rude and condescending. She couldn't even get me what I was looking for. She was always late and never returned my phone calls. I even met up with her at a home and the door was locked. My range was anywhere between 6 million to 10 million and all she wanted to show me was places that was 12 million and up. She couldn't remember anything I was looking for...does she have dementia?? Really disappointed as I really wanted to buy a home in the LA area. So instead I fired her and went with Chrishell. Thank you Chrishell for helping me find a home. This is the only reason why I gave it a five-star.</Review>

< Review>
Rather than rate this firm based on realty tv, the review should be based on service levels to both buyers and sellers. I work in real estate in Scotland and looking at the Google reviews it’s totally misleading. Based on the average price of their listings then they must be doing business well. Good luck guys moving forward in Hollywood Real Estate. King-Residential, Scotland 🦁<//Review>

If you feel the appearance of these women is offensive then I would welcome you to take a good, long hard look at yourself (on the inside.) You can’t genuinely love yourself and criticize others’ looks. The Oppenheim brothers know that beautiful people sell real estate in their area and there is nothing wrong with capitalizing on WILLING and beautiful women.

I gave this business a five star review because of their reputation and success in this part of L.A.’s saturated market.

Lastly, the girls are hot, smart and successful, so either learn from them—or reevaluate your frustrations.</Review><Rating>5<//Rating><resp>None< /resp><user>115535609773806648218</user></record></dataset><record>

Kind of funny to me how people are rating and judging people based on a show 😂😂😂 Would it be entertainment if they only did their jobs and there was no drama. For one, I loved the show, 2nd of all it has nothing to do with the business itself! It is tv people!!! I understand if they were unprofessional when you were buying a house from them, but this was only tv. My Gosh!!!</review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>I enjoyed the show but quite a toxic environment.
Of all the ladies, Mary is the most professional. She acts her age. Is calm and very talented. Her heart and head are in the right place.

Chriselle should find her own niche. She is clearly not wanted. She should stop bringing up her background, it was a little too much. Some memories and experiences are to be shared in certain places, at certain times. She doesnt have a friend there, even Maya is not. She was the one who spilled the beans.
Chriselle also talks too much. Not a secret keeper.

Christine: really admired you in the beginning but you are very trashy. Dont respect anyone even your boss. You are trying to show you are tough. Tone in down

Heather: 2nd most professional person. Concentrate at the moment. Dont mingle business with pleasure.

Davina: cant really place you. Direct, matured but you started this. You should have called out Chriselle from the beginning, in private. But you gossiped to Maya, who then told others.

Overall, the office is crawling with estrogens, so expect DRAMA.

Jason and Brett should get males in.<//Text>< Name>

<text>Based on the TV show any place that allows bullying, harassment, and clear unprofessionalism is not somewhere I would spend my money. The Oppenheimer brothers should be ashamed to have a catty, distasteful work environment. The show is a true reflection of how this company would handle potential investments.  Horrible!</text>< Pics>

<Text>Great Hainan style chicken. Perfectly poached for both white and dark meat. Exceptional value as well. Lots of food, top quality, extremely reasonable price. If they were hipsters they could easily charge double for their dishes</Text>< pictures>

I admire this restaurant! They give great food, they have a rich menu, The chef in that restaurant is a real pro, I like a lot eating all their dishes. The dishes are always fresh and tasty, the attitude towards the guests  is friendly. I often eat in this restaurant and I not even once was disappointed. I recommend it with no hesitation.<//text>

<Text>Get the Hainan chicken! Please love yourself a little and order it. They speak English and Cantonese or just say the number. It’s order #2. So delicious and yummy. Chicken was warm and juicy and the rice so flavorful. Can’t recommend the chicken enough!< /Text><user_name>Henry Chang</user_name><userid>104829849670496199440< /userid><gmap_id>0x80c2d19e26aa90d7:0x45b7bd85a8c7c3af< /gmap_id>< time>

I call this marvelous  place every couple of days because I enjoy the  special atmosphere that is part of this restaurant. The staff is extremely welcoming and well trained. The service is extraordinarily quick. Needless to say, the food they prepare is good. I visited many times and I was always delighted. The price is honest. I highly suggest this restaurant to to everybody.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Attentive and quick service, food is serve very quick after you ordered. Great place for quick lunch. Parking on weekends can be a challenge. The restaurant is quite small situated in a predominantly hispanic strip mall, it is located very close to King Tacos. Why come here? If you want some cheap and tasty Hainan chicken rice with a refreshing $1.59 ice coffee/boba milk tea to wash it down with. Or want some tender beef tripe noodle soup with wontons? Cravings for rice noodles rolls with egg + (shrimp/beef/fish fillet). The waitresses here speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and English.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c2d19e26aa90d7:0x45b7bd85a8c7c3af</gmapID></record>

<Text>The Hainan chicken noodle soup broth has a subtle flavor that perfectly complements the juicy and tender slices of Hainan chicken. The noodles  balance the slightly savory and sweet flavors of the broth with it's even more delicate consistency.  Everytime I eat this dish it reminds me of how my grandmother used to cook for me when I was little. Its like eating a home cooked meal without actually being at home. 💗< /Text><gmap_id>0x80c2d19e26aa90d7:0x45b7bd85a8c7c3af<//gmap_id>< time>

<review>I was pleasantly surprised to find a restaurant that serves a decent Hainan Chicken. I'm a Savoy worshiper, and this place is not as good, but I've tried many places for HC and this place was the best trade off of being closer to me and not having to wait in line. The two ladies at work there we're both very kind and very humble. You can tell they're working hard and trying to do a good job. The ginger sauce wasn't as good as sabway also but the red sauce was a little bit better to me then sideways, but then again, I'm a ginger sauce kind of person.</review>< Pictures>

Great boba and always a spot I'll hit up when I'm in the area. Tried their food for the first time and the hot pot was good. The beef roll is not the best but the popcorn chicken is good and spicy.< /text>

If you consider yourself a foodie, make Ten Ren your first stop on any visit to the San Gabriel Valley.  With multiple locations and a huge menu, Ten Ren is so much more than a boba place!  They offer classic Chinese/Taiwanese snacks, tea-based drinks, alcohol, and even full meals like hot pots and various fried rice dishes. I live on the East Coast, but I hit up Ten Ren on every visit to So Cal.  In fact, I will be going there this evening for my usual fried tofu, tea marinated eggs, and a matcha milk tea.  It’s so nice, while traveling, to snack on something that hasn’t been purchased at a convenience store.  Service is always friendly and usually fast to boot.  Love me some Ten Ren!</Text>

<review>It's a great place to stop by for a quick bite. Service is always prompt and friendly. The food tastes fresh and well prepared. They have lots of different teas, as the name suggests, as well as a few beers on tap and Sterling Vintners Collection Meritage, which happens to be my favorite Sterling wine. Highly recommend!< /review><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

My favorite spot in town for a honey green milk tea with boba. They use actual tea here so the milk teas don’t taste artificial. Their boba is always perfectly cooked as well. The drinks are always consistently great, but the food and service is a hit or miss. My family comes quite often since they have such a wide variety of dishes, and our frequent orders are the sweet potato fries with plum powder, braised pork rice/noodles with egg, beef rolls, and chicken fillet.< /Text>

Definitely a place I come back to after a long trip to help me feel at home again. Love the Iced Green Tea Mojito and Satay Fried Rice. They're Three flavored chicken entree is awesome too. It comes with vegetables of the day, soup and a side of rice ... white or brown. Highly recommend this place for lunch but avoid the rush as they're quite busy at lunch. The kitchen also closes by 9:00 pm so get there before then.< /text>

Great choices of drink here, and they also serve beers on tap. Perfect place for gathering for hand shaked tea drink or just a quick bite. Its usually crowded during lunch hour, so if your planning a lunch meeting here, try to be there before 12 or after 1pm to avoid long wait.</Review>

Be sure you have plenty of time to eat here.  The place is not big enough and usually ends up with waiting time.  Other than the waits, the food and drinks are good for regular basis.  It is a good place to have some relaxed time with friends.< /text>

<user_id>111041826300691548984< /user_id><Review>I met up with college friend for lunch at Ten Ren’s Tea Time since it’s close to her work.
I’ve been here once before. I got stewed pork belly rice last time, and didn’t really like it.
This time I tried their pork chop rice, and it was great!
The pork chop was cut into smaller pieces. Very tender and flavorful.
The two side dishes, broccoli and curry potatoes were both tasty.

Friend ordered spicy marinated mix with noodle soup.
She said she always order this dish and likes it a lot.
The spicy marinated mix has tofu, seaweed and pig ears.

I also got the mango milk icee drink with boba and pudding.
It was super yummy.

Ten Ren’s Tea Time is a good place to have a quick lunch or dinner.
Or get a drink and catch up with friends.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rating>

If you are looking to save money this is not the place to go to. Otherwise, the food is good and the boba drinks are swell. But what worries me a bit is that for a long time they still haven't been able to raise their health grade above a "B".

Tip: If you need to charge your phone, sit at the booths on the east side of the restaurant. The power outlets are next to your legs where you sit down.<//Text>

Oh,  Do not order Sichuan style Chinese food.   It is popular in this area, however this restaurant has no clue how to cook it.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c32bbca175a525:0xd36d7eac369a5c0d</Gmap_id></record>

Our server, Jessica is amazing! High spirited, welcoming smile, and helped us decide what to order.  She was patient with our group of 6 and spent the time to answer all of our questions without rushing.  She also switched out the mix bowl for need stew because it was too spicy for us and it contained fish (not listed on the menu).

The food was better than expected. The Taiwanese Chowmain, and the popcorn chicken were both great. Their teas are consistently delicious, especially when they are discounted when you order an entree....$1.95 for a regular milk tea!

We always have a good time at Ten Ren.... The kids love their boba.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Excellent hour and a half out and back moderate hike. Excellent views and three benches to rest on the way up. Do the loop trail.</Text>

Such a great trail right at the edge of town.  It wanders to the top of Spring Hill. The long steady grade affords outstanding views of Mount Shasta and surrounding areas.< /Text>

Super great hiking trail. Perfect length to get your body warmed up. Stop at all the benches and do pushups and air squats to really get a full body feeling.  Great views as well all along the trail.<//review>

This is a well maintained trail with spectacular views. Take a close look at the pine needles piled at the base of a small tree on the right side as you ascend.< /text>

I can't put any stars up because just as I started up the hill, I saw a bear cub. It ran away from me, and I walked back to my car as fast as I could. So, I decided to go for a walk around Siskiyou lake.</Review>

This park cured my kids boredom from the smaller parks in our area. The playground is super big and has tons of things to climb on. They also had a dog park, a covered picnic area, and 4 locked door bathrooms. The kids had a blast splashing in the water after getting hot on the playground.<//review>

Springview park has everything. They have a dog park small and large, a state park, a bike park with dirt Mounds behind the skatepark, a water park for kids and a Frisbee golf park! Haunted Mansion they have the usual park benches and playground for kids. This park is huge and a lot of fun by the way they have bathrooms!< /review>

Probably one of the coolest places in this area. I love how many different attractions there are. The disc golf course is great, and I love seeing all the pups at the dog park. Very fun and beautiful place< /Review>

What a fun place to visit and shoot some cool pics. Dog park, basketball courts, tennis courts, pickleball courts, stream, frisbee golf and acres of open space. What a terrific open space to refresh and renew<//review>

Lots of space. Great for running and there is a separate park for dogs. Only downside imo is all the frisbee golfers who smoke and make the air all smelly<//review>

Beautiful park grounds to walk around, just watch out for the flying frisbees. This park features a very large frisbee golf course - I didn't even know that was a thing outside of Golf Story. The course is laid out amongst beautiful trees, along a creek, and setup around some fields. You are welcome to walk through the area, just be aware of very fast-moving frisbees flying around. There is also 2 playgrounds, including one for toddlers. But the star of this park is the frisbee course.< /Text>

I grew up coming here, and loved running around the playground, going to the Rocklin Jubilee, and going to the library. I took my kids here for the first time, and the first time I've been back in who knows how long. This place has changed so much, but in all positive ways. I think the playground has been redone, the splash pad is so fun, but it's still the same nostalgic park I remember. It makes me miss being home< /review>

This park is a good size with, multiple play areas for kids and a dog park. It also has a water park, that's just been added in that's a decent size. It has a large picnic area that is very well shaded too.

I just think like most parks it could use more teater totters, and merry go rounds.< /Review>

<text>So many things to do here! There's a huge dog park, hiking trails all through the trees, a playground, disk golf, skate park, basketball and (i think) tennis courts, splash pad right next to a huge picnic area with a lot of tables and built in barbecues. They have a lot of events at this park from movie nights to food truck mania to live music, there's always something for everyone here!< /text>< name>

<text>Great place to take the kids. Lots of area with tables under the shade. My daughter loves to play in the water on the splash pad then she is able to run to the park and play. Great dog park with a hose and a little pool so the dogs keep cool.</text></record>

The dog park turned out to be my favorite so far. Beautifully landscaped. Sprinklers, pools, and agility course all under the shade of oak trees.< /text>

< Review>
Great family fun park and covered gazebo areas for time out of the elements.  Plenty of parking except when events are held I would recommend to walk, bike, uber or get there early.  I love playing the 18 hole disc golf course.  Beware of hole #3's water hazard and bring plenty of fluids in hotter months because it will take time to get through the course (about 2 -2.5 hours).< /Review>

Nice park, something for everyone. However, major renovations occurring. Bathroom facilities are a mess. Portable toilets available, but be careful they may be a bit rough on nose. They are not clean and provide no water to wash hands. Basics.
It will get better.</review>

Nice disc golf course. One thing my friend who was with me today said is some of the basket place signs are missing there letter location for the hole.
Hole 17 the sign is completely missing.
Should be something checked on.<//Review>

Great dog park, only downside is it's bark instead of grass, so when they all get running it can get dusty. Disc golf course is super solid, though I'm baised as it's my home course. Overall pretty great park.< /Review>

Big open field for soccer, roller hockey rink, nice skate park, and my favorite is the frisbee golf course. Fairly well marked but needs maintenance.< /review>

<Review>This is an old but great park venue, today we were there for a reserved event in one of the covered picnic pavilions.  Thank goodness we had the cover to to May rain.  We used the grills for our bbq potluck for 50 or so people.  We had plenty of seating and taped down table cloths for a cleaner food area.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

A wonderful place to spend at least a couple hours every weekend. My nephew loves the spot and I enjoy the sheer size of the place. You can have a BBQ, play some field sports, take your children to playgrounds, basketball courts, tennis courts, a dry hockey rink, a skate park, the disc golf course, or on a walk about the place.

Just watch those discs!</text>

One of the best parks around this area. It has many different facilities here. Tennis courts, basketball courts, beach volleyball, running path, picnic area, covered pavilion, skate park, skate rink, large field, and even a Frisbee golf course.  Always seems pretty clean.  There's a lot to do here for the entire family.</Review>

The really nice thing about the park is that it has a bark base which is great when there has been recent wet weather. Most dog parks are muddy during this time. Also, the large oak trees keep the park shaded when the conditions are bright and and warm.</text>< pictures>

Good dog park.  Fair size.  Bark is unique ground cover, but VERY dusty.  Only one water station and only one water bowl and only one pool.  Water in bowl and pool is always dirty due to the very dusty bark.  Also, the pool and bowl at the water station are messy to empty because the small drain is often clogged with bark creating a dirty pool.  People are generally friendly.<//review>

Clean, well maintained city park with bathrooms and quite a few amenities. My two grandchildren love this place and it is a good place for them to blow off some steam. They like the slides and climbing areas as well as the sand pit and the toys in it. We spend at least two hours here when they visit. Highly recommend, great job City of Rocklin managing resources.</text>

<review>They have a pretty big dog park and a moderate sized playground. They also have a nice disc golf course that can get busy on the weekends. Careful if you are going to walk around the trails in the area as there are lots of frisbees flying everywhere! There is also an unused track and football field nearby as well.< /review></record>

All five star brah.
A community park where the city made an open space for real people. Besides all normal stuff like kid play ground, picnic benches, bathrooms, tennis courts, street hockey, dog park and the best of all a real fun disc golf course. The City of Rocklin did it right.< /text>

<Review>My buddy and I come here a couple times a month for a round of disc golf. Park is usually quite clean, though some trash often accumulates in/around the creeks/moats passing through the course. Overall a nice, relatively flat place to play at. Be careful in the reeds around the water as you might end up wearing a Golden Orbweaver. They're relatively harmless, but if you don't like spiders, they'll definitely give you a start!<//Review><user_name>Ken</user_name>< Date>

Great family friendly park, however seems that they coty of Rocklin needs money and so they ticket people walking their dog off leash on back trails. Never been an issue until now, and my dog stays by my side per his protocol training to be a working dog.</review>

Rocklin is a unique place. Small town feel, but it's really not small. This park is absolutely beautiful. The kids love to play, and there's plenty of room for a bbq. The creek that runs on the back side is loaded with fish. Something to do for everyone young and old.<//text>

<Review>This is a great place for picnics, ballgames, walking and a dog park which is always open, rain or shine.  My main complaint, though, is that the disc golfers have taken over almost the entire park so people who want to walk are at their mercy. Many of these guys also smoke, which makes it doubly bothersome. Otherwise, a pretty nice park.</Review><Date>1491073957092<//Date><GmapID>0x809b1f69f0a71c93:0xed30079bf344deb8<//GmapID><Resp>None< /Resp>< rating>

I grew up skating here. It's not the best skatepark in the world but it's fun to roll around for a few hours from time to time. The rest of the park is awesome, they do food trucks and other festivities here during the summer.</review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>Really enjoy this park when the weather is below 80 degrees. But when the weather is hot so is this non shaded park. Also there are no water fountains or garbage cans near the parking lot next to the buildings. There are garbage cans about 50 ft away at the park. And there is a water fountain next to the dog park. Really need to update this park with a water fountain near the parking lot and buildings, garbage cans near the parking lot, & sails for the play structure.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I grew up skating here. It's not the best skatepark in the world but it's fun to roll around for a few hours from time to time. The rest of the park is awesome, they do food trucks and other festivities here during the summer.</Text>< pictures>

I didn't realize how large this park was until I finally went there and checked it out. Could be timing because I usually go there on my lunch breaks but it has never been crowded when I've been there.<//Text>

< Review>
I love this park for the dog park, kids playground, but most of all for the DISC GOLF COURSE! There is a Final 9 located by the front lot. Skate park looks cool. There is also a basketball court and vending machines nearby. There are bathrooms by the dog park and hole 1 of the DGC, but there is no soap or seat covers. BYO sanitizer.< /Review>

This park has just about everything.  Anytime there's an event in Rocklin it happens here because the venue is so diverse.  All they need is some water features but Rocklin is very water conservative so I doubt that will happen.<//Text>
