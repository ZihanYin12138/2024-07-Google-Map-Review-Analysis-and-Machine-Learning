There is a reason why they are "SMOG KING" they really can get things done. TLDR My RV failed to have smog check at 2 stations, one said it's too big for them and 2nd failed to perform the smog test due to "not able to find in Vehicle Lookup Table" which waste my whole day with DMV.  This guy knows how to get it done correctly,  he also tried different ways to collect RPM ( somehow OBDII did not connect). He focused on my smog test for about 40 mins.  Price listed on the wall,  very clear, mostly importantly get things done! 5 out of 5  👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻, I'd recommend it to anyone need smog check</Text>

Fast service and very nice people. Got there and vehicle was ready to be inspected in 5 minutes after entering all my information. Also visit their website to get a coupon for your discount. Magazines, water and coffee inside plus a restroom. Chairs and table to relax while your car is getting completed. Was a good experience, bring your insurance card and identification.< /review>

Very fast service.  Especially if you have a OBDII car that does not need the tire rollers and exhaust pipe sniffer.  They have portable readers so they can do your car outside the drive-in bay while another car is in the bay.

Very  helpful and nice.<//Text>

Now they moved to an easier location to find them 32 California Ave. I had not asked for an appointment but took the opportunity that I was passing through and had the papers for the DMV inspection. They took me and 15 minutes later I walked out with the inspection done. Thanks Smog King</review>

< review>
$98 just for smog check of a small car. The price is really super. There is a sign at the entrance of the road and another sign at the door. Near it there is Rynck tire. I did not see another smog checking shop nearby within 100 meters. Forgot to mention, that $98 does not include the register fee which is over $8. The guy in the shop told me there a coupon of $30 on the website but I could only find a $20 one. So even with the coupon, the price will be over $86 and Smog King think that is less than others in the area.  Please be honest.</review>

Quick service. A little on the pricier side, but these guys know what they are doing and can fix anything. If you have an easy, no chance of failing smog, maybe go somewhere  else and pay less. However, if you have anything less straightforward, this is a great place to go. I walked in with no appointment and they took me right away. They we're friendly and quick.</Review>

<Text>I went to smog king after class last night and they really delivered. I never expected service like I had from a mechanic shop. Scott was amazing and very caring. I made an appointment the day before and I was in and out in 15 minutes. I am well trained in customer care and it felt good to be on the other side of good customer service. Thank you Scott for making my experience a good one. I highly recommend Smog King in Pleasanton.</Text>< Pics>

One of the best boba places in town. Boba is warm, fresh, and full of flavor. So many drinks to choose from and although they do run out of a lot of stuff they're still very helpful. I recommend the Cocoa Wow milk cap with boba!<//review>

Have been very obsessed with this place💗 Another great boba place to try out! They have more flavors you can mix up. I've been adding the Milk Cap's to my drinks and it's a game changer. You guy's should try them out 🙌< /text>

The drinks are so delicious! Staff are friendly and store looks clean. This was my first time trying this location during my visit in California  and I’ve had a great customer experience.< /Review>

Honestly they have good customer service but I think the milk that they used today was spoiled. I have an upset stomach and nauseous. My husband smelled it and didn’t even want to try it. Something was definitely spoiled. I would still come back though and give them another chance.<//Text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Text>The shop doesn't feel very inviting. It could be because of how everything is now due to Covid but I didn't have the best vibe. The staff was ok. I've came across better. The bubble shops I usually go to all seem like great buddies and you can feel that vibe when you walk in, but this place doesn't give that feeling.

The drinks...I've definitely had better. I'm not sure how I feel about powdered milks being used. It doesn't taste that great and I have to shake it pretty much every time I take a sip because the powder sits on top. I also wished they had more pictures of the mixtures of drinks too.

I don't think I will come back mainly because of the powdered milk thing. The shop was nice and clean though and there was no wait. They were quick with the drinks. They do have Door Dash, so that may be the only way I will order again because they're aren't many boba shops for delivery. Other than that, I will stick to my usual boba shops in the area.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

I've tried several things on the menu. Everything is delicious.<//review>

<date>1592180074589</date><Review>This is my very first time going to this boba tea house. I ordered 4 drinks. For my drink, I wanted 70% sweetness, but what I got was 100%. I know it is 100% because I go to a lot of boba places and I always get 70%. I also tried the other drinks we got to make sure that this place's drinks really are not just this sweet, they aren't. Another problem.. 1 drink came with no sweetness. Imagine a thai milk tea with no sweetness whatsoever. Bitter, nasty, not drinkable. This was my girlfriend's drink. Yes, I did go back and they made me another drink (no charge), but just the fact that having to go outside more often than needed, at this time (covid-19), just increases the chances of catching it. Every time I go out, I wear a sweater, long pants, a mask, and gloves just to make sure I do not get it. This does not mean that it will completely prevent it, it is still possible to catch it. Another thing is that there were only 4 parties in the boba house (all less than 3 people each). Not that many people, but they still somehow end up messing up a very simple thai milk tea with boba (100% sweetness).< /Review><user_id>102467746569390920972< /user_id>< Pics>

<text>BEST DONUTS IN SCV.  BUT BE AWARE, AS THE WORD GETS OUT ABOUT HOW AWESOME THEY ARE, THEY DO SELL OUT.  AS WITH ANY DONUT STORE, WHEN THEY SELL OUT, THEY WILL CLOSE.  SO BE A EARLY BIRD, GET SOME OF THE (CRAZY FRESH LIGHT FLUFFY) DONUTS FOR YOURSELF.  TOM AND HIS WIFE RUN THIS FAMILY BUSINESS AND TREAT IT WITH LOVE AND CARE.  YOU WILL SEE THE DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR FIRST BITE.  DON'T FORGET THEY HAVE MUFFINS AS WELL FOR A ALTERNATIVE AND WOW ARE THEY AMAZING.  TRY THEM AND YOU WILL SEE WHY WE ALL LOVE THEM SO MUCH.....<//text></record>
</dataset><record>
<Text>2021 Update:  so excited... they are back in full swing after the start of the pandemic.  Now open everyday to serve us donut lovers!!!!

The best and freshest donuts in town.  The freshly brewed coffee is also perfect.  Strong enough to wake and energize me in the morning and you can’t beat the price.  I think the coffee tastes so much better than the Starbucks down the street. My favorite donuts:
Chocolate Twist, cream cheese muffin, donut crumbs

Although, this is more of a morning joint, I am sad that the hours have been changed due to the pandemic!  We need to support of local businesses❤️</Text>< userid>

My babies and I went here for the first time today and what a nice experience we had! The gentleman behind the counter was so kind and patient with us. They had a really good selection of donuts to choose from and we arrived around 10am. The donuts we're absolutely delicious.
I definitely recommend going to this cute donut shop if you are looking for excellent quality donuts with great service 👌<//review>

On the other hand, watch how much you pay for your items. The guy that seems to be the owner overcharged me. Bought a medium coffee and two sugar doughnuts.  1.75+2.20= 3.95, he charged my card 4.30. Not much but it counts at the end of the day. If there is a fee for using a debit card, it is not posted in the store.< /Text>< Date>

This has been a family stop for us for years.  The owner is always friendly and welcoming,  the selection of doughnuts in the morning is good.  I love the glazed doughnut holes and the chocolate chip log.  Best doughnut shop around!< /Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Best donuts in the Ranch! Quality and great service! I usually go for a vanilla iced coffee and either a breakfast sandwich or donut. They are  so good. The donuts and breakfast sandwiches are so fresh and soft. Softest dough. However they do sell out pretty quick... like by 10 am. So you need to be an early bird for this place. They will still have treats by 10 am, but not everyone’s favorites.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

This place is super convenient.  They are fast and helpful and the donuts are fresh and delicious.  It's easy to make friends at the office, just bring donuts!  I stop in for a dozen when I'm having an especially good day and share them at work.<//text>

<text>They had literally 3 donuts left before  10am and they looked at least a day old. They didn't have half of the things on the menu. Ordered bagel with cream cheese and they gave me the cream cheese on the side. Worst donut store I've been too!!!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Nobody wants to help you the guy with the machine that recycles phones wants you to find a service manager Walmart informed you that they no longer have service managers because it was too expensive so I ended up donating my dad's AT&t phone with charger and battery to their cause and even though they had all my contact info they never even attempted to follow up with me I won't try this again and I warned other people to stay far away from it by the time you understand what's going on you've already missed deposited what you took to recycle</review>< pictures>

<Review>Would be a good keymaker but you have to wait 3 to 5 days for them to mail you the key plus they charge you $10 to make keys with NFL and sports logos so they can truly make money off you if you dont mind waiting for your mail to come 3 to 5 days then its ok i guess<//Review>< Response>

<text>I have been going to Primary Eyecare Optometric for several years now and I have found it to be an exceptional office. From the friendly receptionists, who great you on the way in, to the technicians, who perform all sorts of eye tests quickly and thoroughly, to Dr. Dea, who expertly evaluates my eyesight and prescribes the perfect prescription for my needs, they all do so while also answering all my questions and even carrying on meaningful conversations! I'm especially grateful to Dr. Dea, who explains my scans in layman's terms each year; and in so doing, he also teaches me about my own eyesight and its progression. This time there were also additional sterile cleanings on each piece of equipment. It's always been spotless there, but now they have instituted even more systems to ensure there was a virus-free environment. I'm so impressed that I've recommended them to 3 friends and they are all going there, too. As you can tell, I'm a very satisfied patient.<//text></record>

< review>
I would not recommend this place. I had made an appointment and had waited several weeks only to have my appointment canceled just hours before I was scheduled to arrive. No explanation was given and I was only told someone would call to reschedule the appointment on the following Monday.
Monday came and went and there was no followup. I called and was greeted with an automated message that the office had been exposed to COVID-19 (Corona Virus.) This was never explained when my appointment was canceled nor was it communicated to me at a later point. DID PRIMARY EYECARE EVEN WARN THE CLIENTS THAT WERE EXPOSED? I can't be sure but their unprofessionalism would cause me concern.
Several days later and I still haven't been contacted about rescheduling.  Once again It was up to me to call the office and get a status update. The receptionist lied and said they were open Monday (even though they were letting an automated message do their dirt work that same Monday) And I had to pry what happened out of her. She said she would set up a new appointment for me... IN THREE WEEKS.
I understand there is a global pandemic and everyone is running a little short staffed or under duress. But it doesn't make sense that I should have to go nearly a month and a half without an appointment because of their mismanagement. Unless that particular optometrist is on available for two week because they have COVID (but I stress they didn't communicate this as an excuse) leaving me to only assume they just don't have the ability to accommodate me in a timely manner.<//review>

The eye doctor has always cause me a lot of anxiety, but I feel totally comfortable here.  However,  the front office staff needs some help.  I've never had a positive interaction with them.  I've been waiting for a month for my contacts, but apparently my mailbox was full.  So, they knew that I didn't get the message and never bothered to call back.  When they called to confirm my last appointment, my son was in the middle of a tantrum, so I asked them to call back.  Instead, they automatically cancelled my appointment, but didn't tell me.  So I showed up and was told I couldn't be seen that day.  Thankfully I pressed and they fit me in.  The only reason I stay here is because this is the first eye doctor where I haven't had extreme anxiety in the appointment.  Just wish the front office staff wasn't so rude and unhelpful.</text>< Resp>

I really appreciate how professional, clean and welcoming this office is. I have been going here for a couple of years, and the front desk is always very helpful when they check me in. I see Dr. Osias and he is really good about explaining every detail of what he is doing and whats going on with my eye. Overall good experience and got my contacts and glasses no problem.
Bonus: The fish tank in the waiting room is pretty cool :D<//Review>

Dr. Dea is very friendly and yet very professional. Making your visit to the office appointment seems like visiting an old friend. I would highly recommend him to anyone.<//Review>

I have been with Dr. Osias at Primary Eyecare for many years.  I've depended on his careful attention and diagnosis to keep me seeing, even though I have optometric services through my HMO.  I was particularly impressed my last visit with the helpfulness and knowledge of the support staff this time.  I was in and out in an hour including a complete exam and glasses repair.< /Review>

<Text>I have been fortunate enough to have Dr. Osias as my Optometrist for a number of years.  Dr. Osias is like an old friend, and he treats me as such, he knows about my preexisting conditions and always keeps a watchful eye on my eye's and eye wear.
Normally, I see Dr. Osias for my annual eye exam, however this year I ran into a bit of trouble with my Primary Physicians request that I get an eye screening at Kaiser.  Kaiser "found" a problem with my eyes with the pictures they took. Not only did this put a good scare into me it also added a lot of stress to my world.
Dr. Osias was happy to recheck my eyes, and run a new Optomap series of images on my eyes even though I had a series of pics done in February at my annual check up.  Dr. Osias worked with me to figure out what Kaiser had likely seen. It turned out Dr. Osias had already seen the issue and was watching it. He collected data and drafted a note for the people at Kaiser, explaining his findings and the promise that IF my eye's developed a problem he would without hesitation direct me to the right people to get any corrective action taken.
I have loyalty to Dr. Osias, that only comes with years of working together, trust and mutual respect.
Primary Eyecare has been there for me when i was a cash paying customer as well as when I had insurance.  They have always tried to work with me to save money, and they are flexible in working around my schedule.
I would and will recommend Dr. Osias without any hesitation.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

I saw a doctor in this office. Following the exam, I went to order the glasses I had already chosen while waiting for the exam, and was told that I needed a separate appointment to buy glasses. I drove down the road to Visual Insight, ordered glasses, and they have been my family's eye care provider since then.

It's now been a year. This office has apparently taken it upon themselves to schedule another appointment. I first received a phone call asking to change this appointment, which I never made, and I told them to cancel it. I then received a text confirming this appointment, which I never made, and I called and told them to cancel it. I have now received an email reminding me about the appointment, which I never made, with the warning, "Please note that we do not accept changes or cancellations via email." I regret having given them my contact information.</review>

Dr. Dea is wonderful! I've been a patient in his practice for almost 20 years. Dr. Dea is knowledgeable & always friendly and explains every process of the eye exam. I just love him! I do have to say some of his office staff is rude,  the front desk staff is good but the assistants really need to improve on their customer service. The last couple of years they tell you to come at a certain time to pick up glasses and then always cancel last minute saying they're not ready...kind of frustrating. Otherwise I am very pleased with Primary Optometrics. I also love the new location in Castro Valley. Kudos to Dr. Dea.< /review>

I've been going there for over 25 years when they had the old office in San Lorenzo. They had excellent customer service and great staff. My father is the one who introduced me to Primary Eyecare. Since then I have referred family members, friends, and co-workers due to great customer service and there professionalism. However, for the past 3-5 years it has gone downhill. All of the friendly and courteous staff is gone. I walk in for an adjustment and they say everything has to be done my appointment. I can understand if they are busy, but sometimes it'll be only myself sitting in the loby. I always paid cash and did not use my insurance because when you pay with cash they give you a two year warranty on your lenses and frames. I have used their services more then once in two years. All of a sudden, if you pay cash you only get one time exchange. Also, if you pay cash you only one exchange in two years. I asked to speak to the supervisor and she tells me this has always been their policy. I told that you have did this before where you exchange it for me past practice, and she said no. I told her to look at my file so she could see it. I asked to speak to the owner.  I was told she would replay the message and get back to me in a week, which he never did. I usually spend between $500-800 on a single pair of glasses every year at their office for my 3 kids and I, so I expect when there is a deep scratch or a problem with the frame they'll honor their product and their warrant. Unfortunately, this has changed. My dollar is good anywhere. Thereofore, I will not be purachsing glasses here for neither myself or family and will be informing my friends and coworkers about this policy change.</Review>

Brought my El Camino in and had them convert my Drums to Discs and Mike was extremely helpful and communicative with me and made me feel comfortable with the whole process. While working on the Drum to Disc Conversion they noticed my axel bearings were not functioning correctly thus they swapped them out for me. The car stops a helluva lot better now and taking my car back for some work in the gauges! Definitely recommend you take your whip here for any service you need! Tell em Jesse sent you!</Text>

<time>1607149552466< /time><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>MISDIAGNOSING ISSUES, ERRORS IN REPAIR JOBS I HAVE TO FIX MYSELF, LAZY WORKMANSHIP,  UNNECESSARY UPSELL, ADD-ONS TO PARTS AND LABOR I NEVER APPROVED HAVING DONE, YET STILL GET CHARGED FOR.

almost $8,000.000 later, after literally paying to have EVERYTHING replaced in the suspension, exhaust, and drivetrain on a chevy van project, I am still having issues. especially in my rear end....

Very poor workmanship...

I had brought in a van project to be restored  about a year ago now.
At first I had my front shocks and control arms done, along with my brakes, Which the seemed to do a great job with.

Since then, it seemed like EVERY TIME I had more work done, more and more extra parts and labor charges kept accumulating IN THE MIDDLE OF THE JOB.

I had brought in my own parts, but it seems like every time, other things needed ordered or replaced.

I am a rather proficient mechanic myself, but have no lift or garage, nor the time to work on such a large project.  When i first received my vehicle back after a motor swap, the vehicle knock sensor was installed on the top of the block, instead of by the starter on the bottom, and the timing was done completely backwards, and my vacuum lines where hooked up backwards as well. (MY MOTOR WAS ACTUALLY SUCKING CHARCOAL FROM THE CANISTER INSTEAD OF BEING LET OUT FROM THE THROTTLE BODY) it had kept tripping codes, NAMELY the kncok sensor, and speed sensor (which was do to rough idle from non existent vacuum in the system) and instead of checking over the motor to make sure it was hooked up[ right, they decided to change my speed sensor (i had already had a new transmission installed at this point, so 600.00 labor and parts for a brand new sensor being replaced again....

I was the one who figured out the problem.

My rear end started out fine, and after I had ordered the wrong ring and pinion (my fault)  everything was replaced, for them to tell me AFTER that the whole axle housing needed replaced, another 400 bucks for that, plus a used ring and pinion from them that cost more than the new one i had to send back,  but yet, after ALL THIS,

THEY STILL DECIDE TO USE THE YOKE OFF THE BAD HOUSING, WITH ALL MY NEW PARTS, MY REAR END STILL CLUNKS AND HOWLS, AND IS GETTING WORSE BY THE DAY. so thanks for all the good parts you charged me for, just to have them in danger of becomin garbage again...

i had conveyed this to mike, the owner, and stated my issue, and wanted this axle issue and the labor compensated for the speed sensor, and vacuum/timing mishap, he agreed to take care of me, so cool, at least I thought...

So then, as compensation I had him do some work on my wifes car, (trans flush, battery and alternator swap, along with new terminal connectors... well 150.00 to swap out a battery i bought and brought, NOT REPLACING THE TERMINALS, AND A 700 BILL LATER WE HAD AGREED ON 350, WHICH WAS ME JUST BEING DONE WITH THESE GUYS AT THAT POINT...

SO I SENT MY WIFE DOWN TO RETRIEVE HER CAR, THEY CHARGE HER THE FULL 780.00, AND THEN AFTER I AM LOOKIN AT THE RECIEPT THERE IS A CHARGE TO HAVE AN EXHAUST TIP WELDED, (WHICH I DID NOT ASK TO HAVE DONE, NOR WAS I CONTACTED ABOUT HAVING IT DONE EITHER) and low and behold, there definately WAS an exhaust tip installed!  I didnt even notice this until recently, after looking trhrough my invoices,

I DONT KNOW WHO IS IN CHARGE OF CHECKING THE LABOR COMIN OUTTA THERE, OR WHO IS IN CHARGE OF WRITING UP THE INVOICES, BUT BEWARE!!!

WHAT STARTED AS FEELING LIKE I FINALLY FOUND A SHOP IN SAN DIEGO THAT IS TRUSTWORTHY, I END UP FEELING LIKE I GOT BENT OVER A BARREL.

FIRST TIME THEY WILL TAKE CARE OF YA,

BUT ONCE THEY REALIZE THEY GOT YOU FOR A BIG JOB, BE PREPARED TO GET GOUGED HARD.

I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS SHOP TO ANYONE SERIOUS ABOUT THEIR CAR PROJECTS.

I HAVE ALMOST 8K IN LABOR THAT I HAVE GIVEN TO THIS SHOP, all in a span of a few mos...

I AM EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED WITH THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE.

ITS A SHAME CAUSE THE OWNER SEEMS LIKE A NICE ENOUGH GUY, BUT OBVIOUSLY HES NOT THERE ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE HIS PEOPLE ARE DOING GOOD WORK.

<review>My friend had purchased a magniflo from them and had them install it. He paid 1400 for this in December 2018. Invoice states it and was happy. Then came on 2020 a transmission problem. It was then discovered budget muffler, this business did not install magniflo direct fit. It was a after market part .my friend confronted both owner's and has been given reasons, stories after stories that doesn't prove they installed the right kind that was purchased. Even acknowledged with pictures they continue to lie and refused to accept they we're caught cheating a consumer and charging higher. He got no results from both brother's that run this business. I feel this company has been doing this for a long time. This has to be reported to district attorney. A case to investigate all repairs done and check on how many customers has been taken advantage off. Possible class action suit if founded there's more out there. License should be suspended and charge them a huge fine.</review>< user>

<Text>They did a great job!  The customer service from Abraham (and also the owner of the shop, sorry, I don't remember his name) was on point which I appreciate.  I needed a front catalytic converter replacement.  The price was unbelievably reasonable considering that I am a woman and mechanics usually jack up the price when they see a female (without a man on her arm) coming through the door.  So, I said "WTH", I even threw in an oil change.  They even put a couple of missing skid plate bolts on for no extra charge! When getting my car repaired, I usually feel some sort of tension (mainly my blood pressure going up because I know the bill is coming) but I felt no tension. Thanks guys!!  I appreciated your help with my vehicle today ;-)< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

This is pretty much just a muffler shop and just that. I had my brakes done here and was never satisfied with them. The brakes never stopped sqeaking even though they were new. I assume they used cheap parts on my vehicle. They try hard to up sell by offering to change your air cabin filter and overcharge for doing it. I declined. After everything was done and paid for. A few days go by I begin to install a new cabin filter on my car and come to find out the muffler shop never put my old back in there. I was very disappointed at this point. I would definitely be careful and watch what you choose to have done to your vehicle here. I won't be returning.< /text>

Mike was amazing. I called with an issue and told him what I thought it was. He listened to me and told me to bring it in when I could. I dropped my vehicle off am hour easier than I said I would and it was no issue. Mike and his crew found the issue with in minutes and called me to tell me what it was. This place has amazing pricing and speedy service. They changed my exhaust manifold, gasket, and O2 sensor. All of this and the labor cost me $500.00. Every where else minimum price was $800.00 and they couldn't promise me I would get it back the same day. Mike got my car back to me within 5 hours. Love this place and will only be going here for all of my car needs.<//Review>

Mike and his crew were very professional, helpful, and informative throughout the process of fixing my car.

I have owned my 2010 Camaro for almost five years now and just recently noticed that my brakes were showing signs of wear so I decided to take it in for some new brake pads. Upon further inspection, Mike noticed that the front rotors were burnt and gave me the option to file the rotors or replace them, giving me price estimates for both.

After getting the necessary brake pad and rotor work taken care of, I thought that I would throw in some new struts as well, seeing as my car hasn’t had any new ones in quite a long time. Mike let me know after inspecting the struts, that I only needed the front ones replaced, also giving me a price estimate for the front (and rear) as well as a time frame when to replace the rear ones.

All in all, very respectable and transparent working culture. I appreciate the honest work and the level of care Mike and his crew put in the work. Another benefit was that due to the nature of the work, it took longer than they had in the day to finish, requiring them to keep my car overnight (I brought it in at 3:30pm, they close at 5), so Mike let me borrow his Jeep free of charge.

I will be coming back here for sure!< /text>

I had no anxiety going in, the workers were all nice and friendly, they told me everything they were going to do and how much it would cost before doing it instead of after. would definitely be going back< /review>

* SOMEBODY AT THIS SHOP IS A THIEF *

I took my car to this shop for the first time just to get a piece of my exhaust exchanged. Not thinking, somebody would steal anything out of my car. Well boy was I wrong! I drove to this location wearing my sunglasses, I placed them in the door pocket of my car. When I get in my car the first thing I reach for are my shades, I notice they are gone! I get out, I to ask if anyone had maybe dropped them or maybe moved them. Nobody can get me a solid answer. “I didn’t see anything” “where were they” “how much are they” are the things I hear.  The thing is one guy drove my car to the back. Another guy worked on it, another guy drove it back around to the front. So it’s no telling who took it. I just know somebody at that shop took my glasses. I even gave them a chance to just say they fell out of the door, & give them back to me. Nobody wanted to own up to stealing my shades. Valued at $300’s (a gift from my wife) + the $150 they charged me I would say it’s not worth taking your vehicle to this place if you can’t trust them to NOT STEAL FROM YOU.
Other than that, car sounds fine...
I actually had more work for them I wanted done on my other car. But, I would NEVER go back.
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!
& IF YOU TAKE YOUR CAR HERE!
DONT LEAVE ANYTHING INSIDE THEY CAN TAKE.<//Text>

I own a 2014 Porsche Panamera and needed to quiet down my exhaust. I got in contact with Budget Muffler via e-mailed and was contacted by Mike (who was extremely professional and knowledgeable) who set me up with an appointment.
When I arrived to the location the gentleman at reception desk was very helpful and immediately, with assistance of one of the mechanics figured out a way to resolve my issue. They were extremely professional, knowledgeable and completed the work within an hour.< /review>

I saw reviews and came by to put on a new muffler. They were cool that I already had a muffler. Very friendly...wasn't pushed to get more than what I wanted. Reasonable price. I came in first thing in the morning and they took care of me right away. That's big plus there.</Text>

They looked at our car, found the parts , provided a very reasonable quote and promised our car back by the the same afternoon.  Not only did they deliver on their commitment but they did all this with the highest level of customer service and professionalism.  If I lived in the area I would definitely come back.

Needed 2 catalytic converters. Meineke and Budget still haven't called their quotes. Abraham got me a quick and good quote and the reviews looked good. They got me in the next morning. He was friendly and showed me what was wrong with my old ones. Told me things to watch for in the future, not that I needed now! 1st time; recommend to all. 6/15< /Review>

I bought a lowering kit for my 2000 dodge dakota  truck online ,for weeks i have been trying to get someone to install it. i went to budget auto and they got right on it for a very reasonable price. They were very professional and honest. they even loaned me a car overnight. I have been back there for more work on my truck and the same great service and price. They also carry great aftermarket products.</review>

Budget muffler was great. They got me in as early as possible. Even tho I knew I had vehicles ahead of me my wait was less than an hour. It was a simple brake bleed and mike was attentive enough to show me a few problems he thought I should know before going ahead as planned. 👍 thumbs up guys.< /Text>

<review>I took my car here about a week ago. The front desk was very friendly and easy to talk to. I thought my muffler was bad, but it turned out that my muffler was fine and the pipes leading to it were the problem. Rather than try and talk me into doing a bunch of extra and unnecessary work, they were completely upfront and honest with me about what needed to be done, and even gave me two reasonable options to choose from based on what they thought should be fixed.

In my experience it has been very hard to find honest mechanics and these guys were terrific. I was very pleased with the pricing and they did all of the work in about an hour while I waited even though I had not made an appointment. The car has been driving great again and I am extremely pleased with the service they provided at a very fair cost. I would highly recommend them based on my personal experience.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80d9543c8e7d988f:0x3d09efe86692708<//gmapID></record>

They can do an array of assignments that will be substantially lesser than the dealerships. I mean they have made catalytic converter for me and also installed it for all for 1000. I can actually stand by thier work more then the any dealership i have been to in San Diego. The fixes they have made to my vehicles have stood the test of time and have never been back twice for the same thing.<//Text>

I've known Mike for many years and he has worked on all my cars with expertise. Since moving to Oregon, I could not find a mechanic that could match Mike's experience and moral compass. I came here to have Mike diagnose my check engine light and resolve the problem. He discovered that an o2 sensor was the culprit. He ordered the part and had it replaced in a short time. Additionally,  I had the oil changed for the trip back to Oregon. I am completely satisfied with Mike and his staff. Job well done!<//Review>

Knew they needed replacing and welded my muffler back together saying that it just needed a kit. Ok. Go ahead and fix it. 1100 hundred dollars because of the labor? Asked if I could pick it up the next day no problem. Something in the demeanor made me change my mind.  I get in my car and noticed that SOMEONE went all through my car looking for whatever the could find. Forgot to take pictures before I put my xXxX back. Complained to the guy Fred ,John or whoever.

I took my car to Budget for a new muffler. They were efficient and professional. I will be having other work done at this location. I would recommend this shop to everyone.<//Review>

Name bad given.
They can't give you a price for brakes, 40 dlls for check if you don't want to fix it there and depending what needs you pay the difference .

This 5 star rating is at the moment for communication. I've been inquiring about a flowmaster vs magnaflow and IV been a nightmare with emails to Mike.. Lol. He's been consistently replying in a timely manner with great feedback. I will be getting the work done soon and rerating.<//text>

These guys are good with break and muffler service, however anything beyond that is questionable. After being a long time customer Mike offered and said his staff was capable of also doing repairs on a problem I mentioned with my vehicle. After agreeing and spending over a thousand dollars to fix the problem, the problem still persists. I dont like mechanics that just replace parts because they THINK they know whats wrong and just start replacing things at my expense. If you dont know 100% whats wrong dont offer the service.
Again, from now on i only stick to what they specialize in... Break and muffler...</review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>This place is perfect for your dogs, they provide grooming and the services are pretty nice! You also get first time discounts on the site. Other than that they have everything for cats and dogs with somewhat medium to high prices. The staff members are helpful and they know their stuff, I would recommend this place for your furry friend. I had to take an appointment from the app and they are busy so plan ahead, you have to enter every details of your pet from vaccinations to allergies.< /Text>< Pics>

Love these tags! This is the 2nd one we have bought for our dog. We only had to buy a new one due to having to buy a larger collar. Excellent quality!< /text>
<resp>{'time': 1603148392925, 'text': "Hello Kelley,\nThank you for your rating. Which tag did you purchase? We've been receiving reviews for a tag that we do not carry so I just wanted to be sure that it's the correct one. If it's for the Boomerang tag, we do not carry that brand and do not have any plans to add it to our product list any time in the near future. if it is that tag, you may want to consider removing this review and reposting it for the appropriate business as I'm sure they would appreciate your positive feedback.  If it was the Red Dingo tag, we do carry that brand and they are absolutely terrific."}</resp></record></dataset><record>

Love love love healthy spot! They treat my dog amazingly and I never have a problem with him grooming. My dog is a rescue and can have issues being put in a crate... when I mentioned that to the groomer, she said no problem and kept him up front with her. They’re amazing and I will keep coming back!< /Text>

<Text>Felt like I was eating food from my mom and late grandmother. I was staying near the area and wanted an early breakfast. This place was open at 7am and I'm glad Google lead me to it. Tosilog and Embotido hit the spot and kept me full for majority of the day! Come here. The prices are diff good (esp for being in the city). Filipino Comfort Food at its finest.<//Text>< pics>

Last week was our first time we came to that place. But It is absolutely not the last time. We had great time with the efficient service, with the excellent  cuisine and fine drinks and with the modest price. We will no doubt visit there soon.<//Review>

<text>Only three blocks from the JW Marriott but only open during the day.  Grabbed some lunch for the wife: BBQ Stick, Palabok and Lumpia.  BBQ Stick tasty and meat was moist, Palabok nice and garlicky, Lumpia on the large side and probably best only when hot, not as much meat as I would prefer, more cabbage but nice people and very popular spot.< /text><Response>None<//Response><time>1612485859399< /time></record>

Lovely filipino cuisine food.
Benignit..dinaguan..sisig..pancit..halo halo.
Smells wonderful inside.
The workers were nice. Our family dined in, but everytime that front door swung open... A brief rush of piss odor hit us while eating..<//review>

<review>This is one of my (if not my absolute) favourite filipino restaurants in SF. I came across it pretty much by accident when I was looking for filipino food, not having heard of it beforel It's located in TL which isn't the greatest, but it's not a deal breaker (plus, if the location was really an issue for you, they're available on some food delivery platforms). Upon entering, it already felt "familiar" in a way that other filipino restaurants in SF didn't. It felt homey and the staff were friendly and kinda reminded me of my aunties; they were helpful too, especially when they (probably) saw the overwhelmed look on my and my bf's faces when seeing the lengthy menu. Eventually (and multiple times since that first visit) I settled on the tapsilog and it has become one of my favourite things to get here... that, and the lumpia. Can't argue with the classics ;) The last time I was here, I brought some of my filipina friends with me and they liked the food too, especially the lechon.

Food is ok but the people who own it are not friendly and the outside smells like urine and human waste right outside the door and they don't even power wash the outside in front of their restaurant and they have the nerves to act as if you are the one who did it. My recommendation to them is learn customer skills before you open a place of business.</Review>

Excellent Pinoy food. Tocino, Filipino menudo (NOT to be confused with the Mexican version). A word of caution: if you want tapa, what they make here is actually bistek at other places. They adjust some of their items to "American" tastes. They have good silogs ( choice of various meats with rice and fried egg).<//Review>

The staff is friendly. They have a variety of dishes on rotation, and I've never tried one that I didn't like. The prices are reasonable as well. I'm not quite sure why Filipino food never took off like Thai, or even Burmese, food has. But if you haven't had much Filipino food this is a great place to try. They serve accessible dishes like adobo and bisteak.  They also offer dishes for those who want to try food that sharply departs from standard American fare, such as dinuguan and pig ear sisig. Finally, don't be put off by the location. It's worth it.</text>

<Time>1392935278731<//Time><rate>4<//rate><Review>There aren't a lot of Filipino restaurants in the city that I like. With a decent population of Filipinos, you would think there would be more options, but there isn't. I often have to venture out. But Kusina Ni Tess is one of my downtown spots when I need my fix. It's a cheap turo-turo place. Turo-turo literally means "point-point". Obviously, you point at the food you want. But I mean you can still talk and ask questions, as most people there speak English.

They have a good deal for about $7-8 bucks for a two item meal with rice. You can also ask for a free side of sabow (soup broth, usually nilaga or sinigang broth). I like the adobos and the paksiws. I usually come here with my boyfriend, and that two item meal ends up being enough for the both of us. $7-8  for two people? Sheeet. What a steal!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I have been going to
Other Firestone locations
Around town for over 20
Some years...

Only place.  I have found
That u can trust them to
Do only what needs to be
Done to ur car.

Friendly.  Fast.  And good
For ur car...</Text>

<Review>I never have an issue when I go to Fireatone on Plaza Blvd. Staff is friendly and courteous. Always give good and realistic expectation times. One thing I did not get though is $30 to patch my tire?? $0 @ Discount Tire...and you didnt even have to buy the tire there.< /Review>< Pics>

BEWARE: This shop is dishonest. I brought my tire to get replaced, no problem. A guy named Alan comes back to tell me its gonna be 300$ ( just labor and took an hour and some change just to tell me that) just to take out one stud that is stripped.I had my car serviced there and in Bakersfield, there were no problems with the studs and i had them rotated prior.I said no, he didnt even offer an alternative or other services he had like: a tire repair plug or anything. After coming home, i noticed my stud is sticking out more than my other studs. They got away with malpractice, and tried to price gauge me. And theY keep trying to make you buy into thier credit card scheme, dont do it!

< Review>
They are the one who scheduled for my appointment. I came on time. It took them 3 hrs for oil change and tire rotation. They could've canceled that appointment if they are really swamped and I could've went somewhere else. Never again! 1 star is waaay too generous for this review.<//Review>

<review>They lied about pricing and wouldn't give back the keys unless we signed electronically saying we'd pay more than orally agreed upon. Not ,"the experience you want," would never recommend. Lying and cheating people out of extra money than agreed upon, "is what they do best."   Never go to this Firestone.<//review>< Rating>

I come to Firestone with all three of the family vehicles. A couple of weeks ago and they noticed that one of my wheel studs was stripped from being tightened to much. Since my tires were purchased and serviced at their station, they immediately took responsibility for the $ 300.00 repair without any question. It is refreshing to find an automotive repair facility that is honest and holds the highest level of integrity and professionalism. I am here again to get an oil change on Sunday morning and they took me right in. They are also open on weekends which is so nice for those of us that work Monday through Friday.Thanks to the crew at national City Firestone. They have a satisfied customer for life.</text>

<Text>I've given this ship 2 chances to get their service right in the past. Now I always go to the one by highland. All they care about is revenue here. Forget customer service. Go to highland ppl. The guys there have been there for years and customer service comes first without pressure. I trust them and will avoid this location from now on.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>Wow!  Everything was great!  From the ease at getting an appointment, to the fast fast fast service.  I was in for a brake repair job (that another place failed to fix after 3 visits), and it only took 3 hours from me walking in to me driving happily out.  Sales Rep explained clearly what was going on and showed me the part that was supposed to be put in (and showed the product description that clearly stated it was the correct part for my car).  I really like being assured that the problem was going to be fixed and that everything was explained clearly.  I was kept informed on what was being done, Happily, the work was done sooner than originally stated.  The place was clean.  The other patrons inside had said they had come to this Firestone before and were very pleased.  So, first hand experience and hearing others praise this place made me feel GREAT that I picked this Firestone.  THANK YOU!!</text><gmapID>0x80d952278acfee4b:0x4ab2f4d68729da06< /gmapID><date>1537331126575< /date><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Rating>5< /Rating><userid>110359258297576619337<//userid>< name>

Don't take your vehicle here unless you want to get scammed out of money. I bought my car in because the brakes were making noise & they told me that I needed new pads, rotors, and calipers which was going to cost me $900. Thankfully I decided to get a second opinion before agreeing because it turns out my car didn't need ANY OF THOSE REPAIRS. My rotors and calipers were fine and the break pads still have half of their life left. Save your money & go somewhere else.< /review>

They are always busy so make sure you get in before you need to! Other than that they are very kind and can usually fix whatever problem your car is having at reasonable prices.  I have compared them to local competition and I end up choosing them each time!</review>

This place has always taken care of me when it came to repairing or getting new tires. Haven't used their other services they offer. They are quick on repairs where I'm not there any longer than an hour. I prefer coming here over some other tire services.</review>

This place is terrible, I only went because I thought it was still a Goodyear and my car needed to have the tire changed ASAP. They didn’t even give me options on what would be cheaper. They just told me your tire will be $200...FOR ONE TIRE ON A FORD RANGER!! This place is terrible and they are worse to women. They will just tell you to replace, Firestone apparently can’t fix anything, they only have you buy a replacement.<//text>

Price quoted was different than charged. The owner's son gave lower price for Samosas Couple of weeks ago but when I went in to buy the product, they charged higher price and flatly denied that they quoted lower price earlier.</review>

I have given this restaurant a few tries hoping that the quality would one day get better but to my disappointment the lack of flavor remained consistent after every take out order. My last order consisted of lamb biriyani and beef kebob. The biriyani was obviously defrosted in a microwave and as a result, tasted watered down, ithe dish has no lamb meat only bones and fat. The beef kebob had a pasty texture and was undercooked.<//Review>

This is the Spot where I grab a case of Pakistani Pakola and a chicken kebab roll. The best kebab roll in LA with a sauce/chutni that adds so much flavor I don't mind driving 25 miles every other week to pick up these two favorites.

They do carry majority of indo pak grocery stuff and a good fresh halal meat department. The young man working the counter is extremely polite and helpful.< /review>

Good service. I have been going there to buy our groceries it seems like forever. I place the order in advance for my meats to cut in a certain way and the quantity and how I want it bagged. Family run business a d they also have a restaurant next door for Pakistani and Indian food. Would definitely recommend it.< /review>

If I could give this place a negative star I would. I couldn’t even describe how terrible the food tasted. Not even that, I waited for so long just for the lady to get what I wanted. ( she was extremely rude!!) I know it takes time to order but there was literally no one there. The bathroom is also not so great. I wouldn’t want to go here again.</review>

This place is not clean at all. Tables, counters, shelves, all look so dirty and unorganized. The water they gave us had dirt particles in it. I have tried their food twice and it feels unhygienic to me. I am sure I won't come here again.< /Text>

I shop here often at Grocery Outlet they actually have a parking space reserved for Veterans only.  How cool is that!  I find good deals on great wines and bargains on food items.  Very convenient shopping all in one location.<//review>

Very nice place to go get the things that you need in a jiffy. Not only is Trader Joe's in this Shopping Center but Smart & Final as well as Grocery Outlet are all conveniently located in the same vicinity. Did I mention Dimple Records is also in this Roseville Square. The staff there was very friendly and very knowledgeable. I took in some CDs that I will no longer be listening to thanks to Apple music and I got paid cash for them the very same day. They also buy vinyl records, cassette tapes, and DVD's. They buy video games and consoles and also sell them at reasonable prices. I would highly recommend taking any of your unwanted media to Dimple Records... Trader Joes also has a decent size selection of of flowers that are in bloom!<//Text>

This is not a comfort western and workwear.... it's  Trader Joe's..a store for people to shop at so they can feel like they are part of the popular kids. Most of the women who shop here have "speak to the manager" haircuts  and yoga pants and probably do cocaine to cope with their busy schedules of kids going to soccer practice and lacrosse, and trying to keep a skin and bones figure to get their husband's back from his mistress. Wich, or course, will never happen because his mistress would never wear yoga pants and stupid haircuts.
The food is silly and the bell ringing and fake camaraderie gives me a migrane. But, it's a toss up. Do I want to catch an infection by going to Walmart, or do I want a migraine and cocaine? Tough choice.idk.<//text>

Nice to get in and out without a hassle. Grocery outlet has extremely likeable, helpful and friendly employees. Stores ALWAYS clean and they ALWAYS open a register rather than have lines. ♥️
My favorite grocery outlet location. Thank you keep up the great work!<//Text>

Love this store. A little smaller than most. But absolutely wonderful prices. Well-organized and definitely a place to shop when you're looking for a wonderful deal in wines and food. Have fun and enjoy. PS take a look at their cosmetic I'll you can get some really good deals.<//Text>

The thrift store lady's had me thrown out . I was with a guy with tattoos.  She was staring at him the whole time. We own a co. We work for a living and was there to buy each other a pair of true religion matching. She made comments about him probably not going to pay for what we had in our hands and I said something. They called the cops.
If u blasted with tats like us. Do not go into freestyle exchange. I do not write bad reviews. This place is bad. Not one person. 3 people.</Review>

<text>I have shopped at the Square my entire life. The facades and businesses have changed over the years, but it is still as busy as ever. The parking lot leaves something to be desired (space) but the selection of shops is good. The addition of Dimple means that I could easily spend hours shopping.</text><rating>5</rating>< time>

Best grocery outlet around. Great prices, great location. And u can write your name on your receipt and enter it in a drawing if u get chosen u are given the amount of money u saved on your receipt. I saved 264.00 on my purchases of 40.00. Entered to win but was unlucky. Lol. Still a fav store of mine n my husband< /Text>

I have shopped at the Square my entire life. The facades and businesses have changed over the years, but it is still as busy as ever. The parking lot leaves something to be desired (space) but the selection of shops is good. The addition of Dimple means that I could easily spend hours shopping.<//Review>

<text>Sometimes there are groups of homeless at Rite aid and the bus stop but, all the other businesses keep things safe and tidy for their customers. Love the children's clothing store, Trader Joe's, Big n Tall, Grocery Outlet, Sally's, Subway, the book/music store and Smart and final. Roseville Square is a great place to wander around if you are looking for a unique gift or fun find!< /text><user_id>114284104793541198624<//user_id>< GmapID>

There are a lot of decent stores here, including my favorites: The Grocery Outlet, Dimple Records, and Trader Joe's. There is also a Starbucks, pet store, vet clinic, nail salon, rite aid... But there aren't any bike racks, and the parking lot is miserable to navigate and dangerous.

There are benches throughout, but no tables. No public restrooms as far as I can tell. Good for quick trips, bad if you ride a bike or are worried about your car being dinged up.</text>

<Text>It's a pleasure to be able to go into Roseville and find the shopping center that's pretty clean. Trader Joe's is a little expensive The Bargain Market is starting to get there as well considering there a Bargain Market.

Hit and miss overstock. Sometimes an amazing bargain other times not so much. And Staples tend to be overpriced if you're running there for milk or butter or whatever can be pricey. And then also sometimes they don't have stuff that you know you need or want for recipe. I miss sunflower market that was there and I am so sad that they are closed and sprouts doesn't even hold a candle to them. Not a huge fan of grocery outlet but I will go there occasionally< /Text>

<review>I pretty much can find what I need in this shopping center. It's pretty straightforward and simple and you can get beauty products, sandwiches, diner food, music, outdoor gear, organic food, and great shopping deals at Grocery Outlet. There's also a Rite-Aid which is helpful. The only thing that is sort of annoying is the parking is really cramped.</review><rating>4< /rating><Date>1509636214213< /Date></record>

< Review>
Roseville square has lots of shopping and a Trader Joe's which we all love. The Chase Bank is conveniently located. Parking is easy and it's right off Hwy 80. There is also a Bank of America as well. I like the Sally's Beauty Supply. I can get all my little beauty supplies there. Rite Aide has the yummy Thrifty Ice Cream. Good easy shopping!</Review>

Traders, grocery outlet, incredible pets, and CVS make this a super convenient stop.  Added bonus of Starbucks, any mountain, sally's, and spin (great gift shop) are great too.  Haven't been but there is even a new record store, and the used/new clothing store next to traders has great deals...as does once upon a child a few doors down.  Only gets four starts instead of five because the parking spots are pretty shallow, and people in our town are parking-challenged.<//text>

Any Mountain is a great store for any of your hiking, biking, or skiing needs. They have good variety and products. Staff are really friendly and will ask you multiple times if you need help. Trader Joes is a super popular health food store and Starbucks is good too. Don't much care for the rest of the places on the lot</Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>It's a nice little shopping center but parking spaces are very tight. If you enjoy classic diners, definitely go eat at Chubby's because their service is great and very reasonable prices. They just moved Dimple records there which I love because it's so much bigger. And grocery outlet is always worth a look.< /review>< Rating>

<review>As great as it was in the 70's and 80's as I remember it from frequent visits after a mean car crash. I was 19. Its still the same great service as then. Pharmacy and medicines have changed much, and I am confident that my pharmacist is as well—informed then as now, for frequent visits. Yes, another car crash. They kept me in good hands all the years.  I would recommend this store over any other in the area.</review><rate>5< /rate>< UserId.>

The shopping center has a wide variety stores so you can really maximize your time in a short distance. This Shopping Center in particular has several of my favorite stores in there, from grocery to retail. Trader Joe's is my favorite all-time place to shop for groceries because they have such clean tasty food, and also located inside of the summer is freestyle clothing which is my all-time number one go to retail dealer and they are Consignment so you just get the best of both worlds! I come in from out of town regularly and really leave without having made at least one trip to the center of all amazingness! LOL! Definitely worth going out of your way if you have to, if not get there! You won't regret it!</review>

Hard to imagine back in the day this used to be Rosevilles mall. Times have changed and so has the kinds of stores offered here. Check out the discount grocery deals at Groccery Outlet, get a yummy treat at Starbucks, a Cool 50s /60s dinner is a local favorite, other stores include Rite Aid, Trader Joe's, 2 banks, Subway, and the new home of Dimples Music. Something for everyone. Just 2 bad things. (1) The parking is crazy here and can be a Mad House on the weekends. TIP: park in the back by the Senior Housing. (2) There is a, high at times homeless/ pan handler/  druggie element here.</review>

Great shopping center with Trader Joe's and Grocery Outlet. Parking can be tight, but if you're willing to walk a little you'll find a spot.</text>

I went to the AutoZone and they were really great but what I like a lot about this square is there could never be a shortage of parking spaces. It's a huge lot and stores are close by. Plus the lighting is great at night.</Review>

Love me some Trader Joe's! There's also good banking, a coffee shop (I wish was Pete's) a market for inexpensive items that Joe's doesn't carry. Good place, lots of parking and conveniently located by I-80 and the center of town. West Roseville after Denios Auction does not exist for those of us that are true Rosevilleites. 20 , 30 , 40 years doesn't count. If you weren't here in the seventies than you're a interloper. Thank you.<//text>

<Text>I only go there because Trader Joe's is there. The parking lot is large but the parking spots are too close together.  The lanes don't give you a lot of room to back into and the parking spot are narrow as well.<//Text>< Pics>

Could use more parking for Trader Joe’s, parking slots are a little narrow too making it harder to get in and out of cars.< /Review>

Easy access to a variety of shops right off 80 but parking is tight so don't drive the pickup/suv and if you do get a spot on the sides for more room.< /Review>

Roseville Square has a lot to offer, the 76 on the corner has a great car wash, the people who work there are awesome!

Besides the car wash there's my favorite place to grocery shop; Trader Joe's!

But that's not all!  There's a BofA, Grocery Outlet, Catherine's (women's plus size), Sally's, two used clothes stores (1 children's and 1 adult trendy clothes), Men's big & Tall, a couple restraunts, Rite Aide,  a pet supply store, sporting supply store and more!< /Text>

This place has gone downhill over the years but still nice enough.
The parking lot is a nightmare though, wouldn't recommend going at peak times.
It's usually clean, but nothing over and above a regular shopping center.</review>

This is a great place to get breakfast (at chubby's) and have fun time at dimples just browsing. They have a Trader Joes right there so that works out nicely.</review>

<Review>I absolutely LOVE the shopping variety! Downfall is it's literally ALWAYS SOOO crowded. I mean that's ultimately a good sign. Other patrons obviously value the variety as well. Purely selfish shopping wish lol. I am a Trader Joe's fanatic and have been to almost every store from the Bay area, to Elk Grove, Sac and now Roseville and can comfortably say the Roseville store is up there with the best. Come to the Roseville Square for tons of options!</Review>< rate>

They have been trying for years to bring this shopping center back from the dead. They've remodeled most of the buildings now and there are several good businesses in the center, but still a lot of little vacancies and low traffic on the Southern end of the center. I would love to see this place back 100%. The parking here is awkward, cramped and very poorly laid out. Notable businesses are Trader Joes, Smart and Final, Bank of America, Grocery Outlet, Rite Aid, Banfield Veterinary, Any Mountain Sporting Goods and Chase Bank.</text>

Parking is ridiculous. I was almost t-boned due to cramped parking. Trader Joe's is a store I love. But I hate crowds. This place is always crowded, so much so that it could (and has) caused a panic attack for me. They are the only place I can find ginger chews. Sally's beauty disappointed me, I was told if something didn't work out for me, as long as I had the empty product and receipt I could get a refund. That was not true. Chubby's is always delicious and easier area to park.</text>

Lots of places to shop here, but the traffic and parking is challenging. Small parking spaces and a Trader Joe’s to boot, so it’s usually busy here.</Review>
