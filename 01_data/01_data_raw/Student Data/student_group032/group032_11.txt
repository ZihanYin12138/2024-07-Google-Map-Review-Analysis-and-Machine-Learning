<Time>1595363005888<//Time><Review>I purchased a phone which I added to my plan I was told that the package came with a phone case so we picked one out. I paid by doing a split payment half now and the other half on my bill. We walked out forgetting the case and then I was told that since I did a split payment it was no longer a deal. I was not told this, Lizty the staff told me that if I was paying attention and smart enough to understand I would have known. I was completely offended. Lizty walked away with her hands up with peace signs. I would recommend that she needs training in customer service and professionalism. I called corporate office and also spoke with the manger Marisela the next day and she stated that she would talk to her. I felt as she didn't really care. The problem was not taken care of I wasn't offered the case at the end. I would never recommend going to this store. I usually go to another one, but they didn't have it in stock.< /Review><rate>1<//rate><response>None< /response><user_name>Kimberly Taylor</user_name><pictures>None</pictures></record>

Great customer service. I was very impressed with the way the young lady Crystal attended me. She was very kind and helpful with everything from helping me choose a phone for my needs, to getting my phone all set up with my information, contacts, pictures, and even all my apps. I recently went back to add my two boys into my account and I was very happy she helped me out with that as well with no hesitation .  I will definitely be back to this place</text>

Ive been coming to this location for about 2 years now and  I used to love coming to this store because Edward was extremely helpful. After he left, these two ladies which I believe were Karla and Crystal, were just as much help as Edward and gave me really good deals. I recently went and realized there were many new faces. I was hoping they would give me the same treatment as Edward and the ladies but I was wrong. They didnt know what they were doing. Very rude and not helpful at all. I wont be coming here again!!!</Text>

<review>I have been here once, last year, to purchase a phone charger. The place is located near Tilted Kilt and Vallarta Supermarket. It looked clean. There are phones and other items to choose from. However, at that time, I only needed a phone charger, which I have purchased there.</review><Response>None</Response><username>Paulius Liutkus</username>< rate>

<Review>Nothing! Worst customer service. The guy Edward has no manners looks like and  behaves like a gangster. Bought a brand new phone took home only to find it was getting hot . took it back the next day but they refused to do any thing rather than wait 30 days for them to send a replacement phone. So no phone until the replacement in sent. That sucks. The guu Edward completly unprofessional. Refused to give owners contact number. Dont go there t</Review><Response>None<//Response><Rate>1<//Rate><date>1439327136750< /date>< pics>

Went a little something like this:
Me:"Hi, can I buy a Galaxy Mega?"
Sales Rep:"Ok, there is a $15 fee to buy a phone"
Me:"I have to pay $15 to buy a $500 phone?, Why?"
Sales Rep:"It costs $15 to keep your own number, it's an upgrade fee"
Me:"Do they charge $15 if I buy it online? I'm not really upgrading anything, I'm getting the same phone I have?"
Sales Rep:"No, they don't charge it online"
Me:"Soooo, it's actually disadvantageous for me to even come here?"
Sales Rep: Shoulders shrug, looking around the store for an answer that seems to be hidden somewhere.
Me:"Ok, well nevermind I guess, I'll go home and order it."

In a world that is gearing more and more towards online shopping, it blows my mind to see things like this.  Good luck, you serve no purpose what so ever.</text>

<Text>Went there to get information on the pool. The Rep was not available. One of the residents said that the lady is named Lutisha. She's Black. Never is at the clubhouse. You have keep calling her more than 1000 times. Until she answers. She doesn't return phone calls or emails. She's VERY LAZY.< /Text>< Pictures>

Had a very clean facility, hospital staff was very friendly and helpful and informative. One Nurse particularly stood out Frank was on his game didn't let me suffer. Thank you so much for taking such great care of me in my time of need.< /text>

We waited in a room forever. While the nurse staff laughed and watched stuff on their cell phones. Noone checked on me for 2 hours when I was in the ER room. Just ask ambulance to take you to another hospital. So disappointed.<//Review>

The people are nice, but there is a lack of full responsibility taken by staff. For example, at the main entrance there has been 20 feet of sticky spilled soda across the path for a month, with no cleaning. This is the path that every doctor, nurse, and janitor takes to enter the building.

I hope the cleaning in non-public areas is better than this, but I can’t tell.< /Text>

This is the worst hospital I’ve ever been
every time I go I  have to wait for hours before being helped, even if there isn’t anyone in the waiting room. Some staff are inefficient and I’ve even had an incident where one of the staff was on their phone instead of helping us.< /Text>

< Review>
I want to thank the nursing staff and care managers  for all their hard work during these trying times. My dad was admitted due to Covid, it was really hard for him to be alone in the hospital but the nurses and managers kept him in good spirits. Being as busy as they were they always had time to make sure we were able to speak to him on FaceTime. They cared for him very well.< /Review>

I had my 2nd baby there back in Sept and the labor and delivery nurses were absolutely wonderful. So kind and caring. Had a very quick labor and not time for any pain meds. The nurses worked quickly along with my doctor to get me ready and took really good care of me before, during, and after the delivery. Such a wonderful group of nurses that deserve some recognition. They so treated my husband with kindness as well.<//Text>

<text>By far the most disgusting and rude staff. My cousin had her baby here, the nurses made fun of us for waiting outside the window. We can’t be inside because of COVID and we are the only family they have! Then they called my cousin Exorcist for screaming while delivering. She was told to stop being dramatic and to push WITHOUT making noise. Her epidural didn’t work. Avoid this place like the plague.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

UNACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!  Avoid Dr. SINGH like the PLAGUE.  This hospital's staff are very unprofessional no bedside manner, and down right rude. During the pandemic I have had to visit the hospital for a severe medical condition and I was treated poorly everytime. The doctors are rude and dismissive and do not address your concerns. Hence you leave the hospital feeling worse than you did when you came (wait was 5 hours minimum). Plus 5 hours of them getting their heads out... while treating you.  Horrible experiences time and time again with the doctors specifically, and the nurses are just following orders so they will ignore you even if your crying, or dying and continue with their own personal stories, jokes, and drama amongst eachother.  The medical staff only care about COVID patients right now and are keeping only THEMSELVES safe, so avoid all hospitals because they behave the same in my whole community.  The rest of us are still dealing with health issues and should not be treated like second class citizens because our issues are valid and possibly just as life threatening.</text>

The doctor did not listen to any symptoms. I get it COVID-19 is common and everything may seem like "early COVID-19" when that is all you see. However, that is not every patients diagnosis. The nurses conversations could be heard complaining and making fun of patients. Not acceptable!!
Left this Emergency and went to St. Joseph's Hospital in Orange County. Great staff and proper treatment for the diagnosis, not "early COVID-19."< /review>

DO NOT COME HERE! Your emergency definitely isn’t their problem. They treat you as if you came in for nothing & you’re certainly on their time. They don’t care about your condition & they aren’t friendly at the receptionist desk. I am in serious pain with the flu & been here for hours... meanwhile everyone that looks like them gets seen before anyone else! I’m not from California & I’m not coming back to this hospital.

I’ve also NEVER seen so many EMTs sitting around doing nothing in an ER. No one is moving with haste, multiple rooms open, & a nurse just casually sweeping with a room full of people waiting!!! Unacceptable!</review>

This hospital has gone down hill. I understand that due to the pandemic it busy, however if we even go its because we are sick. I left after 5 hours waiting exposing myself to get more sick. They didnt give any updates or concern themselves with at least giving a solution. I understand that some people are worse than other, but it seems that i have to call 911 and have an ambulance pick me up in order to be seen. After 5 hours they didnt have a room not to mention no updates.  They have a sign in the waiting area that if your situation worsen to informed the recepti.onist, I told her 5 times and no concern was so ever. I went for symptoms of covid-19,  had only body ache and heache, while waiting there, I got a fever and could not stop coughing,  if it wasn't for my kid getting me water, they would not care at all.  To be in this field people have to be caring any considerate,  but this people in the reception were cruel. I kept on asking for 5 hours and nothing, I ask if i was next  and nothing. So pls plan it out, apparently people ambulances get first, even if your dying and with fever r, they wont help you. They will let you die, not to mention coughing while other are waiting. Horrible hospital,  never again. I will file a formal complaint for neglect.</Review>

Went in hurting to the ER. Super unprofessional staff. Nurse was just mean. They had me in for hours and gave me a huge bill and couldnt find anything. Went to a general doctor. He actually didnt believe I had been to a ER because my problem was so simple a med student should have been able to see/find it.< /text>

<text>I see the doctors and nurses here intercept all kinds of emergencies, and they do such a good job. It's really humbling. They go right from that situation into a new one all day. Sometimes some people complain on the wait here, but they don't know how busy it gets and how much the staff have on their plates. Overall im really impressed!</text>< Pics>

<review>First google maps has this listed on the wrong side of the street but review is for Alliance Healthcare: So far I’ve been waiting for an hour and a half for a scheduled appointment, the front desk staff let radiology know I’m waiting but no one has come to greet me or let me know how long it will be. I’m thinking about going home. There’s literally no one in this waiting room but me. They need to get it together. I do not recommend.< /review><rate>1< /rate></record>

<review>I with a passion hate ER's. I needed to go, so I asked a friend who has lived in the area for many decades.
Upon discharge from the ERp and can honestly say it was not as bad experience, overall positive.

The ER doctor could use some lessons on communicating with patients. He was a detached from me the patient being human but not rude. I was in a room and overheard him calling someone about me, talking about my situation and asking this person to come take a look. I couldn't hear it all but since my labs Xray and Ct scan  results had yet to be shared with me it was unnerving as a patient. I was given IV fluids and antibiotics but never told why. The surgeon who reviewed my test results and came to speak with me was awesome. The nurses and staff were all great just slow to provide info.</review><Name>Cyndee Maudlin<//Name><rate>4<//rate><Pics>None<//Pics>< time>

Very compassionate doctors and nurses. They work quickly and are knowledgeable. My veins are small so starting an IV is always difficult. Nurse Roger got me hooked up to an IV with only two tries.  Found a good vein on my inner left wrist, and the IV lasted through my hospital stay (3 days). This will be the only ER for me.<//Text>

<text>Attention: DO NOT GO TO THIS HOSPITAL. I went here because I had fainted and struggled to get up so I was pretty nervous. They hooked me up to an IV and then told me nothing was wrong. I come home to find two separate bills. I called the number on one of them and the lady told me she'd figure it out. Because I believed her, I paid it no mind until later I get a letter from a debt collector. I called the hospital back and NOW they tell me that because they are a PRIVATE hospital, the HOSPITAL can charge me AND so can the DOCTOR. So overall I have to pay almost $1,000 for a bag of salt water to be injected into me and a "I didn't find anything wrong" from the doctor!!!

And by the way the first lady who tried injecting the IV couldn't seem to find my vein on either arm so she kept digging it in there. The heart monitor that I was hooked up to kept beeping because she was basically inducing palpitations into me and the inner areas of my elbows each had about an inch and a half diameter sized bruise for over a week.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I wouldn't take my dog there.  My elderly mother was brought there and and she said the doctor couldn't see here because the doctor wasn't there at the hospital yet. This is like the middle of the day. What I do know is, when I finally got a call for where she was at. I went to pick her up, she was in puddle of her own excrement. I had to get a diaper and clean her up myself to get her home.<//review>

<review>Worse hospital. I got to the ER by ambulance. The staff and doctors here are unfriendly. They take their time m. I got an IV and the RN didn’t know what he was doing and I end up having a hand full of blood. He probably took 30 mins to finally get the bag and IV and medication to me. I don’t get explained what is going on or what is giving to me. Just a horrible experience. I’m surprised this hospital has not been sued yet. If I had a choice I wouldn’t choose to go this hospital! Only because the ambulance took me here.</review>< pictures>

This is the worst hospital I've ever dealt with. I had to schedule a surgery, admissions was a very aggressive girl who wore makeup to cover the tats around her neck (classy). Mind you, I'm scheduling a surgery and need to know things like... what time, etc.  Well, the staff was gone for the day... at 2pm. So she barked that they would call me the next day, no call. I can't change my surgery but now have to chase them down to get a time. I can't change venue as ENT works through here. ENT is great, but stay away from San Dimas Community Hospital!!!!</review>

<pics>None< /pics><review>I've never felt so disgusted in my life by an ER. All nurses/ "doctors" were Inappropriate, unethical and malpracticed. I've called the house supervisor three times since my last visit.

I have never in my life left negative feedback or review in my life... but my ER visit was so horrible, that I have to speak up and say something.

Does anyone know who I can contact outside this hospital besides a lawyer? The house supervisors aren't helpful whatsoever.

This hospital is obviously looking out for its own.  I refuse to stay quiet about my visit.

This is not okay...<//review>< user_id>

<Text>ER Staff are quick and knowledgeable, will get you stabilized and then it all goes down hill.

Leave this hospital after stabilized in the ER...!!!

I was in the hospital for 3 days that should have been one day.  Doctors assigned to your care have local practices in the area, see their day patients and then come by around 7-8 pm for a 5 minute consult and check the box for their hospial visit pay.

Nurses are under trained, under staffed, language barrier, incompetent people that I wouldn’t let treat my dog.

Avoid being admitted here, you’ve BEEN WARNED!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Took my daughter in to have her Gtube changed the doctor didn't have much of a bedside manner.  He placed the gtube and said ok you can go home.
I asked aren't you going to take a xray to confirm it's in the right place.  He you don't need one but I will order one. Mind this not the first time we have had replace the gtube and a cray has always been ordered. The xray dept staff and nursing  staff were fighting about whose responsibility it was to administer contrast injecting to take the Xray.  Finally after about 20min the doctor came not very happy to give administer the contrast.  Very disappointed about our service at this facility.<//Review>

This was a very good Hospital,I would recommend not going in on a weekend.The nurses that worked on Sat,sun were horrible,but the ones during the week were awesome! I got Admited to the Er in 15 minutes and the hospital with in 4 hours absolutely awesome and they made sure I was better.I went to Montclair hospital first and it took 3 hours to get in and they kicked me to the curb and I couldn't barley move! Horrible don't go there.</text>

There reputation compares to Montclair Doctor Offices which is very scary for a place like a hospital. Anyways my good friend told me that the nurses wasn’t giving the proper dosage  and or not giving at all my friends medication after days when they requested all of his regularity meds. My friend was supposed to be staying over night, in reality it turns outs out be a three night stay due to I’m compaction to his high blood pressure. It was just a horrible experience for my friend to go through and praise God he is still alive</text>< Pictures>

The hospital admin here must be sheer inhumane monsters, they terminated an employee named J. Stranzel because he dozed off at work while on night shift. He also lost his mother and her house, the guy is going thru cancer and chemotherapy and having to stay in hotels or shelters. All because 2 heartless co-workers took a pic of him dozing off a little on night shift, why couldn't they mind their own business? As if working nights while ill isn't hard enough. They didn't know what this man is going thru? I somehow doubt that. I thought hospitals should be places of understanding and refuge at the very least, not just healing. So disgraceful. Search him on change dot org and sign the petition to help him get his job back please!!! This is so wrong and he's been a loyal employee for countless years</Text>

Juan one of the nurses said give me a good reason why u don't want to be admitted. He kept pushing the issue after the fact I told him several times why. The Dr. Tried to bribe me like a child saying I'll only give u pain medicine if u get admitted otherwise no pain meds. The second nurse Carla kept telling me they need all the leads on me and I told her they were irritating my skin. She kept hounding me to put them on she also said it's policy to have the bed rails up. False no it's not I needed to use the restroom so I asked to leave them down she refused then the last nurse said I had to go out in a wheelchair I said I didn't need a wheelchair I was perfectly fine to walk on my own to feet and they all were amused that they were harassing me. Then they tried to tell me I couldn't leave the hospital unless they physically seen my ride home so they tried to force me against my will to leave the hospital.

Dr Jundial is nothing more than an egotistical joke of a doctor. As soon as it was asked that he be replaced as my doctor and after a long report was filed about how little he cares for or treats his patients, he ordered a psychiatric review. The nurses were mostly awesome but if you ever HAVE to come here, immediately request that Jokedial is not your doctor!</text>

5 hours in a moderately busy waiting room. Another 5-1/2 hours inside ER for roughly 15 minutes of test. Ignored on gurney for 1-1/2 hours. Finally after 90 minutes of sleep in previous 24 hrs, no food for 30+ hrs and sitting in their ER for 10-1/2 hours, I finally just walked out. One star is WAY too much for this horrible ER dept. I can honestly say this was one of the worse experiences of my life. Never again @ San Dimas Comm ER....never!<//Review>< pics>

My father was a patient recently and the care was excellent.  My sister and I took turns staying with him 24:7 at no time did he have anything better than 5 star care.  I have had family in UCLA Cedars and USC the nursing staff and food was equal if not better.  I would recommend SDCH to anyone needing routine hospitalization.</text>

HORRIBLE STAFF, MAJORITY OF NURSES NOT PATIENT OR UNDERSTANDING. I HAD A FAMILY MEMBER THERE DELIVERING BABY AND I WAS THE ONE ASKING QUESTIONS and ANSWERING THEM! I FEEL LIKE I COULD HAVE DELIVERED THE BABY! EVERY TIME A QUESTION WAS ASKED THE NURSES LOOKED IRRITATED THAT WE ASKED. THE PATIENT (MY FAMILY MEMBER), WAS ALSO INJECTED WITH A NEEDLE BY 'ACCIDENT' AFTER USING IT SHE KEPT IT IN HER HAND WHILE SHE DID OTHER STUFF, THAT'S WHEN SHE POKED THE PATIENT 3 TIMES BY ACCIDENT!! UNBELIEVABLE!  WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE, I'D RATHER DIE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD LET YOU DO THERE! OH AND BTW WE ARE LOOKING TO WRITE A LETTER OF GRIEVANCE BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW HOW THIS PLACE RUNS.< /Review>

By far the worst hospital. The Doctor was rude and made me feel like i was an idiot for going to the hospital. He didn't really give me time to ask him questions. He would come in tell me what he needed to and leave with out asking if i had questions. Also, while i was waiting i got a phone call and he rudely walked in and started talking to me ignoring the fact that i was on the phone. He didn't even stop to give me a chance to hang up.</Text>

<review>Screw you san Dumas ER. Just left at 2 am from ER with my 7yr old daughter who never got treated for 1rst to 2nd degree burn on her left hand. They gave  a room to a women and man who got there after us first. My 7yr old can't close her hand cause of pain and blister but the hospital felt that a man drinking a Coke and eating a snickers at 1:30am was a priority. Also the women eating hot cheatos wrapped in a blanket sharing Facebook stories with her significant other was a priority over a 7yr old with burns on her hand. Never again will I take my children to that hospital and I will make sure to put the hospital on blast on all social media especially to families with kids.

Ive waitied for nothing!!! I have had the BEST experience this time and once again believe in this hospital.  I was very very sick and feel confident with the care im recieving.

< Review>
My son went to this hospital for ER treatment. The treatment was ok but the person who was working at bill department was horrible. He was so defensive and not listening at all. My son goes to ER every year at different hospitals. All hospitals he went to before provided discount program if you want to pay all at once. However this hospital has no option other than paying full amount that is ridiculously high compared the treatment he had. My son was just lying down on the bed and get IV, check BP, and nothing else. He didn't need even urine test because he became fine when IV was done. The high bill is ok if the person at least was polite and knew how to treat customers. No more going this hospital for me.</Review>

Yet, instead of treating my wounds, the staff decided to subject me to psychiatric interrogation which eventually led to forced confinement.

The staff's conduct toward mental health patients is ethically and legally questionable. A contract psychiatrist there (Said Jacob, an Egyptian with a record of probation) smelled an opportunity to make some easy money and invoked the California law 5150 (involuntary civil commitment) so he could detain me to the psych hospital (Aurora Charter Oak) where he also works as a contractor, though I didn't need it at all.

Worse yet, the staff in the ER seriously violated the due process outlined in the law. They didn't inform me why exactly I was going to be detained, what hospital I was being sent to, and what the nature of my detention was. Throughout the whole process I was purposefully kept in the dark. They alternately used deception ("You'll only stay there for a night") and intimidation ("We can call the police!") just trying to get me committed to the psych hospital. At one point, a female staff member even started yelling at me like a schoolyard bully.

It wasn't until I was thrown into Aurora Charter Oak that I realized I was put on a 72-hour hold, the reason being that I was "a danger to myself" (huh?). After the 72-hour hold expired, I was additionally declared "a danger to others" (huh???) and put on a 14-day extension. Although I managed to get out of that hellhole on the 10th day, this whole experience left me traumatized.

If you are a person with mental health problems, DO NOT, under any circumstances, go to the ER at San Dimas Community Hospital or something awful will happen to you.</Review>< Date>

<text>★  I wish I could give zero stars. My daugher was taken to the emergency room by ambulance and had a Doctor treat her who was out of network even though the hospital is in network for my insurance. Apparently the Doctor can charge anything he wants and we are under contract to pay it, an in network doctor would accept the insurance payment as full payment. More specifically the Insurance company allows $385.00 for the service but the Doctor charges $837.00 which we had to pay him the difference since he is out of network. WHY would you have an out of network (Bluecross/blueshield) working in Emergency at an in network Hospital. So when you arrive at the hospital make sure you ask for the doctor on duty who accepts your insurance. If not get a ride to the next closest hospital. Total scam. Not to mention the doctor was aweful<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

We brought our 1 year old daughter in who had vomited twice at home and the staff was incredibly insensitive and tried doing everything they could to bill us for unnecessary treatments.  The doctor told us they couldn't treat her there and that we couldn't take her to Pomona Valley because "they were full" (which later our PCP said was a lie because she worked there that night).  They insisted on putting our baby in an ambulence and sending her to Fountain Valley way out past Anaheim.  We later learned that the only reason they sent her there (over an hour away from home when there were tons of closer hospitals including the one that we actually wanted), was because they were in the same network and were getting kickback referalls from the physicians at SDCH.

Needless to say we filed a dispute and were forced to trek all the way down there for a week as they had her on fluids and were "monitoring" her for an entire week.  End result?  No one knew what was wrong and she was fine.<//review>

I experienced exceptional skill and care during my recent out-patient operation from everyone, including Dr. David Wang, Dr. Joshi, Dr. Benson, Rosie, Pam, Kim, Susan, Crystal, Sai, and Angel, as well as the front office staff and pre-operation personnel.  Thank you all so much!<//Review>

<review>I had to take my wife in when she experienced some bleeding during her first trimester. The wait was ok and the Doctor was attentive. The nurses are a whole different story, the nurse/ultrasound tech told my wife to insert the ultrasound tube herself ??? and didnt provide any lube to help, this resulted in an inaccurate reading and we all thought (including the MD) that this was a miscarriage The next day I went to her OB/GYN who immediately told us she had a Polyp which caused the bleeding and the ultrasound performed at the ER was the cause. Later the nurse that performed the blood work pulled the IV out and left it on the bed, blood was all over the sheets???? So if you are looking for a decent doctor this ER is ok, but nurse wise they need to layoff a few people.</review>< Pictures>

<review>There are many things to get into on your own or if you have children. It's clean , the maintenance and up keep is a very nice change from some parks.

<Text>(Translated by Google) It is my favorite park, quiet, beautiful, we give the ducks bread, there is only one detail, it takes more cleaning in the fountain and something, I usually sit and read on a bench in front of the lake and it smells bad, only that occupies because the park is beautiful.

Es mi parque preferido, tranquilo, bonito, le damos pan a los patos, solo hay un detalle, ocupa más limpieza en la fuente y algo, yo suelo sentarme a leer en una banca frente al lago y huele mal , solo eso ocupa porque el parque está precioso.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<text>None of these reviews are actually for the museum (they are for the campground). The museum is AWESOME.  It has limited hours, but if you can make the 3.1+ mile 1,300 foot uphill hike it's worth it!! It's in the big white building with the Visitor Information sign. Lots of cool nature displays and old pictures.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMs5HF4W07rlREIu3kNAJLlyknpTiMwfsHEty4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP21vAaUHEmrxGcm_31CfNRBXjv8un4YWC4xeFH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Five star view of LA. Lots of campsites in the trees. Indoor visitor center. Easy hike up. Picnic tables, grills and free firewood. What's not to love?!</text>

<Review>Beautiful place to camp , to get up can be a bit challenging but so worth it. Bathrooms are clean ,free wood and internet as well . Free camping just need to get a permit and that u will be able to get it in the visitor center once u get to the top .</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTd2qktEkkOPDrKQfLW4gSUHQl_WoAIhFcW03k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3zYSUaQprQj0F9VHU3zIvbR9uReXDZ6YPMQCH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRzjGsHK1JIBibZRvqJugMgbqIzpMK0YZeDArF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3ELMDr2ckwUn2hmjcVi_t1B0680M_uRbmKXH8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ-cX6mdTAOQ1b39eUvQciUdRJ-Dmobteth8d3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Cute and tiny museum at the end of your hike to the top. Very informative about the surrounding nature. No one is inside, so it might look like it's closed. Just make sure to yanj at the door and check out the place.< /text>

Excellent workout. Straight up the fire service road for about 3 miles. Best to go early before the sun comes out strong since the road is fully exposed and has very little shade. Take plenty of water because it is not available once you get there. Keep in mind a 90 degree will sap your energy and hydration is a must. It takes about an hour to get up to Henninger Flats give or take a few minutes.</Text>

<review>Being on the lower end, just inside the Angeles Forest, you'll never be fully secluded here. These trails are very populated & on top on that very well maintained. Feeling the air shift cooler as you curve up, dipping into the pocket of the mountain.</review>< pics>

There is a "contributor" Tatiana Lopez that appears to have uploaded 2500+ photos and tagged them as being taken at Henninger Flats. They are NOT properly tagged... and I've exhausted reported as many as I can... but it will take forever! So just ignore her photos... there is a very obvious difference in her photos verses what others have posted/tagged.

For those Hiking up from Eaton Canyon... it is a challenging elevation climb, but an easy hike as the trail is quite clear and wide. The trail is the "fire road" that leads up to Henninger (which was repaired a number of years ago after a landslide took out large portions of the road (and mountain side)... I'm glad it was reopened... and for those wanting a big challenge you can continue up to Mt. Wilson if you're feeling bold!

Remember to "leave no trace" and keep your 10 essentials with you. This is still wild country with spiders, snakes, bears and mountain lions in the area. So please, don't treat your hike as if you're going to Tom Sawyer Island and Disneyland. You can get hurt if you're not being safe. People have fallen from ledges and been hurt (a few killed) so treat nature with respect and stay firmly on the trails.

Good, challenging hike. Its about 2.9 mi if you go through walnut trail. Henninger Flats is well kept. Clean area, spacious, and has a great view. The nature center is pretty imformative. Has info about the wildlife in the area, relics and a bit of history.<//Text>

<Review>This lovely campground is the border between the more commonly hiked lower part of the Toll Road and the more remote trail leading up to My. Wilson.  There is presently no potable water, but plans are being made to add some. Above this point, things keep getting better and better.< /Review><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c2dd2201383f4b:0x21496be732eb4eb3< /gmapID>< pictures>

No drinkable water was available, so I had to backpack two gallons for my campsite, in addition to all of the other camping equipment. Quiet and peaceful, even though you're not too far from the city.< /text>

A great place, with so much to see. Stop by the museum, or see some of the old artifacts from the old mining era. Don't forget to see camp fugi to the right it's a few steps more to a connecting trail which resumes the trail to Wilson. Have fun and stay hydrated</Text>

<Text>In May I made the move from Seattle to Los Angeles and it didn’t take long for me to start itching to get outdoors and explore. Unfortunately it took me a couple weeks to settle in and finally make time to get out. I started doing some research on recommended places to camp near LA and Henniger Flats was at the top of almost everyone’s list that I could find online. A short hike, free camping and not far from where I live; sold. Especially for my first camping adventure since making the move to sunny California.

Henniger Flats is located in the San Gabriel Mountains near Altadena, California. Directions on getting there are pretty simple coming from downtown LA.

The trailhead to Henniger Flats is located off N Altadena Drive. It’s not easy to spot but if you’re familiar with the area, you’ll probably have no problem finding it. If you’re heading to Henniger Flats for the night, you’ll have to pay attention to where you park because there’s not a lot of overnight or long-term parking at the trailhead. I personally parked down the street on N Altadena in the neighborhood. Just keep an eye out for parking signs and you’ll probably be ok.

When you reach the trailhead you’ll see a sign that reads, “The Henniger Flats Project.” You have to hike up  Mount Wilson Toll Road to get there. Initially it’s a little confusing to figure out which trail you need to be on to get there, at least it was for me. You’ll walk down the beginning of the trail and cross the white bridge. Once you cross the white bridge, stay to the left and head up until you reach Henniger Flats. It’s about a 3 mile hike and the incline gets steep at times. There are plenty of benches to rest at on the way up.

There’s no shade on the way up so it’s important to start your hike early if you intend on camping and have a heavy pack. Also bring an abundance of water. There is a visitor center and museum at Henniger Flats, but there’s no running water. Be prepared! I didn’t run into any wildlife and you probably won’t either since the trail is very popular and there seems to be a lot of foot traffic throughout the day. There are a few signs for rattlesnakes but I didn’t run into any.

After your 3 mile journey to the top, you’ve reached Henniger Flats. First thing’s first, you need to find the onsite LACFD Forester that’s on duty to check in. I read that you’ll be given a permit for camping and to use a stove, but I didn’t have to do that when I checked in for whatever reason. There was a cub scout clan doing some work at the campgrounds so I’m sure he was busy and distracted. After or even before you check in, you can check out the visitor center and museum to learn about Henniger Flats and the surrounding areas. It’s pretty neat.

Once you get checked in you’ll have to find your camping lot. There are 3 levels of camping at Henniger Flats. There’s a lower level campground near the visitor center and museum. It seemed pretty busy, so I walked to the upper and Fiji campgrounds. The forester actually recommended the Fiji campground area for a quieter environment and great place for setting up hammocks. He was absolutely right and if you’re looking for a quiet place to chillax, Fiji is the way to go.

Most larger camping lots have picnic tables and stoves to cook on. It’s worth noting there are about 15-20 camping lots in the upper and lower campgrounds. Fiji only has 3 camping lots, so you have to get there early to snag one. You can also call the forester head of time to get some insight on open camp lots. There’s plenty of shade once you get settled and the campgrounds are very well kept. There was no trash, the trails were well maintained and the views are phenomenal. There’s plenty of trails to check out after you get settled in.

Overall I had a great experience camping at Henniger Flats and I will certainly go again. #LosAngeles #Hiking #Outdoors< /Text></record></dataset><record>
<rate>5</rate><Review>Went camping at the campground. It's a few miles to hike up to and you have to carry everything in and out. The hike is not too hard but if you are carrying equipment then it quickly becomes a strenuous hike. The campground is beautiful and offers a fabulous view of LA. They have grills to cook in and make fires inside. No fires allowed outside of the grills. Free firewood is also available but water is not currently running.</Review>< gmap_id>

It's a 6-mile hike, up and back, from Eaton Canyon Nature Center — park for free! — at the end of which you'll have exercised (better health), left your troubles behind (better attitude) and given yourself peace of mind (better spiritual state). It's win-win-win-win! Make the time, and the world will be a better place.</text>

<Review>This is an awesome reward for a steep slanted hike/walk up above the Eaton canyon wash. With breath taking views and a campground, you can't help but just take it all in. There are various benches posted at all of the best Vista spots on your way up in case you need a breather or to get pebbles out of your shoes. It is an all packed dirt hike-walk so be sure to have some grippy shoes on. also at the top, there are restrooms and an old timey outhouse. Plus a museum with actual watch towers and other vintage items to check out. We also saw some HUGE silver squirrels!< /Review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Be careful, the last time I had a very bad experience, with the subject hiding in the bushes I was taking pictures.
You do not know what kind of people you can find in those places since there is no guard to watch the perimeter

Tengan cuidado, la última vez tuve una muy mala experiencia,  con sujeto que se escondía entre los arbustos  me estaba tomando fotos .

<Review>I have ordered delivery from this location instead of the one closer to me because they always made the sandwiches properly. This time we ordered 3 sandwiches and two of them had very little meat. The Clubhouse Melt had two very thin slices of turkey and one piece of ham, no bacon, I think I saw some cheese. It was like it may have been sitting around for awhile. The Ham and Cheese had one very small piece of swiss no tomatoes, didn't look appetizing. I called the store the girl that answered was very sweet and apologized, but I don't fell confident to spend so much money to have an order delivered that was so badly prepared. Sad that this happened, because they have been so good in the past.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>As I've said on other reviews.  I like pastrami.  Who doesn't?  I've had a love/hate relationship with Togo's from my first experience in the 1970's in Citrus Heights until the present.  It seems that the chain has difficulties between providing quality and providing less expensive sandwiches.    Every few years, prices go up, and quality with it.  Then it appears they choose not to raise prices again, and quality decreases for a few years until they raise prices again.  I've enjoyed Togo's pastrami sandwiches (#9 and #10) for many years in many locations, but at this time, it seems that they give you a lot of bread, and not much in the way of filling.  Honestly, I'd rather pay a bit more and get something with a bit more beef.  But on the other hand, what you do get it fairly good.  I say 3 stars.  Attached is a picture of one of their #10's front and back.  Lot of bread, not much filling.    But reasonably tasty.  From 12/6/2019.</text></record>

I went there on Saturday noon to pickup an order. A middle aged caucasian lady ( wearing short) showed an aggressive attitude towards me from the moment I entered the store... In the beginning I tried to ignore... Eventually, she threw the food bag on the desk infront of my face without saying one word like she's doing me a favor.... Another caucasian customer entered afterwards and she acted with her in a totally different manner with welcoming and friendly communications...

If you guys aren't friendly with people from a different culture, why don't you just put a sign on your store and we won’t bother you. Otherwise, it doesn't make any sense opening your doors for public and then picking customers based on background to insult them. Have some training for your employees that are suffering from such kind of mentality.</Review>

NO MASK POLICY.  I stopped at this location for lunch today and even though the staff all wore masks custmers are NOT  required to do so.  The customer in line immediately in front did not wear a mask but attempted to pull his jacket lapel over his mouth.  This was a feeble attempted since it did not cover his mouth or nose.  When I asked about their mask policy Noone said anythin.  We do not need stores like this in our community who don't care about their customers well being.<//text>

I do wonder however why they never employ non-Caucasian employees.</review>

Horrendous service, don’t bother with this place.
Ordered on Uber eats, they..took...forever
On top of that, my Uber driver called to me they ran out of the bread I ordered, which essentially meant they didn’t even bother making my sandwich before my driver got there.
ON TOP OF THAT, I paid extra $7 to make the sandwich bigger to a 9 inch, and it literally looked and tasted like a regular size.
Stay away for me, eat at jersey mikes instead, which has great service, prices, and delivery</text>

<review>I went to this Togo’s last Thursday because I like their sandwiches, but when I was in line with my mask on I look up and noticed that every employee working on the line making sandwiches were wearing masks. But, all three of them had the mask pulled down beneath their nose and one had her mouth and nose both exposed, so I turned and walked out. Just putting it out there. We all have choices,< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<review>Have for 40+ years enjoyed the food here. I have noticed here (as well as other places) the portions have gotten smaller and of course costs more but I guess that can't be helped as that's all over. This doesn't take away from the quality of the product or service.<//review><gmap_id>0x809b2107b21ad0f5:0x198e763ef600d9aa<//gmap_id>< time>

<username>ANGELA PONE<//username><user_id>116200185062851521163<//user_id><Text>Great sandwiches and great staff.  The reason for the 4 is because there is one staff member that doesn't smile and has no enthusiasm in her voice.  The guy that seems to be the manager is great.  And so is the rest of the staff.  Service is great too.
This location is in an older building and therefore the bathroom looks a little run down but it's clean and has everything you need.< /Text>< gmapID>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>I used to love TOGO's which makes this negative review so sad. I dont know what happened over the years but this is way too expensive for the quality received. My family spent $32 on 3 sandwiches. No meals. No drinks. No sides. Just 3 sandwiches. That's INSANE and it was poor quality. The pastrami was hardly chopped, it was fatty and very gristly (we basically only come here for pastrami sandwiches because they used to be so good). The chunks of meat were so large and dry that after chewing and chewing and chewing you would swallow it and a chunk of meat would be half in your mouth and half down your throat held together by gristle. We choked down our sandwiches and threw away half the meat in the sandwich. Very disappointing experience and won't be going to TOGO's again because of the outrageous price for such bad quality. You can get a better custom sandwiches for a better price at the Raleys deli, no joke.< /Text>< user_name>

I have been going here close to fifteen, maybe even twenty years (it has got to be around then!) and I have never once been disappointed. My order is always consistent, accurate, and fresh, because everything is made right in front of your eyes. The staff is friendly and always recognizes me and my family. TOGOs is wonderful.</text>

While the sandwiches are decent, the dining area was dirty. I was able to find 1 table that was relatively clean. All other tables were dirty and littered with lettuce on the tables and below them. The staff were pleasant, but the cleanliness of the place made it much less appetising.</Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Idk if this is something that is because they've recently gotten alot of new hires or theyve just slipped when it comes to their service. But this is the third time I've gone here recently... been a customer for years and now all of a sudden theyve forgotten how to make a sandwhich. They forgot to make my California club the right way. They up charged me for cheese and avacado and yet forgot to put either on... they forgot to toast 3 out of the 4 sandwiches we ordered toasted. I will NOT be coming back neither will the friends that I had previously recommended to them<//text>< pictures>

Unwelcoming, I walk in, there was two people ahead of me. Finished services with them I was next. They just start cleaning up never ask can they help me or anything. So I said something and she ask me why was I there? I almost lost it, just look at her and walk out. They clapped really rude and don't like Black's no customer service, respect, or consideration of others. I will never ever go back so so sad....< /Review>

Food was good their service not soo good. The employees there have no customer service skills they were complaining about customers infront of other customers. The store was dirty with food and wraps on the ground. The employees were grumpy, as we left my husband said "thank you, have a great day." .... no response.... I don't think we will go back there again.<//review>

BEWARE  DO NOT USE THIS  PLACE.....
So my partner  accidentally booked this place. we only saw, the review's  after...  stories of bed bugs, cockroaches, Unsecure  rooms and people living on-site  as  permanent residents  were plentiful. we thought  we would still give it a chance. Upon arriving  the town seemed pretty desolate, isolated and forgotten. felt like being in a time warp. However It had a certain charm.

All seemed well that's until we noticed  no additional latch or secondary  lock on the door. The window in the bath room was unsecure and faced a liquor store that was open most of the night.we had to improvise  further security measures. But even after  all that   we still gave it a chance.

But late at night, as we tried to sleep we noticed...  bed bugs on the  mattress and inaddition  my partner  found cockroaches  in the  bathroom crawling all over our toothbrushes 😡.It  being midnight we decided to sleep  in our  car rental.  How are places like these still  allowed to do business  on booking...?? poor tourist  being subjected to  third world like treatment. I never had this issue in india. Shame  on you booking.<//review>

<Review>Room was dirty.  No pen & paper.  No instructions, rules or info about motel or surrounding area.  Office locked with written instructions on door telling how many times to ring the doorbell, depending on why you are there.  Greeted with an angry manager, yelling at me because I didn't wait long enough for him, before I began to walk away.  I had prepaid reservations or I would have kept on walking.  I relunctantly went back to the office to ask for a receipt, internet password and cleaning product.  I was greeted again by the angry manager that provided me with the password and a hand written receipt from a generic receipt book, without the motel name or info.  I was not surprised when he told me he had no cleaning products and no pen that I could use in my room.  I can't be sure, but I think most of the odd characters around there were living there.  There's plenty more I could complain about, but this should give one a good idea of my experience.  Maybe because it was one of those last minute deals.  I would not recommend this place.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>My eyes got weary and my head went light on the way to "Hotel California" and I had to find a place to stay.
Clean, comfortable and convenient describes this place. I met the coolest guy on the whole trip "I assume Tom by reading the reviews". Took my wife and infant in for the night rested up and kept a good memorable experience. Thanks guys, manager, cleaning staff and the pple staying there.
I couldn't have made it another minute on the road 5hat night and I called in, no rez and the guy put us up without the nickel and dime.
This was the only non corporate hotel on the whole trip from Cleveland to Bakersfield and I would choose it anytime for the next run!!!

Thanks guys EXCELLENT SERVICE!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80ce2371b9d6a98f:0x51ecbd7753d0db5e<//Gmap_id></record>

Then after leaving air on for 4hrs the room was still hot and the manger  told me we could ck out tomm morning. The pool had no water in it and the worst there was mouse dropping on the floor in room where the mamger said it was bugs but they didnt move.  We ck out after 4hrs. Needs to be shut down.

This is definitely a budget place. Having said that, our room was recently renovated with new flooring, paint, and a completely redone bathroom. Free wifi wasn't bad from our room, which was close to the office.<//Review>

If you like thin walls and armies of cockroaches in the bathroom then you will be right at home. The manager was perfectly nice and the room was cleanish and passably maintained, but the bugs and the noise make this a complete pass.< /Text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><date>1487614902804< /date><pics>None</pics><review>More of a halfway house than a hotel. Rundown hotel in a depressing shell of a town that might have been many many years ago. Bed has to be at least 30 years old. Original carpeting (not a good thing) and unintended vintage tangerine colored bathtub. I slept with only a sheet and upon close investigation did not find any evidence of bedbugs. The comforter automatically goes on the floor. Wore shoes to bathroom. Did not use towels. Just ick all around. This motel has to be removed from listings. It seems to be a home for down on their luck locals and appears to be rented out by the hour.< /review>< Response>

<review>I will never stay here again! The outside looks like a crackhead hotel. There is a pool with no water with a broken run downed fence. I opened the door to see an ok furnished room, but as I looked down a cocaroch ran passed me. The bathroom wasn't cleaned well, and there was old coffee still inside the maker. Grosss!!! I know this city isn't great or attractive at all, but when you have out of towners come at least have you're motels in decent shape, people dont stay here!<//review>< date>

BEDBUGS. Found hordes of these little terrors in the mattress, left immediately. Hotel was impossible to get in touch with the night of the problem, but I was able to get money refunded the next day. Stay away.< /Text>

Clean and large rooms. Place is a little run-down on the outside, but it's the inside that counts, right? Great prices too.< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Terrible receptionist management.
We were attended by a man connected to an oxygen machine, without any education. He gave us two keys to different rooms both occupied. Imagine the surprise. The third key did not open the door. He did not apologize at any time.
The room was clean the part that looked but under the beds there was a lot of dirt.
The tub had live bugs.
The air conditioning a scandalous noise.
The mattress was stained like rust.
I am surprised that booking allows advertising to this type of establishments ....

(Original)
Pésima gestión de recepcionista.
Nos atendió un señor conectado a una máquina de oxígeno, sin ninguna educación. Nos dio dos llaves de habitaciones diferentes ambas ocupadas. Imaginen la sorpresa. La tercera llave no abría la puerta. No se disculpó en ningún momento.
La habitación estaba limpia la parte que se veía pero debajo de la camas había mucha suciedad.
La bañera tenía bichos vivos.
El aire acondicionado un ruido escandaloso.
El colchón estaba manchado como de óxido.
Me sorprende que booking permita anunciarse a este tipo de establecimientos....<//text><rate>1</rate><username>Yolanda A.<//username>< userid>

The management here is whatever, but the people you work with can be a hit or miss, most of them are friendly though. The production lines are hell, the portioning tables are alright, and working in delivery makes the day go by faster (management in delivery is actually not too bad) If you want a steady paycheck with OT every week then this place would do. Would I recommend this place to friends? Simple answer is no</text>

3rd shift Production Associate...
Both, my wife and I have established a long standing relationship since back in August of 2018. We've both witnessed first hand, the company's development and truly monumental growth in all aspects of the local branch from: the significant increases in weekly production goals and corresponding hiring new personnel to meet said goals.

* It's been quite the RUN but, they've ALWAYS managed to make it FUN!!!

* ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY, MIGHTY NIGHT CREW!!! Say it LOUD, say it PROUD...

* Safety - FIRST!!!
* Quality - ALWAYS!!!
* Homechef, on ME - Homechef, on 3

Do not work at the San Bernardino location. I have a family member that just started working here, they do not care about their employees at all. The work schedule changes every day, some days you work 8 hrs other days 10 or 12 hrs and your days off aren't a guarantee. Employees still people's personal belongings. Family member let management knowledge that more than once something was stolen from them, and today their jack for working in the freezer got stolen and they didn't care. I know we are in a pandemic and people are desperate for income but don't treat your workers like livestock!  Google review please make it so a business can receive zero stars! Report these people to the labor department, tell the local and major News about this place, shut it down!< /Text>

After being a customer for 2 plus years I decided to call and let them know the shipment was damaged.

< review>
Thought this place was a great place to work but i was wrong. My friend and I started working here in the beginning of the month and on memorial day before the shift started he got permission to leave early by the general manager i think her name is Jennifer. Later on one guy he was working next to left after 1st break without saying anything so my friend had to do twice the job till lunch time. So before my friend left he let one of the leads Andrew know whats going on. Few hours after the shift ends, he gets a text saying to no longer show up with no explanation for why. All they told him was that his name is on a list of people from all three shifts but that still doesn’t tell him anything. Today someone he knows that works there told him Andrew left a complaint... so i guess they want the workers to be quiet and never speak up or else your name will get put on a list smh. If there was a misunderstanding to where they thought my friend just left without saying anything then they need to investigate better before letting people go since he filled out a full paper before the shift even started. That situation made me no longer want to work here anymore since my friend did nothing but work hard and show up every day. Most workers also don’t care about following rules like when products fall on the floor they are not supposed to be picked up and used but they use it anyways and paying customers have no idea if their food ever touched the floor or not.<//review>

<text>I’ve been using Home Chef for 10 months and love it as does my husband. The meat is always so tender, the recipes easy to follow, and I enjoy cooking for the first time in my life. I always had a problem with making a meal because I was missing one ingredient or another. Now I have no problem putting a meal together that tastes absolutely delicious. Easy peasy after 50 years of trying to make a nice meal, now it’s possible. And the home express is a nice addition when you just want to throw a quick meal together. 15 minutes and you’re eating. Yep. This is a great meal delivery service. Great choices and fresh products. Thanks Home Chef.< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dcab63ec486b63:0x48b2b4959b28272b<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<date>1573725899755< /date><Rate>1< /Rate><text>I was happily using Home Chef for about a year. I have medical issues, and due to those issues I am a vegetarian. All of a sudden Home chef stopped giving three vegetarian options. They have two vegetarian options, and an "entree" salad option. Just because I'm a vegetarian doesn't mean I want to eat an unsatisfying salad for dinner each week. I want my money's worth too. Meat eaters get multiple choices, so disappointing. I unfortunately had to cancel.</text>< pictures>

<text>Its a nice place to work. Having a job here is what you make it. The people are cool, but not all of them. You can either come in with a great attitude and ambition to work hard, or come in dreading it. Its up to you. I like it.</text>< Pics>

I really appreciated the down to earth Superiors I was Blessed to work with on 3rd shift (Noemi, Isac, and Maro)All the team leads were cool 😎 . My illness was a misfortune and got the best of me however if at all able I would definitely reapply and work here again. I highly recommend as a work place and as a meal solution for anyone looking for quality and freshness.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

< Review>
After the first week, I realized it wasn't for me and I logged into to cancel. It asked me why I wanted to cancel, so I know they received my cancelation. I thought I was done, but they charged my card and sent out another week's meals! I didn't even get to select the food this time! Now I have all of this food I will never eat! I guess I will be taking it to homeless people this week. This was not planned in my budget, as I had canceled. There is nobody available to call after 6 pm Central time. This is a horrible way to do business!</Review>

My experience with home Chef was outstanding I have delivery I got you a day early and they took me in and unloaded me man that was just great the parking is at the best you have to test your driving skills but I have to admit that I was verily verily amazed and surprised that they took me in a day early so I can get unloaded and be about making my money wish I could give them 10 stars 🤗🤗🤗<//Review>

<response>None< /response><Text>Do not work here if you want to be treated unfairly. This company doesn't care about their employees. The managers or HR do not help you with anything instead they turn against you and try everything possible to get you fired. If you speak up for yourself you will get fired. They have an upstairs storage room where they should not have any employees working there due to the regulations of the roof. There is holes everywhere and the floors are cracking as you move the boxes and seem like the boxes will go through the ceiling eventually. It is over 110 degrees up there and they don't even have a spinning fan up there. They have you doing a count and you need a personal email to submit a count but they don't give you a personal email you have to use other people emails because they don't want to give you a raise. OVERALL DONT WORK HERE IF YOU WANT TO GET TREATED UNFAIRLY AND THEY MANAGERS AND HR KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO THE EMPLOYEES!<//Text>< Name>

< review>
(Translated by Google) Awful place to unload !!! They don’t want to work. Unload in a chaotic sequence. They can first unload several trucks that arrived after you, and only then proceed to unload your truck. But that's not all. Waiting for documents after unloading more than 2 hours !!! If you could put 0 stars - that would be their fair rating !!!

(Original)
Ужасное место для разгрузки!!! Работать не хотят. Разгружают в хаотичной последовательности. Могут сначала разгрузить несколько траков, которые приехали после Вас, а только потом приступить к разгрузке Вашего трака. Но это не все. Ожидание документов после разгрузки более 2 часов!!! Если бы можно было поставить 0 звёзд - это была бы их справедливая оценка!!!< /review>

< review>
After years of ballet, modeling, pregnancy, and now my little one jumping on my back after standing on my feet all day; I developed chronic pain that became unbearable. After my first appointment with Dr. Tyler, I started feeling so much better. Over time and consistent treatment, my back has become more aligned; and I notice it in everything that I do. They are so professional, attentive, and genuinely care about their patients well being. It is always such a pleasant experience. Highly recommend!<//review>

Core chiropractic is amazing! I was always afraid of going to the chiropractor and held off for many many years. I am so glad I came here. The staff is amazing and the chiropractors actually educate you and take a holistic approach In their care. Are used to have chronic back pain and now I don’t. I feel better, I live better, and I Wish I would have done this sooner. I will tell all my friends and family and highly recommend core chiropractic.<//Text>

Dr. Tyler is very professional and the staff is friendly. The office is extremely clean and modern. I highly recommend Core Chiropractic!! My daughter and I have been getting adjusted by Dr. Tyler for a few years now, and have never felt better.< /Review>

<review>Been going to Core Chiropractic for over three years. In fact my entire family goes: wife, children, parents. We all enjoy the care and attention we receive. Dr Tyler approaches each patient individually, defining a care plan based their needs. Highly recommend.</review><Date>1623375752791< /Date><response>None</response></record>

Thoroughly impressed. Incredibly kind and professional, they took X-rays first, and at next visit the adjustment fixed pain I had from a pinched nerve. I can’t wait to go back!< /Text>

<username>Jen Davidowitz< /username><text>Dr Tyler and Natalie (office manager) are amazing! I started coming here for more preventative care as I’m 32 now and haven’t been assessed or had chiropractic treatment since high school. My husband started coming here first after throwing out his back in the same spot 4 times in the past 18 months. They very obviously care about internal health, long term treatment/maintenance and really focus on individual care. All of my questions and concerns are addressed, and when I’ve asked something Dr Tyler wasn’t 100% on he made sure to do more research and follow up with me on the next visit. One of my favorite things here is also their flexibility and understanding of my schedule. It’s the perfect balance of helping me stay on track with my treatment but accommodating my inconsistent work shifts. I’m already sleeping better, the area I hold stress in my back feel less strained, I don’t wake up as stiff and it has helped me become more aware of my posture on a daily basis. I highly recommend, and appreciate core chiropractic!!!<//text><Response>{'time': 1607360201990, 'text': 'Thanks Jennifer!

Core Chiropractic is an amazingly caring institution that tailors remedial and maintenance regimens to each patient to bring relief and insure an optimum quality of life.  Dr Brett Lukas is very adept at diagnosing and developing treatment regimens to address debilitating skeletal issues.  He has brought significant relief to both my wife and myself and is highly recommended.</Review>

<Text>I tweaked my back one day and wanted to have it checked out. By the recommendation of a friend of mine I called Core up and asked to see Tyler. Natalie was great and set me up with an appointment asap. I went down there got an xray and an initial adjustment that felt great, even coming off an injury it helped a ton right off the bat. Went back a couple days later to review the xrays and found not only my back was a little tweaked (probably from years of neglect) but also that my neck had lost it's natural curve. Tyler came up with an initial treatment plan to start getting my back and neck back into optimal alignment. I had never received any chiropractic treatment before so wasn't sure what to expect. I decided to move forward and after a little over a month I noticed I had more flexibility than I've had in years, less frequent stress headaches from work. I'm really glad it wasn't a serious injury that led me to take an interest in my spinal health and I will definitely recommend anyone I know whether you suffer from chronic pain or not, you may notice benefits that you didn't realize were there! Thanks again to Natalie and Tyler for helping get my back, back on track!<//Text>< pictures>

A very friendly and professional atmosphere with state of the art equipment!  Director Jena takes care of scheduling and assisting all the clients with their needs upon arrival.  Dr. Lukas welcomes you right away and knows how to address all concerns I have had!  From the time you enter and go on the leander table and get adjusted, you can be in and out within 10 minutes!  They take walk-ins too.  Very convenient being right off the 405 freeway.< /text>

Dr. Lukas gave me a very thorough examination and explanation about the back pain I was experiencing. I  let him know I was from out of the area and he told me he would find someone in my area to recommend. I was able to go one more time before my trip was over and he gave me a recommendation along with a copy of my Xrays. I am already feeling much better.

< Review>
In just a few short visits with Dr. Lukas I've seen a tremendous difference in my neck and back!! I was terrified of chiropractors and I just bit the bullet and came in. He made me feel so comfortable I wasn't scared anymore! Did I mention it feels amazing!<//Review>

Coming to Core Chiropractic team for over 6 months.  Couldn't sleep or exercise  due to a serious L5 back problem.  Within two months Dr. Lukas got me up and running.  I now see him weekly to stay on track. Thanks again Core Chiropractic!</text>

<review>I was so hesitant to see a chiropractor (due to bad past experiences) but my daughter introduced me to Dr. Lukas @ Core Chiropractic and I’m so glad! This group of doctors know their stuff and also take the time to educate you thoroughly before treating you. I am so looking forward to healing!!< /review><Time>1508452241055</Time>< name>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Core Chiropractic is awesome.  The staff is amazing starting with Jena who first greets you when you walk in the door.  I've been seeing Dr. Tyler for a couple years now and he is extremely knowledgeable.  Most people think you only need to see a chiropractor if you injured your back in a car accident or sports injury etc.  But, they do way more than that at Core.  They really make sure you are able to live a healthy life.  I personally saw them when I had no pain or anything.  I just wanted to get checked out and sure enough my hips were out of alignment and I had a slight reverse curvature at the top of my neck.  After seeing Tyler for a couple years he's straightened me out.  PS. I heard they're getting brand new massage chairs from Brookstone for the lobby!!! ;-)< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

A week ago I had woke up with an unrelenting *kink* in my neck that traveled both down to my shoulder and up to my head. That morning I immediatly made a visit with my local chiropractor. He gave me an adjustment and it helped but I didn't "get it all." There was still such discomfort at the end of the day that I made a return visit to him that evening. Same result, I felt better but not great and when I woke up the following day, nothing had changed so I went back again - 3rd time in 2 days.. I went through my week and continued my workouts but there was always something there still. I returned for a 4th time on Thursday and the result was yet again, the same; better than when I walked in, but not great.
This weekend I was fortunate enough to be attending a seminar with Dr. Lukas. After a couple grouling workouts on Fri and Sat morning, my head, neck and shoulder were still bothering me and I asked if he could take a look at it. After a careful evaluation, Dr. Lukas gave me the most dynamic and EFFECTIVE adjustment I have ever received. The pain was gone almost instantly. the muscles relaxed and I could tell immediately that I was functioning better.
Its been 48 hours since he adjusted me and I still feel fantastic. I would not only encourage but DEMAND that you seek out Dr. Lukas and his team if you any desire at all to be better, move better, function better and FEEL better.
Dr. Lukas, I can't thank you enough.</text>

<Text>Sean has brought the inland empire the best quality of both fresh sushi and a great environment.
After trying from place like Martinis, one spot, Takumi among other locations; Sushi Arigato Trumps them all. Sean is an artist, nowadays I just sit at the bar and he knows exactly what I want and need, and all rolls are varied. This is hands down the best location in town, and perhaps in the region. Thank you Sean and staff for always providing elite service. I could over sell this place and it will always over perform. Come here.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpQRdZxwvNNxQAz32y2wEGG5raB2wTlCQ7L5rh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

Horrible horrible horrible customer service . Salmon roll over cooked and dry. Sushi taste alone is terrible. Plus they leave the roll 3/4s empty. There are plenty sushi places to eat and this is not one</Text>

Friendly staff. Prices are definitely worth it and filling. If you're not much of a sushi person there's a kitchen in the back with some cooked foods. Chicken teriyaki that sort of food. Not sure how it tastes but the sushi is great.</Review>

Great sushi and Japanese fare. I ordered sashimi and got 6 pieces of tasty halibut. Reasonable prices. Fried food and soba noodles available. Good parking, free. Worth seeking out and if you dont know what to order, let the chef decide by going "omakase." He will not disappoint.</text>

Friendly staff who are also Star Wars fans. We brought in our light up Lightsaber chopsticks for the occasion.  Food was reasonably priced. Simple decor and very spacious restaurant. Of course the food was good. The sushi tasted fresh and decorative. The force was strong with this sushi.</text>

<Review>Great sushi, great price, great service. Waitress was very friendly and helpful, and although I didn't sit at the bar the chef seemed pretty friendly too. The rolls we had tasted great. I would definitely come again.<//Review><Date>1456378858362< /Date><UserId.>100573785506275641130</UserId.>< resp>

<review>At its new location, the environment is a bit stark. The booths are okay to sit at, but the lighting is very harsh. Service is very pleasant, and on a Saturday night - remarkably fast. But this is no substitute for Kishi. Some of the fish tasted off - hints of vinegar. Prices are quite low and the fried soft shell crab is well presented. But the rolls have to be eaten with lots of wasabi.<//review>< date>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Best sushi I've eaten in California.  You have to try their hamachi (yellowtail).  It used to be my favorite when I was stationed in Japan almost 40 years ago.  Arigato's has that buttery melt in your mouth flavor that I remember from Japan.  Will be back for more!<//text>< pictures>

Picked up some vegetarian food for dinner and was trying it for the first time. Person who answered phone was easy to talk with and took the order right away. We picked up 15-20 minutes later and staff had it ready to go. Nice staff and enjoyable looking place to try eating in at next time. I didn't see a patio so we'll have to leave the dog at home to come here though.

Food was good. We got Avocado cut rolls, veggie cut rolls, and tamago (egg) sushi. All were tasty. Rice was fine. My favorite sushi rice is from Hayato in Claremont but this one was better than most in the area.

It's likely going to be my go to sushi place near our house now.<//Text>

Excellent service from Joseph. I forgot my gate password one day, lost my lock keys the next and Joseph never made me feel like I was inconveniencing him or putting him out.  He was courteous and forthcoming with the solution for me to complete the job I needed to do. Thank you Joseph!<//Text>

<user_id>115582507818646130719</user_id><text>I used Big E Self Storage for over 6 years and had nothing but positive experiences. Besides their very affordable rates, their customer service is beyond exceptional. When I closed out my unit my lock key broke and I was panicking until the manager Joe assured me he could cut the lock off for me in no time and at no charge. He stuck around to make sure I could get my door open and when the door was stuck because a heavy box had fallen against it he worked tirelessly with me to get it open. Joe even offered me a new complimentary lock if I needed it since I didn’t have another one with me on hand. Definitely some of the best customer service I have had anywhere. I can’t recommend Big E highly enough.<//text><username>Kate R< /username>< Pictures>

We came into the office yesterday just to inquire and the Manager was already in the process of helping 2 other people out. She was very polite and told us she would be right with us. Everyone she was helping all needed storage, so she took all of us out on the property and showed each of us our options at the same time. She handled the situation perfectly. We were pleased with her professionalism and dedication. Especially since it was pouring rain throughout it all. Great job Amber 👍</Review>

Amber is awesome. I was in a bind and needed storage fast. She's was able to find me a locker that would work for what I had and the price range that I needed. She also gave me a move in special to take 20% my rent for a whole 5 months. So I was ecstatic that it worked out as well as it did. All around great experience. Thank you Amber for bringing my stress level down to a minimum.</review>

Amber helped us today and the visit was a very good experience. She was friendly, funny, outgoing and professional. The storage is close to the freeway and the units are all drive up, so it's easy to access.

Been here a couple months and I am still impressed with the way things are run here, plus the Manager couldn't be any better at her job. Amber is awesome!< /review>

Excellent customer service. Amber is great, the units are clean, lots of security. I recommend going to Big e all the way if needing storage. I have been here for about 6 months now and I can't complain. You can't go wrong! Good move-in specials right now!!!

I have been here almost 6 months now and the staff is great and my things are secure. I have no complaints and I will recommend Big E storage to all my family and friends.</Text>

<Text>UPDATE:

I couldn't ask for a better storage facility. I have been renting for almost a year and I love it here. My stuff is safe and secure, Amber (The Manager) is easy to communicate with and this place is very affordable. Big E is highly recommended.

Yesterday, I called to get some prices and ended up making a reservation. As soon as I hung up the phone my phone rang. It was the Manager of Big E following up with me on the reservation I had just made. I liked that she was so quick and the fact that she let me know a break down of fees and about having insurance and telling my exactly what I would need before coming. Then when I went to the property, it was impossible to leave with out getting a unit. The place is close to my house. The units were clean and they have tons of security cameras. On top of that, the customer service and professionalism was a 10 out of a 10. Thanks Amber.<//Text><user_name>Joseph Rodriguez<//user_name><Resp>{'time': 1542734303200, 'text': 'You just made our day, Joseph! We’re thrilled you had such a positive experience at our facility.

Amber has a great sense of care and leadership. She was empathetic to things that we're going through in life right now, that lead us to needing storage. We got a tour of the property and was shown our options so that we could choose the right size for what we have. She was very thorough in answering all the questions that I had and the leasing process was super easy. If anyone is needing to store anything, I suggest that Big E is the best place to go to. THANKS AMBER!😁👊👌<//Text>

Excellent pricing, wide drive aisles and all the units are drive up units so very easy access. The Manager is very thorough and transparent, I very much liked her stern but honest attitude. I have been here almost 2 months now and I still love it. Every time I go to my storage I can depend on Amber to either smile and wave, or stopping to ask how I'm doing. She really cares about her customers. I would recommend using Big E as your GO 2 place if you ever need storage. Ask for Amber... Did I mention she's awesome?!<//review>

I am an auction buyer and I have been to a lot of different facilities. Big E is one of the most organized facilities I've been too. Amber helped me and she already had the paperwork ready for me. She made the process easy and quick. That's much appreciated in a business like this. I recommend Big E storage to all auction buyers.</Review>

It's hard now a days to find good quality customer service and Amber exemplifies all aspects of it. I would rent at Big E just for that alone, but on top of that the prices are competitive and all the units are drive ups. Good Job!👍 I also wanted to update my review to say  that I haven't had a  better experience  anywhere else and Big E is highly recommended. Thanks again< /text>

<review>I visited a few storage places and Big E was the best one as far as price and customer service goes. I also liked the fact that the units weren't sheet rock. I have had my stuff stolen before through the sheet rock walls at a storage facility a few years back. These units are all metal. Thank you Amber for finding the unit size that is best for what I have to store and thank you for your patience with me during this stressful time. I recommend Big E for your storage place.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Ask for Amber, she helped us rent a unit and she was super great! Professional, kind and welcoming. The prices are great as well. I called around to several different facilities and they were either outrageously over priced or the ones that were a tiny bit cheaper were unpleasant or the facility was not well kept. So I am very happy with resulting in picking Big E as my storage go to place. I recommend Big E hands down to all my family and friends.< /text><username>Cecei Morse< /username>< Gmap_id>

<text>UPDATE: So, I will leave my first initial review down below, but since that first experience, I've had several more experiences with the staff, and with Big E Storage, and I've honestly been blown away. I continue to receive great service time and time again and will continue to keep coming back! The staff is very helpful, but one in particular, Genevieve, is absolutely outstanding. She's always super professional and will go out of her way to make sure all of your needs are taken care of! DEFINITELY recommend! Go in and speak with her!

Initial experience: I came in a few days ago and had such a great experience! I received the absolute BEST customer service you could imagine. Genevieve was not only professional, but she was very knowledgeable and answered all of my questions! I will definitely recommend Big E to all of my family and friends!<//text>< Pictures>

Amber helped me when I came into the office. She was by herself and had other customers she was helping. She was very polite and professional and said she's be right with me. After finishing up with the other customers, she thankedme for my patience and shook my hand to introduce herself. I thought the process was very simple and the prices were pretty reasonable. I was pretty impressed with my experience at Big E.</review>

I also liked the fact that the inside unit walls are made of metal and not sheet rock. I have been to some storage's where they have drywall with extreme water damamge and with metal unit walls it's less likely to be broken through.  Thanks again<//Text>< Pictures>

I came in yesterday to rent a unit and when I walked in I was immediately welcomed. Amber took me out on a tour of the property, where I was able to see the different sizes available. She made sure I was going to rent the one that suited me needs. The office smelled nice and the grounds were clean. Overall.. GREAT experience.<//Review>

UPDATE: I love this place! As the time goes by, the more I see when it comes to exceptional customer service. The Manager has gone out of her way to help me more than once. Thanks Amber!

First Review: Amber is just awesome. She's friendly, professional and she cares about her customer's. Anytime I need anything, she is always willing to help. Great location and very decent prices. A place you can count on. Big recommendation for this place. Go to Big E Storage and ASK FOR AMBER! :-)<//Text>

Amber helped me the other day and I was very impressed with her presentation and professionalism. I was greeted and welcomes pretty much at the door and she made sure that I felt like my business was important to her. Move in specials are going on at Big E right now, so go on down to Newton Rd and ask for Amber.< /Review>

Everybody in my family that has needed storage in the past, has come to Big E to store their belongings. They always have specials and there prices are good. Amber the Manager is friendly, helpful and answered all my questions thoroughly. I recommend going to Big E! Also don't let me forget to throw in the fact that they have referral bonuses.< /Review>

I was pretty amazed about the quality of care and empathy I received from the Manager Amber today. I went into the office very stressed and frustrated about the situation that I'm in right now. And with so much on my plate, it was nice to see things finally looking up. I felt relieved when I left and it felt good knowing that my stuff will be safe, for an affordable pice. Plus now I'll have one less thing to worry about. Thanks< /text>

I showed up at Big E today not knowing that they close early on Sundays. The Manager was already closing up and just locked the doors when I pulled up. With me already being in a stressful situation with having to move, I couldn't help to ask myself what else could go wrong. I walked up to the office and told her that I needed to rent a unit and asked if she could please help me. With out even thinking about it and without hesitation, she said she had no problem helping me. She showed me around and moved me into a unit right then and there. I can't say thank you enough for taking the extra time to help me. It's not too often that you go to a business and actually feel like they actually care. Amber, you are a life saver. I appreciated you then  and I still appreciate you now. I am still renting here and every time I'm on the property or she sees me at my unit, she always says hello and asks me how I am doing and tells me if there is anything I need to let her know. She goes above and beyond what is expected for her customers :-)<//Text>

I am very happy that I chose Big E as my storage place. I received the unit that I wanted in the price range I was shooting for. Amber was very welcoming and friendly. She made me and my kids laugh so hard our stomachs were hurting. I felt good when I left, knowing that I made the right decision. I recommend Big E storage to anyone needing storage. I have been renting a unit at Big E for 3 months now and I love it here. I am just as happy now or more than the first day I came here (and I was already impressed then) so that's hard to do.< /Review>

<Text>Great place. Amber is awesome! I've been at Big E for 3 months now and I like to update  everyone when I do reviews. Because Sometimes things happen and you never really know. I can't complain. My stuff is secure and safe. The customer service is still fantastic. I don't think I've ever drove through the gate or been seen on the property with out the Manager waving at me or asking how my day is going.<//Text>< Pics>

Now after being blown away with such improvement and meeting the Manager, I am so glad we came back. I recommend Big e for storage.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Great prices on multiple sized units. I went there originally just to ask a few questions and I left with a leased unit and a reservation for another one. Amber was very informative and answered all my questions that I had. I couldn't ask them for anything more than the service that I already receive.<//Review>

I've had a storage at big E since October and I don't plan on ever using any other storage facility besides big E if needed in the future. Amber has been awesome since the beginning. Her professionalism and kindness beats all other business professionals at storage facilities I've dealt with in the past.</Review>

UPDATED REVIEW:
I've been renting here for about 7 months. I didn't think that I would still be needing storage, but It's been hard lately. I am super pleased that this is the place that I chose to keep my stuff at. It's nice knowing that with everything going on in life, that at least my stuff is safe and secure. Also, Amber couldn't be a better Manger.  Thnx again!

Great experience here. Amber greeted me with a smile, showed me around and was very understanding and caring of my needs. Been having a rough time and she really took care of me. I recommend Big E storage for anybody needing to rent a storage space.</review>

I've rented at a few facilities in the past and have had problems along the way, so I was skeptical when I showed up at Big E. But I was pleasantly surprised. Amber was professional and very up front about policies and requirements to rent and she went through the whole renting process for me with out any questions asked. I will review again in a few months, but I hope I can say at the end of it that there is always a first time for everything.< /text>

Absolutely the BEST customer service you can ask for. Amber was professional, very knowledgeable and informative. She had a great attitude and was very welcoming. The units are clean with wide drive isles and they are all drive up units, which makes it easier to access.< /review>

< review>
It was a definite relief after leasing a storage locker today. It took a lot of weight off of my shoulders knowing that have a place to store my things, which was one thing I can mark off my list. I got a $1 move in special (which was fantastic) since things are rough right now. The manager instantly greeted me and was quick to help me. She made sure I felt secure and reassured me that I came to the right place. The leasing is on a month to month basis which is great, since I'm only needing storage short term. The process was easy and I was out of there in no time. Amber thank you for your help and your patience and I just want to say that having Amber here representing Big E is a smart decision and it says a lot to me about this company.< /review>

< Review>
I've rented lockers before at other facilities and didn't have the best experience with a lot of them, so I'm very skeptical. But when I went there, I was greeted immediately with a smile. The gal Amber introduced herself as the Manager and shook my hand. How welcoming!!! You don't find that anywhere. Excellent prices... cheapest in town I think and everything there was so nice and clean and kept up. I recommend Big E if you ever need storage!</Review>

Great prices, close to my house and Amber made the whole lease/renting super easy. The units inside actually go up pretty high, so there is a lot of room to stack. I'm glad I went there. 1 less thing to stress about during this stressful time in my life. I recommend Big E!!!

I have rented a storage unit from a different facility before, and comparing them to Big E there is no comparison. Their pricing and specials are very competitive and reasonable. The site is clean, I did not see any rodents or bugs in my storage unit or on the property all together. They have great security and know what is going on at all times so I felt more at ease storing my entire home here in their storage facility. Access going in and out of the facility is very easy, I never once had a problem getting in or out or my pin not working. Ashley the on site manager is extremely helpful, and flexible with your needs. She can answer any question you have and is very eager and willing to help you in any way. I particularly asked about rats getting into the unit and she offered to put some type of a packet in my unit to help ensure that did not happen. She is very friendly and easy to talk to. Unlike my past experience at the last storage place I rented from the employees were on their personal phones while assisting me and just plain rude. I did not get any of that while renting from BIG E! Her assistant in the office was also very friendly and helpful, it's good to know that not only the manager but all other employees are knowledgeable and eager to help you.  From my initial phone call to ask about their specials and pricing to my move out I was very pleased with BIG E and how they make sure customer service is their main priority!. I would HIGHLY recommend them! Especially since I've rented from a couple other storage facilities in the Stockton area, and can vouch for BIG E.  Give them a call! They're the BEST in the Stockton area, you will not be disappointed!<//Review>

Big E came was recommended to me by a family member, so I went and checked them out. All drive up units (a plus), the pricing is pretty much standard anywhere you go if not cheaper and the staff is great. Thanks amber for your help!<//Review>

I think the prices are great, the location is convenient for me and the Manager is friendly and professional. Every time I'm on the property I can expect her to be at the window or the door waving at me and asking me how my day is going. Big E is highly recommended by me.</Text>

<review>I went the other day looking for a storage locker and beings the fact that my run of luck has been horrible lately, I expected the worst. But it was everything but that. Amber greeted me as soon as I walked in the door and immediately made me feel welcomed. She showed me several different units to make sure that I was renting exactly the right one and for the price I can afford. She went above and beyond to make me feel like she cared about me and cared about what I've been going through. It was just a breath of fresh air after everything I've been dealing with lately. Thank you Amber<//review>< pictures>

The place is well kept and they have multiple size units for whatever you might need. 24hr security, alarmed units and I even bought some moving boxes. I recommend Big e for your storage needs.😀💗 Ask for Amber!</Review>

We searched on-line for a couple of weeks for a storage unit to replace one that we currently have. Found Big E had a unit available so we reserved it and went in two days later. The unit was still waiting for us and had not been given away despite us not putting down any credit card information. Anthony was quite helpful in showing us our unit, the terms of our contract etc. He answered all of our questions and was quite helpful. We especially liked the idea of being able to drive up to our unit any time between 7 am - 7 pm daily. That wasn't an option at the facility that we are leaving. We're glad that we found Big E. Check them out. You won't be disappointed.< /Review>

I love this storage facility. It is clean and I liked Ashley BUT it is really overly priced compared to other facilities. I called several recently so I will prob end up moving because of that so just something to think about if you are concerned about montly fee.<//text>

I got lost trying to find the place because I'm from San Jose. But it was worth the drive. Amber helped me and was great. She got me into a unit twice the size i had in San Jose for less money. The units looked brand new and Amber was a very friendly gal.<//review>

The guy who helped me was so nice, inviting and very professional.  The employee went over the entire contract with me to make sure I understood everything. Prior to this I had rented at Public Storage and I could never get them to return my call in a timely manner and they were very rude.  Also public storages facility was not very clean.  Big E is clean and very well taken care of.  The employee even helped me put a cover on the window because I could not get it to roll up properly until my husband could get off of work and get a cover for the car two days later.   This is a 100 percent customer service type of place.  Please give this place a call first before you rent a space anywhere else.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Im upset because i have pay for a whole month if i decided to empty the storage after my due date. Big E staff just told me they dont prorate. I had a storage with them for almost 2 years. Wow! You cant prorate me for 7 days after my due date?? This is the only reason why im giving them 3 stars.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>
