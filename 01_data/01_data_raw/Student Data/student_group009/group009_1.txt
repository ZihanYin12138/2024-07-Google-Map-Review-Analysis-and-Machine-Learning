I absolutely love the job they did on my window tint. Very professional and the lady at the front desk was very helpful and informative about the product. Great pricing. Quality work was done in a timely manner, and again, like I said before I LOVE the way my windows turned out. Will definitely recommend family and friends to this shop.< /Text>

Great window tint job and front desk was very knowledgeable about their products.  The only reason I didn't give the 5th star is I had to call to see if my car was ready since I didn't receive a call after my car had been there for 4 hours even though it was ready AND because I would suggest cleaning up the streaks from the soapy water they use so cars aren't sitting in the sun with water streaks. Other than that, they have great specials. I might take one of my other vehicles soon.</Review>

<review>I posted 2 stars about a month ago.Wonderful job on the tint but personal service was lacking.Maybe it was an "off"day but it wasn't too welcoming...Today I put 5 stars up.Still a wonderful tint job. As their name says,quality work and quality product used.Better day,maybe. Helpful,organized and informative.Job well done!</review>< name>

I recommend calling and making an appointment. They did a fantastic job tinting my windows. Got 20% 3m window tint and they offer great prices. Robert is a perfectionist when it came to making sure the tint looked crisp! Also got xpel paint protection on hood/front bumper. Finally got protected against those paint chips that my car seemed to attract. Great job with both!</Text>

<text>The customer service here is incredible. I randomly tried this place based off of reviews. They not only repacked my window from a break in, but matched my tint, and cleaned up the glass. The price was nothing compared to what I was about to pay elsewhere. I would recommend.<//text>< pics>

But they did leave my car a MESS! My rosaries & air fresheners were left thrown on the ground, there were rags left behind in my car, and my seat covers had been stained with a dark color when my car was returned to me. Felt a little on the unprofessional side to have returned my car in that condition but overall the actual tint job was nice.</Review>< user_name>

The paint protection involved a lot of complex curves for the entire front of the car, but the work was perfect.  There are no visible edges despite the many pieces applied. (They rolled the edges around the hood and fenders, for example.)  They also protected additional surfaces for no extra charge.
They're a small town family business...but don't underestimate them.  The professional work is as good as any high-end tint shop I've used.</review></record></dataset><record>

These guys are always in point. I've done 5 vehicles here and I've never been dissapointed. There prices are great, quality is A+ and there fast.  Always been able to pick my cars up within a few hours even when there busy. Highly recommend them to anyone in and out of town.  Thanks again to the crew, Eric from Big Foot Carpets down the road.</Review>

Highly recommend this place! Best customer service I've had in a while. Staff are friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and funny. I got my windows tint this morning and all my friends and family have been asking me who did my tint. I have received so many compliments about my tint and its only been a day. Overall, I'm a happy customer and I will definitely be returning.</Review>

Very nice experience. They agreed to match a price I got from a more local shop. They were friendly and didn't push the upgraded products that I ended up buying. They let me know what was available and then let me choose. Their waiting room was comfortable and had refreshments available while I waited.  I live 20 miles from this shop and it was worth the drive. Thanks everyone!<//Text>

As a repeat customer(3rd vehicle), I'm very dissatisfied with the quality and honesty of service from Quality Auto Glass Tint in Salida, CA. I paid this business $425.00 to remove black tint and install 3M Black Limo tint on the back half of my 2000 Dodge Ram Van B3500. I specifically expressed to the owner, Robert, that I wanted to ensure the tint was limo dark-so dark that no one could see through any of the back windows.
Robert ensure me the windows would be tinted as I requested. I dropped off the vehicle on a Tuesday and it wasn't ready for pickup until 2 days later on Thursday. Before the vehicle was ready, Robert informed me that he could not fully tint the 2 back windows-so a portion of the windows would be without tint. I asked him to discount the price. He agreed to give my a $26.76 discount. Despite this, he assured me the rest of the tint would be limo dark as I requested. Sad and disappointed to say the tint looks no darker than the previous tint. I can see completely through the vehicle, even in the shade. Also, the windows are not fully covered with tint around the border of the window vent hinges(totally unexpected). As a result of this poor, quality service, I'm out of $425.00 and my vehicle tint is worst. This was a complete waste of time and money! The owner can easily resolve this matter by contacting me ASAP and offering to pay half of the fee for me to have my windows properly re-tinted by another local window tint business.

Update: 10/16/19
One of the owner's Robert reached out to me in an effort to rectify the situation. He offered me half of my money back and I gladly accepted. Although, I had to pay another business to re-tint my vehicle, I  appreciate his efforts so I updated this review.</text>

Got 3m with warranty but it ended up with bubbles. Will need to go back and have it redone. When it is redone i will change the review. Staff is great though and they were timely in service. The surrounding area looks suspicious but no worries. It is easy to miss though so keep your eyes open and just pull in to the area. It took me a couple u-turns to find it but worth it.< /review>

Best in the valley!! I had several of my cars tinted here! The name says its all, great quality 3M tint and computerized technology is used to perfectly cut your tint to fit your car. So many different shades are available to customize it to your needs. The management and employees have over 15 years of experience. You'll find them to be very professional and honest. I highly recommend this place, look no further! They will guarantee that you will be satisfied.< /review>

They took the time to educate me on the benefits of having lifetime quality tint and gave me multiple brands/options to pick from. The lobby area was nice and cool, the tint brands and different shades were all displayed, and the receptionist was very kind and welcoming.  The owner Robert personally took the time away from the work floor and came in to the lobby area to help answer all of my questions. The most impressive part of this experience was the fact that they called me 20 minutes prior to the promised completion time and notified me that my car is ready for me to pick up. Even though they were busy working on vehicles a lot nicer than mine, they made me feel that my 2013 Altima was the most important thing on their agenda. The work was flawless and I look forward to doing business with them for years to come.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><rating>5< /rating>< date>

I was searching the web for a place to get my windows tinted and Quality Auto Glass Window Tint caught my eye because they had awesome reviews. And the reviews we’re right! Great customer service, great product, great workmanship, and to top it off a great price! They have a waiting room for you to Netflix and chill and enjoy some beverages while your waiting. They were able to do a full window tint on my crew cab Silverado in about an hour. They even lock your powered windows and put a sticker over the controls to remind you not to roll your windows down for about 3-5 days. I thought that was pretty cool. I’ll definitely be coming back to get the front end of my truck clear coated to protect the paint from chipping. I highly recommend Quality Auto Glass Window Tint!<//text>

<text>Fast, reasonably priced, quality work! Both my power window motors were going out & I had the worst DIY window tint. They replaced both motors, removed the existing garbage tint, and put high quality 3M tint all in about 2 hours and for a better priced than expected. Additionally they were able the remove water spots from the glass I'd been trying for years to get out. I'd highly recommend this business.< /text><UserId.>117227467080102370209</UserId.>< Pictures>

< review>
I recently took in my 2015 Dodge Charger for a window tint job at Quality Auto Glass Window Tint after doing my research online on Brands and local shops. I was kindly greeted by the office manager as I walked in and he briefly went over the different brand options and different shades they carry along with pricing. I ended up going with their 3M Color Stable film because of its Carbon true black appearance and its Superior Heat and UV Rejection compared to the other brands. I immediately trusted them with their Lifetime warranty, overlooking that they were certified and authorized with 3M. The car looks great after finished and it only took them 1 hour total! All in all,I had a great experience at Quality Auto Glass Window Tint and can definitely recommend them for their Quality in workmanship and honesty. I will be back for my paint protection "Clear Bra" installation on my next appointment.</review>

I had an appointment set on a Saturday morning and they were waiting for me to come in. They were so nice from the minute I walked in to the minute I picked up my car. Rhonda at the front desk made sure I understood what tint I was getting and difference in quality. I would highly recommend them.< /Review>

I chose this place because it had more good reviews than any other place in the area, and I was not disappointed. I don't know much about glass, so I approved a non-mazda glass to be used, but wasn't happy with it. The company ordered a mazda glass and replaced the other but did not charge me extra work hours, taxes, or any other "extra" fees. I really appreciated their professionalism paired with good work ethic and kindness. I never felt like I was being taken advantage of. If you are looking for a place to get your glass replaced or tinted - I suggest you try this place first.< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>This place is by far the best place ever! I got my quarter size windows tinted in the back because a few weeks ago I went to San Francisco and someone broke both windows...i looked at a few other places online but Quality Auto Glass window tint was the only place that had five stars and the best reviews. After I had my windows replace I had to get them tinted again these guys were awesome they not only matched the tint to the same tint I had on my there windows but the price was good paid $45 for both windows and the customer service there is amazing they have a waiting room for you with a coach and t.v where you can watch movies while you wait for your car to be done. The a/c kicks ass and they have a little refrigerator and you can help your self to a bottled water or can soda! I live in tracy but driving to them was well worth it I will definitely be taking my other cars here. I just wanted to say thank you to the female receptionist I didn't catch your name great over the phone and you were great in person keep up the good customer service I will definitely be coming back to you guys  from your customers Diana and Mary Ann with the 2007 gray Toyota Camry Hybrid</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<text>just finished up getting my 2014 Toyota Prius window tinting done at quality glass tint and alarms. the job turned out perfect and I am very satisfied with the customer service, very informative about the different films they carry. They are 3M authorized and the 3M color stable window tint they applied is very helpful with blocking out the heat and looks very stylish. I can highly recommend them and will bring back every car I own.</text>< pictures>

Great and fast! I appreciate the work and quality of my car tint. They aren't pushy with up-sales. If you do chose them for your tint or glass jobs bring someone else to bring and drop you off. I will say their waiting room consisted of a couple couches and a tv with Netflix that didn't work. Overall I got a great deal especially considering the great job.< /Text>

<text>I sure wish I'd found them five years ago.  I've had MANY tints between Stockton, Salida and San Jose.  Five years ago I had my new vehicle windows tinted here in Tracy.  When I picked it up I thought something was wrong.  The back window was completely blurred.  Over time all the tint purpled, bubbled and tore.  Today Quality Auto Glass Tint retinted my windows.  Incredibly professional, spectacular work, great timing (also replaced my windshield) very competitive pricing, lifetime warranty and for the first time in FIVE YEARS I could see out my back window with NO BLURRING.  Couldn't be happier.  Thank you!!!!!</text>< name>

<date>1621914334091<//date><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Mom and pop pet food and supply store that carries some food and other item brands not carried by your big corporation pet store.  Parking is easy.  Owners and staff are nice. I go here for my dogs pet-food. Selection of variety isn't as big as a big corporate pet store but that is to be expected. I know exactly what I am going to get for my dog when I go here. Prices aren't bad--not going to be the cheapest..say for pet toys and stuff like that but they have the essentials and I like support info small businesses so I shop here when I can and go to the big P stores for the rest.< /Text>< Pictures>

Today there was a different person working there,  I asked for his name and he said"Im not going to tell you". Well service was not good to tell the truth he actually told me; that I can't buy there if I don't wear a mask. This is how Tyranny starts. (Remember WW2, ) We are losing our rights given to us by our CREATOR, ...I'm a Disable Veteran and can't wear a mask....CDC states anyone whom has a disability doesn't need to wear a mask.. I will report this to the state and city.  My Constitutional rights were VIOLATED!!!!<//review>

Wide selection of high quality pet food. You definitely won't see Purina or Beneful here (which is a good thing). Friendly and helpful staff as well.< /Text>

<review>I have been buying my tires here for over 10 years. This is a great personal owned business with a great owner. I highly recommend using mendez tire. He has quite a few tire sizes in stock at fair prices and he can order in just about anything you want.<//review>< Pictures>

Great Park for get-togethers or parties! It has a lot of grass that is perfect for soccer or ball games. There's two tennis courts, boccie ball, and a play structure for the young ones. There is a nice picnic area too.< /review>

Took my grandson's there to practice baseball. I noticed the city reworked the playground! Great Job! I lived 3 blocks away for 30 years and the park looks as good as ever!</text>

We all loved the Chichibu park because it had more stairs and difficult ones and the go-around and the organ to make music, we all had fun there even though we are adults with 2 little nieces 5 and 9.<//text>

Great park! I have been goin here since I was a little kid. Still great to visit. Has bocce courts, tennis courts, a play ground for kids and tons of grass space. There's mutiple.benches and grills for your. Convenience.. definitely worth taking the kids to!( As long as it's not 100° outside)<//text>

A very nice smaller neighborhood park in an older area with mature trees and blue collar working class families and households. Tennis courts and playground is popular, could definitely use some updates but all in all is a decent park to bring pets and kids to.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) It is a very nice parke but the man who sends the city is a pig pigs I have come barias veses and is always a pig in the bathroom do not clean it, it smells like this is all grafitiado, I do not let my children into that bathroom It's disgusting I think the city sends the caretaker to the park to be cleaned but stop it no longer opens it and at night it closes and it's all ay I wanted to upload photos of the bathrooms but it does not let me think that only the photos of the nice place they go up but the complaints do not

Es un parke muy bonito pero el señor que mandan los de la ciudad es un pinche puerco he venido barias veses y siempre es un puerquero el baño no lo limpian , huele a miados esta todo grafitiado  , yo no dejo que entren mis hijos a ese baño es asqueroso yo pienso que la ciudad manda al que cuida el parque a que los limpien pero parese que no mas lo abre y en la noche lo cierra y es todo a y quise subir fotos de los baños pero no me deja parese que solo las fotos del lugar bonitas se suben pero las de las quejas no</Text>

<Review>I live in Tennessee. My daughter and her husband are Marines stationed in California. I had accidentally used their old address to send their Christmas packages to and was worried they were lost. I tracked the packages here to this location, called to find them, and was reassured they were there and waiting to be picked up. Max was so helpful and kind. He remembered that my daughter and her husband had received packages from this box and was saving them for them. I was so relieved. I recommend this location as extremely helpful.< /Review></record>

<Text>I am not a fan of this location. I like to live by the Golden Rule that if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all but I have to say it here in hopes that whoever runs this locations reads it. Please have some decency and treat your customers better. First off, there is an older gentlemen that works here that makes me feel very uncomfortable every time I come in. I actually do everything I can to avoid this location but it is the only location that accepts Amazon barcode scans. He looks at me like a piece of meat and makes me feel so uncomfortable. It is horrible and very inappropriate. And I absolutely hate it! Please, have some respect for others and yourself. Secondly, I have dropped off packages here that never get scanned into the system. I have called and they basically tell me well, I am too lazy to look over my shoulder to see if your package is behind me so you are S.O.L. BUT I can give you the main line number so YOU can wait on hold for the next 300 years until you are disconnected. But once again, no I will not take the 3 seconds of my time to assist you with the very important packages you trusted me to handle. Even though that is my job. So long story short, I do not recommend this location but unfortunately it is the only spot that accepts Amazon scans. Anyone know of any other options for Amazon returns in San Clemente?</Text><Date>1601503437454<//Date>< resp>

PleAse don’t go to this store...
I don’t wanna talk about the boy at the desk and about the owner...I wanna just tell you that at the store ups close to Talega nr 4465 they will charge you 12 cents to print a file from a email (one dollar for the email)...in this one here these people are charging you one dollar for every single page...88 cents of difference...always under the famous name of Ups around the world...
The answer of the owner was: different stores different rules...
Omg...horrible customer satisfaction...
Horrible service...
Can I give zero stars ?!!!!!!!</text>

<review>This team is unhelpful and will tell you rules that are lies. If you ever drop off multiple Amazon packages, and they insist that they need to be in one box--that is a lie. Unfortunately for them, that's not in the Amazon instructions. You can just leave the packages at UPS and contact Amazon. Amazon issues refund.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

New older guy who has been there for three weeks apparently, said it was gonna be “hard” to fax three documents. His coworker then told him that it was time to learn how to fax something. I realized that I had given him the wrong fax number accidentally and once I told him he gave me a death stare like it was some huge inconvenience to do his job. I left and took my business to FedEx. Some people... won’t be giving this UPS any of my business in the future.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dcf4725e8e1901:0xe226696c7fc3c7bf</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I've never given a business a 1 star review.  This is a first.The owner was rude. You get the feeling they have plenty of business and could care less about losing a customer.<//Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>Made the 30 minute drive to this location because their posted hours say they are open until 7. Arrived at 6:45 and they were already locked up. The guy was sitting inside working on the computer. I knocked on the window, he looked up at me holding a large oackage, then right back at his computer. Wouldn't acknowledge me or even come over and offer an explanation why they were closed early. The sign in the window confirmed they were supposed to be open until 7pm. Incredibly unprofessional. Looking at the other reviews it appears this man has some serious issues.< /text>< pics>

<text>Have been here several times.  The employees that work there seem to hate there jobs and customers.  No hello or thanks or anything no expression at all.  Especially the old Asian guy.  I go the extra couple miles up the street to that UPS store.  Way better. They don’t want your business don’t go to this store.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dcf4725e8e1901:0xe226696c7fc3c7bf< /Gmap_id>< Date>

I am using this as my mailbox for a 3 month period I am living in the area. They are a bit understaffed at times leaving too much to handle but they really do try to manage it all. Coming in daily I've gotten to know the staff and they've been incredibly helpful to me. Keep in mind they can't do everything, like send via usps flat rate and they can't turn back clocks to make cutoff times for overnight, but they do try their best to give customers the best rate. Sometimes it's not them and they will be honest and tell you. I definitely recommend this store. (Note I edited this review after posting a grouchy one because the hours on here were wrong and wasted a trip for me. Guess what? Users can fix things like that. So I fixed the hours. Problem solved.<//Review>

This store is right across the street from my house, and I drive 2 miles elsewhere just to avoid the customer service in this place. They really are not into the customer at all.
The post office does a better job.< /review>

Several times charged me for a more expensive service like 2 day and shipped ground. Or charged me $14.50 for a USPS flat rate envelope that cost them $6.45. Their prices seem arbitrary and guessed as long as they are over charging you.< /review>

They use the excuse that their staffer is in training as to why a package didn't go out on that day - so my employee's paychecks were late.  Horrible customer service - no apology for their lack of communication - DO GO TO THIS UPS STORE!< /Text>

<Date>1618341955469<//Date><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I Got accepted for a rental property and was asked to put down a deposit without even seeing the property. I asked to see the property first and arrangements were made. I brought my girlfriend along and we viewed the property. The next day I followed up and they were concerned that my girlfriend did not submit an application. She had no plans to move in but she submitted an app anyway. The following week I received an email saying I was declined. I responded that I had already been approved and that I didn't see any reason that should change. They responded that the denial was based on my co-applicants credit. I explained that she has better credit than I do, as our documents show. Did not hear back. The only explanation I can think of is that my girlfriend is a latin immigrant, and the homeowner-who we met and who screens the applications _did not like this fact. Upset but glad I didn't sign the lease< /Review>< pics>

I am a property owner and tried to handle renting myself, after a few weeks of trying to find tenants, I knew I needed help. I was referred to Cornette from my Realtor Ronnie Sylvia, and they have been amazing. Elena started with a phone call where she broke down their pricing but also just gave me advice if I wanted to keep trying on my own. After giving up, they came in and took over, Elena and her team were flexible with my needs, extremely communicative and their professional expertise has been invaluable. I know have tenants at a higher monthly rate than I was asking for myself. If you are considering switching to a property manager definitely use Cornette and ask for Elena!</Text>

<review>We have been using Cornette PM for over 2 years now for managing our property. We switched over from another company after I researched 2 other companies together with Cornette. Someone in my neighborhood also  recommended them.

We needed a company that would look after our property with our (owner) interests at heart. We found that with Cornette.  They have also done really well in answering my questions before they started managing our property and even now are always very responsive.   All in all they provide good value for money too.</review><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

Ericka has always been so helpful and informational whenever I had issues.

I moved out of my most recent rental house in March and there were some issues in regards to the deposit and some damages within the unit. I emailed Cornette and spoke with Monica, who was very friendly. I shared with her my concerns and she was able to speak with the owner of the property and we were able to come to an agreement on charges.

Ericka, Monica, and the rest of the staff are great and I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking to rent in the Sacramento area.< /Text>< Pictures>

If stress and heartache aren't on your to-do list when you're looking for your future home then I would stay as far away from this property management company as you can.
This is true for both renters and property owners. Do yourself a favor and choose ANY OTHER company to look after your property or help you find your next living space.< /Text>

I am beyond disgusted with my experience with this company. It has wasted about a month trying to get approved. One thing after the other. I constantly had to call/ harrass to see if they were doing anything about processing my application. 3 almost 4 weeks have gone by and now there is an issue with my income. I absolutely make enough money at my hair salon to cover 3+ times the rent even on a bad week but they will not accept commission based salaries, bonuses, miscellaneous pay, tips, retail commissions, or any other type of pay that is not by the hour because it is not guaranteed income. What kind of logic is that. Hours are not guaranteed now a days either. I feel like she could have told me this in the beginning. Save yourself a headache and look elsewhere.  I really feel bad for the homeowners that are paying them to rent their homes. I could have paid a years worth of rent up front.</text>

This management company is awful. Me and my husband applied to 1 house. On their website they have a link you can go to, to see if there are any pending applications. On the one we were applying to there were not any pending applicants. So we applied and paid the fee. They also ask a question on your application if there are any other properties your interested in. There were so we listed them incase our application didn't go through on the first. Btw the other 2 houses we put on our applications also didn't have any pending applications.

They email me back and say the property we applied for had been rented, our second preference didn't allow pets, and our third preferencethey were waiting on a deposit. Confused and irritated because they had misinformation on their website I emailed them. I asked for a refund and told them they needed to update their website.

I got an email back saying they take in 10 applications per listing and let the owner choose (they dont say that on their webaite though) and they won't refund us. The application fees are 40 dollars. They basically rob you of your money. 120 dollars they robbed me and my family during a pandemic.... This management company is a joke. I'd give it no stars if I could. Awful and greedy people.</Text>

< Review>
I recently went through the processes of renting a house. We applied for a house through Cornette Property Management, $40 per application.  They requested information that was not pertinent (6 months of mortgage statements for a house we did not own!) I informed them of this and they closed our application and refused to give us a refund! Across the board property companies have refunded our fee when they didn't complete the application, however Cornette has refused this courtesy and they were the ones that canceled our application! I believe this is unfair given the circumstances. Amid the pandemic $80 is a lot of money.
Do not use Cornette they are unfair!< /Review>

TLDR; Don't waste your time and money on this company.

On 10/6/20 I came across a listing for a studio apartment which would not be available until 11/20/20. By 10/11/20 I had not heard back from Cornette Property Management. There weren't any pictures of the interior but since I knew a previous resident, I was confident I wanted to live at this property and applied through the website. On 10/15/20 I heard back from a "Credit Manager", Sarah, who informed me I'd need a co-signer since I had previously rented from a family member (they just saw the same last name, didn't know who the family member or what the situation was) and had only been at my current job for 4 months. I have been through the probationary period in my role and have even been promoted. They did not ask about the details of this nor about my previous job history. If they had, they'd have learned that I had worked in property management for a National company and am very familiar with the policies and procedures in regards to Fair Housing. When I responded offering more rental references and offered an explanation in employment, it took "Credit Manager", Kaitlyn, four days to let me know my application had gone inactive despite the fact that I had responded to the last email immediately.

The lack of communication and ridiculous policies that are not fluent throughout the industry not only caused me to take a hit on my credit and throw away $40, but realize that the reviews (online and from previous residents at multiple properties I've spoken with) are true and that Cornette Property Management is not a company I will ever rent from or recommend. I'm honestly glad I found out now as opposed to after signing a contract.<//review>

Its been over two weeks since i engaged with this company.
During the difficult times, they have provided with the worst service possible. I have followed up with any request for perspective tenants on properties listed and decided to pay along and provide them with all that they asked in the process.
They are not big on communication and may let an email or attachment completely be skipped altogether.

They have charged me for the application fee and have stopped responding, the issue is i have good credit score, good rental history record, and an job that can easily substantiate the rent amount.

Now I’m left to wonder, wether i was racially profiled as there is no explanation nor answer from management, and i will pursue legally into this matter.

So thank you for nothing!!

As for my recommend, take your business elsewhere.< /Text>

Applied for a rental home and they quickly emailed to inform us we were missing documents and our current landlord didn't submit his reference. When I immediately got back to them explaining that everything was done, they ghosted us for days. I called and emailed them and it took days to get back to me.  In the meantime,  I noticed the rental was no longer available.  When they finally got back to me, I was never told they rented the home to someone else until I brought it up!  They dragged their feet with our application process so they could rent to another applicant but tell me it was the "owner" who went with another applicant. Karma is real.  Based on other reviews, the property management company always has an excuse or a "justification".</Text>

If I was aware you also had a business and were looking for a commercial property, I would not have notified you that the property you were trying to transfer your application over to was a commercial property.  It was not until after you put in the transfer request that you sent over documentation showing your business.

This was a very interesting experience. Applying for an apartment and working with the applicable department for a few weeks I have an understanding and message I would like to pass on. This company is very questionable! After non-professional emails and unprofessional reaction from staff members. I would really make sure this is an area you want to be leaving/rent in. Because of COVID-19 this area a little different I understand that. But rude and not professional seems to not be a good trade-off. after getting denied for an apartment that I was clearly qualified for I'm not going to get into the details. I moved my application over to an office For my company. before applying for the initial apartment all of my concerns and the fact that I wanted more than one property were brought up to. being the fact that my application went through so many people's hands and the conversation or notes did not go along with the application I feel like they were under the wrong consumption and I was asked if I'm going to live in the office building with my children and I felt like that was very disrespectful and it would not have happened if I was not African American. I will say in the end I did get approved for the also receive a phone call from management trying to smooth things over. I feel like the only reason I did get approved is because of the scrutiny that was put on the situation. Also, my credentials were legit and it's no way that they could deny me. So I would say make sure you come completely correct documents checks stubs anything you need to proceed to the next level with this company because they have no personality and it's all documentation. Also, I did receive cards for food. I felt like that was a really nice finishing touch and I do appreciate that.<//text>

<review>Very disappointed in Cornette Property Management as a business. I applied to rent a house for me and my husband. Both my husband and I were required to submit separate applications.  I submitted my application with the application fee of $40 and within 3 hours, was told the application was rejected because another tenant's application was chosen. My husband had not had the chance to submit his apart of the application before I was told this.  When I requested a refund (because our applications could not have been considered before they were rejected as he had not completed his application yet) I was denied.

I advise the public not to submit applications where a fee is required. In this case, my application was clearly not considered even though I paid $40. Application scam.<//review><gmap_id>0x809ae6d321497795:0x4483e9b3b9fd83bb</gmap_id>< userid>

<Text>The Application fee is a Hustle.
How do you think they are still in business with so many unhappy customers 🤔

Go to Reality Round up before you waste any money with this company.

Discriminatory!!

Please please please, do not rent from these people!!!!!. We were vulnerable enough to say, "not all ratings mean they are bad" F that!!!! We had mold in our house and they never contacted us, then for the deposit they charged us for dumb stuff like a screen aerator. When we got the house it was destroyed and smelled like human pee!! Not only that, but when we cleaned the house there were shooter bottles everywhere!! There was a wasp nest in the back yard.When I'd call the office there was some rude lady who would answer the phone like it was her house and always had a bad attitude. I'd give them 0 stars but I can't. I'm just so glad to be out of there.<//Text>

{'time': 1598039499142, 'text': 'Hello Lyza,\n\nYou created a work order on 2/11/2020 “ we believe there is mold in the house”. The maintenance department attempted to get a hold of the tenants and ask if anyone has cleaned it with the 50% bleach and 50% water solution. No one reached back out to us. However, on 3/2/2020 you had your annual inspection. Our inspector reported mildew in a closet. We reached out via email with the same information as before. Your roommate then replied saying she has cleaned it and it has not  come back. We then closed the work order since she confirmed the situation was handled.\n\nRegarding your deposit, we do compare your move in inspection with your move out inspection. Anything that is reported on the move out that was not reported on the move in inspection does get charged back to you once the work is completed. Unfortunately there were a few items we had to charge back to you. You did dispute the charges, however after the owner reviewed your email with the inspections,  and stated charges to remain.\n\nLastly, as a new tenant we do give you the opportunity to add to your move in inspection. We typically give you 1-2 weeks to add. After reviewing your tenant documents, work orders, emails and text messages nothing was ever reported.\n\nMonica'}</Resp>

We rented a home and had an overall positive experience with Cornette. They were quick to respond to questions/requests, although sometimes we had to ask multiple times for repairs that weren’t urgent. Their payment site is easy to use and convenient. I thought our move out process would be a nightmare with the horror stories you hear about people being taken for their deposits, but Cornette was very organized, detailed, thorough in their inspection and I thought extremely fair in their deposit refund. I didn’t feel like they had “cheated me” in any way. We rented from them for almost 10 years and overall, a good experience. Thanks Cornette!</review>

My experience with Cornette has been one of dehumanization, unhelpfulness to the point of neglect, and of very blatant incompetence.
There were two instances where I called to ask about something that was stated on their website, the first time I called to ask about needing a photocopy of your social security card, and in that phone call asked if anything else hadn’t been updated and I was told that no everything else was up to date, I called back a second time because I didn’t have my cats shot records, I was then told I didn’t need them.
Their customer service is non-existent, and they do not listen when asked questions, instead, they merely regurgitate information at you rather than trying to understand your situation and attempt to help you. I and my two partners are trying to move from out of state and it has been on the whole very frustrating and stressful, Cornette did nothing to try and help mitigate the stressfulness of our situation instead they exacerbated it to a very high degree.
If you can and customer service is important to you I recommend dealing with someone else.
They were asked multiple times either through email or over the phone very specific questions and instead of
listening the just regurgitated information I already knew or sent back a copy-pasted email.
I and my family tried to be upfront as we could think to be and we were not shown the same courtesy.
If I could give it a negative star review I would. I can’t help but draw a parallel that they willfully took our money knowing that we wouldn’t qualify.<//text>

<text>The worst renting process/experience of my life.
I applied for 6 homes with denial for all of them and here are my qualifications:
1. 800+ credit score
2. Annual income over $150k
3. 0 evictions ever
4. 8-year consistent work history

There clearly is racism baked into the home decision process. My son, wife and myself were sad for days knowing this racist system still exist in California.
😥
. The owner of the business says " the homeowners simply chose someone else six times". Well that's exactly the racism I'm referring to. You have a process where someone who has exceptional credit, income, and background can get discriminated against simply due to race. They can simply search our name on the application and see what race we are.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>
{'time': 1582389033116, 'text': 'Hi Emmanuel,\n\nAs per our phone conversation. You were never denied with the company, the homeowners simply selected different applicants. Unfortunately the properties that you applied for were all in the same general area, price range and quite similar – When you wanted to transfer your application, many times we had other qualified applicants in the same situation as you and transferred over their applications as well.  I let you know that you could transfer over your application to any of our available properties, look on the website actively and let us know right away. We abide by all Fair Housing Laws.

<text>After applying for several houses through this company it seemed like we had a very difficult time, curious I checked the reviews and it seems like a lot of others have too. Would not recommend working with them and even bothering with the application fees. I’m sad I gave them my money. They didn’t even check my credit and said we didn’t apply for some odd reason about our credit even though they never checked it? Super disappointing when you’re a good person just trying to find a place to live :/< /text>< date>

We have had the ABSOLUTE WORST experience trying to rent a house through Cornette. Not only did they ask for an absurd and unnecessary amount of financial and personal information (including our first born child and blood type), they denied us on zero grounds which is arguably discrimination on their part. I don’t recommend this property management company for anything but a headache and an insane amount of frustration.<//text>

As a landlord my experience with Cornette has been excellent in many respects. I have had the displeasure of living through a gamut of issues with my properties and Cornette has always delivered in a professional and timely fashion to help solve those issues. A property management company's job is precisely to alleviate the stress of managing rentals and Cornette delivers in spades with experience and courtesy.

Maintenance issues are dealt with swiftly, with intelligence (and even good humor!) by Monica. She is able to narrow down the problem and call up on just the right amount of professional help to take care of multiple problems economically and in one trip. Monica's vendor selection I found to be excellent and they provide professional work at competitive rates so much so that I don't bother shopping around anymore.

April, the turnover specialist, helped me *completely* renovate a unit that was utterly trashed in just three weeks flat, ahead of schedule AND under budget with change to spare for a few nice upgrades... April even helped me solve some issues by quickly taking the initiative on some decisions with paint and flooring which made my life happy. Thank you!

Jessica was invaluable in navigating the always tricky decisions of rent increase, market pricing and regulation regarding rent increase caps. Jessica is also a great resource for some quick rental market analysis and comps. Emily who works with Jessica helped me track down a tenant who did not make full rent payments and while I dread receiving a late payment notice I am confident they are on top of things always.

Last but not least Elena who was actually my first contact at Cornette I credit with strongly influencing my decision to sign up with Cornette. She has always been very personable with me on the phone and has great insight into what tenants like to see. She takes care of touring properties and has a pulse on the market.

Quite frankly after reading all the angry reviews on here I was highly skeptical of Cornette when I first signed in. Elena helped alleviate some of those issues and then experience showed that sometimes the keyboard warriors are wrong. Oh and did I mention that Cornette management rates are simply unmatched in all of the Sacramento area? (I know I looked at about a dozen alternative!)

Thank you Monica, April, Jessica, Emily and Elena. You guys rock.< /text>

My friends just recently got a place through these people and what they got was not what they signed up for. The house is dirty. Everything important like the stove and washer and dryer are broken. Carpets weren't cleaned. The house smells like animals.nit also did not cone with a garage like my friends were expecting as well as this was on the posting of the property on the Cornette web site. They never got to look at the house prior to anything the property placr did to it.< /Text>

The entire process was smooth from the get go! After I filled the app out online I was sent a link in my  email. From there it was step by step... Very convenient! I am a busy guy and I loved how I could do the whole thing from my phone.
The staff were very friendly when I went in to sign the lease as well, which is quite refreshing. They did a great job making the move in process as easy as possible. All in all I am very happy with Cornette!<//Text>

<review>I was a renter with Cornette Property for a one-year lease. About 6 months into my lease my water heater went out. I immediately contacted the maintenance service advisor and was told she would contact the owners immediately. After a day with no returned calls I was forced to drive to their office to talk to the maintenance advisor because she was always “busy” every time I would call. I was told that the cost for a new water heater was over a certain set limit and needed the approval of both homeowners, that’s right, there are two people who own the place I was renting. It just so happens that on of the owners was out of town for a week on an extended camping trip. She then proceeded to tell me that having no hot water was not an emergency and would “work on it”. I ended up going a week with cold showers at 4am to go to work during the late winter months. After FINALLY getting the water heater replaced, I sought out compensation for the week without hot water and then the maintenance adviser conveniently TOOK VACATION! At about two months left on my lease I was given notice that they would be raising my rent as well. At the end of my time with the rental I turned in my keys about 20 days before my lease expired due to me moving out of town. I just received an extremely high SMUD bill and can only assume that they were in the house after my keys were turned in but before my lease was expired. Overall, I was extremely dissatisfied with my year lease with this company and would strongly urge people to look elsewhere.</review>< pictures>

{'time': 1564775632411, 'text': 'Dear Daniel,\nI am sorry to hear you had some frustrations with maintenance during your tenancy. After looking into the matter please see the below information.\n\nThe no hot water was reported to us 10/9/18 which was a little under 3 months after you moved in. This maintenance concern was reported to us at 10:05 am on 10/9/18. At that time our maintenance coordinator reached out to our vendor who was dispatched the same day. Our plumber reported that the water heater had to be replaced so the owner was contacted the same day. The replacement was over our approval amount which is why the owner was contacted. After business hours one of the owners approved the replacement, and not having hot water is in fact an emergency. The vendor was notified on 10/10/18 at 7:56 AM and installed a new one that day. Per the state of California not having hot water is an emergency and our maintenance department would not have told you it was not an emergency. I have gone back in your emails with the maintenance department and all documents we had on file for you and there was never a request for compensation. You gave notice that you would be vacating on 7/20/19 and then turned keys in on 7/10/19. Any usage from SMUD would have been your usage. If you do have any other concerns, I would be happy to discuss them with you. Our office number is 916-988-5357.'}< /response>

< Review>
Seriously perplexed, had great references, and a few blemishes on my credit but I had paid most everything, I was denied a duplex. I made 4 and half time the rent and my rental history is fantastic, no evictions no nothing. I called to ask why I was denied and was told I had to many collections, I informed her that most I had paid she states, it doesn't matter they were still reported as collections. I've never heard of paying collections being a bad thing. Something is off. I do notice that the credit manager does reply on these reviews and it appears she Violates a lot of peoples Confidentiality. You are not to put peoples personal information regarding there past living arrangements or there references on a public forum, frankly it is poor business ethics and as a Manager you should be fully aware of what type of legal issues that can create. Be careful.

I have reached out to an attorney to see if it is legal to violate HIPPA by posting personal information in your response to my review. Thank you!<//Review>

<text>I applied for one of their properties and made a little more than 3x the rent, but it took them 3 weeks to get back to me with any information and even then, they replied to my wife's application/email (as a secondary applicant, not to me as the primary) telling us we were denied. Neither one of us saw that they had performed the credit check for either of us, so they basically took our $80 app fee and did NOTHING! I would not work with this place again even if I was homeless and they were giving away free houses. Total SCAM!< /text>< pics>

<review>I know how financially difficult it has been for my self, a small business owner over the passed couple of months ( March 1st 2020 i paid on the 8 th ) then again in April ( April 1st payment paid on the 12 th ) . It made me feel very uncomfortable as the March 1st payment was drawing nearer and again with the April 1 st payment . All the points of contact that i have had with the team @  Cornette property management , may it be over the phone or in person were OUTSTANDING and very helpful / accommodating . If anyone @ Cornett property management ends up reading this then i would just like to say "THANK YOU " for your understanding all you have done for me .

We went to see the house and their agent did not show up. When we called them, they first put me on hold for 10 mins and then said our agent was there and you came late. I was there exactly at 1 PM and no one showed up. There was also one other lady waiting to see the house and no one showed up.< /text>

<Text>I have lived in a Cornette property for the past 5 years . Although rent increase is something totally out of our control, the property management is amazing. With accommodation repairs in an extremely timely manner, a wonderful knowledgeable staff and amazing sub contractors. Not that I have needed many repairs but what has been needed has been awesome! Nancy is top notch!!    Thank you for always taking care of me and my casa.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>They get no star from me.  Went in today to co-sign for a friend and was told that I need to own a property in order to co-sign.  I had no issue co-signing for others before, this company told me that it was in their policy and its on the website.  I said where is it on the website because I didn't see it and she said it's on there.  Never will I ever go back or recommend this property management to anyone.

I’m here to say that I am so upset to see these horrible reviews. I fell in love with a rental property and because of these reviews my partner will not apply to the house. If the property owner who owns the home on s Whitney blvd sees this. Please consider finding a different property manager who has good reviews.<//text>

<Name>Arctica Yang</Name><response>{'time': 1561488020860, 'text': 'Hello Arctica,\n\nWe have been in communication with you several times regarding the status of your application.  We do give out deadlines on applications when we have made several attempts per verification and are not receiving responses from landlords and employers. We typically reach out to each party 2 times prior to giving an applicant a deadline.  In this case when we had reached out to you and given your application a deadline, we were pending your co-applicant’s employer and your (Arctica) current and prior landlord verifications.  I sent you the update and deadline of the application on June 7th.  We had emailed your co-applicants employment verification 2 times, faxed out your current landlord verification form 2 times, and left 2 voicemails for your prior landlord.  You did respond letting me know that your prior landlord in fact did return our call and provided an email address to send the verification form to after the deadline was given. I sent out the verification and received that back that same day. At that time, I took the application off a deadline and reached out to your co-applicants’ employer one more time via email and called your current landlord and was directed to leave a voicemail to follow up on the fax that was originally sent out.  We still did not hear back from the employer or current landlord and reached out to you placing the application on a 2nd deadline on June 10th. After two days of not hearing from the employer, current landlord, or either applicant we placed the application inactive and notified you regarding the application being placed inactive on June 12th.  I did not hear anything from you or your co-applicant until June 19th asking who we had sent the verification forms too. I did respond letting you know again what verifications we were still pending. If you would like to call into the office, I will be more than happy to go over how your application was processed with you.\n\nSarah, Credit Manager'}<//response>< Pics>

<Text>I'm disappointed that the communicate with Sarah didn't go too well. I've provided all of the necessary documents requested including 6 months of bank statements, three months recent pay stubs and  my $70 fees and at the end my application was put on inactive. I wasn't informed of a deadline that must be meet for the application process. I have no knowledge of who was contacted in regards to verifying pass and current landlord. I've checked with my current landlord and she didn't  received any phone calls nor email. While waiting for my spouse  employment verification, I'm not sure who Sarah contacted with but wasn't able to provide the names of the person.  I checked with my spouse employer and no one receive any employment verification form. (Note that recent pay stubs were send in). While I was only given about an 24 hours notice to see if the landlord and employment verification gets send to Sarah, I did contact my landlords and employer but they didn't receive any paper. I did asked for Sarah to resend and contact the people the needs verification from. She stated that it was sent three times already. At the end, my application was put on inactive. I email Sarah to see who was the people that she's trying to get the verification from that it might be a error on my behalf...as of June 23,2019, no reply yet. It's been almost a month and I still have not found a home with Cornette. I feel like I've been a victim of a scam in a legit way to be its victim personal information then left to die. Hopefully Cornette reach out to me too... I'll update the review when they do.<//Text>< user>

I wish I would have read these reviews prior to applying! I applied for one of the units they have about 2.5 weeks ago. Thought the electronic pdf Offer Letter AND current pay stubs would be good enough employment verifications. I have responded to all the requests they asked for. Now they're asking for an offer letter on letterhead, mind you my Government job has an onboarding process electronically, and none of the Supervisors from ANY of the Government jobs I have worked will/can verify employment directly. So she says they have to deny my application because the pdf electronic Offer Letter isn't sufficient enough. Honestly I just want my $40 back and I'll pass on this one, because I doubt they've even started a credit check. I will be filing a fraud claim with my bank to have those funds returned!

I provided you a pdf copy of that letter last week and never nothing else was needed until I asked for a 5th status update. My supervisor still will not be able to provide you with a letter. Needless to say I applied to rent sometime around 1/14/2020, it should not take this long as well as I have not seen an alert that my credit report was pulled. Either way based on these reviews you have bad business practices for both tenants and landlords.< /Review>

My girlfriend and I had been trying like crazy to find a new place to live as we were exceptionally fed up with apartment living. After a few weeks of searching we were able to find a great place to rent at a very reasonable price. Working with Mrs. Rose has been amazing, as she has quickly answered any and every question we have had, as well as made it very clear what we needed to have our application approved so that we could move in. Thank you very much!<//review>

<Review>Nothing but love for Cornette ! Every encounter I’ve had with them has been smooth. From applying and getting approved, moving in and moving out. They are so helpful and informative throughout the entire process start to finish. I don’t know how many others can say the same about their property managers. I know my friends don’t have the best experiences. They even have an app for your phone to pay rent or see your payment history. Pretty snazzy ! I am now in my second rental managed by Cornette ! One day if I ever acquire my own real estate to rent out I would feel most comfortable with Cornette to take care of the home on my behalf. Thank you !!!!< /Review>< Pics>

The other companies I’ve encountered rush you out of the property and make you feel like you are in inconveniencing them.</text>

We have not yet rented with Cornette but while looking for a place for my mother, we weren't getting much help and felt overwhelmed by the experience of  looking for a rental home. I called Cornette and was surprised to not only get an actual live human on the line, but a polite helpful one, Sammy. She gave me some info and when we came in to fill out a rental application, she remembered me and was kind and helpful. Thank you Sammy!< /Text>

I tend to do a lot of these reviews about CPM because they really are the best Property Management company! They have never let me down. They are always super responsive to any questions or requests I have! To the lady who gave 1 star because her rent was raised, that’s called life! Of course rent is going to raise as minimum wage increases! Also, the owner of the properties raise the rent not cornette! Anyways, if you’re looking for a great PM company, Cornette is the way to go!!< /Text>

Most horrid customer service ever. Rude. Dismissive. Everyone we spoke to had a bad attitude and the amount of disrespect was nothing short of apalling. I don't understand how this company is still operational. I truly everyone in that office loses their job so they can't harrass anyone else.

Edit: you're response literally proves my point. Posting my personal information and situation publicly doesn't help you in the slightest. And for the record, we were approved instantaneously for a 3 bed 2 bath for higher than what you offered without a single late payment. (since we're posting personal info here) you guys are a joke. Instead of taking your one star reviews personally, do something about it. You guys are at 2.8 for a reason.< /Text>

{'time': 1553880055723, 'text': 'Hello Theresa,\n\nWe apologize you feel that way. By no means is that our intention and the way we want the company to be represented. I am not sure whom you are referring to as being rude and dismissive, but if you feel comfortable and know whom you spoke with, please pass the information on to us. As far as everything on our end when processing of your application we have several emails corresponding with you giving updates regarding your application.\n\nAt one point during the processing of your application our bank notified us that your application fee did not clear the bank. At that time, we stopped processing the application and notified all 4 applicants that the check did not clear and that we could only continue moving forward with processing the application if you paid the application fee in certified funds only. Bernard was pleasant and brought in the certified funds, I spoke with him directly in office letting him know we would continue the application process.\n\nOnce the application was completed and reviewed unfortunately the income did not meet our income requirements of three times the rental amount. We notified all applicants of the reason for denial yesterday, 03/28/2019.  We do offer for you to transfer your application to another property that you may qualify for with your income.  If you would like to contact the application department, we would be more than happy to discuss your concerns and your application with you.\n\nThank you,\n\nApplication Department'}<//Response>

Good luck trying to get your deposit back. Judy the owner is totally incompetent and will have nothing but excuses for everything. Good luck if you need any repairs done. In short you are better going anywhere else. Their 5 star reviews are put there by their employees. No accountability worst company bad owner stay away. But watch instead of saying were working to make the company better they will attact the post. Take heed of the warning.<//Review>< pics>

Bad customer experience. When applying, they ran a "Hard Inquiry" on my credit, left numerous calls unreturned, and took weeks to finalize the application. For a renter, my advice is to find another management company. Bottom dollar seems to be held in a higher regard than tenants.< /Review>

So far my experience has been awesome. With the rental market moving so fast it’s easy to get discouraged, especially when you are a first time renter. Elaina helped me by explaining that I could get a co-signer to help with my lack of rental history. I’m definitely going to a couple of the showings on Saturday and then most likely apply.<//Text>

I wish I read the reviews before I applied. I just wasted my money.  :(

Yeah no i just didn't like how impersonal and dismissive the application process was. You denied us right away with no real explanation or a chance to explain ourselves.  We made all the qualifications and had the deposit ready to move in and were excited but You threw our hopes and dreams out the window. My coapplicants were always on time with rent and are good tenants. You trust the word of one landlord without giving them a chance to dispute it. He just doesnt want them to move out so he made it so they couldn't. If you were a good company you would give people a chance instead of taking applications money and not working with an applicant who is clearly eager to rent.< /review>

<text>Cornette has managed a property for us for more than 8 years.  They are professional, organized and always follow the regulations regarding leasing, tenant and landlord responsibilities.  We recently had a tenant turnover and April was an incredible help in making decisions, budgeting and organizing work that was needed on the home.  We are hands on from afar about these details and April and Nancy were always patient with our frequent inquiries about the bids and approach to the work that was being done. They are strict on tenant move-out responsibilities re: cleaning and condition of the property. I would recommend that tenants read leases very carefully about cleaning responsibilities and notify re: anything that they find amiss with the property when they move in . And, take advantage of Cornette's option for tenants to be present at the move out inspection to ensure they have the opportunity to discuss any issues.  As landlords we have sometimes approved Cornette to waive some move out charges if we feel on balance we've had a good tenant, but not every owner will do the same.<//text>< Pictures>

Before we rented from Cornette I read all the review and was really worried. After driving by the house a few times and discussing it with my husband we decided to go for it as we really liked the house and it had everything we were looking for. Again we were both worried about all the negative reviews. We have been in this house for almost a year and have not had one issue with Cornette. We have had a few repairs that needed attention and they have been fixed in a timely manner. There has been one problem that has not been fixed but they have been in contact with me regarding this. Our pool skimmer broke a wheel over a weekend and it had to be replaced. We went and purchased the part, I took the receipt in the next day and they called me the next day saying my check was ready to pick up or they could mail it. We are hoping to renew our lease again. So far we are really happy with Cornette!!</Text>

<Text>By far the worst experience I’ve ever had dealing with any so called “business”.  The website clearly states that after applying you’ll have a decision in 1-2 business days (I understand it may take longer), yet I applied Aug. 9th and just found out Sept 3rd that the landlord decided to go with a different applicant. The entire time I had to follow up with them (Should be the other way around) which was extremely difficult considering it is impossible to get ahold of anyone in the application dept as it would go directly to voicemail every time, (although if you call the main number directly the reception will get the person working in applications on the phone)... interesting. Communication is key in any business especially when you’re dealing with someone’s home, and they failed me horribly. I would highly discourage anyone from doing business with them and if they were currently managing my property I would be highly concerned as to the money they were costing me by their ineptness.

Their response below is exactly what the problem is. It never occurred to them to let me know that the owners are out of the country and a response will be delayed. This courtesy would’ve went a long way when I’m moving from another city and needed a place to live ASAP.< /Text>< pictures>

On June 12th our system is showing 12 different email communications between you and the application department regarding the denial on credit.\n\nThank you for your time,\nSarah – Application department'}< /response><time>1564008004395<//time><Review>First time i applied they never even contacted me by phone or email to let me know if i was approved or denied still ran my credit, second time everyone in our household had decent credit standing but one, made 6xs the amount they required monthly plus had a good chunk in savings and still managed to deny us. They take application fees and profit off of them. Would never do business here. I am thankful for my current landlords now as they are much more professional.

Edit: I am absolutely appalled by the response i received. How about privately messaging me to discuss personal matters but since we are. I contacted Cornette property management before applying and explained that our credit was sub par they made me feel reassured that despite that they could make it work if all other criteria was met (rental history, clean background, etc which we have) and that they could increase deposit. We as a whole make $14,000 monthly, and have $25,000 in savings. My roommate had a medical emergency, that is why his credit was the lowest but my credit wouldnt be the best if i had an explosive device go off on me either (which was also explained) . The lack of response with a denial/approval was from 2014 when i first applied with this company, i figured i was one of the very few that got swept under the rug, which i understand happens, so i figured I'd give them a second chance because no business is perfect they still ran my credit but i didnt receive a denial letter or a call (for 2014). Which is required by state law. I am personally happy i did not get approved because if i did meet the hard criteria here i would just buy my own home instead.

Also i see a frequent theme with the negative reviews, a lack of communication. I have to compliment the skills on the response time to negative reviews but maybe instead going further put more energy upfront into response time and making people feel good, even if they did get denied. I understand by no means is it your fault if someone gets denied on lack of something but even a simple, I am really sorry that i could not help you, i understand that it is a very stressful time for you, but please consider us again in the future if you have a chance to build your credit, get a negative mark taken care of, increase your income, etc. Instead try being interpersonal while we are clients we are human beings as well. It makes it unfortunate when i see people getting embarassed by you disclosing their personal information for the world to see, people fall on hard times and while i understand negative responses effect your business practices if you changed from within your responses even in negative times would differ completely. You have to understand that some of these people whom are applying are about to be homeless if your applications are not done in a timely matter. If someone is denied i highly reccomend partnering with local property managements to use as referals to better assist your clients in finding a home, if they get denied wouldnt it be easier to get a cut of $50 per client referred or something along those lines that way you are not leaving your clients high and dry and you still get to share in the profit, while i understand the need of running a business the nicer and more helpful you are to even the worst of clients will show the world your character. But as it stands with all of these reviews you disclosing bounced checks almost like a highschooler on twitter i cannot take this company seriously.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Cornette always seems to have a wide variety of properties. The receptionist Elena was very helpful in answering all my questions about the showing calendar. I'm looking to move in a month or two and thought I'd get a head start. I'll definitely be filling out an application.</text>

This company raise the rent to ridiculous amount. When you have to speak to them they are sarcastic and rude. They can't even keep there books straight. When you need something fixed it get half fixed. Renting from this management company is a nightmare they only care about money and not the tenants. The owners of these properties need to read there reviews.</Text>

< Review>
They are generally rude, want to always argue, deny that you have called when you leave messages. Do not return calls timely if at all.
Have no consideration of others when they consider how to get things done. Repairs are not timely.
Their priority is collecting money, all else takes a back seat to this.< /Review>

We have actually had a pretty decent experience with Cornette.  At the beginning I will admit it was a little shaky.  The duration of our stay however (2 years) was uneventful.  Everytime we had a maintenance issue and had to call Nancy she took care of it immediately.  Unfortunately, the owner of the house died and the beneficiary of his trust is selling the house.  Otherwise we would have stayed long term.  We gave our 30 days notice and confirmed with the office that it was received.  We have not moved out yet and have not had to deal with getting our deposit back.  I hope the rest of the process goes as smoothly as the last 2 years.  I will update the post if it goes south.</text>

<text>You have read before, "If I could leave a no stars, I would" this time I would leave a negative star. I can not even express the disgust I have toward this company. Crooks and shysters, if you think you can get your security deposit back from these people, think again. Liars from day one, they promised to clean the carpet and paint the walls before we moved in, non of that was done. When we moved out we paid out of pocket to get the carpet cleaned and walls repainted and house cleaned. This company is truly deserves to get audited and license revoked.</text>< time>

So far so good. I was originally told that the duplex i wanted had a pending application and that i should call in a few days to find out if it was rented. I did and the duplex was still available.I was call within 15 minutes of leaving a message requesting to view the property. I was told there would be a viewing the next day. Everything went as planned. I sent in my application via e-mail and mailed out the check for the application fee the next day. I called to confirm that it was received by the right person and i actually got a call back and an e-mail confirming my check and applications where received. So far so good. I sent an e-mail with a couple of questions today and am hoping to hear back. i really hope my experience with Cornette is different that what you kind people have described.<//text>

On January 16, 2015 my home that I was renting from Cornette Properties caught fire. Nancy with Cornette was on the scene to help us. Nancy was wonderful she helped us the whole weekend even after the fire when people broke into the home. When channel 13, 10 came out to interview us due to the fire and the 7 strangers that saved our animals, we were told by Cornette that we don’t have to worry that we will have first dibs on a place that we like through them. Cornette gave me back my deposit and the rent for January which I though was more than wonderful.  Well, after the smoke cleared it went from we will help you don’t worry to you have to fill out another application and start from scratch. I was like okay, I though since I was already with your company and the fire wasn't my fault it didn't even start in my unit that I would get help from them. Not sure what‘s going on. I have been homeless for a month now my animals are in the pet day care until I can find something. I thought that cornette would help me and I found a place but now it’s taking a long time to even process the application they told me that I had to fill out.  I fill like since the fire they are using me as an example to do things right but for what? I was just an innocent person living in my unit and now this happens. I stayed with Cornette because they know my history and I thought I was good with them but I guess that has all changed. I’m just is shock they were so nice to us and everything. I’m starting to think maybe they just did that for the news people to make themselves look good. I not sure but I do know this the office staff that I have met are very nice and Judy Cornette was wonderful went I was crying in the office so maybe they don’t know about thee lady Megan that  handles the  application processing  she tells me that she called me when she really didn't. its people like the lady that showed the place and other people in the office that brings them down so I would Judy the  company as a whole just some of the people in the office that makes them look bad because like I said Nancy, Judy and the front office staff is great and even thou I’m  getting the run around form the application process lady I would still refer people to them to rent because before the fire  and after they have still been nice to  me.</text>

Lived in a Cornette managed property for 4 years. They have no respect for anybody. My rent was increased twice because I had placed a maintenance request. They charged me 40 dollars for overpaying the rent. They tried to convince me that I had to be out of the house 21 days before my lease was up after I paid to the end of the month. Then told me I cannot get my money back. They try to charge me 10 dollars  more then the contractors bid to replace a pain of glass. Not good people to work with. I will post again after the final inspection with a link to the video.<//Text>

I have to say that this has been the worst experience ever and absolutely zero customer service!!! None of you talk to each other and just put notes on a computer and hope eventually somebody reads it. I know because i went into the office personally this morning. The girl at the front desk is really friendly but my weiner dog has a better chance at processing information. You guys sent the wrong people the wrong information to process and I have potentially lost out on good homes because of your lack of communication and effort. I understand you are busy and have other things going on but figure out how to multi task a bit better. This is rediculous!!! Rest assured I will never deal with you guys and this is going to be posted!

If you are looking to use cornette... DON'T!!! RUN AWAY< /text>

{'time': 1524605007631, 'text': 'As explained in our phone conversation on April 20th 2018 the application was denied based on false tenancy verification.  The person that we reached out to regarding your rental verification for your current tenancy verification stated that he was the homeowner of the property you currently reside at.  We do check ownership on any rental verification where the person we reach out to states they are the home owner.  In this case the homeownership did not match.  At that time the application was denied on a false tenancy verification.  We emailed you the reason for the denial on 04/10/2018 and mailed out a hard copy of the denial on 04/12/2018 to your most recent address listed on the application.  We did not hear anything from you until you emailed asking for more details on the denial on 04/20/2018.  I reached out to you via phone to discuss the denial that same day.  At that time, I explained to you the reason for the denial being a false tenancy verification we received.   Only at that time did you explain to me that the person who gave the verification was a Broker and not the Homeowner.  There was no other way we would have known that information.  It was not previously disclosed to us on the application.   The Broker also did not disclose to us the he was a Broker and managed the property for the home owner. During the duration of our phone conversation I did ask you if your co-applicant was related to your current home owner due to the last names being the same.  We see family members giving false tenancy verifications all the time and have to ask that question or there would have been no other way to know if they were related or not.  You were able to clear that up for us by telling me that they were not related.  I was very clear that was not the reason for the denial or we would have had to disclose that when the denial email went out along with the hard copy letter that was mailed out to you.  After everything was disclosed during our phone conversation we had discussed for you to send over your lease agreement and that I would reach out to the Broker again to clear up the wrongful verification he did on his end and that we would be able to move forward with placing your application towards another property.  The property you had originally applied for had been rented.  I suggested that you visit our website over the weekend and see if there were any other properties you would be interested in.  We were willing to clear up the situation regarding your rental history and move forward.  Not once during our phone conversation did you mention anything about being racially profiled, which is not the case.  We are very strict about following all fair house rules and regulations and the denial was strictly based on the Broker giving a false tenancy verification that he was the homeowner.'}< /Response>

<Review>Disappointed in this place. Me and my significant other were denied for a property because the owner of my current property has the same last name as my significant other. Smh I’ve never heard of something so rediculous in my life. I provided my property managers contact information as this is the person I signed my lease agreement with as well as worked with for my entire stay. I’ve never met the owner of my current home, and was told because my property manager circled that he was the owner and the owner has the same last name as my significant other I was denied. I was told that they thought that we were doing something fraudulent. I’ve never been treated this way before and I’m offended. I mean my significant other has a very common Hispanic last name and it just so happens that the owner of my property has the same last name. In addition my significant other moved to California in 2015 when we began dating, lol and I signed my lease in 2013. I was clearly denied for an assumption, when I paid my money to receive a proper background check which didn’t happen. I was then told that they now see that my property management does work for a legit company, but why was this not researched before denying me. Now the property that I applied for is rented and I lose my money. Seriously disappointed.</Review>< time>

It seems that all these negative reviews are from people that got denied for bad credit. Well it clearly states the qualifications on the application, so its not really anyone fault except the people with poor credit. I think its great that cornette accepts co signers ,a lot of companies do not do that. Elena the girl who answered the phones explained all of this to me and I'm glad she was clear and consise in regards to the qualifications.</text>

<review>Stay away from this company. Rented a home for over a year. The house was over 30 yrs old with minimal upgrades. It served its purpose for our family during that time. I paid the rent on time and left the home in the same condition as when I moved in. California law states a landlord has 21 days to return the security deposit or provide an estimate of damages. On the 21 day mark I received a estimate of damage my equaling $2100 security deposit. They were bogus claims and issues present prior to moving in. In addition they estimated I owed them an additional 250. I have the move in inspection report with pictures as well took move out pictures and video. They will not look at it until all work is complete. It's now over 60 days no word from conrnette and I've been told they are still waiting on work to be done to the home. It's funny there are already tenants living in it. they are exploiting the renter population unethical business practices.</review>< UserId.>

<review>I'm a tenant and have lived at the same property for over 2 years. I called over a month ago about my leaking roof. Still no response. Would you want a property you own having a leaking roof during rain season and them sitting on their thumbs?

I put my 30 day notice in because I am buying a house, and they made an appointment to show the residence without my consent when the property is still OCCUPIED!

They do not return phone calls, and they do not respond to maintenance problems.< /review><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

<text>I had to call after hours today to get my AC fixed. Although I could tell Gloria was very annoyed that I called, she did get someone to my place within an hour and the guy was quick and very polite (this review in no way reflects his service). During normal hours I can reach them via email which is great and I am getting a good price on my unit. There were a few misunderstandings in the beginning on when each water bill was due, when I asked they didn't seem to really know, so I just had to wait and see what I was going to get billed. Sonya is nice, Brittney is mean. Haven't worked with Nancy but heard she is nice. They have really good prices on rent and I'm not going to lie, I love my place and I can deal with their rudeness if I have to lol< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I would love to give a negative star review. LOVE TO. Cornette has been shady from the word go. The first time I ever went in to their office I heard a manager tell one of the staff that someone had just called to complain about them but not to worry about it because she didn't care about the person who called. Nevertheless, we rented. The carpets weren't cleaned when we moved in (Cornette assured us they had been, but there was only so much the cleaners could do.) About 8 months into the first year of our lease Cornette sent us a letter to let us know we owed them $2. From 6 months ago. Odd, ridiculous even, but we paid. Maintenance is a joke. We have had contractors come out to fix something and then stumble across another issue, which they say they'll tell Cornette about because all repairs have to be approved by them. Didn't hear back from Cornette at all, and they only did anything when we asked them why they hadn't. Currently we've been dealing with an AC repair issue for a month and a half. Nancy is condescending and unprofessional, refusing to do so much as make a phone call to the contractor to ask them to work with us to come to the house when the problem is occurring. I asked her literally 5 times for her supervisor's contact information. She told me I could call the office, and when I FINALLY got an email address from her, as I work during Cornette's open hours and can't really tear myself away to deal with their buffoonery, she followed up with an email saying that the owner, Judy Cornette, wouldn't open or read any email that wasn't from anyone she specifically requested an email from or already knew. Clearly she really wants to discuss her customers issues with the horrible service they're receiving. She probably encourages it based on the attitudes I've gotten. I would also invite you to read the comments below where whoever is responding to these reviews totally revealed private financial information about someone who had applied. SUPER professional and not at all ethically reprehensible. And based on the other reviews, I can't wait to fight with them for months about our security deposit after we move out. NEVER RENT FROM CORNETTE.< /Text>
<Time>1501903789785< /Time><response>{'time': 1503002333054, 'text': 'Hello Casey: In regards to the maintenance issues, you have stated that Nancy did not call the contractor to ask them to work with you to come to the house when the problem is occurring. To the contrary, Nancy spoke to the contractor and informed them of the intermittent problem with your air conditioner. The vendor came to the house, but could not duplicate the problem. You were also told that because the issues were intermittent and only lasted a few hours, the vendor may not have someone in the area and/or able to pull off a job to come to the house, and informed by Nancy that air conditioners, due to age, will sometimes turn off and/or blow warm air in extreme temperatures. Your air conditioner (upstairs only) would blow warm air for a few hours and then start blowing cold. Per the HVAC repairman this is very indicative of air conditioner units in extreme weather. After not hearing back from you, it was assumed the issue was fixed. Especially since the extreme weather had passed. It would have been greatly appreciated if you contacted our office with your concerns when the owner reached out to you rather than passively posting a review online.                                                                                Prior to you taking occupancy of your residence the carpets were professionally cleaned by Fairest of All Carpet Cleaning on 12/01/2015 and you moved into the property on 12/04/2015. On the invoice from the carpet cleaning company and the move in inspection, the condition of the carpet has been noted.\nOur collection department automatically sends out letters through our software program regarding a delinquent balance regardless of the total amount past due, this is why you received the letter.\nYou stated the first time you came to the office you heard a manager tell one of the staff members to not worry about a compliant received as we did not care about the person who had called. We would never discuss matters of conflict with staff members at the front desk, all complaints and concerns are addressed appropriately when received in our office.\nRegarding contacting the owner at Cornette Property Management, there was never an email or voicemail received from you. After you were given the name, phone number and email of the owner, you state you would contact the owner but to date she has not received a message from you. Nancy and the owner left a message for you on your voicemail and there was no response. The emails between you and Nancy have been reviewed and her replies to you were professional, courteous, and informative.\nIn regards to your comment about releasing personal information in a response below; unfortunately, when someone publicly lists slanderous and false allegations, we must be able to respond to their claims. Without factual statements and responses in return, we would not be able to respond to these allegations.'}</response><Gmap_id>0x809ae6d321497795:0x4483e9b3b9fd83bb</Gmap_id><Pics>None< /Pics><Rate>1< /Rate><name>Casey Manno< /name></record>

After dealing with their voicemail for a week to know this property was still on the market. DontD waste your time with these people they are incredibly unprofessional and a waste of time.

I called cornette to complain they said they would call me back on Friday to reschedule a showing itsi now 3 weeks later and cornette never called or attempted to contact me.< /Text>< userid>

What can I say, if you can read the reviews that is enough for you to decide whether you are playing with fire. This company is not in business to service the community. It seems like they don't make enough profit so the best profit is to target their customer. Cornette model "Let's rip off our client." Also, they won't call you back so don't expect it, each rep will always say call back on Blahh blah blah date. Be smart, invest your money in another company. If you absolutely have no where to go, and probably not in the best shape in your life, maybe. Just don't say you never been warn</review>

Cornett property took over a rental I was already in, I was a very good tenant, gave them 30 days notice when I was ready to move to a closer area to work, I was not allowed to do a walk through after I moved out so I did take pictures, Judy sent me a refund check for a full refund of my deposit (cause I left that place clean)but only she wrote the date wrong so I was not able to cash the check!  I called and was told to come on in and pick up another check (30 minutes away) to be told Judy left on vacation!!!!!  I had to act out of my character because the whole office was lying to me, after making a claim with the BBB I finally received another check, Judy Cornett is definetly something else and I will never rent from her again!!!< /Text>< user_id>

{'time': 1520372831008, 'text': "Hello Andrew, To this day we are currently waiting on the prior landlord verifications for both you and the other applicant you've applied with. When you came into the office on Tuesday, I personally gave you an update regarding your application, also you selected a specific property to transfer your application to at that time. For the other applicants prior tenancy verification we have faxed it out on 2/22/18, 2/23/18, and 2/26/18 - We also emailed this three different times on 2/26/18, 2/27/18 and 3/5/18. For your prior tenancy verification we had to leave a message on 02/22/18 and 02/23/18 prior to getting an actual email to send the verification for completion. This verification has now been emailed three times 2/26/18, 2/27/18, and 3/2/18.  On several different occasions I asked you and the other applicant to reach out to your prior landlords to notify them I was trying to obtain these verifications to complete your application. I had also suggested to the other applicant via email on 2/28/2018 that if either one of you would like to schedule an appointment with me in office I would be more than willing to sit down and show you all the emails and proof of attempts to both your prior landlords. There was never an attempt on your end to schedule that appointment."}< /Resp>

It’s been two weeks since me and my other filed a pre-approval application. Every time I call back to check on the status I keep getting told that they haven’t heard a response from our previous landlords. I called both of them twice, and cornette never attempted to contact them. I keep feeling like cornette is blowing me off in the most unprofessional way. This company is extremely inefficient and lazy. They gladly took my money for the application but don’t want to do their job.< /review>

This company is horrible! With the exception of Shannon, who should really go to a better company.

If you rent from them, expect to be charged $200+, even if you clean the residence immaculately. They sent us the refund of our deposit the day before 21 days were up. And this is for a place that we had to clean ourselves before we moved in! There were dings in the walls, no hanger bars in the closets, permanent markers on some of the walls, and what looked like gel icing drawn on the wall in the bathroom.

Avoid this company like the plague!< /text>

I wouldn't even waste your time applying with them. Honestly it seems like they only want your application fee, act like they are going to approve you, and then send a denial letter the same day. And then they won't tell you why they denied you. I've called and asked many times and all they say is "we can't disclose that" or "you have to call the creditor ". Waste of money and time.< /Text>

As written by my g.f.
"I only completed the first few steps with Cornette and the decided not to rent from then after dealing with their horrible communication and even worse reviews.

I applied online and that was the only good/ easy part of the process. It took them 3 weeks to process our application. They NEVER return voicemails and it took multiple calls throughout the day to even get ahold of someone to check on things (they never gave us solid answers). When my application was going up the chain they said it takes how long it takes and their is no time frame to let me know if I was approved for the property. A week later when they called to let us know we were approved was the only time they acted semi professional they wanted us to put down a nonrefundable deposit before we could even see the house.

After debating over night with my partner we decided not to rent from them due to almost everyone stating that repairs were not made and deposits were stolen upon move out and the updates were done."</text>

Terrible company. Everything about it is a joke. Reading other reviews is pretty spot on from what we have observed from renting from them for 3 months. Maintenance is a complete joke. Took 3 weeks for them to fix a dishwasher which was very annoying. It has been over 3 weeks and we have not been able to use our master bath shower because the glass shower door had shattered due to faulty installation. (And yes the heavy glass door fell on my wife and shattered while she was in the shower leaving a complete bloody, mess).</Text>

At the time you had called into our office, we were accepting applications; however, due to how competitive the rental market is at this time some prospective tenants are putting in applications prior to viewing a property. Even though we have reached our maximum intake of processing applications, the property has not been rented and there is not a deposit placed in order to remove the property from our available listings. It is not uncommon that once we’ve began processing an application, the applicant does not qualify and we are able to accept more applications. Nonetheless a pending application does not guarantee the property has been rented, as the status of an application can change at any given time for various reasons. When our agents and/or representatives are made available for showings they don’t always come to the office. Again the status of an application can change at any time making it near impossible to be able to allow for accurate information, unless of course by speaking with our office staff directly. You are always welcome to contact our office to inquiry about an application status prior to viewing a property.'}<//resp>

Went to a viewing of a duplex yesterday, was really excited, given applications and was told we could bring them in the next morning. Well we spent all morning getting everything we need together and we get there and they said they are maxed out on apps and aren't accepting anymore. I asked if they knew that yesterday when they were showing the place and was told that the agent who scheduled the showing may not have know because they don't keep in contact like that. Not sure if this is the norm for other property management companies but it's very unprofessional.</Text>

People, stay away from this company, the only reason these people are in business is because high rent prices in the area.  I hope the real estate bubble bursts and these liars are out of business.  They stole more than $1600. People be ware they will rent you a dirty place, and when you move out and leave it in the same condition, they will tell you, that you should have left it in cleaner shape than when you moved in.<//Review>

This is a SLUM lord company. They bait and switched me on the unit they advertised stating the one advertised is not available for another two weeks. After moving in to Timberlake Lake condos there were many problems with the unit. Leaking faucet wasp nests on the deck. After my year lease expired they raised my rent stating unforseen costs. Upon moving out I gave writen 30 day notice and called and emailed them when the unit would be vacant. I spoke with Jessica who was very rude to me and stated they never got my 30 day notice and will charge me an additional 30 days rent due to that. I explained they got a lower rent check which included the notice but they did not ask why the rent was short, so they got thenotice. Now they are trying to charge an additional months rent or more. I delt with the VERY RUDE JESSICA! I will now have to fight them in court.< /review>

Anyways this shittyass company have no customer service. I called the office and they said supposedly the guy waited for 7 mins and noone showed up and i told her how could that be?

You are also reminded in the lease signing to double check everything entered into the online system to make sure it is correct because we do not have access to your payment portal. It is not our responsibility to remind you of the terms of your lease, it is your responsibility.\n\nAt the time you inquired about July's rent you still had a balance due so yes you would have been told that the payment needed to be money order or cashier’s check.\n\nPlease refer to your lease page 2 Section 9 Return Payment: It states: Tenant agrees to pay Landlord $25.00 for each return check or returned online payment regardless of the reason it is returned and replace such payment with certified check or money order.

Oh my goodness! someone on here mentioned Gloria! I couldnt believe the reviews i was reading and how i could relate to some of the things that were being said here. Gloria has the worst customer service ever. I work in sales, specifically mortgage refinances, and I had called to ask about a home for rent, Gloria was the one who answered and acted like her time was so precious and didnt want to talk to me or tell me about the property. Then she proceeded to tell me its not available and that she doesnt know why they posted it online... I asked about the application process, she tells me to go online and figure it out... I am so shocked on how this company handles customer inquires.. I know if I acted like this everytime someone called about a mortgage, I'd be out of a job...

I hope people read these reviews, because they are so real.. if you dont believe us, give them a call yourself...

poor poor service!!!</Text>

I can't say enough bad about this company. EVERY single person that works there besides Ruth, who left a long time ago (and warned me about the service level and lies) has horrible customer service, horrible follow up, and they LIE!!!!!!!!!!! My husband and I rented a Lincoln house on Laehr Drive and just moved out in July 2012. Wonderful nieghbors, the owner of the property and Cornette made our stay there one of the worst years. I have rented a TON of houses, aptartments,duplexes and have NEVER EVER had such a miserable, horrible, never to forget this nightmare experience. CORNETTE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT~ YOU F~ING SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</review>

From the previous reviews I have read, Cornette seems to be a pretty decent property management company for people who own property which is managed by Cornette.  I, on the other hand, am a renter and have had a horrible experience with the company.  I actually don't rent from them but was treated So poorly during the process of being approved for a property that I just said "forget it" and walked away from the property.  Originally I found a property online that would become available Aug. 1.  Keep in mind they listed the property WEEKS before it was available.  So I called multiple times to keep up with the date the townhome would become available and to ask any general questions regarding deposits and such.  I called a few days before the 1st to confirm that it would still be available and was told that someone had already turned in an aplication and had been approved.  For some odd reason I called back a day or so later and was told that the property was actually still available but that it was now not going to be vacated until the 8th.  I was going to be out of the country starting the 11th so I made the decision to drive from downtown to Orangevale to drop off an application so that if I were approved, I would be the 1st person to view the property.  Cornette recieved my app on a Friday and said I would be notified when I had been approved and once they recieved the keys.  When I never heard from them that Monday I called Tuesday to find out if I had been approved and was told I would have to speak with Shannon.  I left her a voicemail but never heard back.  I left for vacation and when I returned on the 16th (10 days after I have turned in my application) I still have no messages from Cornette or Shannon.  I called and left another message for Shannon and was told that the company was having a "hard time getting the keys."  This was weird and confusing to me and I was pretty fed up and told them that I was no longer interested in that property but if my applicatio stayed on file I would keep looking.  I was then told that my application had never been processed!!! I told the girl I was very displeased with the lack of communication on their part and to just shred my check and left ANOTHER message for Shannon to call me to make sure this happened.  It is now Aug. 30 and after 2 more messages to Shannon, I have STILL never recieved a call back. Not once.  How frustrating and disappointing.  I'm not sure how companies are capable of running on such blatant rudeness and miscommunication.  A simple call back after many messages would have been nice and would have kept me from feeling the need to write a bad review.........< /Review>

{'time': 1503006745994, 'text': 'Hello Tim: You have accused us of contacting your place of employment. As you are fully aware, you have been communicating with the owner of the property, who is not an employee of Cornette Property Management. The communication with the owner was regarding the shared cost of the replacing and repairing the fence which separates the two properties. After numerous threats that you had been consulting with legal counsel and city inspector while using your official Governor’s office email, the property homeowner contacted the Director in the Governor’s office to put a stop to receiving these email correspondences. The property homeowner did not think it was appropriate for you to email him in this context, especially when using your official work email from the Governor’s office.  Due to the fact that you used a work email to communicate with the property homeowner, he had the contact information to communicate with your office.\n\nSeveral times in the emails sent to you, the property homeowner had agreed to pay 50% of the reasonable costs to replace and/or repair the common fence by a licensed and professional contractor. The estimate received from you to fix the fence was more expensive than a licensed contractor, and you moved your fence approximately 10’ closer to the street adding to the shared cost of materials and the property homeowner stated he is not willing to pay more to expand your backyard.\n\nUntil you wrote the review about our company, we had never had any contact or correspondence from or to you, your communication and dealings had been directly with the homeowner of the property. We consider your actions to be slanderous and defamatory toward our business as you have knowingly posted false allegations. We would have expected more integrity from someone who works in the Governor’s office.'}</resp>

Cynthia my tax professional was phenomenal. She was clear and patient with me throughout the whole process. Uploading my documents on MyBlock was simple and hassle free. I felt like the entire process was easy to understand and accommodating towards my concerns with Covid-19.</Review>

<review>Cynthia Cady-Mabon is an awesome tax advisor. I truly trust her advise and have no doubt that my taxes are done not only correctly and ethically as well. I have had H&R Block process my taxes for 10+ years and will continue to do so in the future.< /review>< Pics>

I think I was actually doing my return correctly using an online tool.  It was vastly cheaper than H&R so I, though not as easy, I may go back to that online service.</text>

Laura helped me out a couple of weeks ago and she was very pleasant and professional. Laura made the process of renting a unit that I needed very smoothly and efficiently. While this unit is the same size I had at a previous storage place and a little more expensive, StorQuest is closer to home, cleaner, and more professional in their customer service and in maintaining the units. Definitely worth the price so far. Thank you, Laura!</review>

The price I pay for a 10 by 10 is very reasonable, and the crew...especially "ANDREA" who manages the unit facilities at Storquest is so nice and knowledgeable about our storage  needs. She is awesome! Thanks Andrea! Sincerely, Roderick.</Review>< Pictures>

Andrea was great! I told her I had two light bulbs out in my unit and in no time she came over and replaced them. She was courteous and friendly. She demonstrated great customer service. She is a very good asset to your Storquest team!<//review>

Do not put your storage items in here.why?
1) they did not inform me of the administration fee when I called.
2) they will force you to buy their expensive locks. Owners are so greedy.
3) storage price is so expensive compared to the others in the area.
4) they do not have even a complementary trash bins. Talk about human kindness. Lacking of human kindness. We really are in the last days!<//review>

Awesome service and facility was clean and secure.  The manager Carlos was very kind and concerned that we had the best size unit for what we needed to store.  His professionalism and concern for his customers made me and my husband decide on the spot!  We got a great deal and you cannot beat their service.  Yes...I recommend them.</review>

Shopped around for storage units online and ended up visiting here. Came to storquest and was met by a super friendly staff. They showed me the unit i was looking for and a few more to get an idea of what would work best for me. The facility was neat and clean. They answered all my questions with a smile and great attitude. If you're looking for storage I highly recommended them! Keep up the great work StorQuest.</text>

Rented a unit today. The person in the office - Carlos
was exceptionally courteous and helpful. He answered all my questions - I usually have several.
The facility is clean and well lite at night.
Carlos lives at the facility, which is a huge plus.

<review>I came in with a friend to look at a storage and I couldn’t ask for a better experience. The people at the front desk were nice (Andrea and Carlos) and welcoming. They showed us different prices of different storage rooms, weren’t pushing us to get a storage right away and allowed us to think over which one we wanted. There are no hides fees and u can ask as many questions as you like. So if you are looking for a storage give them a call.</review>< Pics>

<Text>Andrea, at the location on Jones Way in Oxnard stayed late to help me close out my unit. I couldn't fit everything in my car that morning so I had to come back. With traffic I got there just minutes to closing. Even though after she finished with a customer that was there before me, and in doing so when it was my turn the time was after closing, Andrea stayed late to help me settle so I would not have to spend hours to come back again.  Every one of their staff have always been helpful. Thank You, -Keith<//Text>< Rate>

Andrea is incredibly kind, considerate and knowledgeable. Today, I was so stressed to the point of tears, however, Andrea was able to look at my options and make an exerted effort to solve my problem. I truly appreciate her understanding and support. I will recommend this company because of her exceptional service.</Review>

< Review>
We definitely are not in the south. Southern hospitality is not in the office at all. They always have a sharp response for whatever you say. Went to use the restroom during opening hours and they told me that i couldn't because they had put chemicals in the toilet so i had to leave.If i pay every month then should have a restroom to use. They have a cart but you have to give them collateral for it!!!! Thats crazy!!!They are only open from like 9-6 so you better get in there early or you have no access to your things!!!!Wow!! They are never in the office or they are in the office on lunch. Most importantly they wont prorate your unit if you check out shortly after you give them money.They just keep the money!!! That is robbery!!! I didn't know that when i moved in!!!!! Only positives about this place is that they are gated and clean.<//Review>

I visited storquest in the past, so I didn't hesitate to use them again. I am moving and I needed to declutter my home for showings. I visited storquest and was greeted by Andrea. She helped me, following all covid19 guidelines, and in no time  I had the unit available. The unit was clean and I was loading within a couple hours. I recommend storquest for all your storage needs.< /Text>

Another 5 stars for storquest in oxnard. Andrea was extremely helpful when the time came to clear out my storage unit. She was quick and informative and very nice the whole time. The customer service at storquest jones drive has been nothing but spectacular throughout my time doing business with storquest and I will definitely return to them for any future storage needs and will be referring them to friends and family as well. Thanks storquest.<//Review>

After having my storage unit for a few years we needed to downsize the storage due to cost increase. The staff was very polite and considerate. They made the transfer to a smaller unit as easy as possible, and gave me a promo cost on the new unit😁. And since I have direct payment set up I get more access hours 👍<//review>

Very good prices.  Sometimes they have deals for military.  They do automatic payments, but not from your checking account, but to your credit card account.  If you get a new cc, then don't forget to update them so your payments don't bounce and you get late fees.  Customer service is good when they are present.  A couple times I showed up to the office during office hours when nobody was there.  They were out showing a unit to a potential customer, so I ended up waiting about 30 minutes before they came back to the office.< /review>

I am active duty military stationed in Port Hueneme Ca. I needed a storage unit the was looking all over Ventura county for a unit. I used Storquest and the facility and grounds are very clean and secure. The staff is friendly, professional and very helpful. Especially Mrs. Andrea! She took the time to explain every detail clearly and is the epitome of a professional Manager.
Thanks you!!!< /Text>

< Review>
I called for information, and a young man helped me on the phone. He really knew his stuff when it came to storage units! I decided to have him hold the unit for me.
When I arrived, the property was clean, well kept, and the storage doors were painted red, and looked good from the outside.
Andrea, the young lady who helped me was the best! She was friendly, conscientious, and wasted no time giving me a tour and showing me the available unit. The unit itself was very clean, had light inside which operates from a timer right outside the doorway, and the rollup door was easy to operate. The unit was just the right size, between a 10x20 and a 10x30, which was perfect for what I needed, and reasonably priced compared to many I had prospected before this storage facility. Andrea was very fast in drawing up the contracts...insurance here is required, but was very inexpensive for the amount of coverage it provides. Andrea went over the entire contract, informing me of all necessary rules and regulations, and provided me with my gate code,and overall just made the whole experience very easy and quick.
I would definitely recommend this facility to anyone needing a storage unit in the Oxnard area!!<//Review>

Even late on a Friday afternoon the staff was eager to help me find a unit that would meet my needs. Staff is super friendly and the grounds are impeccably clean. The rental process is extremely easy, and fast.< /review>

The customer service I received from Andrea was very professional from the moment I walked in the door. I have never had an issue with her or any employee. The tour that Andrea provided me and the assistance that was provided for the administrative portion to complete my contract was very appreciated. The facility is very clean and safe for all your storage needs. I recommend this storage to anyone who wants their valuables and belongings to be safe. GREAT JOB Andrea!!!! If I could provide I higher rating I would. Thanks for the great professional customer service.< /review>

<review>Carlos was all about customer service which is hard to get with many other businesses. He was more than willing to help me out with all of my needs. Service there was outstanding and I'd recommend going there for reasonable prices and wonderful customer service. A safe and clean facility in Oxnard with an amazing staff. I have been a customer there for years and will continue to use them for any of my future storage needs.

I have been renting with them for the past 15 years off and on. The staff are so helpful and they go out of their way to make sure you are happy with all your storage needs. Carlos is such a hard working employee and he is fast and efficient, getting me in and out of the office and into a new unit each time. Thank you<//review>< Name>

The woman who works the front counter when you walk in is incredibly rude but when you leave she tries to be polite to customers so they can give her 5 stars on google... she claimed there were no cockroaches in the building, but to my astonishment they were everywhere on the first day I got there...

This place looks amazing it was clean from the outside and inside when I was greeted by the property manager she was very nice and professional she was able to answer all my questions and the prices were unbelievable she was able to help me get a good deal and not feel like I was getting ripped off I would definitely recommend this to my family and friends.

<Review>We had the pleasure to deal with Magnolia and Andrea they were very helpful and knowledgeable on their duties and responsibilities here at the facility. I appreciate a clean and neat facility to do business with. The location is centralized and the hours for the location worked with our needs. I would highly recommend anyone to stop by and tour the place to see it for them selfs. Great place all around starting with the staff.</Review>< rate>

I use the StorQuest in Oxnard. I have two large units, one for my bussines and another for personal. The facilities are very clean, and seems to be all brand new. I really like the spacious driving area's because it makes driving my utility trailer easy. The units are strong clean and secure. Andrea has always helped me when I needed it.  She's always on top of things. You can count on her when you need assistance. StorQuest should be proud to have Andrea there taking care of things. Thanks StorQuest. Christopher<//Text>

< Review>
The live-in manager Maggie has the absolute worst customer service.  I don't have a storage unit here, thank goodness, but I did recently attempt to assist a friend move some large furniture.

While waiting for my friend, to meet me at this facility, a unidentified woman walked up to my truck, located outside of the gate and took a picture.  I confronted the woman and she immediately hid a name tag on her shirt.  She said that I was on private property and when I asked her why she was hiding her name tag, she then reviled that her name was Maggie, and employee and that I had to leave.  I informed her that I was waiting for a friend and she still insisted that I leave the premises. Does that mean, that unless you have a storage unit at that location you can't assist a tenant?

Although I had unknowingly backed into a handicap spot with my vehicle still running while sitting inside she proclaimed I was in violation of the law and had to move off the property not allowing me to pull forward into a vacant parking spot.  I complied and vacated the premises.  I thanked her for her treatment of U.S. Military personnel and left before my friend arrived.

I strongly advise all of my fellow military service members from renting a storage unit at this property or any other StorQuest Self Storage.  By the way, Maggie, if your property really is under surveillance 24/7/365 as the sign on your gate indicates then there was no need for you to take a picture of my truck with your personal camera phone,  and the video evidence would confirm everything I posted here.< /Review>

Maggie is the best! I was paying WAY too much for a unit over at Golden State, and since I'm deploying soon, I needed to get something a bit larger. The one I was going to get at Golden State was going to cost me $459. For basically the same size, I am paying less than half the price. This place is much cleaner and friendlier, too! If you go in, ask for Maggie and say that I sent yah! :P I would definitely recommend this place to anybody that doesn't want to pay an arm and a leg just to store some belongings! Hands down best decision I've made in a while!< /review>

These ladies are absolutely awesome. Maggie the property manager is Extremely helpful and willing to accommodate.  Every time Ive had to go into the office and speak to one of the staff Ive always been impressed with how knowledgeable they are in regards to their individual accounts and thats what customer service is all about. Thats what gives it that Personal kind of touch and makes you feel like an individual and NOT like your "just another number" the way most businesses do. If you have any type of questions or concerns they Address it promptly, answered/resolved with the customers satisfaction put first.  I recommend this place every time someone asks me about storage places. A shinning example of Awesome  customer service !!<//review>

Andrea was very helpful in getting me set up with my new unit. The facility is very clean. I saw plenty of security cameras running, so I know my stuff will be safe. If the rest of the staff is as friendly as Andrea is, I look forward to doing business here.<//review>

I just recently obtained a large unit at this facility and I couldn't be happier! Prior to my move in date I reserved my unit right days in advance. The policy is that they will hold that unit four seven days. On the seventh day I was scheduled to come I and soon my paperwork but I had unfortunate events come up that day so I called in to see if I could still keep the reservation at that price. The manager called me immediately and generously held the unit and I met her right at open the next day to do my walk through and sign my papers. She even allowed the movers to start while we finished the paperwork. It was a military move on a 40 foot flat bed. I do recommend anything over 40 feet if in the back of the facility to use the middle road (only one with steep incline) to get to your unit. Will save time and any unnecessary damage! The woman who helped me was accommodating to all of my questions and concerns and the facility is very clean with very competitive prices.</Text>

<text>The manager Maggie is an uneducated and racist person, she is always in a bad mood, for 2 months we could not use the bathroom for clients because she said it did not work, we complained that our unit had urine and rat excrement and never did anything. Thanks to maggie's BAD service we found a better storage where they have very professional staff.< /text><user_name>Veronica Morales<//user_name><rating>1< /rating>< Response>

<Date>1526680103228<//Date><rating>1< /rating><Text>The worse place I have ever stored at.  Maggie and Andrea are friendly and upbeat at the beginning,  even wanting you to rate them on google at the moment you sign up for a unit.  Then when the Manager, Maggie is asking for a washer/dryer in a unit we won at auction, but we end up selling it to a tenant who inquired and had the money instead of waiting and holding it for Maggie, she gets upset and even tells us she is mad at us for not holding it for her.  Who does that??  Shame on you Storagequest to have your employees, yet alone a Manager who tries to conduct a business sale during her business hours and theb after treats us like we are dirt and makes us feel uncomfortable to use the restrooms or ask questionm. She snubs us when we try to say hi and gives us a mean look and just cold when we ask questions.  Then she started harassing us about me moving my vehicle and parking at emegency gate so I am not in other tenants way.  Normal protocol in a storage unit is be courteous and move when other tenant arrives, that you have blocked.  Then it was us not punching in our code and went in after another tenant punched his.  i never had problems before and surely they never scold the other tenants when they follow pursuit after punching our codes in.  Oh...and the rat feces and rats are a bit of a problem and they also let a few customers use their storage as a workshop of some sort.  You got the mechanic working on his truck in 1 unit.  You have another man grinding, cutting on his saw table to make surfboards.   This goes on during day and evening.  You even have the mariachi bands blasting their Banda music, singing and drinking cold ones.  Maybe if Storequest better trained these 2 unprofessional ladies by having them get off their behinds and work a little, like picking up trash, being more pleasant and seeing activities going on and puttting a stop to it, then maybe Storequest would be better.  Also,  Storequest, you need to get better exterminators.  Yes.  I am glad I left and went back to my other storage facility who treat their tenants with respect and dont harrass them for items they need.  Poor management and customer service<//Text>< Pics>

< review>
Sun 7/2/2017 Friendly service and clean facilities. However, at the time I visited, the person at the desk told me there were two other customers ahead of me and that I may have to wait. I patiently waited, but when it was close to my turn, the person said that another customer was ahead of me which didn't make sense. The guy wasn't even there when I arrived at the building. I saw him busy using his cell phone parked by the street inside a dark colored walk in van later on (license plate EXTRM 8). I didn't want to be rude so I let it go. This costed the review 1 star. But since I had to wait some more (about 1hr 30 min total), that costed another star.
I'm taking away another star because of a big security vulnerability on their storage units and also because the next day I visited, the person behind the desk was rude. I guess she didn't like the first version of my review that's why she had a bit of an attitude towards me. Part of the reason I came back the next day was because the previous person entered my email incorrectly. The next person assumed I made the mistake by asking why I didn't correct it the first time. But it was actually entirely the first person's fault. So instead of 3 stars yesterday, I'm dropping it down to 2.
The big security vulnerability is the way the storage units are separated from each other. They are separated using corrugated sheet metal with screws attaching them to a bracket. I noticed that the corrugated sheet metal were made of 3 separate pieces. If the adjacent storage unit has access to the hex head of the screw, someone can remove enough of those screws to remove one or more of the metal panels and gain access to your storage unit. This way, it wouldn't matter if you had a lock installed that can't be picked. Someone can simply access your unit by entering from the sides.
Be careful. It's best to employ some way of detecting if the screws or panels were removed to cover yourself. I have attached a picture of this vulnerability. Notice that the bracket is on my side, you can see the threads of the screw which means the head is accessible from the adjacent unit, and that there is a noticable separation of the metal panels in the middle to show that they are separate. Removing the screws will allow someone to pull the panel off and gain access to my unit.</review>

<text>Where do I start !! The cemetery is a very nice resting place to bury your loved ones it I’ve notice that  over the years it has not been maintained like it use to be.we buried my mother June 12,2020 .3 months ago we picked out my mother’s head stone and we’re told we would be emailed to have the final authorization done to proceed w/ getting it done before my moms 1 year anniversary of death may 21,2021 .

Where do I begin, my husbands father has been buried out here for over 40 years and has not had a head stone. He saved for over a year to pay for this headstone and as a surprise to me got my father a new vase cause over 30 years of being there it was broken and in bad shape. So on April 7,2021 we went up with cash in hand and paid in full for a headstone and a flower vase. We where told the headstone would take 2-3 weeks to get a proof and about a week to get flower vase. After two weeks and the vase not being installed and no proof about headstone we called and no call back. So we waited two more days and went up to office  and talked to the counselor we worked with she insured me the vase was in (we didn't stop at grave site before going to office) and headstone proof will be coming soon she would call on it.  On way out we stopped at father grave no flower vase contact by email and got email back next day stating the vase will be installed that day May 4. May 8 I contacted her by email and told them once again the vase has not been installed. Got nothing back. Two weeks later was contacted by phone and she told us the vase was installed the work order was made for April 22. We went out to cemetery and called her back and told her no vase. We waited for awhile to see if she would call back instead she pulled up on golf cart. We showed her the graves and at that time she informed us she made a mistake and put the vases on someone else grave. And that we would have all this fixed that day cause she was going on vacation. Here I am 11 days from two months and no flower vase and no time line on headstone and no calls or emails back. I understand they have alot going on but come on now. I just want a refund and take my business else where for the headstone and fix the flower vase myself. Not good buiness especially for the price u pay for things.<//Text>

<Review>These people are not trustworthy. Don't listen to them, instead read your contract. They tell you something and in the contract put something else and during the funeral, have you sign other papers without telling you what and bingo, a new bill. Even if it is for a few dollars, they threaten to send you to collection even after you have paid them already more than ten thousand dollars. Don't ignore all the negative reviews.

Full of it. Tried to charge my family $600 to see their husband/dad for 10 min...After they paid the almost $20, 000 funeral balance in full. They have yet to receive a the death certificate (from 1/21). It's May.  It does NOT take that long. I process these daily and it does NOT take 3+months to process a death certificate. Incompetent is an understatement.<//review>

Please I can’t over state this, do not use this place as final resting place for a loved one. They are extremely unprofessional and rude. My father had already made his contract with one of their sales representatives prior to passing and we had to go with them. They stated one thing and did another, when we question it, they are extremely rude, some of their staff even responded with “ we are busy all we want to do is bury one and move to the next as quick as we can, so no accommodation are being done” and walked away. Please use someone else. The area where my dad purchased his plot is dry and dead and they won’t even allow us to try to maintain it .</text>

<Text>I was not satisfied with the quality of service from Montecito. They did not show the utmost respect to my loved one or our family. They made our loss alot more painful. They postponed our loved ones service date because they did not get to the coroner in a timely manner. They admitted they messed up and gave us some money back, but at that point it wasn't about the money! Just not the professional I would expect.

My husband was buried on October 29th and still to this very day has not received his headstone even though everything was paid for a week before his services. The lady Karla who I am working with sent me the same proof two different times and then when she finally sends me the 3rd proof it was still incorrect. When I told her it was still incorrect and I feel that it's taking too long she informed me that she doesn't "design" the headstone. I understand that she doesn't design the headstone but she is the middle man and before even sending me the proof I think she should checking to make sure it is what I have requested. It's so frustrating that  my family go to visit his gravesite and they have to see a little green tag instead of his headstone that was paid for months in advance.</Review>

Awful!! They should at least Act like they care.
We buried my stepfather here on October 2020 and they have not put a headstone yet and have not put the grass either. It’s very sad to go visit him and only see dirt. Even after so many times that we have reported it and asked for them to take care of it they actually had the nerve to tell us that they have been busy and burying the other bodies was their priority. I guess there will only be patches of dirt everywhere since all they care about is burying as much as they can only to collect all the money they can get. Ps Most people we have talked to say they have put the grass themselves and I guess we will too only because my stepdad deserves a beautiful burial. I hope this gets someone to look somewhere else to burry their loved one.</review>

My father passed away on 9/8/2020.  We had the pleasure of working with Karla, Virginia, Lake and John.   All the Montecito staff were very professional and compassionate.  It was easy to communicate about my dad's services from selecting the appropriate package all the way to the day of my dad's funeral.  Everything was well planned and we were given the opportunity to ask questions throughout the process at any time.  Karla took us out on a tour to see the plot and location of burial.  Everything was clearly explained.   The day of the services, we met Lake and John.   Lake was very friendly and easy to talk to.  She was very sympathetic and took the time to talk to us during the ceremony.   I was very thankful for the sincerity and understanding we were given by Lake.  I was very appreciative of our conversations and her friendliness, it made my day go so much smoother.
John was also very thorough and very friendly to work with.  He explained the process to all the pall bearers and the burial services.  We were very lucky with the staff that worked with us.  On behalf of my family,  I would like to thank Montecito for the services provided.  Everything was well organized and  made a very difficult day much more bearable.   We already started pre-planning for my mom's services and plan on returning for future planning of our family as well.  I greatly recommend Montecito Memorial Park and Mortuary.  The scenery is also very calming and peaceful.  Thank-you to all the Montecito staff who helped us get through a very difficult time.</review>

<Review>Used Montecito Mortuary services for my mother’s funeral... won’t be recommending them to anyone in the near future.
The hearse was late to the service...we had to call to find out where they were. Our service started at 10:30am, they showed up around 10:15am.  Which also meant the guest book was put out late because it came with the drivers of the hearse, so our guests had to sign the book on the way OUT of the services.
The slide show provided by Montecito had the computer tool bar showing at the bottom of the screen thru some of it which appeared unprofessional like we made it at home on our own computer instead of having paid good money for it. At the cemetery, they put one of the wreaths the wrong way so you couldn’t read the banner properly. But the most heartbreaking part of it all.. they didn’t even style my mother’s hair even though my Father PAID for it in the pre paid arrangement package (& a picture was sent to the mortuary to show how she normally wore it!). Montecito.. although to You we may only be dollar signs, WE are real live families you are dealing with, and these are some of our darkest and saddest hours of our lives...a day in our lives we will remember for the rest of our lives...a day we will NEVER forget..you would think your company and representatives would act in a more professional and caring manner.</Review>< Pictures>

We can’t thank Sandra at Montecito Memorial park enough for helping us out and coordinating so beautifully our beloved Joseph Padilla’s graveside service. Despite the current circumstances with covid19 she was able to make it very special for us and for that we will always be Thankful and full of gratitude.

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>My mother passed in September. She always wanted to be buried at Montecito, since that’s where her grandparents are buried. If she had known the stress that this facility would put on her family after her death, I’m sure that she would’ve chosen a different funeral home.

Their staff is unprofessional and disorganized. They seem to have it together up until the point that you pay for services. Then their staff becomes unresponsive, rude, and incompetent. I cannot stress enough how unprofessional their staff is. Here are examples of a few (of many!) bad interactions with their staff.

We had a staff member complain about my sister, not knowing that she was in the next room and could hear him.

We had the funeral home call us less than a week prior to my moms funeral claiming that they didn’t receive the casket we shipped them. They were extremely upset and claimed that it was probably too late to order another one in time for the funeral. We had ordered the casket two weeks prior. We asked them if they could check again to ensure that it wasn’t there. They refused to check again and ensured us that they didn’t have it. We contacted the casket company and got confirmation that it was delivered. The next morning, we called Montecito and insisted that they check again. They looked, and the casket was, in fact, at their facility. Very stressful night for us, on top of a very stressful time. All because they couldn’t be bothered to check again to see if the casket was there.

It has been two months since my mom passed away. We paid Montecito for the death certificates. We have not received them, which is needed for life insurance processing. We have called and been assured that “they are processing, COVID is just slowing the courthouse down. Don’t call back, we will call when they come in”. Finally today we call and the lady again tries to brush us off. It’s been two months. We know someone that passed a few weeks ago and their family already got their death certificate. We were adamant to have her check the status of our certificates... only to find out that Montecito never submitted the paperwork to the court. Their response was very flippant, and not at all apologetic. When we reminded Amanda that the burial/funeral was nearly $20,000 and we needed the death certificate for the life insurance, she replied “I don’t know where you got $20,000 from, our records show $8,000.” Great records, Montecito, and even better customer service.

Honestly, I could go on. But these examples certainly give insight as to the company that you’ll have to deal with if your loved one dies. Please, consider using another funeral home. I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dcac65319c9789:0x1198d5135608576a< /Gmap_id>< username>

The staff is extremely rude, they have no respect for the graves. They are so unprofessional. I went into the office to speak to management about maintenance ruining our stuff at our loved one’s gravesite and she only gave me an attitude and was absolutely no help. I don’t recommend this cemetery at all they have no interest in making their customers satisfied.< /review>

<Text>This was the first time experiencing Monticito's services, and they came highly recommended.  The staff I encountered on the phone were kind and friendly, and the staff representatives were equally so.  Lauri was the person I dealt with most of the time, and she couldn't have been more sympathetic or thoughtful.  it was not an easy process to arrange for our son's cremation, but Lauri made it so much easier, informing me of the current status of each step on the way.  I highly recommend Monticito Memorial Park to anyone facing the death of a loved one.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I chose Montecito because I had attended a going home service there for another family member and felt it to be nice, well kept and peaceful. Hidden away in a nice location. Much more than I expected. Everything went very smoothly. Lauri and Anthony were so attentive and never to hard to talk too or contact. Everyone very pleasant and just a good vibe in working with everyone. The package we chose for our son was so beautiful and well put together everything I could possibly think of was included. I would definitely recommend Montecito Memorial. They took care of everything and I was very pleased with the outcome. Thank you so much Montecito for your unfailing attention to our needs and helping us get through this very tragic time in our lives. God Bless you.<//Review><Time>1575820452011</Time>< user_name>

Everyone was so helpful from start to finish. Our questions were answered in a timely manner. They all treated us with respect and were gentle with us given the situation. My dad’s services turned out better than I had expected. The only thing I would suggest is they give you a checklist of what needs to be done and turned in, after losing a loved one your mind can be foggy.<//text>

Just went out to visit my parents and brother’s grave on memorial day today and I couldn’t get one of the flower vases out of the ground so I called the office. They’re closed and the ground keepers aren’t there today. I said are you kidding, on memorial day? Also, the grass is all dying in the cemetery and they aren’t taking care of the plaques. Plaques are getting buried with dirt.</Review>

I give this place a rating of 5 stars. I did not handle my sister's funeral arrangements but I must say, the staff was just so caring and professional. They made a slide show of my sister and it came out so beautiful. That's cause my sister was beautiful. I would recommend this place to anyone living in the Colton, CA area. It is handicap accessible. I wish I would have taken pictures of the place but I didn't.</Review>

Things have been tough with losing someone we really love. The workers at montecito made things easier for my family and myself with services and a personal viewing. The reason for all five stars is because they really made us feel welcomed and they showed compassion from the get go. I would highly recommend.< /Review>

Montecito is stunning beautiful and well kept.  I been coming here since I was a young kid to visit my family members. Since 1976 Montecito has been our place to put to rest our love ones.  My dad got sick so we purchase land Deanna was wonderful pleasant and kind.  When he died a few days later I had to make final arrangements. Deciding and making arrangements were made quickly with no pressure from the staff. I thought wow this is great, they are going to take care of my dad.   I am on my way to dads memorial service,  I get a call stating his oil paintingPortrait did not arrive.  they said they are sorry but it’s not their fault. I was so upset I had to pick  up a cheap frame and put a picture in it. I only  had 5x7. Next thing the sheet where the urn sits was wrinkled. Come on guys!  I had five  flower deliveries from family.  Only one was in the chapel. Please be careful Monceito has two addresses. So the flowers went to the wrong location however they were on Monceito property. When my in-laws called the manager he said that’s not their fault. Ok here’s a tip if there’s a delivery find out where it goes and take it there! Four arrangements were not in the chapel because when they made it to my location the service had already begun!  My three concerns were major and heart breaking to a daughter grieving.  Please check on everything don’t assume it’s all being taken of.  The services were on a Friday, I send a email Friday night because I was upset. On Monday the manager called she was wonderful and understood.  I needed to be heard. I am leaving this review to help other families ask the right questions.  Please check and make make sure everything is done, please don’t assume. I made a mistake by trusting others.  It’s a beautiful place. I am updating my review my mother passed away on Monday, 6 1/2 months after my dad. I been working with Ernie and he is wonderful. I told the team that I was concerned by my last experience with them. He ensure me he will be in touch and keep me updated and check on the photo and the other stuff as well.  Osbelia is very kind and nice as well. I will keep you posted as the date gets closer. As of now I feel confident the services will be celebration of my moms life. I added a star hopefully after Saturday’s I can give them 5 stars.  Today once again their team came though for me and my family they manage to put my step dad and mom together in the candle light video. I lost both of them this year, this made me happy and smile . Thank you Ernie and your team! Today my mom services were perfect! Thank you !Please thank your team again. I would recommend your service to my family and friends.  Unfortunately I had to deal with Monceito again September 2020, I lost my brother. They did a wonderful job with my  mom.  I lost my brother, and now my sister in law is getting the run around.  We are really hurt he is without his marker, it been paid for since Sep. But it’s so hard to get in touch with anybody.  The follow though is horrible.  So two bad experiences out of three .  I am very disappointed and hurt. I change my review to 1 star for one job done correctly .update - March 12 still no marker . I will keep my review updated .< /review>

My mother prepaid much of her burial expenses.  What she did not rearrange was the flowers, coffin, body handling and the actual service.  The office staff was very helpful, HOWEVER (and this is a BIG however) the pastor that was provided ruined the entire service.

This pastor called me in advance and we discussed what I would like said and the facts and particulars of my mother's life and personality at length.  He then told me that he would write up what he would say and meet me and my siblings an hour before the service to go over what he was going to say.  After our conversation I felt comfortable that there was no need to ask anyone else to speak.  He was also texted additional information about my mother's career.  Instead of meeting us as agreed he showed up 10 minutes before the service saying he was stuck in traffic and told us not to worry. Imagine how disappointing it was when he said nothing that we had discussed and his generic description did not fit my mother AT ALL!  He obviously had not prepared and actually picked up his cell phone during the service as if he were going to read from the text at that time!

There is no second chance with a funeral and my mother deserved so much better.  This man's lack of professionalism or concern is inexcusable!< /review>

This cemetary is beautiful but with beauty comes a price for those families on a budget you can have your service at other funeral homes that offer a lot more for less money and then lay your love one to rest at montecino.< /Text>

I see it on the way to the hosptal and I love seeing the pretty flowers and the plaqes of the people who died. Highly recommend for good service, caring staff, and gorguse scenery.< /text>

<text>treated our Fire Chief like dirt while going through the burial of his mother. I can vouch for this person spending multiple days of his life defending the homes from fire in the hills near and in Colton, CA. To be treated like he was is shameful. If fire is ever approaching your business, You all have nothing to worry about. We have something you don't. Integrity, Sense of Duty and Honor. There is somethings we can't control though, like Karma.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>We didnt take into consideration that there gates for visitors is only from 8am to 6pm which is hard for me to accept. I'd like to go visit my father at any time of the day or night. It feels like I have to sneak in if it's before or passed 6pm just to go sit with my wonderful father. It's a major dissapointment personally.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dcac65319c9789:0x1198d5135608576a< /Gmap_id>< username>

<text>The swim beach was nice, the sand keeps the water clear and beautiful. It was sad to see that people don't pick up after themselves when there are dumpers everywhere. There was trash in places piled up and along the shore line. But overall it is a beautiful lake, with warm water.< /text>< Time>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>The lake here is great. However after camping here for several nights I can safely say we won't be camping here again. This campground was definitely a party area. Which is fine, if that's what you're looking for. If you want to enjoy nature and are looking for a peaceful place to enjoy a relaxing evening under the stars, this ain't it. Every night we were here there were multiple sites  blaring a variety of music until about 2:30AM. When we mentioned it to the park rangers we were told to call 911 when it happens and report it, or we could move campsites. Drinking is usually accompanied with loud music at all hours and it shows. Beer bottles, cans, and other liquor containers are strewn up and down the streets in the morning. And the bathroom had vomit all over toilets and floors in the restrooms. I know this isn't the fault of the park rangers or people running the camp ground and it's really disappointing to see people treat a public area with such disrespect. However, if they enforced their rules, which you have to agree to when reserving a camp space, I can't help but feel like some of this wouldn't happen.<//Review>< Pics>

Life saver during the pandemic.. Spacious enough to take a walk with privacy.. Especially during the week. Currently, spring time, volume of visitors had risen.  I still love Perris Lake!  Thinking of taking up fishing as a new hobby😎🌊<//review>

First time going here, I thought it was pretty cool, water was nice and warm, the further you go out it gets a little colder but overall great experience. You can use floaties for the kids but you have to use the life vest I believe but overall people are really social able, lots of hi and bye 😊❤< /Text>

It was awesome going to Lake Perris. It is a big Lake. The place is huge, with its camping grounds, and different hiking/biking trails. No Dogs in the water, but you can take them on the campgrounds.

We took our boat, and it was great, with 3 huge launching ramps, it was hassle free. Going back around the 21st of May, for my wife's birthday, and camp there over night.

And it's secure, Sheriffs make there presence known, by their constant patroling and safety checks.

It was a great family time, that is why we will be going back in 3 weeks.</Text>

<review>The lake is absolutely beautiful! There are campgrounds, bike paths, a beach, and an island with limited picnic sites for a truly special experience. You can take your boat, kayak or other water toys. You can also fish on the lake or along the shore. Lake Perris is a hidden treasure!<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8ATCtCwiykQA4cbbOP1fHz5m8R8WPmyrY6tPR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMk4sIHd9xhMwB8FKLLMljhgD919DgMZBcIWe12=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO978ImL_0riy1bfjirUqhet41VA8u702fkuoCA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0x1YtX3LQqiOwQiE--5TKMGjv4d77qSUF_N1n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBbsapBBDVgYagtCyaPgVUjWNqGaJgvyPayBx4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

The lake is very beautiful and I love the area, but the workers noticed we were Hispanic and quickly began making up excuses not to let us in, talking about wanting to “protect” the lake and whatnot, yet a ton of them weren’t even wearing masks. Very discriminatory, don’t think I could come here again.<//review>

<Review>Peaceful parks and nice wooden benches where you can have a picnic with your loved ones. Big lake where you can ride boats in and fish. Great atmosphere for a bbq with really good scenery.
You can swim here and camp as well.
Only costs 10$ for a day pass<//Review><username>David Cabrera< /username><gmap_id>0x80dca0ab76284ae5:0x532c29a35fd7649e</gmap_id>< Time>

The swim beach was nice, the sand keeps the water clear and beautiful. It was sad to see that people don't pick up after themselves when there are dumpers everywhere. There was trash in places piled up and along the shore line. But overall it is a beautiful lake, with warm water.< /Review>

<Text>The lake here is great. However after camping here for several nights I can safely say we won't be camping here again. This campground was definitely a party area. Which is fine, if that's what you're looking for. If you want to enjoy nature and are looking for a peaceful place to enjoy a relaxing evening under the stars, this ain't it. Every night we were here there were multiple sites  blaring a variety of music until about 2:30AM. When we mentioned it to the park rangers we were told to call 911 when it happens and report it, or we could move campsites. Drinking is usually accompanied with loud music at all hours and it shows. Beer bottles, cans, and other liquor containers are strewn up and down the streets in the morning. And the bathroom had vomit all over toilets and floors in the restrooms. I know this isn't the fault of the park rangers or people running the camp ground and it's really disappointing to see people treat a public area with such disrespect. However, if they enforced their rules, which you have to agree to when reserving a camp space, I can't help but feel like some of this wouldn't happen.<//Text>< Rating>

<Review>First time going here, I thought it was pretty cool, water was nice and warm, the further you go out it gets a little colder but overall great experience. You can use floaties for the kids but you have to use the life vest I believe but overall people are really social able, lots of hi and bye 😊❤</Review>< Resp>

The lake is very beautiful & the water is great. But there was so much trash by the lake & the bathrooms were horrible. But the place is beautiful. For people seeing my review & if you go & see the same issue. Help by rating 1 star in the reviews & maybe with the more low reviews they see the more they will reinforce people to clean. The lake water is very clean compared to other lakes I’ve seen. It’ll be devastating to see Lake Perris become a complete dump by disrespectful visitors. Us as humans already ruin so much beautiful nature areas with all of our greedy “needs” & we already affected this world as much as it is. Let’s help by taking care of places that are still existing to us today. Before we end up with nothing !</text>

First time ever to Lake Perris and my family and I had a blast. Went with some friends with kids the same age and the kids. It was nice watching the kids playing and enjoying them selves. It was perfect for these times because there was no one else there. Met some really nice people later on in the day but still being safe. The water was warm even though it wasn't terribly hot. The scenery is what really grabbed my attention. Definitely going to go back.</text>

Loved it! Great outdoors place for the family. You can walk, hike trails, ride bikes, sail a boat, fly kite, fish etc. And it's actually pretty huge and has working bathrooms. Me and my family really enjoyed ourselves. Would definitely recommend! My only issue was the water was pretty dirty but I only dipped my feet in anyway so it was all good. I feel like my pictures aren't doing it justice because it was actually pretty beautiful. And for it being so close to home and only $10 parking all day and you can come and go with your receipt, it was awesome!< /text>

<review>It was awesome going to Lake Perris. It is a big Lake. The place is huge, with its camping grounds, and different hiking/biking trails. No Dogs in the water, but you can take them on the campgrounds.

We took our boat, and it was great, with 3 huge launching ramps, it was hassle free. Going back around the 21st of May, for my wife's birthday, and camp there over night.

And it's secure, Sheriffs make there presence known, by their constant patroling and safety checks.

It was a great family time, that is why we will be going back in 3 weeks.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80dca0ab76284ae5:0x532c29a35fd7649e<//Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Went for a day of fishing. Didn't catch anything. Kind of windy but then that's why they call it fishing and not catching. The place is gorgeous the bathrooms are well kept clean. Fantastic swimming area for the family and the kids.

Omg I love it here . Today I went for the first time and what can I say.. Beautiful!! Goodbye dirty beaches. I mean people will be people and there was some liter here and there as expected, but nothing like most of beaches I've been to in Cali.  It was a nice experience, so I'm already planning my next trip back.</review>

Loved it! Great outdoors place for the family. You can walk, hike trails, ride bikes, sail a boat, fly kite, fish etc. And it's actually pretty huge and has working bathrooms. Me and my family really enjoyed ourselves. Would definitely recommend! My only issue was the water was pretty dirty but I only dipped my feet in anyway so it was all good. I feel like my pictures aren't doing it justice because it was actually pretty beautiful. And for it being so close to home and only $10 parking all day and you can come and go with your receipt, it was awesome!</review>

<text>Ithis is my personal opinion I don't go as often as others but it's a ok place to spend a family day I just wish everyone will pick up their trash.
I was there today and the restrooms are so dirty with all the money they make I'm sure is more than enough to pay some one clean them,and I'm not talking about trash they look like they haven't been scruyfor months.<//text><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

Warning of snakes. We saw a rattle snake. Luckily it was away from our campsite and kinda doing his own thing. Make sure you watch your steps, especially at nights and stay away from them if spotted.</Review>

We enjoyed swimming in the lake with a beautiful view of the mountains in the backdrop. It wasn't crowded at this time of year. There were lots of areas with picnic tables and shade near the lake. We went hiking and could see everything in just about a 30 minute walk to the top of the trail we went on.< /Review>< Name>

<text>First time ever to Lake Perris and my family and I had a blast. Went with some friends with kids the same age and the kids. It was nice watching the kids playing and enjoying them selves. It was perfect for these times because there was no one else there. Met some really nice people later on in the day but still being safe. The water was warm even though it wasn't terribly hot. The scenery is what really grabbed my attention. Definitely going to go back.< /text>< gmapID>

<username>Jason Ax</username><pictures>None< /pictures><Review>This start park is extremely run down, warn and dated. The roads are a mess and all parking lots need re paving. The trail around the lake is nice except for across the dam as it is cracked and uneven. All of the rest points around the lake are vandalized, or damaged and there is trash everywhere. Half of the common areas are dirt where grass used to be and the grass areas are mostly weeds.  It needs A LOT of work.   Trees are over grown, bushes and weeds are out of control and there are no more boat docks. The people who go there do not respect the park and leave it a mess. It's sad to see such an amazing place look so bad.<//Review></record>

Love it here. It's always so clean and the walking trails and views are just what I need to unwind and get a bit of exercise. I wish they had affordable, year round passes just for walkers who want to go in the park for just an hours walk.<//Review>

People do not observe quiet time at loud music and no Rangers around due to being overwhelmed with entries into park. RV site is a parking lot and they let tent camping into RV spots. So, pick your own situation.<//Review>

Always a great place to take the family for a swim and picnic day at the lake.  It's too bad many of the visitors don't pick up after themselves, lots of debris and trash near the picnic areas.</review>

What a wonderful place to go for a walk, bike ride, rock climbing, and bird watching. So many ways to recreate are packed into this beautiful state park. The entrance fee is only $10! Free if you have a state park pass. I look forward to returning to Lake Perris State Recreation Area in the near future.<//Text>

I love it. A lovely get away close to home. Camping, fishing, boating, hiking, and biking are just a few of the activities possible. I came at the invitation of the city to participate in an organized ride around the lake. The facilities are top notch. The $10 entry fee is well worth the experience. I have fished the lake in the past and I didn't realize the other activities possible. Definitely coming back for a campout.<//Review>

<Text>If you come here in the middle of the week in winter, it's practically deserted.  Be prepared with bug repellent or a face net because there are nats everywhere.  There is plenty of picnic tables and grills to use.  The grounds are kept pretty clean.<//Text><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<review>Awesome! Paved trail goes all the way around the lake . Beautiful views, lots to do. Camping, fishing, biking, hiking, rock climbers , horse back riding , sand beach line.   Plenty of benches and picnic tables in shaded areas. Bathrooms throughout trail. 10+ total miles around.< /review><name>Shekinah Fero</name>< gmap_id>

It has a long beach front fairly shaded with trees. Beach and boat launch run 1.5 miles. There are 8 parking sections total but 2 are closed. The far parking section 8 leads to a beach section with a large grassy area.  All the sections have clean restroom stalls and outdoor showers. They are all open and working. The entrance fee for day use is 10 dollars. Boats may be more. There are no concessions nor food stands at all. The park has ample shade trees all up and down the beach. It is a good park for a day outing on a hot day. I can't comment on boating on the lake as I don't boat. They should have paddle board and kayak rentals places but I don't see anything like that there.< /Text>

I really enjoyed this place. This place is really really hot though so make sure to bring Sandle and sunscreen. To enter you have to pay(I have to pay 10$/it was on Sunday) and there a lot of people's. There are area where you and park / plots 1-12. There some restrooms and tables where you can eat. There  some playground where children and little kid can play. My family and I really enjoyed it.</review>

Stayed two days and one night. Camp sites are a good value, nice firepit with grill attached. Park Rangers can be a little testy.  Checking in takes some time. Lake is great early in the morning and warm enough that the kids aren't cold but it's still refreshing. Weekends are super busy. Recommend you arrive early even if you're just going to be there for the day. The park fills up quickly.</text>

The inspection time to get in with watercraft took forever. We had way more fun coming in the middle of the week vs a crowded weekend. Would be nice if people would pick up after themselves, lots of loose trash, especially on the island. Rest of facilities were well maintained.< /Text>

<Review>Beautiful place to go on any day of the week. Clean restrooms. Plenty of benches and small grills. I wish there was more green grass and larger trees to for bigger shade area. Great for workouts, dates, family picnics. Dogs welcomed here as well. Parking is $10 for all day.< /Review><user>100630840597497932636<//user>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Lake Perris offers boating, day use facilities with beach access for swimming or relaxing, overnight camping, and trails for hiking, biking or horse riding.
The paved muli-use trail around the lake is nearly 9 miles and excellent for biking. This is a moderate trail.< /Review>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>This campground has everything you need for glamping. The grounds are mostly clean from trash but unfortunately the beaches are not.  Shore fishing is extremely difficult because people with jefskis will come buzzing along so close to the shore and scare away the fish.  The campgrounds are close together so you don't get much privacy and some people do not respect the 10pm quiet hours and will blast (and I mean blast) their music until 2 in the morning.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>Absolutely love coming here. They have so much to do. You can hike, camp, fish, boat, sail and swim. There is so many possibilities for all levels of outdoors people. You can take it easy lake side with a picnic or go canoeing and do some bass fishing. We can't wait for the lake to be all the way full and the fish population to come back. This will be one of the best fishing locations in a couple years.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAVrsEgSh7wxCS1Vdb8qxFJtXnV_3v9Suq__iL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJuNWevuK6Ljt1mcIO0hmJdTb6a7eLW8Am_BQV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dca0ab76284ae5:0x532c29a35fd7649e<//GmapID></record>

Beautiful lake with both a beach area, sailing/boating area, and hiking grounds. Only minus was that I did notice a lot of trash while I was hiking and around the beach but other than that a nice little treasure from mother nature.<//Text>

<review>We had such a great time! There was hardly anyone there on a Wednesday morning. The water temperature was perfect. We went from 9:30am-12:00pm and it wasn't too bad at all. Granted we had an easy up and it just made everything perfect. The kids were comfortable swimming without floaties cause they didn't have to worry about it being too deep or waves. Will def.

This lake has many nice views from the mountains to the lake and a view into the city if your into that. The water looks clean from a distance but I havent gone close enough to see how clean the lake is since I mainly go for biking. There is a nice asphalt trail that circles all around the lake and you can even ride on the dam, as well as walk or run. My only gripe is some of the tables along the asphalt trail are poorly taken care of with grass taking over the table which causes some stops to be infested with flying bugs but most of them are fine. Overall it's a nice lake and it's worth a visit if you want to ride a bike, walk, run, ride a horse, or even use boats, jet skies, or canoes to use in the lake.<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Boats, jet skis, fishing, hiking, picnicking. A bunch of opportunity for family fun. Bring $10 to get in and $10 extra for brining a JetSki or boat. One of the best low cost ways to have fun on the inland empire. Warm water. Plenty of space to picnic!< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoMQEnQGPeZ_nAiFyYZLwTBmJJdP0NrCtvj6F2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFbEbFgrhXyjGjCK75XTt9rlGjh4AnCyOcAVAm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoZdQlMcs8XIN6G8VTUI1UfA65FGKYqPl6q7uI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPA5vLktUWkUMfNZScPl9kKJatETV9pJFH0ZIvl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMl8V51PZ5u--pFbLH6OTm0CzZsfEfwGsKLjjsD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

The place is surrounded by nature, grass fields, beach sand and animals like squirtles and seagles. You have picnic areas, bbq grillers areas even a camping area. If you like fishing there is a part you can do it but honestly i never tried. Strongly recommended for families and people who like quiet places. The fee (without a boat) is only 10 usd.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dca0ab76284ae5:0x532c29a35fd7649e</Gmap_id></record>

Beautiful state park. It cost $8 or $10 to park. You can camp, fish, boat, hike, even ride horses. There are places to shower, full toilet and even a convenient store that sells bait. Park rangers, DFG, and police all have stations there. 50mph on water I believe. 2 sand beaches for swimming. Dogs are welcome.<//Text>

I ride my horse here almost weekly. I enjoy kayaking here. I want to start biking here. Everyone is so polite. Only 4 stars because the bathroom at Hunter's parking lot is not maintained very well. It's gross.< /Text>

Boating, fishing, and water play will keep the family busy all day.  Flushed restroom is clean.
Bring shades because it can hot.  Also bring a wagon for beach gear as there is a bit of walking from the parking lot.</Review>

There was a SOCAL MTB race here and it was a ton of fun! You can go swimming in the lake, ride your bike around the lake, or even go on some MTB trails near the park. This lake is very well maintained, barely any trash anywhere. You can also BBQ here too.</Text>

<Review>Loved the view and we had hook up. Too close to your neighbors. This lake is a party place. Music blaring, people fighting, drunk, cops came. Check in is at 2pm and they stop renting boats at 3pm. So you have to go the next morning at 6am or you won't get one. Won't be coming back.<//Review>< Response>

Beautiful place, but the sand is very dirty. So many beer bottle caps, broken glass and random plastic. Not safe for kids.</text>

We had an awesome weekend here camping/seadooing/waterskiing. The water level was higher than I've seen in a long time. The only issue I have, are the reeds that they allow to continue to take over around the island and other areas. Outside of that, its a great place for an enjoyable day/weekend.<//Text>

I enjoyed my visit to the lake had a blast. People had bad reviews about this place because it used to be dirty and there was  trash in the lake and around the lake. The restroom can be more clean but other than that I liked it</text>

<Text>Beautiful park with tons of wildlife and a clear water lake with a large beach area. The local marina has very reasonable deals for rentals.

Stayed two days and one night. Camp sites are a good value, nice firepit with grill attached. Park Rangers can be a little testy.  Checking in takes some time. Lake is great early in the morning and warm enough that the kids aren't cold but it's still refreshing. Weekends are super busy. Recommend you arrive early even if you're just going to be there for the day. The park fills up quickly.</Text>

<Review>I liked each spot to camp had a water spicket and restrooms close by. Campgrounds are very clean when we went and the only issue I had was with check in. I didn't know that even though you made a reservation you still have to check in and register your vehicle before you go into the campgrounds. Granted, supposedly there were signs but a lot of people got confused and had to reform into the long check-in line. It got bottlenecked at that point because of so many people trying to check in at once, but overall we really enjoyed the spot.</Review>< pics>

We had a really great time. My kids really enjoyed themselves in the water, its lake water so you have to be mindful of that, but fun. Only thing a bit annoying was entering and exiting campground. Must have patience because it can be a bit of a wait.</text>

Love it! Was only $10 for a day pass and well worth it to fund this gorgeous park. Plenty of parking and picnic areas all with great views. There are restrooms throughout and saw park patrol on regular loops, so it felt safe and accessible.<//text>

Beautiful and calm evening at the lake. I love fishing here. Good price for camping as well.<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>We came to the lake for a field visit with grandpa and the dog. According to Google, the place was expected to be crowded - given the time of the year and historical trends. I am glad the flow was incorrect, as the lake was empty and the grounds incredibly clean. We could take the dog for a long hike, and she had a blast playing fetch by herself. Throughout our few hours there, we only saw a couple of other visitors, which is strange given the place is marvelous, and there are plenty of nearby municipalities. This is a location I would recommend during weekdays because of its laud public, yet we were lucky to find a weekend that was too cold for other people. There are portable throughout the hikes and a few benches for the elders to sit. Some decent picture-spot for birds are also along the pathway. Although comprehensive because of the weather, we saw minimal wildlife around - other than a few ducks on the lake. Around the ducks, there were fishermen with short-throw rods. Strangely, many of the different parking zones were closed, thus some combined flow was created. On a second note, it would be nice to have some snack machines for people who forgot to bring their food. There are large, permanent toilets nearby the docking station, but they lacked a functioning hand dryer and some soap.< /Text>< Resp>

Love it! Was only $10 for a day pass and well worth it to fund this gorgeous park. Plenty of parking and picnic areas all with great views. There are restrooms throughout and saw park patrol on regular loops, so it felt safe and accessible.< /Text>

Only a handful of people there today (January 10).  A Beautiful California State Park :)  $10 entry for the day.  Magical when there is nobody there...  I walked my dog and took photos.  It was an amazing day!< /review>

< Review>
Upon visiting Lake Perris during the pandemic I was surprised at how unchanged the experience was. It was wonderful being able to go down to the beach and swim. I do not see signage for requirements of masks. Everyone was mindful of social distancing and it was not crowded on Thursday which made social distancing easy.<//Review>

It was nice there, but keep food in a truck/dry locker or cooler because at about 3:00 in the morning there was something that some coyotes killed, also there was a racoon that raided our trash<//review>

Beautiful lake and a great place to take the family. Boat rentals are cheap and are a must if you want to experience the full lake. Great fishing.</review>

Perfect if you want to be near a beach without going to the actual beach. There's lots of parking and the lake is clean, good facilities for cookouts and just chilling with friends and family. Parking is 10 dollars for the day.< /text>

< Review>
I used to come here as a kid🥰 I'm glad to see it cleaned up a little bit but they could use a few more trash cans on the beaches. And maybe somebody to pick up the trash that others leave behind. Other than that, Epstein didn't kill himself.< /Review>

I mean the water look like they took it out clean it and put it back. I also like bike trail. Well the area where guys fish on the side on the rocks, that road could be a whole lot better but still like it.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

The inspection time to get in with watercraft took forever. We had way more fun coming in the middle of the week vs a crowded weekend. Would be nice if people would pick up after themselves, lots of loose trash, especially on the island. Rest of facilities were well maintained.< /Review>

<Review>There was a SOCAL MTB race here and it was a ton of fun! You can go swimming in the lake, ride your bike around the lake, or even go on some MTB trails near the park. This lake is very well maintained, barely any trash anywhere. You can also BBQ here too.< /Review>< date>

<Text>After a nice stroll through the park. I can tell the rangers do a good job maintaining the place. Although It can be messy at times (which isn't the rangers fault) it is still a beaitiful site for those who want a good grasp for nature.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><user>100556301006337165543</user>< Time>

Always a good place to get away from the Heat play in the water and relax spend time with friends and family on and off the water we were just there last weekend for the very first Lake Perris Music Festival they said they're going to do any Ali pretty cool event bands play all night long for 3 days arts and crafts during the day< /text>

This is a bit of a hidden gem. Sure, all of the locals know it and recreate there but for the rest of us... Wow. You can book banning sites on the weekend just a free weeks in advance. It's easy to get to from most of socal. Saturdays are a bit wild because there are soooo many people. We'll hit it up on another weekday for sure. Be warned: it's hot. We were prepared but still beat by the heat for about two hours daily.< /Text>

<Text>Entrance fee was just $10 flat when I visited. Various lots depending on what activity you want to do. Plenty of shaded areas for a picnic and just a short walk to the water. Would definitely come back again<//Text>< rating>

It's a cool place to sit on the beach and swim but boating here is dangerous.  They let way to many people on the lake. Most of which are  people on personal  watercraft  that have absolutely no idea what they are doing.  I had my boat hit on the trailer on the launch  ramp by a sea doo and once again while it was anchored  on the beach.</Text>

Perris is definitely one of the more managed and upkept state parks. Made me recent camping trip there safe and enjoyable.</review>

It's surprisingly VERY NICE and the lake is much bigger than I remember from 20 yrs ago. Lake water seems very CLEAN.  The RV camping allows for gray water but since there is NO black water dumping, RVing is a challenge. If you love bees/wasps, this place is for you.  In closing, I will come back but I will NEVER come back here on Friday or Saturday ever again. Too damn crowded.  The park staff and State Police are AWESOME !!!!!</Text>

In the midst of rapidly rising Vivid 19, you'd think people would be conscientious. Hundreds of people, squeezed onto the beaches, practically on top of each other, and no one was wearing a mask. Riverside county, get ready for another explosion of Vivid.<//Review>

I have camped at Lake Perris twice. I highly recommend visiting even for a day trip. Camping reservations are easily done online. The CA State Ranger said weekend camping fills up during the peak summer months. I stayed midweek in June without an issue.

Camping in April was good & bad. The good is better weather (low 80's) and few people. The bad was more insects. A swarm of gnats plagued us. I don't remember any bug problems in June, just hotter temperatures (90's).

The lake is great. The water was a little chilly in April but my family still got in the water. The water was a perfect cool temperature in June.

There are built bathrooms at both the lake and can't ground. There are free showers in the campground bathrooms. Bring your own soap. There are water facets near the camping roads to do dishes and such. I always being water to drink. There are fire pits at each campsite.</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Our family loved the lake and camping areas. They were both so much fun. It was nice to be able to camp with clean bathrooms and showers with warm water readily available as needed. It was probably due to inexperience, but no one in our group was able to catch any fish the 4-6 times out trying in many different spots.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNh8E4kHfifDmyGOndNueFqqzREnG_rwkzNywTp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBQ2NvLljWwwmOka9YXkHeIcAquvC6jomeZih1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUzynWlvIGj0lPWwPP9tRs8SiGkj2JcfkjFJem=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM075tlg6H2IZYWmXMDucfPnk7lPP65VhOOuG5_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

Beautiful state park. It cost $8 or $10 to park. You can camp, fish, boat, hike, even ride horses. There are places to shower, full toilet and even a convenient store that sells bait. Park rangers, DFG, and police all have stations there. 50mph on water I believe. 2 sand beaches for swimming. Dogs are welcome.<//review>

Camping was nice but today  left my umbrella  on the beach with My blanket and someone stole  it  ,  now I understand why everything In Walmart  in perris is locked up , camping was great though  left  Stuff out and nothing disappeared   bathrooms  were very pleasant and clean , staff was  helpful and sweet ,  it's not as ghetto  at the camp grounds as it is down by the lake .< /Text>

< Review>
First lake I had ever been to. Went a month ago, June 4. It was beautiful and luckily it was not packed at the time 😍 so far I've been there 5 times because I live near 😂 my daughter who is almost 3 is almost swimming because of those 5 trips ❤

but yes it has been getting more crowded so i have not been back for a week since cases are rising again and I like to keep distances.

Please if you plan to come, bring a trash bag for your trash(they have dumpsters not too far but still a bag makes it easier to gather your trash after your done snacking and then just toss that into the big dumpster)

Bring a mask. SPF to protect skin. Be safe.< /Review>

Shoreline could of used some cleaning and  I was unable to see the in the water at all because it was green but like I said cleaner than I have seen before. When entering in the gate credit card machine was down so we had to drive to the other gate which was no problem.

<Text>I love Lake Perris. It's always very peaceful and relaxing. I'm not sure if these are Mountain Lion or bobcat prints, but they were a good size. Felines don't leave claw marks cause they're claws are retractacable.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>Very unorganized, expect to wait possibly up to an hour if not longer in line to even get in. Free for all in the parking lot. Hardly any clean up of fallen trees and debris in the island and  surrounding rest areas. Run down and under staffed. It's a shame oh, so much potential</text>< user_name>

Very nice State of California campground, park and lake.  The campground is nice with a lot of spots both dry camping and with hookups but lack sewer hookups.  They have several ADA spots that are available for service connected Veterans and Veterans also get free day use, camp spots and lake use after they apply for their Veterans application with the state.  My overall grade is a B, and only due to shallow camp spots and curbing that limits larger campers and makes it difficult to get in and out of their campground spots.</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Beautiful Family Trip!

I took my husband for his birthday after researching the area and the locals 🐍 We fell in love with the lake and the hills. We found granite spiney lizards along with hummingbird moths, bunnies, and more. It was fun physical activity and spending some time in the water together was so relaxing.

We loved it so much that we brought our sons out 2 weeks later and they loved it as well. I'm In the future we'll be sure to camp and/or barbeque as it is allowed in designated areas. There is also boating, fishing, picnic areas, and a couple of playgrounds for kids. I highly recommend bringing your family. There is so much life here and the staff including the local sheriffs were all very polite and helpful. We will be back for more family adventures.</text>< Pics>

<text>I loved getting away for a day here there is a $10 entry fee so bring some cash it's worth it. This was my first time and there's so many different parking areas with access to the lake you can drive further down to be around less people. Probably wanna make sure you bring food and drinks cuz there's nothing available to purchase close by. But they do have benches, grass areas with trees for shade, bathrooms, and a nice area by the water with a thicker sand. I believe the parks for kids was still closed. And just a little tip it's a good idea to bring a sun hat cuz the water feels so good you wanna be in it the entire time but the sun is so strong I was lucky to have a nice big sun 👒 hat. They also have camping areas there I wanna camp there soon ❤. There are some 🐟 fishes that occasionally swim close by the shore but its honestly cool to see so close I was nervous at first but you get over it 😂. All in all it was a great time i highly recommend it<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

In the past Lake perris was known for a not so clean recreational Campground/lake. The water was drained,so repairs could be done on the Dam,and it also helped create more plants/trees for fish to hide around,and take our lures. I only started going back last year. Since last april they have added more water,and is very close to its 100% capacity,the Restrooms,water,beaches,and camp areas are cleaner and clearer. weekdays are great to go fishing,BBQ, or anything you do there to have a good time. The weekdays are great if you want a nice quiet time,with friends,family,Both or even alone. There is ussuly 1-3 boats on the water. Now the weekends are different,and holidays. The marina still rents out boats that are kinda beat up,and the price is high per hour. The Lake now allows you fish from the dock. For a fee of course, $2 for kids $3 for adults. The price for park entry is $10 for the day,camping is separate price. The Lake also offers hiking and a paved trail that wraps around the lake for Bike riding,or running.the South end of the lake has a small area to picnic,camp and fish. At one time you could swim,but i would not recommend it. Only because people fish and it has alot more broken bushes that you can not see since the water level raised. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask me and i will answer as soon as i see them. I have been going to lake perris for over 20 years. I moved to moreno valley in 1985,moved away in 2003.<//review>

I used to come here often when I was a kid, and I returned during this past summer. I've been here more times than I've ever been to a beach, but it's a nice atmosphere. You can bring a big sheet to lay under a tree or use the picnic tables, make some lunch while there, and go for a swim. However, just be wary of your feet in the water because there are big rocks and seashells at the bottom. People bring their boats to cruise or their jet skis, and there is a playground for kids near the parking lot.</text>

I love this place so much. There are grills on the beach and dining areas and picnic tables. Tons of beach parking and spots. I still havent been to the museum or done much of the hiking there. Its so easy to pay 10 bucks for a while carload or family and then come have a great beach day. I know there are cool hiking trails and even a way to get on the island?!?! Basically, i should get a park pass because i really live being able to just go read books on the beach and $10 for a mini vacation?! Sign me up! It really is beautiful here.< /Text>

<text>Really nice area to camp, beautiful place, the 2 downsides are : some campers do not obey the quite time and go to sleep until 2am, and there is no ranger on campsite at that time, the other downside is in this Covid19 times there seems to be no sites restrictions as to campers in one site, on website it does mention 8 max in 1 campsite, but the campsite next to me where about 15 people in campsite.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dca0ab76284ae5:0x532c29a35fd7649e< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Lake Perris is good for fishing,  for bass, rainbow trout, catfish,  bluegill, black crappie, carp, and crayfish. It is easy accessible just lakking grasy and tree covered areas. Water sports are allowed and there is a beach area for swimming.<//text>

Brought our travel trailer and had a great time with the family. Ranger drives around and enforces 10pm noise ordinance. First time here since they filled the lake up. Water  was not bad like we had heard. The only issue I had is people not picking up after themselves, what can you do about that  and I also checked bathrooms which were a little dirty(late Sunday) . But overall a great place to camp, hike, fish, and swim that is close to home and cheap.<//review>

Clean beach.  Only downfall is the line in the morning to get in. Need to be there early or risk an hour wait.</Text>

Very nice lake, not far to travel to. Definitely would be better to get there early because the line takes about 45 mins to get into the lake. Once full they close the lake. Also the grills are by the beach lots 1-4 & 9-10 but they get taken fast. Better if you bring your own grill, chairs, and canopy for shade of you have it. Only $10 per car and the water is very refreshing with this hot weather<//Review>

<Review>Fantastic time fishing with the family! You can bring your boat, just make sure it is completely dry. Wash the boat a day or two beforehand, or just wait and wash it after the trip. Wait to put the ice in the cooler until after you have passed through inspection. Any signs of water will have your boat turned away.</Review>< rate>

Make sure you get there by 7am; there will be a long line to get in. I arrived at 10 and had to wait 50 minutes to get to the pay booth ( the park is worth the wait). It costs10 bucks to get in for a daily visit. If you have a boat, your wait will be longer because the state officials need to inspect your vessel for foreign entities on your boat surface.

I found lot 9 to be the cleanest and parking was accessible; make sure when you pick your tree to camp under the shade,  to place your belongings around the tree so no one will come later on and highjack your afternoon shade. Yes, people will actually do that, it happened to us. Lots 1,4,9 and 10 were the only beaches open on 7/18/2020. There will be about a 75 yard walk from your car to the sand,  but in my case, it was quite exhausting carrying out our stuff to and from the camp to the car.

Then there's the bathroom; the one close to us was terrible; the sewer line was backed up allowing a puddle of sewer water in the center of  both the men's and woman's. That problem was not fixed during our stay,  we had to walk to the next available restroom which was clean. You can grill carne asada, but make sure you toss your coal in the appropriate containers located close to the restrooms.

The water was breath taking, relaxing and refreshing considering I come from a 115 degree climate. As for Covid,  according to CDC rules for the county of Riverside,   you don't have to wear your mask unless you leave your camp and are closer than 6 feet from someone else. Unfortunately,  I only saw about 5 people wearing a mask outside their camp. No one was wearing a mask in the restroom; if anyone should be wearing a mask, it's in a bathroom right?

I will return to this lake, but only for a weekend stay, because it's not worth all the work for a daily stay. Anyways, I hope this helps and have fun.  Remember to be safe.<//review>

A nice little lakeside enclave right by Moreno Valley. It’s a state park, so you’ll pay parking and camping fees, but you’ll get your money’s worth.<//review>

I love that this has a running track and bike track i love going cause the park has a lot of trees. Though the water isn't all that especially in summer. Also the prices for locals should be less 10 for one day for locals is a lot wish it would be less like that i can be going more often., besides that every thing is nice< /Text>

Since they have re opened they are treating the customers very poorly and they are flooded with rangers going around harassing everyone. It's very unfortunate that they are behaving this way, I won't be going back with my boat until they treat people better around there and the rangers leave people alone.< /Text>

I love this place. But I don't like how they charge in the other side of the lake when it's nice and private it should be the free side but they called it the fee side. Why do we have to pay to enjoy swimming water.<//text>

Bird watching today 1-1-2020 was very fruitful, 1 Bald Eagle, Perigrine Falcon, Belted Kingfisher - Male,  a common lune, along with the more commonly seen osprey and pelicans. Awesome day! I Wish I had my photos from my camera to share.<//Text>

My home town ❤️ Love the Indian Exhibit ✨ Gate 11/12 is my favorite. Playgrounds in all gates. Fishing, Swimming, Hiking and Boating. Island in the middle of the lake to include restrooms. Friendly staff and great camping area. Close to grocery stores, eatery etc.<//review>

< Review>
First time here. The layout for the Group Camping needs improvement. There are no hookups for RV camping. There is not enough trees in the area. It is extremely hot in late September. Not enough parking for cars either.   There was no one around in the next group camping sites. We did not have any restrictions on how loud or how late we had our music on. Rangers kept a good eye on us during the night and day time.< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I love camping here. It is the only lake anywhere near San Diego that you are allowed to swim in! Also cheap to get day passes to fish and affordable boat and her ski rental. The spots don't fill up as fast as beaches on the ocean, but still need to book a camping spot 1 to 2 months in advance. Target the earlier and later summer months to avoid getting too much heat. Campground has flush toilets and showers<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Very nice lake, not far to travel to. Definitely would be better to get there early because the line takes about 45 mins to get into the lake. Once full they close the lake. Also the grills are by the beach lots 1-4 & 9-10 but they get taken fast. Better if you bring your own grill, chairs, and canopy for shade of you have it. Only $10 per car and the water is very refreshing with this hot weather<//Text>

Cal Fire was practicing water rescues in the swimming area, so there were people repelling and jumping out of helicopters. It was quite the show!</review>

It was such a nice day today , so I decided to go to Lake Perris. There was so few people there. So peaceful and quiet. I took a lunch with me and then did some walking. The area was clean. Some spots were closed to enter. I was told dogs are allowed but not near the sand area and then they have to remain on a leash. Would be nice to take the dog for a long walk there.
Price is $10 a day all day.</text>

This place is like an oasis in the desert. Quail loop 1-44 site number 4 (handicap placard required by anyone in the group) $30 per night, $10 per additional vehicle not legally towed. If you're bringing a boat PLEASE BRING IT SUPER DRY AND SUPER CLEAN! I can't stress that enough in case you get someone inspecting it who's as thorough as they're supposed to be, then you can't bring your boat in the lake. They might check your motor, carpet, fishing lures, even draining pipes for the slightest hint of moisture. Or you might get someone chill who just does a quick once over and passes you. Either way don't risk it and take a day to really clean and dry your boat so you don't lug it around for nothing. Don't put drinks or ice chest in your boat prior to inspection! There is a charge for boating like $8. So other than that enjoy the clean lake and beautiful views of mountains, the quails, coyotes, squirrels and road runners are fun to look at.< /text>

<time>1593787996607</time><Rating>1< /Rating><Review>For whatever reason, the staff at this lake are just terrible. Wait times for the gate in the morning are always long, the fee collection takes longer than DVL and other nearby lakes, and the boat inspectors are unnecessarily strict in their duties. I've had one ranger threaten to fail my inspection for "moisture around the drain of my cooler" and have had another inspector ask me to leave the boat as I was putting gear away while he was doing an inspection for a re-entry tag on my way out.

It's also a free for all for the jetskis and wake boats during the summer here. Damn dlshame because Perris is a fun lake to fish.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Really weird, they told us they were at capacity and wouldn’t allow us in. As we were turning around to drive back home, the 7-8 cars behind us were let in...🤔

Not sure how their selection process works for entry. Not coming back here ever again though.
Not recommended at all! Waste of a drive.<//text>< pictures>

Guards were helpful until they forgot to mention they way we came in would be closed after a certain time in the night and had to reroute an extra 3 miles around the campground to exit.</text>

< Review>
I love Lake Perris. There is swimming and sailing and boating and my favorite FISHING!!! They have a beach that is just for swimming and my kids love it!!! The fishing we haven't found what I would call a good spot yet but I have only fished from the shore and only a couple spots. Years ago I use to catch lots of fish. When they had the lake drained they built lots of spawning areas for the pan fish, bass and blue gills, they also created lots of catfish hiding/living areas. Should be excellent fishing real real soon!!!! Oh and they have camping!! Its awesome!! I love it!!<//Review>

Visited this park this past Sunday and was very glad we did. Very nice lake with marina. Boats are available to rent or launch your own. Nice campgrounds and picnic areas. Was very taken by the Indian museum. It was very informative. Not huge, but very well done and Jack was very knowledgeable. We really enjoyed our visit there.< /Review>

Place is nice and great views .. you can fish, seal renting a boat, enjoy the beach  or just have a rewarding walk enjoying the lake views ... some areas near the marina need upgrade. Cleaning and care... a place to visit and enjoy with family or alone</Text>

Entering was quite easy not as crowded as I expected. Plenty of free picknick areas. All grassy areas are now brown no grass left. Lake is nice water was warm restrooms were stocked and clean. Bring your own soap.<//text>

10 lots docking are off limits to swimming not the biggest lake but still great for a day in the sun
Jet skiing and boating fisherman also come for great catch the fish are pretty big here and plenty. The water is great perfect for summer much better then the beach!<//Review>

Camped here for 3 days. Hot showers on site, large fire pit to sit about 20 around, plenty of water faucets, large sit-down sitting areas. Great for group campers. Windy and dusty during sunset hours in late October.<//review>

I've been here many times with family and friends. It's great! Visiting the lake: Make sure you bring a shade tent and chairs because if you plan to sit next to the water there is absolutely no shade. Also it's a good 10 minute walk from the picnic tables to the water. It's almost impossible to wheel anything to the water because of the fine sand (coolers, strollers..etc). Camping: Very fun here! Spots are large. They have a lot of bathrooms that are well kept. Cart drives around selling firewood and ice in the evening. Lots of trees. It's a great spot to relax and be outdoors. Pet friendly! They have a 10pm silent time set and there is security that drives around enforcing rules. As always, no glass. I HIGHLY recommend this place!!<//Text>

<review>Awesome place all around. Camp site is wonderful for such an urban area. The beach is well designed and taken care of. Environment is pretty and fun but not very diverse or adventurous. Nothing exciting, not a Nat Park or anything. But for what it is, it's a great event venue as well as a solid place to camp or hang out for day use by the lake.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Amazing local gem with a beach like feel. Never overcrowded and always a great time. It's always clean and we feel safe. We bbq, play in the water and you can even take a ride your boats or seadoos in the water. There is also a place on site to rent some water toys. Parking is $10. Find q spot and enjoy.</Review>

A beach in my city! I don't have to drive an hour away! Fresh water so it doesn't sting our eyes. No waves so it's safer for my kids. Bring our life jackets and towels. Lot 8 kids playground and swim access. Plenty of parking and restrooms and BBQ areas. Yes shower/rinse areas.<//Text>

Love the place. 1st time camping here, & quite impressed. The facilities are SUPER CLEAN. Campgrounds are good size. Everyone is friendly, & the lake is the highest its been in 20 years.</Text>

<response>None</response><Text>It's a perfect getaway from the big city and it's located like 1hour and 25 min from Los Angeles. They have a lake to visit for the day and also camping grounds. They have two different campgrounds one for people who just want to camp with a tent and another for the RV and we stayed at the RV place without an RV and was 15 dollars more , 45 for RV section and 30 just for tents. But best part about the RV section it has electricity and water. You can come and go as you please the gates always open and staff and park rangers very helpful. It is a walk to the lake though. But the campground have benches, fire pits, restroom and shower. It's very clean too. They allow boats and jet skies on the lake too< /Text><gmap_id>0x80dca0ab76284ae5:0x532c29a35fd7649e<//gmap_id>< Date>

Good place to cool off during summer, 10 dollar entrance. They have camping sites but no hook ups for rvs or trailers, or showers. You can bring your watercraft as well. Overall inexpensive, and avoid all that traffic going to a nearby beach.</text>

I've been here twice my kids love it & so I do, it's a great place to swim & the water isn't cold like some other places that's number one point, You can get out & get back into the water within an hour happily because the water feels great, I'm in Costa Mesa 1:15min away from there, that's not to far.< /Review>

I've been here many times with family and friends. It's great! Visiting the lake: Make sure you bring a shade tent and chairs because if you plan to sit next to the water there is absolutely no shade. Also it's a good 10 minute walk from the picnic tables to the water. It's almost impossible to wheel anything to the water because of the fine sand (coolers, strollers..etc). Camping: Very fun here! Spots are large. They have a lot of bathrooms that are well kept. Cart drives around selling firewood and ice in the evening. Lots of trees. It's a great spot to relax and be outdoors. Pet friendly! They have a 10pm silent time set and there is security that drives around enforcing rules. As always, no glass. I HIGHLY recommend this place!!< /Review>

<text>It has a man made lake with water so clear you can see to the bottom. The sand area is more like ground rocks. There is a playground on the beach area. Several picnic tables on the beach area. The grounds also included a camp site, boating, fishing and walking trails. A lovely place for the entire family. Small children can enjoy the water with out worry because the lake is so smooth.
But to enter the area it will cost 10.00.< /text></record>

Amazing local gem with a beach like feel. Never overcrowded and always a great time. It's always clean and we feel safe. We bbq, play in the water and you can even take a ride your boats or seadoos in the water. There is also a place on site to rent some water toys. Parking is $10. Find q spot and enjoy.</Text>

< Review>
I've been here many times with family and friends. It's great! Visiting the lake: Make sure you bring a shade tent and chairs because if you plan to sit next to the water there is absolutely no shade. Also it's a good 10 minute walk from the picnic tables to the water. It's almost impossible to wheel anything to the water because of the fine sand (coolers, strollers..etc). Camping: Very fun here! Spots are large. They have a lot of bathrooms that are well kept. Cart drives around selling firewood and ice in the evening. Lots of trees. It's a great spot to relax and be outdoors. Pet friendly! They have a 10pm silent time set and there is security that drives around enforcing rules. As always, no glass. I HIGHLY recommend this place!!<//Review>

Just be advised that they do not allow any form of motorized vehicles for recreation, including electric bikes, electric Skateboardss or any other vehicles like them. We got kicked out by the park rangers. $10 entrance fee per parking wasn’t too bad until they kicked us out, obviously no refunds.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>Not exactly the rugged experience I associate with camping but it was a blast nonetheless. Your own water faucet and electricity box with outlets and your own parking area come along with your reservation which is a pleasant convenience. The bathrooms on site were clean and well taken care of as well. Will definitely be coming back.<//text>< pictures>

It's nearly the "parking lot" style camping experience at the "hook up" sites. Not completely, but close.
They have everything for the full hook ups except no 50amp (where I was parked) and no sewer drain at the drains in the camp site. Grey only. They do have the dump stations on the way out with all you'll need at the 3 position  dumps. The staff is about as friendly as anyone that doesn't want to talk and deals with their job, for the most part. I can only explain for the one guy that wasn't unpleasant, wasn't friendly bus was friendly, and wasn't pleasant..... He was just THERE.
It's a bit of a walk to the lake. Nothing serious, just through a small field, past the main 25MPH road that some people think it's a 55mph road and through the grass area through the picnic and..... WHEW! I'M TIRED JUST TYPING THE "HIKE"......and then down the sand. Good exercise, to say the least and not as far as I may come off!
$45/night? Naw! That's expensive for a place like this. We don't have the water toys though, so that may change your opinion of the price.
Campfire pits and picnic tables.
One site, a few from me tried to drain their grey with a drain completely clogged with dirt, small leaves and debris. I tried to help them unclog it but it was so deep of dirt, there was no luck getting to use it for the water. Not great maintenance.< /Review>

Nice place Very well protected. Very clean good showers nice and hot but u need to let water warm up. Restrooms well stocked with to and cleaned  daily. Plenty of things for the whole family to do. Camping spots are kept clean. You should bring your own fire wood or pay the rangers for wood. You won't find any its always picked up and used for funding. So please do come for a visit. The wildlife is awesome.< /text>

It's a lot of activity in the park such as hiking, camping, boating, water jet ski, BBQ, fishing, biking and many others. The lake have a few separate beaches with picnic table and areas with many trees and green. We charter a boat for whole day only for $250. Be your own captain and sail to any spot in the lake. There's an island in the middle of the lake. I be able to park the boat at the beach and no one get wet when off the boat. Camping sites are flat and located at higher ground. The facility offer shower room with hot water. Please follow park rangers instruction make sure don't leave any food outside otherwise you might have uninvited guests. Don't leave your pets outside especially at night because we hear coyote howling at night. Other then that we all have a lot of fun and having a wonderful experience.</Review>

Very nice area. A large campground  with full hookups except for black tank flush, but they do have a dump station. Campground sites are basically in a parking lot however there's electricity, water, and gray water dump on site.  This campground was very quiet when we are here in early February 2019. A bit pricey though ($40/night). Need to cross the road to get to the lake.<//Text>

< Review>
Came here for my bf's family reunion.  It was a nice picnic area with grills and sinks and a great view of the lake however,  it was hot af. We went in September so be mindful of the time of year<//Review>

< text>
The camp sites were nice and clean the cleaning crews came through to clean all bathrooms every 2 hours the showers were nice and hot!

Now the down sides are it sucked that we were unable to put our jet skiis and boats on the water due to the lake having that Blue/Green Bacteria my friends/my family and spent 5 days camping out there over Memorial Day Weekend and every night at 10pm like clock work the park rangers would come around to say over their PA Systems that the park was now in Quiet Hour which meant no tv's/radio's could be played outside no matter how low of a volume they may have been played which that sucked this was/is the first camp site I had gone to were they had a curfew in place as a sound ordinance!< /text>

<text>It has a man made lake with water so clear you can see to the bottom. The sand area is more like ground rocks. There is a playground on the beach area. Several picnic tables on the beach area. The grounds also included a camp site, boating, fishing and walking trails. A lovely place for the entire family. Small children can enjoy the water with out worry because the lake is so smooth.
But to enter the area it will cost 10.00.< /text><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

< review>
It's a perfect getaway from the big city and it's located like 1hour and 25 min from Los Angeles. They have a lake to visit for the day and also camping grounds. They have two different campgrounds one for people who just want to camp with a tent and another for the RV and we stayed at the RV place without an RV and was 15 dollars more , 45 for RV section and 30 just for tents. But best part about the RV section it has electricity and water. You can come and go as you please the gates always open and staff and park rangers very helpful. It is a walk to the lake though. But the campground have benches, fire pits, restroom and shower. It's very clean too. They allow boats and jet skies on the lake too</review>

For one the max. days you can spend there is 30 days out of a yr. So my boyfriend should have his own 30 days and I should have my own but they combined our days together which made it 15 days for both of us which doesn't make it right without letting us know that they did that and second the bathrooms are disgusting and bug infested and third they got on us for the rodents making a mess and some of the workers at the gaurd shack are very rude and I know I won't return and I don't recommend my friends or family or anyone for that matter to ever go there but that's all up to whoever who wants to go there I know they lost 2 paying customers< /review>< user>

Waited in line for almost an hour before we were told they weren't letting any more boats on the water. They should have had someone posted at the entrance to ti boaters that instead of letting us waste our time in line. Very disappointed in them<//Text>

Restrooms well stocked with to and cleaned  daily. Plenty of things for the whole family to do. Camping spots are kept clean. You should bring your own fire wood or pay the rangers for wood. You won't find any its always picked up and used for funding. So please do come for a visit. The wildlife is awesome.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Actually it may be a great campground ,however we wanted to drive thru just to see what the Teardrop Trailer group gathering was all about , but GATE person refused our drive thru . We were told we could park and walk in , but me being 76 , my granddaughter bring 4 , and my daughter , and temps about 90 degees .We would never survive the far walk where the group was . We drove about 60 miles to see and learn about the gathering and I thought the facility would be friendly and accommodating . Very very sad experience .< /Review>< pictures>

Great place for boating for the day ($8/vehicle for day use + $10/boat) or camping (if you dont mind the heat...not sure on price). There are 3 boat launches now so there is less back up. It does get a bit windy in late afternoon sometimes.< /text><Response>None</Response>< user>

Lake perris is beautiful.. my 2 dogs and I parked up at the museum wanting to hike to Terri Peak, and found out no dogs are allowed at all.. we did however walk the paved path by the water instead totalling just under 4 miles. They happily swam to cool off...</Review>

Always enjoy a day at the lake. Now, since they have inspections of the boats, it doesn't get as full. They inspect the boats to make sure it doesn't have any water that might contain the muscles, as the lake is muscle free. They check every compartment, and the motor for water. If they find any water, the boat will not be allowed to enter.The hardest part on the lake it's the amount of kids, and adults driving the personal water crafts that don't have a clue of the marine rules, or that this lake is a "one way" lake. It can be dangerous. Luckily, the rangers are really helpful and stop them right away.<//review>

<text>You can go biking, kayaking, boating, camp, hike, grill, swim, etc. It's a fairly large park. A huge portion of the park is devoted to people who want to swim or boat. The park alone, however, is one huge biking route! You can expect to make a round trip of biking anywhere between 30mins to an hour. Truly awesome for biking and boating. Parking is $10 per vehicle.<//text>< response>

Man made lake in the middle of the desert. The place offers outdoor rinse showers, separate buildings for changing and bathroom. Outdoor bbq grills around picnic areas. There's limited shading, so bring an umbrell of some kind. The water is clean, not murky so swimming in it is pleasant.<//review>

<text>Wild wild west. Way to many people that don't know or don't care about watercraft safety. Personal watercraft and boats going in the wrong direction, speeding inside the 5 mile per hour bouys and of course my favorite the person on a wave runner that doesn't look when making a turn.< /text><UserId.>106403296957983669176<//UserId.><name>Jeff Threadgill</name>< rate>

This lake is awesome now. They did a great job fixing it up. Great place for boating for the day ($8/vehicle for day use + $10/boat) or camping (if you dont mind the heat...not sure on price). There are 3 boat launches now so there is less back up. It does get a bit windy in late afternoon sometimes.</review>

I was so surprised on how clean the water was. It's was very busy. The line to get in took an hour to get through. So I suggest getting there early. But even though it took so long to get in there was still a lot of beach area to set up. we are going back again soon.<//Review>

Took my jet ski around the lake a couple times was great.  The water level was way up higher than usual and crystal clear. A little bit choppy on the surface while skieing west and more choppy on the back side east bound.<//Review>

<review>This is a gorgeous campground right on the shore of Lake Perris. Each campground has a separate parking spot which is great for spacing and easy access.  The grounds are beautiful and the public restrooms with showers are clean and very convenient.  Lots of trees and grass, would definitely recommend.< /review>< Pictures>

Folks were fishing and barbequing along side the lake.   Many folks were boating.  Can recommend for a nice walk along side the lake.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

What a difference from last year! The lake has way more water and wraps around. It seems way bigger and it was pretty clean also! Perfect for taking our boat out.< /text>

The water is very clean and the facilities are awesome. Our kids love it!!!! The lake is directional and the boaters are respectful of the right of way and very friendly but the PWC (jet ski) crowd is clueless. I would rate this lake 5 stars but the lake patrol really needs to address the PWC crowd. That aside (and yes I am sending emails and making phone calls about the clueless PWC population) we will be back. This is our favorite lake in the area.< /text>

Great place to waterski/wakeboard in the mornings or tube in the afternoon. Weekends and holidays during the summer can get a bit crazy, and lots of those folks don't boat very safely, so I prefer weekdays.< /Review>

<gmapID>0x80dca0ab76284ae5:0x532c29a35fd7649e</gmapID><text>I Love this lake. The only thing I don't like is that the bathrooms aren't kept well. My children were saying that one of the stalls in the men's restroom had cobwebs with little spiders, imagine if one bit my son, and there is no soap to wash our hands. What if we're doing the picnic afterwards and we have to use the restrooms? Water isn't enough to clean our hands and eat food afterwards. There are no lifeguards but there are posts for lifeguards. Are there specific dates for them to work? People can be dumb, what if someone starts  drowning. Who's gonna save that person? Another swimmer? What if they start drowning as well just because they tried to be heroes? Sorry but these are the little things that bother me about this wonderful lake. Just thought I'd put it out there. Other than that, the lake is gorgeous.<//text></record></dataset><record>

The lake is a great place for the entire family. But its ridiculous that we weren't allowed to take our boat in because there were a few drops of water, literally a few drops.< /Text>

The 10 mile bike trail around the lake is open again! Wonderful over night sights tent and 5th wheel accommodations! The south side entrance camping area definitely needs some upgrades but still enjoyable. No accommodations at the South side entrance. There are however outhouses.</text>

Clean water and the beach is usually clean too. Try to schedule during the week or show up early because it does get packed! There's hiking trails and a campsite. People with a fishing permit may fish there, but others may not, im sure you know why, $. Thanks for reading also the entrance is $10 per car.

This area is very nice. It doesn't matter if you're camping or just staying for the day you will enjoy your time. You can rent a boat, fish and even swim. But be careful for fish hooks. (12 year olds point of view)</text>

It is a awesome place to spend the day with friends and family. There was picknick areas with grass. The beach area by the lake, and the boating area separate from the swimming area. The day we went the water was warm and it was not crowded at all. Poeple were smiling, cooking, playing, and having fun. The water is lake water so very sand but is was still fun and great. It was worth every bit of the $10.00 they charge you to get in. I loved it and will be back a lot.< /text>

Would not recommend this location. There is cops everywhere, you are not allow to swim, it's not plain fun at all. However the view is ok.< /text>

My wife and I spent a few days there in our Motorhome back in June and we really enjoyed ourselves.
It is close, convenient and clean.
The staff were friendly and helpful.
We are definitely going back to Perris Lake.<//Review>

Great place to waterski/wakeboard in the mornings or tube in the afternoon. Weekends and holidays during the summer can get a bit crazy, and lots of those folks don't boat very safely, so I prefer weekdays.<//text>

I really enjoyed camping out here the whole scenery was awesome woke up at 2:30 in the morning listening at howling wolves outside my tent watching our souls at night fishing during the day taking the boat out during the day I went with a group the group was cool I miss the group and I miss the people that we miss me since then we no longer associate but this is a place to make memories and I'm glad I made a few in my life</text>

< review>
My wife and I spent a few days there in our Motorhome back in June and we really enjoyed ourselves.
It is close, convenient and clean.
The staff were friendly and helpful.
We are definitely going back to Perris Lake.< /review>

Love it.I have been going to Lake Perris for over 35 years ever since the Dome family worked there. Plenty of fishing boating, camping, picnicking, water skiing, and swimming for all kids? Damn I love this place. By: Frank Villalobos</text>

<review>The lake is very nice..the swim beach is nice but would be best to visit on a week day when theres less people..went on Saturday and the crowd was expected..very disrespectful people moved in next to us and started blasting their music..left after awhile because it was annoying..the campground sucks..at least RV camping..barely any room to park..u are right next to people with your firepits side by side..all the people camping were ghetto..trash everywhere..kids burning leaves in the firepits smoking people out..people all hours dumpster diving for recyclables..I've never been to such a horrible campground..never again!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

The water is much cleaner and they usually try to keep the park clean. The only reason I gave it 3 stars and not 4 stars is because the young state park officials will red tag your boat for any reason.  They will not work with you at all. My boat had about 2 ounces of water that my ice chest leaked I literally cleaned it up with 1 napkin. Because of that I got red tagged.  That's not the only time I had a rope that I use to tie my boat. The rope was damp not wet but damp. You guessed it.  I got red tagged.< /Review>< UserId.>

It has been over 30 years since I went to this lake. I use to go as a kid. Stop going because I heard the upkeep was very poor. My experience was very positive and I look forward to going back in the summer.< /Review>

Considering how close it is to the city, Lake Perris is kept pretty clean, has decent restrooms and camping sites, and has a lot to offer. Gets a bit crazy on holiday weekends, and in general the law enforcement is pretty strict and merciless. But maybe that helps the park stay nice and keeps crazies away.< /Text>

We had a great time. Lots of room, clean restrooms, life guards are attentive and they are always patrolling the beach.</Review>

It used to be a pretty clean lake but now its full with...moss? The only things this place is good for is picnics, jogs, bike riding, and looking at the little nature there is(while its still got anything).<//Text>

I have a wonderful time at Lake Perris. I know the Lake has a bad rep, but this is my 4th time taking my Skis and everything is always awesome.  5 star to the crew and thanks to the families that make it nice also.<//text>

<rate>3</rate><text>Ok. No fire pits where we were in group area. Very loud neighbors in the group area next to us, we couldn't sleep over the loud Spanish music and karaoke plus loud people singing and dancing. I can appreciate the fact they were having a great time and probably went here to have the freedom to be loud without complaints but for people like us with friends and families looking for peace and nature quiet it was a bummer. Sometimes it is what it is when you camp. We still liked it. It was clean but they need soap in restrooms for sure. Large group fire pit was awesome. Water and sink was great and handy. Needs more trees for shade. Couldn't see lake at all from camp which was a bummer too. I think there are better local camp locations for groups, we enjoyed lake Hemet. It may be just our particular group site. I will review again after camping in regular spots.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><user_name>JAELYN DOGWATER<//user_name>< Gmap_id>

Great alternative to the beach, you don't have to fight for parking, $10 admission per vehicle which is about the same for the beach if you find parking in a reasonable time at the beach.   Bring a canopy and chairs, even saw people bbq'ing it up, which I'll bring mine next time! You don't have to worry about the waves taking your kids away like the beach either, personally I'd rather go here than the beach because the little kids though is definitely hotter but tiki each their own in my opinion, at least the bathrooms didn't smell like you know what, toilet flush is really weak, so hope you don't have a big log to drop off lol going to have to bring a boat or sea doo to experience that another time here.<//text>

<username>Heather Tran< /username><date>1564731127411< /date><rating>5< /rating><text>So i am writing this review because i only came here based on others reviews so hoping mine helps out to. I never ever even heard of perris beach i wanted to take my kids to a beach before summer ends but didnt want to deal with the drive so i googled closest beach to me and perris beach popped up i was like where is this? Read the reviews and said ok lets check it out. Love that its close to us just 30 mins away i didnt have to deal with hours of bumper to bumper traffic to get to the beach. Just $10 to get in per vehicle amazing prices. Brought our own food and drinks what an awesome cheap family fun day without breaking my wallet. We went on a tuesday and it wasnt crowded at all we parked in lot 1. I loved that it wasnt crowded and it was very friendly family people. The water felt amazing and was clean. Life guard was on duty so i felt safe with my kids. My whole family enjoyed being there for 6 hours had so much fun and we will definitely be back we found our new beach place.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>We had the first 2019 NICA MTB race here and boy oh boy was it a fun venue! everything is pretty clean and we had a lot of fun. No one in our group went in the lake so I can't say much about it, but it didn't look bad at all from the shore haha👍👍< /Text><response>None< /response>< Pics>

< review>
Unbelievably crowded for 4th of July. Took us 2 hours to get in,  1 hour to get out. Once inside it was nice, but with the big crowds should have had a better plan to handle rush. We had reservations, but many people waited for 2 hours only to be told they couldn't get in and had to turn around.< /review>

Always beautiful there and we always have a nice time. No service though for our phones. What if something happens on the trails and we can't get in touch with anyone.  Need to put a cell phone tower there.</Text>

Clean (as a natural lake can be). Quiet. Easily accessible. Be sure to have your tags and have them double check your boat before you leave- if you return and something is barely askew they'll turn you away and you can't return for a week.<//Review>

A great little area to hang out with a few friends or even a family. I didn't go on a busy day so I can't say anything on parking but there are a lot of parking lots so I don't see how it would be any trouble looking for parking.< /Text>

<Review>$10 fee for entrance. That's a good deal to kayak, comparing to other nearby lakes that want to charge $40 plus. Little crowded though, and jetskiers can be a little problematic in the summer time.</Review>< pictures>

this is a great place to go visit with family or on ur own. parking for cars is $10. we came here on a Thursday.  not a lot of people. it had lots of parking. the only thing I suggest is bringing a canopy, umbrella or tent to go near the swimming part of the lake because there are no trees for shade . and some chairs and a picnic blanket . there are plenty of trees and tables but not near the swimming area. and I like that it has a wash/ shower station like at the beach. we parked in Lot 1&2. it also has a camping area.< /text>

If you have an RV and want to camp out in a parking lot, this is the place for you! The beach was insanely crowded, there was music playing until 1 in the morning, and it took 45 minutes just to get through the gate for registration. This is at the top of my list for places not to go to again.<//Review>

Sucks with water level so low. Was a great place when the water level was back to normal. Dam wall is almost fixed and when fixed the water level is supposed to be brought back. Will be 4 stars when that happens. Lots of fond memories when I was a kid here.< /text>

They have an officer there that treats minorities as if they are less than others. I watched him first hand. He gave out tickets more to people of color over the five days we were there than others. Made the vacation awful.< /review>

Water level is up, clean, and clear, check with the workers for algae toxicity. For a secluded picnic area try the bersconi entrance off Ramona express way.< /text>

They have an officer there that treats minorities as if they are less than others. I watched him first hand. He gave out tickets more to people of color over the five days we were there than others. Made the vacation awful.</Review>

Dropped off people for a music festival. I drive Uber. Took me 3 hours to get in and out on a narrow one way road. God forbid there is a fire or emergency...we would have all died. Terrible traffic. Avoid this place.</text>

We attended a family reunion here; we were told there would be free parking, if we told the rangers which party we were part of. When we approached the ranger station, the girl working was insistent on us having to pay the park fee.
We had to go through a very difficult process to get our money back. $10 isn't a big deal, but it added up to the park ripping us off hundreds of dollars, due to the amount of people that attended. The station we originally went through said they couldn't refund us, so everyone had to make the long drive to the other station, on the other end of the park.
Very disappointed with the ranger's lack of knowledge & customer service.
We love the park, but won't be planning anymore events here.< /text>

The lake was rather gross this last time we went, with lots of algae, or something like that floating around. It's still a great place to go out, though. If you're on a boat, though, watch out for those jet skiiers, last time we went they were somewhat reckless.
Otherwise great place to go.</Review>

Large space for hiking and exploring with your animals, children, mountain bikes, and whatever else you have. Parking can be limited if busy, and yes difficult to find someone to pay the park entrance fee.<//Text>

< review>
Just finished an 11 mile bike ride in their newly paved bike path. They still have to finish the path on the retrofitted  levy. But this place is great to bring the family. Plenty of parking, picnic tables, restrooms, bbq's, & shade fron the scorching sun. Clean water in the reservoir where you can fish, jet ski, kayak, or whatever you desire involving water sports. For $10 entry let vehicle you can't beat that. Come during the week to miss out on the crowds. You can camp out too if that's your bag.

Think it's time for me to get into paddle boarding.<//review>

BEWARE TO VISITORS, make sure you follow all speed limits and make full complete stops. They have a ranger that it seems his whole purpose in the park is to watch for infractions, so beware.

The park has been cleaned up nicely and the camping is nice. Make sure you take some EZ ups for your campsites because temps can get pretty high. Most tables in the picnic area have shade though. Overall nice park.<//review>

<review>Sucked 10 dollar 2 park is 2 expensive 2 have done nothing or seen nothing. That was a waste, I gave 10 dollar away for nothing. What was the point of paying 10 dollars. Boring no excitement nothing exciting to do or nothing entertaining to see. Back in the days you were able 2 go fishing. Definitely Not a place 2 fish.<//review>< pictures>

Clean bathrooms, but no soap. Hot water showers but showerhead PAINFULLY concentrated. Electric, freshwater & grey water hookups, but no black water hookup. Firepit & picnic table at camp sites.  Mountain bike trails, lake access & bald eagles in February. Little shade.< /Text>

< Review>
The lake is full! All the ramps are open again and they have the flow of traffic for boats in and out going much better this year.  The marina has a store for the last minute necessities.  If you are camping, make sure you get a reservation and know it's going to take a very long time to check in but it is a nice campground with clean showers and bathrooms.  Note to the wise, if your campsite is vacant the night before you can likely check in early, they opened check-in at noon yesterday, wish we had known!  There will be an extra charge for extra vehicles, the max is 3 per site no exceptions with now overflow lot so if you have more than 3 you will need a second site.  Also, if you have boats, the launch fee is not included in your camping fees.  Book early if you need hooksups, the campground does fill up
We did see lots of sites in tent only loops open.<//Review>

This state park is well managed and the rangers/staff are very friendly and helpful and most importantly welcoming to visitors.  They are genuinely interested in helping you enjoy and learn at the park.</Text>

<user_id>113513014727262370537< /user_id><Review>Unless you want to feel like you are camping in Tijuana,  don't camp here. "Noise ordnance" at 10pm that no one enforces. So it's apparently totally okay that 4 different sites are blasting music all night long. No time limit to what time you can show up, so expect to be woken up by people showing up and setting up their camp late at night, and of course they will also blast music and yell to each other, regardless of the time of night. There are no patrols, and no one at the front office to go to at night.Your only option would be to call 911. sites are crammed together and there are no designated walk ways to the restrooms, so people literally just walk through your camp. No patrols means no one enforcing the noise ordnance. My little kids were awake all night. This is our second time, and it was like this both times. We won't be coming back here.</Review><Resp>None</Resp><time>1492357162706<//time>< pics>

Typical recreation area. The lake isn't the nicest, but it's local and is great for small scale sailing.< /Review>

Unless you want to feel like you are camping in Tijuana,  don't camp here. "Noise ordnance" at 10pm that no one enforces. So it's apparently totally okay that 4 different sites are blasting music all night long. No time limit to what time you can show up, so expect to be woken up by people showing up and setting up their camp late at night, and of course they will also blast music and yell to each other, regardless of the time of night. There are no patrols, and no one at the front office to go to at night.Your only option would be to call 911. sites are crammed together and there are no designated walk ways to the restrooms, so people literally just walk through your camp. No patrols means no one enforcing the noise ordnance. My little kids were awake all night. This is our second time, and it was like this both times. We won't be coming back here.</text>

Underrated lake. Usually not super busy or crowded during the summer, the park has both primitive camping and sites with hookups, and if you have a trailer you will be glad to have the A/C cranked since it gets hot. There are beaches for swimming, a quaint marina with boar rentals and the requisite store, and picnic areas near the shore with green grass(!). There's even a cool island in the middle of the lake you can explore and have a picnic on.
As of August 2018 the water level has risen significantly since repairs to the dam were finished. You can go 35 mph on the lake while dragging your drunk family behind you on an inner tube, while nearly bowling over kayaks and smaller boats. Its not quite as crazy as Lake Elsinore, but expect weekends to be worse. Also, it's not the greatest for bass or other trophy fishing but there are plenty of bluegill, catfish, and smaller fish, and you can fish on the docks for 3$ a day (try live bait). Also, there are no kayak or paddleboard rentals I am aware of, which is definitely a missed oppurtunity.
All in all, this lake is on the rebouund and does not deserve the bad rap that people give it.<//Text>

<Text>Park was very large. Plenty of parking for beach goers plenty of parking for RV camping as well. Lawn was very well kept as was the sany area. There is a line of stagnant water just at the shore line that i had to hop over. A simple dregging would suffice. All in all had a great experiance. Oh yeah ...can rent jetskis too< /Text>< Pics>

< review>
Underrated lake. Usually not super busy or crowded during the summer, the park has both primitive camping and sites with hookups, and if you have a trailer you will be glad to have the A/C cranked since it gets hot. There are beaches for swimming, a quaint marina with boar rentals and the requisite store, and picnic areas near the shore with green grass(!). There's even a cool island in the middle of the lake you can explore and have a picnic on.
As of August 2018 the water level has risen significantly since repairs to the dam were finished. You can go 35 mph on the lake while dragging your drunk family behind you on an inner tube, while nearly bowling over kayaks and smaller boats. Its not quite as crazy as Lake Elsinore, but expect weekends to be worse. Also, it's not the greatest for bass or other trophy fishing but there are plenty of bluegill, catfish, and smaller fish, and you can fish on the docks for 3$ a day (try live bait). Also, there are no kayak or paddleboard rentals I am aware of, which is definitely a missed oppurtunity.
All in all, this lake is on the rebouund and does not deserve the bad rap that people give it.</review>

I've heard countless negative comments over the years about this lake and it's camping accommodations; the reason it took me twenty years to check it out for myself.

I have to say with few exceptions: the majority of criticisms were inaccurate -- at least when our family visited. The water was clean, the people were friendly and the campsites pass for decent. Trees are a bit thin so take an owning of some sort.

<Review>Great area to get away for awhile. Kayak course 7 miles from Sail Cove  across front of Dam , down shore by Bernasconie beach. Around Perris Island, and back to Sail Cove . Be careful not to get hit by Bassboats speedboats and jet skis. Some ppl there not too bright about water.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<text>I really wish that Lake Perris would make sure that there was NO YELLOWED GRASS AREAS (9&10)
. I was VERY DISSAPOINTED to see so much of the lake grass, and picnic areas had been NEGLECTED (not watered) on such a LARGE SCALE this is just not okay....! I hope this problem will be fixed very soon.<//text><name>Rebecca Walker< /name><rate>2</rate><pics>None</pics><Date>1404600492760</Date><UserId.>109358876825777517364</UserId.></record>

<rating>2< /rating><Review>Its ok. I personally think that they could do better up keep.This is my 2 time visiting and my expectations of this place haven't changed for the better. First time my husband and I were packing up and someone stole our portable grill. This time the water was filthy and the bathrooms and free showers we're disgusting. I've been to TJ and it made them look like a  hilton. Yup a hilton.

The people are all incompetent at the marina when it comes to parking your boat there. Don't listen to anything they say, because after you've paid for transport of your boat, de-muscling, registration and everything else, you show up and they say: "sorry, we can't take your boat. Did you get the names of all the people you talked to??? No?? Oh.. too bad then ".<//review>

The People that work here will tell you that they are understaffed but in reality they are just underworked a lot of the staff is just standing around not doing anything and when they are it seems like they are in slow motion the only reason I even gave 2 stars is for the lake itself<//text>

Lake had a lot of algae. The beach was coarse with pebbles. We weren't boating, but it looked like the folks with boats were having more fun than we were. I would avoid the toilets...<//text>

Had alot of fun at the lake today. Only thing is you now have to wear a life jacket if you want to use a floaty in the lake, so it was a bummer not getting to use the floaty, but still had fun</Review>

(Translated by Google) The place is very beautiful and pleasant to spend with the family ... The bad thing is that I went on weekdays and the bathrooms and dressing rooms were closed ??? In other words, they do not think about the needs of people, they go overboard.

<text>(Translated by Google) Nice place to take the family. One has to be there very early to have a good place to spend the day. The water is not cold at all, the only bad thing is people who do not understand that they should not throw garbage, there are people who even eat in the water. Let's be aware and take care of our green areas

(Original)
Bonito lugar para llevar a la familia. Uno tiene que estar ahi muy temprano para tener un buen lugar para pasar el dia.  El agua nada fria lo unico malo es la gente que no entiende que no debe de tirar basura hay personas que hasta dentro del agua comen.  Seamos concientes y cuidemos nuestras áreas verdes</text>< Date>

(Translated by Google) Beautiful place to get out of the fast pace, rest and free the mind, there is plenty of parking and areas to eat and cook. I went with my partner and had a great time, we returned another day with friends and it was fun, we played guitar and sang some songs on the shore of the lake. Spectacular!

Hermoso lugar para salir del ritmo acelerado, descansar y liberar la mente, hay mucho parqueo y áreas para comer y cocinar. Fui con mi pareja y la pasamos de lo más lindo, regresamos otro día con amigos y fue muy divertido, tocamos guitarra y cantamos algunas canciones en la orilla del lago. Espectacular!< /review>

(Translated by Google) A perfect place for a family weekend. It is not to choose it as a repetitive destination, rather it is to escape a little from society and de-stress a bit. Anyway it is a good place, there are water games but they are only open on weekends and holidays, there are also jet ski rentals but they are very expensive. (It is still a beautiful place) (look for me as “Luis's travels on youtube, facebook and instagram)

(Original)
Un sitio perfecto para un fin de semana en familia. No es para elegirlo como destino repetitivo, mas bien es para escaparse un poco de la sociedad y desestresarse un poco. De cualquier forma es un buen lugar, hay juegos acuáticos pero sólo abren fines de semana y días festivos, también hay rentas de motos acuáticas pero son muy caras. (No deja de ser bonito lugar)(búsquenme como “Los viajes de Luis en youtube, facebook e instagram)<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Beautiful place to get out of the fast pace, rest and free the mind, there is plenty of parking and areas to eat and cook. I went with my partner and had a great time, we returned another day with friends and it was fun, we played guitar and sang some songs on the shore of the lake. Spectacular!

(Original)
Hermoso lugar para salir del ritmo acelerado, descansar y liberar la mente, hay mucho parqueo y áreas para comer y cocinar. Fui con mi pareja y la pasamos de lo más lindo, regresamos otro día con amigos y fue muy divertido, tocamos guitarra y cantamos algunas canciones en la orilla del lago. Espectacular!< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I will not return to air they give you a fine for anything I like many cars were parked near the water and the public servants passed by talking through Bosina
The truth is, I didn't understand what he said afterwards, they came to my car and gave me a fine. I wanted to ask them what was happening, he didn't want to tell me and until he got angry, grabbing a gesture as if he wanted to hit me.

(Original)
No vuelvo air te dan multa por cualquier cosa yo como muchos carros estábamos estacionados sercas del agua y los servidores públicos pasaron ablando por la Bosina
la verdad no le entendí lo que dijo después se asercaron ami carro y me dieron una multa les quise preguntar que estaba pasando no me quiso decir y asta,se enojó asiendo un gesto como queriendo golpearme</Review>< pictures>

<text>(Translated by Google) I will not return to air they give you a fine for anything I like many cars were parked near the water and the public servants passed by talking through Bosina
The truth is, I didn't understand what he said afterwards, they came to my car and gave me a fine. I wanted to ask them what was happening, he didn't want to tell me and until he got angry, grabbing a gesture as if he wanted to hit me.

(Original)
No vuelvo air te dan multa por cualquier cosa yo como muchos carros estábamos estacionados sercas del agua y los servidores públicos pasaron ablando por la Bosina
la verdad no le entendí lo que dijo después se asercaron ami carro y me dieron una multa les quise preguntar que estaba pasando no me quiso decir y asta,se enojó asiendo un gesto como queriendo golpearme</text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) This place fascinates me ... it is super clean. And best of all, the staff of workers are always there to help us. Although we need a little supervision with respect to the people who always drink liquor. but I personally like it ..

(Translated by Google) I loved it, beautiful view and trees the lake looks beautiful, of course you have to arrive early open at 6 am and we arrived at 6:40 and it was still empty. They close at 9:00. They rent jet skis, water bikes, and bikes. But to bathe, the water is dirty, and if they go to bathe, they take care of their children. Please, I had to take out a child who almost drowned.

(Original)
Me encantó, preciosa vista y árboles el lago se mira hermoso, claro que tienes que llegar temprano abren a las 6 am y nosotros llegamos a las 6:40 y estaba vacío aún. Cierran a las 9:00. Rentan motos acuáticas, bicis acuaticas, y bicis. Pero para bañarse esta sucia el agua, y si se meten a bañar cuiden a sus niños por favor que yo tuve que sacar un niño que casí se ahogaba.< /Text>
