<text>I enjoyed my experience here Sophia and Nie was very welcoming and polite. I would definitely return. Only reason it’s not 5 star is the price. $45 dollars for gel manicure and $45 gel pedicure French tip is 5 extra dollars.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOa_WlBBJ3bsl9SZB3dLXREilxULcweoASG7lOV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Travel from out of state for vacation so it was a very last minute decision . My nail technician was VERY thorough on removing the excess cuticle skin . Usually I  have to go home and finish the job . If I'm in the area again, I will be returning to their shop . My daughter also enjoyed her pedicure . It was a great finish to her birthday trip .<//review><Date>1603135565063</Date>< userid>

<Review>They stayed open late just for us! It was an amazing experience. Very professional and great spa pedicure. The massage was better than the one I get back in California. I also got some nail art done (my first time doing that). I would totally do it again! Next time I am here, I am definitely coming here!<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>In San Diego for work on a Monday and had a break in my schedule. Decided to get a gel manicure and pedicure. Very warm greeting upon arrival and was immediately seated. One person on hands, other on feet. Ended up being one of the best nail services that I had ever received. Great eye for detail. Will come again the next time I'm in town.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I have visited almost every nail salon on the Outer Banks. I have finally found one that has exceptional customer service, is affordable, and most importantly does an outstanding job on my nails.  This is my new go to for gel nails and pedicures. Highly recommend them!****<//text>

Instantly I felt bum rushed when I got there. They told me they price and I was like "Whoa that's pretty steep!" But I did it anyways and I regretted not going with my gut feeling and walking right out the place. The finish product looks as tho a child did it. I would not recommend this place and I will never use them again.<//Text>

<Text>Very clean and reasonably priced. Got me right in, and Sophia was very patient taking layers of schalack off my nails before giving me a beautiful basic mani. She did have to take a couple phone calls, but I wasn’t in a rush. For a boutique nail salon, it was everything I expected.<//Text>< name>

I went in on a Saturday on a time crunch. They were the only place available at lunch time to take me. They took me right when I walked in. I needed a fill with gel on my acrylics and I needed it done in 40 minutes. And they got it done and did an amazing job! This place is wonderful!

Heads up: they prefer cash tips!< /review>

I've came to this place many times in the past but this last time the young girl who did my nails didn't do such a great job. The acrylic around my natural nail started to lift and within a week and a half all of the acrylic nails had fallen off completely. Super pissed because I spent over 130 with them that day. Weren't even worth the tip. Don't recommend them anymore. I decided to switch to a more modern nail spa.< /text>

When I called today someone on the other line told me that manicure, pedicure, and eyebrow wax all together will be $45 dollars. When I got there the lady started to up sale me some type of package, I told her I just wanted a regular manicure pedicure and wax she then told me it will be $55 dollars for everything. I did not argued because I need it my nails done, but I don't think I will be using this place again.  The customer service is okay, I  have experience better.< /text></record></dataset><record>

The star I am giving is for the lovely older lady who patiently changed my nail colour because it was a shade lighter than what I had asked. I also enjoyed the pedicure although I have had the same pedicures done in other salons which were cheaper. The place itself is clean and inviting  👍🏽⭐️

The young lady that does acrylic may be good BUT for some reason mine were badly done! It was not worth the price at all and I’ve had better nails done in other areas than what I ended up with at TH. Maybe it’s the style or something she is not familiar with but I am not impressed and will certainly not wish to return for a similar service.

I told them I didn’t like how they looked and they suggested I change the colour of the nails. I wasn’t offered a refund or asked what they could do to make them look better...and as customers came in, they became less engaged in asking if they could do more to change things. Customer service for the price? 👎🏾 I paid $54 👎🏾<//Text>

<review>I walked in one day and asked if I needed an appointment, she said yes so I made one online for the next day. I came in the day and time of my appointment and was told I had to wait for the woman to finish another set of nails she had just started. The woman who was originally trying to help me did not speak any English, and when I walked in just kept asking if I wanted a manicure or pedicure. I told her I just wanted the dip mani or sns mani and no pedicure. So she walks me over to a pedicure chair and I tell her again I don’t want a pedicure but she keeps asking me to sit, clearly no clue what I’m saying. So she ask another woman what I’m saying and she knew I wanted the dip manicure, but the only one available did not know how to do it. Why did I make an appointment just to have to wait?? Horrible service would not go back.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>When customers started coming in, the lady doing my nails started to do it in a hurry and ended up making a big cut on my skin.  She dropped some chemicals on my bruised nail to stop the bleeding.  Second, she applied a shade completely different from what I selected for my manicure.  There's only one nail specialist that speaks fluent English and the rest are difficult to understand.  Overall, the service is poor and I would never recommend this nail salon to my friends.</Text><date>1515399563670<//date>< gmap_id>

<Review>I GOT A FUNGAS FROM THIS PLACE! DO NOT GO HERE! When I asked them to redo my nails because of it they wouldn’t. And one woman screamed laughed and yelled in my face. Then chased me down the street when I told her I was going tell everyone about the FUNGAS!

Don't even think about it. Apparently they have no idea what they're doing.
- nails are not evenly cut
- filing nails was terrible, it's worse than when I came in.
- she applied the coat as a base
- I asked for a certain base color, they said they have it but turned out they didn't know what I was talking about.
- the white french was done very unprofessionally and was very messy
- terrible terrible terrible. I had to leave before they even finish</review>

Wasn't impressed by their nail art, nail polish bubbled a bit. I'm glad it was a bday gift and only paid the $20 difference</review>

Dino's is great! Had awesome breakfast! Fernando and his crew really took care of our office's "Bring at our Daughter's and Son's to work" day! Everyone loved the food and he was very organized, easy to work with. The food was ready at the time agreed upon (before 8am)! No fuss! I definitely feel they care about their customer and did I mention the food is great?!<//review>

<review>The Beaumont is far and away one of the finest hotel experiences I've had. Perfect location in Mayfair, very near Oxford Street shopping and walkable to many sites. Don't miss The Wallace Collection nearby on Manchester Square not even a ten minute walk. Staff at The Beaumont were top notch, extremely friendly and provided excellent care throughout my stay.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Service with kindness and a smile! I asked for extra crispy fries and while it took awhile longer for them to cook it was completely worth the wait. They were absolutely perfect! We've ordered larger orders from them as well for the office and they always fill the order promptly and everything always tastes amazing. I'd highly recommend dinos!</Text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2c8b4749a0841:0xb0db45cb0cb5812e<//gmap_id></record>

<Review>Got a western bacon burger with avocado and it was amazing! The patty, the bun, the bacon, onion rings, sauces, and thick slices of avocado all came together to create a delicious meal!  $10 for a loaded burger and a large drink seems fair to me.  5/5 would recommend.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Flavor was very good, but kinda skimpy for a half chicken. The fries were pretty good, but wished I had opted for the rice and beans. The staff was very friendly.

<review>Dino's Hungry Man Pastrami Fries is the my favorite comfort food in these parts.  You get A LOT of food when you order at Dino's.  It's not for foodie snobs but I like coming here for enjoying something when I'm hungry on a budget.

Best Value IMHO.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Dino's is one of Boyle Heights little Jems. It may not look like much on the outside but the food is amazing. I would recomend this place to anyone near the area. 10/10 No burger joint can beat the quality and price.< /Text><GmapID>0x80c2c8b4749a0841:0xb0db45cb0cb5812e<//GmapID>< Pictures>

I ask for a burger dry no dressing. I got one with dressing. When I return it all they did is switched off bread the meat and bread still had some dressing on.<//Review>

Wonderful experience! Very organized, loved the ease of doing all of my paperwork online from my iPhone, you move through the office and are treated so well all the way through. Dr. Jared and his team are incredibly knowledgeable and take very good care of you. Also, there are so many other options to enhance your smile. I was there longer than your typical appointment bc I was a new patient and the team really took the time to get to know me and find out my concerns etc. and honestly it truly didn’t even feel like I was there that long. Good vibes in the office.  Will be back in 6 mos :) Also, I’m sending my mom & family in.</Review>

<Review>For year's I've needing an implant, I've been to scared to get it done. I've been going to Packard Dental for almost 2 years now and finally got my much needed implant done. Dr. Matt and his assist (don't recall her name) were amazing. They made me feel very comfortable. The process was very fast and they made it seem so easy. Prior to this appointment all my cleanings have also been amazing. All staff I've come across at all my visits have been great. I highly recommend Packard Dental to anyone!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Tiffany has been my hygienist for years and I honestly love getting my teeth cleaned! The office is very professional, extremely clean and very organized.  Most likely will never change dentist unless I need to move out of state 😁<//text>

The whole team I've work with in a few short weeks has really proven why Packard Dental has 5 star reviews. Everything about my experience has been wonderful. They're honest, supportive, non-judgmental and want you to enjoy going to the dentist. My only regret is I didn't find them sooner now that I am moving out if state. The best dental care I have ever received!< /text>

The RDA who did my cleaning today was absolutely so awesome!! She was very gentle, made me feel comfortable, offered way cool flavors of fluoride or paste (which I had NO IDEA they had such awesome flavors!!) and overall is a beautiful facility with genuinely nice people. I would highly recommend to family and friends! Very happy that I found this dentist!<//review>

<Text>Packard Dental is amazing... such thorough service from everyone in your office — from the first call to the appointment reminders to the excellent technician care, personal visits by the dentists to the top-of-the-line equipment and beautiful office space to the sugar-free lollipops, Packard Dental treats everyone with utmost care and respect and professionalism.  I, and my whole family, are so happy to have found them!

Most amazing dentists ever! I never thought I would actually enjoy going to dentist but this group actually makes it a pleasure to be there!

Office super nice and top of line equipment.

Everyone is incredibly nice and I get to watch HGTV the whole time I am there!!

Best dentist office I have ever gone to!!

They accept my insurance and I always get full written estimate bf any fillings etc!!</Text>

<user_name>Kay Robinson</user_name><text>What a great dental office!  I think I've been here going on two years now.   Today, was a 3 unit bridge prep.  The doctor, dental assistant, and all staff are professionals.  The office is clean, well managed, and covid compliant.   I am a former dental assistant and I would have been proud to work here.
Don't spend your stimulus money on junk. Go get an exam and cleaning from the best dental office  in north county!<//text><Date>1618966114744< /Date>< response>

<review>I had a really great experience with Dr. Matt Packard. The office was able to get me in on short notice for what I thought was an urgent issue. The front office staff were super helpful and friendly, the office was clean and calm, well organized and everything felt streamlined and state-of-the-art. I'm super happy that I found them, and I don't doubt that anybody would love it here.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><date>1615398504307< /date></record></dataset><record>

Great experience! Friendly and professional staff! I enjoy having a regular cleaning/checkup by Tiffany at Packard Dental. The TV monitors mounted in the ceiling are a nice, creative touch.<//text>

My parents, siblings and I have gone to Packard Dental for many, many years. After moving a bit too far away a few years back, I returned today for my first appointment in quite some time. Walking in I was instantly reminded why I love this place. EVERY interaction is so positive and professional. From the receptionists, to the dental hygienist and of course the doctors (shout out to Dr. Matt!)- every person is so kind, helpful, compassionate and knowledgeable. They truly get to know you and make every effort to make you feel comfortable. They are not trying to nickel and dime you or upsell you. They are genuinely there to help you make the best decisions about your dental care and leave their offices feeling good. Can't recommend them enough!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I was fit in quickly for a broken tooth. As usual, Dr Jerod was very pleasant, professional and worked quickly to repair my tooth. I needed a partial crown which was made in house. A very fast and rewarding emergency visit.  This is the best dental practice I have ever been to.< /Review>

I can't say enough good things about Packard Dental.  The office is super clean and they take covid precautions really seriously.  The staff is great, they are always helpful. Dr. Matt is my dentist,  he's super friendly and nice.  Dr. Jared is my son's dentist as well as his orthodontist.  He's so funny and makes going to the dentist such a good experience.  I highly recommend going to Packard Dental, you won't regret it!<//Text>

It is extremely important to me that my clients have the absolute best care and experience when recieving health care services. Packard Dental delivered and exceeded both my client and my expectations.  From the moment I called to schedule the first appointment I was greeted with respect and kindness.  As was my client and her son when we stepped into their office. The assessment and examination was thorough. The team made my client feel comfortable and explained every detail along the way. And I really love that they follow up to make sure that the service provided was more than satisfactory. And it did it always is. My only wish is that they would have an office for my other clients in Southern San Diego.<//Text>< userid>

<review>I was referred to Packard Dental from a good friend and coworker. My friend spoke highly of Packard's Dental Group. I must say, I was blown away from the first phone for my initial check up appointment, to the attention of every detail of my experience.  The receptionist greeted me with smiles even through their masks. Victoria brought me in, gave me the grand tour (very impressive) Doctor Matt gave me a complete check up, maintenance plan, and got me started right away with repairing my dental issues. I have been afraid to go to the dentist for years due to bad painful experience. Doctor Matt and his assistant Nancy performed a Root canal, implant, and a couple of crowns with little to no pain. If you're looking for a fantastic experience,  a Dental group that treats you like family, look no further than Packard Dental. I will be referring all my family and friends. Thank you Matt, Nancy, Nicole, Victoria, Melissa and all of the amazing staff.< /review>< pics>

<name>Chad Holland<//name><date>1616835462534<//date><rating>5</rating><Review>The Packard family are renowned for dentistry, for good reason. They are well educated, skilled, "fair dealing", and personable. I grew up in Carlsbad in the 80's and went to their clinic. They kept me informed and clean, no fillings (I can't say the same for my time before, going to to Carlsbad dental firm "Peterson and Sundquist"). Now, 40 years later, Dr. Matt is continuing the service and I couldn't be happier. Honest, thoughtful, and adept medical expertise works hand in hand with organized, friendly, and informed staff. Dental health is critical for all of us. Dental pain alone is enough to prove that point, but it is only the tip of the iceberg. Bad teeth are deadly. They brought down Ramses the Second, the most powerful pharaoh of Egypt! If Doc Matt had been Ramses the Second's dentist, I think Ramses would have had another ten years. I'm not sure if Moses would still be wandering then, though, and Ramses, frankly, had issues. Those extra ten years could have been a lot more enslavement and persecution for someone, because that was his business model.  Besides, these advances in dentistry had not yet been invented. The point is that Packard Dental is a great clinic for your dental health needs. And, no, no one paid me to write this. It's just my rambling and anti-Ramses the Second protest.<//Review>< pics>

We have been going to Packard Dental for years and have always had a nothing short of amazing experiences getting our teeth cleaned with Allison Berry. It’s to the point now that my kids won’t allow anyone else to clean their teeth! She’s the best!  From the cleanings to xrays and easy billing, we have always been happy with this practice. I recommend to everyone I know.< /review>

I had 10 veneers done with Dr. Matt yesterday and it was such a pleasant experience. He gave me an oral sedative which made the 3 hour appointment feel like 20 minutes. It was completely pain free and I was so relaxed that I even fell asleep for most of it. His assistant, Lis, was so comforting and great at her job. My temporary veneers look amazing and I'm completely pain free today. I couldn't have asked for a better experience!</text>

This place is well deserving of all its exceptional reviews. I've been coming here for 4 years now. What makes them stand out is the combination of their excellent customer service, dental skills, and honest and transparent feedback. Packard makes going to the dentist pleasant, which is something we all can agree is awesome.< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

I can’t say enough good things about Packard. First of all, it’s like walking into Pleasantville. I was taken aback when I had my first appointment a few years ago... this place had an ora about it like no other medical office I had been to. Everyone there is incredibly happy and always smiling. You can’t walk out without having a smile too.
My stepdaughters are 9 and 11- they genuinely look forward to going here. They are jealous of each other if one has an appointment and the other doesn’t. They are so kind and willing to do whatever they can to help you, even if it’s last minute. This is not a business; this is a family doing what they love. I’m not just speaking about Matt and Jared, but also the people who work there. It’s like they have a happy-meter that they use to determine if someone is pleasant and warm enough to work there.
On the other hand, their work may even be better than their personalities... they are so gentle, pay close attention to detail and make sure that you’re comfortable when you’re there. I’ve had A LOT of work done there and got my braces there. For the around 40 appointments or more that I’ve had there, I have not had one bad experience, not even for a second.

Thank you so much, guys! You and the crew are absolutely amazing!</Text>

I just got my braces on a few months ago. Amanda and Dr. Jared are so good! It was painless and my smile is already getting better!  And when Nicole cleans my teeth, even with all the brackets and wires, she still gets them perfectly clean.< /Review>

Packard Dental is awesome for kids. I had a cavity and wasn't looking forward to going to the dentist. Nicole got me numb and I didn't even feel it. Then the Dr. Jared fixed my tooth while I watched TV the whole time!! Fast, easy and good as new. Thanks Packard Dental.</Text>

Providing consistent, high-quality service to my family since 1988. I appreciate the extra care taken for Covid-19 protection. And the cheerful attitude by all staff in doing so. Latest dental technology is great including panoramic x-rays & laser treatments. Today I saw Jennifer & Dr. Jared. A pleasure - and who says that going to the dentist?!?<//Review>

<Review>We have been going to Packard Dental for years and have loved our experience with them! They are great with our kids and have a clean safe environment. Dr Matt has fixed a chipped tooth for me that looks perfect now and we are starting braces with Dr Jared this month and can’t wait to see the results! They have gotten us in quick for my chipped tooth and husbands painful root canal. Their office staff is kind and friendly also!< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
First time here. I was immediately given a tour of the entire office, which was great. Everyone is incredibly friendly and helpful. I had several issues, as it's been a while since I've been to a dentist. They all took their time with me to explain things or whatever needed to done, as if I was their only patient. I can honestly say I had fun at the dentist. :)</Review>

Packard Dental is the dentist you figured you would only find after you leave Earth and go to Heaven. All of the personnel are gracious yet authentic. I feel like I have been going there all my life. I have yet to experience even a twinge of pain which is testimony to the skill and care level at this premier facility. The spaces are tastefully done and immaculate. I'll say it, I actually look forward to going to the dentist now! Really!< /text>

When you walk in the front desk staff is friendly and engaging. My first appointment was right on time (so refreshing considering most doctors are usually slightly behind), Matt was upbeat and honestly excited to check on my teeth. The x-rays went smoothly and as pain free as possible. Then off to my cleaning which was thorough and again very professional. So thanks to the whole team at Packard Dental for making my first dental appointment in a few years an amazing experience. See you guys again in six months!<//text><name>Jake Horton</name>< GmapID>

The kids loved the treasure chest and were so excited to be there. They have a great kid waiting area too which was awesome. Both kids are excited to go back for appointments in 6 Months! This was their first time at the dentist and it couldn’t have gone better! Thanks Packard Dental! Dr. Jared was awesome!<//Text>< name>

I have moved away from Carlsbad a few times but I always keep Jared Packard as my dentist because I couldn't imagine going anywhere else. Everything here is incredible. The service is amazing, the office is beautiful and everyone there is a joy to be around.< /Review>

My most favorite dentist office ever! (And I'm no spring chicken!) Thorough, talented, gentle, and kind. Front office is staffed well and extremely competent too. Everything is incredibly clean.  👍 I don't have one bad thing to say.  😊 ❤</text>

<Text>Just came home from getting a root canal and prep for a new 3 unit bridge. My other bridge lasted over 40 years. The ENDO doc was fantastic. Dr. Jared prepared my mouth for the new bridge.  Professional and very caring office.  This is my second visit with them. I am so glad we picked this office.  Every single person knows what they're doing. So very happy with my care.  Still numb but don't expect any problems.  Was reminded to call with concerns or questions. Had an email follow up care letter before I got home.< /Text>< pictures>

<user_name>Cameron Christensen<//user_name><time>1575571552414<//time><rating>5</rating><Review>I'd give Packard Dental 11 stars if I could. I had Tiffany do my x-rays and the cleaning. She's awesome- no pain in any part of the cleaning, she let me choose what was on the ceiling-mounted TV, and she had an appropriate amount of chit-chat while we she was cleaning my teeth. I was especially impressed with Dr. Jared. There were a few "iffy" spots on my teeth and he came in and said we would watch them closely, but he did not want to do work that was not necessary. I really appreciated that he put my needs over the need to do extra work for extra billing. Long story short, everyone here is extremely professional and skilled. I've been going to Packard Dental for over five years, and I would recommend them to anyone.< /Review>< pics>

I really enjoy getting my teeth cleaned by the hygienists at Packard Dental. They are friendly and the cleanings feel really good. When I meet with Dr. Jared, I feel he is very honest with what I actually do or don’t need for treatment on my teeth. I like coming here for my dental care.</text>

After a terrible dental experience 8 years ago I just stopped going to the Dentist; I always felt judged about my teeth and lied to about the condition they were in. Not at Packard! Since the moment I walked in the door (cheesy as it sounds) I felt comfortable and welcomed there. Nancy, Alexa, and Dr. Matt were extremely calming and made sure I had all the information I needed to feel at ease. Turns out my teeth weren't as horrible as other Dentists have said, I didn't have to spend thousands of dollars if I wanted to "save my smile". I walked in after having not gone to a dentist in 8 years and all I needed was a good cleaning! I now have my regular cleaning set up with Packard and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for knowledgeable and honest Dental Professionals.<//review>

Packard Dental has had a long history of dental work with our family--about 32 years. We are very pleased with the quality of their work. We love that they are a family-run business. Recently, Dr. Matt has been my dentist, and I have to say, he is the most friendly and humorous dentist I've ever had. His work is excellent, and I'm guessing he is on the cutting edge of dental technology because he uses all new equipment that makes procedures super fast and pain free. I highly recommend Packard Dental.</Review>

The office is warm, inviting, and modern. The staff are always smiling and make you feel welcome. But the best part is how great they are with kids. My 3 year old has had his first check up and cleaning here with great success. They are gentle, patient, and actually make him excited to brush/floss. Dentist visits have become one of his favorite things- I can't recommend them enough :)</text>

<review>Dr. Jared does amazing work! My husband and I Love that Packard Dental is so family oriented and everyone in the office is very kind and friendly! From the moment we walked threw the doors we felt like we were family. I was new in the area and had an emergency root canal needed and was in horrible pain! I called and they made sure to get me in the same day to get me out of that pain and stable till I could come in the next day for the actual procedure! They actually CARE here and I'm so thankful to have found them. Who would have thought I'd be excited to go to the dentist ?! Hahaa the office is beautiful and clean! Very kid friendly and they do everything they can to work with out on treatment options and plans. Chelsey at the front desk is a sweetheart as well she's usually who answers when I would call to make appointments! So if your in need of a dentist trust me when I say THIS PLACE IS IT! My son just turned 2 and I will be entrusting our little man to Dr.Jarded and the staff at Packard for is first check up!!

I came to Packard Dental with dentures for my top teeth and worn missing teeth for my lowers. Being disabled and on a tight budget I would have never thought that I could afford dental implants. Packard Dental was willing to work with me and help stay within my budget. Now complete all I have to say is that these guys are great. My smile is wonderful and my face now looks like it did years ago. Plus I can now eat foods I thought I would never get to eat again. Thank you Packard Dental for everything you have done, I feel like a new lease on life has been given to me. I look great thanks to Doctors Matt and Jared, the two miracle workers of dentistry. I thank you both very much.<//Text>

This is a great dentist office.  I have been going to Packard since moving to the area, and I've had a great experience.  I unfortunately had a lot of work to be done, but Dr. Jared has gotten me back to a good place and has put me on the path to a long, healthy mouth.   The whole staff, from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave is incredibly friendly.  The equipment and technology in the offices seems current, without the feeling that you're being overcharged to cover a lavish office. I recently completed a successful checkup, which is a huge milestone for me!  Thanks Dr. Jared and team.<//text>

This was my first visit to Packard Dental. It was an enjoyable and smooth visit from start to finish. Dr. Jared, Kendra and Karla were all personable and authentic. They take the time to get to know their patients. Plus, they were all gentle yet thorough with my teeth! I always enjoy that feeling of extra clean teeth after the dentist.

Their overall service was excellent and I am actually looking forward to my next visit!</Review>

<review>As I said on Yelp, if I could give this place 10 stars, I would! I am a WIMP when it comes to going to the dentist as I had a traumatic experience in the dental chair when I was a teen. This office is by far THE MOST kind, caring, and compassionate dental office I've ever been to. Nicole is the best hygienist ever...over this past year, she's gotten to know me...listened to my story and understands my fears. The first time I had a tough procedure, they gave me flowers to celebrate my victory! This morning I went through another hard procedure and managed it without nitrous or numbing. The topical anesthesia was just strong enough, and Nicole continually checked in with me to see if I needed more or wanted to go for the numbing. They worked with me on bringing costs down, too. It's rare to go to the dentist and feel loved, but these people really work from their HEART. Can't recommend them enough!!! <3<//review>< gmapID>

<review>I recently moved from Atlanta, Ga to the San Diego area. I work close by so the location is perfect! Before moving I'd been seeing the same dentist office for over 20 years so choosing a new place felt a bit daunting. I couldn't have chosen better than Packard. Everyone was kind and welcoming and I had a great experience.

The dentist I saw was Dr. Jared Packard and he made the exam process painless. Very pleasant demeanor as well.

The hygienist I saw was Kendra and she also did a wonderful job on my cleaning. Super friendly and great with making sure I was totally comfortable and pain-free through the whole thing. I've had a bad experience before with feeling like my mouth was being stretched way too much so I'm glad to have found someone who won't do that!

I'll be coming back for my regular cleanings :)<//review><time>1423686271063< /time>< Resp>

This place is the best! I came here originally for an exam to get my wisdom teeth out and stayed ever since. Mark, Jared, and Matt are really sincere dentists that are great at what they do. Nicole is the best for cleanings and check ups! She has amazing rapport and lots of knowledge - so great! Overall, super great patient relationships and they’re all committed to making sure you leave with a great experience and some super clean teeth! Amanda helped me with my ortho consult and she was just wonderful. Rosie has done all the work behind the scenes with my insurance and has even dealt with making quotes for me when my insurance was changing over. Is there anyone on this team that isn’t great?</text>

Extraordinary service and considerate stafff...they treat me with care and respect offering solutions to my implants and overall health to my teeth. After visiting more than 5 dentists who were not willing to help, Packard Dental is a place you can trust with your family and friends for your health.< /text>

< Review>
I've been going to Packard Dental for the last 2 years. Dr. Jared and the staff always make my family and I feel at home. He did 6 veneers on me right before my wedding and they came out amazing. I was able to to smile comfortably for my wedding pictures. He is such a perfectionist, I highly recommend this office for anyone that's looking for a great dentist. #drjaredrocks< /Review>

My family and I have visited many dental offices since we moved to San Diego 4 Years ago. We are so happy to have found Packard Dental and would recommend them to anyone looking for an honest and very HAPPY group. Dr. Matt was also amazing with my 3 year old son.<//Review>

I had to muster the courage to go back to the dentist after some bad experiences. I'm glad I chose Packard. Dr. Mark took time to take me through prospective treatments and was comprehensive in his diagnosis and options. The assistants were very professional and kind. I would recommend this dentist office to anyone.<//Review>

Dr. Mark and my hygienist, Mindy, are the best!  They do everything possible to make me feel comfortable in the dentist's chair.  When does that ever happen?  Both my husband and my mother go there, too, and are very happy with their services.  I recommend Packard Dental to everyone who asks me for a referral.<//text>

For various reasons, I haven't had the best luck with my past dental experiences which caused me to jump from office to office. I was referred to Packard Dental by a co-worker at the beginning of the year but didn't go in until June. I was very glad that I followed her recommendation! The experience was great from the time I entered the office until the time I left it. The staff was friendly and professional which made it a welcoming environment. I finally found a dental office that I want to stick with so no more jumping around for me!<//review>

<review>Great as usual Five Stars from me! Tiffany did her always fantastic job on my Teeth Cleaning. Dr. Mark came in for a brief visit and checked the two crowns he put in a few months back. Thanks for the fabulous service.

Thank you again, John.

I have been going to Packard Dental for the past 12 years.  They are such a great office.  I love all the hygienists there, they all do a great job.  Dr. Jared is my dentist and he is the best!  Everyone is caring, pleasant, efficient more than competent and professional.  I recently moved down to San Diego but will keep going to Packard Dental because I don't want to change dentists.  Once you find a doctor or dentist you really trust and like, you want to keep using them even if it is a bit of a drive. I recommend Packard dental to anyone who needs good dentist.</Text>

I couldn't be more pleased with Packard Dental! The staff is warm and welcoming and feel like a family. Dr. Matt is personable, caring, and honest. Kendra is an excellent hygienist with a true love for her job and ensures you are completely comfortable throughout your treatment. I highly recommend this office and I can't wait to see the new building they are soon moving to.<//text>

<Review>Very happy with Dr. Matt and his friendly staff. We were looking for a dentist we could trust and found that with this office. They took the time to explain the reasons behind the recommendations and really listened to our concerns. We feel confident in the office and have found our long term dentist.

Everyone is very professional and friendly. Left the office happy!!

Kendra did an excellent job cleaning my teeth and was very helpful with brushing tips. Also the water jet treatment after polishing made my teeth feel really clean with no desire to rinse more. Thank you!!</Review>< pictures>

My daughter and I enjoyed our experiences with Packard Dental! Family-friendly atmosphere, clean and bright office, caring staff, top-quality dental care. Dr. Jared has a great sense of humor, and is great with both adults and kids. We loved our Hygienist, Kendra! My daughter is a bit anxious with dental work, but Kendra was always very patient and kind, and explained what was happening.

The only negative aspect for us was an insurance change (Tricare switched fron Metlife to United Concordia), and Packard was no longer an in-network provider. Although we payed more out of pocket, we chose to stay because we had such positive experiences with Packard.

Our family has just moved out of state, and we will miss Packard Dental!<//text>

Packard Dental is a stellar dental office. I have a very busy schedule and they took the time to make sure the appointment time would work for me. I hadn't had an exam or cleaning in several years, but the technicians and dentist made me feel comfortable talking about my dental health. I really liked how they asked me what my concerns were and what my dental goals were. The office is very patient centered. My hygienist, Kendra, was very gentle when I explained my sensitivity and she explained every move she made. I felt comfortable and well taken care of!  Timely, efficient, and thorough office!< /Review>

<username>Van Le<//username><Text>I went to this place because of the overwhelming positive reviews. I am here to clarify that they are very true.  Maybe I have been exposed to any good dental/dentists before that led to my excitement. After the appointment yeah, I can't believe that I actually look forward to cleaning my teeth in the next 6 months with Janae, the hygienist is very sweet.

Every step of the experience has been awesome, from scheduling my appointment to getting an entire tour of the office. Everyone is so nice and listened to any concerns I had. As a first time patient and a former dental assistant, I am extremely grateful for how well I was cared for. Plus, I got a muffin when I left and who doesn't love muffins :)<//Review>

<Review>Great new facilities with TVs in the ceiling to help pass the time while they work on you. More importantly, the work they do is great with both the assistants and dentists themselves doing a great job at both their work and informing you as to what's going on. They also do a great job to help you financially, something that saved me in a pinch after some massive dental work. They're a bit far from both my work and home but well worth the trip for me.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

What an amazing dentist. I have always hated the dentist but the people here were so personal, friendly, and efficient at their job. There was a receptionist named Shannon who blew me away with her professionalism. Honestly, she was the key factor in my awesome experience.

I had my teeth cleaned by Tiffany the other day, and as usual it was a phenomenal experience. The chairs are comfortable, and I forget that I am getting my teeth cleaned because of the TV in the ceiling. Tiffany is an expert at what she does. Can't wait for 6 months to be here!<//review>

The best! I have been with Packard Dental for years now and couldn't been more pleased with their professional and attentive attitude. I've recommended them to family and friends without hesitation. Whether it's a scheduled check up and cleaning, or an off hour emergency, we've never had to worry, they've always accommodated our needs.</Text>

I've been going to Packard Dental for 7 years.
Today I had a deep cleaning for the first time.
Kendra did an amazing job! I, of course, was a little nervous but knew that I needed it done. Kendra educated me throughout the procedure and kept me at ease.
I would highly recommend Kendra and Packard Dental.< /Review>

They will upsell the heck out of you. Really what they do is to be nice to you to get you in the seat as many times as possible for billing purposes. If you want to go there 5 times just for getting your teeth cleaned or a cavity fill at 10K go there,  if not go somewhere else where they will just get the job done for a lower cost.<//Review>

I went to see Dr. Matt because I needed a new crown. He told me that he could take care of it in one visit. All their equipment is state of the art and he replaced my old filling with a new permanent crown in less than 2 hours. They value your time and don't make you sit around and wait. Dr. Matt and Melanie made sure I was comfortable the whole time. It was painless and looks better than my old tooth. Thanks guys!<//Text>

<Text>We have been going to Packard dental for 3 years now and always enjoy good service. Our favorite hygenist is Nicole! She’s so good with our kids and makes going to the dentist fun. They always ask for her! They love getting toys from the treasure chest after their visit and of course look forward to the sugar free Xylitol lollipops too. We recommend Packard Dental... ask for Nicole!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Review>I recently had a cleaning by Nonni, and she was awesome!  She is very gentle, and personable.  Then Dr. Jared came in to check things out, and, as usual, he was so nice and kind.  I really appreciate the expert and sincere care I receive at Packard Dental. They really take care of my teeth so that I can keep them and have a great smile!  :)<//Review>< username>

I've been with Packard Dental since 1986 and their care has always been of the highest quality.  They also keep up with the latest state-of-the-art methods and technologies.  I don't see how a dentist could be more skillful and congenial than Dr. Mark.  And I would point out that he is always looking out for the patient's preventive care and ways to save money.  All the dental hygienists are good; I'm just partial to Tiffany who is worth her weight in diamonds (get it?).  If you keep up on her good advice your visits with her are so easy because of her skill, you hardly feel like you've been to the dentist's.  All of these qualities are consistent with the entire Packard Dental group and their standards are the highest.< /Text>

Dr Matt Packard is the most competent dentist I have had in my life, and having had a lot of dentists, this is saying a lot. He makes everything look easy, from root canals to crowns. The office is sterile but still attractive, and filled with the most modern and top of the line equipment. I always know I am in good hands.< /Text>

Since day one Packard Dental has been nothing but wonderful, professional, & welcoming. We have been coming for years and have never had a bad experience. They have recently moved into a beautiful new office that has ocean views and have the latest dental technology so they can give the best possible care to their patients. They even have blankets to give you while you get a cleaning or have other dental work done. That is a huge plus for someone like me who is cold all the time. ;)  If you don't have dental insurance they provide in house insurance through their program called the Packard Loyalty Program.  It is affordable and provides access to dental insurance to those who would otherwise go without dental care. I would say my favorite part is that they are all genuinely good people and they treat you like family.  I really can't say enough good about the amazing dental care they provide, the wonderful dentists, dental hygienists, and office personnel.  My kids even love coming to the dentist!!< /Text>

<text>I have always been a little fearful of going to the dentist, as I have small sensitive teeth that are prone to cavities. I am so impressed with Packard Dental because they always make me feel welcome and special. They always take extra precautions to make my teeth cleaning comfortable and take special note of my sensitivities.
They earn the extra star on this review for the quickness in which you see the dentist. Dr. Jared was in my exam room within 10 minutes of me getting to the appointment. I have never been kept waiting and I am always greeted with familiar faces and welcoming smiles.
This is hands down the best service and care you can find. The new office is in a great location and I like all of the upgrades. I have nothing but positive things to say about Packard Dental.< /text>< Response>

I've been impressed from my very first visit starting with their state-of-the-art technology as I filled out my new patient information on an iPad, continued with the text reminders (that are very appreciated in the middle of my busy life), and by the scheduling that is very accommodating. Everyone on their staff is very friendly and seem to genuinely enjoy working there. They even gave me a bouquet of flowers the first time I visited after getting engaged! I've referred several of my family members, friends, and coworkers to this office and every one of them has been extremely happy there. I'm so happy to have found a dental stuff that I can trust!<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>The Office is beautiful and the technology amazing but the most compelling reason to keep coming back to Packard Dental are the people. Everyone you meet is warm and friendly and takes the time to answer questions and explain the process of what is being done. I moved here over a year ago and resisted replacing my Phoenix dentist of over 25 years but when a tooth emergency forced the situation, I was lucky enough to get into see Dr. Matt.  I am the proud owner of a new crown, all done in one day.  I honestly can't wait to come back for my preventive exams. Thank you, Packard Dental, for making Carlsbad a little more home.< /Review>< Pics>

I have found both at Packard Dental.  Fortunately, I have only needed exams and cleanings so far, and my hygienist has been Kendra. I have one word for her, marvelous!  Kendra is friendly and warm, and gentle but very thorough.  She has given me some interesting advice, including suggesting that I use a child size toothbrush, and my good checkups seem to show that her advice is working.  The rest of the staff at Packard are great, so if you have any concerns about finding a new dentist, if you are new to the area or if you're not happy with your current dentist, give Packard a call.

< review>
After trying out many dentists my family and I were never happy with the services we received until one day a friend of mine told me about her dentist and how happy she was with them. So I looked up Packard Dental on line and I was impressed by all the positive reviews, to keep the story short I just had a crown replaced and two fillings by Dr. Jared Packard and he did an awesome job. These guys are great, I mean from the dentist to the receptionist they are all very courteous and professional. They take very good care of my family and me, and even my kids are not afraid to go to the dentist anymore. All I can say is try them out, you won't be disappointed.</review>

Amazing customer service. The staff is always friendly and cheerful. Karla, who is a one of the registered dental assistant is very sweet and she made me feel comfortable and have less anxiety. Dr. Jared is awesome! He was very open to discussing my concerns or any questions I had. I have been to other dentists before and had not so great experiences, but not here!! They really care about their patients and work with them to get the results they want! I highly recommend.< /Text>

<review>Dr. Jared is friendly and nice! He's making my retainer and he is going to personalize it with a Lego character. That is so awesome. It will be a one-of-a-kind piece just for me. Drake- 6 year old patient (written by mom, Tavia, on behalf of Drake)</review>< pics>

The staff here are really nice and professional. They seem super committed to your health and wellness, and that's important. The only reason I give 4/5 is because the facility itself/equipment is pretty outdated, but I see that they're moving into a new facility or renovating soon. Hopefully I'll be able to update my review then.<//text>

<rate>5</rate><text>I love Packard Dental! I see the dental hygienist  Kendra twice a year for cleaning and Dr Jared once a year for an exam. They are all very very sweet and gental. I honestly leave there in a better mood than when I go in.  I've also never had a problem with them billing my insurance or anything like that.  Today was definitely the icing and the already huge cake,  I told them I had recently gotten engaged and they gave me a beautiful bouquet of flowers to take home. Who does that?!

<Review>I had a great time at Packard Dental. My husband and I both needed appointments and they were able to schedule us back to back. So helpful!! It worked out perfectly to bring our kids and trade off between appointments. The waiting room is really nice and there's even a little nook for kids with toys and books. Checkin for the appointment was a breeze. The cleaning, xrays and exam were great. The staff is exceptionally friendly and competent. The dental care and advice were excellent. I recommend to everyone!<//Review>< Pictures>

This place is the best!! Kendra is one of the best hygienists who is always on top of it and super super friendly and caring :)) I always feel really comfortable here and they make my mouth feel healthy and clean! They helped me reschedule my appointment and are always super accommodating whenever I need it.  10/10 would reccommend this place!</Text>

I really appreciate the time you took to meet with me and help me to better understand how I can care for my teeth. I have had dentist tell me for years that I am doing everything to take care of my teeth but I was still getting cavities. Dr. Jared took the time to make some practical suggestions and suggested I have an acidic system that could be contributing to my cavities. I have never had a dentist take the time to sit down with me and figure out what might be going on since on paper I am doing a great job caring for my teeth and some practical ways to help prevent cavities. This was so refreshing! Everyone that I came in contact with in the office was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. This experience has really helped me to get over my previous unpleasant dental experience. Thank you!< /review>

I recently went in for my 6 month cleaning with Kendra (my hygienist) and as always she does a great job, takes her time and doesn't make you feel rushed like other offices tend to do. The staff Is always friendly and attentive from the minute you walk in until you leave. I'm also 90% done with my invisiline which I must admit looks really great and far surpasses my expectations thanks to Dr Jared and his assistant Karla. Best dental office in town hands down.<//Text>

<review>We have at long last, found a dental office where we don’t feel we have walked into a lion's den to be intimidated by hidden charges and high pressure tactics for unnecessary procedures and medications. The office is bright, modern, clean and uncluttered. The entire staff are amicable, professional, courteous, knowledgeable and answers all the queries to our satisfaction; starting from Chelsea at the front desk through Leesy – the treatment coordinator. Our dental hygienist Kendra is superb; knows what she is doing, explains step by step what would be done, gentle and unhurried.

My first visit was very welcoming! I loved how well the staff received me and being judgmental free after not visiting a dentist in a very long time. The staff explained everything they were doing and what they were going to do to me. I loved how the staff engages to their patients and remembers them as well as their conversations and that's something I really loved. Not some ordinary dental place where you get your teeth worked and bye! Nope, not here. My boyfriend recommended it to me and I highly recommend it to everyone! By far the best dental place I've ever experience!<//text>

My family has been going to Packard for 13 years.  They have been very good and have taken care of all our dental needs including crowns.  The prices are reasonable and the staff is very friendly.  If I need to look at a face while doing a dental cleaning I choose the friendly faces at Packer Dental.<//Text>

Chelsie meets me (at the front desk as I came in) with a huge smile and is very friendly and accommodating. Melanie and Erica, always so happy, have been Dr, Matt's assistants during my visits. I look forward to coming in every 4 months so Nicole can clean and assess my teeth.......... ..................and then there is Dr. MATT!!!! When I left Monterey, I thought I would never find a Dentist like I had there. Every one of my criteria and wishes are met by Dr. Matt's wonderful mannerism and honesty! He prioritizes, and does work taking my financial situation into consideration. I feel very blessed to be under the care of Packard Dental!

She is amazing and always has a smile.  I had a crown break in the afternoon and Wendy had me in the office  one hour later.  If you are looking for a great group of people that always puts you first, look no further.  From the minute you walk in the door you are treated with kindness. Packard Dental cares and they let you know it.<//Review><rate>5<//rate></record>

Not enough great things to say about this dentist! I drive down from Los Angeles to visit them. They helped me get a tooth filled same-day to avoid driving back down and getting another day off work.

I've had a lot of bad dentist experience in the past, and I'm relieved to have found Packard.< /Review>

<text>What can I say - I'm like most people and dread going to the dentist. But seeing as how my wife works in the dental field, I'm pretty much committed to going. I have to say going to Packard Dental makes it easy. Dr Jared and his staff are fun and painless. I am in the process of having my bite corrected with Invisalign which is going well. Tiffany is a great hygienist and reminds me to floss the teeth I want to keep... which I do - ha.

Yes, my wife works here but believe me the whole team goes out of their way to make each appointment a good experience for all patients.</text>< Pics>

<text>My dental journey with Packard Dental has been every step of flawless. Chelsea at reception always greets me with open arms as does my RDA, Karla. Seriously, Karla is the bomb. She and Dr. Jared (who is consistently  friendly, confident, and comforting) filled in my cavities in no time! I absolutely trust Dr. Jared, he always informs me of what is happening with my teeth. I also love Alicia at payment:) Now I know what you millennials are thinking.. is Dr. Jared "Chip Skylark" worthy?? The answer is YES! I have never had a dentist like Dr. Jared be that concerned with my comfort level! Let's just say I won't be grabbing a dixie cup of Listerine with anyone else.  All jokes aside; I absolutely appreciate the care and commitment to excellence Packard Dental exhibit. I ALWAYS leave smiling.</text><Rating>5< /Rating><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Text>I cannot say enough good things about Packard Dental!  From the moment I called to make my first appointment, to walking back to my car after a deep cleaning (worth it), I was so impressed by everybody at Packard Dental.  The front office staff is so pleasant and friendly, my hygienist Kendra, was awesome (highly recommend a cleaning with her), the office itself is so nice and clean, and Dr. Jared was absolutely wonderful.  I have had dental issues my entire life, and have spent countless hours in the treatment chair.  I've not previously felt so confident and sure that I was in the right hands after leaving that dental chair as I did with Dr. Jared.  If you are considering a switch in dentists or looking for one in your area, please do not hesitate to call and make an appointment.  You will not be sorry!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Love this dental office!  First off, I have the best hygienist I've ever had, I love you Kendra!!  I was never the type to enjoy going to the Dentist, even just for cleanings.   I hate the picking and the scraping, but Kendra makes me as comfortable as possible and is awesome to talk to throughout the process.  I have one tooth in particular, with a receding gum (caused by clenching at night) that is super sensitive and she always makes sure to numb it (topically) and is extra gentle while cleaning it.  It really makes all the difference, because I no longer dread my cleanings.

Then there is Dr. Jared.  He is seriously the friendliest Dentist I've ever met.  I can't say I'll ever understand it, but I am sure glad he loves teeth and smiles as much as he does!  He has a true passion not only for improving your smile and dental health, but also a genuine concern and passion for his patients.  Last year, he did some major work on one of my teeth...a really awkward shaped partial crown, which he had to make twice before he got it perfect (I think he's a bit of a perfectionist!) I was still having pain a few days afterwards and was concerned about it possibly being infected or something. He not only squeezed me in that day to check on everything, he also gave me his personal cell phone number in case it didn't improve over the weekend .  By the way, the work was perfect and there was no infection, just needed a few extra days for the nerves to heal. It feels good to know he and the ladies are always willing to take/make extra time for you when necessary, and I've never felt rushed during any of my appointments.  No matter how many questions you have or how many times he has to come back in and out of the room, he will make the time for you.   And somehow, they always manage to run on time for appointments...can't beat that!

In addition, the office staff has offered for me to bring my toddler in with me during my cleanings so that she can watch and get comfortable with the what goes on at the Dentist's office since she will soon be a patient of his as well.  I'm also going to be having our second baby come fall, which happens to be right at the time my next cleaning is due.  Since I will be a nursing Mom, I was concerned about whether or not I could bring the baby with me during my appointment.  Luckily the office is super family friendly and accommodating.  I know all the ladies will be willing to hold the baby if need be, and I'm happy to say I would be perfectly comfortable with that, because everyone there is great! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Especially if you have a fear of Dentist's like I do....scratch that, DID.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Update 9/2020: Packard dental is still our favorite place for dental work. I’m very picky about who works on my teeth! We currently live overseas and still go to Packard Dental for our dental care. Nicole is one of my favorite hygienists too, very gentle, professional and fun to talk to!<//review>< Pictures>

Straight facts, ready?
Always literally so nice. You kind of forget you’re not at a friend’s house talking to their mom while your friend is out of the room or something, except your lying on your back while someone pokes around in your mouth.
They have TVs on the ceiling. Not in front of you— because you couldn’t see those TVs as you were laying down having work done, so what was he point of them— above you, so while they scrape off the plaque from your bad dental habits you are just watching the cooking channel and wondering hOW DOEA RUDY THINK THAT ICE CREAM IS FOING TO GO HE JUST TOLD US HES NEVER MADE ICE CREAM BEFORE WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU RUDY.
Not very expensive, especially for the service you’re getting. I know our insurance always covers most, if not all of it.
Painless. You feel nothing. I got cavities filled there and I kept waiting for them to start and then they told me they were done.
So also fast. You are in and out for a cleaning in like 45 minutes— and that’s if you’ve been slacking on your brushing like I do and drinking sugary sodas a lot because you have no kitchen so you gotta eat out a lot.</text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I've been going to Packard Dental for years now and I have to say, they are the best!  I see Dr. Jared Packard and he's not only an excellent dentist, very knowledgeable and skilled, but he's also very warm, honest, caring, witty and, as a bonus, can sing beautifully!  I see Janae for cleanings and such and she is by far the best I've ever encountered.  She is very thorough yet somehow magically makes the experience painless.  She is an expert and one of a kind in her field.  Not to mention, a very lovely person.  It's so hard to find a good dentist that isn't going to tell you that you have issues that urgently need to be addressed when in fact that is not the case.  I've had several instances where that happened previously but the Packard Dental group does not do that.  That alone makes them exemplary and the office I would choose, I trust them completely.  But Dr. Jared Packard and Dental Hygienist Janae make the whole experience worthwhile for so many other reasons!  I would highly recommend Packard Dental to anyone!</Text>< pics>

< Review>
I had my appointment today, had x-rays and Melody was very gentle, as sometimes this is very painful for me. Then I met with Dr. Matt. He was really nice, and made me feel at ease. I have very high anxiety, and everyone made me feel comfortable. He was very thorough and explained all the options and laid out a dental plan that gives me hope. The technology is awesome. I had my teeth cleaned by Tiffany. She was wonderful, and we had a nice chat getting to know each other while she cleaned my teeth. She was also very gentle. I really wasn't stressed or anxious by the end. I feel optimistic that the Packard Team will be able to help me with a multitude of issues. The doctors all specialize in different things. One is general and I think cosmetic dentistry, the other is ortho and another is sleep apnea. If you have to find a dentist, I would recommend Packard Dental to anyone. I am looking forward to a brighter smile.</Review>

Kendra Witowich is an awesome person and worker with a great attitude! I would only want her scrapping and digging deep into my mouth because I don't like strangers in my mouth unless they buy me dinner first or at least have met my mother which she hasn't done yet but she is that good and I let her get away with:) Packard Dental is terrific and all of its staff along with it and will always be a place deep in my heart along with my gum lines cause I don't floss as much as I should.I hope this gives you some insight into the mind of one of your customers and lets you know that Kendra Witowich is irreplaceable and needs a huge raise along with months of paid vacation plus a puppy or kitten which ever she decides.

Thanks and cheers!</Text>

<Text>I had my teeth cleaned by Janae yesterday. She did a wonderful job, I love how clean my teeth feel!! Dr. Matt did my exam and as always he never fails at making me feel like I'm being very thoroughly taken care of. Thanks Dr. Matt and Janae!

Update Review 8/20/17: I had my teeth cleaned by Allison. Allison is very thorough, and gentle, and made sure I was comfortable the whole time. She is now using a laser on my gums before my cleaning, and also for my teeth sensitivity. My teeth are much less sensitive from 1 laser treatment, can't wait to get more!< /Text>< user_name>

<review>I've been going to Packard Dental for about 15 years, and have always had a good experience.  Very friendly and professional, extending to all members of the staff.  For a brief period I went to other dentists due to a change in insurance.  I realized how different and better their service was, and had to have the caps received repaired by the Packards.  Can't recommend them enough.
As a bonus Dr. Mark is significantly involved with the community.< /review>< user_id>

While Packard Dental always strives to put patient comfort first, they never omit important information about my personal hygenic habits.  This group lets me know well ahead of time any issues that may or may not come up to stop problem areas before they evolve into a serious condition.  Their personal detication to my well being has saved me stress that I would otherwise find with other groups.  One year later and they continue to provide great service.</review>

I have been here three times now and each time is as good as the last. The staff is friendly and are always playing different music... clasic rock, pop, holiday. I had never had a cavity filled until going here and they have since filled 6! I've heard horror stories of getting cavities filled but Packard makes it easy. I almost look forward to it. They'll make you smile without even doing dental work.</review>

<review>Complete with a friendly, knowledgeable staff, as well as many neat in-office features (flat-screen TV's in every dental area to keep one entertained), Packard Dental truly has it all. I've been coming here for a little over a year now, and the expertise and kindness showcased during all of my visits is unparalleled. The atmosphere is very laid back, and it's overtly apparent that everyone genuinely enjoys their job. It's been a breath of fresh air to have a dentist that is straight-forward and caring of his patients, as well as the quality of his work.<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I have been to many a dentist in my day,but I must say I am a huge Packard Dental fan!. At first I thought the building seemed a little older and wasn't sure what I would find inside, but I have been very pleased. The staff is great and always go out out of their way to make sure you are comfortable. Dr. Matt Packard is my dentist. He is young, smart,skilled on the latest technology,and has amazing technique with needles.( I never feel them.) They can even make you a crown in the same day! I loved that I didn't have to return for a permanent crown and it fit perfectly.The hygenists are excellent as well.Support this local business,and you will be glad you did.</review>

After several bad experiences at dentist offices around Camp Pendleton, I was gratefully referred by a friend to Packard Dental! I remember at my very first visit they went over all my fears & phobias of dental visits; taking everything I said seriously! My dentist's humor, combined with the great attitude of the staff and dental assistants, made going to the dentist more pleasant than it had been for me in years! I refer to them to anyone/everyone I can, because I know what a difference they have made in my dental care! I no longer dread going to the dentist, and I now schedule my next appointments with them right away! Recently the dental hygienist cleaning my teeth, Kendra, was super gentle because I am pregnant and my gums are very sensitive! Just another example of the care and consideration that you will find at Packard Dental! Thank you Packard & staff for the way you have treated me!<//text>

I started coming to this office a few years ago and had a lot of work that I needed done. Not only am I still receiving the same wonderful customer service I received at my very first visit but now I feel like an established member of the packard dental family. <3< /review>

From the moment I walked into their office, I felt welcome. I was greeted and Jill, who I spoke with initially, remembered speaking to me and even though she was on the phone when we first walked in, she said hi when she was finished with her phone call. Great first impression!

We were promptly walked back to our room where Melanie took Jaces X-Rays. This was his first time at the dentist and she did a great job helping him feel at ease.

Dr. Jared was also very friendly and came and said hello while we were waiting for Dr. Matt.

When Dr. Matt arrived to our room, he explained everything step by step and tried to make Jace feel as comfortable as possible through his exam.

Once he was near the end of his exam, he started feeling anxious but got through it, and when he completed his exam, Melanie walked him back to give him a toy, sticker, and sugar free lili-pop, he just loved it!

Very great experience I will always highly recommend Packard family dental.< /Review>

<Text>When I needed my wisdom teeth removed STAT and did not have a dentist (no seen one in years), Packard Dental took care of things immediately. They set me an apt same day, and allowed me to fill out my paperwork online so that my wait time would be shortened being that I was a new patient. They got my x-rays done as soon as I walked in the door, and were not judg-ey to the fact that I had not been seeing a dentist regularly, nor pushy to getting a ton of work done. EVERY SINGLE member of their staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. They genuinely care about their patients and worry more about their happiness and return than anything else. I even got a small bouquet after I got my teeth cleaned! Haha, it was like getting a prize for doing something one would normally dread! And your know what, it encouraged me to start setting up regular cleanings like I am supposed to- because they made what is normally a chore and something that I would put off and avoid, into a fantastic experience. I am 24 years old and never found a dentist firm that I liked enough to consider my "regular dentist", and they just changed that. Oh and did I mention, that they have tv's with cable installed in the ceiling directly above your chair? Yeah- I got handed a direct tv remote and told to go ahead and change it to whatever I wanted while they did their work on my teeth. Fantastic experience. And not a tremendously large price tag for that type of care. Average pricing with amazing care.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I was refered to Packard Dental by a friend about 4yrs ago as a new transplant to Carlsbad, and I could not be any happier! Dr Packard  is the most compasionate and thourough dentist I have ever met. My most recent visit was for a general cleaning by Tiffany who by the way is excellent at her skills. I was concerned about continuous inflamation around my gums, and after problem solving with Tiffany and the Dr, they uncovered that I am allergic to some metals that are part of the crowns I have. This has been a concern of mine for many years, through the care of  many different dentists, but because the Packard Team took the time and listened to me they were able to finally figure it out!  Thank You for keeping my Smile Brite!</Review>

Can't say enough about how good a job Kendra did cleaning my teeth (I like it rough). Plus, the dentist gave me a high five. What's not to like?< /Text>

{'time': 1488910414543, 'text': 'Hi Jason, I am sorry that your initial good experience with Packard Dental wasn’t matched in your most recent experience. We appreciate your feedback. We do our best to estimate your insurance coverage, but dental insurance companies sometimes determine coverage in ways we cannot predict. I am truly sorry that this happened in your case.  No patient wants to be surprised by a bill that is higher than they anticipated or a gap in insurance coverage that they were counting on using as a benefit. It is a frustrating situation for us as well to have insurance companies withhold benefit care to our patients. I look forward to speaking with you personally soon about this and hopefully finding a solution that is acceptable to us both. Thank you for your time in our office and I hope we can earn your patronage again.  Sincerely, Dr. Matt'}<//Resp>

Asked for a plain double cheeseburger. The lady taking the order double checked and made sure I said plain double cheeseburger. And we got a regular California double cheeseburger as they make it. Other food was good and have not had issues before at this location but quite frustrating.<//Review>

We tried the plant-based Beyond burger. The patty was chewier than meat and the taste was slightly different. With that being said it still tasted good. We also had the chicken tenders. The texture was soft and the chicken was fresh but the breading was very salty. My tongue was numb at one point.</text>

<review>Good quick service and juicy burgers!  Big dining room and good location.   I was there on a Saturday afternoon, and it was practically empty.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  Would've liked a better selection of soft drinks, but they cover the basics.  Better than Burger King, overall.</review>< pictures>

<review>Took forever, I went in to try the Beyond Burger as they had a promotion where you bought a drink and got the burger free. Well they couldn't get the promo to work so I paid $8 for the free burger. Staff was nice, and tried to get it to work to no avail. If your running a promo you better be sure it works!< /review><userid>113531954772540882044<//userid>< gmap_id>

Service was decent if easily confounded, but it's easy to underestimate how much they provide with the Chicken Tenders and overestimate how much milk they provide per order. Also, YouTube needs to suck less by not hiding behind deliberately obstructive security.<//review>

<review>Workers are either blind, deaf, or both. I feel sorry for the manager of this location.

1. A few months ago: Drive thru - Ordered Double Western Bacon Burger with NO CHEESE and waffle fries
[came with cheese that was melted onto beef patties, waffle fry box half empty]

2. A month ago: Drive thru - Ordered Famous Star with NO CHEESE [came with cold slice of cheese]

3. Less than a month ago: DoorDash - Ordered a Double Western Bacon Burger with NO CHEESE, Chicken tenders, and waffle fries [came with two slices of cheese]

4. Today: DoorDash - Ordered a double hamburger (hamburgers are called hamburgers because they are cheeseburgers without the cheese, right?),m and decided to write NO CHEESE on order specifications just in case, with two sides of waffle fries [you can guess what happened - very similar to the first order]< /review><user_name>Vincent Goh</user_name><GmapID>0x808f79e80c977337:0x1587bdc6d6973077<//GmapID>< response>

I had to leave after 5 minutes of being ignored by the manager! A bold guy on red shirt taking orders with a mic! I couldn’t drive through cause of the clearance, Came out and there were barely 2 cars waiting for orders so I Didn’t really get it! :(< /text>

Picked up an egg and bacon burrito at 6:10 AM and it was surprisingly good. The burrito was not as full as I would have liked, but still satisfying. Coffee was unexpectedly fresh and tasty. Staff was friendly and quick, restaurant was clean and well lit. Will return next time I've the craving for an egg and bacon burrito!< /Review>

<review>Love the food here, the workers are very kind and actually pretty funny. They take the time to get to know the customers. It gets annoying that they're cash only but its still an amazing joint. The combo is to die for, the way they prepare it makes my mouth water every single time.<//review><name>Pete Quinn</name>< Gmap_id>

It is a great restaurant. I only go there on weekends and since it's almost always empty, it's nice.< /Review>

Horrible sercive worst service I’ve ever come across!!  Go any where but here! Worst quality and service. Screwed up my family’s order not once but three times. I had to ask 4 times to get my large cup for my meal then told me I had to pay additional. Charge me out wrong twice and didn’t get me my full meal. Ended up having to leave with out my full meal and now my son won’t get anything. I’m beyond pissed. He was so rude when I was telling him my order.</Text>

"At least my order will be fresh, cooked to order," I thought - wrong. Both items were stale, lukewarm, and dried out. The server gave me one dipping sauce for both items; I had to ask for another. What a disappointment. I won't be back. I wasted close to $7, on food that was barely edible.</text>< user_id>

<Review>The Holidays are rough as it is, and Ive recently had some deep personal tragic backstory type stuff happen in my world and honestly, when I finally got my appetite back I wanted comfort food. I wanted what I got as a kid, western with extra bar be que sauce, bacon, and onion rings. I wanted a chocolate milkshake and onion rings on the side.

This is a Big Deal. I havent had an appetite in a while.

The drive through speaker box wasnt working, so the heavy black man who was working that drive thru on sunday december 4th kept yelling at me to scream my order into the box. Finally i decided I didnt feel like screaming and decided to pull forward.

I have no idea how my front driver tire ended up bursting in their drive thru: he told me i was "speeding" but i never really touched the acceleration. I must have hit the curb at just the right angle, or there was something in the drive thru, because my tire popped.

This is all random and weird. The messed up part was when this same order taker peeked out the window and started making snide remarks at me.

I pulled forward into a spot and went inside. I hadnt felt like screaming into a speaker, but I definitely felt like the basic human decency that should be afforded was missing. The staff was unfriendly and cruel about my tire on my 2013 ford fusion bursting in their drive thru.

I no longer feel like eating at Carls Jr. It was a comfort food, but this location may have put me off of my appetite forever.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Jijime is one of our favorite restaurants in San Francisco. The ramen is exquisite, boneless chicken (honey butter) to die for, wide selection of good beers, amazing service, mellow atmosphere (they often play bossa nova in the restaurant, it's awesome), all perfect. I can’t imagine a better way to spend a rainy weeknight then cozying up with a warm Tonkotsu ramen from Jijime. The most solid of choices for a casual night out for dinner.<//review>< pics>

Sssssoooo good!!! The food here was so tasty!  It was very filling as well with their good portion sizes.  The food came out hot and the spices were amazing from the second it hits your tongue to the long great after taste.  The prices are good and I would for sure bring a date here.< /review>

I really wanted to try this place since I saw their great deals for sake. Inside is really cute and clean. It is a bit small, but not crowded. We were seated immediately.

We ordered the short ribs, okonomiyaki fries, two beef bibimbap, and the chicken jjim. Of all the dishes, the chicken jjim was our favorite. The chicken and noodles were super tasty. The sauce went well with the bibimbap. I loved the fries and would highly recommend those for an appetizer. The short ribs were a great deal too. I think one downside was that there were no sides/banchan, but that's okay!

I loved this place and definitely plan to visit again soon. They have a great happy hour discount on sake. Their menu is pretty extensive and have a great selection of small plates. They're also doing take out for quarantine!<//Text>

There is no room to stand, as the facility is small, so we had to wait outside, but then we didn’t receive notification that a table was available, so we had to ask again for one. After ordering, it took a while for the food to arrive, likely due to the small number of staff. The food itself was underwhelming, as it did not have much flavour without the sauce. The place is attractive and has a nice atmosphere, but overall, my expectations were not met.</review><Date>1596005475979< /Date></record>

It's been awhile since I gave a 5 star review but this little hidden gem sure deserved it. I saw this fairly new place a week ago while running errands and stopped by for lunch with a friend today.
Since the menu classified the starters as tapas, we were going to order a few and then share a ramen or a sizzling bibimbab. The tapas were large in portions and we couldn't even finish the 4 we order. We thought we were done till they brought out the dessert menu.

Seafood Jeon $6.50
Korean savory pancake with mixed seafood
5* This was one of the best dishes, 2 small pancakes perfectly cooked. Crispy and tender at the same time.

Boneless Fried Chicken (spicy or soy garlic) $7.50
Bite size Korean style crispy boneless chicken with your choice of flavor
5* Another hit, chicken was cooked to perfection and the sauce was perfectly seasoned.

Popcorn Salmon $6
Bite size fried salmon with spicy
4* The salmon was just slightly overcooked for my liking but still divine.

Corn Cheese $6
Corn with creamy sauce and cheese on sizzling pan
3* This was average, nothing spectacular. Next time we will order the slicked beef salad instead.

I forgot to take a picture of the dessert, the Mango Panna Cotta was definetly a nice touch to end a delicious meal. I gave this restaurant 5 stars because the waitstaff was excellent. Great service with a smile!<//Text>

Impressive Korean and Asian foods. The price is not so high and the foods offered are very much worthy. Good for heavy meals as well as snack items. Drinks were also impressive, looks very delicious for its smell and colors. I am gonna make more visits here.< /Text>

My husband and I came in here after just walking around the area looking for someplace to eat. first we visited Bluefin to only find out that they open at 5 p.m. so that was a bummer, then we went to Gordo's and discovered that they only had meat for their burritos so that was a no-go. (We are pescatarian-vegan.)
Then we happen to walk across the street from Gordo's just a few feet from the stop light, and stumbled onto Jijime.

What really grabbed us was the happy hour! visit their Instagram for pics of their food!!!! Tell me to my face that food dont look good, and ill tell you, you a muhfuh lie😂!!!!!!
the happy hour menu, I mean just for the sake and the beer alone I was in static shock. Then we looked at their tapas menu; It was everything we could ask for!
I mean everything we were able to have, delicious sake wine beer cocktails and small-plates that my husband and I were able to share at a very very very reasonable rate.

My husband and I are native San Franciscans! this is what we live for, in our city, to find those hidden gems and this is a city hidden Gem. If you want some happy hour eats from 3 to 6 p.m. please come here and see Hannah shout out to you Hannah because you were very sweet and you served us very well and we were very pleased, you, the cooks, and the food are the reason we are coming back!
PSA: to the vegans of San Francisco. Look no more they have a vegan and vegetarian option for their bebambib 😱. Your Welcome 😏.
Now I am going to show you below a before pic and there is no after pic because, in the words of my husband,

"WE TOOK THAT DOWN!!!"

And shout out to the cooks! They threw down! I feel so good after eating their food. The freshness! The ambiance. It was cozy and modern and quaint! Definitely will become a regular!!!!
See Ya'll Soon!!!</Text>

Love this place.  Such tasty small plates and so filling!  The flavors are exceptional and very reasonable prices.  Wait staff are friendly and so far, we've been able to be seated quickly.  It's becoming a favorite pit stop for delicious snacks! Tried the ramen once before and that was also very tasty.< /review>

<review>Maybe I shouldn't get a ramen at a Korean fusion place? The broth and ramen are good, although nothing spectacular. But the pork is dry and plain. This is the only dish I got, therefore three stars. Fast service.< /review>< pictures>

This place is great. We loved the soy garlic chicken, eel and curry katsu. Every dish was absolutely delicious, as well as the service. Chris was our server and was so helpful. Look forward to coming back again.<//Text>

Jijime's Korean - Asian fusion - Ramen flavors and textures are not for me. The Black Garlic Ramen $12.99 was sandy/gritty from the black garlic. It felt like I was eating bits of charcoal in most of my bites. It was bitter and off-putting for me. I thought I would like it because I enjoy garlic and black garlic and lots of reviews mentioned liking the dish.

I didn't like the flavor of the crispy fried seaweed roll. The spicy boneless chicken was soggy. The popcorn potstickers were okay.</text>

<text>Sizzling Bibimbap ingredients were very underwhelming. Big slices of lettuce and bell peppers. Tryout plates/bowls options instead. Had the ramen with housemade garlic oil. Broth was good. The ramen is comparable to ramen used in instant ramen. Underwhelming.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<review>The concept is excellent. I’ve always wished I could get small plates of Korean food. And even the flavors here are great. The problem is it tastes like too many dishes are pre-made rather than freshly made. So, fried things aren’t crispy enough, the pancake was a bit soggy and not hot enough. And I could see the guy behind the bar microwaving things. I’d love to see them modify their food prep so I could enjoy this place and give it a better rating.</review></record>

Very cute Korean Fusion place with a variety of Korean inspired and other Asian dishes. Not a BBQ place with banchan side dishes but tasty choices nonetheless. Kind of dark inside, with trendy decor. Good selection of beer. Waiter was super sweet and pretty attentive despite being the only server. Kimchi is very tasty but quite spicy, can't beat the price at $1.<//text>

<Review>Stopped in after seeing a recommendation from a friend and plenty of good reviews on here. I wanted to try the katsu-don but when I asked the waitress about it she said they could not make it that evening...so I decided to order the bulgogi bowl and some okonomiyaki fries.

I didn't expect the okonomiyaki fries ($6) to be good but actually they were excellent. The fries had a McDonald's like texture but gourmet with kewpie mayo and katsu sauce finished with bonito flakes on top. Excellent.

Then the bulgogi bowl ($12.95) appeared. This bowl was a sad bulgogi bowl with disappointing small slices of meat that tasted like every Korean AYCE BBQ place I've ever been to. There was tons of green salad (with no dressing) and rice that filled the whole bowl probably at least 80% of the bowl with some clear noodles.

I would much rather pay more and have good bulgogi than pay less and have a disappointing experience. The bulgogi marinade was also super sweet, acid reflux inducing...overall just not good. I would not order it again.

The ambiance is nice here and its a good place to go with friends and maybe order some tapas, but if you really love Korean food you might find yourself disappointed at Jijime.<//Review><user_name>Carlos Hernandez</user_name><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rate>

<review>I have never seen a "soft opening" that was so smooth and excellent as Jijime's - they got everything right from the get-go:

- A varied menu, authentically Korean but fitting every possible palate
- Low prices, $5 for "Small Bites" (which are really fun), $10-14 for (big) entrées
- The place looks both elegant and homey, lighting, decor first-class, the music is set right, providing background, not interfering with conversations
- Service is exceptional, both genuinely friendly and responding to every need

In just a week, Jijime became a habit.

The only "however" is that this is not the kind of Korean restaurant where you get a dozen small dishes to start with. For that, go to Han Il Kwan, two blocks away from Jijime, at 19th and Balboa.</review>< Pictures>

Did not enjoy my food. They are super cheap with they’re ingredients. I ordered a quesadilla and it has a sprinkle of cheese. Staff is also not very friendly kind of simple and rude. I would not recommend this place.</Text>

My first time at this fruit place today. I ordered the turkey torta and it was very delicious. Although I would had preferred if they left the turkey meat cold. I will definitely go back to try the rest of the menu.< /Review>

I did business with them and they never returned the money they promised me back. I believed the owner 100% but they stole my money! SMH the more money you have the greedier you become. Not only did he stop answering my messages & phone calls after they asked for some advice. And the only reason why I’m posting here is to get there attention and hopefully get my money back! What’s rightfully mine!< /Review>

<Text>I used to really enjoy this place. After going a lot I noticed the quality isn't doesn't justify the price. It's family owned and small business,  so I would think they would be a little more welcoming and friendly,  but that's not really the case. I stopped going for a while and decided to come in today and now they charge 25c per extra sauce after two. Rubios  doesn't even charge for salsa.

This is probably the most tasteless, flavorless Mexican food I have had in San Diego.  The veggie burrito consisted of some dry rice, beans, tomatoes, and about a pound of lettuce.  For almost $10 with tax for a burrito, you would think they could at least cook some veggies to put inside or put some cheese or sour cream so that the burrito was not just dry and overly crunchy from so much lettuce.  They also don't offer any type of condiment bar like almost every other Mexican food place has.  They don't offer lemons, limes, various hot sauces, jalapenos, onions or spicy carrots.  So there is nothing to add any flavor to their flavorless lettuce burrito.< /text>

Drinks are purchased by the can, bottle or they have smoothies. No fountain drinks. The food was fresh and service good. We will be back. To add a note they are located in the middle of the shopping center.< /text>< pics>

<review>I have been in here waiting over 20 minutes for 2 tostadas, that will more than likely will not be how i ordered them. I will NOT be back here even though its so close to my house. Stop taking orders and take care of your paying customers.

Just disappointed cause They don't have a bathroom for their own customer to use. Well, that's what i was told by the cashier.  I had to go to the supermarket nextdoor to use the restroom.

<rate>4< /rate><Resp>None< /Resp><review>This is a great place to go for fresh food. For the vegetarian or vegan there are fantastic options without being relegated to a kids' menu. Outside of the lunch hour the wait is reasonable. My only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the ambiance. It's reminiscent of a food court. Not a gross one, but not a fancy one to be sure.</review><user>101138868544274684498</user><Name>Ben Hubers<//Name>< Time>

<review>I went there Monday night to get a chicken baja burrito. I'm giving three stars only because the burrito was good but the customer service was far below par.  The short hispanic woman that was there was more concerned with the conversation with her cooks than paying attention to her customers. She called my order out and I'm sure that she's been there for a while so she knows the procedure and she still forgot to give me the chips that come with the order. After she put them on my plate I said thank you but she stayed silent. It looked like she didn't want to be there. The floor was dirty with crumbs of chips and other things. The place was not busy. There were about three other customers so not sure why it was dirty. I've been coming to this place for many years but today this place was probably the worst I've seen it. I hope she gets her act together. Besides that the food is actually always been pretty good. Hope to come back again soon.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

The food was good, however their customer service was not the best experience. As I was ordering I asked the cashier if my combo came with a drink, given that it was my first time there and she rudely responded "NO, and that i can get that in Mc Donald's but not there"
I understand that they were probably busy and that things can get frustrating (given that I also worked in customer service) but the way she responded was unnecessary. Overall the food was good.<//Text>

<Review>Used to love baja fresh, but with their increase in prices, I'm turned off. My signature dish was a bean and cheese burrito with a side of rich and beans. Prices are up at least 40% and my cheese wasn't even melted in my burrito. There wasn't any pickled jalapenos at the salsa bar. Baja be slippin'< /Review>< pics>

Great!  Mild chicken burrito is awesome.
The pickled red onions and corn are the ingredients that make the burrito zing.
Please stock up on Baja Fresh Mexican Grill.

Suggestion:  Substitute tortillas for chips -- less fat.<//review>

Forget Salmonella CHIPOTLE!! This was is always clean, talking with the workers you learn they also love the food and it's a sign of quality.
Guac was also fresh with the right seasoning.
No complaints and the prices are not OVERPRICED CHIPOTLE STYLE.
I just wish someone invested on them to open locations in different states. I guess happy workers make happy food.< /Text>

Looking for decent mexican food then you've found the place. It's not authentic so don't expect anything special. But if you're looking for one of the biggest burritos of your life order the burrito dos manos! Good luck if you can finish it all.</Review>

I love this location, it's a short walk from the beach and has free parking out back.
The people who work here are always super sweet, they always offer to help me take my tray to the table or bring me extra pico/chips/drink... but I'm always toting my cute baby, so that could be why!:)
Most of this location has window seating, so it's nice to people watch and eat. I always get the Chicken Ensalada, it gigantic! Get it without chips and it's under 280 calories and can be split into 2 meals:)</Review>

Rating based primarily on their outstanding beer selection! Don't get me wrong - the pizza is great too - but this place has a fantastic selection of excellent local brews both on-tap and by the can. It's a pretty small patio (they've done what they could to maximize, including putting a big screen TV out there) so we often just pick up cans and take them home. Favorite pizzas include the Green with Envy and the Railroad Grade.<//Text>

Good grub, great beer selection, cool people.  20 taps!  Went in with my two boys, 13 and 16, after we ate ended up staying for an hour and a half playing trivial pursuit. They have games there.  Lots of sports, locals get in here for a casual beer.  Patio area a great place to sit if you bring your dog.  Been going there for 5+ years.</Review>

<review>We're happy to have Extreme right in our backyard! They have great beers on tap, the pizzas are delicious and they have a good selection of salads as well. We love to bring our dog and sit on the patio with a beer and listen to the classic rock that is often playing. Its a comfortable place to hang out.<//review></record>

Cashier ignored us, was on his cell phone texting while taking our order.

They brought out our food after the rest of our party had received their pizza about 20 minutes before. We all ordered at exactly the same time.

Pizza and beer were good. No complaints regarding the food. Service gets -3 stars.< /review>

<pics>None<//pics><review>I ordered a vegan cheese pizza with garlic, nice and simple. The garlic was on the burnt side, but regardless it was still good. What I enjoyed most was the friendly staff. I believe the woman I spoke with was the manager. I enjoyed talking to her while I waited for my pick up order. They have a large menu, so there are lots of options. I came here because they had vegan cheese and I appreciated the vegan menu options even though I was getting something so simple.</review><date>1503636598986</date>< response>

**New Ownership** The beers are still great, but pizzas are now coming out overcooked with very tough crusts, thin toppings and the sauce tastes watered-down. I talked to the new owners since my wife and I have visited this location frequently for 6 years. They assured me that the pizza was the same as it has always been. I can assure you that it is not. I don't know if this is a form of cost cutting, but people will notice.<//Text>

Kickin' Chicken Pizza, which can be a bit spicy, and the chicken parm monster subs are great choices at this Extreme location. They also offer gluten free crusts and vegan cheese. The lunch specials are from 11 am to 2 pm. Watch some tv while you wait for your food.<//Review>

<Review>This place is phenomenal!  Although they deliver, we usually drive down to their Alamo location to pick the pizza up ourselves.  Pizza is fairly thin, and is really light and crispy.

Overall, favorite pizza place in the Alamo/Danville area!< /Review>< Pictures>

If you like thin crust pizza it is pretty good. They also have gluten free, dairy free options.<//review>

Decent pizza, but seems dirty and has all the charm of a school cafeteria.  Talk about phoning it in.</Review>

<text>Good pizza, but ask for anything "non standard" and its all downhill from there. We came in and ordered a slice of cheese for my daughter to enjoy there, with a sandwich and calzone ordered to go, ong with two beers to have while we waited. Pizza came out fine, but shory after, the calzone and sandwich came out, on.plates. not to go as requested. Not happy. Yhen we got home, and the sandwich, which was specifically ordered with no onions due to allergies, was absolutely COVERED in onions. What's so difficult about leaving off the onions? Makes me crazy that a couple teenagers can't get get something so simple, right. Geez.</text><Gmap_id>0x808f8b03edbf0ef3:0x2a0e480e4c20be9<//Gmap_id>< userid>

<review>I wanted a bike for health and cruising.  Not sure what I was walking into.  I was overwhelmed and almost ready to walk away. Then Parker stepped into the picture.

I went in after getting a recommendation to check out this place from a random independent merchant in Santee Alley.   After knowing what my spending limits for a bicycle were I was able to purchase a beautiful 21 speed Giant Roam bike.  This fit my plans perfectly.  And they even thru in a free kickstand and adjusted it to fit my height.   After riding it around I have had several compliments and jealous remarks from other Road and Mountain bike enthusiasts.   I feel that I got a great deal and made a good decision to enter this store.<//Review>

<Review>I've had work done on a few bikes here and the mechanic work has been good. Not giving 5 stars for a couple reasons. When ordering an item or getting bike work done, they don't call to let you know your stuff is ready, you gotta call, even tho they say they're gonna call you. Also, got a tune up there and asked for a new crank setup, we agreed on a price and when I picked up my bike they had added a derailleur to make the new setup work. Obv it needed to be done but they didn't call to give me a heads up on the extra part/charge.
The mechanic work done on my bike was good and I'm happy with it, and the workers are always nice and generally helpful. Their customer service/communication is not great, I would say.</Review><Rating>4<//Rating><Response>{'time': 1614215277923, 'text': 'Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention, Brenda.

<rate>5<//rate><text>I have been a customer of JRLA for a long time and they never disappoint. The staff are great and friendly. Ask them questions about where to go ride your bicycle and they will tell you where to go to get away from traffic. They have a variety of products for your bicycle and different prices. Their stock on bicycles is very good considering the low inventory in many bike shops now. Follow them in Instagram and send them a DM thru the app, they will respond fast and they don't mind responding to the many questions you could send. Believe me, after reading my history of messages I was annoyed by me and they received me in the store very warmly.
BTW, thank you for your services, I am enjoying the bike I recently got from you.<//text><date>1616692212856< /date><name>Edwin Salgado< /name>< gmap_id>

Great store with fantastic staff. Clearly they love active sports and SB really makes great use of this passion. I wanted to really compliment Isabella (I think I have that right) for excellent product knowledge and ability to get my needs quickly. She gently inquired about my knowledge level and adjusted her spiel to my level of knowledge interest. You can't ask for more.  Happy to spend my money at this fine store. The fact that they are so active in our community is just a big ol' bonus.</Review>

<Review>I have been eyeing getting a foldable bike for awhile. During Covid, its been hit or miss with stores actually having them in stock. After waiting for a few months, I decided to just do it. I live in the valley but wanted to try Just Just Ride LA due to all the great things Ive heard. I wasn't disappointed. Even though I had my 6yo son with me, sales associate Parker was still very detailed and patient and took time to answer all of my questions and concerns. Id recommend JustRideLA to anyone!! #Dahon</Review>< Pictures>

Very helpful ppl. They were able to fix my bike quickly, needed a new tube and patch up the wheels and only charged for labor. They are very receptive to your needs if you speak to the owner and the repair man in back in Spanish. Thanks again.</Text>

<review>Great experience! I'd reserved my road bike for the Escape from Alcatraz online and provided my specs (both processes really easy). In the background, team identified a potential problem in the sizing I'd provided. When I arrived, in spite of being busy (on account of the race) my bike was ready as planned and they moved quickly to swap it for a better size.</review><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Bought expensive ebike, it was assembled when I arrived.....after reading thru the owners manual...only via app, I discovered parts were missing. A day after I bought the bike they say they dont work with ebike company and I'll have to contact the company directly to have parts work done on the bike.....BS!! Find another shop, this one is IN THE HOOD!! Homeless everywhere and parking non-existent. Bike was listed OVER the companies list price....beware of gouging here too!!< /text>

UPDATE;
I want to say the staff are nice, but I felt like I got ripped off. I took in my electric  bike for a tune up and I was told it was $90 then they called me to tell me is $120. I said okay when I went back to pick it up, it was making a high pitch sound ( it didn’t have this noise before I took it in) when I press on the brakes, so I took it back and they said my brake pads were worn off and charged me extra $20 to get it replaced. They should’ve told me this in advanced when they did the tune up. The manager Reached out to me to apologize which I really appreciated. He was very attentive and asked about what happened and what he can do to fix it. He listened to my concerns and I thought that was great<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Let me just say that... THIS PLACE IS AMAZING !! I was greeted promptly by a well mannered and knowledgeable gentleman named Juan. Absolutely charming guy! The whole staff is excellent! But going back to Juan. I told him what I was looking for (type of bike/price range) and acted with no hesitation to show me what he KNEW I’d want. The wide array of bike options were displayed marvelously! The prices are pretty fair, they offer payment plans on approved credit, as well as a 3 month (max) layaway! Test driving was also an option! There was no rushing of any kind. After purchasing my bike, they filled the tires and inspected it for any issues. Great team that knows what they’re doing and are very careful, not only in handling the bikes, but also handling each customer with the upmost respect and good intent. Highly recommend this shop for any of your bike wants and needs. Keep up the amazing work ladies and gents of Just Ride L.A. !!!< /text>< Pictures>

I walked in not knowing anything about bikes or what I was even looking for, but walked away educated with the right bike that fit my needs.

I purchased some upgraded tires for my ebike.  I inquired the cost of installation.  Just Ride was less than half of the quotes I received from other bike shops.  Customer service was more than excellent.  They have all kinds of bikes in stock from ebikes to fixies along with accesories.  This will be my go to bike shop.< /Text>

My husband had custom ordered a Brompton bike that was set to be delivered to the store. Juan was so incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about everything. We ended up getting myself a bike, as well as a trailer for our kids, and a bike rack for the car. Juan and the team showed us how to properly install and use all of the features on our items and were incredibly patient with us while we had two energetic toddlers run throughout the store. We definitely recommend this store, and especially Juan, who will answer every question you may have.< /review>

I had the worse experience. I won’t even go into details. However they have integrity issues, they don’t take responsibility when a mistake is made, and to guarantee your business they will quote a price and time frame of completion with no intention in honoring it, there words are useless... They definitely left a bad tase in my mouth.  THUMBS DOWN!!!!!!!!!</Text>

I walked in with a part for my trainer that wouldn't fit my bike. He knew the problem right away and said I could come back if I needed help fitting to to my bike. I came back with both of my bikes and they set everything up for me!! I was able to order everything else I needed and they made sure that it would fit my bikes. They are a wealth of knowledge that I would have never known if I bought online.

I took my bike to have a rear oil brake fixed, but Juan explained to me that my bike needed a full service.  I accepted his comment only that I asked him to please keep all the parts that would be changed to my bike. Juan told me that it was good that I returned in a week because they did not have the same parts that my bike occupies.  I came back in the week he told me and my bike was not ready yet.  My bike was held for almost 4 weeks, apart from spending almost $ 1,300 dollars, my bike was in poor condition.  # 1 my wheels had tubless fluid and I asked them to change the tires and put new fluid on it and juan said that my wheels were bad that they couldn't put fluid on it.  # 2 the rear brake was fixed but the front one started with the same problem, christian the mechanic told me that juan knew what was going to happen and said nothing, juan wanted me to invest more money in my bike when he had not been able to fix it.  # 3 I never received my old parts that I asked to be saved.  Conclusion I do not think it is the right place to take bikes to fix them, maybe they have very nice new bikes but the service is not good.  Now my bike is unable to use because the brake does not work and I do not know who to trust to fix my bike.<//review>

{'time': 1580687882457, 'text': 'Hey Sangwon, thanks for stoping by. We take pride in our top notch service department. When pricing comes in to place for wheel trues it’s based on the complexity of your wheel, material, how out of alignment they’re along with our time. Our wheel alignment rates start at $15 and go up to about $35, professional service comes with a slightly higher price.'}</Response>
<pictures>None</pictures><review>They asked me for a flat fee of $35 to true one wheel, without taking a very close look. That seems very high -- I think bike shops normally quote 15~20, and 25 at the highest.

Edit: I went to another reputable bike shop and got the job done for $15. If you want to get reasonable rates, *shop around*. This place takes one look at you and your bike, sizes you up, and "gambles" i.e. tries a high quote on you because you look like you'll pay for it on the spot. This is the worst type of repair shop, whether it's an auto repair shop or a bike shop. I remember that while I was hesitating because $35 seemed high, one of the technicians suggested buying a new wheel ("Another option is to buy a new wheel, like this one here (points to a completely different type of second-hand wheel hanging from the ceiling) it's not going to be the same color, but it'll definitely be safe". Why would I buy a new wheel?</review>< GmapID>

I came into the shop last month looking for a solid bike for daily commute. This is a family run business, and the brothers were super helpful right from the start. They helped me decide which bike was best, and as someone relatively new to biking, they gave me great advice. My whole experience was awesome, we even took a picture for Instagram before my brother and I left! I'll be heading back into the shop for the free first-month bike tune-up they offer, and I'm really looking forward to it.</text>

Just Ride L.A. dialed my body measurements onto both road bike and track bike with awesome bike fit service. Super easy process, the guy was cool and is certified on bike-fitting. From that, I gained strength, speed, & feel comfortable enough to ride for long distances without discomforts like neck pain, over- extending reach on handlebars, or my butt feeling numb LOL. Another amazing quality service is the tune-up leaving your bicycle factory clean  Seriously, this shop will accommodate you & especially know how to treat your bike! Thanks JRLA staff!< /Review>

Bikes, Boards, Scooters, and MORE!

I came here to buy my OneWheel XR. They were able to show me E-Bikes and Electric Boards. Not only did they have everything I wanted to see... they had more. I was able to spec out an electric kit for my existing bike, save money, and I bought the OneWheel I came in looking for! OneWheel Accessories? Yup. They have them and can order whatever they don't stock.

Don't waste your time searching around. This is your one-stop shop.< /Text>

I called the store all he said was I got a incoming call so bye and I can’t do anything about it “bro” so unprofessional.

<Text>This bike shop is amazing.  I can't say enough good things about how much Christian took care of me and my bike!  Christian really took his time with me and gave me great advice. I could tell he truly cared about my safety and happiness. My new electric bike was shipped to a bike store in Santa Monica for assembly and after just two rides the fenders were loose and falling, the attached light had come off, and the brakes weren't quite right. They did a great job at Just Ride LA getting me going again and I got a great basket there, too. I am so glad I found this place and the cool people who work there.  Christian, Danny and Ezekial were just the best. Everybody working there contributed to a really good experience. I highly recommend this shop! Cool peeps that take great care of you! :)</Text>< rate>

<Text>This was my second visit here. Last time, I bought my bike, pedals, lights, shoes, etc., and this time some new tires. The guys at Just Ride are fantastic. They are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. They really take their time to make sure you get the best possible service and ensure you are happy with your purchase. I've been to several other bike shops and none of them genuinely compare to Just Ride in terms of service quality. Can't recommend this place enough.< /Text>< Name>

I like my bike and the rest of the gear (lights, lock and helmet) that I got at Just Ride, but it was like pulling teeth to get the sales person to talk to me about the accessories while my bike was being set up by the mechanic.

The stock of large frames was very lacking for me and my partner had an even harder time trying to find a small frame during the same visit.

A couple weeks after getting said bike, my shifters stopped working. I managed to get my chain back on and get to work as a fixie. When I took the bike into a different shop closer to my office on my way home, they told me the issue was because the shifter had been installed waaaaaaay too high on the frame; after getting that addressed (and several other minor adjustments which probably would have been covered in the "free adjustments" offered by Just Ride), the bike has ridden much more smoothly.<//text>

<Review>I took in a 15-year old bike that was given to me that was basically put together with various parts over the years.  I only use my bike 3-4 times a week for very short trips, but I wanted to make it ride better.  Daniel (the owner) listened to my needs, fine-turned the bike and replaced a chain. For $50.00 it rides like new.  I was so impressed I sent my nephew there and he bought a new bike and loves it.  They have bikes in all price ranges for every level of cyclist.  I've been back to buy a bike lock, basket and other accessories.  Everyone in the store is friendly and knowledgeable.  I can't imagine going anywhere else.</Review>< pics>

The staff at Just Ride LA are fantastic. They were the most helpful, understanding and reasonably-priced bike shop to disassemble two bikes for shipping across the country (my partner and I called at least five other bike shops in the area). The staff handled our time-sensitive request on the same day, printed out our shipping labels for us and let us leave our boxes for FedEx to pick them up from the shop. They even gave us free cold water bottles! We could enjoy our stay in LA and know that our bikes were in good hands. Thanks, Just Ride LA!<//review>

I went in to get my bike serviced for the issue observed during changing of gears. The service representative "Cripson" could rectify the issue immediately. He also provided few guidelines on maintaining my bike. I highly recommend this place because of service representatives like Cripson who could make their customers happy :-) :-) Good and quick service.</review>

Since getting my first bike from Just Ride LA, I have become a regular customer. They always provide great service and are patient/willing to help find the perfect bike for you. I've upgraded my bicycle 3 different times with them already and always go back for tune ups/if I need any parts. The staff here is very knowledgeable and I trust my bike with no one else. They have also started doing bike fits, an amazing and unique service that really makes you feel like you are one with your bicycle. I don't understand the negative reviews/complaints because I have never had any issues with the team/service here and cannot recommend this shop enough.< /text>

I just don't see how a pet store would be successful if it made you leave your dog outside. It's a shame because I'm in the market for a bike and I was looking to drive between 12 and 1800 bucks, at this particular location. DTLA bijes here i come.</Text>< time>

I just bought a beautiful used hybrid bike from Just Ride LA yesterday. Danny was accommodating of my student status on a budget and gave me a sweet deal on the bike and a sturdy U-lock. They opened the U-lock package and let me know of all the additional parts and mounted it onto the bike. I really recommend this place for good service and a variety of selections.<//text>

<date>1559856280007</date><rating>1<//rating><Text>Hi Just Ride Team,

I bought my Evolve GTX Bamboo 4/30 to one of your branch store “Just Ride” in LA on their stocks (not special order). But after I bought it the same day I heard the new Evolve Series is coming. So I tried not to open the box and planned to return.  So I went back to return the board on the 3rd Day after buying it. I was very surprised when the manager told me that I could not return the board. I said I just bought this 3 days ago and never open, but the guy manager still insisted no returns.

After this, I started reading the return policy, and it said I can return the product within 14 days of purchase, with sales receipt, with unopened box, and if opened they will charge 25% stock fee. I said this never been opened and way less than 14 days, but they still refused to accept my return and they told me that if I want to return the board, they will charge me 25%. So I was really surprise and I called the other manager. I kindly explained, and he said he will get back to me. Later, he said the same thing but he had another option, saying that I can return the Evolve GTX but I will not get my money back. Instead, they will give me store credit for me, saying I can get the new one once it is released then they can order it for me.

I thought that it was maybe a good option, although I have never done it before and I was not comfortable doing that, so I decided not to accept it. I still believed that they should accept my return, so I waited a little longer and maybe they will change their mind and come back to me. They came back and said that maybe I can try the Evolve manufacturer.

Personally, I don’t think you, Evolve, will accept the return. I did not buy it directly from you guys, so why would you accept the return? Maybe you will accept the repair warranty, but not the sales return. I told them my reasoning and thought but the manager told me to try.

I left the store and told them in a calm and professional manner that I will never buy any of their stuff ever again and I promised them I will give them a very good review. So I left after I said that without any response from them.

I just bought a beautiful used hybrid bike from Just Ride LA yesterday. Danny was accommodating of my student status on a budget and gave me a sweet deal on the bike and a sturdy U-lock. They opened the U-lock package and let me know of all the additional parts and mounted it onto the bike. I really recommend this place for good service and a variety of selections.<//review>

Been a customer here for a little over 4 years and I'm happy to have seen them grow from the little place they used to have. Great service all the time and a big shout out to Christian for the bike fit!. My rides just got more exciting due to my comfort on the bike.<//text>

After calling the shop twice and visiting twice, I quickly realized this was the perfect place for all your bike needs. Staff is great, ready to help and willing to answer questions patiently, which was a huge deal for me on the fact that this needed to be a carefully thought out purchase (special shoutouts to Juan and Danny!). Not only did they answer my questions, but Juan was great at making sure all my needs were addressed from picking the right Brompton, to the payment process, and aftercare procedures. He was very clear on payment options and checking to make sure my plan was right for me. I never felt pressured at the shop to buy anything, which is awesome. It was also nice to be able to test ride the bikes.

I bought a bike for life and I'm glad I did it here! Looking forward to bringing my bike here in the future for upkeep and other goodies.< /review><UserId.>118156341356104158183<//UserId.></record>

Just Ride La is a great place to buy a bike but i would not recommend buying parts for a bike unless any other shop doesn't have them. Just Ride La's parts are heavily overpriced and they have a huge labor charge. For example i bought some new bar tape for $12 but they charged a $20 fee to put it on. So i decided to go to another local shop and they did it for $3 with is about 6x less than Just Ride.</review>

< Review>
This place sucks. They just care about making $$$ and dont care about helping you out with your bike. I went in the other day to buy a few upgrades for my bike. I took my bike with me so i could make sure the items fit. When i went inside the store i was told to leave my bike outside the shop! Really? I thought this was a bike shop!!!  I really wanted a bike seat so i left my bike outside and went inside to purchase a seat i asked if they would install it for me since i had the bike with me and they had all the tools i thought its just a bike seat should be easy. Nope that was extra $$$$$ to install the seat! The bike seat was $60 and they wanted more money?? Total dissapointment.</Review>

I cannot recommend the bike fitting that Just Ride LA provides enough. Before I came to get my bike fit at JRLA, I had gone through 3 different (and very expensive) saddles and still had no relief from lower back, knee, and groin pain (even top of the line chamois' were not helping). Everything changed when Chris fitted me. His fitting was meticulous: it included a preliminary questionnaire where he asked me everything from how I would like to ride to body measurements, refitting my clips and getting new insoles for my shoes, and the best was finally getting a saddle that actually fit and felt comfortable to sit on (turns out I prefer power saddles)! In total, the fitting lasted for two hours, but now I can ride with complete comfort and no pain. I have never had a fitting as good as this. Trust me when I say this: this fitting is WORTH EVERY PENNY!</text>

< Review>
Used to come here all the time but had a flat tire from my ride home from work. Bought my tube and didn't have my tools on me. Asked to used theirs to put my tube on they said no. So I asked if they could put it on and they wanted the same amount of money the tube costed. I offered them all the money I had left on me which was half of what they where asking to put the tube on and said no. This was right before closing time so their were no other shops open. Not even an auto shop was open where I'm sure they would have let me use a wrench. Awful experience. I've bought bikes here and lots of parts. Always use their free air when I'm in the area, but that's the last time I go to this shop. Guy that was running the bike repairs was totally stuck up like he got off in the fact that I'd have to walk my bike home. Is this what the bike community has come to? SMH< /Review>

<text>Excellent service, excellent variety, very competitive. Spoke with owner for awhile, they have been open about 8 months, he use to sell parts and now runs this shop. I don't personally know how well the store is doin, but it was very busy the two days I went in and with higher gas prices and summer coming, I assume it is very good.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I had been riding for about two years on my bike and had received a bike fit previously.  Even with the prior fitting, I was still experiencing pain and discomfort.  JRLA took the time to talk to me about what kind of cycling I was doing, offer me the best prices for new equipment for my bike, and took the time to explain to me why and how everything that they were doing.</Text><user_id>103279297043087204604</user_id>< GmapID>

< Review>
Walked in with a hybrid commuter that had been siting out side for a while and i told the guy i just wanted to get it running again. He said that i basically need to spend about 250 to set it all up again. He was just trying to sell me even new cables and chain when the ones that are on work. Ended up buying a rim that was clearly destroyed and some grips and it cost me 80 dollars with 20 worth of labor. definitely got RIPPED OFF! then i ask them to pull the cables on the back brake a bit just to make it more responsive and i get a " ohh no, that going to cost you more" all he had to do is adjust the cable a bit. That was the least they could do after i spend 80 bucks in 5 min. Really bad customer service.... ever.... NEVER GOING BACK THERE!< /Review>

these guys are A-1 with service. I bought a Cinelli from Just Ride LA in 2012 and just recently the frame cracked in the welding. the warranty from the manufacturer for the frame was 2 years pass expiration and Just Ride still went to work to secure me a replacement frame. In the end I got my frame replaced with a new 2016. there was no worry or hassle and no cost beyond the rebuild ......these guys will really work with you.....thank you Just Ride LA.

<Rating>2</Rating><text>Very nice people, but I keep going here to buy things - tubes, peddles, lights, tune-ups, etc. and everything breaks within a week.
I keep going back cause they are so close to where I live, but I keep getting into trouble cause I always have problems with their cheap products.  I even buy the more expensive stuff just to make sure I won't have any problems and still I always suffer in the end.
So many woes during so many times riding.  Be good to yourself and find some place else.</text>< pictures>

First of all I just wanted to say that this is the only place I recommend to my friends around here.  A year ago my girlfriend got her bike here and they were so helpful and nice.  We've been back multiple times since because we love their service and our experience there!  We've had other bicycles fixed, bought necessary and unnnecessary but fun products(that are never cheap and still haven't broken after a year...and we bought the cheap stuff), and just returned this past week to look at bicycles we're planning on buying since my girlfriend's was just stolen.

Thank you to everyone that works here for being so helpful and knowledgeable!  Will definitely keep recommending Just Bike LA and remain a loyal customer< /text>< gmap_id>

Yummy!!! A must try. We were told while trying to figure out what to order that "everything's hella good".  He was right. We had pockets (1 spicy, 1 regular) and a side of fries.  So so good!!<//Text>

One of my go-to spots for lunch. Tasty, fresh Persian classics and really friendly atmosphere. Outdoor patio seating in the fashion district is a huge plus.  The  burger is seriously under the radar.  The most is really well spiced and it's served on real bread, not just a generic bun.</Text>

Seriously solid Turkish food. Homemade bread, absolutely fantastic Börek (which consequently runs out), and a great selection of bakhlava (honestly the best I've had in a long time, and definitely the best I've had in the city). Don't leave without a Turkish Delight.</Text>

I really liked this restaurant. It’s nicely decorated and the ambience is great. Pleasant music is playing in the background. The service was very nice and the taste of the food was stellar. I ordered kebab and the sauce was the richest and most savory I have ever tasted on this dish. I wish these guys the best!</text>

All the foods were fresh and the dishes had the warmth of home-made food. The chefs takes great care in selecting the best quality ingredients. I really had great experience in presto grill.</review>

Don't let the Hispanic staff & music put you off.  It's really Persian food cooked & served by friendly staff.  The place is impressively clean, right down to the feet of the kitchen furnishings. Portions are big too.</Text>

<Text>I recently placed a order with Presto grill  and ordered the omlett and 3 kobideh lunch specials which are $6.99 for my co-workers.  When I received my order I noticed that I did not get what I ordered. They sent me the wrong meal! The delivery guy was very kind and apologized for the mistake and told me that he would go back to the restaurant and get my order correct.  After waiting another 20 mins I finally received my omlett and kobideh.  I was very dissatisfied with my omlett.  The omlett was black and the vegetables tasted very bad.  The omlett was very salty and it did not look like a egg.  It looked black like the oil they used to make the omlett was dirty.  It was disgusting!! The rice with the kobideh was burnt and did not have any flavor.  I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I called to complain and the girl who answered was very rude!  She sounded very upset because I told her that I was not happy with my meal.  The customer service and the food are very bad.  I don't recommend that anyone order from this restaurant.  I give the food and the service at presto grill 1 star !!!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I sure did not expect to give Presto Grill such a low rating. But I must because overall the food was not good.

The restaurant is clean and inviting. You can sit outside on the spacious patio or inside at one of the small tables. All unexpected in the middle of the Fabric District. The waitress and cooks were nice and friendly. Service was fast. Prices were good.

The koubideh was not good. The flavor of the meat and the seasonings were bad. It tasted like they had mixed liver in with the meat when it was ground. That is not necessarily bad but in this case was way too much and affected the flavor overall.

I had the Zeresk polo and boneless chicken. It was good. The zeresk were not too sweet and not too sour. The chicken was cooked perfectly. This is hard to find as many places cut the pieces uneven
And they cook unevenly on the grill. So perfect Chicken and zeresk polo.

We took a Falafel sandwich to go. How could they make it bad? I really wanted it to be good. It came with French fries which were great. The French roll was perfect for a sandwich. Onions, pickles and lettuce were very tasty but the falafel was just bad. It didn't taste good at all. I couldn't even eat it.
I was so sad because the bread had so much potential.

Should be 2.5 Stars.< /Review>

<Time>1525846898757</Time><rate>3<//rate><Review>I sure did not expect to give Presto Grill such a low rating. But I must because overall the food was not good.

The restaurant is clean and inviting. You can sit outside on the spacious patio or inside at one of the small tables. All unexpected in the middle of the Fabric District. The waitress and cooks were nice and friendly. Service was fast. Prices were good.

The koubideh was not good. The flavor of the meat and the seasonings were bad. It tasted like they had mixed liver in with the meat when it was ground. That is not necessarily bad but in this case was way too much and affected the flavor overall.

I had the Zeresk polo and boneless chicken. It was good. The zeresk were not too sweet and not too sour. The chicken was cooked perfectly. This is hard to find as many places cut the pieces uneven
And they cook unevenly on the grill. So perfect Chicken and zeresk polo.

We took a Falafel sandwich to go. How could they make it bad? I really wanted it to be good. It came with French fries which were great. The French roll was perfect for a sandwich. Onions, pickles and lettuce were very tasty but the falafel was just bad. It didn't taste good at all. I couldn't even eat it.
I was so sad because the bread had so much potential.

Should be 2.5 Stars.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<review>Good food. The outdoor seating gives you a good view of the busy street and the ambience of the Los Angeles life. The restroom is clean with neatly placed ornaments, the smell is floral and the floor is dry.
However, even though the outdoor seating a good choice because of the view and the ambience, if you don't like to smell of cigarette smoke, better use the indoor seating. On the inside seating, you'll be treated with a background music of the piped in music (it was Richard Clayderman album that was playing as shown on their wall TV)  and the conversation of the cook, and the flickering shadow of their ceiling fan.
Four 4-seater, three 2-seater tables inside and one 4-seater, four 2-seater tables outdoor.
A good place to enjoy Persian cuisine but don't come very hungry, their service can take some time to arrive.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c633573874e9:0x4f886aa807ea0fed<//GmapID></record>

<review>The food was decent and portion size left something to be desired... my friends & I ordered according to what the owner suggested as he said they didn't have several items that are pictured on their wall. My vegetarian platter had a large salad but it was mostly the white part of the iceberg lettuce and not very many greens. Instead of falafel they tossed a chopped up veggie burger that was purchased from Costco which I also have in my freezer at home. My friends had similar salad platters one with tiny pieces of chicken sprinkled on the top & the other with one skinny kebab. The presentation was nice & we enjoyed our meals until the verbal total was announced. We were shocked to hear our total was $41.00 for our 3 dishes when most of their dishes are advised here for $6.99!!! Not at all what we expect from a hole in the wall diner style restaurant on the east side of DTLA. When we asked for separate checks & the owner didn't want to split them up... we were the only people there so it wasn't like it was an inconvenience. I was going to pay with credit card & have my friends give me cash but then he said their credit card machine wasn't activated yet as they were under new ownership as of 3 weeks ago. When we asked for a break down of the prices he explained that the chicken was an extra $3 & the sides of tahini & hummus that we didn't order were $2 each... he brought them with the platters so naturally we assumed that came with it. We never saw an actual bill & because the items on their printed menu as well as their picture menu on their wall were entirely  different he could just charge what ever he wants. I would have never sat down if I had know I was going to pay $14 for a mediocre veggie salad & soda!!  I paid $6 for a similar platter from here that had these fantastic giant falafel balls & was the reason I came back with my friends. Funny thing is the previous owner was sitting inside the whole time & when I asked if he knew the previous owner he said it was the lady inside who had come by to get some mail.  I'm all about supporting my local businesses & keeping it in the family but I don't appreciate being lied to my face & haggling over prices... we won't be coming back here again unless his mom decides to do a free falafel day!</review><Date>1479248622973<//Date>< gmap_id>

The food tasted good, the workers were nice. Only complaint is that they were skimpy on the fries. Paid $3.59 for large fries and the container was 2/3 full. Sharing a picture to show how we pulled it out of the bag< /review>

Couldn't have been faster, fresher or any more easy than the excellent service at this Wendys. Truly good service with friendly and professional courtesy - not to be mistaken for facetious groveling. This crew is 'true blue' with no platitude in their attitude.

It's a pretty average gas station/travel center fast food place. It's clean and the food is fresh. The fries are good. But they don't serve  frostiest at this location. Very disappointed with that discovery.< /review>

I visited the Pilot gas station; I wanted to mention that this gas station had a fully stocked windshield washing area at the pump for your convenience. They actually had a fresh pale of soapy water for customers to use. Very nice!</Text>

Food was very mediocre and way overpriced. It seems like you pay for the advertising on all the packaging. They were closed one time when we went there but left the open sign lit. Which, as it turns out was a good thing because the next time I went there I spent $30! On 3 people for fast food!!! Shocked and appalled!< /text>

I'm pretty sure I left a five-star review at one point. They always had hot fries and juicy burgers. Today was different they forgot my son's cheeseburger so I had to get out of my car and wait  in line for that. Then as I was driving home and took a sip of my soda and realized it wasn't coke it was diet Coke! I thought I would treat myself to something good and greasy today and it ended up being a bad decision to stop at Wendy's.<//Text>

Small drive thru area for ordering - cannot accommodate large vehicles or any trailers. They always get your orders correct and their soft drinks don't taste like a mixture of all the flavors poured before your drink like some Wendy's soft drinks do.</review>

The quality of their hamburgers had gone WAY down- the chicken is great and so are the different flavored lemonades and the chili is too DIE FOR!
BUT... don't bother making any special requests, like no ketchup or mustard,  only mayo.. you'll get a burger with NOTHING but the patty and mayo. All the lettuce,  tomato,  etc will not be there.. they don't comprehend any changes you request... and if they attempt, the order comes out all screwed up.<//text>

Avoid this place at all costs, this place is only good for truck drivers and homeless people to get a quick bite. They got my order wrong twice and it was a very simple order nothing fancy. The employees were too busy joking around to care that there were customers in line. The food also wasn't very good, the only good thing about this place is that when you walk in there is a cinnamon and the young lady that works there is very nice and friendly.<//text>

Only problem I have ever encountered there is being to busy in their drivethru but you can always go inside and skip the drive thru line. If you do choose to go inside you might want to keep in mind that it is a trick stop so most of the facilities are just that, truck stop facilities. That being said it is one of the better truck stop fast food places I've seen.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80db18ef6d09e5a7:0x1b54d3978a9bc7d3<//Gmap_id><userid>107451413259160290304<//userid>< Response>

"Baconator" burger to my horror is expensive @ $9.00!!!

But this is SHOCKING .. $9 for a burger???? that'll be my last time at Wendy's.< /review>

Cold food, we stop at truck stops all the time due to the fact he drives a truck. It is so disappointing when you spend all this money on the very little selection that we get...and get cold old food.< /Text>

I have a problem eating their food. It doesn't agree with me, and I need to know why!  Most other eateries do not affect me like this.  I want to know what chemicals they are putting in their food that makes me a cripple for a few days to a week?  Until my body filters out the toxins, I m a basket case... I'm warning everybody that goes there... especially Seniors, NOT to eat HERE!  😖. I had fries today...that's all I m going to chance.  And, Corporate was suppose to call me back with an answer, and they didn't bother.  What does that tell you about their customer service?  And I'm a retired doctor, so they will have hell to pay, don't you know!<//review>

<review>The person who was taking our order was either 1) going deaf, 2) ignorant, 3) high as you can get , or dadadum.... drum roll..... all of the above. Ok I get it sometimes its hard to get someone to work fast-food on a Saturday night. " no intentional discrimination to whoever does" but come on "DAVE" SERIOUSLY. Not only did you cut the corners with this employee u totally picked all the scraps off the floor to make the "burger"". If there was an option for no star, I would have selected it. Better yet, Google how about adding a negative star option?</review>< pictures>

In a pinch I will go here. Over priced food and I don't like several things on the menu. Potato wedges with bfast are awful and so much salt. Reg fries are better but still too salty. Coffee is good.< /review>

Our order consisted of 2 dried up double hamburgers with wilted lettuce and tomatoes, and greasy limp fries! Never had this issue before, I'm guessing the bugers' were microwaved to heat up. They at least could of added fresh toppings and fresh buns! Never will go back to this location again!< /text>

Sometimes the hamburgers taste as if they were reheated or aged, not fresh and juicy.</text>

What can I say, Wendy's is really superb! Those baked potatoes just doit. By itself the baked potatoe Is a meal. Fast service, great menu, clean. I just wish they'd keep the fish longer ( year round ) and reduce the cook time on it.<//Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>Horrible just Horrible so I asked for an Asiago Chicken Sandwich (I ordered the Original Crispy one by combo number on the menu) So the guy says would you like it Grilled or Spicy I'm like well you don't have the regular one he says no. Then I asked well is it really Spicy? He says no not at all 🤦‍♀️ which let me tell you I can handle a little spice like the Competitors Spicy Chicken Nuggets but my tummy can't handle SPICY stuff and this was one of them half way through i had to stop eating it. Then I asked him to lettuce wrap it, he begins to tell me that they have NO LETTUCE. He's like is that ok? Well I don't have a choice so I said ok I was in a LONG line in the drive thru I couldn't back out and leave. So when I get to the window it has a sign that due to the fires they can't get lettuce delivered BUT yet other Competitors in the vicinity have lettuce 🤔.  So yeah the sandwich was gross and I doubt that I'll ever stop at this Wendy's ever again! I'm glad I don't live close by lol< /Review><response>None< /response>< Time>

Wendy's inside the Flying J. It's right off the freeway with clean bathrooms. It has a Cinnabon inside and a small convenience store. Has plenty of pumps so there's not much waiting<//text>

No one in line, which okay being the middle of night there usually is rarely a line. Nevertheless always nice when no line, but had a minimal order of just Jr.deluxe cheeseburger, and had brief wait as they prepared it fresh, which I'm happy to wait for any food if it's made on the spot Instead of just warmed or if meat just barely heated up the  condiments thrown together sloppily, like not even hot or warm enough to melt or heat up the cheese( gross) but is Wendy's I've always had great experiences with them:) great quick customer service taking order and then again like I said quick service for receiving my food. I only give it 4 stars because they do not serve their Frosty's past like 10 or 11 cuz it's always the machines" cleaning itself" (for hours till morning?) Kinda weird takes all night to clean. But yeah served their frostys till they closed it, and fixed their dang order box outside which I understand its on hella due to it being at truck stop which them trucks are and can be loud but jesus,plus it gets windy down there all the time but that thing is just a little overkill with how obnoxious it is...other tha  those two minor thing 5 stars.

This was likely the Very best service from a Wendy's I've ever received. Very friendly and concise service. Fast paced. Very clean. This Wendy's is adjoined to a Luvs trucks and cars has station. Bathrooms are shared, so they're busy and may not always be very clean. The dinning area is very separate and clean. Expect the very best from this face paced Wendy's near the highway.<//text>

Normally good hot fries and fresh food. Today was a very off day. Not sure what happened but attention to detail was missed.
The spicy tenders were definitely not fresh, barely warm< /review>

Stopped here for lunch the other day and the staff were amazing, never met employees that worked so well together and the customer service was the best I've seen at a fast food restaurant, was greeted the moment I came in and food was out in a reasonable time. If you're traveling along the I-10 and looking for a quick bite to eat I'd definitely recommend this place<//Text>

I don't believe they make there burgers to order as the commercial says. From start to finish it maybe to 5 mins and the favors of the burger did not mesh together. The french fries were hot though.<//text>

The homestyle chicken was cold and softly breaded. The cashier was rude. The chili barely had cheese and onion like I requested and they had ran out of lettuce and tomato in the midfle of the day. Wont return to this location.<//Review>

Could be the time of day. Never had issues here before but at 1am, things happen and I get it. Recieved wrong burger, lettuce was wilted but the rest of the burger was good. Fries were nice and hot, nuggets very tasty, but he forgot the sauces. Truth be told, Wendy's nuggets are perfect plain so no big deal there. Seemed one crew member shy of the need but, like I said, beggars can't be choosers at 1am.<//text>

<Text>In general, Wendy's is a little bit better than most fast food places, in my opinion.  This location is nice and convenient because it is located inside a Pilot travel center.

Fast food should be combined with other convenient places of business and it should be suited to the business and clientele. In this case, they did s good job of that.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

This is the slowest Wendy's in the universe. When I worked at a Wendy's it was very important that we tried to average 2 minutes per drive through guest. We didn't always achieve this goal, but it was rarely higher than 3 minutes.</Review>

Everytime I come in here after the sun went down this place is a hot mess. Untrained employees standing around unsure of what to do. Orders getting cold, fries sitting out. Employees putting orders on counter then forgetting they are there so they remake it. They really need to fire whoever's in charge and hire someone that knows how to manage and train employees. No wonder everytime I come in here there's new people. Worst Wendy's ever. McDonald's employees work harder.</Review>< Pictures>

This was the North Palm Springs, CA location. It was not bad food wise, but the rest was questionable! The restaurant itself is clean for as busy as it is. Staff is patient and kind. But the environment and outdoors of the property does not feel safe at night at all! They NEED security. Badly.  Too much traffic and the parking is not well lit at all. I kept being approached by pan handlers and worse type people and nothing is done about it! Scary. And I am a tough woman, but still kind and do not mind helping those in need if it is legit. It was especially busy with brazen drug dealers and sex traffickers/workers prevailent in the area. Those people were not good people and kept approaching everyone, outside arriving to ise any of tje facilities there, but I will spare those details. It really made me angry and I call 911 to report it before I left after my meal, I was concerned for other innocent people, especially those with small children or woman by themselves. I do recommend carrying mace or other defense if your a woman using this location at night! And be very, very wary of your surroundings and please never walk alone!! Ever. Regarding the food... I am Vegetarian for medical reasons, so their full menu does not have many items that cater to those with diet restrictions or health preferences to choose from. It was late or I would have found somewhere else that did. So I went with their sour cream and chive baked potato with extra cheese sauce on the side. It was good. The menu is a little too pricey though, for fast food in my opinion! But the food is always good when it is made correctly. Security not so good. It is connected to a Pilot gas station a Cinnabon.  Be careful y'all. At night at least. I was literally approached by a male escort), a man selling illicit drugs, and a man asking for money. To which I kindly donated my last $1 to that I had on hand. I am a good, honest person. Not trying to create drama. I am just truly concerned for the welfare of the travelers and consumers who use this Wendy's/Pilot Station rest stop. I would hate tk see anyone get hurt just because they stopped to have a nice fast food meal. I'd give 5 stars but cannot due to my experience on their joint property outdoors. I hope this helps people in the future. And I hope they hire security officers, 2 at least to manage the doors and outdoor area for safety reasons. Stay safe everyone. ✌⭐⭐⭐ 🙏😇< /Review>

It's awesome that they're always open when you need them to be which is what my original one was but I'm going to have to bring them down to three stars that are inconvenient Hardware in relation to catching up to what is currently the norm which is being able to pay with one's phone at the window is severely behind on top of that their workers are less than willing to work with you and would sooner give you attitude and avoid the communication then follow through with simple requests sorry guys you might want to work on your employees communication and maybe it's time to catch up and start doing Samsung or Apple pay at the window< /Review>

Wendy's has a varied fast food menu, with burgers,  chicken sandwiches and wraps, salads, sides, and their soft-serve ice cream Frosty. They have a good value menu and their  4 for $4 promotion is a great value.  This location is inside the Pilot truck stop, and does not have self-serve beverages. The staff was very friendly.</Text>

I have always like Wendy's but I don't know if all Wendy's are like this one at The Pilot Truck Stop? I remember their slogan" Never Frozen , Always Fresh , Never Cooked until Ordered ! I really have to call "BS" to that !! I worked as a cook and a assistant chef in food service when I was a bit younger , and I was quite good and very fast. Of coyrse it never was fast food ! But there is no way that I could cook , dress and wrap a burger in 3 minutes or less ? Any way the five stars are because I like pilot Derrick stops , if you want fast food go to Carls  JR.</Text>

Marvelous service, my family and I came here and ordered us some food about 2pm and two of our orders were messed up. The manager Sonja and the cook were calm about the situation and had given me a full free meal. I will be returning here for now on. Thank you for making my day.</Review>

Customer service was excellent!
I had a salad that was great! I was offered a Frosty.
I replied no. But I should have asked for water.

They not only have a Wendy's at the Flying J where this is located, but they also have a Cinnabon. As soon as you walk in you smell Cinnabon so, if you want a good dessert, go in, get a combo from Wendy's and then get a Cinnamon Bun from Cinnabon. And if you need to stop for a shower or anything else? This is a great place to do so.< /Text>

Absolutely the worst!!!!!  I left a severly bax review, but low and behold it didnt take.  The place is filthy, the servers fouled mouthed and no tack or coutesty what so ever.  My dad stood and waited while two worked gabbed about personal matters, befor they would even acknowledge him.  I will never go back.  And to the person the owns the franchise, stip by and check it out.  What a fithly and professionally ran establishment.<//Text>

Good location. I was ranting on my phone through the drive thru window and she just went with it, was respectful that I was on the phone and still got me what I needed. Thank you!

Wendys always got cold fries and undercooked square burgers. It's unfortunate because I used to like Wendys alot . Maybe there frosty machine needs cleaning also because Everytime I get frosty I get a stomach ache . Poor Wendys I feel bad now but facts are facts .<//text>

First of all, the food never seems to be fresh, the size of the pop and fries are much smaller than that of every other Wendy's I've been to. It's a shame to see how truck stops acquire such a franchise and systematically run the company name into the ground.< /Review>

Although next to busy I-10, and in a truck stop, this place has always had stupendous customer service; it's  always been expedient, cordial, and flawless.</Review>

< Review>
They only had 1 register going so is was kinda a wait but the pearberry tea was worth the wait. I also got the mini sausage links rapped in a cinnamonie kinda french toast things. They were ok when dripping with the syrup they give to you. Not enough syrup and they had a funny "processed food"  kinda taste thou. Then again, it is fast food.</Review>

Food good, needs to stop using cucumbers and use real dill pickles.
Out of everything in the evening, chicken tenders look and taste like larger nuggets, not tenders, McDonald's and Chester's have good tenders, just sayin'<//Text>

They are rude, Extremely slow, and the female manager was loud and rude to her staff. I was in line with 5 other people and every single one of our orders was wrong. I was surprised the managers were so complacent. Also, the tables were dirty and there was trash on the floor...shame. I really hope the regional managers see all the negative comments and do something about it.<//Review>< pics>

They're okay.... The only big problem I have with this Wendys location is every time I order here they only mess my meal up... How hard is it to not put tomatoes on a sandwich... This seriously has happened about a dozen times and I repeat myself to make sure they got it right and to no avail I get home to see a damn tomato.. I'm allergic c'mon.< /review>

I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich  I was disappointed that Wendy's had changed the type of bun.  Why change a good thing and use only a cheap hamburger bum.<//Review>

I wanted Wendy's so bad when I got there it was so crowded and I was left waiting at the counter for a while. Long enough for me to look around and realize that it was filthy in the kitchen. I figured well they're busy and they don't have time to clean however they left me waiting at the counter for so long workers kept walking by me and ignoring me like they couldn't even see me. I let it go on for a few more minutes and decided screw this I'm keeping my money and I ended up going to Cinnabon which is in the same building and that was pretty good. Next time I want Wendy's I'm going to try the one in Rancho Mirage because this one sucked!!!! Filthy conditions and crappy customer service no thanks Wendy's!!! ✌✌✌✌</text>

The service was swift and the food was served fresh. Since I don't get to have Wendy's often, it's always a pleasure getting the opportunity to eat Wendy's.< /review>

<review>The lady at the front counter was very friendly and sweet. The girls in the back stood there and talked crap about her in spanish. I got extremely cold looks from the girls in the back due to what seemes anger at the fact that I was with my boyfriend who is Mexican. Im sure they didn't think I understood what they were saying... I would not come back here again. Not if I am to be looked down on or treated poorly because I am white and my boyfriend is Mexican. And I feel sorry for the lady at the front counter having to put up with those evil girls in the back.< /review>< rate>

This place blows, all I ordered was fries thru the drivethru. They made me wait and said they would be right out w my order. So after waiting for ten minutes I went inside and asked where were my fries, the girl taking my order forgot to tell the manager to put them in the fryer, neither of them said sorry or offered me a free drink or fries for waiting least thirteen minutes.
Don't bother going here, service sucks.< /text>
