<user_id>110737414671134992210< /user_id><text>I have lived in the neighborhood for 30 years and the owners are always helpful and very knowledgeable but the egregious behavior I witnessed the owners have towards and elderly customer today was so sickening I will not go back.

As I am browsing Lavender plants an older gentleman in a pick-up pulls in and parks his car near the exit, blocking the it. As expected, the owner comes out to ask him to move the car, but does he ask? No. He begins yelling at him, “YOU ARE BLOCKING THE EXIT, YOU NEED TO MOVE!” repeatedly. He is wearing a mask so it makes the directions he is yelling out from a far more difficult to hear. One might think, simply walking over to calmly explain, “Sorry Sir, but your car is blocking the exit, you’re going to need to move it,” would be a perfectly fine response…

The man gets out of the car and walks over to better understand what the owner is trying to say. Quickly it becomes apparent that the older gentleman doesn’t understand English well and is trying to understand. Instead of calmly explaining the owner begins SCREAMING AT HIM, “YOU NEED TO GET OFF! GET OUT OF HERE! YOU CAN’T PARK THERE! YOU NEED TO GO! GET OUT OF HERE! GO!”

The elder gentleman looks at the car and back at the owner, trying to ask if that’s what he is upset about until he finally realizes it is, and goes to move the car.

That spectacle alone made me very uncomfortable and feel very empathetic for the guy. I was quite and continued to look at the lavender but it left a very bad taste in my mouth, excuse the pun. I wondered if it wasn’t my duty just to tell the owner, “hey, you didn’t need to yell at him,” or just something to not feel as though I stood idly by, but alas, the gentleman moved his car, the owner went inside… I figured, no harm, no foul and continued browsing.

A few minutes later, the gentleman, having moved his car, comes back to the nursery but forgot his mask. Mind you it is all outdoors and particularly now with many vaccinated, I’ve seen people, neglectfully but not maliciously forget their masks. Still masks are a musts but, AGAIN, malicious or not, screaming is not OK!

The owner comes back out and berates him again, screaming “GET OUT! YOU NEED A MASK! GO GET A MASK OR GET OUT OF HERE! YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE!” Again, the man who clearly spoke little English was very confused. He looked around and explained that he had moved his car and the owner replied, “I DON’T CARE! YOU DON’T HAVE A MASK! YOU NEED TO GO! GET OUT OF HERE!” After a minute and a half too long of this egregious and disgusting behavior, the man realized his mistake and calmly, if not painfully walked out to get a mask.

Finally I had seen enough and I looked at the owner, with my mask and all and demanded, “Why are you yelling at him like that? What is the matter with you? Clearly, he can’t understand what you are trying to say.”

The owner, shocked, began telling me (very aggressively) that he COULD understand, and implied the guy was being a problem for no other reason than to be a problem. This didn’t make sense at all as he was clearly there, like all the other people who witnessed this, to get plants to plant.

I explained to the owner, “You don’t need to yell at him. In fact yelling makes it more difficult to understand you, especially when wearing a mask and standing from afar…”

Also is there ANY REASON EVER to scream at someone?! Even if it was malicious, (which it entirely was NOT) wouldn’t you calmly ask someone to leave and explain you will call the police? I don’t know the owners history with this man but I don’t need to. That kind of behavior is disgusting and horrendous. As an onlooker, I was so uncomfortable and felt empathetic for the elderly man. Yes, he forgot the mask, and parked incorrectly, but when he understood what the problem was, in both sitches he was happy to resolve it quickly.

Screaming at a guy because he couldn't understand but was trying too was so so off putting. I never make reviews like this but my god, it was just so ugly.  Never again will I shop here.</text>< Time>

<Review>The best nursery in the area! Plenty of options and amazing prices. They have herbs, flowers, roses, fruit trees, and more! They also have a greenhouse room with a ton of indoor plants. Highly recommended  to everyone. It is a family run business and they are always so happy and helpful, and most importantly extremely knowledgeable. There is also a cute cat that likes to say hello, so no dogs allowed. Do your nursery shopping here!<//Review><Rating>5<//Rating><GmapID>0x80c2960b38131d71:0x603cee45439b737< /GmapID>< Name>

<review>My wife and I have been going here for the last 15+ yrs. Re: owners- the woman was helpful & kind, but the elder looking brother today was arrogant, extremely rude & disrespectful. It took me a second to realize he wasn’t joking.
They have lost our business.< /review></record>

What a beautiful family run nursery! We just moved to Valley Village and couldn’t resist visiting Sego Nursery to keep filling our new home with more plants. The greenhouse portion is very well stocked and maintained with TONS of houseplants. From Fiddle Leaf Figs, Rubber Trees, and Calatheas, to Hoyas! They’ve got something for you! The super friendly woman who rung us up funnily told me “straight home now okay no more shopping!” But, truth be told I have little self control when it comes to houseplants so I’ll definitely be back. Thank you Sego Nursery!

P.s: the shop cats are ADORABLE.<//Text>

The staff at Sego do not suffer fools. You are in THEIR store so mind your manners. Be careful what and how you touch things. If you follow the rules, you will have a pleasant experience while purchasing from a great and robust collection of plants, trees, flowers, etc. You can even walk away with expert advice. If you are polite. 😉 Closed on Thursday!!</Review>

I’ve been going to Sego for over 30 years and love the place.  Good variety of vegetables, trees and flowers. Prices are competitive with other nurseries.
The entire family can tell you anything you need to know about plants.< /Review>

<Review>Family owned., multigenerational. Very helpful and they know everything about what they’re selling. They will even talk you out of buying something if they don’t think you need it or it’s the wrong time of year to use it. They aren’t the cheapest but they aren’t the most expensive either.<//Review>< date>

I love this nursery and the owners so much. They have a bunch of rare cultivars and tons of heirloom/organic/non-gmo seed and live plants. They have a great depth of knowledge about gardening, always ready with excellent advice and guidance. Best nursery in town.< /Text>

<Review>Bug infested plants + poor customer service = no thank you! We purchased a Bougainvillea from here which ended up being infested with mealybugs. The owner refused to replace the plant or give a refund, but instead tried to sell us a bug killer product at an extra $9. When we politely indicated our dissatisfaction with the situation, he became hostile and rude. Filing a dispute on my MasterCard and will never ever step foot in this place again.</Review>< rate>

I got to the door ten minutes before closing looking to buy a quick gift for a friend who needed a pick me up. The worker was standing in the driveway informed me that they were closed, even though online it says they close at 5. They responded with “well, not today.” Clearly this must not be the owner. Whatever, I’ll go somewhere else. Sucks that my experience has to be 1 star because of this.</Review>< pics>

So here is the thing. I put 5 stars because I hate that people just follow the stars rating visit or not visit some places. This place it was introduce by a friend. First visit, yes I thought they were the most rude people ever, but then I found out that it is how they are, I mean culturally. Everyone here in L.A. comes front different countries and places, so do not expect your modals or what you expect. It is 50/50 of which I respect. Second visit, it was amazing, the owner on her tone she help me with advice on my garden and soil. I purchased seeds and succulents. They still alive. So first to purchase a plant, investigate if it is season, or if you have the appropriate space and sun. Also the owner she gently advised me just to take the season seeds due it was fall and I was trying to buy corn (no way). So have fun with your experience, they own the place so basically they can do whatever they want (and they know a lot about their plants) and they are not a chain. Not dogs and read the signs. If is is your first time at this place, go prepare. good luck</text>

A beautiful, large nursery with variety of outside & indoor plants. They'll pot the plants into a new pot if you buy a pot there as well (and I assume so if you bring one?). Prices are pretty reasonable, and they just have so many different plants from small cacti to big indoor plants to edible plants, flowers, etc. The people here were very helpful in answering my questions and helping me pick out plants for my room.< /Text>

<review>Sego is a wonderful family owned and operated nursery. They have helped me countless times over the years with all my non-green thumb questions! Always patient, always kind! Parking is free but limited. They have cats so no dogs are allowed I believe. A great place to go for all your indoor/outdoor plant needs!</review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I love this nursery so much. The selection of plants is diverse, and for such a small place it feels like you can get lost in that small and beautiful garden. Plants are labeled for the most part too. Got two plants from here and is convenient walk for anyone living close to 20th avenue.< /Text>

<Text>We go to Sego every spring, summer and whenever we need speciality plants, and good advice.  They always have great mint, lettuce, tomatoes, flowering vines, zucchini and some hard to find flowers and trees. There are things that they do not have, they are happy to order too.  Due to all their experience, I get lots of good no-nonsense answers to my planting and gardening issues. I love Sego Nursery.<//Text>< Rate>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>Have been shopping there every few days for months. I've lost track of how much money I've spent there. All of a sudden today I get angrily snapped at while trying to make a purchase. Later I find out it's because they somehow believe I was pulling apart and damaging their orchids?! What?! 😲 I don't even know what to say to that. All I did was select an orchid from a tray that was overgrown to purchase. Aren't they there for people to buy? Isn't that the point? When I told them I hadn't done anything wrong and didn't deserve to be snapped at while making a purchase and would rather shop elsewhere than be treated like that, all they said was, "Ok" and that was the end of the call. 😳 I even bought the orchid in question. They snapped at me angrily while charging my credit card for an orchid because I got the orchid from their tray of orchids for sale? I don't even really know to be honest. It's crazy whatever it is. It makes so sense. I'll just shop elsewhere. Any garden shop in southern California that thinks there isn't abundant competition for their business and that customers will put up with inappropriate behavior is sorely mistaken.

Real quality operation they have going on here with half dead plants for sale and horrible attitudes. 👌🙄

Go elsewhere. The shame of it is how close I live to them, but oh well. There's a million other shops close to me too. There isn't a single thing at this shop that isn't sold elsewhere nearby in better condition, for less money, or by more friendly people.

I was a good customer to this shop. Their plants gave my home fungus gnats and I never even complained. I've bought stuff that had root rot and never said a thing. I will not tolerate being treated poorly and disrespectfully when I have done nothing to deserve it though. What an ungrateful and petty bunch.< /Review><Date>1562974261494<//Date></record>

I was there to pick a plant for my mothers garden and was holding a plant, from the
Branch, fir a quick second,
I have a bad back and bad right hand,

This middle aged lady, ran from her shop
Like ferociously almost ready to strike me.
Telling me that I am holding the plant
Wrong. She said " How would you like someone hold you from your neck??! Huh ??
Lady I  buying that, and you don't talk to customers like that, you scared my son.

There is a reason, these nurseries are
Going extinct.
Extremely rude owner..

I went to Home Depot and
Saved $12 on the same plant, and if
I did hold the plant wrong for
10 seconds, and if anything
Happens to the plant, they will take it back.
Which I have never done so.<//Text>

I've been going to the Sego Nursery for more than twenty years.  This family owned nursery is local treasure.  Over years and the dozens of times I have been to the nursery, I have never had a negative experience.  In addition to the excellent quality of the plants in the nursery  they will gladly order anything you need for your garden that is not in stock.
I recently tried to buy some plants from them and they refused to sell the plants because they felt it was not the quality I wanted.  In stead they order fresh plants which were beautiful and perfect.  I highly recommend this nursery.</text>

We've been going to Sego nursery for years, since we discovered them when looking for plants for our garden. The family that owns and runs the nursery are Japanese American and, maybe chalk it up to being half Japanese, I can understand why some people feel like they're aloof or that they offer poor customer service. They aren't going to fall all over themselves trying to please you just because you show up. They're straight-forward, down-to-earth people who can point you at just the right plant for the situation you're looking at.

They keep a couple of cats around so one of their rules is "No Dogs". If you plan on  bringing your pooch, plan on leaving them in the car. And feel free to leave the cats be, it's not a petting zoo.

Also, if you want to bring a sample of a plant for them to look at (to identify or to help diagnose a problem), place it in a sealed plastic bag and expect them to handle it like it's the plague. Because of said cats and other reasons, they really would rather not have to carpet bomb their plants with insecticide or herbicide.

Other than that, they have a large selection of outdoor and indoor plants and a lot of knowledge. They have a smattering of tools, pots and miscellaneous items but their focus is on the plants, trees, flowers and soil you'll need to make your garden grow, regardless of the location.

Often the best experiences we've had with them start with a photo of a spot, a description of the light and water conditions and what we're looking to do. The more specific the better but they usually know what kind of plants will work within the confines of what you're looking to do. If you say "I'd like a flower that's red." You'll get what you can expect from that open-ended a question. If you say, "I'm looking for a plant that can handle a lot of shade but is drought-resistant and has a nice fragrance or can be used in cooking," you'll have better luck.

And no matter what, they'll tell me that despite my Japanese heritage demanding bamboo in my backyard, NO BAMBOO!</review>

I rarely write reviews but feel obligated to in this instance. We had a terrible experience purchasing an avocado tree from this nursery. The tree itself looked questionable when we purchased it but the rep insisted it would be fine. We were under the impression that the nursery would guarantee the tree for a few weeks, but when I called to report that the tree was not doing well the manager, Dean, was completely dismissive, unhelpful, and flat out rude. Apparently we were misinformed about the guarantee. Terrible, hostile customer service.</Text>

Sego is wonderful.  They carry a great selection of plants.  They are always able to answer my questions or refer me to another vendor for whatever I need.  I love this place.<//Text>

<review>I get it. The guy seems a little arrogant because he probably does know a lot and he hasn't learned how people skills can help a business or hurt a business. Overall the guy is fine he did come across a little laise fare in his attitude to help but once we built a rapport he opened up and was very nice and shared a lot of knowledge about the tree I just bought. I think it's amazing that he issues handouts for how to care for the plants you buy so that you can succeed.  Definitely the best selection in town.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c2960b38131d71:0x603cee45439b737</GmapID></record>

I like Sego a lot.  I'm happy to have a small nursery in the neighborhood, rather than having to drive to Burbank to buy at Lowes.  The pricing and selection are pretty good.  And I like giving the "little guy" my business.  Please go there.<//Text>

We've been customers for many years...if they don't have what you want they'll get it and you couldn't find a better place for advice. Warning...if you're bringing in diseased plants, have them in a sealed bag or you will get yelled at cuz that's kinda like lighting up at the gas pump!< /text>< Pictures>

< Review>
This nursery is great.  I found all the staff to be friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  (Customers who have bad attitudes to begin with, people who are arrogant, or people who are rude themselves are the same people who post negative comments....have you noticed?) (See above comment from a customer who gave this nursery a poor rating.)   Anyway, I walked into this garden store with a smile on my face and treated people the way I wish to be treated:  with genuine interest and pleasantries.  I shall make this my "go-to" gardening store.< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><review>What a cool place.  It's so completely stuffed with plants you can hardly get around, but that just means you will find exactly what you're looking for. If you can't find it, just ask someone. They will take the time to show you and answer all your questions. They will even tell you if you should get something somewhere else.

In response to this criticism that they are nosey and rude, they really know what they're doing, and if you take the time to listen, they might just teach something you don't know. That's why they are in the business that they are in!

On a side note, they have several very friendly kitty cats, so leave your pup at home.<//review>< pictures>

I'm trying to explain to him were I got the sample and he's yelling in front of everyone in the nursery. Omg worst experience I've ever had in any Nursery.

<review>I feel i got robbed. I took 3 45 gallon bags of cans and 4 45 gallon bags with plastic. Only got $139 they weigh using gross and net.  And give you the least weight which i don't understand. If i had 94 pounds in cans why did i only get paid for 45 pounds. Total rip off! Will never come back here again.</review>< Pics>

Every single time we have came we always just drove right by because the line is ridiculously long. Not to mention, from what heard i believe this is maybe one of two recycling centers left that still takes cans! Kind of a busy street to have the entrance to a recycling center at. Also, lots of less fortunate men and women carrying their bags on bicycles.</Text>

With a fast moving line this is a decently located recycling center to take your recyclables to exchange for money.  They accept all metals and crv type of recycling. Big loads and small loads are welcome.  Have your loads pre-sorted because of limited space. Competitive prices.</Text>

Super quick, super helpful.  Parking is a bit of a pain on a busy street, but the staff pointed me to a spot and helped me unload my vanful of recyclables.  Even though it was very busy, I was out in 15 minutes.< /text>

Customer service was on point and the girls in the office were super nice and explained the receipt. And because it was my first time, they gave me the coupon for the cans! I'll definitely be back! My bf also recycled copper and he said the price was higher than other places he went to.</text>

<response>None< /response><Text>I noticed from all the reviews that people either hate it or love it.  I am with the first group and the rest of you are either paid or just lying because this place is the biggest rip off.  Worse than the place by the flea market (Schnitzer)  I was there on an extremely HOT day and was getting dizzy so I was in a hurry  to get out.  I had  9 bins of plastic and 1 of aluminum.  (full) They only paid me about $50.00.  This 1 guy my husband was talking to said that he knows they cheat you, so he only brings in $20.00 worth at a time.  This place is scandalous!

<Review>I came in with <40 lbs nicely sorted aluminum. The guy went through it with a fine toothed comb breaking it into five different subcategories, all of which were worth less than what the other recycle place down the street (Tung-Tai) pays standard. These guys will do anything to screw you.<//Review><resp>None<//resp>< user_name>

<Text>I brought in 200 lbs of brass and they have paid me .30 per.  Less than half of what the scrap rate for similar brass is anywhere else.  And Maria has rage issues; she stopped processing my payment and yelled at me for 2 minutes bc I argued that that going rate was double what they were paying me.

Not the best place to sell scrap in the South Bay but the only one open on Sunday I know about</Text><Rating>1</Rating><gmapID>0x808fcc7c036e72e3:0x68cdafa4f8bcde5e<//gmapID><date>1562774104750</date>< user>

(Translated by Google) It is very fast, the people who work there are very fast to receive the recycling and above all they have the scale so that you can see how much
weighs its recycling, because in others like the one in Okland near the Cardenas Store they steal too much

(Original)
Es muy rápido, las personas que trabajan ahí son muy rápidos para recibir el reciclaje y sobre todo que tienen la báscula para que vea usted cuanto
pesa su reciclaje ,  por que en otros como el que está en Okland cerca de la Tienda Cardenas Roban demasiado<//text>

<review>No matter my interest of the day or week I can find information to satisfy my curiosity in great detail at this library. Yes I have the internet and a fast connection at home too but the library allows me to check out books and videos to review at my leisure. I can study diagrams in books without having to use my printer and consume ink and paper.

Checking out videos is simple and easy. Often I can get a video at the library before it is available for free on the internet and videos at the library are always commercial free.

Yes I love this library.<//review>< Pics>

Summer meal programs for children in need and even a seed exchange to encourage gardening. Staff is very helpful.  The only problems I've seen are just a result of lack of funding. Some of the books are rather old and could use replacing. Occasionally I come across a series with one or two books missing. All in all, For downtown Stockton they're doing pretty good.<//Text><userid>115185637620525587650<//userid><rating>4< /rating></record>

<Review>The library is an oasis in the neighbourhood. Staffs are super friendly and professionally. Various activities are organized through out the week. There are two private Study Rooms for those who need more privacy. Real fast internet is along the way for all readers in the library. Look forward to it!<//Review><rating>5</rating><userid>102053376091385088288< /userid>< name>

< Review>
This library has more that meets the eye, the makers studio is great. The have an Oculus, 3D printer, sewing machine and probably more. The library is clean and it's old yes. One security guard was really over the top and rude to me but the staff treated me alot better that same guard is still there they should keep him outside to keep the loiters at Bay since he is overzealous and could use that energy there. Great book selection I find myself using the online experience which is new to me and staff helped me figure out. Overall I like this location. The restrooms are usually clean. I like the location being near Downtown has a nice small park to hangout at near Starbucks. The only reason it's not a 5 star is because the lingering people  usually homeless which in some areas outside smells like feces. And it could use a update to the building.</Review>

I have afew words for the man and woman "cop" ... If you were in my shoes, would you help you?? Think about it!!. I sure hope they read this!!< /review>

I have been getting help from Tri-Cty since 2014 and I love this place. I love all the people that help me. I love Jamie Holes and Courageous Minds. I have had the opportunity to share my story many times. Shout out to Dr. T and therapist David for all their help. I highly recommend you getting help from this place. :)< /review>

Tri-City Wellness Center...
I place where I found hope and growth 🙏🏼
Not only has recovery taught me about being thankful, but I’ve discovered that recovery is easier when I’m thankful. When you don’t take life for granted, you automatically wake up and feel grateful. This makes recovery easier because you never want to lose that feeling. Recovery and gratitude are intertwined in that way.</review>

I I was able to start seeing a physician for my mental health condition. And my follow-up visits with my case manager. And doing this I now slowly have began treatment and therapy. And learning to get through some barriers that have been there. Very content with the services I have received from this office since day one.</text>< pics>

I gave birth here in Feb. 2021. The experience was awful.

They ran out of epidural when I was 9cm dilated and I was forced to wait over 90 minutes for the anesthesiologist to return from a different surgery to medicate me. I was told, “well, it’s Saturday.”

The c-section nurses were unprofessional and while I was panicking (sobbing/hyperventilating), they giggled and talked loudly about other things while they readied my body for the unexpected surgery. Then they forced a catheter inside of me without medication. I screamed “please stop!” over and over. They held me down and forced it in. No one explained to me why they needed to do this. It still haunts me. I’ve never lost my agency like that. It traumatized me.

In postpartum care, the nurses were unprofessional, irritable, and forgetful. The bathroom did not have a shower head, so I was told to use a hand wash cloth to bathe myself at the sink daily. This was after days of laboring. The nurses used my water bottle (for my privates) to clean the toilet when I used it. The bathroom floor was always wet and filthy. The second time I used the toilet, the nurse helped me get there, then said she had to see to something and would send someone to help me off. No one ever came.

The nurses told me that my breasts were “bad” for breastfeeding and insisted that I allow them to feed my daughter formula. I refused. One got so irritated, she watched me struggle to breastfeed, and when my daughter started crying, she said “See! She’s hungry!” Then she stormed out of the room. It was awful behavior. (My daughter has been successfully exclusively breastfed). The PP nurses were just awful.

I left after only 2 days in recovery (typical time for c-section is 4 days). The food was horrendous. The PP nurses were atrocious to me. The surgery was traumatizing. There are other hospitals on the west side to have your baby—don’t choose this one.<//Text>

<Text>Lied about wait times. Wait staff gave attitude to a guy when he tried to get details about how long he would have to wait: she used the phrase "if you want to believe that you can". I don't remember what she was referencing, I was just shocked that she was so rude to a guy who can barely walk and was so worried about his condition that he stayed in ER well into early hours of the morning.

They only had one ER doctor and an endless line of people.

Appaling that a hospital in such a wealthy state and such a wealthy city is too cheap to properly staff their facilities.<//Text>< response>

<text>My experience was great.  I was unsure about going to the Emergency Department, but happy I did as I got prompt attention, xrays right in my room with a portable device, and a good PA to diagnose and send me on my way with a support for the confirmed fracture.  I flagged down one of the nurses to please bring me water while I was waiting, and he did so.  Also, my wait was very short and all went smoothly.  Gave me a bone doc referral right down the street, able to make an appointment the next day to see.  On my way to healing.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I don't even know what to say. St. john's is the hospital my grandpa was tortured to death in. They failed his kidneys and put a tube down his throat without even giving him pain medicine and making sure he was comfortable. I can't even imagine the excruciating pain he went through.  The doctors and nurses have no respect or consideration for their patients. I wasn't able  to see him again after he entered the hospital but I saw this horrifying picture of him with his hands tied and eyes popping out of his face. It looked like a horror movie. I used to think that people became doctors and nurses because they cared about their patients well being, but now I can clearly see that is not the case. I wish I could leave 0 stars.<//text>

<review>Discharge employees like to threaten if you think your loved one needs to stay another day. They threatened me by saying I had to pay $2,500.00 a day if I wouldn’t pick her up. They don’t even know my full name so that won’t work. They can’t charge my mom as she’s a Medicaid recipient therefore it’s illegal to even attempt to charge her for medical services. Nice try though. Did you get your life’s frustrations out?</review></record></dataset><record>

Doctors and nurses are 5/5. Food on the other hand is absolutely disgusting and inedible. At Saint Johns, apparently its a nurses job to fetch food with your CC in hand because the abhorrent food and food service. What a waste of a nurses time and skills.

My OB, the incredible Dr. Tabsh, just moved to SJ, but If given the choice, I’d go back to UCLA to birth my (3rd) baby based solely on horrible food and food service from a recent surgery I had in L&D. Whomever is in charge might want to see the menu at UCLA and make changes at St. John’s stat. Expecting moms, beware. There isn’t even a menu or options, you get a tray. More like a county jail, not the premiere west side hospital in Los Angeles. Pathetic.<//Text>

Unnecessary pain and suffering of dying patients at the hands of uncaring and robotic ICU Drs and nurses.   We were in shock when Dr. Luigi in ICU stated our loved one's pain and discomfort was neither his priority or concern.  Don't expect palliative or hospice care at this hospital.<//Text><Time>1624032285797</Time><rating>1<//rating><user_id>107424767974781183794< /user_id></record>

<review>I recently had neurosurgery at St. John's from Dr. Khosla. Everything went so smoothly from scheduling, checking in, preop, surgery, postoperative, and room stay. All the nurses and assistants were amazing. My anesthesiologist called the night before, came in during preop, and even checked on me in my room the next day. This was my 13th major surgery and this experience was amongst the best. The facilities were excellent and I felt well cared for. Only suggestion would be for the food to be a bit higher quality.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

They lost my images that I sent them for appointment!!!! Even though I had a report that images were received by office staff they said that they have never saw my images. When I asked about a person who signed package they confirmed that this person is working in the office and usually pick up packages and said that they will investigate but they have never written me about my images again. I think they decided to ignore this situation. Very unprofessional office staff.< /Text>

I got my vaccines here, and had a *horrible* reaction.  I called them to ask if I should be concerned and they refused to help me.  They should have told me ahead of time what to do if the pain and fever were incapacitating, and when I called, they should have shown some interest, because I know they're required by law to report bad reactions, but because of how they brushed me off, I can't imagine they did.</text>

How can I express my appreciation for all the caregivers at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica. My 93 year old mother had a serious fainting episode and the wonderful service of the Santa Monica Fire Department and especially the awesome service and care from Jessica Brewer, PA and all the people that were involved in looking after mom. God bless our first responders, fire, police, doctors and nurses. They are angels on our backs!<//Review>

I recently had surgery at Saint John's and was so impressed with how caring, attentive and concerned for my comfort the entire staff was. This is particularly impressive in this time of rising Covid admissions.  Their professionalism and clear competence made something that could have been terrifying, a whole lot less scary.<//text>

Seriously HORRIBLE doctors and nurses on the oncology unit. They were incredibly unpleasant and unreliable. Kept making rude remarks/jokes about patients and laughed right in front of us. The nurses and care partners are lazy and miserable every day. Kindness is free, so please learn to have some compassion for sick patients and their families</Review>

The most selfish doctors and nurses I have ever come across. These people charged me $700 for a 30-day prescription of high blood pressure meds although I provided them with a valid MediCal id card. Currently I have a pending civil case against this bogus hospital. If you're low income, avoid at all cost or you may end up filing for bankruptcy!<//Text>

If I could give St. John's negative stars I would. Have been going to St. John's for over 30 years, used to receive excellent care. No more. The most uncaring, mean,  self centered staff I've ever seen. Horrible. They don't care about patients or care. Doctors are awful, nurses worse.

Stay away from this place if you value your life. They do not care about your health only profits. I would encourage you not to donate to St. John's either. This place and staff are HORRIBLE. All they care about is their bottom line.<//Review>

<text>I had endonasal surgery on June 2nd that went well and my neurosurgeon was great, but I had a terrible experience with the nursing staff. I felt that the nurses took advantage of the situation because my family members were not allowed to be there. Nobody was able to hold them accountable for their actions and to do their job. The intake nurse was terrible. She gave me her political commentary about “Killary” (you can’t make this up). She then proceeded to shave my arm and didn’t even put an IV in my arm and stuck it on my hand. When she wanted me to turn over my belongings (phone, clothes, etc.), I asked her if I could text my family real quick to let them know I’m not going to have my phone at that point going forward... she just snarled at me and gave attitude.

Once that hell was over, I eventually got into surgery and woke up into recovery. From there on out it was just a bad experience of nurses not answering calls and I simply just waited 30+ minutes for a response. My bladder was about to pop and I just had to wait for a nurse. They constantly had to be reminded to give me my medications. They left my bag on the dirty floor, never bothered to help me get anything, very rarely updated me about anything, and the list continues.

Upon recovery, they didn’t even have me walk to get blood flowing in my legs to prevent blood clots. I needed a MRI the following day after surgery and they spent hours upon hours leaving me in the dark about what was going on. I have medical devices in my body and they told me their radiology department requested a rep come out from Carlsbad to do an impedence test on my neurostimulator which had ZERO battery. Absolutely wasting hours upon hours of time. I just wanted to be discharged because of the god awful treatment and wanted to be back home with my family. Finally, they made me WALK OUT upon being discharged and not wheelchaired out. I don’t know if it’s because I am 29 years old and was on the first floor, but it was quite a thing to see.

If it were not for my neurosurgeon who only does surgeries there... I’d never go there. I highly suggest anyone who needs a surgery there to perhaps wait until you can bring a loved one in with you because their nurses cannot be trusted to do their job alone. They need to be held accountable because they don’t hold each other accountable.</text>< date>

<review>I don't know about other departments but 5 stars is for their maternity ward. I've visited several people there after they gave birth.  Even some of my friends were born there whose mothers would say the same thing that the service is outstanding.   Nurses are friendly.  Doctors are nice.  Most doctors are usually contracted and not regulars.< /review>< pictures>

Went to visit my friend grateful that he’s OK  Must say no one likes really visiting the hospital but it was so clean very religious but not creepy or offensive the doctors and the nurse had a great bedside manner. Saint johns hospital will definitely be in my prayers and hope they continue the good work</Text>

<review>Every single time i have to go to the ER at St. John's i have a warn and wonderful experience. Last weekend it was very busy. Even with that said, one of the volunteer workers brought me a sandwich and juice. The social worker Mel was very resourceful. And my Dr Bey, i wish we were related. She is an amazing doctor.
Thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart.<//review>< response>

I absolutely LOVE this hospital.. I was here for 9 days and the staff couldn't have been more amazing♡ I had a really difficult labor and my son ended up in the NICU. The labor & delivery team was great.. especially Josephine♡
I can't speak highly enough about the NICU nurses. Perry, Susie, Linda, Leo and many others were absolutely incredible. I was there day in and day out and was astonished at how patient, kind and knowledgeable these people were. This was an extremely difficult time for me and my family but my son couldn't have been in better hands. Many nurses had 20-30 years of experience and made sure that everything was done to ensure the safety and health of my baby. I'm so very grateful for St. John's♡<//review>

<review>My nose surgery was at St John's Ambulatory Surgery Center. Meghan the nurse who prepped me as I went in for surgery was very kind. She explained everything that she was doing and took much care to make sure that I was as comfortable as possible every step of the way. She also called me the day before the surgery with preparation instructions.

The surgery took 1.5 hours. Both Dr Kieu and my nurse each called my wife to tell her how the surgery went (smoothly) and when she could pick me up. Timeline for the day:
- arrived at 5:30
- surgery at 7
- recovery room at 8:45
- left at 10

I had three nose surgeries done all at once:
- septoplasty
- bilateral inferior turbinate reduction
- repair of nasal vestibular stenosis (bilateral) (using latera implants)

Excluding the cost for the surgeon, $12,432.66 was billed to my insurer (includes anesthesiologist, facility, drugs they pump into me before, during, and after surgery, etc). I paid much less than that, but that is what was billed to my insurer.

They tried to get me to pre-pay a massive amount to cover the maximum estimated cost I was expected to have to pay for the surgery, which I pushed back against since the fact that I was getting three surgeries done at once meant that I would likely get them at a discount since they shared 'overhead'. The person on the phone quickly gave in and said 'then what amount are you comfortable prepaying'? I told him '$400' and he was fine with that.

<review>Terrible ER service Saturday night.  Brought in by ambulance, given a room that wasn't clean, number 9.  Yet room had boxes of materials stacked on the counter.
Told I was discharged upon entering without an exam.  Given a G.I. cocktail and ordered to leave by nurse, no doctor.
The medical board will be notified.</review><Date>1515916522583<//Date>< Pics>

Walk to UCLA Santa Monica or Westwood . At least overthere it is reasonable to wait cause UCLA lobby is busy .< /text>

I spent 5 hours in the ER d/t extreme abdominal pain. While the doctor and registration staff was pleasant, the hospital nursing staff was inexcusably unprofessional, uncaring, and down-right dangerous. The first nurse put an IV and pressed on my vein constantly d/t slow blood flow. Then I noticed my arm was stinging and swelling up with fluid. She sent a phlebotomist in and he said he would go get her. NEITHER of them ever came back. My mom had to search for a nurse 45 minutes later and she stared at my swollen arm and said, "the last nurse didn't give you fluid so you shouldn't be bubbling. You should be fine." I proceeded to politely ask for her to take it out and asked if I would have my blood test completed....she replied, "oh, the doctor said you didn't need it." I had come in for pain and it literally took 3 hours to get my pain meds. I had to beg for some relief....later, (I won't give the gory details) I was trying to clean myself and asked for a nurse's help. As I was cleaning myself I got really dizzy and nauseous and almost fell. I was not wearing any bottoms and the nurse instructed me to walk to the restroom. I told her I couldn't walk and needed to sit and possibly throw up. She continued to instruct me to walk to the restroom. Btw, I came in a wheelchair because I couldn't walk.....After a few minutes of going back and forth with her, I asked her just to put a large pad on the bed so I could sit and asked for nausea medication. She came back 30 minutes later with a Rx and said she couldn't give me the medication because they had already discharged me....I am a typically positive person and I was polite to everyone involved, but if I can save someone the pain of going to their ER, then I believe it's worth posting.</text>

<review>I had an IV that actually just leaked, unfortunately not into my body. I think they try really hard here. The ER is basically an in and out type of place where they put a minimum bandaid on you.

If there is something wrong with you, by all means go find a doctor or you will be back to the ER.  This is not the ERs fault really. It is the fault of living in a world where those who pay for health insurance can't take time to use it to take care of their health and see a doctor and use the ER for a doctor only when something is desperately wrong.</review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Review>I like supporting local establishments. I've tried other pizzerias in NoHo and only happened to see this particular place when I walked by a small strip mall on the corner of Lankershim and Hesby. I must say, I loved both their Supreme and Cheese Lovers pizza! Whatever secret recipe sauce they use was awesome! So far, Lenzini's has catapulted to my #1. I'll continue trying other pizzerias just because I like to explore and discover new places BUT this will be my go-to for now until a better pizza place comes along.< /Review><userid>112320664548826591847<//userid>< Name>

The secret ingredient to lenzini's is they really care about making high quality pizza. And it's super affordable. The secret to eating at really good restaurants it's family run More family members the better the quality and service.< /text>< rate>

<Text>Lenzini's has the best pizza I've ever had, globally.  Pizza, for me, is a staple experience food.  I have pizza in every country, state, and providence I visit at least once, usually two or three times, just to experience the variety of flavors and home town favorites.

I can say without a shadow of a doubt, Lenzini's is my favorite with every pie I've had from them.  I don't even know what it is that they do but they're pretty incredible.

Moreover, every single time I have a friend come from out of town, I make it a point to get pizza here and every single person ends up being shocked and falls in love with the pizza they have here.

So yeah, don't be a fool and pass up an opportunity for some incredible pizza if you're in the area, you would seriously be missing out.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c295f45fae9ff5:0xde00bdf9a76e3c06< /Gmap_id></record>

I was ordering from this place sometimes 5 days a week. On this particular night the driver or walker gets lost. I literally live around the corner. I was not offered a fresh meal. Was told that it was not a big deal he was out there wondering around with my food. I asked for some sort of compensation the "manager" ask me what would I like i tell him. After I asked him what can he do and he gets an attitude and basically ask me do you want the food or not. First of all no. Waste your food and lose a loyal customer. ✌</Text><UserId.>103339130763922850445</UserId.>< Pics>

This restaurant is amazing! I've had almost everything on the menu but i love the spicy maninara pizza and meatballs. I've been coming here for a long time but Andrew O. was fantastic! Very attentive and made the experience special. Cheers.< /Review>

Best pizza all around!! I'm so happy to have finally found a pizza place I really love. The pizza tastes amazing and is not greasy at all. I always get the thin crust. All my friends and family love Lenzini's as well. Highly recommended!</Text>

Small shop but quality! My family loves their lasagna and it comes with cheesy garlic bread for less than $10. Parking can be difficult as the lot is small and local can be crowded but worth a try. Check their website for online ordering!</text>

Hi, hope this isn't posted for everyone to see, but the night I went in, the store was dirty and had a bad smell. I ordered a thin crust online and it wasn't what I ordered, it was regular crust. The guy that helped me seemed unsure of himself and didn't communicate well. Sorry, I'm not trying to be harsh, and appreciate the fact as the owner you want to know what was wrong so that you can fix it. I hope this is useful information. Best regards, Mike</Text>

<text>Pizza crust was good. Didn't like the vegan cheese they used though.
Nice little spot, but was turned off by the employee that kept smoking right outside the open front door...not a fan of second hand smoke, especially when dining.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Rate>

<user>104995425155244591579<//user><Resp>None< /Resp><Text>Ever since I tried their mushroom pizza on a thin crust with white sauce I am a regular customer! The pizza crust is the best part, crunchy and not greasy... The sandwich breads are good too. Yummy mozzarella sticks and potato sides. Very fresh lettuce in my favorite caesar salad…The delivery guys are very polite and quite on time though some weekend nights it takes a little longer to get the food but still you’ll get it hot and crunchy… reliable place to order food in advance for your gatherings and events…..no matter how many pizzas you ask for, always hot and delicious!</Text>< Name>

They have the best gluten free crust around and their supreme has an awesome amount of toppings.
Parking can be an issue though, bring someone to run inside if you're picking up.< /Text>

<text>On a budget this place can't be beat. This is not a posh dive bar. Its a pizza joint. If you want small portions and large prices go somewhere else. I get salad,pizza and hot wings for 2 under $20 bucks. Not bad for a Tuesday.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Best pizza in North Hollywood

Update June 2018
Now that I've been coming here as a regular the quality of the pizza has dropped, the crust tastes old as well as the ingredients  it's just never been the same since I've been coming, sadly I will return and I'm really disappointed about that</Text>< Gmap_id>

<response>None</response><Text>This was the second dealership we stopped at in our search for a new (to us) truck. They have a nice sized lot, crammed full of nice clean vehicles. Tyler helped us check out a couple trucks and we took one on a test drive within the first 15 minutes there. We decided we liked it and went in to get the financing process going. Our credit isn't the greatest but they negotiated with the finance company to get us a payment that fit within our budget. The staff was friendly and accommodating and really worked as a team so we could drive off the lot with our new (to us) truck.<//Text>< username>

<rate>5</rate><Review>If you're looking to get a vehicle or do a trade in, Autoworld 805 is the place to go. My family and I went all over town to different dealerships and decided that Autoworld 805 was the place for us. They had the exact vehicle I wanted which alot of the other dealerships didn't and they had a few to pick from. All the staff is great ​i worked with Misael one of the car salesman's there and he was amazing throughout whole process I highly recommend you guy stop by and see him but if he's not there any other staff members is as great and as wonderful of assistant's. The manager Erick really help alot aswell. Why go anywhere else, do yourself a favor and stop by. You can all thank me later : ) .< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I came in looking a vehicle that was honestly impractical for my wants and needs, I was helped by the owner frank, and sales manager John, they helped me find the perfect vehicle for me, a beautiful grand Cherokee! And gave me an incredible deal, they were helpful and kind through the whole process. I will be sending my family here to upgrade when it’s time. Keep up the good work guys 👏<//text>

After my father had a great buying experience there that I'm sure, knowing my father wasnt easy, I decided to see them.  I'm glad that I did.  At no point did I feel pressured throughout the whole buying process.  I got the vehicle that I wanted for less than I had planned to spend at a monthly payment that was more than affordable.  GIVE THESE GUYS A SHOT< /review>

<Review>Well if your looking to a buy your first car or a car in general, I'd recomend going here for a couple reasons, first off the staff was very friendly and we discussed my financial situation and how I was a first time buyer looking for help on what I can get. Secondly they did everything to make sure I got the car that same day they followed up to make sure everything was ok and if I was satisfied with how the car is. They were very friendly over all and gave me a great discount I'd recommend going there, for me when I buy a second car that's where ill be going again.</Review>< pictures>

<time>1552772575453</time><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Worst experience in my entire life.These guys will take your car back, keep your money, call the cops, and then re sell the car over and over again....Just look at the one star ratings below that they are trying to hide...Don't make the same mistake I've made..I tried to get my down payment back, but they used the Santa Maria police to escort me out. Sam and Mike are liars and lie about everything..I even brought these guys a referral who bought a car and I was supposed to get a referral bonus which of course was never honored...The only thing I received from these guys is a near trip to jail and my money stolen. All of the 5 star reviews are fake posts..These guys are crooks and to make matters worse Sam made some inappropriate comments torwards my girl friend..we were burnt , threatened , and violated...if u want to get screwed go buy from autoworld.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Only buy from these crooks if you’re really desperate cause they seem to be able to finance anybody.... Bought a Jeep Patriot from these guys and I was told it was a local trade in and I had no reason to doubt them (YET) even though it was squeeking everywhere, So I take it to Camarena’s Tires today to have it checked and they called me an hour later to go look at something on the Jeep. I went under the jeep so he can explain to me and I couldn’t believe my eyes it is so rusty and rotted! A Carfax states that the jeep is from Montana not California like I was told!!!!

Did not try to hard sell. Friendly service. Allowed us to look around. Had to have escort while looking around. ಠ﹏ಠ
Prices were kinda high but all appliances were new.
Some prices were really high. Over 6000 for a refrigerator! 4000 for a stove/oven.</text>

< Review>
The personnel at Ventura TV Video Appliance Center recommended the perfect washer and dryer that met my needs and budget.  I couldn't be happier with the purchase and installation.  I'm 77 years young and can remember our family dealing with this store for about as long as I can remember.  If we weren't happy with our purchases,  we wouldn't have kept coming back.  100% happy customer.< /Review>

<user_name>melissa eliosa<//user_name><text>I will only give then 2 stars because the salesman was nice and he was very informative for the most part. What they failed to tell me was that the mail in rebate for the product that I bought was only for Fresno or Clovis people I don't live in that town. So I had just have to eat the $100 extra that I got when I could have gone to BestBuy or a larger manufacturer and got it a lower price. I chose to go to Ventura TV because they were more of a mom and pop and not a big chain which was I was trying to avoid but shame on me I guess I'll just have to stick with the Big Chain sometimes because now it cost me $100<//text>< pics>

The store is very clean, but they really need more sales people we were there for approximately 20 minutes, we were greeted when we walked in and that was it, they were busy with another customer, then they didn't have the merchandise that was advertised on sale on the floor, it wasn't until we were walking out that a very nice young man asked if we found what we needed, I understand that the pandemic has hurt all businesses but they could have at least said I'll be with you in a moment< /text>

Would not recommend, bought a dryer that was damaged and since Samsung would not cover through warranty they left me with a damaged dryer that was just “new”. Not to mention Samsung technician did say this was not there first issue with this store. Ridiculously bad customer service very rude have never experienced this customer service in any other store. Money to the trash would rather go to Home Depot or another store.<//text>

I'm 67 and have lived in Fresno all my life. Yet I had never bought from Ventura. What a mistake that was. I like the work they do with the ME tv channel. So I wanted to buy my next appliance from them. My fifty year old single wall oven finally died. I bought a 30" frigidare wall oven from them. They had it at a great price, their competitors didn't come close.  The sales people were very friendly and helpful as were the ones who delivered it. I recommend them to any one who needs new appliances. I just wish I had used them many years earler.</Text>

We purchased a 65 inch LG led tv earlier this month, they had to hold it because we could not get a stand for it during the covid-19 shutdown. When the time came for delivery, they were very prompt, their installation team was the best that I have experienced in over 50 years. The installer was courteneous and very efficient. They had to haul off my old projection TV, no problem. I do recommend Ventura for all your appliance and TV needs. They provide top customer service, which is lacking in some of the big box stores. DEFINITELY A 5 STAR RATING.I will not hesitate to check with Ventura first when I need an appliance before I go to the big box stores, who in my opinion lack (personal) service<//Text>

{'time': 1577749736519, 'text': "Hello Beth,\n\nThank you for sharing this.  We regret that you have had a poor experience with a product you purchased from our store.  Please know that we value and appreciate all of our customers and will do our best to correct the situation.  With that in mind, I would like to address some of the points you have made.\n\nTo your point of not wasting your money with Ventura TV because we sell broken units, this is not correct.  The refrigerator we sold you was brand new and shipped to us directly from the manufacturer.  However, it had a manufacturer’s defect unbeknown to us.  While this is not common, it does occasionally happen.\n\nAs with any new item purchased, products are prone to have manufacturer defects, as was the case with your new refrigerator’s valve.  It is for situations like this that manufacturer’s provide a warranty.  While it is normally your responsibility to contact the manufacturer directly for warranty related issues, our customer service associate contacted the manufacturer on your behalf in order to help facilitate the warranty service.  The manufacturer contacted Bauman's Appliance & Air Conditioning Repair, their authorized, local service provider, to come out and service your refrigerator.  Ventura TV did not hire or contact Bauman’s for the service.\n\nAfter receiving your complaint, we contacted Bauman’s to get more details.  We learned that your refrigerator valve was indeed defective and was replaced.  We also learned that the copper pipe leading to your refrigerator’s water line was extremely old, bent, improperly installed and cemented in with your floor tiles, making it more prone to damage during a routine installation.  We were also informed that you were told at the time of service by Bauman’s technician that the broken line was a result of poor plumbing and that the repair required a plumber, a service which Bauman’s does not offer. Since the line was broken, the technician shut off your water valve in the kitchen to prevent any flooding.  Any further issues regarding the broken line should be directed to Bauman’s, as Ventura TV has no involvement or authority in this situation.\n\nAs for your doors being misaligned upon replacement by Ventura TV’s installers, we have already contacted you and scheduled a technician to come to your home tomorrow to adjust them.\n\nOnce again, we regret that you have had this poor experience and will do our best to assist in any way possible.  As always, we value your business and hope you would consider shopping with us again in the future.\n\nKind regards,\n\nAra Catchatoorian\nPublic Relations / Marketing Director\nVentura TV Video Appliance Center, Inc."}< /resp>

< Review>
I purchased a Brand new refrigerator with an ice maker and water dispenser and the first day it leaked water all over my kitchen floor. It had a bad value in the unit.. It took 2 days s to get a repair man out to fix it. The repair push the refrigerator back and bent my copper line and again I had water all over my floor. He shut off the water under my sink and left. It’s wasn’t he problem and did care that he broke it. It wasn’t that way before and didn’t care. I also notice my doors are uneven which they removed before bringing my house. I called Ventura 2 days ago and they were going to schedule a technician. It’s been 2 days and no call back. I was going to buy a new washer and dryer from them but not anymore.  Bay man appliance and air conditioning repair guy is horrible attitude  is so sad to bad.. unfortunately it’s nobody’s problem. Don’t waste your money on new appliances because there broke units.< /Review>

Great service, easy online purchase.  I was able to shop online, purchase a refrigerator with the assistance of online chat (Cyndi), and she set up delivery and pick of old refrigerate without even leaving my office.  I strongly recommend Ventura TV.  I love shopping local.< /Review>

<Review>Prices are very high. I was walking around the place for several minutes before a sales man ask what I wanted
Directed me to the refrigerators but walked away and helped another couple. Didn't talk to me again. I need to buy a new refrigerator but I think I'll go to Sears or Lowe's or home place else where  Single ladies get help. Rude as far as I'm concerned!</Review></record>

<Text>Very helpful sales staff.  They don't push you to buy anything, but are glad to spend time with you answer questions and let you make up your mind as to what you need.  I recently purchased a TV and an antenna from them.  They gave me great advice on the install of the antenna, which turned out to be very easy. Both work great.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I went there earlier today to buy a refrigerator, the customer service was friendly and extremely helpful, with financing available if needed, the application process was quick and painless and we walked out new fridge in hand, in under 20 minutes.</text>

Do not buy anything from this company!!!!  We purchased a refrigerator that was defective.  From the moment it was in our home and plugged in, it made a load noise and constantly sound like it was going to shut-down.  Ventura TV would not honor the warranty.  The service man who came out said the compressor was broken and the cooper tubing.  Yet, Ventura TV will not replace an obviously defective appliance.  They are unapologetic. In speaking to others, I find out that I'm not first person who has been taken by these con artist.  DO NO SHOP HERE!!!!< /Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I live near woodward park.  The antenna installed on my roof is not better than the "as seen on tv" antenna.  I cannot get channel 18, and the other channels are choppy and studder the reception.  I've had Ventura TV out to fix, and instead of moving the antenna, they stated I needed to chop down a Japanese Maple.  I called xfinity, and am going back to cable.
I am so disappointed, really wanted to cut the cable, but the family needs TV.  I live in the city of Fresno!  should not have been so difficult to get an outdoor antenna installed that works.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><user>113422971349951401619</user><Resp>{'time': 1534179710029, 'text': "Hi JD, thanks for your feedback.  We're sorry to hear you were not happy with our service.  Unfortunately, when it comes to broadcast antenna service, there are several variables that effect your signal and every channel does not broadcast at the same strength, frequency, or from the same broadcast tower.  Our installers are trained experts in this field and do their best to offer the solution that best fits your location.  Unfortunately, trees and other obstructions combined with your property vicinity are sometimes factors in receiving optimal signal.  Also, it may be that channel 18 was experiencing technical difficulties at the time of installation.  Hopefully, you have not gone back to paid TV/cable service as we realize in today's economy, this can become a burden with some families.  Should you still need our assistance or would like to explore other options that may possibly work (we are always getting in new antenna models), please don't hesitate to give us a call at (559) 265-4326 Monday - Saturday 9am-6pm.  Thanks for shopping with us and we hope to hear back from you!   - Ara Catchatoorian, Marketing Director"}</Resp>< date>

Bought what I thought was a new maytag washing machine, 16 months later I found out through maytag that I had bought a used maytag washer machine. The machine had a service record in 2 different states and a service record in Canada and now the machine is locked in thr lock position and will not allow thr machine to turn on. I confronted Ventura about my finding and ask for my $519 dollars back. They refuse to give me my money back. But would give me a different washer machine or have mine repaired. Very shameful for a company to try and make the customer feel at fault for there wrong doings, instead of accepting responsibility by placing the customer first and doing any and everthing to have a happy customer in the field promoting your company instead of having a disgruntle customer telling people to stay as far away as possible from Ventura TV and Appliances. Lowes, Home Depot, Sears, you name it would not do this to there customers. Specially knowing with documentation that they sold a used appliance as new. Not Ventura. Bold, lie cheat or steal for $519 dollars. Penny wise pound foolish. They need to be sued, but not sure there level of intelligence would comprehend even that.</Text>

<response>{'time': 1527105803180, 'text': 'Dear Mr. Moles,\n\nI would like to thank you for shopping with Ventura TV Video Appliance Center and apologize for the \xa0inconvenience you have experienced with your Maytag Bravos top-load washer (serial ending XXXXX033). I have read your review, conferred with our store manager and the Whirlpool/Maytag Service Center and would like to address a few points.\n\nThe Maytag washer that you purchased on 3/19/16 was new in factory SEALED box and had a 1 year manufacturer\'s warranty from the date of purchase. \xa0Therefore, a failure or problem that arises 16 months after your purchase is out of warranty and subject to repair costs (parts & labor). You asked for a free service call and we gave you the phone number to Maytag customer experience center, where occasionally they accommodate consumer\'s request by providing free parts and reduced labor costs.\n\nI understand that when you contacted the Maytag customer experience center regarding your repair, they erroneously gave you the repair history of another machine that was performed in Canada and Maine. When you brought this to the attention of \xa0our store manager, he went above and beyond his required service for out-of-warranty product repairs by negotiating with our with our Maytag rep to authorize a brand new unit of your choice at no cost to you. You chose one, we set up delivery for 7/22/17. Two days later you refused the delivery of the new washer. Upon your refusal the manager contacted the service center himself to address your claim that you were sold used merchandise. Upon providing accurate model and serial information, the service center did confirm that no repairs had been made on your unit and for your inconvenience they\'d consider repairing your washer free of charge despite it being out of warranty.\n\nI called the service center and Rita, the rep with whom I spoke, verified that you had initially called in with the correct serial number, provided an incorrect model number. \xa0She stated that the service center had noted in their system "Service bench lists several different models" indicating that there is more than one model number that shares that same serial number. \xa0The service center requires both serial number and model number when authorizing repairs. \xa0The rep also stated that upon discovering that they had provided you with incorrect information, the service center left a message for you at the number we have listed on file as your residence in order to inform you that they had given you incorrect information and that your unit had no history of repair. The message was left on July 27, 2017 at 2:54PM.\n\nIn regards to your demand for a refund, it is not our policy to provide a refund for merchandise that is 16 months old. However we feel that we went over and above our duty to accommodate you with a new machine, this offer still stands. Or you can call Maytag at 800-253-1301 and they indicated that they will repair the washer that you have at no cost to you. \xa0This is the advantage of dealing with locally owned, manufacturer authorized, independent retailers such as Ventura TV Video Appliance Center.\n\nLastly, in regards to your claim that Ventura TV Video Appliance Center has devious and malicious business practices, I have not found anything in my research of your incident that indicates foul play. \xa0Our managers and staff are held accountable for their actions and any complaints about our service or the products we sell are taken very seriously.\n\nI sincerely apologize for your inconvenience and hope that you are able to come to a resolution with the service center. \xa0As always, we appreciate your business and hope that this explanation will offer you some reassurance that we are here to help and that you are valued as our customer.\n\nKind regards,\n\nAra Catchatoorian\nMarketing & Communications Manager\nVentura TV Video Appliance Center, Inc.'}< /response></record>

Have you actually shopped at the store?  Yes, we are always running sales, but I assure you everything is not "on sale".  We have thousands of products.  We\'re a local electronics and appliances retailer that has competed against the Big Box stores, many of which are not even around anymore, effectively by offering some of the lowest prices on brand new name-brand products in the Central Valley, all backed by our Price Beat Guarantee and 115% After-the-Sale Protection.  It\'s posted on our site at http://www.venturatv.com/en/pg-Price-Matching-Warranty and on every price tag in our store.  If ANY retail competitor in Fresno County offers a lower price on an in-stock model, please bring it to our attention prior to the sale and we will cheerfully BEAT that local competitor’s price... on the spot!  Should you have any questions about a product or our guarantee, please don\'t hesitate to contact us at (559) 265-4326.  We\'d be happy to help!  Thanks!'}<//resp><GmapID>0x80945e4709ad9fe7:0x1b15a741951c1976<//GmapID></record>

<Text>Sometimes this gas station has prices that are cheaper than other ones in the area, but that lately has not been true. Down the street about a mile is a narco and across the street from that as a 7-Eleven and they have been having cheaper prices than this place. Usually that's not too bad, they have a small store attached for your usual drinks and goodies and snacks.<//Text><Time>1560994370503<//Time>< Pictures>

I’m new to vaping, so I don’t know a lot about prices for what this stuff goes for. This shop sold me a vape kit for about $70, which sounded right to me. But I found out a couple days later that they go for about $35 everywhere else.

Huge disappointment. Pro tip if you want to shop here, check prices elsewhere else first.<//text>

<review>I love this place the service is excellent food cooked and served in a timely fashion Most importantly there's a gentleman that words their name Jesse and he is the best customer service/waiter I've ever seen and I eat out quite a bit the cook was having problems keeping up so Jesse went back and help him out and cooked our meal personally I gave him a nice tip and he tried to hand it back and said you don't have to do that and I said yes I do because no one has ever given me service or waited on me and my woman the way you have if you go to Denny's on Santa Rosa Avenue make sure you asked for Jesse everybody else there is great too but hes definitely a step above everyone else<//review>< name>

The waitress was working the floor alone. However, she was very attentive, organized and pleasant to even one patron who was being grouchy. And every time I wanted anything, she was available. Kudos.<//review>

Cook was new. How do you ruin eggs? Scrambled? Paid for 4 eggs, only got 2. Cook was already flustered. Didn't complain.< /review>

Terrible experience, they left me waiting for long time claiming that was because I order a hot sandwich and after 17 minutes  my sandwich wasn't  even made so I had to take it cold because I have to go back to work.<//Review>

<name>Hanna Bello<//name><Text>If I could give one star I would. I ordered delivery on the Denny's app.  It said that it would be here in 20 minutes. That was at 10 o'clock a.m. it is now 11:13 am.  I called the store because my food is not here and I'm told that the delivery man has not arrived yet. I asked how my supposed to know when he arise she said I could call you. I get off the phone I'm trying to find the number through the app to try to figure out what's going on. I check my email and it says pick up on it even now IA chosen delivery. It then tells me if there's any issues to call the store. They said they will not give me a refund even though it has been over an hour and for me to just come and pick it up. Uhm no it has been sitting there for an hr. Worst experience ever.</Text>< Time>

So disappointed they forgot our pancakes. The girl was sp nice and has agreed to let us pick up our pancakes tomorow morning. Frustrating expierence. Took half hour to f ok naly.reach the store employees to ask a out our missing pancakes. Glad she offered I'd to pick them up tomorow. Sad we did.t get ti eat pancakes this morning when that's what we really wanted. Luckily our mom had gotten her pancakes so she shared with us to calm the crave. This location seemed to be owing covid quidelands for the most part. And I was very pleased to see the covid plan the store has agreed to follow taped near front dlr for customers to view, very nice. Good work.</Review>

<text>UPDATED.....This place has got to be the worst food inhabited building..Upon arriving the jive box was playing music loud enough for a bar. There was not one paying customer inside and no employees either. We said hello about 4 times 2 of them being loudly spoken all within 10 mins. Finally someone came from the back. Not 1 but 2 workers. After they took our order they disappeared again..and again....not counting my food was over cooked due to rushing or distraction. My order was even missing a pc a bacon. Bacon aint cheap. Needless to say i shall never return. I FOUND THAT VIDEO I TOOK UPON WALKING IN DENNYS...CHECK IT OUT..REDONKULOUS< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3lyoLsYeMnslnzrA-jl3lhzvw8jphnAPRY9cI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOVrmTljEoczkmOTTM4DVGn_s_2Zpot16qTxSG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPG0CdC4wsJOQusOi-DhlKEyIWt-G8lx-xTlHG_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< rating>

<rate>5< /rate><text>I've been coming here for years, and the only reason I give it 4 stars is because  a while
someone drops the ball. But over all I really like this place. Takes me back 50 years. It's the same as it was back then  in Southern California the same as it is elsewhere in the country and it's a good  formula that works. Thank you Denny's , for being consistently and reliably above average and enjoyable. (In conclusion I raised Stars to 5 because some of the wait staff really deserve 5+++!)<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>Denny's on Baker St( at the freeway entrance, hwy.101) was good;although, it was long wait. Good for talking and coffee, but if you are in a hurry, choose another Denny's. The food is good. They really helped out our first responders during the kincade fire and am proud to have experienced Denny's great dedicated services. We always come back.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x8084481f16a6433f:0x9aaae0d03f753cce<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It took a while for us to get our food. Honestly I would have rated a lot lower but the guy tending us tonight did an amazing job. He was serving and helping in the kitchen. We weren't the only table but he made sure to make his rounds letting everyone know they weren't forgotten.< /Text>

<Review>Located on The Main Thoroughfare of Santa Rosa, CA. Aptly Named Santa Rosa Ave. Chevron Gas Station Shares The Parking Lot. Easy Off and On To Interstate 101 North. The Service is a little Slow, But The Prices Are Hard To beat for a Sit-Down Restaurant. Sometimes The Parking Lot is Jammed With Cars.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Location is at the back on the left of the center it's in so while you can see the sign from the street, you can't see the restaurant itself. Plenty of up front disabled parking.
I went on my birthday for my free build your own grand slam breakfast. They're the only place I found that you don't have to sign up in advance for your free birthday meal. So no pesky texts from them!
Staff was very friendly and have a loyal clientele. Food is delicious and served without a long wait.< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Nothing better than a Grand Slam late at night to break up a long drive. The service was helpful and friendly. The only thing keeping it from 5 Stars was that the floors had a movie theater like stickiness to them. I believe they were simply busy and hadn't had a chance to take care of them.<//Text>

< Review>
This Denny's has had a interior refurbishment and is much more up to date. Now if they could just do something about the exterior. Especially that cracked window by the front door. That being said, the food was pretty good. I mean it's Denny's. They make a good breakfast and a pretty good burger. I just wish they had regular french fries. The sliced potato things they serve as fries are not crispy and just are not as good as regular french fries. All in all though a good place for a decent meal.</Review>

Excellent service.Great music program in there jukebox.
The. Best after hours place that you can go to especially when everything else is closed.
If they could get garden 🍔 burgers on the menu that would be a wise choice over there Bean patty Burgers.<//review>

I walked out of this place we had a 50 minute wait for very simple meals the place wasn't very crowded and to top it all off they got my order completely wrong. When he offered to switch it I said there's no way I'm waiting any longer than we already have and I walked out. Another problem is that the place has no air conditioning on a hot summer night you can feel it in there it made it more unbearable even though I was starving and considered waiting for my corrected order to be made the temperature in this Denny's seemed to be about 95°.<//Review>

< review>
Awful experience. I have never felt so uncomfortable and unwelcomed in my life. I came in with my bi-racial family and we were already getting dirty stares from the waiter.. who didn't even care to acknowledge or serve us. He had a younger female seat us. After putting in my daughter's order, not once did she come check on us to take the rest of our order. Once our food was served nobody cared to ask us for refills on coffee or water. Truly terrible customer service here. Most definitely will be contacting headquarters to report the judgemental and god honest racist atmosphere at this location.</review>

<text>Stuffy, smelly, too warm and the food definitely doesn't smell good. The staff look unhappy which means they are not treated well by management. The place is rundown, carpet stained, dirty, the booths torn up, and the tables scarred. It feels like the company has even given up on this poor restaurant. Just go to a different diner. You'll be happy you did.< /text><gmapID>0x8084481f16a6433f:0x9aaae0d03f753cce</gmapID><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

No one does breakfast like Denny's!! You can't beat the prices or the food for that matter!! 2 4 6 8 menu is fun as well. I order everything on the 2 dollar menu. You get so much food when you do that. The service is good too. Just tip well.< /text>

Our visit was during the evacuation for fires in Santa Rosa. I feel sorry for this place because they were understaffed but they did as good as they possibly could and we had a decent meal. Hats off to Denny's for making life a little brighter on this horrible day.</review>

<review>Awful experience. I have never felt so uncomfortable and unwelcomed in my life. I came in with my bi-racial family and we were already getting dirty stares from the waiter.. who didn't even care to acknowledge or serve us. He had a younger female seat us. After putting in my daughter's order, not once did she come check on us to take the rest of our order. Once our food was served nobody cared to ask us for refills on coffee or water. Truly terrible customer service here. Most definitely will be contacting headquarters to report the judgemental and god honest racist atmosphere at this location.<//review>< pictures>

<review>This Denny's was better than the one on Guerneville Road which the other day we walked in and they were kind of rude.

<Text>Well Denny's is Dennys and in this case is true to it's franchise model. This restaurant/ diner lives up to all the qualities of the brand providing a larger, affordable number of menue options, including 24 hour breakfasts menue both delivered with a fast, clean service. The food tast of my meal was very good as advertised and the presentation and service way above average for the chain in genera meaning a very friendly helpful waitress who I tipped 25%.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>costumer service was very slow, i never want to come back, the menu made everything look so good but when i got my food there was barely anyhting on my plait, and the employees ignored me half the time. It Is way to expensive for what they gave me. 2 little chicken strips and a couple of fries for $12.99 and gave me a cup of Sprite that had no flavor and tasted like sparkling water. They switched our cups around while refilling them. Our cup was more ice than soda because they were running out of soda . This was my terrible experience for my birthday, I was really looking forward to having a delicious meal with my family but sadly I went to this dennys 🥺. I hope you have a better a experience than I did on my birthday<//Text>< pictures>

<review>For the type of place this is, its actually not bad. The waitress who served me was running around and very busy but did check on me twice. If you want a familiar place while on a road trip this place is right off the freeway. If you want to experience a good local option keep looking.< /review><Rate>4<//Rate><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Right now, my favorite breakfast is at Denny’s. I really like biscuits and gravy and they do a fine job. In addition, the waiter at the Cleveland Ave restaurant is really friendly and attentive.<//Text>

DENNYS IS LIT. the staff definitely all smoke cigarettes and you could tell that everyone in there besides me was a regular to the establishment because the staff knew everyone by name. The food was amazing (I've never been to a denny's as I used to consider myself and IHOP man before tonight). They were "out" of a few things, this seemed to be an obvious hint that the staff simply didnt want to make the requested item (a smoothie) but that's alright. My body fat percentage was happy enough to go without the additional calories and I happily made out alright with a simple ice water. I got the hazelnut crepes and it was no surprise to anyone that the hazelnut was just nutella (that's alright tho, I loved it). Basically, my takeaway here is that this place is exactly what you would expect, a fairly low budget seat-in, breakfast and pancake place where the staff is friendly enough, the atmosphere warm enough and the food, good enough. Theres little to no surprises when eating here when you keep in mind that the staff are people too who are just trying to make a living, just are you are trying to continue living (by eating)(<<<<that was a joke, I'm sure it landed great). Anyway, I'm not sure anyone will actually read this but this entire message was all a ploy to get google to reward me for writing a long review about a restaurant and I felt like making a long review about a low risk business would be the right move. So yeah, please stop reading this now. Also, just in case you are still reading, Epstein didnt kill himself.<//text>

< review>
WE OWN OUR BUSINESS & WHEN WE WORK DENNY'S IS USUALLY THE ONLY RESTAURANT THAT'S OPEN. I HAVE HAD DECENT MEALS BUT THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!
NINA IS THE BEST & THE MOST SWEETEST WAITRESS I HAVE HAD IN A LONG TIME & SHE MUST BE PHYSIC BECAUSE SHE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED & SIDES.
I COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR ANYTHING MORE, WHEN I GO OUT TO EAT I WANT TO ENJOY MYSELF & NOT BE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE MY FOOD OR SERVICE WAS CRAPPY!
THANK YOU NINA!!!
OH BY THE WAY JESSIE THE COOK IS THE BOMB!! HE IS AN AWESOME COOK,MY FOOD CAME OUT AMAZING.
THE MANAGER & OWNER IS LUCKY TO HAVE THESE 2 AMAZING PEOPLE WHO ARE GREAT AT THEIR JOBS.
I LOVE YOU GUYS I AM A LOYAL CUSTOMER WHO WILL BYPASS EVERY DENNY'S TO COME HERE.< /review>

<time>1509429188573</time><Rating>2</Rating><Review>10/29/17 And they finally lost me as a customer. Letting a dog in was my limit not a service dog just some homeless guy and his dog. I'm ok with pretty much everyone not everyone is as fortunate as I am but the dog really really bothers​ me.

I have a family member who loves this place. But tonight  was  about my limit. We are sitting there waiting for our food and in walks to his guy AND his dog. Not a service dog, This guys pet. A larger sized mixed breed dog that really needed a bath.. I'm sorry but no that is not cool. I waited for someone who works there to ask him to please tie the dog outside to a tree  it's not like there's not a lot of space to do this. But no the guy gets seated in the big part of the dining room with the dog. I don't think that this is sanitary. I'm sure the health Dept frowns on dogs in eating establishments. Jeez, I go out and expect the place I'm eating at to be clean, have good  food and to be free of animals. Especially dogs that aren't that clean.  The fact that the dog was allowed in at all  makes me kinda ill feeling. The place is already doesn't look clean. I think that's because it is so time worn. It needs updating desperately.

10/24/17  It was clean as far as I could tell but it just feels like it's been neglected by Denny's corporate. Too bad. It's in such a great location and if it was updated I'm sure it would be a great place to eat. As it is now, I got my food to go.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x8084481f16a6433f:0x9aaae0d03f753cce</GmapID></record>

<Text>I'm a Postmates driver. I waited at the cash registers upon entering the restaurant 7 minutes before seeing or hearing an employee, and then when I finally noticed someone (possibly the only person working) he barely acknowledged my presence and instead of making his way over to the registers he decided to flirt with a table he was waiting on. Finally he made it over to greet me and had no idea what I was requesting when I explained to him that I was attempting to pick up an order for Postmates. He eventually asked if I was with "one of those online order services". I said yes, and gave him my order number. He looked back at the server window and said, "well that must be the order right there". I quickly grabbed the bags he handed to me and proceeded with my delivery.</Text>< Pics>

Well here is why I gave them a 1 star. My niece ordered a roast beef sandwich which had onions and mushrooms both which she hates. I asked the server to order us another one without onions and mushrooms. We NEVER asked for it to be free, we had intentions to pay for the dish, taken it home and eat it later. The supervisor who's name is Isabel, asked the server out loud "Why are you ordering another one?? Did you mess up?" The server kindly said "Oh,  no. The girl doesn't want onions or mushrooms" the woman then instructed our server to grab the plate my niece wasn't going to eat and throw it away. It blew my mind that she automatically assumed we weren't going to pay for it! It angered me and ruined my meal. Never again. Worst supervisor ever!!< /review>< Pics>

The waitress has a voice that can be heard a mile away. The management here might think that's funny, but we don't. We came here to enjoy a breakfast, not have our eardrums assaulted by sudden outbursts of an irritating voice.
Not only was her voice obnoxious, she talked so long with her friends that she left our breakfast in the chef's window until it got cold.
Then the pancakes were burnt and cold.
Do yourself a favor a go somewhere else to eat.
It was a very unpleasant experience.</text>

I don't know why we kept going back to this location.  It's always dirty. Most of the staff are rude. They never get our order right even though they read it back. They take FOREVER for the food to be served. The last time we were there we waited over an hr  for our food. My son's  fries & chicken strips were burnt. When i okjnformed the waiter he looked at me like i was stupid & it want his problem. I asked for no whipped cream on his shake they put extra!

They other location is cleaner but the wait time for service & food is horrible but the staff are great once they actually come to help.</Text>

The waitress wasn't personable at all. She couldn't answer questions about either of our orders.
Then I let her know that I was taking my daughter to the bathroom,  but the manager cleaned our table while we were gone! They replaced our food but didn't seem very apologetic. The manager (I'm assuming hes the manager) acted like it was such an inconvenience to replace the food that he had just thrown away. Then they didnt even give us a discount for having to wait for our food twice! Terrible service. Will not be back<//Review>

She helped us right away and the Danny's is right off the freeway, now this place seems like it's an older Denny's but the food was good and quick the placewas not busy for being 6:30 am which was good. One thing that I noticed when my friend ordered coffee the mug had lipstick and he was drinking it already hahaha sick!.. I told the lady about the mug and she took it immediately and apologized and that's why you always ask for a yo go cup for the coffee duh!. Good place and good experience and yes every Time anyone eats out well we all take a major risk at things. But Yes I Would definitely go there again just because of the lady's friendly help</Text></record>

<review>What can I say? Dennys menu choices have become a bit weird. Too many bizarre flavored waffles and whatnot for my taste. But the value menu is pretty good. Shakes are great. Service seems to vary from time to time depending on who is working and if its real busy or not. Open 24/7 is good. Thats a buisness model that seems to be dying out & I'm a night owl.
With few exceptions this location has always been, not always great, but a good dining experience.<//review><userid>109903913573065566256</userid><gmapID>0x8084481f16a6433f:0x9aaae0d03f753cce<//gmapID><Rate>3< /Rate>< pictures>

I feel like everyone already knows what to expect as far as the quality of food you get at Denny's, so my review and rating is based on service.
With that said, I've always been served promptly and the servers I get have been attentive for the most part.  Overall, I have very little negative to say about the service I receive there.  One star removed for a lack of attention to restroom upkeep.  I've seen and (unfortunately) used worse but the bathroom is neglected.< /Review>

Since management changed back to the good guys, and they fired some really bad waiters and waitresses and cooks, it's like coming home again. Good service, good food, friendly staff. That what made me eat breakfast there every day since 2000.
Thanks for cleaning up the place.</Text>

I'm giving it a 4 cause I love the $8 menu I'm on budget and it's hard to do breakfast at home in the morning. However they don't do well with call in orders so I have to come order and I end up late for work. The one waitress with extreme eye shadow is always super nice and pacifys the situation and always has a story to tell!</Text>

I hadn't eaten in a Denny's in 10 years and was surprised that the food actually was pretty good. I got some sort of bourbon chicken skillet which was basically french fries and some peppers with sweet Szechuan sauce served on a hot Skillet under a couple of chicken breasts. Very not upscale but tasty and I wasn't real picky arriving in town close to midnight after a long day on the road.

The restaurant ambience was non-existent as you would expect of a Denny's, though the staffers were acceptable and quite busy with a large crowd. They were polite even as they had to throw some trashy woman out for smoking pot in the bathroom.

Parking lot looks a little sketchy when you leave, dark in a corner and I couldn't tell if the woman out front was a prostitute or a panhandler or both... But she seemed harmless and didn't bother me once I walked by.< /text>

<Text>The waitress wasn't personable at all. She couldn't answer questions about either of our orders.
Then I let her know that I was taking my daughter to the bathroom,  but the manager cleaned our table while we were gone! They replaced our food but didn't seem very apologetic. The manager (I'm assuming hes the manager) acted like it was such an inconvenience to replace the food that he had just thrown away. Then they didnt even give us a discount for having to wait for our food twice! Terrible service. Will not be back<//Text>< rating>

Well, its good id you want something cheap. The food can be pretty good sometimes, other times its total crap. Usually slow. I have had some really bad service before to the point that I just paid and left because I didnt want to deal with it. But, I have had a few good waiters there.</review>

It's Denny's.  If you need food and its late they are fine.  This location has been her a looooong time and still feels like the "old diner" and the staff have been fine the few times I have been in.<//Review>

I hadn't eaten in a Denny's in 10 years and was surprised that the food actually was pretty good. I got some sort of bourbon chicken skillet which was basically french fries and some peppers with sweet Szechuan sauce served on a hot Skillet under a couple of chicken breasts. Very not upscale but tasty and I wasn't real picky arriving in town close to midnight after a long day on the road.

The restaurant ambience was non-existent as you would expect of a Denny's, though the staffers were acceptable and quite busy with a large crowd. They were polite even as they had to throw some trashy woman out for smoking pot in the bathroom.

Parking lot looks a little sketchy when you leave, dark in a corner and I couldn't tell if the woman out front was a prostitute or a panhandler or both... But she seemed harmless and didn't bother me once I walked by.<//text>

It is Denny's. I was there pretty late, so I was happy it was open. That being said, it was a pretty poor experiance. The server took a really long time to come by, and when she did she said that the cook is really slow so dont expect food anytime soon. When the food finally came it was not bad. But then the server went MIA for a long period of time, to the amount of time that I had to go and find someone to have them get my bill.

But like I said. It is Dennys<//review>

<Text>The food was okay but the servers were more interested in their little personal things that we're going on than anything from that ordering to the waiting for the food to even paying... So just engaged I even had to ask for my credit card back after she said thank walking away has she talked to other servers and the customers that she knew who weren't really buying anything<//Text>< Pictures>

This place is always on fire with their service -- staff is always really friendly, attentive, and prepares your food exactly how you want it in a timely fashion. This is my favorite Denny's.< /Review>

Some of the waiters are good, some are rude and impatient. Depends on who you get. Food was good, that's what's making this rating get 2 stars. Big pile of barf in the parking lot. That was just great. Wouldn't recommend it.</Text>

If I could give 0 stars I would, they never got my order right, after returning the food 3 times,  what I settled on was so overly salty I left hungry, there milkshake machine was broken, I've never paid $30  to eat somewhere and still be hungry when I leave</Review>

<text>The cook got our order wrong tonight. We sat right next to the kitchen and saw our waiter politely request the correct order twice. From our table we could see the cook completly ignore the poor guy. Two or three times our waiter requested our food but after an hour of waiting we told him not to bother. We asked to speak to the manager but apparently this "cook" is the manager...? We left hungry and feeling bad for our waiter. We definitely wont be back for late-night snacks...or anything else...<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

If you value anything in life. Do not eat here.
The service is horrible. My order was wrong though I asked them to confirm it twice over the phone, then the staff told me I was wrong upon arrival...that I didn't ask them to substitute my regular pancakes with strawberry pancakes. So they overcharged me and didn't make any attempts to correct it. They said the order would be ready in 15mins after I place it...got there just shy of 30mins later and it still wasn't ready. The staff agured right in from of us over these strawberry pancakes because strawberries are no longer in season that they stop ordering after November. *one staff member thought we should know (bless her heart) the other didn't think it made a difference if they just sprinkled their strawberry dessert over the pancakes.
The place is dirty.
The pancakes are chewy.
Nothing was hot/warm, but maybe that was my fault.🤷🏽‍♀️😒 #neveragain</Text>
