For the first time I wanted for my car to be service.  Went down the street to eat lunch, returned and my car was done and washed.  Doesn't get any better.  Love this place.</Text>

<review>Chris Ringler made my car buying experience a joy!  Every other time I bought a car I felt bullied and taken advantage of.  I love the fact that I never felt pressured to buy a car. Chris was very patient and answered all my questions. It is so hard to express my gratitude in a review. Northwood Chevrolet and Chris are awesome!<//review>< pictures>

Sorry that others have not had the type of experience that my wife and I had on 1/26/20.  I had decided to purchase a 2020 Hyundai Sonata Limited and the exterior and interior colors were not available within 200 miles of where we live.  I went on Hyundai's vehicle search and Northwood Hyundai/Chevy had the exact vehicle.

I contacted Liz Bagnell, Sales Consultant and she confirmed the vehicle, sent pictures and negotiated a fair price.  Some dealers in my area were asking for MSRP or higher due to first model year and availability.  NOT!   Once we agreed on the (out the door) price, then I had to convince my wife of making a 610-mile, 11-hour (roundtrip) drive to Eureka.  Liz was helpful in the process here too.  We rented a vehicle one way for the drive and were able to see the beautiful western shoreline, (through fog and sunshine).

We had requested that by the time we arrive we would be exhausted and that we wanted to truly get there and (sign and drive).  Liz and the staff at Northwood Chevy get 5 Stars just for that.  Most auto closings seem to take a lifetime.  As a 60+ family man, I have purchased numerous cars.  The time spent purchasing this one was painless and record breaking.

Another service that I have never experienced was the details and time Liz spent with us going over the features and operation of the vehicle.  Sure, most dealers give you an overview, but I have never had a sales rep sit in the passenger side and go through a checklist of the major components on vehicle operation.  Let's face it, once you've signed, it’s on to the next client.  Liz as well as the Sales Manager were concise, professional and made this the best auto purchase we've ever made.

I am a small business owner, and I know we're not always on our A game.  However, the Northwood team was.  You always hear of the poor service, etc.  I wanted to give credit for a job well done.

While I scratched my head knowing I wanted this vehicle enough to drive 600+ miles to purchase it, Northwood Hyundai confirmed that it was worth it.  We'd do it again!</Review>

<text>Our 2019 Corvette Grand Sport developed a "secret sound" after about 8400 miles. This seemed to be emitted from the area of the forward portion of the torque tube. Brent coordinated and Vic performed about twenty hours of labor diagnosing and replacing the torque tube assembly, not a simple task. My experience with Northwood Chevy maintenance was that they were concerned, knowledgeable and efficient. Hopefully this fix will prove long lasting, time will tell, but I felt the dealership was quite responsive.<//text>< Pictures>

I have come in many times to do my car shopping and everyone here is the best.  Knowledgeable on the vehicles and easy to work with.  We bought a Chevy Volt last year, they worked with us to get a good rate and a payment we were comfortable with.  The service Department always takes great care of us as well. They looked over our older suburban before leaving for a trip to Spokane and fixed our AC very last minute.  Couldn't as for a better Dealership to deal with.< /review>

My first visit was covered by warranty so it didn't cost me a dime and I got a car wash. Another visit wasn't covered by the warranty and cost me a few hundred dollars for what seemed like a small part and which they finished installing in about an hour but I still got a free car wash.

<Rate>1< /Rate><user>113624715496340222108<//user><review>I went car shopping on a Saturday with my infant son n sister. I was determined to buy a car that day and thus I came prepared with the finances and the knowledge of what I wanted to test drive and the information on said car. First off, when I got to the dealership no one was around, took someone forever to finally come out and speak with us. Secondly, I was met with the most arrogant guy at Northwood Chevrolet whom just made our experience unpleasant. Not very knowledgeable about the car I was interested in and despite me having cash in hand, no one there seemed to be very motivated to make a sale. I felt as though they had a prejudice towards a single woman with an infant, whom had the knowledge and money to make a sound choice without being taken for a ride, no pun intended. The car I was considering at their lot had 41+ thousand miles in ONE year on it and it was a concern to me, something the arrogant sales guy kept trying to play down like it wasn't a big deal. It had been a rental car before, it was definitely something to be concerned about. They were unwilling to work with me on the price and honestly, I was unwilling to work with them on the price they quoted me, more so based on their poor attitude, then the car. They play superiority games there that someone with a psychology background,  aka me, can clearly see right through. I wouldn't recommend this place. In the end they lost out on a 20+ thousand dollar sale based on poor attitude. I went ahead and purchased a great car at Mid City World Toyota and the guys there were the complete opposite, kind, positive, welcoming, good sports and very helpful. Save yourselves the trouble of dealing with unprofessionals whom clearly lack the motivation to make a sure sale and visit Mid City World. In the end, I went home with a great car, with very little mileage, for my son and I. :)</review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I woild give 0 stars if possible. The parts department is closed and no one at the dealership can check to see if they have a chevrolet rim in stock. I dont need it installed, i just need the rim. Very unhelpful and incompetent staff. Will never shop with them again.<//review>

This place sucks.  They said quote “ I dont care about your problem” referring to a new warrenty truck.  Never buy from this place.  Redding will be a better choice.</review>

<Review>I needed a sensor replaced on one of my tires. The guy made it a point to tell me that if one sensor is out, the rest will usually go shortly after.  I proceeded to tell him that I just needed one sensor replaced. He then got his device to check the sensors on my tires and agreed that only one sensor needed replacing. When we got back inside he told me that the price would be “80 something dollars”, I explain to him that someone had already confirmed that the price would be $65.00.  He then said that he could wave the portion of the cost and just charge me $65.00. I waited approximately 45 minutes and then they told me that they replace the sensor but it would not allow them to turn off my sensor light because something else needed to be done all of a sudden.  They should have told me exactly what was wrong with the sensor if they needed to add anything else in order to fix my vehicle but now they seen what was wrong they replace the sensor charged me $65 and did not even fix turn off the light, this was the main reason why I came.   If they would have told me that they needed to do additional things to fix my sensor BEFORE they decided to replace anything! on my car, I wouldn’t have NOT let them replace anything.  I would not recommend this American Tire to anyone because it seems very shady.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

The worst customer service experience I've ever had at any tire facility. Not even approached by any of the, multitude, off employees working the shift this evening and even management made eye contact just to simply walk off to other things. Absolutely no customer service. Not recommended, Les Schwab Tire across the street, much better!!< /Review>

I was searching for a set of tires and it was helpful to get an idea of the cost out the door. If you see a different price online, I suggest doing a screenshot to be certain that's what you're getting in store. I paid more than I expected but I needed a set badly and they were able to get me in the same day. Took them about 45 minutes which I feel is pretty good. They're practicing COVID protocol and customer service was pretty good.<//Review>

Thank you America’s tire. I had a set of tires mounted by their competitor (not worth mentioning!). When I left my computer kept telling me my tires were not inflated right and all’s they kept telling was it was my truck. I insisted it was the sensor. They would do nothing!!! I took it to America’s tire and Joe Rhodes (I think his name is) told me it was a sensor. Changed it and DONE!!! Thanks to the guys at America’s tire. One and done!! I appreciate your help and quick response.</text>

This place was great. I came in to get a flat fixed, ended up purchasing 5 new tires. Even after I realized I bought the wrong size, they offered to do a test for for me before finalizing the purchase.< /Review>

<review>The gem here is the Green Olive grill that resides within this liquor store.  It serves up great middle eastern kabob plates to go.  I tend to order the kofta kebobs (skewers of very lean and nicely seasoned ground beef) while my wife goes for the samon kebobs.  Plates are $12-$16.</review>< pics>

< Review>
This place is a gem! Clean, friendly service and they have a broad selection of products. The new deli has great food and desserts. The 4.99 half chicken plate with rice, hummus, pita and veggies is amazing and so reasonably priced. The chicken kabob is a very generous portion, cooked and seasoned to perfection. They cook to order so its fresh off the grill.< /Review>

They also charge you extra if you're going to pay with your card; no matter how much you spend.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Very clean, quick service, and unbeatable lunch special - $4.99 for half a chicken and rice + hummus, a BIG pita, and pickled veggies - watch out the chili peppers can be 🔥!</Text>

Bought a 20 oz bottle of Diet Dr Pepper.  First there was no price in the cooler for this drink.  I go to the counter and the guy is very busy watching his mobile phone.  20 seconds later he moves the 6 feet to the register.  Rings it up and says $2.25.  Oddly enough the register that I see says $2.05.  He prints out a receipt that shows $2.25.  Poor service, rip off prices, won’t return.< /Text>

Kinda dirty inside all they do is sweep, never applies water so there's random blood stains and stickiness on the floor.t offers many activities such as Tae Kwon Do, $20.00 USD each month which is a great price, 5 star. Staff is also extremely helpful and not lazy.</Text>

<Review>The best Filipino restaurant in the San Fernando Valley. I'm so happy I found this place; as there are no decent Filipino restaurants nearby. They serve fresh made-to-order pork lumpia's and are relatively inexpensive! The restaurant is definitely a must try if you're looking for a different type of cuisine. Parking is tight, but be patient and you will find one. The employees here do have a hard time communicating, but they are able to understand enough for you to order. A definite must-try!< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIHivYuasB_1bfQuju1rpi5DpaOghZpQtjxagu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-SLoRTuI0lhYaWkzjsbcp--PPWQluspqdjNpK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqIZDfbzpquDxhnhHSQlUyEyYlpXSvHU3jjc1R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIJcRjcQBY4a0wTNDpcQrCog_E8AThQ0degANB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>{'time': 1575642810406, 'text': 'Hello Noesh!

Total cluster. Preordered food for Christmas holiday. Over two hours to get our food at the designated pick up time. They gave some of our order away to another group. We didn't get all the food that we ordered since we had to accept substitutions. Finally gave up and took a credit for the remaining item</text>

I felt bad for just rating 2 stars, but it really wasn't all that great. I only tried one dish, which I don't think I'm willing to go back to try anything else, I'll stick to my usual Filipino food spots better. This one I tried because it was on my way home from work<//Review>

<review>The open kitchen atmosphere gives the confidence that food are handled right. The variety of food selection is superb. A true Pilipino and Tagalog variety, the portions are gourmet and gourmand at the same time. The combo presentarions are easy on the pocket. Good thing, they cater too. The grill section is awesome, INIHAW...or the way we say it ANYHOW...</review><gmapID>0x80c29b1fad25e889:0x3d7800de410ae8< /gmapID><rating>5<//rating>< response>

<time>1509614630826<//time><Text>Most of the Filipino restaurants located in the San Fernando Valley are in Panorama City or North Hills. Im glad there is now one in Northridge.

I visited this place shortly after they opened for business. I found that the food here is good. They are very generous with their portions and the prices are comparable to other Filipino fast food restaurants.

The restaurant is a little small inside but they do utilize the restaurant nextdoor`s dining area for customers during lunch. .< /Text></record>

This is the pride of our Filipino food in the valley. The best craving you will ever satisfy for fast food super sarap i.e. Stupendous food, will highly recommend to all who are looking for superb food in town. Check out there freshly cooked main entrees down to the dessert. Their ginatan bilo bilo is delicious and breakfast served until 11am e.g. Tapsilog, longsilog, bangsilog, jepsilog is a must to try. We went there passed the breakfast hours the owner was so kind to cook fresh eggs to go with our bangsilog and jepsilog. Their customer service is not only very courteous, very polite and friendly group of staff. It's a must to try this restaurant. I will definitely go back and thinking of going for catering service. Excellent job Kuya! Keep up the above and beyond delish food ! Awesome!</text>

(Translated by Google) I like the sisig bangus po, but it's too much ONION, it's mostly fat but it's good. I'm just bored with the taste.
God bless you, just my opinion. I'll be back soon, but hopefully p.o. reduce The onion to lean and fat in the milk. 😊

I like the sisig bangus po, pero tooo much ONION, dinuguan karamihan po mataba pero masarap naman po.  Biko ko lang po sa lasa.
God bless you po, opinion ko lang naman po. Babalik parin naman ako,pero sana p.o. mabawasan Ang onion sa sisig and taba sa dinuguan. 😊</text>

<review>We ordered the strawberry cake, the red velvet cake, the chocolate ganache, and a dozen assorted cupcakes. My guests complimented them endlessly both for their beauty and for being amazingly delicious. What a win!

Amazing customer service and even better baked goods! They were polite and accommodating and went above my expectations. The carrot cake was one of the most delicious cakes I’ve ever had! I will definitely be going back to them from now on for my baking needs.< /text>

<review>I wasn't impressed, nothing for the office more for individuals only...guess im used to fresh, warm moist cupcakes....call me crazy but it just wasn't what I expected from the reviews....maybe I caught them on a bad day, but there was only one small area to choose from....presentation was great, freshness was okay.</review>< Pics>

If you can't satisfy your sweet tooth here it is your own fault!  The Lemon Meringue Pie, the Creme Brûlée and Vanilla Cupcake are pretty killer!  I must confess I haven't fully explored the menu yet but I plan to!!!< /Text>

Just wow. I was turned on to this place a while back (almost 10 years ago) from my friend. It was still a hidden gem I believe at that point. I have been across the country for several years, but still I have continued to follow them through social media and continue to admire from afar and watch them grow in popularity and so as soon as I was back in the valley I had to go. I was so pleased today I finally got to try their sandwiches and I will say it was phenomenal. Like one of the best I have ever had, their fresh baked bread is amazing. Their lemon bars and cupcakes were just as delicious as before. Quality control 👍❤. Thanks Chiffonos!</text>

The experience was typical (workers are nice and helpful) but the cupcakes were definitely not the best I’ve had in town. Frosted Cakery and La Boulangerie are much better options. Also, the cheesecake was gritty and not homogeneous in texture.</text>

<review>They have some of the best eclairs I've ever tasted and their Boston cream cupcakes are heavenly.   So far everything I've tasted has been delicious!  I would recommend them to anyone looking for cupcakes or cakes.</review>< Pics>

<rate>2<//rate><review>The atmosphere is very cute and I liked the style of the shopa and the worker was very nice. Unfortunately, the cupcakes and the cobbler just aren't good. They remind me of a walmart cupcake in the way that they are artificially flavored and the icing is just a gritty general buttercream. The cobbler was sloppy and I'm pretty sure just used canned peaches for the fruit. At 3.00 per basic cupcake, they are very lacking in almost every aspect. Overall, cute shop but the goods just don't deliver.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x809442e8d27f9777:0xf969095d27d7e0fb<//GmapID></record>

The raspberry truffle cake is to die for and made a spectacular birthday cake.  As the birthday boy remarked, the cake was the bomb of his party.  Thank you, Chiffonos.</Review>

<review>My guess is that most of the one-star reviews are from people who didn't pay attention to the rules and weren't prepared. The folks here aren't super happy-go-lucky, but it's easy to see why: I was there for about an hour, and I overheard two customers arguing about things when they were clearly in the wrong (didn't have the right paperwork, didn't read the refund policy, etc...). I'm sure they get multiple people every day who try to argue about "well my passport just expired" or "I didn't know I had to bring proof of residency" or "I missed the deadline for pickup" etc...

The staff was very helpful and straightforward with me, and got me in and out in a timely manner. Once they could see I knew the process and wasn't screwing around, we had some friendly conversation.

They are slammed with orders right now, and limited in capacity because of the pandemic. Do your research, come prepared, and don't expect warm fuzzies.<//review>< user_name>

Quite a seamless process, albeit the pandemic influence, still a very well process to flush out panic buyers.. So I am not sure why all the negative reviews.. seems to come from anxious buyers.<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Everyone here is super helpful from Woody to Jax to the entire staff. You must know what you want and be ready to do your research, also be ready with your questions. While making your appointment read the guidelines and follow throw in order for the process to be swift. I honestly had no idea what to do or what to buy since I bought out of panic due to the current situation and 2nd amendment at stake. I made sure I studied for the exam, researched the weapons they advised and I am happy with my purchase. I'm now looking forward to the next purchase with my husband and trying to start the process with him before our rights may be changing. Better to be prepared and not need, than to need and not be prepared.< /text>< userid>

Horrible customer service, rude staff that like to waste your time. Go to Carson Jewelry and Loan 22012 S Avalon Blvd, Carson, CA. They have top notch customer service, Help you to the fullest. Great management, answer all questions you have. I’ve been to this place, Turners etc and I can honestly say Carson jewelry and loan is with out a doubt the best gun shop I’ve been to. They have all positive reviews. No negatives and I can see why.<//review>

< Review>
Don't waste your time unless you are ok with literally wasting hours of time unnecessarily. --- Horrible place. Made an appointment for 3:00pm and arrived only to be told I have to wait another 60-90 minutes, because they were behind.... I wasted 40 minutes driving there and then another 40 minutes driving home.

Sold a gun here prior and they ripped me on off the buying price. Just straight up greedy and unprofessional management.

Ill gladly take my business to another shop that respects people's time and doesn't have a dry and obnoxious attitude about every single thing. Monotones.. dry... unpleasant...</Review>

Don't bother them; they are too busy for you. It took a week for them to call me back. Then I had to place a deposit on a gun I never saw. Then I waited another week to come in to take the FSC test and initiate my background check.

After seven weeks later, I have no Gun, and so far, I am out $37.19 + $25; the state DOJ can not determine if I can own one. The background came back undetermined. Now I get to begin the journey of figuring out why.

I paid the state to make that determination, and after being notified of said inconclusive ruling, I was told I would be refunded my deposit minus the money I paid for my background check.

According to the law, they could have completed the transaction and given me my gun at their discretion. I am in some sort of limbo. I am not happy.

Update: I received my partial refund today. I also called another shop who said they would have released the firearm after the undetermined status. They also said many don't. I will be going through them, and so begins the new month's journey again.</text>

CROOCKS! terrible customer service, very rude and after 2 months back and forth they cancelled my order.

terrible with appointments, each appointment is about 2-3 weeks apart, one of the appointments i went in to do paper for and background check , i was there 15 mins before my appointment after waiting 40 mins i walked in and they said my appointment doesn't not exist in their system and somebody messed up on their side, instead of making another appointment on the spot and apologies since it was their mess up they told me to leave and email to make another appointment so i did 2 appointments back and forth I finally get an appointment to pick up the gun, 30 mins into the appointment they tell me their computer just went down and they cants release the my purchase to me same as before told me to leave and email for another appointment....???? really?  No apologies whatsoever for wasting my time the second time. last appointment they made me I missed, I live about 45 mins away from them. I called multiple times to reschedule but their number is always busy, today i was finally able to reach them and they told me i have been cancelled since i missed my last appointment...lol its a joke. The lady on the phone tells me it cost them money every time they do background check but than she goes and deducts all the background check fees from me plus 75$ restocking fee (it cost me money when do you background check not you)

charged me 3 times for background fee and charged me $75 restocking fee. since I paid in full, never got to see the gun and paid 75 restocking fee? CROOKS!

Find another gun store or prepare for a world of hassle. There are other gun stores in Los Angeles. Seriously, look it up.</review>

I’ve been shopping here for awhile, and the customer service is always great. I’m in the process of buying a rifle, and while the circumstances have slowed thing down, they have been accommodating through emails and phone. Anyone who has been having problems getting in contact with the shop, please realize they are extremely backed up. I was annoyed at how hard it was to get an appointment until I went in for mine. They can only let a certain amount of people in at a time, and you can’t just come in to browse. It sucks, but this is how it is for the time being. I was truly impressed by the professionalism and safety precautions they took when I came in for my appointment.< /text>

This is my third review for peninsula guns and tactical. Every transaction has been smooth and professional. They didn't have either of the products I wanted in stock, but didn't hesitate to order them and give me the best price in the area on both. They also called me immediately when my products arrived as well. This has been and will continue to be my store of choice.</text>

Phenomenal place to purchase a gun for everyone including minorities and LGBTQ+ people. All salespeople were very friendly, knowledgable and respectful. My first time purchasing and my salesperson asked me my pronouns preference, walked me through the gun safety and informed me of every step to be taken. Yes, it took longer than just walking into a gun shop and picking up a gun but that's COVID-19, not the store's fault. I was able to purchase a gun within a week of initial contact, pass the test and now waiting 10 days.< /text>

While this gun shop wouldn't be very good for other parts of the country in "free states" they are very good for what we have in the. Bay Area Good selection of AR15s (pre-scare, shelves are empty now) and Saigas etc, along with a nice selection of pistols. Their ammo is a bit expensive, but same as you would expect from most gun shops.

Tabors used to be close by, but they closed :-(< /review>

<text>Bad customer Service. Bad attitudes. Everyone there is arrogant and rude. No one helped me when I was in the store for two hours said they were to busy. If you want good service on guns with excellent customer service, no wait times better and cheaper guns go to Carson Jewelry and Loan at 22012 S Avalon Blvd, Carson, CA 90745. They really are the best gun shop I’ve ever been to. I will only shop there from now on. I can see why they have all positive reviews.< /text><GmapID>0x80c2ba39523723d5:0x942ca89b76d89b3e</GmapID><userid>105906408325637854306</userid>< pics>

Edit: going on a month and 2 emails. No response yet for an appointment. I went to visit this place, I was met at the door by an older guy, first thing he said was "Do you have an appointment?", I said "I have sent emails requesting for one". No comment, and was not helped. Dropped to one star. I didn't sit and argue with the guy, waste of my time and definitely does not deserve my business. Just said thanks and walked away. Took my business elsewhere. Sad I cant even support my own communities' business. Very disappointed.

Have not even stepped foot in this place. Emailed for an appointment 3 weeks ago or more, no response. I want to buy local, and support. But this spot is not doing me any justice. Have to drive out to another recommended shop that there employees are more on top of there stuff and know how to run their business in these hard times.< /Review>

Horrible service! I have been calling here since yesterday, however I finally got an answer today after hours of back to back calls.... after my call got answered I then got placed on hold for 20 minutes after asking what can I bring in other then an utility bill. Then I explained to the next person my reason for calling. He had the nerves to tell me to call back another time I then explained to him that I have been calling for hours and waited for 20+ minutes on hold. He literally just hung up in my face! Horrible customer service! Very RUDE!< /text>

<Name>Andre< /Name><Text>Thank you Martin B. Retting, this was my first time purchasing a firearm. I was treated with respect and guided into the right direction even though I had a hard time choosing between 2 firearns. Logan was a great salesperson and very informative. I'd give 10 stars if I could.

To those on here complaining about service and having to make an appointment... you live in CALIFORNIA. What did you expect? You thought it's as simple as walking into a store and buying a gun? You voted for this. And now in the midst of a global "pandemic" you get mad because you can't just go pick up your gun? Are you serious? And you blame the staff for being annoyed at all the dumb questions you ask when you didnt even bother to do any research whatsoever? Stop being so entitled. Please get over yourselves.

Martin B Retting have done a great job adapting to the current circumstances, they are a well oiled machine taking all precautions and as long as you are humble, take some responsibility and do a bit of research BEFORE making an appointment, these gentlemen will guide you in the right direction.

Thank you again! Because of my great experience as a first time gun purchaser, you have found yourself a life long, loyal client!

If you ever want your website updated and redesigned, please reach out to me, I would love to work with you guys.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80c2ba39523723d5:0x942ca89b76d89b3e</gmap_id>< Rate>

<review>Best customer service I’ve had in a while! After having a near breakdown coming from Turners (after they gave me the run around wasting 3 hours there for nothing), as soon as I walk into M B Retting, I’m greeted with welcoming, down-to earth, yet hilarious staff. It honestly caught me off guard. The level of professionalism, very cut and dry about the process, staff went over and beyond to help me, were very informative. Not once did they rush me or give off an impatient vibe (even with a full house of people). They took there time with everything, still while acknowledging each new guest entering. The process for first time buyers can be a bit lengthy but these guys will have you crying laughing the entire time. Very positive and clean atmosphere. Even the new guy was awesome-sauce. Great prices for top notch artillery. I’m so happy I found this place. Can’t wait to pick up my FA. This place is a hidden gem, with ample parking. You won’t be disappointed! Would definitely recommend. Will be returning soon!</review>< user>

It doesn't say you need to make appointments on the website, so we drive all the way out just to be told that. Update your website so others don't do this.  Huge waste of time.< /text>

<Review>It’s a bit lacking in customer attention. But once you go looking and asking for help you will get it. I so luv their antique guns and replicas. I’ll be going back a few times for more guns cause of this.  That’s the pistol I put on layaway. Genuine working ww2 pistol. Great buy.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOn5_RE8r-DR19qIgi2VIVRjd-8y1VQMBJGR-xg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEGZCRKkO0Fp90pGl0q1vQ6HnMBzjXIIP5GGG4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>Knowledgeable folks that are polite if you are. Kinda just a way to do things. They will help you out to find what feels right for you personally. It can be intimidating purchasing a first firearm and you want staff that are willing to help you feel comfortable. For skill level.

Walk in the store to buy one gun, ended up in walking out with two amazing guns with the price I had in mind for one gun. Mark who helped me was the most amazing helpful guy in I ever met in any gun shops. He was dedicated to the craft and very knowledgeable in the field and made my experience of buying the best I had in any store. He is the library of guns.</Text>

Mark is THE absolute GOAT. I have never in my life experienced such amazing service by anyone in any field ever. The level of professionalism displayed by this man was beyond anything I ever expected. He took his time to help me and my friend. He didn't rush us, he answered all of our questions to the fullest extent, and he did so with a great attitude and demeanor. I urge anyone who is looking to purchase a firearm or accessories for firearms, or anything even related to firearms to go to this shop and see this man. Trust me you will not be disappointed. Thank you so much Martin B Retting and thank you even more Mr. Mark. You're the best!</text>

I don’t see what all negative reviews are about. I’ve bought 2 guns here and both times I was helped promptly. It’s busy...all the time, but I never waited more than a few minutes before someone was there to help. Yes, some of the sales staff seem arrogant, and the one girl that works there isn’t very friendly, but I’m going to buy a gun- not make friends. These people know their guns and are willing to show and explain to you what you want to know.

The price was right. I paid less for both of my guns here than anywhere else’s advertised prices. The selection was good, especially for handguns. Both visits I got helped quickly, questions answered, and purchases were painless. Once again, I didn’t come to make friends with the staff, I came to purchase a weapon. So I can forgive the less than jovial vibe from a few of the clerks.

Bottom line is this place is legit. It’s got what you need, and that’s what matters...isn’t it?< /text>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>I make it a point to drive here 1st whenever I'm hunting for a special firearm.  They have the best selection of new firearms and their used firearms are world class on almost every visit.  I was looking for a Colt Python and they had 4 in stock; almost any gun shop NEVER has even a single one for sale.

Friendly staff and they realize pretty quickly when you're a gun conisouir and can lead you to something that peaks your interests. The inventory turns over often so you almost never see the same used inventory each time you visit.  Prices are reasonable.  Even their accessories and knife prices are on par with online pricing.  Everyone should visit this place at least once if they are firearms lovers; especially if they are collectors.< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate>< gmap_id>

<Review>This is a pretty great gun shop.
Staff can be less than friendly.

they have a large selection of used firearms and ammunition.
The staff is knowledgeable for the most part and some are pretty helpful, others dont want to give you the time of day.

The place is pretty packed and getting help can some times be tough.  Its best that you go there knowing exactly what you want, otherwise the staff can get frustrated.

Ive purchased several firearms there. The prices are generally a bit higher but they have a great selection.

They also have a great facebook page where you can stay up to date on all the happenings as far as new regulations and sales.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I get it, people can try ones patience, but, you have to give people a chance before you are rude to them. This place has some pretty jaded people working for them. They need to be a little more patient and kind.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Went in here and waited to be helped on for more than 15 min. Busy but saw one worker help someone else, when I asked for help he said he had to put some ammo. Sucks cause I was walking into to make a purchase and the attitude of this worker made me walk away. I understand he was doing Ammo inventory but he spent about 10 min talking to another customer. No wonder locals in the neighborhood recommended me to turners in Torrance.</text>

Sad to say my LGS for many years has such poor service/pricing. I called for a price on a gun and was told they can't give the price over the phone. Their prices are so high they're assamed to give it over the phone. Couple that with the mediocre customer service warrants the 1 star review. I'll never do business here again.<//Text>

I make it a point to drive here 1st whenever I'm hunting for a special firearm.  They have the best selection of new firearms and their used firearms are world class on almost every visit.  I was looking for a Colt Python and they had 4 in stock; almost any gun shop NEVER has even a single one for sale.

Friendly staff and they realize pretty quickly when you're a gun conisouir and can lead you to something that peaks your interests. The inventory turns over often so you almost never see the same used inventory each time you visit.  Prices are reasonable.  Even their accessories and knife prices are on par with online pricing.  Everyone should visit this place at least once if they are firearms lovers; especially if they are collectors.<//Review>

The nicest people I've ever encountered at a gun shop. The guy helping me answered every question I had and even suggested some better ideas. He actually cared about his job. I was really impressed after coming from Turner's in the Valley it was like night and day difference. I will definitely purchase all gun related stuff here even if I have to drive from the valley.< /review>

<Review>The best thing about buying a gun for prevention and safety is these guy's. They answered all my questions nicely, took the time to show my wife and I the best options for our needs and also gave us information on gun safety classes. Huge selection, fast local service, and they also offer after sale service and support - I recommend them, my wife felt comfortable, they also showed my wife how to open the gun, use the safety and how to hold it properly. Next step training. No need to look further.

Awesome after sale service. I called the store to get a 1990 gun purchase record and Bob Retting (earlier it was Ingrid who helped) spent considerable time to extract the details and emailed me the information I needed.  Will definitely continue buying here for the great customer service.<//Text>

So legit! This store rocks. Best gun store since I last went to Arizona. They so much customer service, so many guns and items. The best store around by far. I walked in and got every question answered. They had exactly what I wanted and I went home, thought about it and placed the order over the phone! Talk about convenient! They have thousands of guns, a selection of complete and stripped lowers as well as uppers for ar 15s. I highly recommend this place.</Text>

<text>I love this place. The workers here have always been nice to me and take the time to inform me of the different weapons I have been interested in from spray to my firearms. Been here a few times and it's a good experience every time. Only kicker is you have to be patient because the workers are usually really busy helping other customers. But when it's your turn, they dedicate themselves to you and answer all your questions.< /text>< Pictures>

I bought a .38. The quality of the weapon was good. The service not so much. The customer service reps spent damn bear an hour trying to sell customers who didn't buy anything, while I waited to purchase a weapon I already knew I wanted and was going to buy. I damn near left the store in disgust and went elsewhere .<//review>

<Text>Nice store, and great selection, but the Customer Service guys need to lose the arrogant attitude that they know everything there is to know about guns and ammo.
Hey, That's great that you are knowledgeable, because that's why you are there, but learn to be a little more humble, and try not and belittle your customers ,when they ask questions or have opinions.< /Text>< Pics>

I have been a shooter for several years.  Martin B Retting has the  best selection of firearms in LA county in my opinion. When you speak to a firearm specialist you are getting a true education . Every specialist is extremely knowledgeable and if they by happen not to know the answer, someone does.</Text>

<Review>I only ventured to this shop to do a PPT. And I will definitely avoid in the future. The customer service was not great and the store is extremely cramped. I have the shop 3 stars for simply how cool it is to see all the firearms and history. I would not recommend this store to other though.< /Review>< Rate>

I love it here! People need to understand that this is a GUN STORE, they're not selling candy canes. Its a serious business, and this state doesn't make it any easier. I went in as a novice, waited my turn, and a gentlemen spent 2 HOURS narrowing down my pistol search to a Colt 45 ACP Government Model. I've since purchased SEVERAL firearms, and even had AR Transferred to me through the store. They are good people, and very knowledgeable.< /review>

<review>Andy was awesome through the whole process of purchasing a gun, from the many questions I had about use and comfort to what was appropriate for me. I was anxious and Andy was so comforting to me. If you are nervous about purchasing a weapon, or just have questions, ask for Andy! Will definitely recommend to my co-workers and friends because of him. John D< /review>< Name>

<text>Store owner lost my new gun order and did not admit it for a week.

Poor customer service.  They have no number system for the next customer waiting.
Typical culver city preference given to the person with "right/white " complextion.

Would advise to stay away.  Find another place that respects your hard earned money and time.< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

< Review>
BEST EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD IN A GUN PURCHASE!!!  This was my 3rd gun purchase and BY FAR my most enjoyable.  Mark helped me out and was extremely helpful, personable, and professional.  The selection was immaculate, and the service was impecable.  A friend of mine joined me for the trip, and was sold on the experience as well.  He says his next purchase will be from Martin B. Retting Inc, and mine will be as well!!  5 Star Rating!!!!!  Do yourself a favor and ASK FOR MARK!  He was AWESOME!!!!< /Review>

I've read a few reviews about the workers here being racist or arrogant; quite frankly, I can't see it.

Walked in on a Saturday morning with Mom, Dad, Grandma and my younger brother. Nothing spells out Mexican family like bring abuelita along for the ride; however, Cesar helped me out and was helpful, professional, and willing to answer any questions I had. Ended up placing an order for a Henry Repeater Carbine.

As far as the order goes, I got a call that I wasn't able to answer and I was left a voicemail message advising that my firearm was at the shop. Direct and no non-sense.

While it does take a minute to get some help, it's not a huge deal. The staff is professional and willing to let you get a hold of just about any weapon as long as you're respectful and show a bit of "gun sense".

Overall, I hope to continue purchasing from this establishment .

Thanks!< /Text>

After having a bad experience with Ammo Bros and having to wait 6hrs to be helped. In addition, the staff were very unprofessional, they argued amongs each other, and they had 4 other staff members doing nothing. When they would been easily capable of helping those with questions or purchasing a firearm. Their common sense begin kicking in about 12am when DOJ was closed and had to be placed on a express line. Anyhow, I gave up and found this place in Culver City. I gave it a shot, waited for about 1hr 30 min. to be helped, not so bad.

The people here were very funny, friendly and understanding. Very organized, fast and efficient with every customer. Aside from their crazy amount of handgun collection to choose from, their prices were fair.

Not sure i remember the guys name that helped me: bald, tall, heavy set guy. But he was amazing, patient, very cool in terms of following up with the customers waiting in line, every 8 minutes he was going back and forth.

Guys and girls, give this shop a chance.< /Text>

<Text>A busy little store with a variety of firearms - including a nice array of older, rarer guns.
They are pretty busy and getting the attention of a salesman is sometimes difficult.  Having said that - they are pretty knowledgeable, and happy to help once you've got their attention.
Prices didn't seem bad.
They have a great range of Kimber 1911s.<//Text></record>

I needed some bullets. They sold me some bullets. This took about 5 minutes. If you've experienced the joy of some other ammunition retailers, you'll understand how great that is. Friendly staff, decent (for California...) selection of products, and it's so cramped inside you'll probably make a few friends.< /review>

I've read several negative reviews about this place, but I've got to say that has not been my experience here.  Typically, most gun shops do not like to deal with people that do a private party transfers. This is because there's not too much money in it for the shop.  While I have made a couple of gun purchases here, most of my transactions have been private party transfers, ammo, accessories etc.  The staff has always been cordial and friendly.

The only thing that keeps me from giving them five stars is you can go in there and wait up to an hour or more before you get any help, and several times I have seen people that came into the shop after me get served before me.  They really need one of those machines where a person can take a number so that they can be served in the order in which they come in. At the very least, a sign in sheet would work just as well, if not better so that people can be called by name.<//review>

Can't go five stars because the prices are high, as previously reported by other reviews, I concur. The high price is offset if you live nearby like we do. To really save a lot over their prices one would have to go to Arizona. And weekends like that are expensive and offsets the savings. So I will have to admit I gave it higher marks and paid the higher prices because it is convenient.

This is Saturday, and we went to the store at 9:38 AM, minutes after opening, and there was small crowd.

I found that they had in stock the guns I wanted, and the store filled with more customers than could be helped by the time we were taking our handgun safety tests. I learned today those tests are only good for five years. Every five years you have to do it over again. So the wife and I both had to take the tests. The store became so busy, Susan went back out to the car to use her phone while she waited. The young salesman named "Blue" stuck with my process first, and gave me a heads up when it was time to call the wife back into the store, and grade her test, sell her the gun, and fill out paperwork.

The paperwork is going to be the same wherever you go in California, so I give this store a higher mark because of the diligence Blue attended to satisfying us as customers. We bought 3 pistols and a high powered rifle and the process took hours. The crush of people subsided by the time we finished buying bullets and guns.

It was 1:06 PM when I walked out the door with a big box of ammo, 9mm, 500mag, 30-06, and .22 LR, and receipts for the guns. One of the pistols I will have to wait a month for because in California you're not allowed to by more than one pistol at a time. One for me, one for the wife, and a used lady's 38 Smith on lay-away.</text>

AVOID!

Absolutely avoid Martin B Retting. I've had horrible experiences there and vowed never to go back. Their staff is terrible and extremely rude. Why are all of them so condescending? Is my money not green? If they worked in any other business, they'd be fired. Just because they wear a gun at work they think think they're gods?

I'm not the only person who has had this experience and numerous other Yelp reviews also complain about the salesmen who are hostile, disrespectful and arrogant to the customers.

A lot of the salesmen are very bigoted as well.  One of my friends is black and and another is Hispanic -- both are respectively police officers for LA County Sheriffs and Culver City PD by the way -- and while off duty they got the ultra-rude treatment by the boys of Retting.  The salesmen waited on all the white guys first before arrogantly assuming my buddies were gang members and almost telling them to get out of the store.  If you're a woman interested in guns, forget about it.  You won't get any help at all.  I assume the people writing the glowing reviews of the store fit the same age and ethnic demographic as the salesmen who work there.

The rent at that place must be pretty high too, because everything is horribly overpriced.  I've found WAY better deals at other brick and mortar stores or on the internet.

Yeah, it's hard to find a good gun store in LA but that doesn't mean we should settle for a place as horrible as Retting.

I have been involved with the shooting sports for about 25 years too and am not new to this field.  I own about 7 guns right now and have owned more in the past.

Bottom Line: Don't go to Martin Retting.  Find another store.< /text>

< review>
The reason I opened up this account was to write this review which will be brutal, but if they can't take it, then selling arms isn't as tough as a biz as I thought.

This place really takes you for a ride.  It is always crowded only because it's the only place in LA area with the exception of many places in The Valley and Turner's Outdoorsman in Manhattan Beach.  I have bought a few firearms in the past 5 years, and every time I have gone into Martin B Retting, the service is horrific.  Not only do they treat their customers like they are stupid when they have an issue with their purchase, but they treat prospective customers like they're stupid as well.  I've only gone there to hold guns in my hand so I can buy it somewhere else after my first few experience there.

I was with m wife, and we were looking for a handgun for her. We specified that we wanted a piece with a safety switch, not a grip safety.  He looked at us like we were fools, and proceeded to pull out a Springfield Armory gun to show how it wouldn't go off if somebody were to grab it with one finger.  Thanks for the advice, bud, but you just look like a prick.  We were turned off buy the way he spoke to us the whole time as well.  We left without making a purchase.  I came back again, figuring I wouldn't get another prick helping me out, but my experience was virtually the same, but I found a good handgun for her and got it at Turner's.

In addition to the attitude these guys give because they're the only game in town within 45 minutes...get a damn number system!  The salespeople feel like helping whoever they want based on what the person looks like, i.e., are they wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat on or a t-shirt with a huge eagle and American flag or not.  It's really ridiculous that a customer has to fight to speak to somebody so they can hand over $700. They do love to sell to African-Americans though...they're all over the guys, and damn, when they come in with their girls these guys really know how to sell them.

Bottom line, if they want to sell, they should just just be nice.  I was willing to make the 45 min trip to buy at another spot after my treatment there.

Beyond all the other stuff, this place has a small selection of American products.  Yeah, I know that Germans and Austrians are huge producers and some of them have factories in the US, but I've never even seen a Beretta on the handgun shelf.  Yeah, I know, Beretta is Italian, and I mentioned Springfield Armory earlier, but these guys really love their German and Austrian products...more than most gun stores.  I think the reason is because of the ancestry of the owner.  Retting is possibly a British or Scottish name, but most-likely German or Dutch per my research, which I did with a fine tooth comb before making this comment.  There's a reason there is a nice section of Nazi memorabilia here.  I am not opposed to stores selling Nazi items, but they generally are accompanied by information like who took it off a Nazi and where, or a letter dating back to WW2.  There's nothing of the sort here...just here's Nazi stuff with a date and description of the item.  Seems like they have an affinity for the Nazi era.</review>

I assume the people writing the glowing reviews of the store fit the same age and ethnic demographic as the salesmen who work there.

The rent at that place must be pretty high too, because everything is horribly overpriced.  I've found WAY better deals at other brick and mortar stores or on the internet.

Yeah, it's hard to find a good gun store in LA but that doesn't mean we should settle for a place as horrible as Retting.

I have been involved with the shooting sports for about 25 years too and am not new to this field.  I own about 7 guns right now and have owned more in the past.

Bottom Line: Don't go to Martin Retting.  Find another store.< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>It's a gun store, not a Starbucks.  If you go to Starbucks and want to "just look around," the staff will still ask you if you want a coffee or whatever.  If you go to this well-stocked, serious gunstore, the staff expects that you are either shopping for a weapon or need assistance for a weapon that is malfunctioning, or some other gun-related matter.  If you want to go to a museum, go to a museum....

My point is this: the shop is incredibly well-furnished, with enormous selection and a  knowledgeable staff.  If they are serious, it is because this is a serious business.  If they are not all smiles and laughs, like the kids serving you the latte at Starbucks, its because latte never killed anybody, so anybody can buy one, whereas guns are dangerous and serious items, and the people who sell and service them know that.

So, the complaints about the shop staff being rude is just bull -- they are serious, and should be.

If you want great selection, well-trained staff and good advice, go to MBR.  If you want to laugh and pass an hour congenially, go to Starbucks.<//review>< pics>

I went in there with the intention of buying a handgun. After a while of waiting at the counter, I asked a guy who looked like he might work there for help.
He acted like he was doing me a favor to dismissively say they didn’t have the one I was interested in stock. No offer of when they might stock it, or offers to show me any similar models.
Then he goes on some 2nd amendment  rights rant. Kinda the wrong audience as I was in a gun shop to buy a gun.
But several of the other guys hanging around chimed in, it was like unsolicited opinion hour.
The lonliest guy in the place had to be the fellow at the cash register, as no one was doing any buying there, they just seemed to be hanging around to BS, and look cool.
I’ll never go there again as they are the antithesis of what I expect a firearms store to be.<//Text>

Can't go five stars because the prices are high, as previously reported by other reviews, I concur. The high price is offset if you live nearby like we do. To really save a lot over their prices one would have to go to Arizona. And weekends like that are expensive and offsets the savings. So I will have to admit I gave it higher marks and paid the higher prices because it is convenient.

This is Saturday, and we went to the store at 9:38 AM, minutes after opening, and there was small crowd.

I found that they had in stock the guns I wanted, and the store filled with more customers than could be helped by the time we were taking our handgun safety tests. I learned today those tests are only good for five years. Every five years you have to do it over again. So the wife and I both had to take the tests. The store became so busy, Susan went back out to the car to use her phone while she waited. The young salesman named "Blue" stuck with my process first, and gave me a heads up when it was time to call the wife back into the store, and grade her test, sell her the gun, and fill out paperwork.

The paperwork is going to be the same wherever you go in California, so I give this store a higher mark because of the diligence Blue attended to satisfying us as customers. We bought 3 pistols and a high powered rifle and the process took hours. The crush of people subsided by the time we finished buying bullets and guns.

It was 1:06 PM when I walked out the door with a big box of ammo, 9mm, 500mag, 30-06, and .22 LR, and receipts for the guns. One of the pistols I will have to wait a month for because in California you're not allowed to by more than one pistol at a time. One for me, one for the wife, and a used lady's 38 Smith on lay-away.< /review>

Based on my experience there today I am going to stop shopping here.  Hopefully they get enough negative comments on their rude service and change.   Will check back in ten years.  Too many online options than to put up with this.

Randy was awesome.

What I can get there for $470.00 Ammo Brothers sells for $310.00.  Prices are as insulting as the workers.<//text>

This is the worst gun shop I have ever been to. If you want to be ripped off, go here. If you want to get BS on your trade, go here. If you want to be treated like garbage by the OWNER go here. The owner is another word for a DONKEY. The guns are all $200-$300 over priced and if you go there for a trade in the owner will give you nothing in comparison to the actual guns worth. AVOID< /Text>

<Review>This place rips you off. You  can get a lot of their inventory at different stores like turners or the target range in van nuys for the actual msrp of the product. and dont sell your guns to them cuz they will give you almost nothing for it and then sell it for its actual retail price. Their employees also have no social intelligence and condescend to their customers.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

What a great experience. I showed up promptly when they opened and there was an initial rush of people, but then again it's LA so that's to be expected. I really liked the vibe of the staff and the friendly environment they created. I currently own a shotgun and was there to buy a Glock 17 9mm handgun. I waited for a sale to finalize which took about 10 minutes, but I just had fun looking around at the toys so there wasn't a bored or annoying period.

Peggy helped me all the way through the Handgun Safety Certificate and the process took about 15 minutes tops. Peggy was so cool and personable we just talked and laughed through the registration and deposit process. While she was filling out paperwork, another store employee Eddie struck a neat conversation about Glocks and why he hated them and swears by them now.

Really all in all a great place. Really felt like I was back in any Ohio gunshop. People who all have a common interest and we don't have to feel ashamed with all the anti-gun opinions in Solcal. Thank you guys so much again and head down to Martin B Retting if you want great service (which in my opinion is in the price tag).</review>

So I got my first Handgun from here a year ago and have been looking for a pre owned Glock 19 Gen 3. I sent them an email on facebook and they responded within minutes. They had one and were about to put it out, they offered to hold it for me without a penny down. I went in the next day and saw my name on the box. I am waiting to pick my 1st Glock in 8 days. These guys are very knowledgeable and ever willing to teach, share info and answer all Ur qtns.< /review>

<Review>I've been dealing with MBR since the '60s.  It's one of the few constants in my life.  First, they are an exceptionally well stocked, large gunstore.  They're also usually fairly busy. I am old enough to remember when you could go & just hang out at the local gun store.  Those days are long gone, esp. in LA, since most of the gunstores are also long gone (Pony Express, B&B, et al).  I have experienced brusk attitudes when all I wanted to do was wax nostalgic about old times, probably because they could see paying customers over my shoulder.  As other reviewers have stated, the experience varies.  Today I called (helping a neighbor get into shooting), & got Mark (well thought of in another review here). He gave me the best prices on my neighbor's choice of handguns of any of the 7 places I called, & has a used one in stock at a substantial savings, AND is holding it for us thru tomorrow.  I candidly pointed out to him the mixed reviews & his excellent one, & he told me that many of the oldtimers are no longer with the store, so all I can say is that any snapshot in time can color your feelings toward a specific store, but my 50 year association with the store has been positive.  In addition to the lowest price on the new gun, the used gun price is $100 less, & they'll do my neighbor's HSC for $15 vs. the $25 others quoted.  I'll post more after our experience tomorrow, but I'd suggest giving MBR another chance.<//Review>< pics>

One of them completely ignored me, and the other decided to help a white couple who had walked in while I was already in line waiting to purchase a rifle. Save yourself the time and go somewhere else where they would at least treat their customers with respect.</text><gmap_id>0x80c2ba39523723d5:0x942ca89b76d89b3e</gmap_id>< user_name>

<review>The chicken in the photo is "shawarma". Yikes. The only redeeming quality about the "pita" is that it was warm. Hummus was decent at best. At least the salad was good, but it was the best part of the meal.< /review>< pics>

An excellent Lebanese restaurant, taking greatest care to serve authentic, delicious dishes. All grilling is on charcoal, and you can taste the difference. Be sure to try the baklava -- it's made fresh, and isn't super-sweet.<//review>

Love this Mom & Pop restaurant. The owner and his wife are very nice and treat you like family. The food is great and well priced. Seems like no matter what you order, they give you a lot of it!! The free Naan bread is great with the homemade humus that comes before every meal. Definitely will good back.< /text>

<Text>Kobobgee Grill made my taste buds dance! I stuck with the Mezzas …hummus, muhamarah, and warak inab (stuffed grape leaves).  I’m still salivating while writing this review. This is seriously great food. Most people think they’ve eaten hummus. Grocery store hummus bears little resemblance to the real thing. Kabobgee’s hummus is smooth and rich and plate-lickable. Happily it and the muhamarah (really where has this been all my life!)  is served with minutes old pita. OMG the pita, fresh, hot, thin, with a crisp crust.  Back to the muhamarah, most people have never tasted this sweet, tart, rich, concoction of walnuts, mild red pepper, pomegranate and other mystery ingredients. Order it. And then place an order to take home so you don’t have to share. Speaking of not sharing, I had intended to share my warak inab with my friends. After one lemony, savory, yummy bite—no way. These are stuffed grape leaves like mama would have made if mama was Middle Eastern. Why are you still reading? Ge thee to Kobobogee!</Text></record>

Amazing Lebanese restaurant.  Even better than the ones in Glendale, where there's a large Lebanese and Armenian community.  Nabih is the owner and a one of the nicest people you'll meet.  We love coming here and always do when we get a chance</text>

Went for dinner with my wife and daughter. The food was very authentic. Everything was prepared with quality ingredients. This place is find for anyone who wants authentic Lebanese food. Everything was well prepared and the service was fast and friendly. Not sure how busy they are at lunch, at dinner there was no waiting. We were served immediately and the food was fresh and hot.<//Text>

I like this place. I have been to this place quite a few times now.

The best part I like here is those hot pita bread and hummus which is being served before your order arrive. Some time I feel that skip lunch or dinner and just keep going on with those pita bread and hummus.

My personal favorite is Vegetarian Makhlubi and Jallab(rose water and dates drink).<//text>

< Review>
This is the best Lebanese food I've had in 30 years. Grew up in a Lebanese restaurant...so I know real food.

They use the best and most fresh ingredients and have standards, that I have only seen in Michelin Star rated restaurants without paying the High Prices!

I have filled up for $10 to $20, on average.

They even went out of their way to make a complicated dish of a special stuffed eggplant dish as a special order.  They went out and bought the ingredients and it was ready when I came in at a scheduled time

Great Decore and atmosphere and this is a favorite place for all the nearby business folks.

Give these guys a try.  You definitely will not want go any place else after eating the best lebanese food in town.

Very Fresh baklava too< /Review>

The best place for getting Lebanese in town im my opinion, i work right by here and Mediterranean food is my all time fav and have tried countless places in sd, nothing ever compares to the flavors here, it can be pricey but if you go for lunch you can get some big portions for cheaper, i would recommend to everyone i know< /text>

(Translated by Google) I am frankly the managers of the high evaluation on the Aish .. Very bad restaurant .. rice is bad .. chicken and meat are all bad .. what I would never recommend ..
Don't go to this restaurant .. Not good at all

Fred & Sherry were sooooooo helpful.   Someone ordered a giant artwork and I did not realize how expensive it was going to cost.  It was 24x36x2 inches and I was told $75-100+ to get to Sacramento.   I was so stressed because that was going to cut into my pay for the work.  Luckily Fred helped me to figure out a better way.  My little bro happened to be in town so he could drive it back, I gave gas $$, but I still needed a box but didnt want to pay $25 for a shipping box so I bought a moving box for $10.  Fred helped me package it up while Sherry womanned the fort.  Thanks so much!!!< /review>

This review is for Karen but also the rest of the team, I came in having to ship a large box with heavy computer equipment, a bit frantic about the price. Karen was extremely helpful in showing me the right options to make, that fit my price point. She kind, explained things thoroughly and gently. I highly recommend this ups location.<//Text>

This review is for FRED! He is the rock star who always has a smile on his face, a friendly disposition, and extremely helpful attitude! This store is often really busy, especially during COVID and the holidays, but Fred always takes care of business and does it with a smile! He never gets frustrated, seems overwhelmed, or loses his amazing customer service when the store is busy or running behind. I am always so thankful to work with him when I come in because I know he will take care of my packages AND he makes me smile because he is so kind and helpful. He goes out of his way to make your day better and that is hard to find nowadays. Fred, you are awesome! Keep doing what you are doing! We appreciate you!!</Review>

My wife and I came in on Sunday as we needed to get something notarized to send out. Fred was amazing and was so kind and hospitable to everyone that came in the store. Just wanted to leave a positive review as Fred is amazing at his job and he went above and beyond and went the extra mile for every person that came through the door while we were there - even so much as to offer colored pencils and paper to a child who was waiting with her father to fill out a form in line so she wouldn't get bored. Well done Fred and thank you for all that you do to spread kindness and joy during this time!< /text>

Contacted location manager but just trying to make me feel was my mistake for following their employee instruction, did nothing for us to start an investigation.</Text>< name>

<Text>I purchased a box here in August 2018,  and it one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.  The staff is always friendly,  helpful,  and just awesome people.  I look foreword to each visit.  If you you’re looking for excellent customer service,  this UPS store is the place!  I would like to express my sincere thanks publicly.<//Text>< pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I came to this store with a very challenging shipment. They not only took the time to understand my needs and listen to my concerns, but they immediately started to pack my shipment so I could see the care they would take. Not only that but the store was busy at the time and multiple staff members took the time to assist me and to make me fell comfortable in the care they were taking with my request.

I am happy to report that my entire shipment arrived as promised, in perfect condition, and packed expertly to ensure the safety of the contents. While I do not live near this store (I am out of state in Colorado) if I ever have any shipping needs in that area again I will not hesitate to use them again.

<text>My favorite and I think the best UPS store in my area including Hillcrest and downtown/Market St. Everyone is so courteous, professional and so helpful! Last time I needed to print a shipping label for eBay but I have no printer and just expected to have to pay for my shipping but the associate said I could forward the email to the store and he would print it for me so I didn't have to pay for the shipping! Super happy! Thanks for the great customer service, 5- stars!<//text>< Response>

They've gone the extra mile for me multiple times and I see them so it for others.

< Review>
Never back!!! The service was awful!!!! The manager is the rudest person that I've ever met! Maybe this place is ok to make a copy or to print your shipping label, but do not go to print marketing materials there!

I visited this UPS Store and I was told they have a law sign as an outdoor option and I could get it same-day of order. A couple days later I came back and ask for printing an outdoor banner from my flash-card. Because it was the same guy of maintenance staff, he did not ask me any additional questions and just printed out a banner. I was charged before I saw the finished product.
Unfortunately, the banner is totally different from what I expected and the service was inadequate because the maintenance staff and the main manager are not familiar with the printing procedures but tried to ensure that the printed banner is vinyl that can be used outdoors. But in fact, it was photo paper gloss that it breaks easily. The manager spoke with me rude and was not interested in solving the problem. Unacceptable!!!! Go choose another job if are not satisfied!!</Review>

<review>This review will be followed with complaints to UPS at the corporate level as well. The maintenance staff and main manager are not familiar with the printing procedures. By solving the problem with my poster the manager was really rude and and talked with me aggressively. I was in so much shock by the customer service here. I refuse to go back to this location or let any of my clients and businesses use UPS. I strongly suggest she go through training or face termination in her position at this UPS location. An absolute disgrace.<//review><Time>1553024431708<//Time><pictures>None<//pictures>< rating>

The hubby and I just landed in San Diego and needed a notary asap for a work document that needed to be sent out. The owner, Burk and assistant manager Lina were so helpful and efficient. They were so accommodating to our children as well, giving them free office supplies to keep them busy. If we lived here we would have this as our permanent store.<//Text>

<text>So in the effort of helping business that I think are "Doing it right" I am posting the same review here that I posted on Yelp

I went in to ship a package. I had them pack it becuase I was shipping a a few picture frams and a vase, and wanted to make sure it all got there in one piece.  Happy to report that it did in fact make it to NJ as promised and in one piece :-)

The staff was super helpful and friendly. Glad this place is now opened, I'll definitely be back!

Either your store or the local delivery drives are the worst I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with.  The drivers habitually lie about attempting deliveries.  Also, when I am checking the status of a delivery that says "Will be delivered by 8 PM" and at 7:45 PM it updates to A carrier delay has occurred at 7:21 PM trying to act like it was updated prior.< /Text>

Mailed a package from this store on Saturday and tried to track the package today. When the tracking number didn't work I called the store to get some assistance and they hung up on me midway through after I asked if they could look the package up by receipt #.</review>

Great location, it’s where fuel is scarce. They have a small store with good coffee, and will always turn on the air compressor for you, and with a smile. The superstructure is what one would expect being located right on the beach.<//Text>

Do not even bother to go here. It's convenient, sure. But their business practices are so shady. They turn employees against each other, make promises of higher pay and then don't follow thru and then just don't even pay people for the hours they work. The new manager is just another cog in their use and abuse cycle. They literally just lost 3 employees in the last week because they have no sense of right and wrong. Just all in all, if you want to contribute to their icky ways if doing things, sure go ahead and shop here. If you think businesses should respect their employees and not be shady and illegal in their actions, please take your business elsewhere.</Text>

<text>Friendly staff. Only disconcerting thing is not sure about closing hours. Yesterday,  Saturday October 07, 2018 10:00p.m. they were closed already when I needed gas real bad. No major for me. All in all, though a bit expensive, well worth the stop.</text>< pictures>

<text>Great experience ordering through Door dash here on Superbowl Sunday. We ordered 1.5lbs of wings, Beer Pretzels and a grass fed burger. Everything came perfectly portioned and packaged, and was ready within 30 minutes for pick-up.

The wings were great, and actually quite a value for how many you get. The chicken was juicy and succulent, and well flavored with buffalo sauce. It was so much my wife and I couldn't finished them all with everything things else we ordered. The pretzels were also spot hitting, and a good balance of soft on the inside with just the amount of salty stiffness on the outside(and perfectly paired with the spicy mustard dipping sauce). Finally the burger came with a soft and buttery bun, with plenty of avocado, bacon and cheese as well. The meat was overflowing with juicy goodness, and the whole thing together was incredibly filling.

All in all a great takeout experience, would definitely order here again!<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJiKWJYOGUX2T5aZxvn-HKjwseQybjM5vY_Sf6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-ctEOzXK6bZsOeqdlAamHLDxPTPj-RbkTkt1Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

<Review>Not talking about drinks for this review, everything else is game.

The food is really good, the fish and chips had just the right amount of batter and fish. The pork chops were a surprise to be had.

The staff being barebones at the time were a great, not missing a beat and being really friendly. Overall, a nice place to eat for being a few blocks away from the pier.<//Review><user>111465132367971952266</user>< Date>

What a great surprise this place was regarding food and the wine selection.   I had the pork chops and they were delicious along with a very reasonably priced bottle of red wine (cab) for our table.  Well worth a try.< /Text>

Karl Strauss did a good job keeping the tables clean and making their guests feel safe. Can't wait till this place opens fully up again but enjoyed the outdoor patio.<//review>

I dine in this great spot quite a bit! This is my favorite restaurant to have a bite.  I visit this place frequently. The meals are just great, the staff members are courteous and the rates are affordable. I enjoy eating in this spot over a good dinner.<//Text>

We took some guests from out of town. Food was fantastic but the dining experience was less than stellar. They had just reopened the dining area but it wasn't table service. You order via phone app and the food was served in to go containers with plastic silverware. Drinks were served in glasses and they had wait staff but overall not happy with the service. Not what I had hoped to share with our friends...<//review>

Very cool spot for a beer. The new outside seating is awesome. Can order from the table with a QR code. No need to go to the bar for a drink.<//review>

The overall location seemed very outdated from appearance to music. The food is very bland and not seasoned. As for the beer itself, I enjoyed Wreck Alley and the Kettle Sour. I would only return to try the Beeramisu. Great bar for old timers and vets, but too old school for the newer generations.</text>

Food is very good, but they have a homeless problem that makes patrons eating outdoor feel unsafe and bothered.  I originally sat outside in their outdoor seating area.  At the table next to me was a young lady who was eating her burger.  A homeless guy with a bottle of wine came up to her and demanded she give him food.  She gave him her entire order of fries.  He took it and forcefully threw it against the brick wall of the restaurant, with all the fries falling onto the sidewalk.  The lady looked like she was scared and shocked.  We couldn't believe it.  He then sat at the table behind me with his wine bottle and was mumbling to himself.  My colleague felt uncomfortable, so we moved to another table on the Premises of the restaurant.  I told the staff about the homeless guy, and a staff member stated that the same homeless guy always hangs out in the area and hates the Karl Strauss sidewalk signs because he kicks them down.  I was pretty shocked and upset that (1) they know this guy is always there potentially and/or actually bothering patrons and (2) that they haven't done anything about it.  Even after complaining about this guy, it took a while for the staff to ask him to leave.  Not acceptable, especially when customer's food is taken and customers feel threatened, bothered, annoyed, and scared while eating.</Text>

Cool beer choice and good food menu.
I like this place.
But be aware about parking...it's downtown.</Review>

I take my family to this restaurant  a lot! This is my favorite spot to grab a bite.  I go there many times. The cooking is great, the staff members are courteous and the prices are affordable. I like being in this spot for a nice supper.< /text>

Nice city patio area. Waitstaff was friendly and accommodating. Beer was good. They have a lot of IPAs if that's your thing. The Hefeweizen was good. The "Big Beer Burger" was tasty but they did overcook it but being so hungry there was no time for a do-over. Short walking distance from the hotels . Worth a check out.</review>

Ahi Salad and the Piggy Mac (bacon and ham!) were both great, the happy hour was legit ($5 beer and select dishes, we had the wings presented well and very tasty!), and the food came out super fast!

Incredibly impressed with the service. Not at all unhappy at the 3% surcharge that they add pretax for increasing costs. Very good value and fun atmosphere. Would definitely come again.</Text>

Great homey spot. Casually dropped while on a stroll.  Very attentive staff/bar keep.  Great tasting beers—tried various samples.  Did not eat there but the food did look very appetizing.< /review>

Been here twice now and still just as good as the last time. Beer is top notch and the staff was great even gave us some tips on how to eat the pork bell. Everything was great. Definitely a nice causal place to eat out for a date with the wife.</Text>

It was my first time ordering from Karl Strauss Brewery & Grill. The menu looked good, so I thought I'd order some chili cheese fries, and the Double Truffle fries. They Were Amazing, but I was expecting a little more than what I got. I went back in and explained it was my first time and what did the double mean on the fries. The worker was very respectful, polite, and understanding. I then was accommodated and very happy!
I will be going back to try more food on the menu!</review>

<review>Solid food and beer, in a decent sized restaurant style environment. Feels a little corporate but the quality of the beer and food is top notch. Good place for kids and groups, and wasn’t overly crowded on a nice Saturday. Service was the only thing was a little slow considering it wasn’t too busy. Once served, everything else was great. Enjoyed the Boat Shoes Hazy IPA as a good warm day sipper.<//review>< Pics>

Had the nicest time with my girlfriend, the music wasn't too loud and the beer was amazing. We ate their Beer Sausage which we highly recommend. Overall very good service. Will definitely go again once I'm back in San Diego. Thanks!<//Review>

This is quite the popular lunch location. Place was totally booming, which is always a good sign. The beer was very good and very fresh. Their Boat Shoes and their 10 Breakfasts were so amazing and bursting with flavor. Could have stayed all day just enjoying those. Their Asada Fries were a perfect app to share and good to the last scrape off the plate. Lots of flavor with a right fine beer cheese that married well with the beef. The Mac n Cheese was another perfect dish, homey and comforting with a nice smattering of sausage and bacon... Who doesn't enjoy good bacon? Overall it was a great place to stop in and try a new couple of beers and a few tasty eats.<//text>

A group of friends and I walked in here about 45 mins to an hour before they closed. We were happily greeted and seated. Drinks were on point, server was amazing, food was delicious. We got fairly buzzed and had an amazing time. Thank you so much. Keep doing what you do. Good times.</Text>

This is the first brew pub I ever visited (late ‘80s) and used to be really good. Not sure what happened, but it feels like a total dive now. Both the food and the beers were boring. Bummer.<//Text>

Really enjoyed our evening with the team at Karl Strauss. The beer was amazing, especially enjoyed the 'build your own flight's' option, our waiter being very knowledgeable about the product, and being able to offer suggestions on what to try next based on what we liked. They seemed to be a good mix of families, couples and groups in, which gave a really relaxed and friendly atmosphere. If you are in San Diego, and like beer, and well cooked, no nonsense food Karl Strauss is a great place to go.<//text>

<text>We went at an odd time of day. We ate inside, though there is patio seating. The atmosphere was very nice and relaxing.

We had the chicken pobloma quesadillas, chili, and the chicken habanero sandwich. The food was delicious, the service mediocre. I would go there again.</text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Date>

Great beer and the food was really good too! Service was good as well. We are a bit of beer snobs as we are spoiled with some really good beers near us on the East coast, but this was definitely a good stop on our little West coast brew tour. Definitely recommend< /text>

Darlene was right on top of 8service and the other wait staff worked well together.  They brew some really tasty beers.  The burger was top notch and they do a pretty mean brussel sprouts with bacon,  peanut butter porter for dessert.</text>

<review>Karl Strauss Brewery had an opportunity to make a good impression on me when I visited 6 October 2018, early evening.  I skimmed the reviews prior to starting this one.  As usual, people are way to liberal in "handing out" 5 star ratings.  At best on a 1-5 scale, this establishment rates a 4.  To me 5 stars is the best of the best in service/aesthetics/food quality and value.  Get real!  Karl Strauss rates in the range of (3.8-4.2), using a more open scale.  I started with the Wreck Alley Porter, ordered the rice/quinoa bowl with Ahi tuna another beer, the Red Trolley, and finished with the bread pudding.  The beer was excellent, both were what I expect with the  two different offerings.  Unless you like and appreciate a Porter and/or an Ale you cannot fathom my meaning.  The quinoa/rice bowl was clean, colorful, and tasted rich with the spicy topping which enhanced the ahi tuna.  The portion was decent for the price, so the eating experience was visually appealing,  pleased the palate and accentuated by the beer.  The bread pudding was very good, in the top (3) I have experienced.  A heavy/compact texture, not overly sweet even with the ice cream and drizzle.  A little short on the vanilla/nutmeg/spice flavors.  The service at the bar was (good), not great as the bar seats were only 50% occupied.  Overall, very satisfying and a very good meal.  The aesthetics lacked charm.  I remember a big open area with some booths/tables, a bar and some brewing vats and equipment.  Enjoy!  (See pics)<//review>< Name>

<Review>I didn’t have plans to visit Karl Strauss because there are so many great local breweries in the area that I prefer. However a friend texted and asked me to meet there so I agreed. I tried a flight of their beers and they were just OK, nothing great and nothing that left me wanting to order more. It is a nice looking place with a comfortable atmosphere.</Review><resp>None</resp><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqHdabQqPlnjhdFr6vbaW36UXsztvLfrHsV6mK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Gmap_id>0x80d954a95e9f8e7f:0xd9508bb40c9511</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Conveniently located craft brewery with excellent service. The bartender was knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly!  I walked in 15 minutes to closing for a beer and was welcomed in to sit and was given both the tap menu and food menu. The few people who sat down after me were greeted in the same manner! I definitely have to return and try some more brew!</Review>

<text>Everything here was pretty good, but nothing really stood out for me.  They also messed up our order a bit.  They fixed it, but that plus everything just being OK led to the 4 star.  I'd come back here, but I wouldn't seek it out.< /text>< pictures>

I had the habenero chicken sandwich, and boat show IPA. I loved both, and the atmosphere was relaxed. The staff were very attentive and friendly.</review>

A good place for a sandwich, gets really busy during lunchtime so be prepared to wait if you arrive during peak hours.< /review>

<Text>We picked this place as we were looking for something quick after checking into our hotel.  They brew their own beer and offer a large selection of food all of which looked delicious as we saw other tables being served.  As it was Oktoberfest we opted for the sausage and beer pretzel.  The staff here were super friendly and informative, always checking in to make sure everything was good and we had everything we needed.  Service was A+.

Beer Pretzels:
This was a giant serving.  Each order comes with 2 spice-rubbed pretzels, spicy honey mustard, house-made beer cheese.  The exterior had a nice rub on it with a bit of chew while the inside stayed nice and tender. The side of sauces were wonderful as well and paired perfectly with the pretzel.  Definitely a sharing plate as it gets quite filling.

Beer Sausages:
Made with Tower 10 IPA and served with 2 links. A grilled cheddar brat and a chili-chicken, with garlic sweet potatoes, frisee, arugula, herb oil, pickled onions, and spicy honey-sriracha mustard.  The sausages were great with the perfect snap and chew, seasoned well.  However the sweet potatoes were lack luster, they could have used a little bit longer in the fryer as they were a bit limp.  However it could have been the fact they covered them with the pickled onions and greens. If the intent was to have crispy sweet potato with a fresh frisee arugula salad then execution was a bit off.  Putting fresh green on hot items is a big NONO for me, ends up making the crispy stuff soggy, and the greens wilt losing its freshness and crunch.</Text>< gmapID>

This place holds up. Decor is a little behind the times but still charming. Great food to back up a traditional brew line up.

All very well made, and the older design of the place means that i can actually hear the people at my table without shouting. 10/10<//Review>

The scene was great, lively and busy but not to loud to have a conversation.

I have never had a bad experience here. Last time I was here there was a minor issue with a homeless person and they took care of it quickly and quietly. The food is always spectacular. I don't care much for beer, but I try the ones my husband gets and they are definitely better than some others I've tried.</Review>

Great Beers( obviously) and really nice staff. I like the small outside patio seating, very good location away from the typically more crowded gaslight district.  One of my favs.

<Review>Friendly staff, delicious food. These carne asada fries were spicy while still maintaining an excellent flavor profile, and the pickled onions offered a nice acidic pop. The lunch crowd comes in by 1200, so 1130 (when they open) is your safest bet if you’re in a hurry.</Review></record>

< Review>
Karl Strauss has been making great beer in San Diego since 1989. They always have their tasty go-to beers like Red Trolley and Tower 10, but they always make a point to try new recipes and styles. The food here is a little pricey for the style, but it tastes good and the portions are ample. They used to do special casks every Thursday night, but not sure if that is still happening. Quality spot.</Review>

The beer here is good, but they seem to cater towards a more “masculine” pallet. Lots of IPA’s and stouts and porters. The sours that I’ve tried are definitely very sour. I haven’t ever had a beer here that I loved. The outdoor seating is cozy and dog friendly. We got sat immediately as it was a little chilly out, so only dog lovers were outside. A good location near the train station. Perfect for a happy hour drink.< /text>

Had a fried cauliflower (without glaze) and a salad, both were great. We went at a quieter time for an early lunch, the atmosphere was nice. Would happily go back.

The one disappointment was that their "chili aioli" tasted more like mustard. I got this as a sauce for dipping the cauliflower, so just didn't have much. My wife, however got a burger that had this on it and didn't care for it or ending up eating much of it.</Review>

<review>I'm not really into beer, so I will speak about the food... order the Pork Chop! I've had that almost everytime I've been to Karl Strauss. The apps are good, the burgers are good. Good service. The last time we were there, we discovered they don't serve the mashed potatoes with the pork chops anymore which is why we haven't been going as much.

Also good: all the macs!</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Very high quality bar style but better than bar food paired with high quality micro brew.  The beers and specials change but I find it exciting to try something I didn't even know existed paired with my favorite seasonal brews.  If you like micro you have to at least check this place out.< /Text>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>The deserts were good and I like the variety of beers. The staff sas also friendly. Our bartender was great with helping us find a beer that we liked. The 3% service fee is annoying and kind of sneak. Most places raise their prices with inflation instead of sneaking 3% surcharges. I won't go back solely for that reason.<//Text>< GmapID>

This is a brewery, their beer selection is very nice. Great place to bring a group of friends or even romantic enough to take a date. Decor seems a little dated to me. But the food and beer is delicious portions are a little small. Happy hour is nice.  Overall you would have a good time by visiting this place< /Review>

First off the service, drinks, and food here are first class. Everyone is friendly and I personally love the t10 burger. Whatever you get this place has amazing spirits to pair with your meal! My server (Laura) was awesome and never missed a beat. 10/10 place, would eat here again and highly recommend!!!< /review>

The original location of San Diego's original micro brewery.  The original beers are still exceptional while a great selection of newer recipes are available.  Great intimate setting.< /Review>

The food is good.  The boneless wings is more like chicken tenders.  The shrimp and grits is  good but has a unique aftertaste that was unappealing to me. Maybe that is because I don't like avocado. I didn't ask and the server failed to say if the beer can on the table is for us to drink or if it had to be purchased separately. The environment was rather calm in the afternoon.<//Review>

Walked in alone for dinner. Had a very nice burger with blue cheese. Not much of a beer guy myself but the one I order taste good, and afterwards they have a free sample beer too. The burger itself taste great. Juicy and not too salty. The cheese dressing is ok, but not the blue cheese I'm thinking.< /Text>

The craft beer was top notch and reasonably priced. A definite craft beer atmosphere.

Love this place but 3%surcharge?

Food is great, Healthy choices available and family friendly.  When we go to San Diego from Phoenix we don't bother going anywhere else.  But 3%surcharge means a  boost in the menu prices and just a sneaky way to do it.</Review>

<review>They have the best beer, and a dog friendly patio. Not much for merchandise, but I'm not really there for the souvenirs anyway. Though it would be nice to show off that I was there. Still, the Red Trolley Ale brings me in, but all the other beers are phenomenal.< /review><name>Tiffany Schmidt< /name><UserId.>115436666871314338574< /UserId.>< GmapID>

All we had was extremely good, we tried the shrimp sandwich, the beer sausages, the chicken with quinoa, the beer hamburger, a stout beer, everything delicious, the place is quite comfortable, clean, service is great.

Unfortunately they have this policy of adding 3% extra before taxes because their life is tough, or so... So I left 15% tip, before taxes and before the 3% extra, that makes a 18% before taxes. Life is tough for everyone.< /text>

<Text>Service was average. Prices are a little high. Food was not great. My sandwich sub roll was burnt to the point that it was black. Ruined the entire sandwich. Hubby's stuffed burger was just a plain burger. Also, a 3% surcharge is added to every check before taxes to keep prices low?! Um, that makes absolutely no sense. Wouldn't bother returning ever.</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80d954a95e9f8e7f:0xd9508bb40c9511<//GmapID></record>

It was a bit dark, perhaps dated and could use some fresh air.  When I first walked in the smell of stale beer reminded me of a college bar the day after a big event.

Just stopped in for a quick drink and some hot wings.  The wings left a lot to be desired. They were overcooked, had a peculiar texture, lukewarm and bland.  I think they may have been suffering from freezer burn.<//Text>< resp>

Good food, pretty good beer, poorly managed.

Showed up to a half empty restaurant.  Our server was really stressed with how many tables she had to cover.  The food came and she had forgotten the beer... something of a cardinal sin at a "brewery."  I reminded her, she apologized, then proceeded to take water to a different table, then take the order from yet another.

I had to go outside to work out my impatience and figured out what was going on when I came back in.  Two managers were at a table, laptop open, definitely not in tune with their staff's load, much less lending a helping hand.

There's a 3% surcharge on the bill for the increasing cost of labor, ironically.

It's still not a bad choice for the area, which is pretty light on offerings (near the train station).</review>

Great option when downtown and hungry. Friendly kitchen hours and lots of food options. No gluten free beer though.< /Text>

<text>Good was so good and the beer was fantastic. The pilsner was the best I've had. It has such a lovely after taste. I normally do not drink pilsner because of the bitter after taste they tend to have. I highly recommend!< /text></record></dataset><record>

The host was very demeaning. I reserved a patio table because I was bringing the dog, (making the reservation was actually very easy). Once I arrived I was told patio seating could not be reserved, in a manner like this is just sooo obvious! Well, obviously I didn't know, because your own staff didn't know and confirmed I had a patio table reserved. Then the host was like "Well this is all I've got!", pointing at a 2 person table, when we had 3 people and a dog. No apologies given at all.

Beer is good, thankfully. Ordered a salad for $15 and it was a couple bites, then done.

I was meeting up with family friends I had not seen in 3 years, and so we were just waiting around for a table outside, even though I told them ahead of time about the reservation. It certainly looked bad on me, especially since the restaurant didn't take responsibility for the mix up (else I would have understood). Awkward situation to put me in, dudes.<//Text>

This brew pub is bloody amazing!  The beer is incredible, the food is like nothing else.  Every mouthful is like the emperor himself did something amazing in my mouth!  But they don't have onion rings.  This review may or may not be influenced by the influence ;)< /Text>

< Review>
I was very pleased with the service and the great beer selection, and so were my friends.  They couldn't stop talking about how good the peanut butter cup porter was.

We did run into a little snag when we ordered our food. We decided to order nachos and they told us they just ran out of tortilla chips (because they make them fresh every day).  So instead, they recommended having it with fries, so we took a chance.  Boy, did they come out awesome or what?!  It was the best nacho fries I've ever had. . . actually the only time I've had nacho fries.

All in all, it was a great experience and I hope to go back soon.< /Review>

Kind of dingy and smelled like spoiled beer. Food is pretty good, a little pricey for a burger I'd say. But now they add a 3% surcharge. Why they don't just raise their prices? I really don't like being exta taxed when I go out to eat.

I won't be back. Plenty of other places to spend that kind of money on who don't gouge me.

Service wasn't good. Had to ask for water 3 times. No refills offered either.< /text>

The food is amazing. You can’t go wrong with any of it! But if you’re at all interested in the chili-lime sweet potato fries, get them. They’re delicious, and served with a sriracha Ranch.

Service is consistently friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt. They are very generous with free beer tasters, as well.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80d954a95e9f8e7f:0xd9508bb40c9511<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I had been in San Diego for 2 weeks and was staying around the corner from this brewery at the Renaissance. It became a favorite of mine...great food and delicious taps! A definite must try when staying in downtown! Very friendly staff. The beer and plate pairings were perfect! You must try this brewery.< /review>

<Text>Very nice selection of beers and delicious food! It was very close to our hotel the Westin. We got the cheese fondue, two burgers and the pretzels. The waiters and barman were very nice. Be aware of the 3% tax added to support their staffs.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

A little disappointed by the French baguette. Seemed one of Costco's.
Bread, made with yeast like beer, should be top notch in a brewery< /Review>< pictures>

<Name>Robert Guel<//Name><Review>The food and beer is delicious,  the bartenders  have great knowledge of brewing beer. The people you meet while sitting at the bar are some of the most friendliness and interesting I've every meet. They have happy hour specials from 3 to 6, 4$ pints and on Friday the price to refill your growler is only $9. That's the best price in San Diego.< /Review>< Response>

The food is always delicious, the severs in the south are stuck up... you have to warm up to them before they are nice to you. Beer is always amazing and so is the food. Always try the small batch beer . Sorry no pics, I enjoy the moment<//Review>

The Mosaic IPA is in the running for my favorite beer! Fantastic, inventive brews coupled with really good food makes this a must stop when in San Diego. They offer ample samples to pair their beers with whatever you're eating, or just to let you try something new.</text>

First of all, I would love to thank my server Samantha for two big reasons! I went here as a birthday treat to myself since I am from out of town and it was close by to my hotel. Her service was beyond amazing! Not only was she super warm and helpful, she definitely provided excellent customer service, along with the other staff that came and checked on me here and there. The pork chops were amazing and the beers that she suggested and let me sample were great as well!
Now the other reason I would like to thank her and the people that helped. As I was sitting by myself, a man approached me while I was eating to make covernsation and definitely made me feel uncomfortable. Not only did she and the staff notice how I felt, they handled it well and kept an eye out for me while I had a bit of time to sober up and get my lyft. The fact that I felt taken care of as not only a customer, but a person as well is why I am giving this place 5 stars. I definitely recommend this place to people and I hope to go back soon!< /text>

Great bar / restaurant with its own on-premise micro brewery. Food and drink is reasonably priced for the area. The beer is great and you can have a small taster before you order a pint! It does get busy at peak times.< /Text>

The scene was great, lively and busy but not to loud to have a conversation.
The staff were wonderful kind knowledgeable about the beer and food.
Overall I Absolutely love this place and cannot wait to come back.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Stopped for dinner and a few beers before heading to Petco Park for a Padres/Brewers game.  The service, food, and beer was all excellent and our server was more than happy to talk to us about recommended pairings for anything and everything we were considering from starters to main course.  Would absolutely go back.< /review>

Tasty beer and grub. The Mac and cheese will change your life for the better. We also shared the Gouda burger and it was a perfect combo of savory with sweet fig jam. The beers are brewed locally and there's special in house beer on tap. A great culinary experience, way more than pub food.</Review>

If you want to try lots of their beer, get a flight (4 5oz samples for 4$ on happy hour) to figure out what you like best.< /Review></record>

Great beer and delicious food! The duck fat pretzel bites were wonderful. Service was also excellent and the outdoor seating was lovely. The bathrooms were blasting cold air, that is my only complaint, but not a deal breaker in the slightest.< /text>

<review>Excellent service for our 20 person party. The food was upscale. The beer was mediocre, but I'm kind of a snob about beer. The acoustics inside we're horrible.  Super echouy. They could really use some sound absorbers on the ceiling. The bathrooms weren't less than expected considering the atmosphere and that was projected.<//review>< UserId.>

Food is outstanding, beer excellent also.  Service was very good the night I stopped in.  I had a Salmon fillet with steamed veggies and zippy ginger sauce.  The fish was cooker perfectly, and the veggies steamed just right.  Karl's take on an IPA was just to my liking also.</text>

< review>
Really nice staff but a lacklustre experience.  The story goes that absolutely everything is made in house, but the ahi tuna burger tasted rubbery and formed.  Flaky and seared says "fresh" to me.  For beers, the Mosaic wheat is fantastic, but this place CANNOT do big beers.  Tower 20 tastes more like vodka than beer with absolutely no hop flavour.  Underwhelming experience.< /review>

Convenient location in downtown San Diego. Offers several beers on draft with a high concentration on IPA styles. Good food.<//Review>

<Time>1408890731553< /Time><name>Neil Howell</name><text>The food and beer were excellent.  Service, when there were people, was excellent as well.  I liked how they would bring samples of different beers that would go with what you  were eating.

The unfortunate thing was that our server was tasked with working behind the bar for awhile...not just a few minutes.  How ever he was called to do that, his whole section was not covered.  Fortunately, we were almost done with our meal...unfortunately, I wasn't sure if we would ever get our check.  We finally had to stop another server to get that going, and even that took awhile.

Service was great, but when it flops, it flops hard.< /text></record>

Deluxe beer, good burger, near court house. I was waiting for the public defenders to get off lunch break so I decided to go for lunch myself. Would have been five stars, but to say it was a 5 star restaurant I would have been able to pick my own cow for my burger.< /Review>

A little quiet on A Sunday, which was perfect, actually. Had brunch down on the water at the Harbor, and the food was good. But the beers / drinks were EXPENSIVE no matter where I went. I wanted to have a few more beers, so I went to Karl's.

It doesn't have the water view. But, the beers were three dollars cheaper, and the selection was better. I could watch the hockey game too, as I was on my own and the waterfront bars/restaurants were a little boring. and the Harbor was windy / chilly, even though it was nice and hot out.

I have gone to Karl's a bunch over the years, and they never disappoint. Great service, good beer. If you are heading to the Harbor area to do site seeing and want to have food and a couple pints... I recommend hitting Karl's first... Then head down and have one drink at the Harbor. Much easier on your wallet, and the walk is non existent. Take a $6.00 uber if you're too tired to walk. Great way to see downtown. It's beautiful.</text>

Had the cotija avocado turkey burger and a flight of samples. Hands down, best turkey burger I've ever had (even though it's a bit messy). Nice selection of beers - I would have liked a nitro or cask selection, but that's personal preference and picky. Great and friendly service (with unsolicited but welcome samples of more beer). All in all, would recommend and would definitely return.<//Text>

The beer was good and so was the food for the most part. The fries tasted like they were freezer burnt and there is a 3% surcharge added to your bill because of the new minimum wage law. It was OK. I won't be returning.< /Review>

Dude! So, good. The Wreck Alley Stout is where it's at! The Red Trolley Ale was also so delicious. Both were superb and hit the spot perfectly. I also had the blackened Mahi tacos, so good. It's hard to find tacos that do it slightly differentky than anywhere and yet are just as good if not better. Totally a great find.<//Text>

<Review>I had the opportunity to visit Karl Strauss when I was in San Diego recently.  I decided to try their monthly flight which consisted of four of their beers.  After I had completed the flight, I wanted to try two more tasters but had to order a whole flight of four more beers instead of being able to just get the tasters.  Oh darn, more beer for me.

While here I tried the:
Columbia Street Amber
Follow The Sun
Red Trolley Ale
Tower 10 IPA
Aurora Hoppyalis
Six Suits a Hangin
Wreck Alley Imperial Stout
Big Barrel Double IPA

The bartender was very nice but was busy and always moving.  I ordered a pretzel which is always good with beer tasting to help catch the flavors of all the different beers.</Review><user>108696520660667332471< /user></record>

I visited San Diego and stayed at a hotel near Petco Park with my dog. And I called Karl Strauss downtown and made sure if they allowed a dog.  A female employee said they allow a dog at patio.  The next day, I walked with my dog from my hotel to this bar for around 30 minutes. But a female manager said they won't allow a dog inside, patio or any place.  And I told her I already called and made sure. This bar and employees make dog lovers fool? My dog and I wasted one hour for this stupid bar. Many dog friendly information sites say this bar is dog friendly.  BUT IT IS NOT AT ALL.</text>

While in San Diego, my family and I ate here a total of three times. The staff is excellent. You never wait longer than you should for your food. The beer is great too. Expect close to $90 for a family of four to eat and have two beers.<//Review>

The patio is not pet friendly. We sat ourselves on the patio not knowing there was a hostess stand inside or that no pets were allowed. The waiter was not very courteous or friendly when he told us that we had to see the hostess and that dogs are not allowed.   The manager Victoria was nice and undetstanding and explained why pets are not allowed.     Hope to make it back and have a better experience.< /review>

This is one of many locations and although it doesn't have the beautiful koi pond the Sorrento Valley location has it still has a fun brewpub feel to it. It's not a full bar just beer and wine but has a large menu and the staff are very well trained with suggesting pairings with your meal. The food is always delicious and you can get a real meal since it's not just bar food. They do have groumet Mac and cheese and burgers!< /review>

<Text>3% service charge to "support the staff"...
instead of making a statement about the raising minimum wage... Just raise the prices of your menu items... Adding another pointless fee on top of having to tip too is an annoyance.</Text>< rate>

Although I rated the "food" Excellent, I actually only had appetizers, which were pretty good. The menu had an excellent selection. The beer was terrific though and they had several higher-gravity beers to choose from, including an outstanding oak-barrell-aged imperial stout. The cask conditioned ale was also pretty kick a$$!< /text>

<text>Underwhelming chain brewpub with room for improvement. Beer wise, flavors and styles were nothing out of the ordinary. When Stone and Ballast Point are in your area you have to compete and Karl Strauss does not. Mac and cheese, while billed as life changing, was rather soupy and undercooked with dry chicken.</text>< user_id>

The beer is good, though I didn't understand why the strong one (Wreck Ally 9% stout) can't be served in a pint sized glass. Food was well.< /review>

Serve was great! Our waitress offered suggestions and was super attentive...even though we walked in close to closing time. Great customer service. All the food looked amazing but I was happy with my choice...different take on a popular dish. Tabouli and melon salad with grilled shrimp!! It was too die for. Grilled brussel sprouts...delishes. My friend had the shrimp po'boy and a craft burger...they both said they were delishes. Craft beers...tasty and full bodied! Found this place on accident, and am so glad we did! Great food, reasonable prices, amazing customer service!!<//Review>

Maybe my review is a little biased since Karl Strauss is my favorite beer haha. The food is excellent, the beer is beyond words, and the vibe brings it all together. If you want to go to a top notch brewery in San Diego visit Karl Strauss!< /review>< user_name>

Red Trolley Ale, very good. Food, well my Prime Sirloin was excellent but the balance of the plate was meh. Restrooms, Men's room is disgusting. Urine all over the floor. Trash all about. Graffiti. Service, was good. They charge a 3% surcharge. They state this on the menu. This is so that everyone gets a fair wage. What it really is, is the restaurant passing the increase of minimum wage onto the consumer. (I don't agree with the whole fair wage nonsense, but I digress). The place feels old, not in a good way. More of a tired and worn down. Some of the booths are really small. The booth we were packed into was even too small for someone that was 6'1" and 196-lbs. The beer is good, but expensive and not worth the price point. I am not in a hurry to go back. I wouldn't necessarily say to avoid it, but just know what you are getting into.< /Text>

<text>Great food and beer. The burgers are huge. The farmhouse burger is delicious, as well as the Beer Burger. My boyfriend loves the foundo cheese appetizer and he usually gets the beer food pairing which changes monthly. Other than that, the beer is so good. The red trolley and imperial stout are my go to's. However, for me personally, I wish they had more dark beers.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Karl Strauss knows how to make beer and to make food that pairs well with their food.
We started dinner with their small-batch triple IPA. Hoppy and delicious. The new squids on the block calamari appetizer came with 2 tasty dipping sauces. For main dish we had the beer brined pork chops, piggy bank Mac n cheese and chicken quinoa bowl. All were well prepared, delicious, and delivered at a fair price. Karl Strauss does food and beer like nobody else.<//Text><resp>None</resp></record>

Very attentive service at the bar & when seated at our table. Great beer & wine selections. I loved the brussel sprouts & truffle fries. Mixed salad was good too. Everyone else said their food was good as well (ciabatta & side salad, shrimp & grits, beer- battered pretzels & ahi poke).<//Review>

<review>Karl Strauss brewing company makes good beer and pretty darn good food. We stopped in here to cool after and get a good meal after a festival. We ordered the double truffle fries. Which were fantastic!

Individually, I ordered the West coast carnitas dip and it was very good. It came with a spicy au jus that helped bring a nice flavor to the sandwich. My girlfriend ordered the fish and chips and she said they were great. The service was very good as well. I would recommend this place to future people who are curious.</review><Date>1504540405978<//Date></record>

<Text>Best experience in san diego. Incredible service, amazing beer tasting (talented brewmasters), and fun family atmosphere. Food was average that you would find at really good diner joint, but it complimented the beer so well. Recommend the beer flights so you can find your favorite brew.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Food was surprisingly extremely good (borderline gourmet).  This surprised me because I wouldn't expect this from a brewery.  However, the drinks and food were a lot more expensive than I would expect from a brew house.  All in all I would recommend, but don't bring a light wallet.<//Review>< Pics>

They add a hidden fee (or "surcharge") to your bill after the total. When I asked about it, the waitress said that it was because of the minimum wage increase. This is extremely aggravating, you shouldn't display one price on the menu and then add a fee on the whole bill, just update your menu to reflect the new price so we can decide if we want to eat/drink there or not.

Shame on you! Bad business model and I think it might even be illegal. I smell a lawsuit coming.

Bottom line, I will not dine in this place again.</review>

<text>The quality is getting better, but they have a way to go before they can compete with the top breweries in the county. Having said that, cask Thursdays are usually good.< /text>< user>

The beer is good, the service as well. Some of the food was just ok. I personally had spicy shrimp and grits. It is in the sause with the grits, and shrimps were with hardshell tails on I didn't appreciate that , in order to get the whole shrimp you would have to take it in your hands to remove it from the tail, and then you get real dirty. I went to a different Karl Strauss and the same dish was made without hardshell tail. Other than that it was ok.</Text>

BLUF - A reliable BrewPub that consistently delivers tasty food and a great beer selection.

Service - 5/5 Prompt and friendly, completely knowledgeable about the menu and the character profile of the beers on offer.

Personality - 4/5 I have never thought this place had a great personality, but I have never gone to Karl Strauss for that, just the beer selection. It is a comfortable and relaxed place to have beers with friends, which is all it really needs to be.

Quality - 5/5 Beer, 4/5 Food. Two ratings because the beer is always the star and the food is a nice compliment to it. The most unique thing there is the Mac and Cheese, which is worth the trip alone, and everything else on the menu is delicious but not gourmet.

Recommendation - 4/5 A great BrewPub that is a good backdrop to time with friends or colleagues.</Text>

Food is good, it's just prices a few more dollars than you would like for the quality.< /Review>

Hope you like hops... Dozens (well, what seemed like dozens) of hoptastic beers. If I wanted grapefruit juice... I'd drink grape fruit juice. I know this is subjective..so IMHO the IPA thing is just played out... The wine barrel aged red trolley was legit! (could be wrong on the name, but you get the jist). It was medium bodied, with a nice dark red color, semi creamy head and smooth, not too boozy. I liked the slight toffy flavor with just a tad of sweet... Reminded me of some of the finer Belgians.  It was funny because the server (who was great BTW) Said that thier regular trolley beer was one of the most popular...but not one of the dozen IPAs offered... Hummm. Food was really good, had shrimp tacos... I hoovered them.  Cheers
3 stars only for lack of diversity in the beer selection...</text>

<Review>Great food, great happy hour!  Many locations so you can always find one around town many spots!  Very unique carne Asada fries.  Piri Piri chicken could be spicier but, overall the food is excellent.  The beer is excellent and this is totally a restaurant chain of SD to be proud of! Red Trolley is a beer no advanced beer fan should miss!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I used to come here a lot more, before Petco park was constructed. I used to go to $1 beer college nights back in 1996'ish. The place is still great. Food is fine. My favorite drink is Red Trolley. They have beer sampler you can try out.

I am very thankful for Kaul Strauss because they were one of the 1st to lead the San Diego Micro Brew scene. Yippie!

This place gets packed at night. You can people under 21, but after a certain hour I think they start carding. I'm in my late 30s so I don't know if that's still true. There are many other KS breweries across San Diego now.

I celebrated my birthday a few years ago.< /Text>< name>

Food is decent,service is a little overwhelming. They add a surcharge to every bill because the owners are to cheap to pay their staff a living wage. Just add the price on the menu and no one would notice now we just see that you don't really care about your employees</text>

Great food, loved it, sadly enough, the service was terrible, it took an hour amd a half to get through a meal with my family because our server continously messed up our order from beers, sodas and food, was very disappointed with the service.< /review>

<username>Taku Kazamaki< /username><rate>5<//rate><review>(Translated by Google) You can enjoy a wide variety of beers and ingenious dishes. The idea of ​​combining green pepper and watermelon is unlikely to come up to Japanese people (laughs).
The price isn't too high (for San Diego). The clerk was also very kind!

多種多様なビールと、工夫をこらした料理を頂けます。獅子唐辛子とスイカを合わせるという発想は日本人にはなかなか出てこないでしょう（笑）

<user_name>Florian Schwark<//user_name><Text>(Translated by Google) Very tasty beers and food! It is worthwhile to taste through the beer card, which is also feasible thanks to different glass sizes! From the rather bitter "Tower 10" (IPA) to the easily digestible "Windandsea" (Bavarian Hefeweizen / Weissbier) you will find something for every taste!
The staff is very nice and happy to advise in the selection.

(Translated by Google) Good brewery. The service was outstanding even by American standards. Maybe it was also because a new colleague was just being trained.
The good service worked, although I had no intention of having a beer at first, the ladies convinced me.

The beer surprised me positively because it really tasted like here. I had had bad experiences in Portland.

The dishes were also very good. The portions are big and taste good. The Caesar's Salad, however, contains a lot of garlic. There are no comments on the other dishes.

The ambience is suitable for a brewery. The prices are ok and a visit is recommended.

(Original)
Gute Brauerei. Der Service war sogar für amerikanische Verhältnisse überragend. Eventuell lag es auch daran, dass gerade eine neue Kollegin eingearbeitet wurde.
Der gute Service hat funktioniert, obwohl ich erst nicht vor hatte ein Bier zu trinken, haben mich die Damen überzeugt.

Das Bier hat mich positiv überrascht, da es wirklich nach hier geschmeckt hat. In Portland hatte ich da schon deutlich schlechte Erfahrungen gemacht.

Auch die Speisen waren sehr gut. Die Portionen sind groß und schmecken gut. Der Caesar's Salad enthält allerdings viel Knoblauch. Bei den anderen Speisen gibt es keine Anmerkungen.

Das Ambiente ist passend zu einer Brauerei. Die Preise sind in Ordnung und ein Besuch ist zu empfehlen.<//review>

(Translated by Google) A brewery only in California and Australia, it is one of the most famous brewery in Japan.
Of course you can drink in Japan, but the fresh beer made here is exceptional! !
When you visited Hazy IPA's Boat shoes, you said it was the best. Many people say that they like this brand in Japan too, but in Japan you will not be able to pour it from a server and drink it.

The reason for reducing the number of stars is that the food is not so affordable and the taste is too strong, it is not delicious or expensive!

I bought a T-shirt as a souvenir (around $ 25) and enjoyed it.

(Original)
カリフォルニアとオーストラリアにしかないブリューワリーで、日本でも最も有名なブリューワリーの一つです。
日本でももちろん飲めますけどここで作った新鮮なビールは格別ですよ！！
Hazy IPAのBoat shoesが伺った時に一番お勧めだとおっしゃってました。この銘柄は日本でも好きだと言う方は多いです、ただ日本ではサーバーから注いで飲むことはできないでしょう。

星を一つ減らした理由は料理に関してはそこまでお求めやすくないのと味が濃すぎたとこくらいでしょうか、決して美味しくないとか高いというわけではないです！

しっかりお土産にTシャツも買って（25ドル前後）堪能させていただきました。<//text>

(Translated by Google) The place is very comfortable. The hamburger I ordered came exactly as I wanted. The meat was very juicy and delicious. The beer menu is extensive. Serving friends are knowledgeable and helpful. The kitchen is a little slow. I strongly recommend this place. You will be more than expected.
