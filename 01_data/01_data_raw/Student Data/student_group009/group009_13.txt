Most of the staff were nice but the woman who checked us out at the register was extremely rude and judgmental. When we only asked for one (1) item, she rudely said "That's all?" and then made a face when we said yes. She made us feel poor when we only wanted one treat. Plus, everything is so expensive so we only bought what we were going to eat. Horrible experience, and we left feeling embarrassed and unsatisfied.< /review>

Best place to get Disney treats without going in the park! This is the place to get Churro Toffee, homemade caramel apples and yes you can watch the talented castmembers make them! So many treats to choose from so don't miss this sweet place! Once you are inside take a number if you would like to purchase anything in the glass display areas and they will help you out. Items purchased from the shelf can be purchased at the register like normal< /review>

< Review>
They have so many cute designs. Heads up if you see something you like get it because they run out fast. We wanted to get the unicorn caramel apple but they didn't have any. But the poisoned apple was amazing. Big enough to share with kids, also they will cut the apple for you. Service is great, very helpful and sweet.</Review>

<Review>Always delicious. Favorite is the good ol peanut caramel apple and the apple pie. The krispies are delicious. The pumpkin slice one was surprisingly delicious. Also the churro toffee is a must try! Prepare to wait on virtual mobile que anytime past noon or on weekends. They also tend to sell out of certain items towards evenings so go early if there is a must have item!<//Review>< pictures>

<response>None</response><rating>3< /rating><Review>There were so many sweets, such as, chocolates, English Toffee, Chocolate Dipped Pretzel, Mickey Chocolate Truffle, colorful Jelly Beans, Popcorn, Cookies, Cake Pops, fudge, and Chocolate Covered Strawberries, etc. They also make creative candy apples and some look like Disney characters.  I bought the Chocolate Caramel Popcorn , Cake Pop , three Chocolate Covered Strawberries, and one Candy Apple Peanut Caramel

~Sweets~
Another favorite dessert that I love are the Chocolate Covered Strawberries. I bought three, milk chocolate with dark chocolate swirls, white chocolate with milk chocolate swirls, and milk chocolate sprinkled with dark chocolate  chips. Even if the strawberries were a little tart, the chocolate was rich and smooth; it was delicious.  The Candy Apple Peanut Caramel was perfectly coated with gooey caramel, crunchy peanuts and the apple was crisp. Next is the Chocolate Carmel Popcorn that tasted fresh and surprisingly not very sweet.  My daughter wanted  the Cake Pop, the cake was soft and the ears were made of marshmallows.

~Customer Service~
Based on what I bought I would rate this place four stars but I lowered it to three because the friendly attitude from the staff could be better.

~Notes~
If you have an annual pass you will receive a discount.<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
The best place for sweet treats in Downtown Disney. Very expensive, but that's what you get at Disneyland. They have a great variety of caramel apples, including some seasonal ones. I tried the cinnamon apple pie flavor and it wasn't the best, but it was good. There is also a lot of other candy, like peanut or pecan brittle, various Mickey Mouse pastries, and chocolates.< /Review>

Split this little beauty with the wifey in honor of National Peanut Butter Day...very yummy peanut butter fudge.   Great little stop for a quick treat (and sugar blast) to keep us going in the parks.<//review>

<review>On Wed night 12/4 the floor was super wet from the rain outside.  There was no notice about the floor being slippery nor were there extra mats or someone mopping up so I slipped & fell. The staff did nothing in regards to the situation.   Do not recommend going in there if you are a fall risk & its wet outside.<//review>< pictures>

Based on Walt Disney's hometown of Marceline, Missouri, this small confectionery shop offers delicious pastries and sweet treats to indulge while on a visit to the Disneyland Resort.

They have a nice selection of sweets and candy apples. They have cookies, fudge, cupcakes, cake pops, chocolate covered strawberries, etc. I'm not sure where else they offer it, but they have a pineapple slice dipped in dark chocolate and it's so good! Must try! They also have a delicious white chocolate raspberry cookie. Tons of guest stop by to observe and admire the cast members working on the candy apples. They have such cute designs, especially closer to Halloween and the holidays.

They also have some items already boxed up and ready for purchase such as cookies, candy, and teas. They have a small selection of mugs and kitchen items, but for more variety I would head over to World of Disney.<//text>

<text>If you have a sweet tooth this is the place to be.   It's fun watching them decorate the candy apples in the window.   We come here once a year and they always have a new character they're crafting.   Because this place is so busy you have to take a number even if you're just passing for items you get in the store.   Their prepackaged  fudge is a good price for the amount you get.< /text>< pictures>

<review>Overpriced junk. We ordered a Mickey chocolate cupcake, a Minnie cake pop, and a Sorcerer Mickey caramel apple. The cupcake was extremely dry and tasted like chemicals, the frosting tasted like a cold hunk of butter. The cake pop was flavorless and the caramel apple was the worst I've ever tasted. We were extremely disappointed.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

The best candy apples come from here. Yes they are a bit expensive but when you see that smile on your kids face it makes it worth it. The staff is friendly and very helpful. Watching the chocolateers make the apples is so much fun. The prepackaged stuff is Disney expensive so we stay clear of that. The apples are the main reason we hit them up.< /text>

The best place to go for Disney made pastries. Not only is this outside the park and open later, but it serves every single item sold at any pastry shop in the resort, and has a great selection of prepackaged foods, like tea, cookies and candies. A must stop!</review>

Voicemail states any "Future Orders" is a weeks notice but they Do Not Ship any of their products... You would have to come in to purchase! They have stated they discontinue a certain product but they have it in the theme parks?? I give them a 1 star<//Review>< Pictures>

The caramel apple was phenomenal and totally a 5 star item. They lost star because they do not cut the caramel apples into pieces like everywhere else. The reason they gave was that they may hurt themselves. Instead they offered a plastic knife to my husband. He asked if it was okay if he cut himself. Their response was a little snarky.</review>

<review>They screwed up. They couldn’t find my vain. The guy was inexperienced. He put the needle in my vain a few times and he was twisting it and couldn’t find the main one. I asked for someone with more experience she could find it but after she was done I got a big bruise on my arm and it was sooo tense that o freaked out. I wanted to talk to the manager but it was already closed. Please don’t go to this location. They don’t know what they are doing. It’s not obvious in the pic but it hurt a lot.</review>< Response>

Anytime I need to get blood work done, I come here at 7am and wait less than 15 minutes (more like 3 mins). This morning Katie did my blood draw and I barely felt a thing. Most of the phlebotomists are good but she was extra gentle and friendly.</Review>

Honestly my appointment went as quick/smooth as it could. I arrived at 2pm and was done in 10 mins. Everyone including the front desk, technician was very friendly and had clear communication. Almost felt nothing when she took my blood. I don’t know why this place has a low rating. Maybe some people didn’t have an appointment and they had to wait a long time? I booked my appointment over the phone and it was easy, so I think you should definitely make an appointment.</Text>

This is a building problem. I visited this morning and found that the elevators were not operating. At my age, it was very difficult walking up and down 3 long fights of stairs. In addition, the parking gate was not operational. Others were having the same problem. It took 30 minutes to finally locate the maintenance man. He has to go out and physically operate the gate to allow me to exit!! By this time, there were other vehicles waiting to exit too.<//text>

<review>They get the needle out like it small blood vessels are damaged. Healthcare provider inserts the needle but while removing it , there wasn't enough pressure applied after the needle is removed. My daughter is suffering from pain in hand from last 1 week continuously and even I don't have any direct contact to Quest diagnostic to talk on this. Later I have to visit my Physician.</review><Gmap_id>0x80dce8edaa519229:0xe07fe1f35f1a86cb</Gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures>< user_id>

unbelieveable to navigate their appointment system.don't even try unless you are !00% computer literate.took me 15 minutes to make my appointment.would not let me put in my phone number several times.had to start all over each time.instead,call their phone number, and go through their automated system.the staff is excellent; however, i would go to another lab if it were more convenient.< /review>

Based on the reviews I read I was a little concerned about going to this office. My experience was great. I had made an appointment and got there early and they took me right away.
The phlebotomist Malu was great. Not only was she warm and attentive but she was so good I barely felt the stick.
I will definitely go back here.< /review>

I was unable to make an appointment at all and tried 3 times to do this.   Incredibly frustrating!!!!!!< /review>< response>

My mother and me always have a great experience at Quest Diagnostics, and love the service we get there.  You also never wait a long time and they take care of you, Which I appreciate, Katie P. Is always very Nice and Kind and does her best to take my mother's and my blood flawlessly and painlessly. It is a very nice place to get your blood taken and gets lab test. :) ❤< /Text>

<Review>This place sucks.  Why have a phone number if you can't speak to a person.  A phone that offers only recorded info is a fabulous way to tell your customers that you don't give a f$#) about them.  I am all about using the website but what I needed was not there and would take 5 seconds for a person to answer.<//Review>< Pics>

I had a 7:45am appointment. The Tech seemed like she was in a rush. I didn't catch her name but she had dark hair and was in the very last station. When it was time to take my blood, she prepped my arm. I usually turn away during the stick, so I wasn't looking, but after the initial pinch there was a sharp tingling pain that traveled the length of my arm. I immediately turned to look what happened and no blood was coming out. The tech had to pull it back and fish a little to find my vein. My gut is that she when thru my vein. I unfortunately had to leave right away because I was gonna be late for work, but I was able to call the office. I spoke with the supervisor named Kelsey. She apologized, and said that she would forward the information to the manager and they would follow up with me to see how I was doing. She said to call if I had any questions and explained some of the symptoms that I might get for a day or so. She mentioned that there is always a high risk that this will happen, but also stated that the tech should have known better. I did call on Monday to speak about my arm still tingling, and the person that answered the phone said that she would have the Manager call me about it. I received no call. I ended up going to my doctor and asking my questions there. My doctor was more than a little surprised that this happened. In their opinion, I apparently am an easy stick. She asked if the tech was a student, and I stated no. My doctor stated that this is a common mistake for students, but an experienced tech would not have done this. My doctor then informed me that my symptoms would be there for possibly a week. It is now FRIDAY. NO ONE has called me. NO ONE has followed up. I don't even know if my issue was even escalated to the Manager because when I originally asked for them on Monday the person that answered was hesitant to even let me talk to them. I told them what happened and she seemed very uninterested and unconcerned. I obviously don't need medical assistance any longer, since I have already gone to my doctor with my concerns. But, from the stand point of customer service, you should consider actually following thru with your patients. ESPECIALLY, when your technician was at fault.<//text>

<review>We received substandard customer service today at this location.  When requesting a note for my daughter's school to excuse her from missing her 7:00 a.m. class, we were told by the "Group Lead" that they "don't give those letters out."  This is the first time we have been told that.  This was our third visit to this location in 3 months for our daughter because she has a standing order.  When I told the "Group Lead" that we had gotten the forms from them as recently as one month ago he told me "whoever gave you that was not supposed to."  He was rude.  He was condescending.  His behavior was unacceptable.

At that point another employee came to our rescue.  She was pleasant and kind and told the "Group Lead" where to find the forms.  He told her that they were "not supposed to give them out."  She ignored his ridiculous refusals to help us and got the form for us.

A few questions:
Why does Quest have the forms, if they are "not supposed to give them out?"
What is a student supposed to do to get readmitted to school?
Why were we treated like we were trying to perpetrate some sort of fraud?  We were only trying to get the appropriate paperwork to get our daughter readmitted to school.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< name>

Have surgery coming up, went to get labs done. And the tech didn't even order them as stat as the order stated. Now getting a call that surgery might be cancelled due to an ignorant and naive error the tech made. He was a tall Hispanic guy, more interested in my day then obviously ordered my test right! And the waiting room was empty. So it's not like he was in a rush! I would advise go to lab Corp they order labs as ordered, wait is long but the job gets done right! DO NOT COME HERE. People life's for techs error.< /Text>

I am new to the area and I came to Quest because of the forms my doctor gave me. I could not make an appointment over the phone,  it was impossible with the automated system so I came by on a Saturday after 9:00am. The front person was rude as hell right from the start said " we are full you need yo make an appointment"  walked out found labcorp across the street and they were awesome!< /text>

< Review>
Everything has been great for me.

I've been to this office before and didn't have the bad experience conveyed by others. So I wanted to give them another chance.

Before I start, I'm not denying anyone else's experience and the bad reviews here. I'm just conveying my experience which happens to be different. Take that as you will.

But as to "no more walk-ins", that's completely incorrect. The phone line for Quest says "walk-ins are always welcome". I called for an appointment but it said the earliest available slot was in two days. I already fasted for a blood test so I just went in. There is a sign-in sheet for appointments and walk-ins. Hardly anyone was there (Wednesday AM). I got in with no problem.

I was told that on Saturdays they get a lot of people with appointments and the walk-ins fill up the rest of the schedule early in the morning. That's basic "first-come first-serve", and "overflow" can't be served. That's just a matter of basic resources - limits on personnel and time. So yes, it's possible that some people will get turned away if they see the schedule is completely filled.

As to wait time, it really depends on when you get there and pure luck. You can't call to find out how busy they are. A lot of people with appointments don't show up, but if they do then walk-ins need to wait behind them.

They do more than blood there, it's all body fluids, so wait time is not just dependent on whether you're getting a blood test or something else. If you really just need blood work, consider another an office that doesn't provide all of the other services too.

My personal experience today, Wednesday 9/28: I got in at 9:30AM, was called in at 9:40ish after they processed about 3 other people. The phlebotomist was done with me by 9:47. I had to give them urine and was out of the office by 9:55. I've had to wait longer in the past but I was still in and out within an hour. Working for myself I can get in while other people work 9-5 jobs. That's a huge factor which makes it more difficult for 9-5 workers and students but good for others like seniors.

As to quality and service. My contact was cordial and professional, efficient during the blood draw, conversational but not overly chatty. This was the best possible experience.

As a side note, there is a small street that goes around the parking lot and there is usually a space available, so it's free parking there if you can walk up a couple steps to get to the building. I don't know if they charge for parking in the lot but in my few visits I've never had to find out.

Everywhere we go we will find occasional delays and bad service, and we should report it in review places like this. But we should also balance the good experience reviews with the bad to see if a place has frequent problems or if there was just a bad day or two. Given my experiences which have been completely different from some others here, I'd say this place is fine with occasional common issues. For me a lot more bad reports would be needed for me to second-guess that impression.

I hope that helps others...</Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) Before and after the three men, three pumping, pumped up a little, not enough to blame the patient blood pumping too dry or cry. But old patient, not only did not cry, has endured quietly sobbing, really rubbish blood technician.

前后三个人，抽了三次，抽到了一点，抽不够怪病人血太干或是哭。病人不过几岁，不仅没有大哭，一直忍着小声啜泣，真是垃圾抽血技师。< /Text><UserId.>114307251784855447184</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<GmapID>0x808f77776137138f:0x904e891f086a37cf</GmapID><text>The manager Koko is AMAZING! Very enthusiastic, professional,welcoming demeanor, just a great energy to be around. Knows his craft. Has a lot of great juices, I'm VERY picky and liked a bunch of the ones I tried. I actually couldn't decide on which one to get cuz I liked so many, usually I barely like one, mystery pop, but la coast or something like that,mango, strawberry, n another flavor. Also, juices r fresh n mixed very well. As I learned, nicotine is usually clear, it turns dark after sitting awhile, so when is clear, it's fresh. Mine was clear 😁 and taste amazing!! I'll be back on payday!! He told me keep my juice n vap in temps under 70 degrees cuz it thickens the juice n burns the coil faster. Very Very informative! I've enjoyed my experiences at BOTH of his locations San Mateo and Millbrae. I highly recommend this man and his places of business!<//text></record></dataset><record>

Great service here and the employees are definitely well informed on most of your e-cig/vape needs. Been coming here for a long while now and it's always a friendly familiar face greeting me at the door. During the pandemic they've moved their counter to the door, not allowing customers inside yet they're helpful enough to help you get what you need regardless.< /Text>

<Review>These dudes are super chill. They will help out if you need something. Legit vape boutique. I was helped out and served like 5 flavors before I decided. They definitely took care of me. They could use more selection of flavors and mods but they pretty much seem to have the best of the best stuff there.</Review></record>

<time>1555203677571< /time><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Probably one of the most laid back, relaxing and helpful experiences I’ve ever had at a vape shop, and I just moved here from Portland and have been to plenty around there. These guys know their stuff, I was greeted at the door and he fixed my vape tank with no fuss, dude was really chill and to the point, and I appreciate that, everyone’s trying to find out who I am and blah blah, I like how this guy just fixed my issue, answered my questions, and sold me my juice like the professional business owner he is. Very friendly too. Thank you man, I work in town and I will be back!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>First time here and I had a great experience. Koko the owner answered all my questions. He make the experience enjoyable without any pressure. He helped my find the right vap mod and juice. He was very detailed on how to setup my system and how to care for it. I'll definitely will be back! I would recommend coming here if your looking to get off cigarettes or you just need to find a new place to get your vap needs.

Thanks again Koko for a great customer experience!<//text><user>111938465193654274447<//user></record></dataset><record>

<text>Very helpful friendly and just a great attitude from all of the staff. The owner Coco is there pretty much all the time and he makes you feel welcome and comfortable like you've been ftiends forvyears even if it's uour first time meeting him. The one thing that kept me from giving Millbrae Vape 5 stars is there juice selection which I've discussed with Coco (owner) and I know he has been working hard on it and that everyone that visits his store will be more than happy once the new juice menu is put in place.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I came in the shop, not knowing a thing about what I wanted or needed for a vape. A real vape mod this time. These guys guided me to my lil SnowWolf and I've been token no worries since then. Full of knowledge, ask them questions. Need guidance? Come in clueless, leave satisfied without doubt!<//text>

Park on the street, no parking available at the restaurant itself. Food was standard fast food, wide variety of options. Vibe worth trying. Next time would try the Mexican dishes or the chili and cheese on the hot dog.<//text>

I've had some of the best tacos there. By a accident I found this place which was just across a small street from my eye doctor. Had the chicken soft taco and  fries.
Ate in my car parked around the corner since I live in the valley. Excellent and I couldn't eat the whole taco and the fries were enormous. Loved the flavors of the tacos. Great service too.</text>

Just a great burger.  These guys have been working there for over 20 years and will remember your usual order after a few visits.  Get your car washed at Santa Palm car Wash next door while you are waiting.< /text>

Great new addition to Dogpatch & 3rd St. Interesting Latin American menu. Sliders - Ostrich, allegator & venison were very good. Nice ribs served with plantains and rice & beans on the side were excellent. The side of mashed plantains was a large, very interesting addition. No liquor license as yet. Will have to go back and try them for lunch.</text>

<text>I don't know if there is a day that goes by with my not thinking of the food from LA Buns. If you need a suggestion, try the chicken breast sandwich, and their fries are amazing. If you're adventurous, ask for a custom order...I love to ask them for a tuna-melt burrito with sourcraut...might sound odd, but believe me, It's delicious! I never get tired of it, and I aught to know...I used to eat from there everyday when I worked in the next block on the corner of Larrabee.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c2bea53e155f05:0xfa2d1a75d029e598< /GmapID></record>

The name might suggest that this is primarily a burger joint and way way back when, it was. These days they still have some great burgers and an amazing chicken club sandwich along with onion rings and French fries. They have also added an extensive Mexican food menu as well. These guys know how to make some great Mexican dishes quickly too. There is only outdoor seating here but that area is covered to keep the rain off of you on those rare days that it rains in Southern California. Wear a jacket if it is chilly outside though because you will not be indoors at any time here. There is a walk up window where you place your order and another window where you will pick up your order once it is ready. Nothing here is prepared in advance. Your order is freshly cooked once you place it but these guys have mastered the art of quickly preparing any of their menu items so you won't be waiting too long for your food. The small wait is very much worth it. These are freshly made dishes done quickly but done right. I highly recommend their fish tacos or chicken club sandwich. Their chili cheese fries with freshly diced onions is a meal in itself and is a wonderful hangover cure. I quite honestly have never had anything from their menu that I did not like. There are also enough different choices that there is going to be something that will make your mouth and stomach happy you stopped by.< /text>

It's a quick bite. A little hut in the corner of a carwash. They don't have parking, the seating is outdoors. I work near by, the guys are great and always friendly. The nachos are good.</review>

Although it took much longer than expected considering there were only me and one other customer when I ordered I must say my burger was delicious and the fries were the best I've had ever!</review>

The food here is absolutely amazing. They have the best Burgers, the best Mexican Food, and an amazing Chicken Club Sandwich that I strongly suggest everyone try.  The dining area is open to the outdoors, so not a good place to sit when its chilly....but other than that, its an amazing place for some quick, and simple munchies.</Text>

Its really not that cheap... its only cheap cause they sell everything separately... and when you buy everything it comes out to be as much as you would spend at shake shack or fat burger or any of those other burger joint.</Text>

<text>I ordered a carne asada taco and a pastor taco. The pastor taco was very bland. The asada taco was also bland and tough to chew. The menu doesn't say and the guy taking the order doesn't tell you but they automatically put onions, cilantro and tomato on the taco. I had to pick out the tomatoe.</text>< pics>

Thank you Kelly for your amazing help. My sister and I are still figuring things out ourselves as we are first time dog owners of a 4 month old puppy. We went in and were amazed by the excellent customer service Kelly assisted us with. She was super helpful with giving us advice and suggestions of what are good recommendations when it comes to raising and caring for a puppy fully growing every day over time.< /review>

<text>Best dog (and cat) store in all of North County. Dexter's has the best selection of pet food I could possibly imagine but most importantly the staff is so helpful and kind and they will assist you with anything you might need. They always give me free samples and my dog has loved them every single time. Highly recommended!!</text>< pictures>

Quality Pet Stuff with a Local Touch.

Dexter's is a great little pet store in Del Mar village.  Our dogs love to visit because they always get treats. We are happy because of the quality of the treats and ingredients.

Dexter's also features a well-curated selection of accessories. Out pip liked to chew her leash, in excitement before our walks. After going through three leashes from a large, commercial chain, we picked up a leash at Dexter's.  Much softer to the hand and it shows no sign of tooth wear.

If your in Del Mar with a pet, check it out!< /text>

I love the variety of high quality treats for my clients, the Cats amd Dogs. Choosy Pet parents will find a variety of what isn't available anywhere else in town. The staff is very well informed and so welcoming, too. I highly recommend a visit if you have been. Best healthy pet food in town!<//Review>

Consistently great, friendly service. Our dogs absolutely love everything I’ve bought from there. They also have veggie “pig” ears which is pretty cool (and the dogs seem to love them just as much as the beef ones)!</text>

They sell everything you'd need for your little or big furry friends. Their prices are affordable and aside from that, you can even have fun shopping whilst having your cat or toy dog leisurely having a ride on your shopping cart.</text>

Guy who runs the place is really nice and seems knowledgeable.  He sold me a cat toy that my cat absolutely goes ape sh*t over.  Loves it.  He also special ordered a love glove for my cat.  Don't judge.</Text>

Dexter's Deli is a real nice pet shop.  Small, but full of goodies. Looking for raw food for your canine/feline, Dexter's is the place to be.

Our dog loves browsing - shopping there.  Staff is real nice & super helpful.< /Review>

<date>1560619602328< /date><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Just lost a coustomer who has been with them for 5 years over one bag of dog food. "I got a bad batch" and they wanted me to ship it back at my expense. I asked if I would be credited the money, they said no. Sent me a replacement bag at no charge but again I already paid for shipping plus the cost of the bad bag in the first place. Then I was sent a text saying basically we don't want your business any more due to this issue and its to difficult to ship one bag of dog food, a few toys and treats. I guess that's what I get for supporting a local business for 5 years and not amazon which they referred me to.</Review>< pics>

<Text>Dexters sell the highest quality cat and dog food. Plus I have learned so much by asking the staff questions about specific foods and  ingredients. Every staff member knows all about each product and can answer questions about them. They offer free samples and have wonderful handouts on everything from feeding, behavior, fleas, you name it. I love shopping locally and supporting this wonderful business.</Text>< Response>

Adorable little specialty pet store! Super clean, pet friendly, and every dog the customers bring in are so well-behaved. High quality brands with simple ingredient lists, affordable compared to other specialty pet stores and online, and their raw food variety actually blows my mind. Or rather, the variety they've squeezed into the little store does.

Dog Food:
• Amazing variety of dog food, ranging from raw, freeze-dried, wet and dry.
• Probably most known for their raw food.

Treats:
• Usual pet store stuff like raw hide, bully sticks, dental chews, those popular Himalayan yak milk chews, fish skins, etc.
• Doggy bakery goods and yogurts
• Lots of freeze dried treats!

Supplements:
• There is literally something for every doggy problem that occurs. Ranges from OTC dog medications to homeopathic/herbal.

Toys:
• Smaller section that their food, but my God... they've selected at least a couple toys in every category of a dogs fetish...
° stuffingless, crinkle, squeek, plush, rubber, heavy chewers, thrashers, rope toys.. even replacement squeekers
• Personal favorite: their self-branded red squeeky ball

Service:
• The best. Extremely welcoming, helpful, knowledgeable and listens to every customer and their dogs.
• They personally know everyone (and dog), and they always have treats and samples, which they're very generous with.

Everything I've bought here made me feel like it was worth every penny. They also have a loyalty program where you get $1 off every $25 you spend.</Text>

I was devastated and about to cry in front of this shop when they closed the shop at 6pm on Saturday and I arrived 2 minutes late. I know what you are wondering, why did I give this place 5 star? Full story unrolling below....

Our baby was turning 1 and we invited his 4 legged buddies. The party is at 7pm and we were desperate for a good dog cake and our friends suggested Dexters Deli to us. I was in Rancho Bernardo and called and placed a order for the cake at 5:30pm and the shop was about to close at 6pm. So I requested to wait extra 5 minutes and they said they would keep separate my cake and wait for me to come

Looks like there was lack of communication and the one who closes the shop, Christine did not get any memo from whom I talked on the  phone.

So I reached the shop at 6:02pm and saw the shop closed. I was devastated and about to cry in front of this shop. I knocked the door few times and Chritine showed up and she did  close the counter and cannot do any business,  and I explained the situation.

Christine was closing the shop for the first time, still, she understood the situation and gave preference to the customer and gave me the cake free, yes FREE. I insisted on taking the cash,  but she denied. Even though it was her first time, she handled the situation very well.  I am sure I will recommend this place to all my  4 legged parents as I will come there soon.

CAKE: cake was yummy, pictures are the proof</text>

<Review>Don't be fooled by the name. ;) This is not a place to get your sandwiches. ;)
I first heard about this place when I was looking online for places that sold PrimalFoods (my dog's brand choice for dog food) close to my home in UTC.

Now, this is my pup's only grocery store. All of her meals and treats are purchased here.

FREQUENT BUYER CARD: This is the only store I know that sells the high-quality dog food along with other holistic/organic treats. There's also a WholeFoods down the street from me which is a lot closer that sells my dog's food, but Dexter's Deli's frequent buyer card program makes me come back here because I know I'll be saving money in the long run. It allows me to accumulate dollars with each purchase I make, and so when I have enough for a free bag of Primal Foods, I use it. ;) For Primal Foods, there's even a frequent buyer card for that that they've started just recently. So I'm saving a lot more!

STAFF:  The staff is very friendly and knows their products very well. A lot of repeat customers seem to walk in the store a lot, and the staff knows some of these people (and dogs!) by name. ;) Very nice to keep it all personal like that.

PARKING/LOCATION: If you are coming here for the first time, you might want to drive slow along Camino Del Mar because it can be easily missed. See some of the pictures here to get an idea of how the awning sign looks like. GPS can help, but even with GPS, I was close to missing it, and had to immediately pull in to the parking lot because I almost saw the sign too late. ;) Parking can be kinda tricky. The parking lot is small. There's probably only about 6 or 7 available parking spots to choose from, but some may or may not already be taken. It just depends what time of day you go. Pulling out from the parking lot can be a challenge if there are cars parked on the street. ;)

PRODUCTS: They sell healthy versions of all foods (for cats and dogs) dry and wet, (none of the commercial foods like Purina or Science Diet). They have really good treats (at least according to my dog they do), antler bones.... A section for grooming products (even the coveted Blueberry Facial wash!) cat toys, pet beds, pet clothes, socks, doggles, a whole shelf dedicated to dog toys, a small fresh bakery section (selling birthday cakes, cupcakes, etc), puzzle toys, dog music, leashes, collars, strollers, and other dog supplies.

ATMOSPHERE: A very "Del Mar" boutique vibe all throughout the store. Very friendly and laid-back. I have yet to bring my dog to this store, and then take a lazy stroll along Camino Del Mar. :) A lot of people during the weekends walking or biking along Camino Del Mar, and some even passing through here just to look around.<//Review>< Pics>

Dexter's lost us as customers of 10+ years today when they said they wouldn't honor old receipts to redeem for points my mom found last week that had been lost in a box in our attic since 2012. The total amount that the points would have translated to is nothing compared to the amount they are losing in our business. I'm very disappointed.</review>

<review>Nice people, good delivery rates... And okay variety to choose from... Website was a little hard to navigate at first, and I assume the fire symbols are hot product (rating)..
And I'm not too familiar with edibles , Therefore I was a little confused on the milligrams in the gummies or dosage amount, whether or not it had CBD oil in it or if it was just thc.

Over all 4 or 5 stars in my book. Quick easy and simple<//review><name>Kayla Williams</name></record>

They lied and admitted to the fact after I had purchased it . Nothing about this was purple gelato at all .

They will sell you green house or outdoor for indoor price so not be fooled</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I have been most pleased with this service! The Chat Technician, the Budtenders, and the delivery drivers are Exceptional! They are informative, professional,
helpful, trustworthy, and very friendly. I felt like part of the family my very first order. I highly recommend their products and Valley Patients Collective!< /Text>

Last two times I have ordered my deliveries are 2-4 hours after their eta. And they don’t try and fix their screw up. Waited two hours to be told oh 30-45 min driver is behind TWICE and then waited another 2 hours for her to not even give me a explanation or trying to fix a unhappy customer. Don’t think I’ll be giving them another chance.<//review>

Just started using this place. Everyone is super friendly, and helpful. No issues with getting my deliveries so far. Candy edibles, cartridge for my pen, and also the buds have all been worth it! Definitely recommend this place if your in their delivery area.<//review>

I love this place. I was having a hard time finding a delivery service that delivers to my town. I was so happy to find this place only 15 mins from me. Staff was very nice and prompt. Delivery was also quick and easy. We will deff continue to use this service. Thank you Valley Patients !! 💜💜<//text>

Update: I just purchased two rove brand carts and tried to scan the qr code on the app for my rove reward, at which point rove told me it was potentially counterfeit and to not use it and to contact the manufacturer.... what’s that about? Now I’m afraid to use them...... 😳😳😳😳 still amazing staff though.

$35 for a half gram and up to $70 for flower? That’s getting way too expensive. Didn’t mind the $60 for the flower but it seems every time I go on to get something the prices have gone up again. I can’t afford those prices. I’d be willing to pay the $60 for flower And maybe $30 for the half gram carts, but I can’t justify $70 for flower or $35 for a half gram cart. I love the service thgh, they’re great people and they’re just trying to make a living but sadly I won’t be able to afford to continue purchasing from them at these prices. I can still do the $50 gram carts but it won’t be long before they go up also at this rate. I’m very sad that I’ll have to stop using them. 🥺 I still can’t stress enough that the staff is amazing. I just really enjoy several of the half gram carts you have but can’t justify $35 when I can get a full gram for $50. I get that the more you buy the better the deal but I would think buying 2 of the half grams should be $50 not $70. But still, AMAZING STAFF.<//Text>< pictures>

We’re all upset, if only we could grow all these strains our self but that just isn’t currently possible. The prices are going up to justify the cost of drivers, gas, dispatchers and administrative expenses. We have now brought on outdoor from time to time to make affordable 1/8th available to everyone.

<review>I am one of the hardest women to please, yet VP comes through every single time. Hands down the best delivery service this side of Sac and I won’t go anywhere else. They go out of their way, even after hours, to bring me what I need because their customers are important. Never over charging or adding “tax” to increase profits.  Just don’t try the other guys until you try the best. Valley Patients. Make sure to tip their drivers for not bringing dabs turned upside down, melted or nasty, too. It’s a team effort and it shows. ✌🏻< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

The New growers INCREASING PRICES to the  stores/dispensaries is bringing back the Black Market Growers im seeing that growers all over the area are back in business. Growers haven't seen these kind of prices I'm seeing in over 30 years and actually I've never even heard of an 1\8 going for $65 & $70 unless you just had really bad connections. Legalization dropped the price but then the GREED from the new growers set in and prices are ridiculous to the stores now which gets passed on to the consumers us which is obviously not Valley collectives fault it's the new suppliers and their greed and we're the ones paying for all the Investments they had to make in order to grow not there overhead.

I just started using Valley Patient and their terrific. See I’m old school and it’s still amazes me we can now enjoy our herbs and it’s legal. I’ll encourage all my  friends and family to use Valley Patient their products are awesome top shelf. Try the smashed gummies their heavenly with a little spicy kick in the end. Hats off to you Valley Patient< /Text>

I just love this place. Very good products and excellent employee s. Try this place out and see for yourself. But the only thing i dont like is their prices go up and down.  Ypu buy something for 55 thr the next 45.   I believe the jack up the prices. And somenof the dont do anything to you.<//review>

One of my favorite places to dine! The authentic Colombian cuisine reminds me of my own abuelita's cooking. The food is fresh and always tasty. Service can be a little slow when it's busy, but they are always kind and helpful. The food in itself earns this place 5 stars for me. Would recommend time and time again.</review>

Came here on a Friday night with my guy and we we're seated right away.  Quiet little spot tucked away in a shopping center. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and attentive. The sangria messed me up-very tasty and the food was FANTASTIC. 100% authentic Columbian fare-best I've had since leaving my hometown in NYC.  If I could just find a good slice of pizza around here I'd be all set.<//text>

The food here is delicious and the atmosphere is fun. It can get a little loud with the live music and service can be slow, especially if you come with a big group. The food is worth the wait though!</Text>

Best Colombian food I've had in Orange County. Bandeja Paisa is amazing every time! Also, the aborrajado is great for a dessert!
Besides the food, the service is always very good. Everyone is friendly and attentive. I'll definitely keep coming back.</Review>

FOODV It's absolutely DELICIOUS, but a bit XPENSIVE. It could or should be less xpensive for the amount of food you get, even though it's delicious and very typically oriented. Right on. People are very nice and friendly. LIVE Music is FANTASTIC!!!...I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT😄< /Review>

Authentic Colombian food. Plates are really big and delicious and it's a very good value. Service is good as well. Bandeja paisa is a must but they also serve a wide variety of their local comfort food, typical dishes as well as arepas. The vibe is a normal casual restaurant. They sometimes have live music on weekends!
Definitely worth trying!</Text>

Great Colombian food, some of rhe best I have tasted in the US.  "Arepas de chocolo" and the "cazuela" were great choices.  Dessert was very difficult to pick (to many great options) but both the "postre de natas" and "brevas con arequipe" let us thinking in the next time we will come back.<//text>

Service is extremely slow. I had to wait for 50 minutes to get the food served and taste was just average.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) I love this place, it is far from home but I stick the trip to be able to enjoy good Colombian food with good seasoning. My favorite is the seafood casserole, the fried mojarra, the rice with chicken, in short everything I have tried is delicious!

Wonderful food, staff, hookah and ambience. Almost anything you want is available at the bar or on tap. And I don't even know the owners or employees... it's just a good business run well, which is refreshingly uncommon.

Important PS - - There was a recent change in ownership, so older reviews may not be reliable; actually, I heard the old place was a hell hole.< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>Me and my friend went there to eat fish because they try to attract people with their Tuesday promotion of buy one fish get one free , but the trick is they sell you expired food which should not be served because it smells very bad , taste horrible, and it's dangerous for health and can cause food poisoning, so they put the first fish on my table and the smell was unbelievably bad , it did smell like a dead animal which has been left under sun light for ages , and there were 3 guys sitting on the table right next to me who told me hey your fish smells really bad be careful don't eat it , so I called the guy who cooked the fish to smell it and he pretend it's normal and I asked him to remove that fish from my table , he brought me the second fish which was less smelling but when i had the first bite it was really the worst taste I've ever had so i left the place right away hopping that one bite i had doesn't make me end up in an emergency room .. i just want to tell the owner of that horrible place it's not ethical, not humanitarian,and very illegal what you are doing and how you are trying to make your money and an action has to be taken to stop you putting the health of others under risk< /review><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80d950e49fcf07a7:0x931212d7b46676b9<//gmap_id>< Pics>

We drive about 20 mins to get takeout from here. Fresh ingredients and really tasty! Been here 4 times since first discovering it on thanksgiving eve. The place we usually go to had a 90 min wait, so I gave Amy’s a try. The flavors we’re so much better than most Chinese I have tried in Sonoma County, and it’s always ready between 15-20 mins. Very fairly priced. It not a fancy place, but tastes great! Would recommend</text>

I called in an order for delivery while i wasn’t at home. The kids called me an hour and a half later to say their food hadn’t been delivered. So I rush home to find half our order delivered. Called to complain and I am told off by whomever and was told even essential workers make mistakes. Essential? Not even close! Got five of the six meals I ordered and a refund.< /Text>

<GmapID>0x80844a7bfaaf186d:0xf4a5b689213cb542<//GmapID><Text>Amy's Chinese Kitchen in Cotati "delivers" again! Christmas day and not wanting to cook I ordered online for pick-up only, understandably. BBQ pork egg foo young, chicken chow mein and deep fried prawns. The chicken chow mein was delicious. So was the BBQ pork egg foo young. I do wish I had ordered the sauce on the side because I ended up eating it later, but that's on me, not Amy's. I keep saying I want to try all the appetizers, but keep going back to the fried prawns, because when you're craving something hot and crispy, that's what you've got to get. In the special instructions I asked for hot mustard. There's enough for all the leftovers! At my work we order from that express place a lot because it's close by, but never, not once have they included the hot mustard I've requested...so there's that to consider< /Text>< Time>

Not happy with the sales techniques, oh enough for 2 people really means 4.    $ 87.50 later it was so so. Not worth $87.50! Thank you Amy we will find a more honest restaurant. Guy knew he up sold me and if the food was really good I wouldn't be posting this. Do yourself a favor and order from their competitors.<//Text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>This place is the BEST! I have lived in SoCo for 45 years. In all that time I have found one Chinese restaurant that was good. In 45 years. Unfortunately the good one is way up in Bennett Valley. Not a fun drive. I found Amy's quite by accident. What a great surprise. Real authentic chinese. Not like Panda. Fresh. Large portions. Delicious. I love it. We go every couple of weeks and they never fail to put some crab puffs or some little nibble in. Gratis. Rice's are reasonable for what you get. I've never eaten inside because right when I found them, the pandemic hit. Pretty sure that was just a coincidence. Ha ha. Bad joke. Anyway I called a week or so after Shelter IN Place began and to my delight they were doing take out. The ordering on line was a bit confusing. I think that is fixed but I always call just to be certain. 5 stars!< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Me being half Asian, makes me really appreciate this place. I love their combination fried rice. No carrots,  no peas like in the usual commercial c huh inese food restaurants; just fried rice, shallots, eggs and tons of char siew, chicken, beef and shrimp.  Their wonton soup is also very tasty, especially nowadays thet is kinda chilly.</Review>< userid>

Great food. The owners remember you and greet you warmly with big smiles.
They always throw in a little something in extra. They do a big take out business also.  This is our #1 Chinese restaurant.</Text>

The restaurant is clean. Staff is friendly. Good food!! It's too bad that they're so hidden. They're food and service is 10 times better than the Chinese restaurant up the street on old redwood hwy!!  Amy's is worth checking out. They have lunch specials with a wide variety of dishes. Dinner specials. They even modify any hot and spicy dish to your taste.</Review>

Without a doubt the best Chinese food within a 100 mile radius. This tiny place is unassuming, but every dish I've tried has been absolutely amazing. If I lived in San Francisco, I'd still drive up to this place to eat. Absolutely unbelievable.</Text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Remarkably great Chinese cuisine, not just food.  Very fresh ingredients,clean-tasting sauces. Innovative use of shitaki and other mushrooms; delicious eggplant and tofu dishes; top quality chicken and beef, excellent vegetables such as green peppers, crisp bok choy, carrots, snow peas. Vegetarian egg rolls, sizzling rice soup, not greasy in any way. Great friendly enthusiastic and disciplined service from host Michael. Courteous takeout and prompt delivery. Surprising that such excellent food comes from this very clean but very plain space in a small strip mall; don't let the plain appearance fool you. Overlook the plain environment and location and focus on the food and you will have a fine dining experience. Amy's is my favorite over several "fine" Thai and Japanese restaurants in Sonoma County. Amy's isn't fancy, it's just plain good! If you're in the area, check it out!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

After living in Sonoma County for almost thirteen years I had given up hope of finding anything as good as what we get in San Francisco. I was thrilled to discover this gem right in my little town.

The food is prepard well, just the right amount of seasoning and each dish tastes just like it is supposed to rather than as if all the sauces came from the same bottle labeld "random brown sauce". The prices were very reasonable and the portions for take out were very generous.

Our order consisted of;
Ginger Beef; Perfect! Plenty of ginger, just delicious.
Combo Chow mein; loads of meat and vegies and just the right amount of sauce.
Mu Shu pork; The best I've had in years.
Braised Tofu with vegetables;I would have preferred it if the tofu was crispier, but it came with loads of vegetables.)

Amy's is officially my go to restaurant for chinese food.<//Text>

<time>1492385695196< /time><Rate>2<//Rate><Text>Ordered delivery. Said 30 minutes it was 45. Not a big deal. Spent $42. $11 of which was a large wonton soup. Each has about 5-6 wontons and a less than tastey broth. Unfortunately. I ordered a spicy chicken and broccoli and it isn't spicy. No chili oil to compensate. Free fried wontons. Was actually cold on arrival. This was Easter Sunday at around 3pm. It was raining. So maybe something went wrong today but Im not ordering here again.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

When I couldn’t find my phone Randy help me by calling the phone number and seeing if it would ring in the car. It didn’t but he was so confident and impressed me so much with his willingness to help and his compassion for caring about my predicament and how all of us feel when we can find our phones. I think Randy is a great asset to your business and I was so glad to cross paths with him.

Convenient local car wash site. They offer a few car wash options with different rates. Recommend the monthly fee which will save you plenty of money. Because it's new, you have a new site with vaccums, blowers, brushes and stalls. Let's see if the service and the upkeep lasts over time. Recommend it!<//review>

One of the best car wash experiences I’ve ever had. The staff was so friendly and helpful. I’ve been to a few other Waterdrops locations and they never fail to amaze me. I DEFINITELY recommend to everyone and anyone.<//Text>

We met the lady, which was really nice, and she pointed us towards the wash entry. Don't let me forget how much fun it was, they have lights and all types of stuff. It cleaned the car beautifully 😍.  I'd definitely recommend to At least try it out. Thank you. Also there is a buffer at the end that gets rid of streaks.<//review>< pictures>

Not impressed. Paid for the most expensive and hood buffer at the end didn't come down. Then the "spot free rinse" didn't fully rinse and yes, ton of spots! Then the dryer was so quick it didn't dry much to the point we had to pull into their vacuum area and fully wipe down from the excess water and the already mentioned non "spot free rinse". Sure all the lights and colorful wax is pretty but something needs to happen to change these issues.<//Review>

< Review>
Nice having 2 locations close the rose one gets super packed this one is new and empty I was wondering how they were going to make it work but it does wraps around , you turn left go straight back then wraps around to some that come out and she scanned my monthly and moved the cones and I was off ....car was really clean 👍 only issue was someone came out to guide me in the tracks I was like no one here I figured the lady who scanned me would walk back out again someone else came from other side and sometimes they are confusing when guiding you in 🤷😂</Review>

Went for a car wash kind of don't like how is by dirt field and plus you're in a box went to go buy an air freshener the air freshener where's $3 too expensive for a car wash in my opinion< /text>
<resp>{'time': 1621628214045, 'text': 'Air freshener comes for free on our top two packages. The dirt field you describe is undeveloped land near our brand new state of the art property. Sorry you feel that way. Please go down the street to the other car washes and see what you get for that price...'}< /resp>< name>

Staff was friendly, and helped me through this car wash.  Car came out quite clean.

<review>(Translated by Google) The best only need to train the staff more since I have membership and they told me that I was not active, I lost 10 minutes and they wanted to remove me from the line, but then a young woman checked my membership online and everything was fine, the system did not work and the young woman He did not know. Train more staff and have more patients with customers who do not want to remove them from the line. When I left vacuuming my car I was driving towards the exit and a worker of a 4-door lexus entered wronway and almost crashed my car !!! Help please

I was doing some pre-prom shopping, I went in the back and looked for a jacket, 50% off, found some pants, 70$ usually, on sale for 37$. Happy with these savings I went to the counter. When I got there, a manger gave me ANOTHER coupon and I got 40% of my total purchase. I only paid a third of my total cost!! I wore the suit to prom and Several events after. This store has good items for great deals.</review>

This stores seems to be blowing out merchandise (from other stores?),, using sales which are great cost savings. If you like their products, buy now. While I was shopping, sales prices were changed 2 times, by different clerks. For example buy 1 get 1 for 9.99. then buy 1 get 1. Then just "sale". Very packed with merchandise.</text>

I love JC Penney, but this store is so small and overcrowded that it's hard to find anything, and there's no order to the arranging of items.
I want to support them so they don't close, but it's not easy</review>

So I order some items online and do the whole Curbside pickup thing. Tell me why they have this service. I waited a good 15-20 min and nothing. I had to go inside and let someone know I was her for a curbside pickup. I am sorry it defeats the purpose. Why offer it. Very disappointed.<//text>

<Review>I have been shopping here for almost 30 years.  I lived in Temecula for 20 years and when they built the Temecula Mall in 2000 I was so thrilled they had a J.C. Penney store.  Previously I lived in Oceanside and would shop at Penneys at North County Mall.  Bought all my childrens clothes there and my own.  Been living in Hemet almost 2 years now but only just checked out the mall here a few days ago.  Was happy to see a JC Penney.  I just love this store.</Review>< Pics>

Lines are still very long. Selection of merchandise is good and the friendliness and helpfulness of the associates is very good.

It appears that there is still a minimum staffing issue that appears to be a company wide opportunity.

Overall the price point and value is much better in my opinion then its close competition. Definitely the customer service part of the experience is greater then that of most of it's competitors.<//text>

Went to pick up my online order online and albeit they have a section marked for online order pick up, that's not where you go. They have you go to a regular cashier and then they ask for your order email, app scan code or phone number. A bit of a bummer as there was a line with only one cashier. I will give them the benefit of the doubt since they are probably under staffed due to COVID-19. Once I got to the cashier, she was very friendly and assisted me quickly.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

It was terrible!  Not enough help on the floors, or at the registers! After waiting with my 93 year old grandmother for 15 minutes,  I went to another line, and then waited another 10 min.!!! Unacceptable!  We will not be back for a long time! Will do our shopping elsewhere!  Will put our J.C. PENNY'S card away!< /text>

I like shopping at Penny's.  Had a fairly long wait at the jewelry counter, today, so I went to Sears and did some shopping.
Seemed like a lack of  enthusiasm in JC Penney during this visit.<//text>

You can usually find pretty good deals on all the name brand clothes like Nike, Adidas, Dickies, Levi's, etc. For bargain hunters they usually have a good amount of clothes on clearance for fairly cheap. I one bought $140 worth of clothes for $35. Also it is a nice place to bring your little as mine loves to run around all the clothes. It really makes him happy and that makes me happy. The staff is always helpful and informative.</Text>

This location is quite disorganized. Although I DID find what I was looking for, I didn't feel comfortable enough to shop for more items. It feels cluttered and messy. Not very inviting. However, the cashier was very friendly and sociable, which I can appreciate.<//review>

JCPenney's has a great selection on a lot of clothes with reduced pricing.  I found some good t-shirts and shorts for the summer. Also their customer service is great. One of the cashiers was able to give me 10% or my purchase. There's plenty of parking as well.</text>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>Very unorganized, they have discount signs in the wrong places, they make you think you are getting a deal,  you get to find out the real price when you are at the cashier. Told manager about their prices being confusing and the clothes having the discount signs on them, she didn’t honor the discount, even though it was a lot of shirts of the same style with the discount on top of them.. manager Told us there’s nothing really she can do, that we are supposed to read the small print, and they go based on what the small print said, short sleeves, and all shirts were long sleeve. they had the sign up on the wrong shirts!!!!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

JCPenneys is alot like Sears, but more oriented in clothing. Still a great place to look for new styles with sales popping up every now and then. A solid store in general.</review>

<review>Great JCPenney that is smaller than average. They still have a decent selection of cloths I find and probably most mellianials stylish. I shop here only when things are on sale and my wardrobe looks much better because of it. 4 stars only because it is a smaller store size.<//review>< Pics>

I spoke to a manager a month ago about the dressing room smelling like urine. It has been smelling that way forever. He assured me he would have it cleaned. It still smells like urine. And the floor is filthy in the dressing room. Every time I go there they have new employees. I never see the same employee.< /review>

Smaller than average store but it was neat and organized. Clerks and cashier's we're friendly and helpful. Sales are great. Only complaint is the store is cramped and claustrophobic because there's a giant Saphora right in the middle that's literally  a building inside a building.< /text>

<Review>I went there with my wife on Monday March 19th to look at some clothes. The place is a mess, they are remodeling I guess  inside. And they just pushed the racks with clothes around. You have no access to the clothes. They just threw some plastic on top. Besides the place was dirty before. A bunch of old/out of the style clothing. They should have close the place while remodeling. But I guess they still want to make money even if it is  inconvenience for customers. Bad management I guess.
Bad experience.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I like this store as the clothing is cute and fairly priced and you can get a good variety of brands and discounts.   My only complaint is the people who shop there can trash the store and it's sad for the employees who have to clean up the huge messes< /review>

The store has taken out a large chunk to make room for Sephora.  Hey, there are some of us who used to buy our clothes here.  The selection is very sparse.  It has always been a small store and now I can’t find many reasons to come here.  It has gone down the tubes.</Review>

I went in looking to purchase a new suit. I was able to get help from a salesperson that was very knowledgeable about men's fashion which I appreciated. I'm not sure what problems the reviewer that was trying to buy shorts had but I always receive excellent service here.</text>

<Text>This JCPENNEY is not up to date on clothing in colors & design! To much of one design , not enough of spring wear. MOSTLY the AISLES ARE NOT SUPPORTIVE TO HANDICAP, WHEELCHAIRS, & BABY CARTS. NO CARTS EITHER AVAIL! NOT GOOD WITHOUT CARTS! NO INCENTIVE TO SHOP & PURCHASE VOLUME CARRY MERCHANDISE IN YOUR ARMS! POSSIBLE CHANGE IN THE MERCHANDISING PERSONNEL ? BEEN TO LONG COMPLAINTING TO THE STAFF X 4 YEARS. WAS GUARANTEED THESE PROBLEMS WOULD BE RESOLVED. STILL NOT DONE! TIRED OF DRIVING TO TEMECULA CA. THANK U! HOPE OTHERS WILL BE BOLD ENOUGH TO CHANGE HEMET JCPENNEY TO ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO SHOP IN OUR CITY.. THANK U, GOD BLESS. I CARE FOR ALL PEOPLE, YOUNG/OLD. LOVE TO ALL. THE STAFF MOSTLY R PLEASANT.BUT HARD TO FIND FOR HELP IN FLOOR..<//Text>< gmapID>

<Review>No wonder I go outside of hemet. Clothes all over the place. Noone available to get help. Cashiers always taking thier time. Registers cluttered
Just not a good atmoshpere.

JCPenney was the first place I ever worked out they've always had great value for the price I've tried shopping at other locations and just always go back to JCPenney. I've shopped at other locations and paid twice the prices much for the same item and just wasn't worth.< /review>

<Review>They were finishing inventory & the place was a mess. While the staff were friendly & helpful, it's hard to shop in such chaos. I picked up my catalog order & left.< /Review>< Rate>

The only reason for 2 stars instead of one, is that the staff were as helpful as they could be.  This Hemet store is an absolute mess, clothes are piled everywhere even on the floor!! Normally I love shopping at JCP but I won't be back to this one.<//text>

Trashy looking not organized at all. Every time go there never have what I want in the size I need. Clothing racks to close together so there is not room to squeeze between. Even worse once Zepoura went inside there.< /text>

<review>Went in to purchase a Suit for a meeting and some shirts, the staff were unhelpful and then tried to overcharge compared to the prices on the rack.  Worse still I had to show the staff the 'offers' on the rack and the shirts I bought were smaller than the tags on them and they wouldn't refund or exchange because one of the shirts had been 'worn' when I tried it on before I realized that the size was for a midget rather than a Normal sized man, they even admitted the shirts had been mistagged but 'their hands were tied due to me trying one on' I won't go back.</review><Time>1480648331291<//Time></record>

The associates were great but the store is cluttered. Stuff on top of stuff. Ridiculous to shop that way. Have to pick up clothes to shop what was underneath whole store was bad. Wont shop at that store again.<//text>

Use to shop at this Penney's, but now drive to Temecula.  This store is filthy!  Dressing rooms are the worst. It seems like the store is too small, but they still try to CRAM too much in and it ends up in piles on tables and on floors.<//review>

I was told to never return to this store again by the snooty and judgmental salesclerk who did not like the fact that I wanted to try on clothing from the young men's dept., and questioned me about my reason for doing so. My every move was also followed so closely I could smell the saleswoman's bad breath,  cilantro and sushi, eckk. Hey, I happen to like long shorts with cargo pockets. What's the big issue here? I was treated like a black person in the south during the segregation era. Shame on you JC Penney.< /Text>

One of the smaller JCPenneys but had what I was looking for. Store was clean overall but there were a few clothing items on the floor. This is more of a problem with thoughtless customers. It's in the Hemet Mall which recently had a remodel and that really helped the experience of shopping there.<//text>

This place is a joke!!!!! Unorganized store!!!!! The employees just walk around and don't seem to help anybody. The check out lines are long and it takes 30 min to check out 1 person!!! The store looks like a discount store!!<//Text>
