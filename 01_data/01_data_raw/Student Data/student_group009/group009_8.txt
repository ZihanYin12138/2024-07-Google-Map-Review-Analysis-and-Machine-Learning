Nice place to boondock. You have to bring what ever you need and take it back out. RV must be self-contained. Hot spring across the road from the camp is beautiful. Hiked around the area a bit. Irrigation on one side of the canal to grow carrots and desert on the other side of the canal. Friendly neighbors. Lots of bike riders.</Text>

<Date>1621028371400< /Date><rating>2< /rating><review>Not as great as it used to be. Dont know who did it but the place has been vandalized, the waterspout that was used to control the temperature is no longer there and now the water is permanently at a swealtering mid ground between 110° - 115° degrees with the way it feels. Also the upkeep is terrible since the fire happened. Last visit the moss was out of control, there was ash still in the water, and moss is growing over the concrete now probably due to the "new water spout" which is a literal rock blocking the outflow of water. The faucet on the other end is also broken too.

Whoever ruined this spot I hope your happy, because you up and made this once amazing rest stop a shadow of what it used to be. It breaks my heart knowing that some people are willing to go out of their way to make everyone else's life as miserable as theirs.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

One of the best camping experiences of my life. Nobody bothered us, the hot springs were fantastic, and being out there in the desert felt like we were on the moon. We had the whole place to ourselves and it felt great. Keep your campfires low, because the surrounding brush can get very dry.<//text>

Be careful at night. The water is good and hot and cool oasis..its a 5 star shower... but the border patrol cop at night came and harassed so 1 star because this has happened twice. This is 8 miles from the US border so be careful.</text>

A little too hot for me, but otherwise a great place that I would come back to.  If there was a second pool or some way to not instantly boil then I'd give it 5 star.< /Review>

Well the first few nights I was there it was nice ... went to the hot tub in the evenings... then people came into the pools and we're smoking cigarettes... I said to the one local gentleman would you mind not smoking... he was blowing it in my face and told me to suck it up... then there was a guy there hacking and coughing and spitting it on the ground where everyone walked... then a little while later there was a guy blowing his nose onto the ground where you walked honestly people are so inconsiderate.... I went there to relax and I wanted to feel like I was doing something for my body by soaking in the mineral water ...well it was sort of counterproductive... it was my thought that you're not allowed to smoke in a public place and I consider that a public place... BLM really should post a no smoking sign in the pool area... and I guess that's all I got to say about that ...won't be returning but I'm sure the locals will be happy about that... they seem to want to dominate the pools with they're smoking and bringing their dogs into the pools...  they don't  volunteer to clean the pools but they sure like to use them...<//Text>

Holtville hot springs is interesting. There are soak pools here and a sprinkler type device for cooling off. There are restrooms here too. Across the road is a Long Term Visitors Area (LTVA) where you can pay $180 and stay in a self-contained RV for an entire season. Or you can pay $40 for 14 days. Many Canadian Snowbirds stay here in the winter and soak their retirement days away in the cement tubs.  It seems very pleasant. It's desert land so be prepared for that. It's not far from the freeway exit. On the south side of the freeway is free BLM land for camping.<//review>

Good chiliques. Get the verde (green) sauce with chorizo and ask for hot sauce. They brought a Chipotle crema hot sauce which was quite good. Nice patio as well. My wife had lemon curd pancakes which she liked.</text>

I like the new decor, but more than that I like that it has the same ambience and friendly atmosphere as Picazo on Arnold (where you can find the BEST latte in the valley). Food delicious and portions enormous. Actually too much good food. Is that a complaint or compliment? Compliment! Wishing Sal and his family great success. Happy to have them in the hood.</Text>< pics>

< Review>
This was the first time my husband and I have been to picazio. I ordered the cauliflower crispy tacos with a side order of french fries and my husband had the corn. My cauliflower crispy tacos were stuffed with cauliflower and topped with a crispy coleslaw.  The corn tortillas had spicy hot sauce included and the french fries were sliced very thin hot crispy and spicy. Just delicious. I would have a hard time going there again and not ordering the cauliflower tacos. The corn my husband had was absolutely delicious. The corn was rubbed in mayonnaise and cheeses with a spicy sauce and crispy bacon bits, fabulous. The reason I didn't give five stars is because drink I ordered was a mule and it tasted like soda I don't even know there was a full shot of vodka in there. I would not order that again.<//Review>

<Review>Their burgers are great, but do not ever order the ramen. It is straight up the worst soup I've ever had. Like, ever. There's not even a can of chef boyardee that's worse than their soup.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Wonderful dining experience. . Vegan options for me which is always a bonus. Bplenty of variety of food  The food was beautifully presented.

< Review>
I drive from Tahoe to Sonoma just to go to Picazo’s Cafe. Now that they have the kitchen open, I would gladly drive from Tahoe and back to have lunch at their cafe, and then Tahoe to Sonoma again for dinner at their kitchen. This place is amazing, and if Picazo’s can’t succeed on that corner where Mint and Liberty and the Breakaway, then no one can! They are the essence of Sonoma in my opinion! Go there! Go now! Do it!</Review>

<text>Good food whenever you get it.  Simple cheese burger nothing on it but spicy aioli and grilled onions. Ordered that burger an hour ago and all the people who came in after us had received there food first. Very Disappointed with the wait! Understanding it’s a new business it takes times to work out the kinks but when I received my burger there was no aioli aswell the onions were cold. Grilled onions cold? I don’t know about you but after I grill onions their hot!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

< Review>
I recommend not coming here, three of my fingers were cut badly while filing. I asked for regular polish, but painted my nails with gel polish. i didn’t know during the process. When it came to pay they told me i had to pay for gel because they used it and “ gel looks nicer”, but i told her that if it’s their mistake, i shouldn’t have to pay for that much more, when i clearly said i didn’t want gel because i didn’t have the money then.< /Review>

<name>Kim Dessaussois< /name><time>1507317783664</time><rating>1< /rating><review>They are good at putting nails on but taking them off is a different story.  Instead of taking the nails off in a safe manner that wouldn't damage my own nails, she took a new nail, slid it under the old nail and just ripped them off taking several layers of my own nail with it.  It hurt to say the least, not to mention it ruined my own nails.  There was fungus growing under two of my nails that I had to go to a doctor to treat effectively.  Their prices might be cheaper but in the long run it will cost you more.  I will never go back to this salon.  Save yourself all the b.s. and pain by going somewhere more professional.< /review>< pictures>

Prices are a little high. Salon needs some cleaning & updated paint. Otherwise the service is great.<//text>

They did a good job on my nails, but as for friendly, not so much.  They were at best, cordial. The technician addressed me with a series of hand movements and grunts. No actual words until telling me the price.< /text>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>I have visited this place a few times and they were ok. I rarely had a long wait. The manicure and pedicures were always good. Loved getting my pedi here because the foot massage was great and so relaxing. The thing I disliked about this place was that they don’t like to turn people away so people end up waiting sometimes or they do a rush job on you. Like when I needed my eyebrows done. They completely gave me a line on my eyebrows as if it was shave off but not on purpose. They could have just admit that they made a mistake but instead they talk about you in their native language, very unprofessional and rude. I do not recommend this place if you do not have an appointment!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><GmapID>0x8085566e88e5f995:0x8710cef6c85c23e4</GmapID>< username>

<Text>If I could give this place no stars I would....

Every time I went in there to get my eyebrows done they would act like I'm asking for charity and made me wait an hour for it....

I Have called for an estimated and she just hang up in my face....

When I do get my eyebrows done they always different... they don't know how to do eyebrows...

My nails are always something wrong with them....

I often thought about patronizing this nail spa and I did today. It was well worth the price. I received a foot massage with hot rocks and a mini back massage.  I was truly pampered. Thanks!< /text>

<review>The worst I’ve ever had. I’ve been trying new places and am sorry after this.  One nail is crooked. I tried telling her and she says “I know I know I know” but never fixed it. The polish was too thick and uneven in places so my nails look THICK. Three of ten look ok. Never ever again!</review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

I would hope i can give a 0 star to this place. For a toyota corolla, i ended up paying about $400 for ONLY 4 days.

I am a student, I was trying to get a cheap rental car.
On the website, they claimed unlimited mileage was $6 per day. It was extremely cheap, so I fell into their trap.

this is how they con me.

lets calculated how much l lost:
base price:                                                   $6 per day
insurance(they said covers everything): $21.99* per day
add another 400 miles:                              $15 per day
Total per day:                                               $ 42.99 per day !!!
I scratched a little on the bumper:    paid another $250
Yes, that insurance DOES NOT COVER EVERYTHING!!!!
for 4 days:                                  42.99 x 3 + 250=$419.32

Not just only me argued with them, when I returned the car, there was an Indian gentleman argued with them of the unlimited mileage they lied, and another Asian lady was arguing about the price they change during a phone call with them the day before.
As a car rental company, they provide extremely bad customer service.
In conclusion, please do not rent their car, this is a very small company and they want to earn fast money.
I have the videos of 3 parties arguing with NU car rental/Deanza car rental. Feel free to email me for more information and / or videos.< /text>

<text>The car was clean and ran smoothly. They gave me the car and received the car in a quick and professional fashion. It’s a bit weird to get a shuttle ride from a person and be driven to a business district, with no other car rental companies nearby. It feels off, especially at night. But it’s a legit operation. It was cheaper than everyone else, so it’s probably forgivable. The shuttle driver was very willing to drive us to the airport making sure that we got to the plane on time. So I appreciate the extra effort on good customer service.</text><time>1502692836832</time><rating>3</rating><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><Name>Joey Alan Le<//Name><gmap_id>0x80dcde57a58e4a9b:0xc6404591dff616e8<//gmap_id></record>

I rented a car from here for 1 week.  I read the reviews on the way to pick up my reservation and saw all the reviews about not getting their deposits back.  So after a week I returned the car and was told I will receive my deposit back within 10 days.  I needed another car for 2 days the following week, so I decided to go to a more reputable company.  I'm glad I did because it's been a month and I still haven't seen my deposit back yet. I call them 2-3 times, no one answered. When they finally answered, one of the Rep I talked to told me to text him my info, so I did. He told me he will have it processed.  A week later I text him again, he said it will be processed that Thurs. Another week goes by, I text him again, now no answer.  I called the company again, they told me they will call me back.  I'm going to call my credit card company to report a fraud. I also report the 5 stars ratings from their employees to google.  Save your time and money and go somewhere else.  If I do get my deposit back within a week of posting this then I will update my rating.  If not, I will post this everywhere I can and report them to BBB.< /Review>

DO NOT USE THEM! I would post no stars if Google would let me. They will keep your deposit! Then, they will delete all negative reviews that let people know they keep your deposit. I saw that last week when I called to ask for my deposit and now there are (miraculously) three 5 star ratings. I called 2 times and did not get it back or hear back. They don't let you speak to a manager (how convenient!). Save your money and go with someone reputable! I am about to fill out a complaint with the better business bureau. I recommend you do the same if you do not get your money back.</Text>

<review>This car rental doesn't even deserve one star. The staff were very rude and made it very complicated. After they said that we needed to make a deposit and sign a bunch of stuff we said that we would cancel our car rental from them because it seemed a bit sketchy. They basically said that we wouldn't get our money back if we left so we were forced to stay. The man there said that we had to pay a $150.00 deposit. He said we would get it back in 7 to 11 days after the car return. Its been about 3 weeks and we still haven't gotten our money back. I called and they hung up on he when I asked for the money back. NEVER rent from this place. They are a scamming, rude, lying company.< /review></record>

<Time>1469815477630</Time><rate>1</rate><text>First of all,  if you live in the area, make sure you call them to get the price you found online. Otherwise, you have to pay an extra $10/day you rent the car if you want unlimited miles (I think they give you 150miles/day otherwise). Yes, I know it's advertised that you get unlimited miles online but if you read the fine print on the SECOND email that you're supposed to get from them (I did not receive this email by the way)  or if you clicked on the link that's on the fine print of the travel website you booked it on,  it should tell you these rules. But if you don't, they have print outs of the fine print for you at the office to prove it. Really though,  it should be on the main page. I didn't have this problem when I booked with a bigger company.

Second, they add a $150 security deposit that would be refunded (assuming of course you bring the car back OK and didn't use tolls or whatever) which is fine but the problem comes when I have to call them 3x to get the deposit back. It's been a month since I returned the car and since I called them the third time, it's been processed. Apparently they had a glitch in the system and I wasn't processed but now I am so
I should be happy? Right... I am supposed get it this week... If I don't, I will update this review.

Another point,  though this is minor and almost comical, the car I rented told me it needed an oil change shortly after driving away. It had about 5000miles on it so I was hoping this wasn't the first oil change but you know, not really my problem.

I will say the people who worked there are nice enough. I was upgraded to a bigger car with a backup camera because of my "troubles" from the first point and that's where the one star comes from. But honestly, I'm just going to go for a bigger car company from now on.

***UPDATE: did not receive my deposit yet and it's been 5 business days but I did have my bank call and try to get it sorted. Hopefully I see it by the end of the day.
My advice, make sure you get a transaction number when the people tell you "it's been processed" and get the accounting department number so you can talk to them too. (Though don't expect much because they didn't answer for a long time and their voicemail box is full)<//text>< Pics>

<text>Oh my God. The fact how much they are impolite impressed me a lot. When they met us at the airport the driver just opened a rear right window of the car and asked: "Rental cars?", then, when I answered "yes" he invited me to sit in just by a jester of his head. Instead of going out of the car, helping with the bags, introducing himself etc.

At the place there was a line of unsatisfied clients. One couple left because they decided not to have anything to do with them considering their improfessinalism as we did later. Mainly, as I understood they left because they had to wait for 25 minutes.

Our reservation clearly showed "unlimited mileage" while at the place we found out that in small letters in terms and conditions  it was written that this is only in case we have a flight ticket. Otherwise,  for unlimited mileage we had to pay extra.

Finally, despite of the fact that the money is not refundable, we asked to bring us back to the airport and we used Enterprise ad we always do. And by the way, we didn't have any problems with them.

Conclusion: yes, this Deanza is cheaper than Enterprise, but it is not worth getting so much more gray hair while dealing with these guys. This was my the worst experience with rental cars ever.< /text>< Pictures>

Got my reservation trough AMEX , when I went to their office in Santa Ana airport , first I noticed that the staff were mean and then they asked me if I wanted to have the unlimited mileage I need to pay $10/day , then for additional drivers is also $10 which is not stated in the agreement when I booked the car,
We are very disappointed and unhappy, we did not get the car. We went to FOX where we usually rent from , completely opposite, nice staff , even though they didn’t have a good deal for walking customers , but they helped us to go online and book, we went home almost midnight,
Unhappily with nu rental car and happy with Fox

I had a reservation but when I landed in the airport and  called for a shuttle they told me to take a taxi and they will reimburse me because they don't have a shuttle but when I got there they were people waiting for their cars and I found out that they do not have any cars available I was Furious and told them why did you tell me to take a shuttle if you don't have any cars available there was no answer. I I asked for refund for my taxi ride and they didn't wanted to give me the refund for the ride said it's not their problem. these people were rude, obnoxious and unprofessional the place didn't look like a rental place it look like and abandoned storefront. Please be aware at first it looks like you getting a good deal for your rental but in reality you're not, don't put yourself through this headaches, rent from a reputable Place rather than these scammers< /Review>

<Review>Be careful with your deposit. I gave $150 deposit and called several times during last 2 months and have not got it back yet. The location in OC gave me a phone number of their head quarter and I called back but no one picked up the phone. Finally I had to get my credit card for opening an dispute case.< /Review>< GmapID>

After 3 weeks, they had not refunded the $150 security deposit. I went back there in person to resolve. No problem with the rental, hooked me with an amazingly low daily rate. Just watch your credit card statement afterwards.< /Text>

AVOID this business at all cost!!!!   It looks like a good deal, and it is the worst deal out there! They hold a $150 deposit that they guarantee will be put back on your card when you return the car. Six months later I still have not not receive my deposit back. I disputed it through my credit card and they return 1/2 of the money. Claiming that I did not pay my tolls, which not only did I pay my tolls but I also have receipts for them.  This rental company is a scam!  AVOID!!! AVOID!!!! AVOID!!!!<//Review>

<review>I agree to most of the negative reviews. The only positive reviews of 5 stars are from the employees themselves as they are trying to fudge the review ratings. They give you cars that doesn't work properly, the cars that are used up so much that they break down, don't have a courtesy to apologize for inconvenience, lost time, messed up plans. When the car's transmission over heat, I was asked to come back all the way (70 miles) back to replace a new car. How thoughtful of them!!! I have to request them to replace the car to a close by airport. I was asked to fill up the gas when return the broken car. I could not believe what that guy was telling me. In addition, they charge for unlimited miles if you book online and if you are local. This was totally new to me. The lady was telling me to call them instead. IF that was the case then they should have advertized on those car rental websites that please call me for reservations. This is bordering cheating. I am worried about my deposit now reading other reviews. The only good thing that happened that they replaced a car which was a better car and the guy whom I deal with later Deano was really a gentleman, the only guy who knows meaning of  customer service. Never ever rent a car from this place.</review>< Pictures>

How about a negative 4 stars? Horrible. Understaffed, no cars avail. I rented a car and took a taxi there. Only one person behind the desk and no cars. Couldn't even guarantee me one after I offered to wait 20-30 min. I even called to confirm car was avail before arriving</Text>

If I could give them no stars. I WOULD! I called them when I landed and was told their shuttle service was out and for me to catch a Taxi and THEY would pay for it when I arrived. The Taxi company informed me they had been having issues with them not paying. I called them back and informed no one would take me without me paying for it. They then told me to pay for it and they would give me money back with receipt. When we pulled up the Taxi provided a receipt after much debate and argument. IT GETS BETTER! Nu Car Rental said they couldn't reimburse me right then and there. That they would do it at the end of my rental contract. The contract eneded we returned the vehicle and NEVER did I receive the $9.45 back on my card like I was told. I called and went back up after a week. The person at the counter told me he wasn't the one that took the receipt for it and would have to find it. He then ignored me and went on to next customer. I told him I did not have time to wait to please give me my money. He said he would have to call home office. I told him I had to leave and expected the refund back on my card and left. That was on December 29th! It is January 5th and they still have not reimbursed me for the Taxi that I took after they said they would pay for it. It is not a lot of money but it's the principal that they said I would be reimbursed and lied to me about and never fixed the issue. I WILL NEVER GO BACK! Called again! Justin said if $8.65 Is such a big thing to me he'll take it out of his wallet and pay it back to me then hung on me.< /Review>

-5 stars ...Bunch of thieves, liars. POS.....

Do not rent from them they will make things up ie damages, stains whatever just to keep your $150 deposit + whatever other other fees they make up. STAY away from them.< /review>

Worst Services.. Shuttle came after 40 min to pick up from the airport while other car rentals have a shuttle coming every 15 minutes at the airport. Don't ever book a car through Nu car to save few bucks. They do not value ur time or money!
Highly Disappointed!!!
They do not have a customer service, no one picks up or returns your calls. Wasted almost 1 hour at the airport waiting for shuttle.
Their staff is slow as well.<//Review>

Shuttle only comes every 35 minutes. Desk is understaffed and slow so once you get there you wait another 45 minutes. All in, from the time you land, it could easily take you 90 minutes to get a car. Not worth it. Would also avoid the guy named Richard at the desk if there is anyone else who can help you.<//text>

</dataset><record>
<review>Don't do it!!!  When you land, you're supposed to call to get a shuttle to pick you up and take you to the lot.  There's only one catch:  NO ONE ANSWERS THE !@#ING PHONE!  Orbitz should be ashamed they offer these guys as a choice.  I gave 1 star because they won't let you give 0.<//review>< gmap_id>

I have never dealt with someone so rude in my life. They gave me a rental with a dented trunk that flew up on me twice, the car needed 50 dollar coolant in it because they didn't check the levels before they let us rent it, and the tires where so flat that they had to be filled 3 times. The man wouldn't give us a receipt and was rude, arrogant, and put false claims saying we smoked in the vehicle when it is not true. He said he smoked himself and that is how he knew, but if you smoke you can't smell smoke. So now we are charged an extra 300 plus a windshield chip that was no bigger than a bb and they are charging us for it. They probably rented it out dented because they wanted to charge someone to pay for the fixes that were originally needed.  Unsafe vehicles and customer service is at its lowest there. Thought we were doing good only paying 12 dollars a day but now they are adding about 1000 dollars more.<//Text>

Here are the pros and cons:

Pros: The price was good. And the car was fine without major issues during the two days I drove in it. And I went to the rental place myself so I didn't have to wait long.

Cons: I haven't been this mad for ages!!!!!! They charged me the airport shuttle fee when I didn't use the service at all! And after reflecting the information, they said that I should call the travel agency (Orbitz) I reserved the car from myself cause there is nothing they can do when they are the people that charged that fee! They had me pay 300 bucks cash deposit as I didn't have a credit card. And even on the website it clearly stated that the refunded money should be refunded upon returning the car with no damage, they claimed that since I signed the contract that I would wait for 7- 10 days, I can either come pick it up myself or they will mail the money to me after the period of time.

Granted it was my fault that I didn't read through the whole contract, but that was also because I was busy getting the 300 cash for deposit when they didn't accept my debit card! (credit card is required upon rental was in the contract I signed with Orbitz, but I was able to reserve the car with my debit card and 300 dollars deposit was definitely not in the contract) And I am more than sure they said that I could bring my paper as receipt to get my deposit back when I returned the car! Their reply to that was: " Who told you that? Still, there is nothing I can do."

The worst part was, the manager at that location was so awful! The worst I ever encountered with. Not only she blamed everybody else for all the issues that occurred (Orbitz and me). She claimed that I had been wasting her time for 20 minutes so she couldn't do her work when I was trying to sort out the situation. (I got to that place at 16:57 and honestly only brought up the issue after 17:00. She made that statement at 17:07 which made the statement ridiculous and not true at all!  ) And really, so she couldn't do her job?" I thought this is a company that sells rental SERVICE!!!!!!!!! Plus, there were no other customers there at that time with 3 staffs present!!!!

Along with other nonsense...she claimed that she couldn't check the toll toll road bill at the spot (why they had to keep my CASH deposit for 7- 10 days) because she didn't know how to check it and she refused my proposal to show her how to!

So many of these ridiculous statements, it's RIDICULOUS!!!!!< /Text>< pictures>

Do not be tempted to rent a car here.  They will charge you a $150.00 cleaning deposit and you will never get  it back!!  They keep promising to take care of it and you cannot get a hold of the finance office.  Stay away from these scam artists!</Review>

This is a scam.  I rented a car there for 2 days through Expedia.  Expedia booked the car for $39.00.  When I got there the guy at the counter charged me $49.00 with the excuse for the airport fee and the location is not even in the airport.  Expedia honored the quote so they refunded me the difference.  Deanza charged my credit card $150 for deposit and only return it back to me after 3 phone calls and 2 months later.  This car rental try to rip off people anyway they can, stay away from these crooks.< /Review>

<Review>If you are looking for your car rental deposit NOT being returned to you, this is the PLACE. I rented the car for 3 days and upon returning the car on June 28th was informed by the manager of Newport Beach branch - TYLER - that the rental deposit will be process within 7-10 days. And I called again on July 8th to ask for deposit and Tyler said it would be refunded on July 10th, 2016.  Now it's been almost a month and no refund, no reply to email inquiry and nothing. Best to file dispute with the credit card and let them handle it. Such a crappy and cheating kind of this company shouldn't have existed. Turns out so many people had the same problem with De Anza Car Rental - had to fight to get their deposits back.<//Review>< Pics>

Guys, please stay away from NU Car Rental, horrible and disgusting customer service. I booked my Car but the Horrible NU Car Rentals don't have the car for my trip, even though I already had a confirmation number. I wish I could have the option to give them 0Starts.
Please Please and Please don't book your car, they will ruin your car or trip...<//Text>

WARNING! DO NOT RENT ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!This is the worst company you want to deal with. They hold your $150 deposit and won't release it until you call them- No matter what! Their contract says that they must return the deposit in 10 days, but unless you call them, they will NOT return your deposit which is illegal! Not to mention that they give you lower class car instead of the higher class (more expensive rental) car you paid for!!<//Text>

Same thing happened to me car is okay but they won't give the deposit back after months of calling them! After reading this reviews, I'm gonna report this rental company to the news people so they can investigate what's going on! They're not even that big company like others to say that they're busy but they're not! They're just supposed to hold your deposit not charged them!< /review>

Anais L. Provided Great customer service in helping me switch from metro, I felt at ease and comfortable no pressure. Anais L. was very knowledgeable of all spifcanions when helping me pick a phone and transferring all my information. She very capable of running a store alone and multitasking. I felt very welcomed to the boost family because of Anais L.< /Review>

Great experience at this store. I had to switch from my old provider and Carlos was very friendly, helped me get a brand new phone and helped me unlock my iPhone.  Highly recommend this location.</text>

<Review>Zero Stars both girls were very RUDE, I went in with my family and husband. I was doing a private transaction but also porting my number! First off they didn't know my husband speaks spanish(iamafricanamericanwoman) they basically put a damper on my private traction even though I was porting 2 numbers to there company . They were talking to me in english and the other people in spanish. My husband was translating the whole time. The other people even was looking at me funny like I was trying to scam them. My family and other couple left the store and as soon as we walked out they completed my private transaction. They stated that they knew the 2 girls at the counter was just trying to make me look stupid. I am so HAPPY that there are people in this world who isnt as closed minded and SIMPLE as the two woman in here. I still got my service at a nice warming welcoming boost mobile and they through in free case for my iphone for my inconvenience . YOU GUYS NEED BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE. In this case I feel very discriminated against so if you want to feel low and underestimated then GO HERE other wise go to other one on GAREY or something. Its 2018 who acts like that still. MONEY has no color right?< /Review><Time>1522165472461</Time><Rate>1</Rate>< gmapID>

<text>The bluff trail was fabulous. Only a 4 mile round trip. The wind was disrupting the smooth sea.  Loads of people enjoying the scenery.  Wildflowers were here and there.  Problem is, there is very little parking.   Come early if you want to park< /text>< gmap_id>

This trail is perfect for a leisurely walk with beautiful coastal cliff scenery. The trail is flat with little elevation gain unless you decide to climb down to the water (we did!). I loved the artistic bench areas to stop and soak in the sights. Dogs are allowed on leash, and our puppy loved the various brush and vegetation along the way. Most of the trail is safely away from the cliffs, but there are short smaller side trails that take you closer to the edge if you're interested in a better view. It's probably safest to keep children on the main trail and dogs securely on leash. We saw large birds swooping overhead as well as sea lions (or seals?) basking in the sun on the rocks. Squirrels ran from hole to hole. So there's lots of wildlife to observe and enjoy. The coastal breeze keeps you cool, but you might want sun screen since there's little to no shade. Overall, it's a very pleasurable, easy walk.</Review>

They have it set up on a one way in a circle at the moment. So if you feel the need to social distance this is a good place for you. Also part of it is paved and a board walk.

Beautiful scenery,  and a nice light workout. Many trails to choose from, and it's never overly crowded. I live 4 hours away from here, and would make the drive weekly if I could.< /review>

The trail was amazing, the views breathtaking. Just be aware of where you're walking as our doggo was found with a tick as well as in one of our heads.<//review>

<Review>Nice scenic views all along these trails. The whole preserve is small and crisscrossed with trails. Fairly busy, although could be that during Covid times everyone's new favorite hobby is walking.  Definitely a good place to see hawks flying low and fat curious ground squirrels. (Probably future hawk food)<//Review>< pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>No trip to the Cambria and Central Coast Area should be complete without a visit to the bluff Trail. This is a one-of-a-kind experience on the fiscalini Ranch Preserve which protects over 400 Acres of beautiful Coastal land. This easy to find & walk Trail starts on Windsor Road highlighting the coastline which gives you the most beautiful views of cliffs, Canyons boulders flora and fauna. This is where mountains, forests and the ocean meet. On a cool January evening you'll find green grass Meadows meeting the rugged cliffs along the coastline. Explorer the small little Trails off the main trail which leads you closer to the cliffs, but be careful! They can be pretty steep. One of my favorite parts of this Trail are the unique benches you'll find scattered throughout. Each one is dedicated to a different family or person but made in such Grand and special ways. They are big benches and when you sit on them you feel like you're sitting on a throne and the best part is they give you the best views of the ocean. Pack a lunch, pack some snacks and water and enjoy the beautiful views. Dog friendly, must be on a leash. Wheelchair and bicycle accessible!</Text>< Pics>

Not from this area but man what a beautiful hike. Hearing the birds chirping, the view of the water, seals, dolphins, and the squirrels running across the grass lands was just what me and my husband needed to feel at peace.</Text>

<Text>The Fiscalini Ranch Preserve in Cambria is a wonderful place to visit. A large preserve which was a cattle ranch is now a protected area with great views along the Pacific Ocean. Several pathways to hike or just walk and take in the fresh air and scenery. There are several benches along the pathway nearest the water where you can relax and look for wildlife. Or take a lite lunch in your pack and enjoy.<//Text>< Name>

This is amazing. Never been here before in 46 years. To walk the trail and to be greeted with a "hello" or "good morning" by everyone on the trail is the best. Everyone on here seems friendly and polite. This was a random getaway from reality. Will definitely come back again.</review>

<review>Beautiful, flat walk along the bluff with spectacular views of the dramatic central coast. Benches to sit and rest/meditate or just enjoy the view. Never crowded and people very friendly. Mostly locals. No restrooms but nicely kept pathways. About a mile one way or 2 miles round trip. Many times one can see otters, hawks, ground squirrels, egrets and whales during migration season. Wheelchair accessible.</review><Resp>None<//Resp><user>109729764494693706943<//user><time>1558923380667< /time><username>Tony Sanchez< /username><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rating>

A beautiful stretch of California's middle coast. The views are breath taking and the area is really large so even if others are around you don't see them constantly.</Review>

<review>Very nice place to walk. Trail is wheelchair accessible. Beautiful views. Dog friendly, but must be on leash. There is squirrel rabbits ferret and dogs have been knows to fall over the cliff chasing after them. It is open anytime. From the bluff tr.ail you can go uphill to other connecting trails.</review></record>

Excellent little cafe. Reasonable prices for breakfast. Good quick service. Unlimited coffee. It was virtually across the street from our hotel the Americania. The restaurant/bar attached to the hotel had high prices for what you get so this place fitted the bill for the rest of our stay in San Francisco.< /text>

<Text>The breakfast sandwich that i had was great, but the secret is in the waffles. My sister had one and said it was the best waffle she's had anywhere in a long time.  Delicious milk shakes and smoothies. Very friendly service, and decent prices. Will definitely go back if I'm in the area again. (This breakfast was better than the one that i had to pay for at my hotel)< /Text>< name>

Ehh, I feel bad leaving this review so low but the food was ok, the place felt like a subway, and the only napkins were tissues. The lady that made the food was super nice and did her best to make everything by herself, but she seemed overwhelmed. The food was bland and over priced for what you got. :/ sorry.<//review>

It's open again. New location is at 7th and Natoma, across the street from Custom Burger. It's clean and well-lit, which is mostly what one can ask for in this area. Average coffee and food. Friendly owner.< /review>
<Response>{'time': 1408146688779, 'text': "I'm glad you appreciated the friendly service, Eric, but disappointed that you thought the coffee and food were just average -- that's not something we usually hear. I'd love to have more specific details about what you ordered, and any suggestions for how it could be improved. Hope you're able to visit us again soon to find a dish you love!

The truth is that it is perfect for breakfast and not away from the interesting area of ​​San Francisco and save money, because the prices are affordable and the products have nothing to envy to those of other places. We had breakfast for two people for about $ 12.5, practically half of what we paid the day before and more or less ate the same thing. The place is quite large, with many chairs to sit comfortably and relax or watch the outside watching the busy life of downtown San Francisco, highly recommended and economical, a pity that we discovered on the last day of our vacation

Desayunamos dos personas por unos 12,5 dólares, prácticamente la mitad que pagamos el día anterior y más o menos comimos lo mismo.

(Translated by Google) Normal breakfast (Royal Seven) at a perhaps too high price in a small but clean restaurant. I particularly liked the pancake, which was freshly fried in the pan. Is more of a pancake than a fat American pancake. There were four of us here and everyone was satisfied. Nothing special, but not bad either. Smoothies are different than you know them. The Oatmeal is made only with water and a bit too bland. There are 9 tables for 4 people plus 7 bar chairs in front of a large window.

I had the Royal Seven breakfast with 5 different items and it was good, but a little bit too expensive. The freshly made pancakes were delicious but a little different. The smoothies were a bit different from what I know, too. There were a lot of satisfied, but not overwhelmed. The restaurant provides about 9 tables for 4 people and about 7 seats in front of a big window.

Normales Frühstück (Royal Seven) zu einem vielleicht etwas zu hohen Preis in einem kleinen,  aber sauberen Restaurant. Mir hat insbesondere der Pancake sehr gut geschmeckt, der frisch in der Pfanne gebraten wurde. Ist allerdings mehr ein Eierkuchen als ein dicker amerikanischer Pancake. Wir waren zu viert hier und alle waren zufrieden. Nichts besonderes,  aber auch nicht schlecht. Smoothies sind anders,  als man diese kennt. Das Oatmeal ist nur mit Wasser gemacht und etwas zu fade. Es gibt 9 Tische für 4 Personen und zusätzlich 7 Barstühle vor einem großen Fenster.

I had the Royal Seven breakfast with 5 various items and it was good,  but a little bit too expensive. The freshly made pancakes were delicious but a little different (thinner) than the commonly known. The smoothies were a bit different from what I know, too. There were for of us and everyone was satisfied,  but not overwhelmed. The restaurant provides about 9 tables for 4 people and approximately 7 additionally seats in front of a big window.<//Review>

We were bummed at the checkout on the final price of the goods. Most are not labeled and are later very pricey in fact. It seems they try to rip off the tourists here.< /Review>

Avoid at any cost. As described by others  in previous reviews, I felt scammed at checkout when they made up a ridiculous price for just 2 fruits (since nothing is not labelled).</Review>

< Review>
Stayed at King George Hotel which is basically right next door. This place is conveniently located, BUT everything was overpriced and some snacks were expired. Bottle of water is way expensive, a regular sized bag of chips was $5 dollars, cigs were like $13, and I got these cookies that were hard (no longer fresh) and totally expired once I looked at the date. Just take a walk around the corner a little more to the Walgreens and get your water and snacks for a more afforable price.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) I know what an Indian owner is.
The tax and envelope values ​​are subtly received separately.
Why do not you go to UNIQLO
I can see a big supermarket selling good wine and cheap.

Added: $ 35 in walgreen whiskey for $ 80

(Original)
인도 주인장이면 뭐 알만하지만
교묘하게 세금과 봉투값도 따로 받습니다.
왠망하면 바로 근처 유니클로를 찾아가시다 보면
좋은 와인 싸게 파는 큰 슈퍼마켓이 보입니다.

추가: walgreen 에서 35불짜리 위스키 80불에 판매함 ㅋ<//review>

Walked in on a Saturday night. This was my first time at this place and I found it by their amazing yelp reviews.
There was a good amount of people there.
The music selection was great also!

Highly recommend this place.</text>

Lovely spot with great food cooked with authenticity,  love and attention. The interior is very architecturally clean with a lot of straight lines and edges. We had a little bit of everything on the menu and it was all delicious, well seasoned and appropriately portioned. The watermelon gazpacho with the fresh oysters was a  huge standout amongst the starters. For entree, I had the pasta of the day and it was soooooooooooo tasty, spaghetti with spicy chicken sausage and broccolini tossed in an oil based sauce. We also had the vegetarian paella which was lovely. Heaven!<//Review>

<Text>We had read a bit about the restaurant before we decided to try it, hearing mostly about the wine available but not about the food. After receiving some great recommendations from the waitress, each dish proved better than the last. The Moroccan spiced carrots, polenta, and salted branzino were all incredible, and the recommended wine pairing was the perfect match. Our favorite dish though, was probably the Grilled Spring Onions, Feta, Pistachio Butter, Prunes, Lemon. I definitely recommend trying that one, I don't think you will be disappointed!</Text>< name>

Being kinda done with Chaya across the street, my wife and I popped in to Chez Tex and thought it was outstanding.  We love French food, and this certainly did not disappoint.  We look forward to returning.</Review>

<user>104247168091304838010< /user><review>This mechanic shop is the Best! Arturo(owner) and his staff are amazing 🤩 they are on top of things and know what they’re performing on your vehicle. I’m very satisfied with the work they have done to my car, they’ve worked on my Honda accord and now on my Nissan Altima, I’m happy with their work!

This shop is affordable and if it’s something you may not afford at the moment Arturo will explain what is urgent to take care of and what can wait for later. I highly recommend this mechanic shop to anyone. I’ve recommended  this to family and friends and they are very satisfied as well😀

Thank you Arturo and staff!<//review><gmap_id>0x80dd36aecc0bbf2b:0xf64ff7c40778ddba</gmap_id><rating>5< /rating></record>

Arturo has helped me with the alignments on all my cars. I recently asked if he could install a lift kit on my truck & he said he could, I really can't say enough good things.

Arturo is straight forward and explains what he needs to do and why he needs to do it.  I appreciate a communicative mechanic.  Definitely coming back.< /Text>

<Text>Brought my car to this place for an alignment and they said they did it and that I also need new front tires so I went to get new ones and came back like they told me to cause they said they may need to do adjustments. When I left my car was still unaligned. They never even did the alignment just drove my car around the block about 5 times. Never will I come back to this place.<//Text><user>109678297637793587094<//user><Date>1589222009297</Date>< GmapID>

<rating>5< /rating><Date>1572574525425</Date><Text>Honest review from and honest person. For starts I would like to shout out Arturo (owner)  For being genuine and honest. I usually handle all repairs when it comes to my baby(01 Mazda Miata) save some money and I do not TRUST Auto repair shops (shady mechanics). Let me tell you this shop is far from that. With my work schedule and severity of the issue (blown rear caliper) I had no time to fix myself. Out of all the shops surrounding my work place this was the one I stumbled into (glad I did). From the start I was attended to in a timely and very professional matter. I expressed to Arturo that I was dropping the car off during work hours (11am) and would need it before my shift is over (5pm) As I am not local to the area. Arturo assured me he would service my vehicle and have it ready by then. Sure enough my car was ready at 3pm. Replaced rotors and pads all around including two rear caliper replacements and brake system flush. Very reasonable priced and top notch Work. Definitely worth giving Arturo a chance.<//Text>< pics>

Very knowledgeable staff. We were referred to Long Beach Alignment & Auto Repair, by another local business. A good sign, in itself. We now service all our family cars with Long Beach Alignment & Auto Repair. I can send my wife by herself to them, and not worry about work to be done, or pricing. A great place.</review>

I've brought my Jeep here and I was told what was wrong with it, and they told me that the vehicle should still be covered through factory warranty.

Good service, friendlly and accesable staff. And very good prices. After shopig around this place has the best prices and value. And they don't rip u off. They break down what you need and seem to be upfront about everything. I would reccomend. Downside: cash ONLY and it's hard to talk over the phone since they rarelly answer.<//Text>

Food is decent. Not the best sushi around though. Service could be improved. We went last Saturday and the place was almost packed. But there was one server handling all the tables. Also, we were waiting outside for a table that was already empty and cleaned for about 15 minutes before they sat us.</review>

<review>This place has some of the best sushi. The employees are knowledgeable and always playing around with different flavors that always seem to work just right. Try the Tasmanian rolls or their Ring of Fire sushi rolls. You can ask for any specials as well that may not even be on the menu as well 😉 During COVID, there is seating outside and menus that can be scanned with your phone. Enjoy!<//review>< username>

This really is the best sushi in town. We have tried them all. I am never disappointed with their sushi. We have celebrated many birthdays and girls nights here. We have tried just about every roll and they are all delicious. The appetizers and desserts and the kids meals are great too. We ordered a platter for my kids birthday yesterday and it did not dissapoint. Can't wait to come for another Monday night girls night soon!</Review>

< review>
Pretty good sushi! Was full after 2 veggie rolls (the lounge lizard and the green monster specifically) and a hand roll (the lobster - not my favorite item).
The lobster is like a shredded "lobster salad", I just prefer chunks of lobster is all. The Cocomo was delicious and sweet and crunchy. The tasmanian devil was really good with layers of flavor. Not enough salmon on the menu (according to my salmon loving guest) and the specialty rolls were really expensive (paying $16-17 for a  special roll, which we usually do at sushi places, wasnt happening here). The parking is ample, and the waiters were very nice and attentive the whole time.</review>

<review>The Strawberry Roll here on their secret menu is sooooo good! We drove all the way from Cardiff because I was craving it mmmmm. For some reason their Garlic Edamame is better than Encinitas too. Love Sushi Lounge, we seriously have it 2 times a week!< /review>< userid>

<Review>Very delicious and on-point sushi rolls but I found the prices to be a bit on the expensive side given the ambience. That being said, this has become a nice go-to Sushi place for me near Rancho Bernardo due to its proximity to other stores like Dollar Tree, Big5, and Walmart.</Review>< Pictures>

We have been eating at Poway Sushi since they first opened.  This was to be our last try because pre covid visits had not been great.  Since they moved into the larger space service had been spotty at best.  Today was a return to Poway Sushi previous level of service.   James was attentive and kind.  The sushi was also back to excellent.  Thank you James.< /Text>

Good spot, good food. No wow factor, but gold sushi if you're in the mood. $15 rolls were a little steep. Went in and had edemame, 3 rolls and 2 soft drinks and spent about $60.< /Text>

Fast and super friendly service! Each roll was independently creative and tasty and the service was super fast even on a Friday night before a holiday weekend. Service was great gave good recommendations and anticipated our needs well. The only downside the rolls are a little higher priced than other local spots within 5-10 miles. We eat out a lot and this was such a pleasure!</review>

We were a party of four for Sushi happy hour on a Tuesday night. We enjoyed the drink and the sushi and the service was appropriate for the environment. Parking was a little scarce, however the hostess was polite and the seating was just right. The waiter never introduced himself though he kept us applied with drink and sushi! If you're in the Poway/RB area and you're looking for sushi this is your place. If you are on a date, don't expect it to be quiet or romantic, however you want go away hungry.</review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>We were a party of four for Sushi happy hour on a Tuesday night. We enjoyed the drink and the sushi and the service was appropriate for the environment. Parking was a little scarce, however the hostess was polite and the seating was just right. The waiter never introduced himself though he kept us applied with drink and sushi! If you're in the Poway/RB area and you're looking for sushi this is your place. If you are on a date, don't expect it to be quiet or romantic, however you want go away hungry.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<text>Okay service, okay sushi,.  Good atmosphere.  Tempura was okay too not the best.   They could roll the rolls better and use better mean.  Tempura could be better quality too.   I hope to see move improvement soon.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Excellent sushi! The rolls are a little higher priced than the norm but they make them pretty fat so the price increase is worth it. The krab stuffing and rice have a slightly different but very good taste. I live in TX but if I get the chance to come again I definitely will!< /text>

This is a review based on the food and service after they moved to their new location. There has obviously been a lot of staffing changes including the servers that I have seen at the previous location. The current staff does not know the menu and are not entirely helpful. The wait is long and they seem very disorganized. Instead of dining in I decided to order pick-up today which took twice as long as it should have on the phone. I was told it would be longer than usual preparation time and they would be ready at 5:55, which was fine. I came to pick up my to-go order at exactly that time. When they found my order I discovered the rolls were much warmer than they should be! My food was likely sitting out for quite some time. If I choose to eat raw fish I expect it to be sushi grade and kept at an appropriate temperature!

I enjoy the rolls at Sushi Lounge, despite their predictable American spin, but I will not choose to dine here any longer. If you're looking for an authentic experience, great sushi and great service, I suggest Ichizen by Five Guys and Michael's. You won't be getting any asparagus there, though!

Goodbye Poway Sushi Lounge, you've lost my business. Please train your staff and get your act together.<//text>

Tried a sushi roll & a hand roll. Very sad that the rice was not seasoned. At least they were very generous with the pickled ginger.< /text>

<text>Pretty good food and Lynn the sushi chef was so polite and awesome! I would have given this place 5 stars but Jaden the hostess was pretty rude and made my gf and I feel very unwelcome! I believe a good host or hostess is important for a establishment like this being that it’s the first face you see while waiting to be seated.<//text>< user_id>

The sushi was fine but service was slow. Patio chairs are very uncomfortable unless you're super skinny. No ice available for drinks like iced tea - supposedly the ice machine was broken. I don't plan to return.<//text>

<Review>Lunch took 90min. The rice was dry, the lobster California roll was dry and had crushed up shell in it, the spicy crunch roll was good. The miso soup was delicious, but they're completely understaffed for lunch.  It seemed as if they were at 90% capacity with 1 server.< /Review><rate>2</rate>< user>

Every time I have been here I have had horrible service. Waited for menus over 5 min. Waited for water over 5 mins. My son finished 2 rolls before I even got my food. Horrible every time. The kicker is there were only 3 other tables at the time.</text>

<Text>This place has always been a favorite but since I've had to go gluten free, I have fallen even more in love. They have an entire gluten free menu and it's all amazing. The gluten free menu is on the pricey side and isn't included in the specials but sometimes I just want a special roll so it's worth it.< /Text>< Pictures>

Fast and super friendly service! Each roll was independently creative and tasty and the service was super fast even on a Friday night before a holiday weekend. Service was great gave good recommendations and anticipated our needs well. The only downside the rolls are a little higher priced than other local spots within 5-10 miles. We eat out a lot and this was such a pleasure!< /text>

The quality and innovative rolls was lacking for a restuarant with this type of price tag. Better options at more reasonable prices elsewhere.<//Review>

<review>dirty menu, dirty plates, dirty windows, servers apron very dirty...not a good start. Chicken bento box $15...terrible. Chicken dry and thin tons of mushrooms sauce was so hot felt like it was microwaved, sushi was overly warm. Server did not come back to check if food was OK until way too late, did not appologized just challenged what wrong, did not bring manager over or confirm if comping plate. By the way it was not busy at all, no vibe no one seemingly to care about anything, no attentive service.</review>< pictures>

Most of the menu consists of "unique" rolls, but I thought the execution was pretty mediocre. Sauces were watery, leaving the roll sitting in the sauce and becoming difficult to pick up without falling apart. Flavors and textures were mushy and muddled, leaving me to wonder how long they sat out before our server brought them out. Our server forgot about parts of our order, but we just let it go since we were unimpressed with the rest of the food. Won't be coming back, there are too many other good sushi places in town.<//text>

Double crunch and green monster are the best here. The lemonade roll (we sub halibut for shrimp) is also our top favs for sushi in poway. when you eat vegetarian you can eat it without thinking of bones or tails or skins  etc.... tasty tasty<//Review>

<rate>3<//rate><text>Nice place for lunch in middle of Poway in a business area.  Calamari appetizer is an amazing with dipping sauce.  I was little dissapointed when I noticed the sushi did not have the real crab meat.  Also I did not realize that the ice tea is not re-fillable, I was charge twice for that.  The ice tea is good in a normal size glass but not worth $5 for $15 lunch.< /text><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<Review>Excellent sushi, and sashimi dishes. The rolls are great too! The prices are reasonable for the quality and portions that you get. The service is fast and friendly. The only thing that needs improvement is the time it takes from ordering to getting the food on the table. It was 27 minutes from order to plate. We only ordered the chef's combo sashimi and one roll.
Definitely put this restaurant on your list of places to visit.</Review>< GmapID>
