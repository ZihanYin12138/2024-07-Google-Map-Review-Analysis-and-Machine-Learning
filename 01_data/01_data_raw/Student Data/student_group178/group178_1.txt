<review>I love the food at Firenza. The quality of the food and the selection is far superior to any of the fast casual pizza places around. I went with a group of friends and got to share several things and everything was super delicious.<//review><date>1601270214774</date>< userid>

Pompeii has true heart, the food is consistently authentic Italian, fresh, authentic Italian choices and a wonderful selection of wines. What we most look forward to is the whole experience, including the Pompeii server team. Now that we are doing take-out every Friday when we used to come in, I look forward to seeing our familiar faces of Francisco and Carlos and the team. We appreciate what they do for our community. Please support Pompeii during these challenging times, enjoy the food and experience!<//text>< Pics>

Very traditional Italian restaurant, seating too crowded and was very noisy with busy lunch hour on a Friday.   Food, not bad, but not particularly special either!  Service was good!</review>

Good Italian restaurant, been going there for several years. It is located in downtown Los Altos, so you could go there after waking around downtown. Their roasted sun dried tomato based dip that they serve with the bread is awesome. The entrees are largely the typical Italian stuff pastas, some steak, etc. I like their arabbiata sauce, I usually ask them to substitute the marinara with that. The place is small and cozy, usually crowded around 7-8:30 even considering the overflow room they have to the side. In summer you can sit outside, gives you a feel of sitting in a restaurant in Italy. Highly recommend!<//Text>

<date>1578138983769<//date><review>I don't frequent downtown Los Altos nor do I eat Italian often, but I'm glad I tried Pompeii. It's one of those fancier restaurants that one would assume is expensive but actually offer reasonable deals on food given the portions and quality (it's also hard not to fill up on the complimentary bread and olive oil and/or butter at the beginning of the meal). For example, I got the personal size margherita pizza, which amounted to six slices or two servings of very cheesy pizza for $13. The pizza crust was a good chewiness and very hot when they brought it out, which I appreciated. The restaurant is in a corner unit and has big windows that wrap around all the walls, so I can imagine it'd offer prime people watching in the day time. Pleasant!</review>< pictures>

Pompeii is a great sit down or takeout restaurant with very good service. Their pizza is good but not thin crust if that's your thing. You should try their meat dishes like lamb or salmon when available.</Text>

Best Lasagna I have had in CA.  We've found out hard to find Italian that compared to Philly/NJ Italian that I grew up eating.

The meat and texture was perfect, the sauce as well.  We'll will be bringing it out of state relatives here definitely.<//review>

I ordered the chicken fettuccine. I found a hair in my pasta (it was not mine) and the chicken was overcooked. I was pretty disappointed in this dish.

My friends ordered pizza which was delicious— not authentic Italian but authentic Italian-american. Really good, bready crust on the pizza.

Service was excellent, very friendly.< /Text>

This is a cute restaurant.  The servers were very nice.  I ordered the tortellini, which was good, though I don't think it's worth nearly $17.  There was complementary bread and dipping sauce.  The sauce was some sort of eggplant-garlic oil.  It was alright.  I definitely would have preferred normal oil and balsamic vinegar, or just butter.  Overall, it was good.  I'm not yearning to visit for a while.</Review>

I had a wonderful gooey and large calzone.  Wife had lamb chops that were just OK.  The chops were small and overcooked, but the dessert of bread pudding made up for it.  I would definitely return with friends.<//text>< Pictures>

Service outstanding, food a little heavy sauces, quite simple. From out of town & those that patron Pompeii must like the simple heavy red sauce. NOT the ITALIAN CUISINE I have experienced w/their prices.</Text>

A disappointing experience. Based off the Google reviews, I expected something much better than a burnt steak with over steamed veggies. The pasta was a bit better but also had a bitter aftertaste.
Service was slow which was surprising since they were nowhere near full capacity. Servers were cordial but moved quickly and brushed you off like you were an annoyance in their daily routine.
Definitely not coming back.< /Text>

<Review>Time after time, Pompeii provides good food and excellent service. The menu is comprised of Italian favorites and seasonal specials- something for everyone. The dining atmosphere is a step up from casual, but isn't stuffy.</Review>< pics>

Great food, wonderful staff.  The Pollo salad was amazingly fresh.  Butternut squash ravioli in brown butter was just the right amount of sweetness.< /review>

Quality of service ..Rushing you to order. My butt was just barely sitting on my chair and I was asked for what the drink. We ordered Chianti, sparkling water and rose in just 5 mins. Omg
Quality of food ... we ordered personalized pizza, steamed clams, carpaccio, pasta with olive oil and Garlic plus side order grilled prawns. Poor presentation, poor taste or lack of.
One of the worse Italian food we had in the last few years.
Never comeback
Never recommend
Please avoid.
What a disappointment,  we went there simply because of online review.<//text>< pictures>

< review>
Pompeii is a nice little Italian place in downtown Los Altos with a casual but slightly upscale small town feel. I typically order the chicken parmesan, which is good (though not great). The service is always friendly and the prices are reasonable, so my wife and go back occasionally with friends since it's close to our home. You can find a couple places with better Italian food in the south bay, but Pompeii is amongst the best.</review>

This is an acceptable restaurant to dine in . The décor is dated, the food is OK, a bit heavy on the fat. Everything is just....ok. But downtown Los Altos is often so crowded that this is a good alternative. Parking is easy.<//review>

I rarely write reviews but my experience yesterday evening led me to write one.  My friend and I arrived around 7:00pm and were easily seated.  Food was really wonderful, salad and pizza along with my wine selection "Rutherford Sauvignon Blanc". The issue ended up being our waiter.  Initially he was friendly and our food came out very quickly, but as time passed by, we got the impression he wanted us to finish up quickly and get out of there. He brought the dessert menu and stopped by about five times to check if we wanted something. It became a little annoying and I told him I would wave him down when we wanted something. His response was he now had a large table to take care of, so basically "good luck with that!"  Hmmm...so we decided to not bother with dessert since it was going to be an issue for him and we put our credit cards on the table as a sign we were ready to pay the bill.  He passed by a couple of times and since we were not in a rush, did not initially mind. After a few minutes I then decided to give him the "pay the bill" signal as he passed by and he quickly stopped and said "I don't have time for that"!  What?  You don't have time?  How rude is that?  So I said to my friend, okay, he doesn't want to take our money, so I guess we will just leave!  We proceeded to put our credit cards away and our coats on and it was then he stopped with the bill. We paid and left. I was really annoyed that we were made to feel that we were a bother. Our dining experience should not have been impacted or altered because of other people this waiter needed to attend to. For this reason alone I will be reluctant to return. Shame as the food and the ambience of this restaurant was really nice.<//Review>

<time>1599111663115< /time><rate>2< /rate><Review>I had an 11:00 appointment to have four tires installed on my 2012 Tundra.  I ordered the tires from Tire Rack, which saved me about $500.  Firestone is an authorized installer for Tire Rack, which is important, because if there is a defect in the tires Tire Rack can blame the installer if there is a problem, otherwise, I'd have gone to a local independent that I trust.  I was told the install would take about 90 minutes. Tire Rack's confirmation included the quote of $80.13 to install the tires, UNLESS I  made a change to the order..  When I got there, I was told the install would be about $22 more because my tires were  "larger than that install quote included."  I went around and around with the guy about how it was between Tire Rack and Firestone, and how it was like a doctor in your network charging you full price even though the doctor had a contract with Blue Cross to charge only X for a certain procedure.  Anyway, I should have griped AFTER my tires were installed because it took 4+ hours to get the tires on.  After killing 2 hours making phone calls, I came into the waiting area to see my truck on the lift, old tires removed, with no one working on it.  I was told my "big tires" required extra effort to install.  I waited 4 hours to get my tires put on--if the local Firestone resents not getting their markup (it would have been about $500), then complain to whoever negotiated the deal with Tire Rack.  Hours I will never get back.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>Highly recommend this place. Great service Juan was super helpful and very honest. Had a great experience for my first time here. Ignore the bad reviews. Great place 10 star rating. Just keep in mind if it’s a big job it’s going to take 1 day or two so don’t expect to get a big job done on a couple of hours.<//review>< pictures>

I called and asked how long it would take to patch a tire and the manager Juan told me an hour or hour and a half . Of course when I show up 15 minutes later they tell me it will take two and a half or 3 hours. Juan claimed he gave me the longer timeframe over the phone, which is a blatant lie. Bait and switch? Or perhaps the timeframe changed when he realized the repair was covered under warranty. Either way, I will not be returning to firestone anytime soon.<//Review>

Hey Juan if you see this just make sure your guys double check if they tighten up the lug nuts on all tires. Had one tire with a loose lug nuts after pick up. Safety issue i say.<//Review>

<text>Took my stock Chevy truck in to have tire's put on. Was told about a hour and a half. 3 hours later they had only done the back. Was told because the tires were so big they were having problems getting the old ones off and new ones on. This is a stock Chevy truck not lifted and has the stock tires. Then was given the excuse that they had to do each wheel separate because they could not lift it on a rack.
Very unhappy I would definitely recommend going somewhere else.</text><rating>1< /rating>< Name>

Literally the worst place to get anything for your car. They’ll keep your car like 6 hours just for an oil change or they’ll have you waiting like 2 hours just to patch a tire. If your running on a time frame this is not the place, go to speed see oils. Oh and the front lobby reaks like dank, some fire tho not gonna lie<//Review>

I went here on a limb, I don't usually go here. I was told I needed more done than I did, and after everything was done, they tried to charge me twice for the parts. I had to find the error. Then after two weeks the product began to rust, I called in, and they told me they would replace it for free (Sounds great right). I made an appointment. When I got there they didn't have my part, and then told me they wouldn't do the service. Then continued to be a smart aleck to me, and talk to me like he was a teenager. I will not be going back here, and will never recommend this place.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Totally disagree with Carle.  Broke down on my way back from vacation on a Sunday, everyone else closed.  Michael was awesome did everything he could. BMW on the otherhand not so great in their response.....
****Update*****. So on the inside of the lift up rear hatch on the X1 there was a BMW Roadside Assistance sticker that said...Need Help? Call BMW 1800 blah blah.... so we figured what the hell we called a lady answered and within 15 minutes BMW had sent a flatbed truck trailer and ordered us an Uber yes that's right I said an Uber to take us from San Martin to Redwood City(about 50 miles). Approximately a half hour later the guy from Firestone called us and told us the flatbed had picked up our car and was driving it to our local dealer in San Mateo.  BMW did really step up in this situation. The guys at Firestone were great. They watched after the car, they called us as soon as it got picked up, I couldn't ask for more.< /text>

<Time>1526701142194<//Time><rate>1<//rate><Text>I went in to the Firestone service center listed above to have a front end alignment done on my '02 Blazer 2WD on the 15th of this month, May under the lifetime warranty program. After an hour I was told they didn't have the necessary shims available to do the job; I would have to come back. So, I call early on the 17th, to see if the shims had been delivered. I was told yes, and set up an appt. for that day at 1pm. Upon arrival, I'm told I owe $45 (I pay for additional parts) for the shims and an additional $80 ($40 x 2hrs., it took just under an hour) for labor to install those shims. Why should I owe an additional labor charge to complete an alignment that is supposedly being done under warranty, when the installation of the shims is part of the process of alignment? I don't know if this is corporate policy or just this particular shop trying to make extra money, but I will never go back to that shop and more than likely, no other Firestone. Period. The whole experience leaves me feeling like this shop practices legalized piracy.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808e1aed877a6561:0x67de5ccf7504b6be< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Quoted 90$/ per tire for two tires, asked them to check a noise in the front.  They were "unable to replicate the noise" - wasted diagnostic fee, oh well, should have gone to the dealer.

Throw in garbage fees, mount, balance, disposal, etc - came to 350.00/2 tires
A big difference from 90/ tire to 175/tire

Will never use again -should have used Pasillas!<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Took in two bikes for overhauls, new tires, brake pads, chains, seats, polishing, truing the rims, adjusting the gears. Bikes ride great. Half the price of other shops and they were ready in 2 days. Alberto is old school and true to his word. What a great fine.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Great little bike shop. Took my bike to get fixed earlier today and it took less than 10 minutes and cost $25 to replace the freewheel. Excellent service at a bargain!</Text>< Name>

Got a lot of work done here on my bike, including replacing 2 tires. One tire was the wrong size + flat the next morning. The other tire's tube is slowly losing air. The replacement breaks were also random old parts.<//review>

<review>Place is koo and small, mechanics are koo, customer service koo Down side they'll reuse spare parts for ur bike and charge u as if its new. Second the people they have just hanging around in the shop feels like a trap house. A clean up and removal of people just chillin also new young help in the bike scene would make a difference and the shop would be great.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I've been here several times and always had great experiences. I recently took a bike frame to another shop and was told that I needed a new frame because the bottom bracket threads were stripped. I brought it here and the owner took his time to slowly and carefully repair the threads and only wanted $10 for about 20 minutes of work. I gave him $25 as he saved me from buying a whole new frame. Great guy.<//text>

I love coming here since i was a child. He's honest & reasonable. He's not trying to get you for your 💰 He's goes by Manny or the local kids call him porky. He's the man than when you where a kid something happen to your bike he will fix it for you. And you where able to pay him when your parents gave you your allowance. I understand he doesn't carry all the infamous brands. But you could do what i do. Buy them online them just have him install them for you. Like i said his prices are honest. Fix a flat hell just charge you the tube. Not for the installation.< /text>

<text>I needed to get my cruiser bike fixed and found this place by word of mouth.  The guy at the shop is friendly and will quote you on the spot and repair right away.  I needed my two tire tubes replaced along with my chain.

2 Tubes = $12
1 Chain = $15
Total = $27

Total time of repair = 15 minutes.

Everything seemed to be great.  Yet, after one day of having gone for a ride in the park, my two tires were flat once again.  I did not go back to Romero's to get them repaired or tell them that their tubes went flat after one day - although I should have.<//text><time>1459726656293</time>< user_id>

Very honest owner. I've been coming here for a few years now even though I have closer bike shops in my area. The prices are cheaper and the owner is very honest. He does the same work for a lot less than the shops around here so I always tip him or give him more. I was quoted $15 for a nut and bolt for handles bars at a local bike shop and he gave it to me for free. I decided to buy all the other stuff I needed from him.</Review>

<Text>I came in as an emergency appointment,they took me in right away and alleviated immediately the pain I was going through. I felt so prioritized and genuinely appreciated the level of professionalism I experienced coming to this office. I live across town and I’ll still remain loyal to their offices regardless of the distance.
The office itself is VERY clean and organized. Everyone working there is very pleasant to speak with and they are very thorough with explaining exactly what is going on. I’ve appreciated their honesty with me and I will definitely continue to be a patient with them.
I also felt 0 discomfort while they were working on my teeth which again I cannot emphasize enough how nice it felt to be prioritized and not rushed to move on to the next patient.<//Text><response>None<//response><pictures>None< /pictures><Name>Destiny Deanda</Name><GmapID>0x80c2dca9ad04e0cf:0xe9c064c9514ce21b<//GmapID><userid>115619427851093456702</userid><time>1617226417516</time>< rate>

<text>This is a great place to go take care of your teeth. The team was very professional examining and providing with solutions by priority. I had to do periodontal root cleaning and Dr. Angela did a great job, I felt that I was in good hands. All the people here were very gentle and kind to me. They explained very well what was going on. Thanks to Dr.Angela, Dr.Mauricio and their financial coordinator Marylou. Highly recommend to anyone!!!< /text>< Pics>

<Time>1609677050980< /Time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>In the midst of COVID, the facility is following and exceeding all mandated requirements for safety. It is clear that the rotating staff is knowledgeable and concerned not only for their safety but for the patients. As a physician, I am uniquely able to appreciate any flaws had there been any.
The Dental professionals at both the Pasadena and Glendale locations rank amongst the best I’ve ever met. Their concern for the “art” of dentistry does not take away from their concern for patient comfort. I don’t believe I would have undergone such extensive work had not the two facilities been perfect in all areas that are important to us.
This is certainly an outstanding group of professionals that I recommend highly and without reserve.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<username>Monica Huerta< /username><Text>I use to dread every time it came to visit the dentist but ever since I’ve come to Dental studio of Pasadena my fear has disappeared. From the second you walk in you are in awe with the beauty of this office. The girls in the front office greet you with such a friendly smile, that it eases all the stress away. The doctors and assistants are all so very friendly, super kind but  most importantly gentle. They answered every question and concernsI had and the dental work is amazing. Very peaceful atmosphere. If you are looking for a new dentist I highly recommend you come visit dental studio of Pasadena. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Dr. Vahik is really an all around great guy.  I recently broke a portion of my front tooth and initially came on for an estimate.  Having moved out to LA to start a new career, I knew it would be a bit before I could afford to fix it.  Vahik did the work free of charge.  It was such a nice thing to do as I work in film and the restaurant industry so I was already feeling damaged.  The practice itself was staffed by professionals.  Everyone there was a delight , warm and engaging.  The first examination to the procedure, I was in , out and comfortable throughout.  I am looking forward to having future work entrusted with their practice</Text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>My name is Ray Miller. I am a recent (1 year) patient of Vahik Meserkhani DDS and have come to be thoroughly impressed with his dental skills and those of his staff. My experience started almost 12 months ago when a Crown done by another dentist came off. It was determined I
needed an implant. After consulting with Dr. Vahik Meserkhani and learning about his career, vast surgical experience and treatment options I elected to have him and his staff perform the procedure.
The extraction process was very involved and required a bone graft before the surgical placement of the implant could be installed. Throughout the months, Dr. Vahik Meserkhani and his excellent staff had me come back several times to check on my healing process. They incorporate the latest dental technology in their practice including full face ex-rays.
It was uncovered during a routine inspection of my bone graft I had an infection in 2 Crowns that needed immediate action. Dr. Vahik Meserkhani and his staff quickly scheduled an appointment and proceeded to complete the work. They even installed ceramic teeth as 'temporaries' versus the 'std' Crown temporary I've experienced on other occasions.
Overall, my entire experience during they 11 months from start to finish on the implant and 2 Crowns was amazing!!!! Vahik Meserkhani, DDS and his staff are wonderful to deal with and
always treated me as #1 anytime in the chair or just at the counter in the office.
Please share my thoughts with other potential clients. They will not be disappointed in the care they received and terrific results they will experience..<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I went for a routine cleaning and ended up seating in a chair for over an hour listening to one sales pitch after another. Even when I was getting my teeth cleaned, they kept asking and pushing for additional X-rays and the upsell Just would not stop.

You would think after I clearly stated that I will think about the recommendations that we would be able to move on. It was like talking to the wall.</text>

This office is amazing! The minute I walked into the office the front desk greeted me with a smile. They sat me within 10 minutes and when Dr Meserkhani saw me he was very informative. I felt comfortable through my whole visit. Thank you everyone!< /text>

<text>Made an appointment for some pain and they were able to see me within a few days. It turned out I needed a lot of work. everyone was really friendly and upfront about what it would cost me out of pocket. The dentists were very knowledgable and showed me exactly what they were doing, it was a great experience!<//text>< Rating>

<review>When I first came to the United States about 25 years ago I was in a rush to find the perfect dentist that could give me the perfect smile for my wedding day. I was happy to find Dr. Meserkhani after being referred to him by family and friends. He is an expert in his field and knows the in's and out's about all things dental. Fast forward 25 years and I was again in need of his services, now for cosmetic and surgical purposes. Dr. Meserkhani performed a bone graft that was practically painless with his magical hands and within a few days I had forgotten all about the pain I had in my mouth and jaw. I recommend him to anyone looking to get the absolute best treatment and amazing results that last! (He also has the most amazing team working for him) Thank you Dr. Meserkhani for your hard work and service!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I have no words to express my extreme gratitude to have been introduced to Dr. Meserkhani by Dally Zuniga after I went to Dental Studio  of Pasadena for a dental check up. I had been suffering from a dental problem since my childhood a condition which affected the quality of the enamel on my teeth. My teeth were enamel deficiency, throughout the years my teeth have gotten more damaged and darkened. L.A. Dentists Group that is located in Glendale who Dr. Meserkhani is the founder of along, with the help of G.I.E dental lab that is owned by Allen Meserkhani Dr. Meserkhanis brother. They have put together a plan for my solution, I started my journey about a month and a half ago; I am amazed with the correcting of my gum line. The provisional crowns look phenomenal!! There Pasadena location is amazing with great customer service that treat you like family. Dr. Meserkhani is a remarkable dentist. I highly recommend this dental studio.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I want to thank Dr Meserkhani, Dr Arbi and the staff for rejuvenating my smile. This office is the absolute best, they are friendly and kind. I use to be self conscious about my smile before I came here. I got veneers crowns and bridges. Lili explained everything in detail, she helped me through the whole process. I'm glad to smile with confidence, my smiles looks amazing! I'm pleased to have found Dr Meserkhani.< /Review>

I have known Dr. Meserkhani from his Glendale practice, and once I found out he expanded his services to a Pasadena office that was open on Saturdays, I was even more thrilled. Being a full-time student, it’s hard to find the time during the week to make an appointment, but now that he’s available Saturdays it makes it easier and more convenient for me to go in for all my dental needs.
Dr. Meserkhani is an extremely talented dentist/prosthodontist and is very delightful to be around! He is currently treating my dad (who has a fairly complicated case to say the least), and throughout the process, Dr. Meserkhani makes an effort to explain to him each step to ensure his understanding of what he’s performing. With the knowledge, experience and expertise Dr. Meserkhani has, I don’t think I’d be comfortable with anyone else treating my dad. He and his staff ensure our comfort is their priority, and we truly value that.</Text>

Dr. Vahik Meserkhani is truly the best prosthodontics I have come across. I am thrilled with his skill, competence, care, and talent. He and his staff are caring and attentive whenever I have a question or concern.  His staff are highly trained professionals. They kept in touch with me and were very punctual about answering questions and returning phone calls. On my first meeting he answered all my questions with enormous patience and kindness. He educated me on every aspect of my procedures in detail, starting from correcting my bite, to my veneers and made sure I was comfortable with every aspect of the procedure. Dr. Vahik actually loves what he does and brings that enthusiasm and perfection with him to each job. His professionalism and knowledge are impeccable and truly amazing. Special thanks to Dr. Arbi Aboolian for his care, knowledge, and competence. It was a pleasure to be worked on by an incredible team. If you are looking for a prosthodontic/ cosmetic dentist who is skilled, compassionate, articulate and very gifted, look no further. Dr. Vahik Meserkhani is the best in southern California. I give my highest recommendation.< /Text>

This place has a 3/5 stars on Yelp...the five stars u see here is obviously a scam.
This place is literally the worst. I don't advise anyone to come get any dental work here. They're very unorganized with appointments and insurance information. People in the front dont know what they are doing nor the dentists. I regret getting my braces done here. They claimed like $1200 from my insurance, but never told me about it and when confronted about it they acted like they had no idea. Also a week after getting a "cleaning and exam", i went to another dentist office to verify their work and turns out they missed an originating cavity. On top of that when my mom went in for a root canal they were trying to work the wrong side of her mouth. If she didnt say anything about what they were about to do she would have had unnecessary work performed. Theres just so much that this place lacks that is what makes me want to never come back. Unfortunately, i started my orthodontics here and im stuck here until im done with my treatment. My advice for anyone looking for a new dentist office to go: DO NOT COME HERE YOU WILL REGRET IT.< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>(Translated by Google) I am honestly very happy with my experience with these dentists. I have been with them for approximately 13 years. 1. I love that they tell me the truth about what I need to get done and not like other dentists who do things you don't need to get money. 2. The things they have done to me have all been done very well. For example, recently, Dr. Angela put two half crowns on two molars and I was very happy because they saved me from having to do something more complicated and, as they say, they saved my teeth! Thanks 🙏🙌
I've been coming to this dentist company for more than 10 years and I love them. They always tell me what I really need to do unlike other dentists that just want to work in your teeth to make money.
Dra. Ángela did 2 half crowns on my molars and I'm very happy how they look and feel. And she saved me from having to do more complicated stuff on my molars so she basically saved them! Thank you 🙏🙌

Service was excellent from the first visit. Quote came within 48 hours as promised via email. I really liked how detailed and easy to read it was. Financing link In email was great, that was a pleasant surprise. They showed up on time and did a terrific job. Install was quick, clean and professional. Mike, who came out originally to do my estimate, called me the next morning to make sure I was happy with the install. A few days later I received care and maintenance instructions via email. All and all, I couldn’t be happier. Product and Customer Service are EXCELLENT!<//text>

It was a pleasure working with Prolawn.  From the first phone call ( they answered right away) and were very informative and scheduled my free in home estimate right away. The salesman/estimator  Alonzo was so professional,on time, knowledgeable,patient and friendly.  The crew who did the prep and install were on time, professionally, efficient and great to work with. most of all I LOVE MY NEW YARD. The turf is better than expected. I would recommend them to all my friends and family. See before and after photos< /Text>

The installation was great and quick. They literally did it in 1 day. For anyone putting in artificial turf near a vinyl fence, there is a high probability for the sun reflecting off the fence and burning away the turf.

Update: I have run into an issue about 3 months after installation with a section of dirt giving way below the turf.

Update 2: They sent someone to repair the section and add wood to help support the dirt.  Thanks!<//review>

<Text>Our grass is amazing. The quality, the color, the look is perfect. Everyone who comes to our house comments on how real it feels and looks. Pro Lawn is very professional from the very start- from the time you call to arrange for an estimate, to the sales professional, then to the install team. They are able to clear explain every part of the process so there are no surprises along the way. I HIGHLY recommend Pro Lawn!</Text>< UserId.>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Hi, I'm Tim. I'm a Retired General Contractor, and I also used to own and operate my own landscape company. And as such, I am pretty picky my home, and how it looks. (The Pictures I Provided Speak For Them Selves, my wife and I do all our own work on our home from painting, laying pavers to landscaping). So due to that, I am generally reluctant to let anyone else work on my home, as I want it to be done right. So when my wife suggested we start looking at artificial turf to replace our beautiful Marathon Sod Yard, due to the severe drought here in So Cal, I was quite hesitant to look at, and trust anyone In that business. As I have seen a lot of really fake looking yards in out neighborhood. And I have heard numerous horror stories of poor installs/workmanship, poor quality turf products, smelly turf due to pets etc. (I have 5 dogs) So I did my research, and set up 5 interviews/quotes with what I considered to be the best 5 prospects based on my research. After all the interviews, I chose to go with Pro Lawn, as Mike Clark their owner was by far the most professional of them all. Let me explain what I mean. 1. He was able to answer all my questions and concerns with facts. (not the other guys, I got a lot of maybes, and I'll have too ask someone else) 2. He was able to show me samples of all the products when he came to the appointment. He was prepared. (the others did not have complete samples) 3. I was able to discuss my whole plan with him, and get his feed back, as not only was he the owner, but he was very experienced in all phases of this type of construction. As he get's his hands dirty doing the work as well. (the other guys were sales people with nothing but a quote, and a desire to get a signed deal that day) 4. We only had 900 sq. feet to do. The other company's said it would take anywhere from 2 to 5 days, depending on how many guys they could send. Mike said they would be done in one day. He would have a four man crew coming. 5. Mike was never pushy in any way. He was very respectful of me and my home and what we were trying to accomplish. So based on those facts, who would you choose??? A no brainer, right. So yes, we choose Pro Lawn. Now I must admit, I was still a little apprehensive regarding the actual install, as I'm letting a group of strangers work on my home. But on the day of the install when the Pro Lawn crew showed up, and I met the foreman and his crew, all my doubts went away. First they were on time. They were dressed professionally for the task at hand. They had all the tool's and materials with them to do the job. They reviewed everything they were going to do and why, and asked for my input. And during the procedure, keep me in the loop 100%. There were no surprises. They were like military operation in their approach. No wasted energy or time. You could tell they really knew what they were doing. Everything they did from the sod removal to the install of the turf was well planned. No guess work. And they really took pride in how and what they were doing. They wanted us to like the results of their craft. They were very impressive to watch. We were amazed to say the least. That was in 2014. Here we are 4 years later, and our lawn still looks amazing. (With 5 Dogs Mind You) No issues. I took these pic's today, 3/3/2018. And yes, I would do it again in a heart beat. Thanks' to  Mike and his amazing team, my home looks amazing. I just got invited to be in the parade of gardens in Clairmont. I have people stop by all the time and take pictures and ask how we take care of the turf. I tell them I only use a blower. Hee Hee. Anyway, I could go on for ever about my wonderful experience. But I think you get the point. We are one happy customer. Tim & Leesa<//Review>< Pics>

I had made the mistake of going with another vendor when I first decided to put in a putting green in my Temecula back yard. I loved the concept and loved it even more when it went in. But within six months it began to fall apart.  The seams were a nightmare, the cups uneven, and it was completely unsuitable for any kind of chipping at all. Finally I decided to do it right and called ProLawn. The quality is amazing. It's like night and day. Putts roll true and fast.  And I can hit flop shots from 30 yards and actually stop them on the green. The service was outstanding both before and after the installation. When I've had questions or concerns, the ProLawn team responds quickly and professionally.  Yes, it was a little more to go with ProLawn. But it was worth every penny.< /review>

Working with Mike and his team was a great experience. We are thrilled with how our project turned out! The entire process was easy and seamless. Mike made some recommendations we hadn't thought of, and his suggestions were on point. The folks at ProLawn Turf are knowledgeable, honest, and responsive. And it is not just us who love the new turf in our backyard - they get a paws up from our 4 dogs as well. I highly recommend!<//Text>

My husband wanted a putting green and we needed artificial turf around our newly built pool. We didn’t have much space for the putting green but they did a great job with 4 holes and slight elevations for challenges. I don’t know very much about golf but my husband does and he is elated. Everyone who has come by compliments our yard. Mike and his team were incredibly professional. Our job was done quickly without any issues. The work was beyond what we hoped for. We recommend this company to everyone.
Thank you again.

Mike Clark and his staff did an amazing transformation of our front yard. We gave him a rough sketch drawing of what we had in mind. He took pictures and measurements and made 3D renderings out of what we had in mind. His crew made our yard look even better than the 3D pictures. Our Yard is definitely a work of art and is by far the best yard in our neighborhood. Mike & his crew are not only professional at what they do but they are all personal with us the customer. Thank you Mike, Mark, & Brandon & the rest of the crew at Pro Lawn

<text>Prolawn was simply amazing! The entire team was extremely hardworking, reliable, and values the customer. We had a tremendous landacaping  job that Mike and his team completed for us. As a military family trust in a new community is invaluable! I would highly recommend ProLawn. Our landscaping project was a water conservation landscaping and irrigation in both front and back yards to remove weeds and add turf, curbing replace with gravel/river rock/shredded bark, with the planting of 20+ new plants, a couple of trees and conversion to the drip line. The project was completed on time, with follow up, excellent materials and workmanship!</text><date>1567344058810<//date><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Pro-Lawn did our backyard putting green and front yard turf and both look very nice. Although the putting green layout was difficult due to many curves in a narrow space, it came out beautiful.<//review>

We have nothing but great things to say about everyone and everything with ProLawn Turf.  From the moment Mike came by to give us a quote, through talking with Kristie at the office and installation by the guys; this has been a most positive experience.  And, we LOVE our putting green!

Thank you for your care, customer service and product.  It makes us proud to be in Temecula!!< /Review>

Service was excellent from the first visit. Quote came within 48 hours as promised via email. I really liked how detailed and easy to read it was. Financing link In email was great, that was a pleasant surprise. They showed up on time and did a terrific job. Install was quick, clean and professional. Mike, who came out originally to do my estimate, called me the next morning to make sure I was happy with the install. A few days later I received care and maintenance instructions via email. All and all, I couldn’t be happier. Product and Customer Service are EXCELLENT!</review>

<review>It was a pleasure working with Prolawn.  From the first phone call ( they answered right away) and were very informative and scheduled my free in home estimate right away. The salesman/estimator  Alonzo was so professional,on time, knowledgeable,patient and friendly.  The crew who did the prep and install were on time, professionally, efficient and great to work with. most of all I LOVE MY NEW YARD. The turf is better than expected. I would recommend them to all my friends and family. See before and after photos< /review>< pics>

<time>1629802627649< /time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>The installation was great and quick. They literally did it in 1 day. For anyone putting in artificial turf near a vinyl fence, there is a high probability for the sun reflecting off the fence and burning away the turf.

Update: I have run into an issue about 3 months after installation with a section of dirt giving way below the turf.

Update 2: They sent someone to repair the section and add wood to help support the dirt.  Thanks!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Our grass is amazing. The quality, the color, the look is perfect. Everyone who comes to our house comments on how real it feels and looks. Pro Lawn is very professional from the very start- from the time you call to arrange for an estimate, to the sales professional, then to the install team. They are able to clear explain every part of the process so there are no surprises along the way. I HIGHLY recommend Pro Lawn!< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Hi, I'm Tim. I'm a Retired General Contractor, and I also used to own and operate my own landscape company. And as such, I am pretty picky my home, and how it looks. (The Pictures I Provided Speak For Them Selves, my wife and I do all our own work on our home from painting, laying pavers to landscaping). So due to that, I am generally reluctant to let anyone else work on my home, as I want it to be done right. So when my wife suggested we start looking at artificial turf to replace our beautiful Marathon Sod Yard, due to the severe drought here in So Cal, I was quite hesitant to look at, and trust anyone In that business. As I have seen a lot of really fake looking yards in out neighborhood. And I have heard numerous horror stories of poor installs/workmanship, poor quality turf products, smelly turf due to pets etc. (I have 5 dogs) So I did my research, and set up 5 interviews/quotes with what I considered to be the best 5 prospects based on my research. After all the interviews, I chose to go with Pro Lawn, as Mike Clark their owner was by far the most professional of them all. Let me explain what I mean. 1. He was able to answer all my questions and concerns with facts. (not the other guys, I got a lot of maybes, and I'll have too ask someone else) 2. He was able to show me samples of all the products when he came to the appointment. He was prepared. (the others did not have complete samples) 3. I was able to discuss my whole plan with him, and get his feed back, as not only was he the owner, but he was very experienced in all phases of this type of construction. As he get's his hands dirty doing the work as well. (the other guys were sales people with nothing but a quote, and a desire to get a signed deal that day) 4. We only had 900 sq. feet to do. The other company's said it would take anywhere from 2 to 5 days, depending on how many guys they could send. Mike said they would be done in one day. He would have a four man crew coming. 5. Mike was never pushy in any way. He was very respectful of me and my home and what we were trying to accomplish. So based on those facts, who would you choose??? A no brainer, right. So yes, we choose Pro Lawn. Now I must admit, I was still a little apprehensive regarding the actual install, as I'm letting a group of strangers work on my home. But on the day of the install when the Pro Lawn crew showed up, and I met the foreman and his crew, all my doubts went away. First they were on time. They were dressed professionally for the task at hand. They had all the tool's and materials with them to do the job. They reviewed everything they were going to do and why, and asked for my input. And during the procedure, keep me in the loop 100%. There were no surprises. They were like military operation in their approach. No wasted energy or time. You could tell they really knew what they were doing. Everything they did from the sod removal to the install of the turf was well planned. No guess work. And they really took pride in how and what they were doing. They wanted us to like the results of their craft. They were very impressive to watch. We were amazed to say the least. That was in 2014. Here we are 4 years later, and our lawn still looks amazing. (With 5 Dogs Mind You) No issues. I took these pic's today, 3/3/2018. And yes, I would do it again in a heart beat. Thanks' to  Mike and his amazing team, my home looks amazing. I just got invited to be in the parade of gardens in Clairmont. I have people stop by all the time and take pictures and ask how we take care of the turf. I tell them I only use a blower. Hee Hee. Anyway, I could go on for ever about my wonderful experience. But I think you get the point. We are one happy customer. Tim & Leesa<//Review>< pics>

<rate>5</rate><Text>I had made the mistake of going with another vendor when I first decided to put in a putting green in my Temecula back yard. I loved the concept and loved it even more when it went in. But within six months it began to fall apart.  The seams were a nightmare, the cups uneven, and it was completely unsuitable for any kind of chipping at all. Finally I decided to do it right and called ProLawn. The quality is amazing. It's like night and day. Putts roll true and fast.  And I can hit flop shots from 30 yards and actually stop them on the green. The service was outstanding both before and after the installation. When I've had questions or concerns, the ProLawn team responds quickly and professionally.  Yes, it was a little more to go with ProLawn. But it was worth every penny.< /Text>< Pics>

Working with Mike and his team was a great experience. We are thrilled with how our project turned out! The entire process was easy and seamless. Mike made some recommendations we hadn't thought of, and his suggestions were on point. The folks at ProLawn Turf are knowledgeable, honest, and responsive. And it is not just us who love the new turf in our backyard - they get a paws up from our 4 dogs as well. I highly recommend!</Text>

This company is fantastic! They are experts in their profession. My husband wanted a putting green and we needed artificial turf around our newly built pool. We didn’t have much space for the putting green but they did a great job with 4 holes and slight elevations for challenges. I don’t know very much about golf but my husband does and he is elated. Everyone who has come by compliments our yard. Mike and his team were incredibly professional. Our job was done quickly without any issues. The work was beyond what we hoped for. We recommend this company to everyone.
Thank you again.

Mike Clark and his staff did an amazing transformation of our front yard. We gave him a rough sketch drawing of what we had in mind. He took pictures and measurements and made 3D renderings out of what we had in mind. His crew made our yard look even better than the 3D pictures. Our Yard is definitely a work of art and is by far the best yard in our neighborhood. Mike & his crew are not only professional at what they do but they are all personal with us the customer. Thank you Mike, Mark, & Brandon & the rest of the crew at Pro Lawn

Prolawn was simply amazing! The entire team was extremely hardworking, reliable, and values the customer. We had a tremendous landacaping  job that Mike and his team completed for us. As a military family trust in a new community is invaluable! I would highly recommend ProLawn. Our landscaping project was a water conservation landscaping and irrigation in both front and back yards to remove weeds and add turf, curbing replace with gravel/river rock/shredded bark, with the planting of 20+ new plants, a couple of trees and conversion to the drip line. The project was completed on time, with follow up, excellent materials and workmanship!</Review>

Pro-Lawn did our backyard putting green and front yard turf and both look very nice. Although the putting green layout was difficult due to many curves in a narrow space, it came out beautiful.< /Text>

I received robocalls that this company will be at my house without my permission as well as unwarranted bills without any explanation or date of services, all which appeared to be a scam. I have not signed any contract with this business. I was frightened by a person coming onto my property without written or verbal permission. This person was calling me with "urgent" messages rudely telling me to give him my code to enter my property further. I called my previous pest control service who I paid in a timely manner and I have all receipts. I was then told that my information was sold to this business. I was not given any notice of this. I have asked for no contact with Clark Pest however they continue to send me bills, 3 so far. I do not owe them money. I find them unprofessional and inconsiderate.< /text>

Customer service is excellent, friendly and responsive. However, I have had them over twice now and still have lots of pest problems. I actually went to Home Depot and purchased 8 ant repellent traps to help because they never went away. Additionally, we have seen more spiders (and very large) this summer than we can ever remember seeing in the past. I will still use them because I am (hoping/assuming) they are doing a little something, but not enough to rate them 5 stars.<//review>

Professional, nice service people come to spray once a quarter. No bugs. It's working! Much better than when I moved in two years ago - had a home invasion of ants back then. Happy customer here!</Review>

<Text>We love Clark Pest Control! Their service is always prompt and the technicians are friendly, professional, and educational. They go above and beyond to clear up any problems we have (and there are lots of problems with our older home that no one took care of for years on the outskirts of town!). We highly recommend Clark!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I called when my dog caught a mouse in our kitchen and Tim came out the next day. He set up several traps, sprayed outside and said he would come back to monitor them. He is so kind, especially to my 70 lb bully. Murphy knows that when Tim comes he is getting doggy treats! The mice and bugs are GONE and Tim never misses an appointment. I definitely recommend Clark, you won’t be disappointed!< /text>

No follow up, does not provide services as initially stated, but sends invoices charging for services they have not performed. I  signed up in August for rodents in my attic they came for 2 days: to clean cobwebs and spray exterior and to set traps in attic in August. Have not seen or heard from Clark but the rodents continue to have fun. Finally,  called yesterday to request follow up, scheduled an appointment for this morning from 10 to 12 PM, no show or call.</Text>

Reason we called Clark was because of mice getting in the closet wall.  One year later, mice are still in the wall.  Problem not fixed.  They are nice to come and remove the mouse when it is caught and reset the trap!</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>In late May, my daughter requested a quote online from Clark Pest Control and within a
couple days Josh, from Clark, was at my door. He was very friendly & personable with my puppy & my (adult) child gamer.
I was happy with the quote I got, it was a lot less than I expected and he was very patient trying to read my card info to the main office. We got scheduled for our 1st service in the beginning of June. It was the earliest I could fit it in and it was the LONGEST WEEK EVER! Ants, ANTS & more ANTS. We tried to fight them ourselves for a couple months but unlike previous years, NOTHING worked.
After seeing the results only 2 days after Clark treated our house, my family & I wondered why we waited so long. Adam showed up on the day & time I picked and was just as friendly and easy going as the 1st person. I couldn't have asked for better service.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

< review>
Bugs are back a week after spraying.  They told me the bugs would survive in cool moist places so I asked...Why did you not spray under the house (we have a raised foundation)? That is the largest moist and cool place on my property but they had no good reason.  Instead they came back and sprayed the same places as before.  I suppose I could have guessed the good reasons, 1) Too dirty  2) Too hard  3) Too cramped.  The termite guys got under there looking for business why could'nt you.  So if you want bugs coming back a week after spraying CALL CLARK PEST CONTROL.< /review>

FYI:  This is a drive-thru location
Unique offerings and everything I’ve tried has been delicious.  I was disappointed that they don’t offer soy milk, but I have been loving their oat milk lattes.<//Review>

I have eaten at the restaurant on Churn Creek and at the express location in Shasta Lake. I have NEVER been disappointed!! In fact, I told the chef at the Churn Creek location that I was pretty sure they have a 5-star chef cooking in the back! The food has always been excellent! I love their coffee as well! I would recommend any of their locations for a fantastic-tasting meal for a fantastic price!!! The people working there are always very friendly and helpful! I eat there often and will continue to eat there!! Their Turkey Mulligatawny soup is the best soup I have ever eaten! I even got my very picky mother to try it and she loves it as well!  Keep up the excellent food!!!< /Text>

<Review>Stopped here on our way through from San Diego to Seattle. Amazing small town shop with double drive through windows and excellent service. They have everything on the menu from smoothies to burritos and desserts. Such a warm welcome and they wanted to make sure we had everything we needed to continue our trek including a refill on water bottles and a biscuit for our pup. Highly recommend for anyone in the Shasta Lake area or anyone making their way through for that matter.<//Review><user_name>Taylor Bates< /user_name>< Response>

The staff at this shop are absolutely the sweetest! I come back to this location for that reason alone. The coffee is good black, but if you can try one of their suggested specials I would recommend it. I have never had a bad one yet. Their blended drinks are more to my liking in that they taste fresher and less syrupy than Dutch Bros, Dunkin, and Java. They just aren't as over poweringly sweet and I appreciate that. I recommend their mocha. The chunky monkey (If I have the name correct) with coffee in it is my favorite blended drink thus far. They also have had amazing gluten free brownies offered here, so nice of them to have that option. The Kids choices are also awesome. I would highly recommend this drive thru coffee shop!<//Text>

<text>This is such a terrible place. They dont even fill up the cup of water half way for the fish. They look so dead an sad. I really hope someone shuts them down for such careless actions ! You can go see it for yourselfs. An when I went to purchase some because I felt bad for them the cashier put them in bags as if they were a regular store bought item with no life. I would advise not going this place Is terrible!! 0 stars in my book!<//text><Rating>1</Rating><Time>1560098205560< /Time><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcd87e1c194037:0xeca237c914a369f4<//gmap_id>< user_id>

The park is missing their main attraction, Water in the park. Without water throughout the park, the park seems boring and less authentic.  It appears that it has been broken since 2019 and there are no signs that they are working on repairing it. You pay $6 to park . The park is very small.  There is a public restroom.  The restroom is not very clean. It's a good place for a short walk.</Text>

<text>Nice free park, great bones, good features. Currently under construction so most of the ponds are dry and some areas are blocked off. They have some great plants here, one of my favorites was the cedar Grove. You can't beat the price for a nice relaxing stroll but if you are looking for gardens taken to the next level, check out Hakone gardens.<//text>< Date>

Nice landscape and pretty big koi pond. Could have been 4-star if they didn’t drain some of the ponds. Not sure it’s temporary or permanent.</review>

During the pandemic, no tickets are required.  But there is no water in the pond (carps are also concentrated in a small pond), so children can play, but this will not affect our appreciation of autumn leaves.  The Japanese style in the garden is great and worth a visit.  The yellow leaves on the door are also great!  This is a great place to take pictures!<//Text>

Free entering. Beautiful place with beautiful nature! Everything around is green, trees are blossoming, interesting sculptures here and there. Friendly squirrels, waiting for treats, birds, not scared of people at all!

The only thing which could be better - if it would fully functional during Covid time. Many dry pools and only one of them working and I heard so much about multi colored fish!

Love this place, it's history, beauty...peaceful and relaxing!🥰🥰💗💗💗💗🥰🥰 They may be remodeling or something, because when we went, we saw a drained pond. We were a little late getting there recently when we saw the one pond, because they were closed. We've been going here for years. It's a very tranquil place to be. Enjoy it, be respectful of others in their personal, quiet time, and enjoy the scenery!!💗💗💗💗< /text>

<Review>Honestly to say that this garden has many more elements than majority of the US parks. Koi, Ducks, Goose; Lake, Lawn, Bridges, Trees, Hills; also of course some Japanese style building. The garden size is relatively small, but it is really colorful. It is a great place to take some great photos! Kelly Park is just steps away and if you have more than 1 hour to spend...< /Review>< pics>

This is a nice place to visit with young kids during COVID. Not a lot of people in the garden in the morning. We spent 1.5 hours with two kids in the garden and the kids didn’t get bored. There are places to sit and rest and have a mini picnic. It’s also good for picture taking to get some fall color. Plus no admission fee. Highly recommend!</Review>

<Time>1606697882850</Time><rating>5</rating><Text>Relaxing and pretty place for families of all sorts to come and enjoy. This park is from San Jose's sister city, Okayama-Shi, located in Japan, and everything in here preserves the Japanese serenity and traditional beauty.
What's not beautiful are some Instagram girls and wannabes who come here and hog the small walkways so they can take 470 pictures of themselves under the changing leaves.
Insider tip, parking and entrance are free during Covid, so there are plenty of people visiting this place. The best autumn leaves Kodak moments were between Nov 19-26. Don't forget to walk around the surrounding park and Happy Hallow if you have the time.</Text>< pictures>

<text>I am a Japanese enthusiast and was very excited to visit the garden. We came all the way from DC and were surprised to see the lake dry and the koi fish was in a small dirty pond you cannot even see them. The experience was extremely disappointing. On another note the staff were really friendly.</text>< Date>

Free and not busy, but also not great. Almost all of the water is drained and will be until 2022 they say. But beyond that, it doesn't feel like a Japanese garden - a few Japanese elements are scattered among a lot of normal California park plants. The Japanese garden in San Mateo, although smaller, is significantly better.<//review>

The ranger there (I think his name starts with an A?) is the friendliest! He gave us so many fun facts about the park that we would have never known, like the history, design, symbolism, etc. It’s a shame how nice and beautiful the gardens could be, but the city stopped funding the park years ago, so it’s pretty meager :(<//review></record></dataset><record>

Beautifully terraformed a great place to explore and relax in. In some parts you can be disturbed by the noisy road nearby and the ponds should be refilled soon. Still a great place to come for peace and quiet.</text>

Very neat park. It's under alot of repair from the 2017 Guadalupe flood so the 2 main ponds are in disarray. The upper right pond has lots of koi and a cool heron. But it's a nice change of pace and there were very few people there so distancing was no problem.</review>

<Review>Nice place with family. Quite different with other places. This Garden made you feel calm, relax, and more enjoyable. Good location next to Happy hollow and Kelly park. But no more water in the pool, or it will be more beautiful.</Review><Time>1555951462839< /Time>< response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Amazing place. It's quite big too compared to the other Japanese garden in the Bay area. They have a big koi pond with lots of fish and a lot of other trees and flowering plants. This is a must visit place If you are looking for a relaxing place around the Bay area. They also have a big picnic area for get together. Only concern is the parking which is $6 on regular days and $10 on holidays</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6UxxcI-R4BPx5LIoNcjP8PyI4Q4pomisVJZyv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0jb3fAY6YkqT4TFos9hiDbptoTA4EPnuVD-VG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN14F9PYFihRXwp2Cfluj_nPs2ptvVgLgEuLhef=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVDkKZCHSiUqZaoc1K2o9wcRn4HDsspoTe5H0B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzjdx1FwTBUBXkkMuergArhjBRr3c1WtNuNRi8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzIvbDeO5XYEMfIW1iIbrn2nWi3gKDMGOsFOfp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpghI96Fy2qi-UzvDoUDNo-egYFMt3G-jmPPLv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgYuG7O031HPcHBD9FiY0Dyw-ZKHgsnSkCtoqY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWU7P4zfACCGekELJCpZlKhLUMIGrLf_WNcNW2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNw6b85T3_VzFDnH4d1A4gtlhIc8ZLPU5UVeKgu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeG-ji9rswgeCdA7lxDw-zuLSzqySMm-4ZCfzd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8SyXByIEJuOtDvetISrEJ75hBbc_6wKsrKYTC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhg1V6rklO83cewEzB8ssP_3GXH4OGZfZXmzBw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiuHrwF8hDca0e3W8pdbqArA40Ma58yQ-evlsZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcn_9aCERQqL3dfrcpAz0KbzLHvMvRh-4fhU-Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOC_mLk7sunsHZiEzE4F_hsfw1vojtR3KMi9Vmg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGecuraN--XwtfCRm-iQpXjpA4S_r4I7hQGv9n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdCg0-EEQmB_1dbxW9fMVxUgQlr7KIA8D9Ynv6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>under repair and restoration right now. Still kinda cool to walk around the drained lower ponds. Be sure to go to the upped pond to see the dozens of giant Koi, probably 40+ yers old.</review>< pictures>

It was absolutely gorgeous. It was unfortunate that most of the pond areas were closed for restoration and the koi were all in the farthest possible pond, and obviously things were closed down a bit further for COVID, but it was VERY lovely, fantastic greenery, the statues were sublime.<//review>

<review>It's a nice garden. Plenty of shade to relax in. I like to see some of the trees which have been uniquely shaped to give that Japanese look.

I don't know why most of the ponds were dry except for the one upper pond where the koi were. Maybe because it is winter time, or they are under construction? But if all the many ponds and channels were filled with water, this place would be really beautiful.</Text>

Beautiful formal gardens with lots of walking paths. Probably would have given 5 stars, except their ponds were shut down for renovation. You could tell that the garden would be spectacular with the ponds reflecting the lovely foliage. Nearby parking is $6.< /text>

There bridge was closed because of restoration after the flood, and one of the ponds was mostly drained. Regardless, it was a very beautiful place. It cost $6 to park all-day ($10 for holidays), but well worth it!</text>

<text>It's a beautiful place but is a shame they don't remodel it. There are lots of things that need fixing. The pond is dry so, apparently locals want the pond to be restored and the koy fish back in it. You pay for parking. Don't know how much, my friend pay for it.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNX8UQIKiSJVKnxjJV2PcKU_YIG09iNwDrKHB3-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNat0yjia9rIkD2kC4rQlXojkk6ff4OHaR260oc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_pGh8eSCQeUUJa6IprTfmnhWHtwd1zApEDi_b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLKSExcB_W56zor2brGxkNpEitkmazlHE3Bk35=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnjfE39EMLvTuKK7LcS4Mu_dQyiJ1O5S6T-A5D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_u_FAx-zca42ZMxDgsXaCIvN0w5NxOXcUv0Rj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObXiXsJ957QwsbOn2OwOyi_WvAmW7iYW0qY59b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4b9lr_Ko9sa-e_EEgLxxfwSr4753g-Kq7FBWB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNG2LTfhnrxI81flYMFHUuwN-WTK_wUvGaU7Kcl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1W0wUai8CYKHrbxfMdixbYJlAQHDNd-PjctcL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxNr9g4MPuvKWQiOglfMmW4O6OQZw3MAPsrtpB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBFhNY9syAS2TU39PbO3naRtFcPY1tAag7E_GZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYUvBmi0gtTw1BYBEADorzOjDihnGl_PHDojUy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808e332c3c96029f:0x9963851067f38f63<//gmapID></record>

This garden is in disrepair right now. All of the ponds are drained except for one and that one was very dirty. There are some pretty trees and foliage. Can be fun to stroll around in but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit.< /Text>

There aren't many flowers but there are many trees and other plants. It's still beautiful but would look better with more flowers. The paths are nice, but some of the ponds had no water in them at the time.  It could look so much better with some more maintenance.<//review>

<review>Place is beautiful.  Love the variety of trees.  Some pretty tall trees.  The water was not flowing through out and they were some of the water ways without water.  Can't enjoy with children all they want to do is complain.  Would of given it 5 stars if the whole area was functional.< /review><rating>3<//rating>< Gmap_id>

<text>Very pretty place, still recovering from flood damage, but continues to be open to the public. When I was here there were  a lot of prom pictures being taken, it was cute to see the dresses and the dates all cute and stuff. Everyone was friendly, and took turns getting the great shots, even those of us who weren't there for prom photos.< /text></record>

Quiet. Lovely. Great place for a walking meditation. Stroll along the ponds or over the bridge to a beautiful little island with a bench that’s waiting just for you. Feed the koi or the geese. Hug the giant trees! Plenty of parking and adjacent to the historic center. Plenty of space outside of the garden for a picnic or a game of frisbee.</Text>

Was once a beautiful Oasis in a concrete city but now it's luscious koi-filled ponds are dry and people are rudely walking in them despite the clear signs not to. Didn't know when or why it happened or even for how much longer as I searched the grounds for any informational signs, but there were none to be found. Only a small dirty yet-covered pond on the north end contains these beautiful koi. The grounds were still very green and manicured. Avoid until the ponds are back.< /text>

I visited this place after seeing some photos in Google maps. But it was not updated about the repair of large ponds. they were under repair and water was removed. the fish were removed to upper ponds. Anyhow a beautiful and attractive place with Japanese landscape. Many Japanese have come with their kids.
The caretakers of the garden were very friendly and explained about the fish. Some ducks and goose were hanging around without fear. I managed to feed some of them by my hand.< /review>

Cute place to walk and take in some nature away from the concrete jungles and traffic. The flood a few years back caused some of the waterfalls and koi ponds to be outta service but hopefully they will restore them soon!</review>

<Time>1581211915696< /Time><username>Ami & Joe</username><review>Beautiful landscaping, but the tea house is under construction and the koi have been isolated to a small pond at the back while the main ponds are all drained and awaiting restoration. Still, there were plenty of people walking the grounds, having picnics, and feeding the fish (bring food!). Hoping that 2020 brings the garden back to life - it would be great to it in all its glory!< /review><user_id>114566189336190479397<//user_id>< Rating>

Right in the middle of San Jose, at Kelly Park is another world, The Japanese Friendship Garden.
This is a place of peace & beauty. Here you can commune with nature.
I bring all of my grandchildren here. Once through is not enough. We bring a lunch, feed the Koy then navigate all the many paths, climb all the rocks, sit on all the benches & cross all the bridges a second time before we can leave.</Text>

<text>I went here with lot  of expectation of seeing koi fishes and the beautiful Japanese ponds. I was disappointed to not find any water 💧but I gave 3 stars for maintenance of gardens and the greenery. I did a mistake by paying for electric scooter which was parked outside garden but only to find that it doesn't work and the money is just lost. Entrance to this is free but car parking needs payment for which there are machines. We need to put the paid slip on car dashboard else car will get towed. Not many people were there when I visited<//text>< Gmap_id>

I wish it had been better kept up. There is one koi pond remaining,  which is worth it, but the rest of the ponds are empty. Still there is beautiful trees and flowers.<//text>

<Name>Mark Cigler<//Name><Date>1600663161400< /Date><Rating>5</Rating><review>The Japanese Friendship Garden
with its diverse landscapes, tall
trees and comforting grass areas
invites young and old families to
relax and explore. Some families set up easy tents just for the day.
Restrooms and tables are open,
BBQs are not.
You will see; birds, turtles, coy, and
and so much more. Amazing
japanese landscapes in San Jose?
Yes it is vivid and true. Visit once
and you will never forget what has
been experienced. Awesome, clean
and very friendly. There is a
peaceful resident crane that moves
elegantly and will fill you with
wonder. Leave a dollar or more in
donation "fountain".</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Took my granddaughters there it was their first visit to the Japanese Friendship Garden. They enjoyed walking around. At this time only one pond is filled with water, the larger ponds are dry. We saw a colorful turtle and even though the water was cloudy we could see the koi fish. I was a little disappointed, but the girls enjoyed themselves.<//Text>< pictures>

Nice but when we went 75% were under heavy construction. Parking is not free and some homeless wander around. It is small. You can do the whole park in 30 minutes if you walk at a normal pace.

Edit: I went back in August 2018 ( more than 10 months later ). No water, barely anything to see, nothing advertise the bad conditions. I even saw a broom with her wedding dress in the parking lots who was about to get desappointed. It is not worth it at all. Always under maintenance. Also, a lot of animal feeces in the sidewalk.</Review>

It’s pretty cool but a few issues:
1.) The pond is in horrific condition as far as algae goes.
2.) This is the big one, YOU CAN’T BRING YOUR BIKE IN. I was yelled at for WALKING my bike through here. They don’t have any bike racks for you to chain it up outside either. I get that the paths are small but this makes it not friendly at all to locals.
3.) Parking is $10 (if you drive) yet given the condition of the pond and lack of bike racks, where is money going???<//review>

Upon arrival at the Japanese Friendship Garden I quickly realized that there is little to be friends with aside from the concrete. All the pools are drained and devoid of koi. One can only pray that they are still alive... Somewhere. In solidarity I lay my body prone on the gravel floor of the ponds where they once swam so freely. Good plants and vegetation though, I got a few good tree hugs in. It's also fun to gallop on all fours down the dry ravines where the fish and water lilies once fliurished.<//Text>

Even though it was clearly posted and frown upon, some people strolled through the green areas and were also smoking.</text>< pics>

I'm glad I didn't have to pay to park. There's construction everywhere and no fish or ponds.

According to a gentleman that I spoke to over 3 years ago the ponds flooded and they have yet to replace the fish or fill the ponds.  Such a waste because I could see how pretty this park could have been.</Review>

It's a nice little park to stroll for an escape from all the traffic in San Jose. There is a $6 parking fee that's very inexpensive for the nice scenery. However, today the pond is emptied, however, if you continue further into the park, you'll find a pond on the highest point where all the kois are at. Looks like the pond being emptied is a temporary thing.</text>

This park is just okay.  If I was going on my own, I wouldn't pick this place.  For the parking fee, I didn't see anything worth seeing.  The Japanese bridge is good but there was no water underneath.  The ponds were all dry.  The koi ponds could be better maintained; the water wasn't clear (and I don't mean to be crystal clear of course).

They do however have some trees that turn color in late November (that's the usual time forb fall foliage in this part of the country).<//Text>

<Review>Notably, parking is $10. It is nice, and if you stay the entire day and go to the nearby petting zoo, it might be worth it, but kind of a bummer if you were just looking for a casual place to relax one day. Very pretty though. And if you still play Pokemon Go, there are a lot of stops to spin.< /Review><user_id>103283970845307368125</user_id><rating>3<//rating>< response>

You can feed the koi fish for 25¢! They are huge! Careful with the ducks. They steal all the food. -_-< /Review>

I decided to do the Explorer Pass for my day at Balboa Park which cost $48 and included five museums/exhibits. I chose the Japanese Friendship Garden as one of my “museums.” It’s the only garden that cost money to see but it’s really so beautiful! If I was a local, I would probably go there every day just to sit and be at one with nature. It was pretty quiet when I visited so it’s definitely a nice spot to relax and also take nice photographs without anyone getting in your shot. It’s such a peaceful place with great energy and beautiful greenery.<//Text>

It's beautiful if the ponds were full that's the only reason I give it a 3... the ponds were completely empty throughout the entire garden which is basically the whole point of going. There was one small pond open that had a bunch of coy fish.< /text>

The ponds are undergoing reconstruction (i visited late Sept '19). They have relocated the Koi to one pond. Although it would be more interesting if all the ponds had water in them it's still a nice place to walk. Some of the paths are steep. There is a restroom located just outside one of the entry ways.< /text>

<review>A very nice Japanese Garden in San Jose. While not as big as Golden Gate Park it does contain a lot of the elements of a classical Japanese garden.  Have visited several times and will return in future. It is a recommended stop while in San Jose. Please note that there is parking outside but it is is paid parking.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< time>

<Review>This was once one of my favorite places to visit in San Jose. At one time I would even argue that this was a better place to visit than the one in SF. At this point though it's not really worth even stopping at. Two thirds of the ponds have been dry for years. Yes, I understand this was a result of the sewage flood thanks to San Jose not being able to handle a little rain. I also understand this area wastes money on plenty of things that aren't as important to me, and we are talking several years now.

As bad as all that is, today was the final straw  At some point they taped a sign over their hours to close at 4PM. We didn't realize it until the ranger locked my girlfriend and I in. Some shouted, be we weren't able to understand exactly what was said.  We started walking to the gate to see what was going on, instead we only found it locked. In our escape planning we ran into another couple that was trapped as well.  I guess luckily for all of us the fence is in a similar state of disrepair to the ponds since we were a le to find a bald spot in the barbed wire to make a break for it.</Review><response>None< /response>< name>

Pretty park but the larger ponds are drained. One at the top with koi isn't but reading some of the months old reviews seem to indicate the drainage isn't temporary.< /text>

Beautiful area yet 2/3 koi ponds have been out of service and empty since a 2017 flood killed the pumps and according to posted signage, there is no timeline to fix the ponds. It's a shame a beautiful place like this can't get ANY corporate donors from the numerous companies in the area (some of whom have plenty to give away!) to help fix up the ponds and support maintenance costs.< /text>

Park was good. You can see ducks and Koi fishes. But the larger Koi ponds were empty. All the fishes were placed in one pond at the top. Apparently the filter systems for larger pond is broken since San Jose flooded a couple years back.</Review>

<review>Nice, small downtown park. Can be busy on weekends. $6 to park but entrance is free. We I went 4/13/19 the ponds and water features were being worked on so it wasn’t as pretty as I’ve seen it in the past. Takes about 30mins to slowly walk around.<//review><UserId.>114724554027294361522<//UserId.>< Time>

This park is incredibly beautiful despite visiting it during construction and during drought. We walked the park for about 30-40 minutes I believe in the spring heat and enjoyed it very much. We saw a lot of koi fishes swimming in one pond and to my personal surprise they had provided shade using smaller tents - taking care of the animals, big plus! It feels very peaceful and calming to walk this park and enjoy the beauty. As a foreigner I enjoyed this a lot because I had never been to the US before and felt like I was in another country, inside of the US. It was rather magical. I believe the park is truly beautiful during it's peak with the water and the fish swimming around, and I hope to return one day. My only complaint is the lack of water, which might have been stated somewhere, but I am not completely sure.< /Review>

The pump is broken so all the water has been drained.  There are, obviously, no koi or turtles.<//Text>

<review>I’m rating this more on the potential than the experience itself. We had a multi-family mid-October visit to this attraction per a local recommendation, and other than a few coy in the upper pond this place was dead (eg no staff present, most attractions drained, ...). The parking was $10/vehicle, but the saving grace was that the attraction was free. I’m sure it’s all about timing, and would possible reconsider a visit during the late spring/summer to see if it was more hospitable and worthy of the drive.< /review>< Pictures>

Took family photos here recently. Seems to have gone downhill and could use some TLC. The lake is empty and the park is looking a little bare.< /review>

It's a pretty park but the dry lakes let it down. It seems that they are awaiting repair and have been for some time. In this condition, I wouldn't recommend going out of the way to visit but I'm sure that it will be worth it once repairs are complete.< /review>

<Review>Their is major work being done, but that kinda makes it more magical! I've been going here since the early 90's as a kid, and it is just breathtaking. Spralling Japanese paths give options to wander over different horizons to discover neat coves or benches to pause and reflect across the water. Or let the vast number of Koi lead you along a journey around their shores. All ages seem to love it here.< /Review><userid>103510455434574217462</userid>< Date>

<Review>The place is big, a person can explore the garden for hours. It's quiet and serene. People can bring food, sit on the benches, and eat. The only thing I didn't like is 2 of their ponds were dry, no water. It would have been great and beautiful.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

It's good but they need to refill some pools and fix some areas so that it's more up to par.  It has potential to be better if some work is put in.</text>

Beautiful and serene.  A gift from the city of Okayama in Japan during the early 60s.   A rare gem in San Jose, 6.5 acres and you will be transported to a thoughtful place where you are encouraged to be in the moment and relax.  Although the City is repairing the ponds from the flood 2.5 years ago still, the garden is still a haven for animals and beauty.  No fee to enter, parking is about $6 in Senter/Alma lot, and $10 in the lot next to Happy Hollow, free parking if you drive around the stadium area if it's not crowded.  Hours are generally 10am to 5pm, but maybe later - check the website.< /review>

The garden is completely run down. I had not been here for at least 10 years since 2000's. It's used to be a great well maintained garden. Not anymore!  However, the koi pond is under some major renovation and completely drained. So there's hope!<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>This Japanese Garden is in Kelly Park San Jose. Park is around 6 acres, established in 1965` Entrance to the park is free. However there is a $10 fee for parking. You can also find free street parking near by. Great location for photo shoots or just relax in the garden. Garden has three ponds. Pond under the bridge is Koi pond.

This garden got affected by flood in San Jose, couple of years ago. Now restoration is going on in the garden specially Koi pond. Now the Koi pond is dry, Koi fish are moved to another pond in the garden. Now fund raising in progress to restore the garden.

In spite of this it is still a nice place to visit in San Jose.<//Text>< pics>

The park is great for a stroll. When we visited some of the ponds were empty. Beware of the geese poop everywhere!<//review>

The park is beautiful. Sadly the flood left the koi fishes water ways a mess and they are secluded to one portion but they are gorgeous and a sight to see. Definitely will come back.</Review>

<Text>This was a really cute place for an afternoon! Parking is $10, but if you politely ask someone for their pass on their way out, 9 times out of 10 someone will give it to you. Also bring lots of quarters, there’s a machine for koi fish food and it takes quarters. They get really rambunctious when you have food and it’s adorable.</Text><Name>Kat<//Name><rating>5<//rating>< pics>

Beautiful,peaceful place to take a walk. Great photo opps. Ducks, geese and other birds also. Best time to visit is likely in Spring when everything is in full bloom. We visited in late January and it was still lovely but not as colorful as I am sure it is in the Spring.< /review>

<Review>Great works of artistic scenery, creating a relaxing and calming atmosphere, with every carefully placed rock, tree, bridge... just an amazing place to visit.

Just one thing, I do not really recommend coming during the winter, but in the spring, when the flowers blossom, this is your go - to place if you can't find things to do.</Review>< Pictures>

Sit, chat, play, cook, eat.

Beautiful place down the happy hallow zoo park.

Nice place to bring kids and have the play.

Toilets available.

Nice place to spend time with family or friends.

Everything looks Japanese.< /text>

Unkept grounds. Drained ponds. Not what was expected. Hours online starting that they are open until 8 PM after Memorial Day are apparently incorrect and they make multiple announcements at 6:45 PM telling you to leave the park because they are closing. It’s important to have correct hours for visitors.< /Review>

Japanese Friendship Garden is a great place to relax. The garden is huge, so it is very easy to find a place you can be alone and meditate. Once you finish your meditation, the koi will be ready for their lunch.

There is a tea house, but it has never been open when I am there.<//Review>

I think they're doing some sort of remodeling or repiping. Most of the water features are drained and the one or two that aren't are stagnant and dirty. I'm sure it's a lovely park when fully functioning but at the moment I wouldn't say it's worth your time.<//review>

Most of the pools were drained, so the garden had abandoned look and feel.
It's probably nicer in the summer without rain.< /text>

The trails were pleasant and the area was quiet, but most of the ponds were empty and things are under construction. Will be fun to visit again in the summer.<//Text>

Their ponds are empty except for one. Poor fish is crowded in one place. Their water system broke during 2017 flood and there is no date in sight of fixing it. Sad. These ponds were the main attraction. Oh well....</review>

Normally a very nice place with running water and plenty of koi fish in the pond. Looks like they are renovating and the place looks like construction site right now. Hopefully they will be done soon and its better then before., usually 4-5 stars, right now 2-3 stars.</Review>

A peaceful place to walk around even with the pond issues. Hope they are able to raise the necessary funds to revive it.</Text>

<review>I looked like it once was beautiful, but do to a recent flood, they let the place go dry in some ponds, and sluggy in another ponset of ponds. The tea House was closed. All power sockets didn't work either. It's basically a small stroll with a few cute bridges at this point.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808e332c3c96029f:0x9963851067f38f63</GmapID></record>

<Text>This is a fairly large friendship garden with a lot to see. There are plenty of places to sit and watch the pond or greenery, and it's good for couples, friends, or families. It doesn't have the authenticity or grandeur of some other Japanese Gardens (eg: the one in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park), but this one is free, so that explains some of the trade-offs. I would appreciate a tea house or other shop being open in the park (It looked like there may have been one that was closed?), but it's great in its current form too.<//Text>< Resp>

Parts of the park is still under renovation from the floods, so some places are closed off to public. Other than that, it was a nice park! The koi pond area was quite peaceful and pretty! Entrance is free, but you have to pay for parking.<//review>

Cute and peaceful park with a Japanese touch.  Nice place to spend an hour if you enjoy strolling and sitting.

Adorable Koi and little coin-op machines with food for them if you'd like to.  Cool little tea house that seems like it's available for events.< /Review>

Drove in from out of town and paid $10 for parking just to see nothing but empty ponds. There was only a very small section with water and fish in it. The rest is all dried up. They should at least have a sign that says there's no water in park.< /text>

It's pretty... but it isn't too big.  The main attraction is probably the beautiful red bridge.

From there you can walk around and maybe feed cool gigantic koi fish and some of the ducks.  There are little vending machines you can get fish food from.

Parking is I think $7<//review>

I think, they have fund problem. Not much of fish and duck in pond. Since it is Japanese park. I was under the impression that there would be lot of bonsai and  special trees in the garden. I could not find any difference between other parks and this one. Not very good place. Not worth visiting this place.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>Nicely maintained set of formal Japanese Gardens, with lots of fish to spot and little streams to walk over.  Lots of shade to stay out of the sun if you want to, but plenty of places to bask [if you feel like risking the wrath of the Geese - in October!].

The only downside for me, was that the obviously constructed nature of the Gardens was pretty obvious (concrete channels, edging etc) and this detracted somewhat from the 'natural' experience.<//review><Name>Donald Clark</Name>< gmap_id>

The park needs a lot work done to it. I went today and the large pond that has a red bridge is totally empty.

If you want to see the Koi fish you will need to go to the upper pond to see them. The pond it self is very small.

The tea house was also closed today.</Review>

Beautiful garden that stands out from the rest of San Jose. Bridges, ponds, geese, and even koi fish that you're allowed to feed. I'd definitely recommend this area if you're looking for a place to relax with a book or with a date.< /text>

Nice place to take pictures and to take a stroll. A bit crowded to relax and read a book. There's coin operated food machines to feed fishes.<//review>

Opening time says 10 but it didn't open until about 1040. Hope everything will be OK after the issues they had with floods. Hope the fish will be ok from now on.</review>

<time>1376686988123<//time><review>Saw big and little koi fish today.  Koi fish food available for a quarter from a machine -- don't feed them anything else!  Lovely park for watching water running and taking in the serene design.

But no picnicking allowed within this park.  You have to go outside and there are plenty of grass and picnic tables right behind this park.  Signs say to keep off grass, which is a bit sad given this is a park.  Might be a hassle with little ones as they just run anywhere.

Unfortunately the beautiful design is marred by cheap looking chain fences on the perimeter.< /review><resp>None<//resp><user_id>110223448783380710704<//user_id><Rate>4<//Rate>< Pictures>

I felt like the garden is a little small thou. I walked around it twice. I love the pond in the middle with koi fishes. Bring a lot of quarters so you can buy food for these fishes. They are soooo pretty!!

We and other people took pictures (with our face in the photo) without a problem. I think you only need the permit if you bring those professional giant camera to do some kind of a photoshoot. Other than that, family, friends pictures are fine.</text>< Pictures>

Wouldn't recommend it. Only things there are two koi ponds and a coin rotation. The ponds are dry and the coin rotation was out of order. Also, there were a lot of areas blocked off.<//text>

Huge disappointment. All the koi in one small pond. Nothing else in bloom. Looked like Japan in late fall though we went in the spring.</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I went there in September, but most of the water in the pond was dead without any people. There were trees that were common in Japan like maple leaves, and there were also unique plants that I wouldn't see in Japan. It's a pity that the teahouse was closed, but I think there are some scenery that can be seen only in this season.

(Original)
九月に行ったが、人も居らず池のほとんどの水が枯れていた。もみじの様な日本でありふれた樹木もあれば、日本では見ないだろうと思うユニークな植物も見れた。ティーハウスが閉まっていたのは残念だが、今の季節だからこそ見れる景色もあると思います。< /Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) San Jose’s Japantown may not be as famous as San Francisco, but it is also listed as the only remaining Japantown in the United States with San Francisco Japantown and Los Angeles Little Tokyo. Just north of SJ downtown, a few small blocks, some run down, but hidden authentic Japanese, Japanese supermarkets, a legendary handmade tofu shop (175 Jackson St, San Jose, CA 95112) and a simple Atmospheric Japanese temple San Jose Buddhist Church Betsuin. There are Farmers Market on Sunday morning, and you can take a chance to visit Japantown.

(Original)
圣何塞的日本城可能不如三番的有名，却和三番日本城、洛杉矶小东京并列为美国现在仅存的三座Japantown。就在SJ downtown以北，小小的几个block，有些破败，却藏着地道日料、日本超市，有家很传奇的手工豆腐店（175 Jackson St, San Jose, CA 95112）还有一座古朴大气的日本寺庙San Jose Buddhist Church Betsuin。周日上午有Farmers Market哦，可以趁机逛逛日本城。<//review>

Мне понравилось, но хотелось бы увидеть более чистый пруд. И хотелось бы чтобы рядом с автоматом по продаже корма для рыбок был автомат по размену денег на четвертаки!</Review>< pics>
