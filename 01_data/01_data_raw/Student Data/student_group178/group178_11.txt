Very friendly staff. Clean facilities . Feel safe when I go there by myself after the office is closed. Rates are on the money versus size of the unit.<//review>

<text>Contemplating but more towards saying yes to Ceres Self Storage. They have reasonable prices and even have p.o. boxes available. Sounds like a company that tries to stand out and offer services and products that go beyond what you would normally expect.< /text>< Rate>

Nice facility and easy to access.  Staff has changed quite a bit and have increased our rent 2x in the last year and half without notice. Some staff members rude. Price is reasonable.<//Review>

I have been with Ceres Self Storage for 5 years now and have no reason to leave...

Why would I want all this stuff in my Garage LOL :)

With the Amazing Customer Service that they give especially Joseph.

They are always very helpful and courteous and that's not easy to find...

Thanks Ceres Self Storage :)</text>

About a year and a half ago, our unit was burglarized, nothing of to much of importance was taken, but the storage manager,  upgraded us from a 5x10 to a 10x10 at da cost of a 5x10. N as long as we continue to rent from them they have guaranteed our space will remain da price of a 10x10. They have gone above and beyond for us. And we are very appreciative to them. Recommend to anyone in search of a storage facility!<//text>

We have been with Ceres Self Storage for over 10 years and I have found them to be outstanding.  Joe who is the manager is one of the best person to work with you.  He makes every thing as comfortable as he can.  He goes out of his way to make things happen.  A truck to move, always checks on you while in the facilities and even lends a hand with unloading, loading and squaring out your unit.  I would be stupid to go any where else.

THANK YOU CERES SELF STORAGE and of course JOE!!!<//review>

THEY TREAT YOU RIGHT AT FIRST...THEN THEY TREAT YOU LIKE TRASH WHEN YOU DECIDE TO MOVE YOURE STUFF. THEY DON'T COMMUNICATE BETWEEN MANAGEMENT AND OTHER EMPLOYEES. THEY GET MAD WHEN YOU LEAVE THE UNITS BEING RENTED. MANAGER HAS NO PROFESSIONAL SKILLS AND I WON'T EVER EVER RENT A STORAGE THERE. POOR MANAGEMNT SKILLS, STAFF SOMETIMES FRIENDLY. SOMETIMES NO...
THEY GAVE YOU A GOOD DEAL THEN PRICES GO UP THE SKY. IT'S ALL ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND HERE THEY DON'T KNOW WHATS THAT. THEY NEED TO IMPROVE TO KEEP CUSTOMERS HAPPY NOT MAD.

I recommend Ceres Self Storage to anyone out there

Joseph, the manager of the storage site, is very professional, nice, understanding, and absolutely willing to work with you in any way he can.

They had a move in special for a unit for $32 with no contract, and took $5 off putting a card on file, and even had a free move in truck.

I am currently starting over, and didnt have alot of money to move, and he went out of his way to show up the day I needed the move in van so I had more time to get moved and put my things into the unit. He even offered to help me unload my stuff.

People like Joseph are the last of the few people out there that take pride in customer service and believes that word of mouth referrals are just as important as online specials. We all know its a storage unit company, but doesnt mean you cant take pride in helping people and use it as an excuse.

I will refer anyone and everyone that needs a storage unit to this place from now on, not only due to the good rates, but also because of Joseph and his service. Hes an asset to Ceres Self Storage and your customer service base.<//text>

<review>Be careful of Josh. The supervisor always wearing Black with glasses on. He never has his mask on though and takes it off and on. Today May 24th, I made a complaint why my package was delivered since May 20th by ups and there's a prove online that it was delivered and signed by Donald around 10am, but they didn't hand it over to me with other packages. Josh the supervisor on glasses with black hair was rude and arrogant. Made me feel so embarrassed in front of everyone like I didn't know what I was saying. Told me to call ups and ask for a transfer tracking number and even more embarrassed because ups never has that information. I went home without my package and this is like the 5th time it is happening.  Painful part is I regret renewing my 6 months subscription with them. They don't deserve it, because they are not happy with themselves and their job and treat people badly</review>< time>

< Review>
Customer service is terrible. I arrived at the location and the gentleman at the counter was not helpful at all. I explained that I had moved to Claremont and I filled out the card in the mailbox with details of the names of the homeowners in that mailbox. Two weeks have passed since and any mail coming to our new home has not arrived , even mail we know was sent out a week or two before. I addressed that and he just told me my address did not exist. Next the Supervisor Josh ( wearing a casual non post office shirt ) was standing by hearing the complete conversation and could tell I was frustrated and I asked him to intervene. He pretty much told me to contact my previous post office regardless of the fact that it was for mail being delivered at the new address. I asked for a Supervisor or post master and he gave me a wrong number. I left the post master a few messages Louis Ramirez and he is yet to contact me and I still have no mail< /Review>

<user_name>Laffi-Taffi Huggins<//user_name><Text>On Sat., 11/28, I mailed a box to my grandchildren. Paid $51 for 2-Day Priority. The box arrived to its destination on Fri., 12/4. I went back to the office this past Saturday to get a refund because I feel I was overcharged.  The young tall, black haired Manager with glasses informed me that they only guarantee delivery for Express mail only.  The rest of the services like 2-day or 3 day Priority are Not guaranteed. If that’s the case, Why Are You Offering the Service!!!!!

Word of advice, don’t waste your money like I did!  This used to be my favorite post office.
Not only that for the past 3 yrs when the postal service was having difficulty competing with the online service, I went out of my way to support them.
Not Anymore!  I’m done supporting them.< /Text><Rate>1<//Rate>< user>

<Review>They sure love to make up their hours as they go. They don’t notify people of these changes. You just have to go and find out. Oh! They decided to not do 24hr lobby service like your contract states. Oh! They decide to close early on Christmas Eve with ZERO notice. No signs. Nothing. Just closed. Even their holiday posting shows no differences on Christmas Eve. Just Christmas Day. So that’s super awesome. I love paying for a service that they decide they don’t want to honor.<//Review>< Pics>

Absolute worst customer service I’ve had in a very long time.  I don’t know if Clerk 23 was having a bad day, but don’t take out your frustration on the customers.  Every time I asked for something he sighed as if he was annoyed.< /Text>

Absolutely worst customer service I was told when something weighed more than the shipping label stated to leave. when I asked how do I fix it or pay the difference I was told its to much work for them and given back my package. Under no circumstances should anyone ever do business here. I would prefer a day at the DMV then any duration of time at this location.</Review>

Extremely awful. They do not scan your packages, so don't expect them to know where things are when you ship through them. They also do not actually pick-up when you schedule a pick-up and simply just say they did it. They also do not pick-up the phone. The times they do pick-up, they are rude and you have to call at least 5 times before they pick-up. Rude when you drop off in person too. Have filed at least 3 complaints and nothing ever changes!< /text>

Delivery is getting slower and slower. Never arrives before 5 in the evening. Mail is delayed. Supposed to get a certified letter on Thursday that I have to sign for, it’s Monday and still have not received it. Called them and was told it was a hour wait time to hold. Guess I have to go in person tomorrow morning. Wish me luck!</review>

The management at the La Verne Post Office is not focused on the customer at all! I paid over $80 for Premium Mail Forwarding for three weeks. When the first week of mail had not arrived, I contacted the PO. The frontline person tried to help but had to pass me on to her manager. I was on hold for 45 minutes, waiting for the manager, Jose, to finish "writing a report." After hanging up and calling back, I was told he would call me, which he never did. Two days later, I called again. He referred me to someone else, who said he would call me back, but never did.
Finally, by getting another post office involved (where my mail was supposed to be forwarded to), I learned that the carrier had never been given the paperwork for the Premium Mail Forwarding. By then, they had missed the first two weeks of my three weeks of forwarding. It remains to be seen whether I will ever get that forwarded mail.< /review>

I agree with the many other reviewers that most staff are exceptionally rude and uncooperative. This is based on a number is instances, not just one. One time, we had an express delivery of birds (live birds) from east coast. The birds arrived at the post office after 2 days, they called me to pick up the box from them while I was at work. I told them that they are supposed to deliver to my home address, and I cannot come anyway because I am at work till 5. They said, "we do not deliver live animals", which it totally against post office rules since we received birds before on other occasions. To make a long story short, I had to call 4-5 times, talk to 3-4 different folks and managers... and finally someone showed "kindness" and decided to make a delivery attempt. All the time, we were worried to death that the birds would die there in the box. This is a blatant violation of post office rule. And to top, they were extremely rude on the phone and to my wife when she went there in person to try to pick up, and then they refused to give to her since the box was on my name. She literally came back home crying because of their extremely rude behavior.

Update: Sept '20 - A few of their staff are really nice to the customers.<//Text>

The BEST Post Office - Considerate, Friendly and Prompt!

I can't fathom why so many low ratings for this wonderful group of people at the La Verne Post Office. Granted, we all have individual experiences, but I have to say that, for my particular experience, they are THE BEST! Headed by Manager, Alise, they are very friendly, very helpful and will go the extra mile to be of help. Without hesitation, I give Alise and her great staff 5+ stars out of 5!</Text>

If I could I would put zero stars. The management is very weak and do not care about the customers whatsoever.
The employees are very rude, and when talked to, only answer with an immense amount of attitude.
I had an appointment, but when I asked about it, they only responded with attitude.<//review>

<text>Horrible customer service!!!
Mail is lost!
I purchased a P.O. box and completed a change of address in February, but yet I still haven't recieved mail to this day May 1st, 2019. (Except "our neighbor")junk mail, including mail from another address. To begin, I spoke with multiple people from La Verne post office who insisted there was nothing I could do to get my mail, I just had to wait it out. So when mid march rolls around I continue to ask questions about why I don't have any mail and filled out my 3rd change of address form and submitted it. After this I realized that something is definitely wrong and I take it upon myself to call customer care, they advise me to speak with the "post office clerk" said that this person is in charge of incoming mail to the boxes. I waited in like to ask for this person and was very rudely greeted (for the 2nd time ) by a lady with green hair who asked me "which box?" I told her and she proceeded to make the comment "That's funny cause that box sure has been getting a lot of mail!"
My jaw dropped in disbelief!! ... as you can imagine considering I hadn't received anything but junk mail at this point, she wasn't in charge of boxes and I had already spoken to her and to other clerks in her presence about the LACK of mail I'd been recieving.. after speaking with the po clerk, she was also unable to help me. I spoke with the Pomona post office manager, where my mail was forwarding from. I've decided to close my La Verne box, cancel my change of address and move everything down to that post office. The service, sense of urgency and over all ability to help is much better with the workers at the POMONA post office.
La Verne should be shut down if they're unable to keep a standard level of service. I wish I could give 0 stars.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c32fb5c0061ffb:0xbe84b88be99003f7<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Yesterday I complained to the postal supervisor about the atrocious incompetence of the mail carrier in Claremont for Courier Place Apartments. In 2018 the following were seen in my Informed delivery but never arrived in my mail box  A letter from USCIS about my citizenship, the paycheck before Xmas, Xmas cards from overseas returned to sender, a VISA card, and a valuable letter that came registed to the correct address but which was returned to sender as undeliverable before the mail carrier even left the post office where he picks up the mail!  Today an expensive wallet i ordered from Bootbarn was, according to the tracking, deposited in my mail slot....except it was not there.... AGAIN the mail carrier put it in a neighbors slot and they took it. I may or may not be able to find this, depending on the honesty of whoever took it out their slot!  So I am asking the La Verne post office this..if you cannot deliver my mail can i please have a free PO Box at Claremont Post office? Or can you hold my mail there permanently so i can pick it up myself? I am unable to use my mailing address in future. This is beyond ridiculous.<//text>

<text>As stated by others, the service is terrible. Not all of the attendants are rude but the majority seem as if you are bothering them by being there. Lastly, the hours are terrible especially if you are an individual that works full time. The post office hours are the normal working hours of a full time individual. So much for serving the public. If I can avoid going to this location, I definitely will.<//text><username>Stephen Farrar<//username><time>1505700683327< /time><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

Went to the P.O. in la verne to send a package overnight for my 91 yr old Dad, I asked the clerk 2 times, since I have a forwarding address & has not been stopped yet because it's going to take 7 days to cancel, would there be a problem getting some important mail to him, she told me there should Not be a problem... well you guessed it folks It was, I spent $23.75 to have an important package that would guarantee my Dad would receive his package ... I've had nothing but the runaround by everyone there pointing fingers of whose fault it was, And they claim the clerk knew the rules, anf i must have worded it differently... i Would Not have spent 23.75 If they could not do it, and have FedEx it, which I have used several times And no problems...Now they refuse to refund or give me back what is due me for a service that their All knowing clerk screwed up on but was quick to take my money... Does anyone know what/who on higher power  (other than God) I can contact? Please advise... never have I been so disrespected like that!!! If there was a star below a 1 ...< /Text>

No wonder USPS is going out of business! They have horrible customer service skills. They act like you're inconveniencing them. I was at the La Verne location trying to get a passport. I showed up early filled out the forms, only to be told that I needed an appointment. Of course, they don't mention that anywhere on the website, or that location. I tried calling the phone number for the post office and guess what? No one picks up! How exactly am I suppose to make an appointment?</Text>

The customer service is horrible. The guy helping me was talking to his coworkers while I stood in line while he was helping others. He motioned for me to come to the counter to help me but that was the only interaction because he kept talking to his coworker. It was just really bad. I don't need to talk to you but I don't need to hear about your weekend with your coworker either.<//Review>

<Review>I am used to going to the San Dimas post office for shipping packages to my brother over seas, and I decided to go to the La Verne post office because it is closer but they had horrible service. We walked in and they glared at us as if we were interrupting them. At the San Dimas Post Office they usually fill in the mailing information for us because it's a complicated address but the La Verne Post Office repetitively told us no we can't do it for you which I was fine with ;however, I asked for help on the paper because the address had no street address or what a normal home address would have because it is military. They told me to just put the street address which I clerified did not have and they did not listen and told me to put the information. I put the information on the shipping paper and gave them it ,but they told me we can't ship this at all and continued to say that. But i asked why is it the San Dimas post office can send it but not La Verne and they only said they can't and got all the employees to tell us they can't. I am never coming back to this post office with the attitude and experience I had from the employees.</Review><user>109961826585701606844< /user>< date>

<Text>I tried to call asking a quick question regarding the passport.  If they don't have anyone or time to come to the phone why don't just say so. Instead, they put me on hold for hour.  Their phone number is useless  and the workers are rude particularly the woman who handles the passport application.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c32fb5c0061ffb:0xbe84b88be99003f7</gmapID></record>

"No one is available to take your call." (click) This, in the middle of a work day. THIS, after being disconnected and dropped from two 800 numbers. We have missing mail and missed deliveries for days on end. No one cares one stinking bit. PLEASE go out of business soon!<//Text>

I have mailed things out from this post office for years, every time it seems as if there is a delay in the process. Recently I have mailed out vehicle registrations for 2 separate cars, one placed in the drop box and one handed to an employee,  and now I have received notices from the DMV for incomplete registration. THANK YOU for the late fees.</Text>

When I told him the same thing happened a month ago and now it happened again.  He said "I can give you a phone number for complaining".

<Text>I walk in with 5 cards to mail,  1 has a giftcard so I send it certified so I can track it. The 4 cards with a stamp arrive in 3-4 days, even the one being mailed across the United States.
The card mailed certified that was scheduled to arrive in 3 days?....well, 7 days later it's "between facilities ". This is why the antiquated postal service with it's apathetic employees is deteriorating into oblivion.<//Text>< Pics>

I am so glad I did. I ordered the house special chow mein and beef broccoli. I didn't know this but you get a free order of white rice when you spend a certain amount. Anyway, the smell coming from the bags was so good. My mouth was watering the entire time I was driving. When I got home the food was hot, fresh, and oh so good! The broccoli still had a bite to it as it should when it is cooked correctly, and the shrimp in the house chow mein were huge. The white rice was tender and fluffy. The noodles were big and soft. I will definitely be back soon.< /review>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Visited this afternoon and despite being posted on their website- they DO NOT have lemon chicken. The very rude female staff we spoke with said they hadn't had lemon chicken in over 3 years. Gee...they might want to update their online menu. Absolutely the last time we visit this establishment. We previously visited over 2 years ago and they/she were very rude then as well. We'll stick with local restaurants such as Dragon Express. While they do not have lemon chicken either- they never advertised that they did. And the staff are friendly and welcoming. I'd also vote national chain Panda Express better than LA Chinese Express.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c25793f6238cd1:0x5839dbb0569aa670</Gmap_id></record>

Im putting a one because I can't put a 0
My husband brought me this food and when I opened up the rice I was like wth this rice is soaked in oil. It tasted like it was cooked in old oil. The noodles were stale and the beef broccoli was soaked in soy sauce . Maybe some people like their Chinese food like that but nope that is not tasty!<//review>

Good customer service!  Food has always been tasty. Me and my husband always come here for the food on the way to our road trips!

The food is authentic, china town style food. big portions, friendly staff! Try the Mongolian beef or Chicken chow mein. Flavorful and did i mention the portions are amazing.< /Review>

<Review>Came with the family for the lunch special as advertised. It was super hot in there. No a.c.! We  where ready to place an order then lady said sorry it's not lunch special anymore! According to the menu lunch was over at 330p and it was 2p. She said that's only Monday - Friday. Although on menu its DAILY!! She said sorry we are changing menu next month. Thats wrong on so many levels! I don't recommend this place.< /Review>< pics>

Her food is amazing but her attitude sucks. She immediately takes offense to any request you have for the food. If it’s anything extra or emoting anything she starts yelling and threatening you not to come back.

She hates the fact that people make any request and that’s exactly why she doesn’t have as much business as the other food companies around her.< /review>

Ann was very helpful in explaining the difference between hong kong style and taiwanese dishes on the phone. I was confused on some of the dishes name and she helped me some very delicious noodle dishes that me and my wife enjoyed last night! Thanks Ann!< /Text>

Bad temper service. I brought my senior grandma to eat here and a chair was dirty so she used a napkin from the table and the Asian lady started screaming at her saying not to use the napkins for that in a rude way. She should had cleaned it her self instead or had been appreciative. Won't come back and I don't recommend this place.</review>

<Text>Tasty Food! Get the Mongolian beef, you wll be stoked how flavorful the sauce is. And the portions was huge! OMG, no other chinese places around here can even compare. Ann was very nice and courteous and asked if i wanted double rice, since the portions was so large. Will come here again soon!< /Text>< Rate>

Horrible customer service!! Cannot order for delivery, would not take our order.. Said that she would not take order for take out and to go order at the location. Very rude as lady. She really needs to change up her attitude and not rush people when even trying to order. Have been here before but now I will be taking my business else where..<//Review>

Great wines but absolutely horrible service! 1) there was miscommunication between the employees and they let it out frustration on us. Very awkward and terrible start of a supposedly enjoyable wine tasting experience 2) their service felt a bit intimidating with an overwhelming amount of details and history about their wines & Napa, rather than giving us the space and time needed to enjoy ourselves. 3) they kept stressing about “spoiling” us with more wine and more exclusive wine which felt again very pressured. Will not revisit or recommend to others.</text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>This was my second time here and will probably be the last time I bring anyone here.  Let me just give a recap on what took place the first time and the major difference this time around.

The first time, I went with my co-workers on a Wednesday in November. We had Amy and Travis who were both personable and wonderful to talk to. They were both knowledgeable and they made us felt welcome. Both gave us sufficient time to taste the wine. I was the DD so two of my co-workers drank. We called ahead to ensure we can have a picnic as they do the wine tasting. All was well and my coworker liked the experience so much we ordered a bottle to be split between the two of them. When we left I loved it so much I made sure to remember this place to try again when my family visits.

The second time was a dismal experience or should I say it was a total nightmare. Mind you, we went on a Saturday this time but we kept that in mind and didn't plan to overstay our hour and a half limit. I can't even recall the name of the person we had since it was such a sad experience.

1) When we arrive the person  (Domenico) helping lead us to the yard where the tasting was going to take place. We requested to sit under the Wisteria since we were the first one there and no one else was there. We were literally the first party. Well, that didn't happen because he told us it was reserved. Fine. If it's reserve we can't do much but lo and behold it wasn't at all. The next party of two came in and they requested the table and they received it. First strike. It was a matter of principles at this point.

2) Our party of 4 was seated near the doors. As we sat down I reminded him that only 3 out of the 4 will do the tasting. Something that I mentioned prior when we were filling out paper works. As I was setting up our Charcuterie board he came over and said "Don't focus on that, you should focus on the tasting first. You shouldn't eat anything before tasting."  Mind you, I was not doing a tasting so I should've been free to set this up while my party did the tasting which I told him as he was now rushing us. Second strike. I get it. You drink certain wine with certain food. I'm no pro but that much I understand. The fact that he kept rushing us to taste the wine was a huge no for me. You want to enjoy your experience tasting the wine not chugging it down.

3) It was wine chugging/rushing, not wine tasting as my family later deemed it. After the first wine, he came back and kept trying to get us to try the next one already even before my family finished the first tasting. My husband who greatly enjoyed the wine was by now done with the experience. We were allotted an hour and a half but it felt like he wanted us out 30 minutes in.

4) My husband and mom enjoyed the Maximus so they ordered a bottle but yet again you would think they would let us enjoy the bottle with an hour left. Nope. We basically felt rush to finish it. Which in turn resulting in not enjoying the wine yet again.

Overall the experience was night and day compared to my first time there. I know that it is a Saturday and they are probably booked up but why would they assume we were going to overstay our time or that me setting up our food will deter them off schedule. I am not tasting at all. There are three people who are they weren't helping me set up so why would you rush us.  Safe to say it was a total waste of $130+ for such an experience. I will not be going back and I will definitely not recommend this winery to anyone I know.

Choose a winery that actually wants you to be their guest rather than just another number. Next time I will try a different winery or stick close to home. We live in the Tri-valley and are surrounded by local wineries. I had such a wonderful first experience there I wanted to share it with my family but it was truly disappointing. I felt so awful leaving there.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
My wife and our 2 sons visited this winery this past Saturday for tasting.

Before being able to do a tasting, I was asked to sign a lengthy legal liability release document requiring me to "accept sole responsibility for any injury to myself, including, but not limited to, personal injury, illness, disability, death, damage, loss, claim, liability, or expense, of any kind, that I may experience or incur in connection with my visit or participation in wine tasting at Bennett Lane Winery" and further "forfeit all right to bring any and all claims against Bennett Lane Winery for any reason."

I have never encountered such a thing in a winery or other food establishment. When I refused to sign this document, we were told that we would not be served and were asked to leave.<//Review>

Another great tasting room visit. Donna was superb as always.
We started with the Maximus, which is phenomenal and went through the list. Malbec is very tasty with hints of cherry, the 2013 cabernet has a dark cherry and dusty finish, the 2009 cabernet has bing cherry, cocoa and a sturdy and elegant finish. These wines will compliment any meal.<//Text>

We had a private tour that took us through the grapes all the way into the barrel room.  After the tour, they set up a private pergola with a photographer to capture the proposal.  She couldn't be more surprised.  Ask for Donna, she did the tour and set the whole thing up. Can't give it enough stars.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>The place was good but comparing it to other places it could be better. The wine is good for tasting with food, pretty good for a blend and excellent for the price but is not the finest wine.

Other wineries focused on talking about their soil (terroir), their history and the quality of the harvest and they abstained from describing the wine. I like this because it lets you have your own non-influenced tasting experience with the wine while knowing how it was made. In Bennett Lane they talked about what the critics have said about them and they also described the flavors of the wine. This could be nice for people learning how to taste wine but it could be better if they talked about their history and processes.

The staff is friendly and pretty casual.<//Text>< pictures>

What a wonderful experience! The view is spectacular and the service incredible. Peter was so gracious and accommodating. We arrived at the end of a day of tasting - which plan we will reverse on our next trip. Wish we were there right now. Thank you.< /Review>

About 8 years ago I went to a wine store in Nap and ask if they had Opus One which they did not but the owner said, "if you ever get a chance go up to Bennett Lane, I like it better."  After 8 years I finally got there and it is well worth the trip.< /Text><pics>None< /pics></record>

Excellent ambiance, great location, tranquil space in the backyard. The wine is awesome!!! I cannot stress this enough. My 4 stars is because of the appointment policy, which many wineries in Napa are adapting. I am not a fan of this policy, as who has time these days to call ahead of time to a winery to see if they have space. What happened with the spontaneity of just showing up to one of these places and be taken aback by the quality of the wine. They did accomodate us yesterday when we showed up at around 4:20 pm, and the staff was quite friendly.</Text>

Came from out of town to taste Maximus, which we always buy for our cellar but were turned away by staff because she thought they were too busy, even though there was plenty of room at the tasting room bar... We used to be club members and always buy a case or 2...bad business practice!

We had not heard of this winery however it was recommended by our innkeeper. It was totally worth the visit. Alise was very friendly and informative. I especially liked the maximus and the malbec. Both of which found their way home with me along with a couple of others. This winery should be on your list when you're in Calistoga.</text>

Very nice, small vineyard with excellent wines. Chris was very courteous and knowledgeable. They even refunded the charges for our son who was under 21 and did not participate in the tasting. We enjoyed the Chardonnay, Cab, Merlot and Maximus.<//text>

Use the same nail filers that has been used on someone else. That’s a big no for me. Salon gets packed pretty fast. Not the friendliest service and a bit overpriced in my opinion. The best past about pedicure was the massage which lasted good 5 minutes. They don’t accept tips on credit card which is a bummer. Jeannie is an amazing person to get your services with.</Review>

<Text>Wanted to preface this review by saying that Lilly does an excellent job with pedicures. However, due to the customer service from my manicurist I am not comfortable coming back. The picture shows the end product of my manicure.

I scheduled an appointment and had a couple of pictures that I wanted to show beforehand of what I wanted. It has been a year since I have been able to afford getting my nails done and I was super excited to get something special. I must have done something right off the bat to make her not like me? Not only did my manicurist not look at the pictures, she rolled her eyes when I brought them back out when she was asking about Colors. She stared at me saying she didnt understand what I wanted and I tried to be polite to explain, but she refused to look at photos and kept cutting me off when I was explaining myself. I really try not to burden people and would have preferred her to actually look at what I wanted in the beginning and say that she wasnt able to do something beyond one basic color Nd one glitter nail. At the end, she had me look at my nails and asked if they were what I wanted. Again trying to be polite I said they were ok, didnt want to hurt her feelings. She LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY. Honestly, the shape of the nail was lumpy and the manicure French tips werent straight.  I was embarrassed how my nails looked but did not want to cause a scene or ruin the experience for other women that were enjoying their pedicures.

I paid cash and the cashier took my money and gave change and walked away SO fast I couldn't even ask to tip Lilly for being pleasant and doing a good job on my pedicure.

Overall I'm so bummed because I was expecting a good experience and to have fun getting my nails done and I instead I felt mocked and that I was a burden for them. I would never recommend getting nails done here. I drove straight to Lotus Beauty Salon to have these nails removed and redone. They went above and beyond to squeeze me into their schedule, Kim so friendly and got to know me, learned my name, she helped me find the perfect colors, shaped my nails perfectly and I am so excited to go back to Lotus Beauty Salon because I know she will remember me. Go to Lotus Beauty Salon.<//Text><Rate>1</Rate></record>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>The best one so far in the area. They get busy very quickly so it’s best to call ahead and book an appointment. Ask for Leslie or Ann - they do a good job with acrylic full -set and gel polish. Michelle and Katie know a good foot rub. Ask for Jeannie - she is pretty accommodating if you really want to squeeze in a quick visit.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>I am giving them some chances from few of my last visits that may be next time they will do better but disappointed now totally seems they don’t have any trained staff for Shellac Mani and Pedi and then they will explain you that it was really a right way so after few times I can be more sure that it’s just waste of money as they don’t want to improve too.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Set up an appointment here for my girlfriend for her birthday and asked if they could do anything special for her. Was really impressed. They got her flowers, a card and really great service.

Really did not expect them to go as above and beyond as they did. Plus she really liked the job they did. Hard to beat that!<//text>

The ladies here are meticulous and kind, and aren't chatting away about you "behind your back!" What are the odds?

I came here for the first time with a friend and was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness, organization, and detail. It's a little pricier than what I'd normally pay for a gel mani, regular pedi, but well-worth the timeliness and quality.

Will definitely be coming back!< /Text>

I won't get into detail but if there is a caregiver that is ihss certified please add your name to a list so we can find some one that wants to work and not hard but enough to earn your pay .

The office moved to the first floor.  Suite 168.  The main entrance from the parking lot get you to the 2nd floor so, you will have to go downstairs via stairs or elevator.  There's always someone there to assist you when you enter the office.  They will ask you what you're here for and will give you a token.  I suggest getting there early in the morning or getting there after lunch time (around 1pm).  Otherwise, it can get busy here.  They do, however, come by to ask anyone who was just there to drop off the forms, which can make the waiting time shorter if you are just there to turn in the completed forms.    Thursdays are when orientations are usually held so, good luck finding the parking spot.</text>

At first i was mad in how long i waited for a vet rep then found out they offer the space as a favior.  The vet rep was worth the wait. Some of the pest customer experince after the wait.  Def recoment the wait.  Old police officer coukd have a more aprocable facel expression but all in all super thankfull they offer there space to disable vets.. thank you<//text>

They call you and hang up, they don’t let the phone ring so it makes it seem like you have a missed call. I was called back to back and didn’t get the chance to answer because they hang up. I can’t even call them back. And this is the 2nd day that my medication hasn’t been delivered. I would rather walk or drive somewhere to ensure that I get what I need. I would rather do extra work or extra traveling than use this service. And then they always answer the phone with an attitude. They are not considerate or sensitive of the ailments that they may come across through delivering for people. Terrible service. Poor communication.< /review>

<review>This is the type of Pharmacy that you get your prescription filled after someone has called it in such as Hospital or a Doctor's office only. They have high volume and the staff is very friendly and super busy. If you live in the neighborhood or your clinic is nearby this place is perfect. This is not a CVS or Walgreens. Shout out to Bella. She’s very professional and does a fantastic job among all the activity there. Unfortunately the floor manager seems like a very unpleasant person.<//review>< name>

It was very organized, this drug store. Their employees were very polite and courteous. They'll cater very well to your needs. Certainly, the pharmacist will suggest the best medicine for you. Amazing service!< /Review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>Atrocious customer service. After they failed to deliver my prescription and recorded in their system that they had, I ran on my spare pill stash for weeks. I refilled an old lower-dose prescription at CVS to make up the difference while I tried to get it corrected. It took me another week of failed delivery to get someone on the phone to tell me “you waited too long.” What? I eventually got them to refill the rest of the prescription minus the CVS dosage, which obviously they could have done in the first place. Rude. Unhelpful. We’ll see if it actually shows up.< /Review><Name>Craig Frantz</Name><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
I have been a quiet member of this Pharmacy, for so many years of 10+. I haven’t been able to meet any of them, only phone contact all these years ago. These are 1 negative and 2 positives, from the pharmacy taking advantage of my Medi-Medi and that is 1 of 2 positives. The number 2 is the delivery man “SERGIO”, that has been so cool and always professional and he clearly speaks and understands English, unlike most of you. When you all fail to deliver “1” medicine for my “treatment of my anxiety”, that’s a medicine I have been taking for years. I literally have to call them and all with the last one, I cannot even understand why.< /Review>

I like Allen's, it takes several. Insurances including medical. They deliver or mail your refills and they do check their voicemail when you leave your information with refills needed. Thank you< /text>

Only downfall, their phones can be busy, but I got through after a few tries.< /text><rate>5<//rate><Name>Daisy Withers<//Name>< Pictures>

If you enjoy receiving no help and being mocked by an incompetent and rude staff this is your place!  You get what you pay for, defective medication and bottom of the barrel service.  I'd rather stay sick than deal with them again.</Text>

They are faithful when they deliver, and when I want to go pick them up they are ready and it's a quick process it's nothing, the dosage measurement has always been right, and they are situated in a good location.< /text>

<Time>1539300352556</Time><Rate>1<//Rate><Review>I've given Allen's pharmacy 5 chances before I'm calling it.   I work a lot and the delivery service is ideal and the only reason I chose them.  5 times they have made mistakes between charging my card but not setting a delivery, setting delivery but not showing etc.  I called in today to find out where my prescription is from 10:37am ( which the manager made a point of saying trying to prove me wrong because i said 10:30) and that deliveries start at 11 and it's my fault I missed it . Fine, although the previous guy said they forgot it.    I was told that they can't do anything about it, they hire drivers and that it's not their problem.  I asked for his guarantee that my next order would be properly handled and he said he can't give me that guarantee.  Somehow it's my fault and my problem by the time were done talking.  I'm done.   Poor customer service and poor understanding of customer relations.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>I was condescended to and cut off mid sentence multiple times. After trying to calmly state why I didn't understand, the "Pharmacy manager" that was so awful this entire time said something I could not believe. In reference to my not understanding he said in a judgemental tone, "Is it because you are off your medication?" I them asked to speak to his supervisor or boss and he simply stated that he was it ("It's me..." ) and had no boss because "they're an independent pharmacy". I then asked for the owner's phone number and he repeated in a child like sing song tune "Nope! Nope! Nope, Nope!!" He claimes his name was Isaac W. My phone call took place around 9:15 am.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Time>1532709574500<//Time><name>Bee Rich<//name>< gmap_id>

<Review>Sometimes frustratingly slow, but always consistent. I am still peeved because of no "Imprime duo" on their answering machine, causing me to listen again in Spanish to what I just heard in English. This wouldn't be so bad except for the nature of the language, which takes about three times longer than to say its English equivalent.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

This time however it was a different story....I went in to get a glucose monitor that CVS wouldn't give me but the insurance said it was covered. I had my doctor resend it to Allen's. I was told that  they would give it to me because  CVS had already filled it (not true). The person helping me was so rude. When I told her my doctor sent them the prescription she said really loud "where is it"?  I reexplained that my doctor sent it to them. She said "Well we can't help you  CVS has already filled it".  She was very loud and not willing to help. I left very frustrated.< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80d954a7a933f33b:0xfc332b85f19f293a<//gmap_id></record>

Allens takes care of my disabled son’s medications, and I have yet to deal with any other pharmacy or health care clinic that can match the effort they put out to make sure their patients have their meds. And they treat their patient population with real respect, which makes a real difference. You can’t fake that and I can’t thank them enough for helping my son, whose disability leaves him unable to pay anything at all - you’d never know he was treated any differently as I watch him interact at the counter and on the phone. Allens deserves whatever reimbursement they receive for helping the challenged group with mental illness downtown. They serve with alacrity and skill, and with the emotional wisdom to know that looking somebody in the eye, saying their name, and doing so with genuine regard is a humanizing thing to do. And they do it well.<//Text>

<text>Had these guys for about 4-5 years I love the fact that the delivery people are willing to drive far distances to deliver the medicine my concerns are few is that the drivers show up unannounced as for the pharmacy if u get a new prescription notify them to get rid of the old one or they may continue to send the old one until the refills run out< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Allen Pharmacy has been my pharmacy for the past four years.  They have always been prompt with mailing my prescriptions.  At one point, my meds were mailed to me on a regular basis without me even having to call in for a refill request.  My meds always arrived within a day from my call placed to have the meds sent out.  They are very attentive and informative.  I highly recommend this pharmacy for anyone looking for a reliable-trustworthy pharmacy.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

The staff at Allen Pharmacy lie about receiving calls from clinics concerning medicine. Allen Pharmacy doesn't want you to get the medicine you need. Don't use Allen Pharmacy.</Review>

<review>Kinda bummed. So I went online to find the best priced service. I found metro had the $40 unlimited online PLUS a $100 gift card. However, when I tried to sign up online, it wouldn't let me choose a plan and only buy a SIM card.
So I called Metro and spoke to someone who said I could go to a store and get a everything set up. So I go to meet Alex, tell him the whole deal. I had printed out what plan I wanted as well as the portion about the $100 maser card. He said he would set everything up in store and when he was done, I could go online to redeem the $100 gift card.

Well, that isnt true. I tried signing up for the gift card online and couldn't do it, so again, I called Metro and the gal told me that I could not access it because I had to sign up online. So I was a bit miffed, because honestly, I really could have used the $100, but whatever.
Then today, I log into my account and the payment is $40 a month, which is what I wanted, BUT its not unlimited:( The unlimited is only for On-line activation. So two issues, frustrated, but its not going to kill me. Alex was friendly and helpful, but I highly suggest if you want the deals online, don't let anyone say you can do it another way. Its only ONLINE!<//review>< gmap_id>

I've been coming to the store for over a year and a half now and a Adel is the most knowledgeable patient and kind owner of the any store I've been to! I love coming here because if I have a problem with anything on my phone he figures it out right away compared to other places. I don't want to go anywhere else this is my store to go to. I would recommend the store to any friends family or coworkers.</review>

I went into this location for the first time in a couple months. Let’s just say the customer service has gone the drain. I went in to buy a phone (possibly two) and I wasn’t greated nicely by the girl there at all! Very rude! She didn’t really seem like she knew what she was doing. Kept giving me higher prices each time she rang up the phones. I used to come here when the younger tall guy was here (amazing customer service for sure!) but I left pretty unsatisfied. Definitely going to a different location from now on.<//Review>

I went in here a couple days ago to buy a phone, I was recommended by a friend who came here serval months ago but boy was I let down! I wasn’t happy with the service at the all! I was talked to rudely, workers seemed too interested on their phones than what the customer wanted!! Should’ve read what the other reviews said before coming here! Major let down. I’m taking my business somewhere else.</text>

I had called several Metro stores before I called this location. When I called & talked with Alex I was impressed that he took the time & interest to answer my questions. Because of his professional attitude I made a special trip to this location from Mission Viejo. When I arrived Alex was not there but Adel was. Adel was just as professional, courteous, patient, & informative as Alex. I was so happy I took the time to make the trip to this location. Many thanks to both Alex & Adel I was so happy that I got all my problems & questions solved in one trip. I will definitely be back. Thank you so very much for the great customer service.</text>

I was able to walk out of there with two new phones, the ones I actually wanted in the first place. He included a case, screen protector and earbuds built into the price. Would most definitely go to this location moving forward for all of my wireless needs. Customer service at it's finest 👌< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

My daughter was taken advantage of this store took 200.00 dollars for a phone two weeks ago and she still doesn't have the phone and they are refusing to give her money back so she can have the opportunity to take her business elsewhere
I'm not happy about this and will now file a complaint with   BBB

My complaint was quickly resolved
The owner Adel got my daughter her phone today
We just picked it up from Metro PCS RedHill Avenue
The owner was very concerned and personal
He was really nice
Thank you Adel😀👍</Text>

<Text>This is by far the best location for Metro PCS that I have ever been to. I came in here to make a payment and found out that I can add two lines to my account and I'll be paying $90 for 3 Lines unlimited everything so the guy here hook me up with two phones I know I'm only paying $90 for all three lines no other store has mentioned that to me or even try to offer me something that would benefit me like this</Text><name>Steve Nilson<//name>< Time>

Finally made the switch , I’ve been to several Metro PCS stores and I wasn’t really convinced until I came in this store . Adel And Zayra went above and beyond breaking everything down to the T. They were so helpful and professional, they weren’t so pushy like the other stores , they kept it simple and told me my options. The prices they gave me were so much better than the other stores I’ve been to, I even purchased the cases, tempered glass and memory cards for my new Samsung j7 star And I got a sweet deal . Wouldn’t go anywhere else . Thank you</review>

The new look inside the store is great! What I love is the "pay 6x" at A&M Metropcs and you will get free accessory! Adel, who assisted me is very knowledgable and has great customer service!< /Review>

<review>Been going to this store for a while now, finally leaving my boy Hector a review. Every time I make my payment he's sure to let me know what new promo's are out and always looking to save me money. Metro reps that actually care about their customers are hard to find, been referring family and friends here all the time. See you guys next month!</review>< Pictures>

<review>Bad customer service & the most surprising aspect of the situation was that I was dealing with the owner of the store who refused to give me a refund on the phone because I was 22 minutes over the 1 hour of talk time, he also refused to refund my accessory. He mentioned some irrelevant comment about being there for 14 years? HORRIBLE SERVICE< /review><resp>None< /resp>< rate>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Came into this Metro store just to get an idea of what their service offers. Zayra was kind enough to answer all of my questions. She showed genuine interest in how I use my phone and suggested the Samsung J2. The customer service was so amazing, I decided to go ahead and open up an account and she gave me an awesome deal on a wallet case and temper glass. Definitely not this well received at other Metro stores I've been to, thank you Zayra!<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>The worst service ever, no one would help me.  Even after one customer was just browsing phones, the employee refused to let me just pay my cell phone bill...because he was helping the gentleman that was looking at phone....mind you he was looking at phones! Not buying anything or asking question but literally looking at phones...I didn't know anyone had to be babysat while doing so and he was so occupied watching this man look at phones that he couldn't help me....plus they have a female employee who had to count out loud doing whatever it was that she was doing but she also couldn't be bothered to help me either ........super annoying</review><user_id>114789285999919161494<//user_id><Rating>1<//Rating>< pictures>

Came in to pay a bill, they asked to check my account to see if they can save me some money. I had 3 lines for $120, and they informed me I can get an additional line for FREE! Adel broke it down to me and all I paid was taxes and activation, the phone was free and now I have 4 lines for the same monthly amount I was paying before. So glad I came here :)<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>This one of the best Metro Locations I’ve been to. Went to make my phone monthly payment and the service is great! Every time I go, the staff let me know of their promotions going on unlike other metro pcs locations that I've been to. The store manager Enio, is very helpful at answering all my questions I have. He is very knowable of all the phones and deals they have at the moment, he always goes above and beyond. Great manager!

One day I went in to make changes to my plan. There was a good amount of people inside but the staff there were fast and only had to wait a few minutes. I was impressed on how fast they were able to get through all of us in a short period of time

Diego and Jazmine are also amazing staff. They are very patient with their customers over the phone and walk-ins. I wish all customer representatives everywhere were just like the staff here. Thank you Metro PCS for hiring awesome staff like them!!!!</review>< pictures>

THE WORST STORE IN TOWN!!!!

Trust me, just don't go there at all. A complete waste of time of yours. Staff doesn't follow the the people who are in the line. They only love hispanic customers, for them they do all sorts of things and spend 50 minutes each. You will always find a bunch of customer service reps but they all together help one customer-completely insane....

I switched because of this store to another network provider and will complain about this store to metro pcs directly.

I was happy with metropcs but this store has turned me into a lost customer.< /review>

The worst customer service, careless and most probably they are not well educated.

MetroPCS are not professional, and this store in specific is the worst.<//Review><time>1516940592373< /time>< Response>

Every time I come to Fresno this is a must do. With the improvements made to course, a challenge but those rewards. Priceless.
The staff is always great and add to the experience.<//review>

The associates are pleasant, helpful and provide a very comforting feeling when you play this course. It's a fun course to play. The course has improved greatly in the last year or so, the tees are still a little rough. It's a great place for a round of golf.<//review>

After many years of awful greens I am happy to report the greens have had a miraculous turnaround.  Not perfect but worlds better than last August when I last visited.  Well done.  This will get people out there.  Perhaps the new freeway coming in is no coincidence...keep it up!</Text>

Sherwood is on its way back!! The greens are looking better and the fairways are coming in!! The best I’ve seen the course in past 5 years. Will be going more often if they keep it up. Anyways the course plays tougher than majority of Fresno courses because of how many fairways play tight with so many trees! I always love playing the course and having the opportunity to think around the course: Don’t underestimate the toughness of this layout it will make you pay!< /text>

Facility is very good. Some of the staff are very nice. One of them are absolutely rude. Good luck on which one you get...

As an update, I played the course last fall and the staff was better. The food was great as always. The greens needed a lot of work though. As a whole, a good valley golf experience.</Text>

Vastly improved course quality in past few months, after several years of drought and maintenance issues. Hopefully they can maintain it at this level and return to their past glory. Best greens here in more than 2 years. Great staff and nice little clubhouse. Good range balls and practice area.</Review>

<rating>4<//rating><review>October 2018. Sherwood has improved much this late summer season. At this time the tee boxes are in good condition, they were being sanded while we played our round two weeks ago. The fairways were in good condition on most holes. Plenty of sand in the bunkers. Some of the greens have trouble spots and work is being done to repair. Overall the course is receiving more maintenance and improving.< /review>< pics>

Friendly staff, reasonably priced for the location, decent course, and beautiful scenery for the valley. The course almost feels like you're in the Forrest.</Text>

My experience here was awful point blank. First off, their prices on their website don't match what they are at the club house. their twilight special is 30$ and that includes a cart. for 29$ you can go to dragonfly which is a far better course and far better maintained. I was expecting a lot more because the course conditions were just horrible. Their greens had numerous dead spots throughout the course and reminded me of airways 2.0. Then towards the end round, I was approached by an old man named randy who apparently worked at the course. He yelled at me and called me and called me a "Dumb F**k". He was yelling at me because apparently you aren't allowed to drive the carts anywhere but the cart paths. Most courses post signs when it is a cart path only day. The way i was approached was very disrespectful. for the price i recommend you using your money else where. its definitely not worth it. If i could give negative stars I would.</text>

I have played Sherwood for almost twenty years. I love the course, but conditions are starting to deteriorate. Fairways are very long, and greens have lots of weeds in them. My biggest problem with Sherwood is how they treat junior golfers. My daughter plays for the local high school team. A few weeks ago she and a couple of her team mates were approached by Randy, the owner, and he asked them, "What are you doing here?" Not, "Hi, how are you ladies today?" "How are you playing?" No, he hassled them for being there. They are paying customers just like anyone else. Thank them for playing your course, don't hassle them. Finally, when I play with my ten year old son, they charge full price for both of us. About a month ago we played in front of my daughter and her team mates. Sherwood charged me $52 for myself and my ten year old to play nine holes with a cart. Absolutely ridiculous!! I'll be honest, if it wasn't so close to home, my family and I would play somewhere else. Stacey, if you read this, please, please, please, offer a reduced rate for juniors. Most courses have an NCGA "Youth on Course" rate of $5.</review>

<review>Its too sweet for my taste. Yes i know you can lower the sweetness but for the standard taste it feel like im drinking sugar. There is also a ton of sugar at the bottom of the cup. Now i have to wait for the ice to melt.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1K8D1ArxxG2NxzhsnqvSFoh1BaImiEC3mDPHY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQ79m5OdpZrhvt3S5LtxTqgL6D0_yTf6Ww0tf4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQTTVOuTshv24ilrTE5_6X8JVHymXy0guMJrM5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

<review>Great coffee place very close to the sunset cliffs. Easy to grab a coffee and go watch the ocean and sunset. The staff is super nice and patient. They were just a crew of 3 but were handling the pickup and huge drive through queue very efficiently. I love the “Life’s better buzzed” merchandise as well in this place!
This is a chain so if you’re in San Diego, do try!<//review><GmapID>0x80deaba46b8e0563:0x67806f0915c364b2</GmapID><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEPbCdY9kZWpfca0_5zLuJ7N0oRCI2RBdBPxmN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><date>1613363399939</date><user_name>Sayali M<//user_name>< Resp>

Brainless management! This place makes u wear a mask while going through a drive through while touching my coffee cup with their dirty hands. The point is if you are going to be super careful than be 100%. Don't fake to that you care because you don't. Not about customers or your own employees. To keep everyone safe you could have installed and rebuild that drive through window so people wouldn't have to touch with their dirty hands my food but you didn't you wanted to be cheap and you wanted to make people obey your coffee drive through window.</Review>

Only had one menu item & only been once. But the horchata latte (almond milk, horchata, espresso) was delicious if you like cinnamon, vanilla & sugar. And I do. Staff was courteous & helpful. Small but clean, bright place inside. I think there was some outdoor seating too.</Text>

<time>1620152236054< /time><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>The staff at this location are the finest on Earth. I live in the neighbrhood, and am sometimes here twice a day, as a little break from my work to chat with the folks here, and also to get the best coffee.

I know they use "Black Magic" brand espresso, but I think their coffee is literal magic, because it's tasty, boosts my energy, and keeps me coming back all the time!

Their avocado toast is divine, and after two years of being a regular, I am still exploring their menu.

You'll always receive excellent customer service here, from genuine folks who work hard to fuel the neighborhood, and neighborhorhood visitors.

Shout-out to the the crew on all shifts: thank you for always remembering my name, and making my day a little better with your warmth and humor.

Y'all deserve a raise! Someday I need to buy stock in Better Buzz, if it ever goes public!

Thanks again for being a shinining model of a well-loved Mom and Pop business. We appreciate you!

I hate this better buzz. The people that frequent this better buzz location always block my driveway and are inconsiderate when I’m trying to simply pull in and go home after work. -10/10 work on your drive through.< /Review>

F Starbucks’s, this is my new fave place lol 😍 I never liked açaí bowl before but they have the best I’ve ever tried. $9 a bowl for how much you get? Yesss. Other places charge $9.75 almost $10 for a small little 8oz bowl. I love this place, and their coffee? AMAZINGGGG. They always have wonderful customer service.<//review>

<Review>The attendants could be a tad more friendly when taking customer orders. But otherwise I love their Iced Best Drink ever and their Avocado toast plain, I tried adding bacon the other day but I hated it, it was very chewy almost like the bacon was made out of plastic.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
I love Better Buzz. They are better than Starbucks.  #ISaidWhatISaid
I'm giving PL 5 stars because the food and drinks are always on point.
However, customer service matters. I shouldn't have to hear a "yeah" or "yep" or "uh huh" when I ask a question. I know this is SoCal and things are a bit lax, but "yes" provides a level of customer service that seems to be disappearing for some reason.

This never happens at BB Miramar.</Review>

Loved this place! Went every morning of our vacation. The team working is super hardworking, efficient and fun. The music is on point. Coffee, both drip and latte, was delish. We got sandwiches and baked goods and all were good sized portions and tasty. Definitely recommend! Parking is tough - there's a drive thru or street parking but you might need to walk a block or two.<//text>

Did you want coconut?” or “Oh, you wanted decaf? This definitely isn’t. Did you want decaf?” Yes, because that’s not only what I ordered but also what I enunciated specifically. The lack of comprehension and level of incompetence here is laughable.

<text>I had their lavender tea and it was probably the best tea I have had in the US! The smell of the lavender was perfectly complementing a bold taste of the tea. I also love their cookies. I had a gingerbread one which was Devine as well. Everyone working here is so friendly and chill! Love the place. This outlet isn’t as big as some of the other, but they do have drive through!</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQACLG4K1NQktwLxjhuqshKqLiCISMUwJxoab2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

A lot of people highly recommended this place to us. The traffic for the drive thru was bad enough we had to skip it the first two days. Third day was the charm when we drove by just minutes after they opened. They made the orders quickly. The coffee was good but didn't live up to the hype. Don't plan on stopping here in the morning if you're in a rush.</Text>

I've been to several places and I absolutely loved their "Best Drink Ever". Didnt regret it and luckily I walked there but their parking is a challenge. That's literally the only complaint I have of this place, wonderful staff, excellent drink and quality and most importantly fine ambiance. I'm happy to return as soon as possible< /review>

I love Better Buzz!! They have the BEST acai bowls. They also have good quality coffee and teas unlike SB. I've been supporting this local business for a few years. Only gets Better with time 😁<//review>

I had a hot vanilla bean latte, loved it! I'm a coffee lover, so definitely recommend it. The coffee has a nice flavor and aftertaste and is not super sweet like you would find in most places. My friend had the 'Best drink ever' coffee which is Americano+vanilla cream and that was really good too if you need that coffee punch and less creaminess than a latte. Their regular coffee size is actually a medium and so is good enough quantity-wise. Rates are between 5-6$ for espresso drinks.</text>

Great drinks, but their covid measures are oppressive and not connected to science anymore. Unfortunately we won't be coming back to a place that makes their opinions mandatory in open air with over ten feet between customers. Just sad.<//Review>

I have an infatuation with better buzz. Literally everything is so good!!! Highly recommend their PSL for the season. Their blended drinks are too good (I finish them in less than 30 sec). Also, definitely recommend picking up one of their croissants!< /Text>

I love better buzz, but unfortunately my experience at this location today was not the usual experience.  The store I most often use is in PB where the coffee is superb and the customer service is unmatched. Today the coffee was great but the woman who “helped” me was not only rude but also very unhelpful. I appreciate people working under the current circumstances, but if you don’t want to be there then please go home.</review>

Asked if wanted avocado on sandwich ordered. Asked how much extra, they said $1.00. I said sure. Got receipt before sandwich. Noticed they charged $1.75 on receipt for that slice of avo. Asked them to confirm he quoted me $1.00 for it. He said he could take it off and refund the difference. I told him forget it but told him quotes are expected to be right. Of course no tip. Plus management will see this. Did not notice a price list for extras on their board there. It's the principal. You don't see an extra quoted so you get a firm quote that was admitted. Then it's different. Breakfast sandwich  $9.37 out the drivethru.< /text>

<Review>This coffee shop is really cute. The decor is beautiful, food and coffee is tasty and the service is friendly and quick.

In the sense of ordering your coffee and food, this place is pretty traditional. You order your items at the counter and grab a number and a table (if you're dining in). The only bummer is that you have to pick up your coffee but it's not that big of a deal, I just wish I was made aware to pick up the coffee - especially since they give you a number. The food was delivered to the table though.

I ordered the Honey Latte which was BOMB! The Vanilla Latte was good too.

We also tried the Avocado Toast with Feta- it came on a thick slice of bread. I loved it. I thought it was hearty and healthy.

I definitely plan on coming back here again. I hear the Matcha Latte is amazing too.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80deaba46b8e0563:0x67806f0915c364b2< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Anytime I can avoid a national chain brand, I’m willing to try a local coffee shop. Not only do they have wonderful breakfast choices, they have wonderful coffee.

I ordered B.B.A.B. almond butter, bacon and banana sandwich which was made on hearty bread. My husband ordered 3 Seed Avocado toast. Both were freshly made and delicious.

I generally drink straight black coffee but was tempted by the “Best coffee drink ever” made with Buzz’s vanilla sugar. It had a wonderful touch of sweetness, not sugary.

My husband had two different blends – both delicious. We took one of them home

If you enjoy artisanal coffee, Buzz is a great place to skip your daily Starbucks for.<//review>

Walked over here this morning from my friends apartment. Very cute coffee shop, got a delicious nitro cold brew with a splash of oat milk x 2. The order came up very quickly & the cashier was very sweet.

They are closed for dinning and entering the space due to COVID-19. Cute covid decor, the cashier offered me a free avocado toast & it was delicious.

They also have a drive thru which is pretty rad!< /Text>

This shop is super cute but has a really terrible parking situation.

Like I think I've been here a dozen times and have never found parking anywhere nearby.

There is a drive-through though so that's what makes it 4 stars.  If you can find parking and get inside it's super cute and cozy and the staff are always very very friendly.

Love the coffee, everything is good.  But the blended mocha mint is a must and I love the Black Lavender Tea with vanilla powder.

YUMMMM.< /review>

They are nice, but NEVER get the order right. It's almost comical, if it weren't so frustrating. Last time we drive away work someone else's drinks, just to figure it out a few blocks away.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80deaba46b8e0563:0x67806f0915c364b2</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

First time here; went through the drive thru, drive thru was small/short, so some people were backed up on the street. It was around 1230-1 when we went, the wait didn't take long, maybe a whole 3 mins. The people that took orders were nice, they were standing outside, kinda like how In and Out Burger/Chick-fil-A do it. I ordered the dragon smoothie, I was pleasantly surprised with the taste, very fresh, sweetened only with whatever was in the smothie, cold, and light and fruity tasting. They give paper straws here, so that was cool. Next time I come here I will try the lavender tea latte, iced, its probably really good. My bf had the hot coffee, best drink ever; I tried it and it was very good, I'm not a big coffee drinker either, but there was sugar and cream/milk in this one but it was light and you could taste the coffee, it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. I saw some bad reviews of this place but honestly, my first time here and it was perfect service and our order was right, so maybe it was just a bad day for the other customers who complained about the customer service. I would highly recommend this place, there are a lot of options to choose from.<//text>

Awful place. Wish I could give zero stars and get my money back. Nitro cold brew isn't nitro; it's just cold brew, and bad cold brew at that. Smoothie was too thick and needed a spoon. Never again.<//text>

This place s always busy for a reason. It is great! I come for the avocado toast and a killer bee, their version of a red eye. But if you want to treat yourself get the self-titled "best drink ever" they aren't lying.</Text>

<Text>This location is a bit tricky. It is better for you to drive through the neighborhood to be sure you can access the drive-through. "No Left Turns" ⬅️ (When you go, you'll see what I mean.)
So, when you go be ready to be patient (or go inside) but the staff is friendly and the coffee is delicious!
Breakfast is also awesome!<//Text>< Rating>

Great use of lids that do not require straws, and they have metal straws available if a straw is desired. They separate trash and recycling which is great to see as well. I got a mocha (my signature specialty drink), but it kind of just tasted like chocolate milk. It was not bad, but I would have liked it much more if it has a stronger espresso taste. The food is good as well, I got a Ham Brioche Breakfast sandwich and I recommend it.< /Text>

<Review>Staff is not knowledgeable -at all- about coffee or their products, but they have fun personalities. Put your coffee snootiness behind yourself, and just order what sounds good. My fav.? The Honey Latte.<//Review>< time>

<Text>One of the better coffee places in San Diego as far as coffee goes. This location is small and sometimes difficult to get in to park. The parking lot can be accessed just south of the building on Roscrans, otherwise you have to wait for the drive thu to get in. The drive thru is full most of the time but they move people along pretty quick.
The coffee is great. Not sure where they get the baked good from for all their locations but the quality is good.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Better buzz coffee was great, I attended the place with some of my extended family of 10 and they were super accommodating! They had seats for us and a wonderful staff. You could tell the place was popular because of the drive thru line that went through the street! I ordered a white mocha and it was exquisite. I'm definitely going to come back soon<//Review>< pictures>

Decent place to grab a coffee and some breakfast.  There is usually a line and the staff does their best to get people through.  As this business expands to more locations the quick friendly service people come to expect takes a dip into the negative.  Best cup of coffee and OG açaí bowl don’t disappoint though.< /text>

Cute place, decent coffee. Too bad the parking and the service is terrible. Literally 5 people stood around and looked everywhere except the front register where myself and another customer were waiting. The girl who "waited" on me kept walking away before I could even ask for a receipt (turns out she left the iPad in mid-transaction, making me think she was looking to add on her own tip after I left,) and then left / ignored the register again before I could ask for the code to the bathroom (with the other customer still waiting behind me.) Another girl finally helped me out -  kudos to her - but the whole experience does not make me eager to return, at least to the Rosecrans location.<//text>

I’ve come here a few times and the service is always horrible. They mess up your order almost every time. How hard is it to make a drip medium roast coffee? I love better buzz. The this location needs a revamp on the customer service.</review>

< Review>
I've been a regular for the past 3 years as it's close to my house. The coffee is usually great and the employees are always friendly, but the service has become increasingly slower in the last 6 months.
I just went over for a coffee at 630a. The lobby was empty, there were only two cars in the drive-thru, and I counted 7 employees. If there was a manager there, they weren't taking charge of anything. It took 15 minutes to get my coffee! When I went back to the register and asked where my coffee was, everyone was confused and then scattered. No one apologized or said they'd make it. There was silence and had to wait another 5min. How do you forget an order when it's the only one?!
You lost a regular today. Get your act together.< /Review>

I absolutely loved this place but they are falling fast. Lately, they have been slacking on everything, slow service, drinks aren't blended or are watered down. Today was the last straw, I paid $8 for a acai bowl which are typically wonderful. Today was the first time I felt ripped off!!! The bowl is about a 1/3 of it's normal size. I brought it up to the girl at the window and she just laughed. I will no longer be going to Better Buzz, I tried and tried with you guys. Oh yeah Better Buzz in Pacific Beach might be the worst of all. Sorry but not sorry. Thanks</text>

Well, I met someone there to discuss a business opportunity. While I was waiting for her another very interesting couple from Long Beach bought me a cup of coffee. My first trip there was a lot of fun and there's definitely a better buzz. There was a line of cars all the way around the corner waiting to get in the Drive-Thru . I recommend walking on a Saturday morning. The coffee was fantastic and so were the puppies. Thank you better buzz. I will be back.<//text>

Great place to study if you can get a table. The benefit is that many people go through the drive through so there is less in store traffic.</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>It’s a hit and miss. I order the same just about every time; islander bowl with honey and almond butter, O.G. bowl no honey, no blueberries banana instead. I always drive-thru, pretty much successful. Fun, indoor/outdoor seating, bright with natural sunlight, music... it’s pretty clean. Every now and then my order gets mixed up. Does it irritate me? Yes. Will I be back? Yes. Do I recommend? Yes.<//text>< Pics>

Best drink ever lives up to the name. Staff is always great! Always whipping up great seasonal drinks to change it up. If it has maple or salted caramel, I am all over it!</text>

<text>This was my first ever Better Buzz location. Delicious drinks. I enjoy the açaí bowls and avocado toast often. 😊❤️

Small interior and sometimes difficult to find parking but great vibe, cute patio area if it’s unoccupied. They sell shirts and other memorabilia with super cute sayings ex: “Life Is Better Buzzed.”<//text><GmapID>0x80deaba46b8e0563:0x67806f0915c364b2</GmapID>< Name>

When it first open it was great! However past couple times I've gone the Best Drink Ever always tastes different and today was awful! Mind you I usually go every morning before work at 5 am and after today I think I will  be going elsewhere.<//Text>

This place was a great discovery in Point Loma! As a coffee addict, I was impressed by their coffee and they have a lot of variety. I was also very happy to discover that they have a drive thru so I can swing in on my way to work. Also, their customer service was top notch! Always had a smile and the place has a great vibe. When I get a chance, I will actually go inside and spend some time there. So far, I have loved all the coffee I have ordered there.<//text>

<text>My wife loves the coffee here. She swears by the snickerdoodle latte. The place is small, always crowded, and they aren't very fast. Parking is a joke, and the drive thru line goes a bit down the street.

Coffee: awesome. Breakfast sandwich: awesome. everyone that know this place thinks it's awesome too, so get ready for that drive-thru line to go out to the street. Close-quarters parking lot and drive-thru line. It's worth it tho.< /Review>

Very shocked at how low quality the food was at this place. On my 1st and last visit my boyfriend and I ordered 2 different things to eat off the menu and 2 drinks. The total $$ was surprisingly the same as a night out to dinner for the two of us. However, before we actually tasted the food we assumed the prices were high because of the fresh/quality ingredients. In other words, "worth the money spent." Sadly, we were wrong and were extremely disappointed. It reminded me of cheap Dunkin' Donuts food but of course with a carefully chosen disguise. Nothing but pure deceit in this establishment.< /review>

It was not good. Long wait to order, despite there being no one in line. Then there were no tables inside available,  so we went outside. There was an umbrella which kept blowing so the sun shone on us. Then we had to wait 15 minutes to get our order. As I left,  there was a sharp metal edge on the corner of the table which tore my new dress. I will not be returning</Review>

Cashier/Server/barista  yelled at me when I partially opened a door (it was NOT locked) to ask a question from 35-40’ away. I did NOT walk in! I realize times are difficult. A second employee met me at a side entrance, behind a plexiglass barrier and answered my questions about ordering. I thanked her. Took my business elsewhere. Will NOT RETURN. 👎🏽</Text>< Date>

Every time I go to San Diego, I make sure to get my Better Buzz fix. I love the coffee here and at all there other locations. One downside is that it’s usually packed and the wait it super long.< /review>

I had a choice between Best Buzz Coffee  and Starbucks  since it's down the street. I decided to go to a true local coffeehouse. I ordered the island acai bowl. YUMMY!  My husband ordered the oatmeal. He was impressed that it was still hot. BBC is cute and quaint. The customer service is fantastic. The line was long; however, it went quickly.< /Text>

Nice coffee shop with a convenient location. Their coffees are strong and great on a hot day. The shop is small but you can sit down, beware of long lines at the drive through all summer.< /review>

If you take a picture of your items in the coffee house, it looks as if you set up a professional photo shoot. The tables, napkins, walls, coffee cups, and the floor among other things, have an extreme amount of detail and substance to them. Its really unlike any other place. You will not be disappointed.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Good coffee... service can vary wildly.  Unfortunately, we had one really bad morning, when our food was never made, and when we asked, they looked at us like we were crazy people.  They brought it out a little over 5 minutes after that. I understand mistakes, but they just didn't seem to care all that much, or they didn't express that care very well.<//Review>

<Review>Luckily the name is not 'better taste' because they would be sued for false advertising.
Cappuccino was made too hot, I went directly to westbean after this to get a decent coffee.
Nice try better buzz, better luck next time... Oh wait... There won't be a next time.< /Review><Time>1521067313297<//Time><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

He was kind, polite, and went out of his way to make sure that my order was to my satisfaction.

I'm not actually a coffee drinker, so I'm not the best person to review this. But when I do come here with my girlfriend, who is a coffee snob, I find the staff to be really great. They are always in a good mood and always seem to care about your drink. The breakfast sandwiches are really good and my girlfriend finds their avacado toast to die for. I always enjoy a red bull peach smoothie as an alternative pick me up.</Text>

I adore this little coffee shop. Nothing like a quality cup of coffee. We did the drive thru and the girl at the register was very friendly. Will be back again.</text>

Stopped by after a long week after gettng used to short weeks during the holidays. Ordered the bacon sandwich without the bacon, but rather than just stopping there the guy blew my mind by offering me some avocado and tomato on there. So I was like yes that's awesome, load it up and I'll get a cappuccino too. My sandwich was filled with fresh avocado and delicious tomato and the cappuccino was great. The guy working there was extremely nice. The menu is awesome and they use cage free eggs and compostable containers. Everything I want from a coffee shop.</review>

The lines may be long at times, but the coffee and the service are certainly worth it. I haven't had a single thing I haven't loved. I highly recommend the best drink better, iced.</review>

The bacon breakfast sandwich is one of my favorites. Good coffee drinks. The drive-thru is slow and backs up onto the street when it's busy, which is pretty annoying. Overall it's got good coffee and breakfast, and the service has vastly improved over the past year<//Review>

<review>Fast, and on point. I'm comparing Better Buzz with Better Buzz here. Faster than the one in MB and although it doesn't have as much seating, I like how much more BB merch they have. Last time I was there I was recommended to add  Peanut butter or almond butter to my acai bowl (with coconut) and it was a game changer!<//review>< time>

It cant be slightly difficult to access with limited parking and a small drive through. I have gotten their coffee 3 times now, and to be honest I was disappointed. Ill definitely try them again and get a different drink, but it may be my last if its like the last.</Text>

Passing by at 6:45 AM. Clients seem to be male, older or on their way to work. Noisy to order, but pleasant staff, though busy with drive through (only one parking space and that's for disabled), so you wait, and wait. There is only one person to make what you want. Beware, they put your cup inside another so its not too hot to hold, rather than give you a slip on, only trouble is that its difficult to get the plastic top off if you want to add cream or non fat milk, sugar etc.. A small is a medium in most places, and much the same price. In my opinion the coffee is nothing special to taste.<//Text>

Giving it 3 stars because of the service and the food. The drinks are either watered down or too sweet. If you have to go there I recommend the iced best drink ever and if you like Starbucks, you'll probably like this too. But it's not fine craft coffee.</Review>

I went to Better Buzz Coffee before I left San Diego to head back to Phoenix and I really wish I went there sooner. I visited numerous coffee shops in throughout San Diego and this place was by far the best coffee I had in the city. Customer service was impeccable and the espresso was delicious. Better Buzz Coffee is definitely my new favorite coffee shop in San Diego.<//text>

The coffee is just coffee.  Nothing special to it.  Specialty drinks are the same. The staff is awesome though and very friendly, always smiles on their faces.< /Review>

The quality of the items I ordered was okay, but the service needs improvement. There were many employees working behind the counter and not many customers inside waiting, but the wait was very long. Their main focus is getting the orders out quickly for the drive thru and the customers inside are secondary. If they fix this, I would come back.<//text>

Staff was incredibly rude. So much so that I can't even tell you about the quality of the food or drinks because I walked out so that the server would not sprain his neck from holding his head at such an awkward angle in order to look down his nose at me. (I'm about a foot and a half taller than the server was).
Apparently they have such a problem with homeless people abusing the complementary creamer and sugar that paying customers are routinely asked to leave upon using the creamer and sugar, much to their embarrassment.
Nice way to start off the day right?  Buying a cup of coffee and then being asked to leave after being mistaken for homeless.  Not coming back here ever.< /text>

< Review>
Not at all impressed.  I don't know if I just had a one-off of not so great coffee but beyond that, the atmosphere is not that great, pricing is about 50% too high for the quality and the staff seems rather aloof.  So first off...the coffee.  I got the Bold blend and it tasted so watered down I wondered if it was Burger King or McDonalds coffee.  I sipped on it for a bit and then finally having to accept the fact that it was just terrible coffee, I chucked it into the garbage on my way into Target about 15 minutes later.  $3.50 in the trash can.  Oh well.  Live and learn. Literally, take the most average coffee you've ever had and cut it in half with water...that's what it tasted like.  Price....$3.50 for what was about a 16oz coffee?  This is why Panera exists.  You want good coffee?  Either go down the street to a place called Jennings House Cafe (no, I don't work there...their coffee is legit), Panera or Dunkin Donuts if you must.  This Better Buzz place is just completely overpriced.
Atmosphere...obnoxiously loud.  Staff banging on cookware and just generally not very welcoming and friendly.  Forget about trying to have a meeting of any kind there.  You'll be yelling across the table at your acquaintance due to the loud music, staff banging the cookware and just the overall loud ambiance of the place.  I guess I gave it two stars for whatever reason. Probably deserves one....if even.  Owners must be making an absolute killing at those prices.< /Review>

Ok so the food and coffe are very good. THE WAIT HOWEVER!! They are so over run and they have a small drive through that backs up 20+ minutes into the small street. If you want to get coffee and you're on a schedule stay away but if you have the time it might be worth it</Review>

I'm going to give this coffee shop five stars because it's the best coffee I've ever had in Southern California. Not that it applies, but Four Barrel is my favorite in the city of San Francisco.</review>

Great coffee quality, fantastic customer service. Only downside is parking if you want to drink your coffee and not go through the drive-thru. But street parking isn't that difficult if you're willing to walk a hundred feet or so.</Text>

Great sandwiches and coffee. They have come a long way since they first opened as far as the drive thru. It's a lot faster but cars still spill out in to the street< /review>

<review>REALLY good tasting smooth coffee, not-so-sugary blended drinks. The Mocha Buzz is probably the creamiest drink I've ever had...kinda like a Frappuccino, but 100% better. No artificial chemical taste, actually tastes like coffee. Depends on who makes it though - other times it's tasted like nothing more than a shake. Also enjoyed the latte. For the around the same prices as their competitor, the drink sizes are pretty big I think: 16oz and 20oz. Another thing I noticed is that the drive thru speaker is the absolute clearest I've ever heard; it's like you're talking to the barista in person.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<Text>Like a lot of places that have drive up windows they ignore their in-store customers.  They have a gaggle of employees standing around doing nothing, while I wait 10 minutes for my coffee after I ordered.  Worst of all espresso just ordinary.  Nope, won't be a regular.< /Text>< Date>

Good coffee, great chocolate scone and a wonderful barista - he was so upbeat and friendly that we didn't mind waiting a bit longer to be served. Limited seating though, given the sea of students parked throughout the shop with laptops.< /review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Nice cup of coffee, but I think $ 3.75 for an espresso is ridiculous.

Lekker bakkie, maar $3.75 voor een espresso vind ik belachelijk.<//text>< GmapID>

<resp>None</resp><Review>(Translated by Google) A very popular place in the area of ​​scrap point. There is an opportunity to buy coffee, tea, snacks. There is a car service line where you can make and receive your order without leaving your car. The parking is very small and not yet convenient, because in order to get to it you need to stand in line.

(Original)
Очень популярное место в районе поинт лома. Есть возможность купить кофе, чай, перекусы. Есть линия обслуживания автомобилей где вы можете не выходя из машину сделать и получить свой заказ. Парковка очень маленькая и еще не удобная так как что бы на нее попасть вам нужно отстоять очередь.<//Review>< date>
