Good as a starter gym, or if your new to working out. Not for someone looking to find the best equipment out there. They have Smith machines, not really ideal for ppl who want to max out dead lifts squats and various bench press. overall I give it a 7 out of 10 gym. Staff is friendly.< /Text>

<review>Well laid out Planet Fitness location. Everything you expect from this chain of gyms. Equipment in very good shape and plenty of it. Plenty of free weights, Smith machines and benches. Friendly, upbeat staff. Beverages available for purchase.

Plenty of free parking. It is a large lot. Grocery store, restaurants and a variety of other stores in this shopping complex.

Nice area.</review><gmap_id>0x80dc713f98d88361:0x23b6f1ab4ca50021< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Pretty good for basic workouts and cardio. Machines are in good condition and there are standard plates and dumbbells available. Not the best place if you're into lifting heavy but great for lighter days. 24 hour access and great price, around $10 a month.<//text>

Love it here. It's clean, there's a ton of machines and weights to work with. People are good about wiping things down when they're done working out. And for $10 a month with no contract, there is no better deal.< /Review>

Have been trying to call to see why our membership was not cancelled as we thought it had been, and phone either rings for minutes or drops connection. Very unhappy with this as we have now been charged for months after thinking we had cancelled. Even reached out to our old club in another state to ensure that’s not where charges are originating.</text>

I'd give a zero if I could.A year later of when I was told that my membership should of been canceled because I don't live in CA anymore,they for some odd reason re did my membership for another year without my authorization at all.I tried going to a planet fitness in NM to cancel my membership and they couldn't do it because it's not the same ownership.I probably won't be reimbursed for their unauthorized agreement/payment.Very poor business in my opinion.<//review>

<Review>It's decent. Lots of room, plenty of cardio machines. A good amount of resistance/strength training equipment too. My only gripe is that there is no dedicated bench or squat rack. Sure you can use the smith machines, but do you really want to?
I also noticed that not very many people are wearing masks, so there's that too<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Planet Fitness is very chill. There's a wide variety of people there, from super fit to just beginning. Everyone pretty much keeps to themselves, like it should be. It's very clean and never too busy. Best of all, it's a fraction of the cost of other gyms. I'm very happy so far.<//review>

<review>This place is no gimmicks and only has the necessities. There's tons of cardio equipment, though. It's very reasonably priced and always very clean. I've only been a member for a couple of weeks, but I already like it better than 24 hour fitness and LA Fitness.<//review>< Pictures>

Husband and I have been going for 2 months. Large clean facility. Greeters are happy. Need more air circulation, little stuffy air quality at times. Love free bagels. New equipment, great lockers showers. The trainer was good but didn't show up for 2nd appt.< /Review>

My wife and I are new members.  We recently encountered a serious issue and the manager Chris went above and beyond my expectations to make it right! Chris had an EPIC level of customer service and seemed to genuinely care about the situation. He offered a very fair resolution and because of how well this was handled, we will always be loyal members and I will recommend this place to anyone looking for an awesome gym.
Thank you again CHRIS< /review>

Everything about this place is good except for the water fountains. This particular location should invest in an Elkay water cooler and bottle filling station which is standard at most gyms these days. Until then I will give it this rating.</text>

<Review>I have the black card membership and I have been going to all the other Planet Fitness gyms and this gym has become one of the best ones in my opinion. It has the standing tanning rooms and laying down tanning rooms, all the equipment is pretty basic but atleast all of the equipment can be used to get a basic workout. It also has a locker room and showers. The one thing negative thing about Planet Fitness is the new Company policy which means you cannot have your gym bag in the gym; it must stay in your car or at the locker room. That sucks honestly!< /Review><date>1567462948088<//date><Rating>5<//Rating>< userid>

<Text>For the price this is a very nice gym. Staff keeps it very clean at least whenever I am there. The parking lot is another story since it looks at times like the homeless have taken it over. I have not been down there at night but I would be more alert concerning the types that are living in their cars in that lot. That is not Planet Fitness's problem, that is the city's problem for not enforcing their laws concerning urban camping by bums.< /Text><resp>None<//resp><Name>Bryce McKenna<//Name>< rate>

Gym is super clean for being 6 years old. Staff does a great job of keeping it clean and are very welcoming. Its busy in the afternoons Monday through Friday but other than that it has a mellow level of traffic for the size of the gym. Love the pizza night too! They get Big Bobs Best Pizza and you cant pass that up! Overall a great place! Have been going for years and will continue to go.< /Text>

for the price this place is awesome.   If you are way into working out this may not be the place for you.  I work out 3x per wek usually and for the price you can't beat this place.  They also have good customer service and are not constantly trying to sell you training packages and upgrades< /Text>

Really like this place.  It's good if you are just wanting to do your own thing for your workout.  Plenty of machines, equipment/gym area cleaned regularly.  If you want personal training or lots of exercise class options, probably looking for a different type of gym<//review>

Staff is always nice and friendly and the club is always clean. Tha being said my issues are with the equipment. They do not have a good variety of machines to get a full workout in. Although i appreciate the new equipment, the new equipment to me was not built very well. The action on some of the new machines is terrible and doesnt feel smooth and full range. The new squat racks are the worst ive ever used. Not smooth and some seem to have unnecessary resistance. For that i am looking to join a new gym.<//text>

Love this gym for convenience (the Sprinter station is across the street, Albeetsons next door), and it's clean and spacious, but it's pretty bare-bones when it comes to classes and amenities. However, the fees are low and that appeals to me also.</Text>

I signed up, but when I went sine lazy chick named Amber was there I dont know why they have an anti people person working the front desk. Amber put me aside to help other people enroll when I was already to enroll myself. She wouldn't give me a tour of the place like Crystal told me they would when I spoke to her in the phone. Overall horrible sign up experience.<//review>

They have free weights and free WiFi as well.

If you pay for the $20 membership, you get unlimited tanning, hydro beds and massage chairs. Plus you can use your membership at other Planet Fitness places.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

This is the dirtiest location I have yet to visit .toilet sensors do not work and u must wait a long time to wash your hands because those sensors don’t work either . The showers do not access hot water nor do they put out enough water pressure so u will take a long shower because it trickles out ! the excuse for the last six months is the plumber does not have the parts ordered yet! This is the same excuse used three months ago when I visited . Again today when other woman mentioned the problem the employee uttered the same excuse .I told her that was the same thing they said months ago . I was then told by the employee “if you don’t like it I can terminate your membership “ I have contacted the main office and put in a request for the manager /owner of this location to get back to me . It’s a health department issue when the plumbing of a business fails for several months putting people safety and health at risk and the only thing the people behind the register had to say is that the manager will not come in until after 10 am there is nothing anyone can nor will do except take people’s money and have them join a broken in unkept gym  . The overall rude inconsiderate service those people provide is embarrassing  but hey the manager does not care either he’s to busy sleeping 😴</text>

< review>
I had a membership here didn't use it, had to pay for a buyout, did everything I was supposed to and they STILL charged my bank account AFTER the cancellation. So, I called back they set up a refund request and TODAY I am still trying to get my money returned. Now I have to wait for a manager to call me back. Nothing but a HASSLE I do not recommend them. They take your money on time and when they are not supposed to but when you are entitled to a refund they want you to go away or just not realize they are still charging your account! I'm getting ready to call their corporate office.</review>

<Review>It seems theres always police at night i got light shine one me  twice  walking out of gym but what can i say that opd for you..<//Review></record></dataset><record>
<text>I would consider this a good gym, but nothing fantastic. I'm not a fan of gyms or working out in front of other people in general, but this place gets the job done, and you can't beat the $10 per month fee. They have a lot of cardio equipment, which is most of the reason why I go there. I generally only go during the low time of the day, between 1:00pm to 3:00pm to avoid the crowds. I've been at night, and you basically spend more time bumping elbows with strangers and waiting for equipment to open up than actually working out. I get very irritated by the number of people who aren't serious about working out. There's always people babysitting the machines; just sitting there on their phones and not lifting a single muscle, or people who think the gym is a social place. I really wish the staff would be more attentive to that and say something to the lazy people. I suppose that's just the sort of people these less expensive gyms attract. I'm also a little disappointed that there aren't any real classes. You can sign up for small group lessons where you focus on a certain body part, but I already know how to do that, or I could watch a YouTube video for ideas. If I could afford a gym that teaches yoga, self-defense, or a sport, I'd go there instead. Still, if you're just looking for an inexpensive place to lift weights and do some cardio, then Planet Fitness is your place.<//text>< Date>

I worked out almost every day at planet fitness, it's a very clean facility, employees are always helpful and the benefits to a membership are amazing! I have been to other fitness centers where it's dusty, dirty and workout equipment is always breaking down but that didn't happen at planet fitness. The only disappointment I have with them is....
I've moved to Hawaii and they are not out here... Okay you've got to get your act together and move your facility to Hawaii, I would jump at the chance to be a member again (please please please)

<Text>This location is a dump. STAY AWAY!!! WORST LOCATION EVER! The management sucks! Poor maintenance on equipment. I reported broken pieces of equipment 8 months ago and they are still not repaired. There is never any toilet paper in the toilet stalls. Most often there is urine all over the floor and toilet seats. Showers are moldy broken/missing soap holders. The locker rooms get nasty at times. There is never any staff to clean the mens locker room. They hired a female mostly staff and they don't want to go into the mens locker room to clean. This is NOT a problem at other locations where female staff announce they are cleaning and go in.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1527019000299, 'text': "We can help forward your concern to the appropriate parties if you'd like to send us a  message at social@planetfitness.com with details.

<rate>1</rate><review>I had chosen Planet Fitness over other gyms because a friend works out there. I went in thinking I could check it out, maybe work out for a day to get a feel for the gym. Wrong, they wanted $20 for me to try out their gym, the cost of a day pass. I understood that the $20 would go towards my membership fees if I had chosen to join. For $9 more, a total of $29 I could just join and call it a day. So I did, worst thing I could have done! The front desk staff was rude, took my payment information but didn't even finish my application process. I had to come back and finish it, yet they had already charged my account and by this time I had YET TO WORK OUT! I was bothered by the rude staff and their horrible customer service. But I thought, for $10 a month maybe it won't be so bad after all and decided to go ahead and give it a try. Let me also add that they just gave me a "welcome bag" and as far as I know that was their only introduction to their gym I never got a tour, absolutely nothing. Needless to say I was ready to give up on their gym right after I had just joined. 3 out of 5 of their step masters were always out of service, the facility is dirty considering they expect everyone to clean up after themselves, just over all a horrible experience. I was ready to cancel less than a month after I had joined. I tried calling in to let them know and as you can see on their website, you have to go in and cancel. Okay, so I was finally able to go during one of my lunch breaks. Since their night staff was so horrible I figured I could go during the day and speak to a manager. I told him about how horrible I thought their gym was. He informed me I couldn't get my $29.99 "sign up fee" back and that I was three days too late to cancel for the following month. He did nothing for me except leave me with an even bitter taste in my mouth. Go else where. This place is sooooooo not worth it!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dc713f98d88361:0x23b6f1ab4ca50021<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I was invited by a friend to try the place out. My biggest problems are 1)No water pressure or hot water to take a shower after you work out. 2)The locker room/showers were dirty. 3) The staff was rude to me when I was simply asking basic questions about membership. Not joining this gym.I'll stay with mine.< /text></record>

Re: Policy

Dear Sir or Madam, regarding the "no gymidation" policy, consumers are given the declared respect; [p]er the discretion of the Articles of Incorporation, which sets a decent foundation for gym peers to indulge and feel welcomed mutually. The cost is decent, although locations and routine are dependant on your schedule, needless to say. Nevertheless, worthwhile.

I've gone to fitness 19 in Oceanside and each month they had maintenance people come in take the machines apart and refurbish them to new condition.

< review>
Been paying them for 2 seperate accounts for two years and never step foot into the gym. Canceled my accounts  which they said and theyre should not have been any buy outs. But low and behold another $39 for each account withdrawn from my checking. I get so tired of disputing everything with all these scam artists in the world.why should I have to go through this. Tired of the bullshit.< /review>

<text>I have been going to planet fitness for 1 month now, i love it,  almost all of the staff is great fun outgoing happy and fun to talk to, except for 3 of them.My friend and i usually go there like at 7 to 8pm maybe 8:30pm and there 2 to 3 times a week we see 3 staff members, they do not talk to anyone, smile. or seem to want to interact with clients, my friend has a loud voice her and me were having a conversation and one of the staff (lady with longgg black curly hair),went up us and said can u pls be quiet, u r disturbing people, we were shocked , since we had been going there for 2 weeks and she was the first staff member out of MANYYY  to ever say anything to us, we looked around and only saw 6 people working out half of them on their ipods,, O.o, so we let this pass and became quiet ,now weeks after, today december 22 2012, my friend was watching football on tv and shes all into the game and being loud saying COME on yay wow good job, and the (long hair lady) sent one of the other staff to tell her to be quiet,that was the tip of the ice berg, since there were only 3 people at the gym and no one was paying attention to her since they were all making funny facces because they were sore from working out, so then me and my friend said ,well you (lady in black hair) are the only staff member who tells us to be quiet, no other staff members in other days ever tells us or any other loud person anything, they all know us and talk to us and are friendly and like us, you and your other 2 friends are the only ones who tells us to b quiet,we tell her  no one is here, she says i know no one is here, thats why i come work at this time, its empty, that basically let me and my friend know this (lady in long black hair) does not like people and does no like loud noises,and it kinda explains it when you look at how she doesnt like to be friendly with members. Basically , she ruined our workout,does not like us, and because of her and her other 2 friends, we are not and do not recommend , going to planet fitness late at night, i would hate for other people to go through this, we are not mean people we do not want trouble, this lady just doesnt like loud sounds, and is the only  one who complaints about it.
PLANET FITNESS IS A NO JUDMENT ZONE AND THIS LADY JUDGES MY FRIEND ON HER VOICE, o.O ,THERES OTHER STINKY,SWEATY PEOPLE, WHO SH DOESNT TELL ANYTHING TO o.O

THE MANAGER HAS BEEN THERE AND WE HAVE BEEN THE SAME AN  HAVE ACTED THE SAME WAY WE ACTED TODAY, SHE LIKES US, WE TALK TO HER, AND SHE NEVER TOLD US ANYTHING, WHAT SHE DID DO, WAS PUT THE STAFF WHO DOES NOT DOO ANYTHING ALL DAY, TO CLEAN THE MACHINES AND WAS TELLING OTHERS WHAT THEY (SHOULD) BE DOING.

FOR GODS SACK EVEN THE JANITOR, LIKES TALKING TO US ,AND GOES UP TO US WHENEVER WE TAKE A BREAK AND ASKS US ,HOW WE ARE DOING, WHATS GOING ON, HOW IS YOUR WORKOUT GOING.< /text>< pictures>

<text>Stopped in here on our way to Tony's. Great simple place with many vegetarian options. The chilaquiles had a great kick to it and the burrito was enormous with a great combination of flavors. The service was quick and professional. No prices were posted and some of the dishes can be pricey, though our food was under 15$. Can't wait for our next trip to try the Birria de chivo.< /text>< pics>

The food delicious, 100%... The menudo is a MUST have... They just need to expand as soon as possible because it is ALWAYS packed (for good reason, the food)...< /text>

A small place with really good, authentic Mexican food.

4 people in our party and got our food out very fast.

Had the chicken enchiladas, their sauce is a little spicy, not too much and so good!

Two got the chile verde with homemade tortillas, said they were great

One got tacos, 4 different kinds. They liked all except the goat birria, just for personal preference though.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) This Sunday we went to try the birria because we had very good recommendations and we had to live a bad experience. First of all nothing has price has all the menu up but you do not know the prices. Second and the main thing the birria was old had bad taste and the meat was well derailed. The very kind people. Good service, bad taste. Never again.

Este Domingo fuimos a probar la birria  porque teníamos muy buenas recomendaciones y nos tocó vivir una mala esperiencia. En primer lugar nada tiene precio tiene todo el menú arriba pero no sabes los precios. Segundo y lo más principal la birria era vieja tenía mal sabor y estaba la carne bien desbaratada. Las personas muy amables. Buen servicio, mal sabor . Nunca mas vuelvo.<//Text>

<Text>I had my screen replaced for $140. When I picked up the phone i noticed the screen had a brown tinge and black spots. the screen looked as if it was not even meant for the phone. A few days later the screen started coming apart from the device, I took it back and he said he had fixed the problem but the screen still had issues and the next day went completely black. i called and asked him to fix it again but said id have to pay for a new screen.  Do not waste your time.</Text>< rating>

Only good thing I can say is that he fixed my screen same day. Phone had a cracked screen but all other functions intact. Brought it in and on replacement the new screen does not line up, clearly not fit and sealed correctly. Also the speaker when talking on the phone no longer worked upon picking up phone. Was working fine when I called him on my phone to make the appointment. Claims speaker was damaged when the screen was cracked. Cmon man you know thats not true. Like most I was in a hurry to get my phone fixed but do yourself a favor and wait if necessary bc if you take your phone here it will be an inferior repair.</Review>

I'm not sure why this place has such high reviews. While the speed is nice, the quality of the service is anything but. We've had 4 phone screens replaced as a family, all of which have either resulted in yet another broken screen, or faulty hardware (ex. buttons, finger print sensor, camera). I took my s10+ in for a replacement, and two days later I notice a fracture in the corner of my screen; another day passes by and the small fracture has now splintered across the entirety of my phone. A little funny considering I hadn't left my house during the entire incident and managed to only charge my phone once, an indication as to how little it was being used. I never once dropped it, sat on it, placed it upside down, etc. All 4 of our screens are now cracked once again, and our warranty with Samsung (which we were told by the owner of the store was nonexistent), has expired. If you have a Samsung phone, make sure its not already covered by warranty before getting anything replaced on it, dont just try and find the next best option because you're in a rush. If its not covered, take the extra time to find a trained and verified samsung dealer that does repairs, you'll be glad.< /Text>

The last time I went there I came in to fix my iPad the had a cracked screen with the button still working and the next day I came the guy tell my I fixed but one problem is that the button doesn’t work and he just gives it back to me without giving me a discount or anything. And his excuse on the button not working was “oh probly when you dropped it the button stoped working”  even though when I was showing him the iPad I was pressing the button and he was pressing the button when I was showing him when it was cracked.< /text>

I love Niles Phone Repair! I used Niles years ago for a screen replacement and was happy with the results.

Recently, I needed a new battery for my iPhone. After making an appointment at Best Buy for this to be done, I showed up to find that it would be a 2-3 hour wait. I’m not sure what the appointment did for me? I didn’t have the time for this, so I left.

It was then that I remembered Niles. Found that he had a storefront now, so I called about my battery replacement. They assured me it could be done. I asked how long it would take. They said about 10 minutes, unless it was busy, in which case it would take 20. Did I need to make an appointment? Not necessary, they said, just drop on by.

Came in the next day. Super friendly and courteous, as I remembered, and they seemed a little busy, but I was assured it wouldn’t take more than 20 minutes. They also coached me on some battery tips, and let me know to come right back if I encountered any problems.

The cost was $9 more than Best Buy, but for the convenience, it was an easy decision. Was in and out in the promised 20 minutes.

One thing: they are cash only. I never carry cash, so I had to run to an ATM</Text>

Was very disappointed with the quality of my phone repair. The back is spotted two different colors because of the high amount of glue they put in the phone. Also, they had to redo the back because the first time it was splitting before I left the store.< /text>

Fast, easy battery replacement. When I say fast, I mean 10 minutes or less. Very polite! I would not hesitate to recommend Niles to anyone. Price was right.

If I had used staples, they would have sent it out and charged twice as much and no telling how long it would have taken.

Be aware that on Sundays they don’t open till 10 am though internet says 9 am< /Review>

<Review>The best place to repair your phone and get some really good accessories. These guys are very friendly, professional, helpful and willing to go the extra mile to help you. They got some used phones for sale too. They have extremely reasonable prices and I'd say probably the best around. They fixed my iPhone very fast and charged much much less than other places and repair shops. They are honest and excellent at customer service. It was close to 100 degrees outside and thirsty and just took it on themselves to bring me a cold water bottle.They have definitely earned my business.  Thank you Nile!Kudos!</Review>< Date>

Texted owner and he quoted me 59 dollars and go in for the repair and than is quoted 235. Still have text. Dont recommend it. Get it done by an authorized facility. It's alot more economical to buy another device than have it repaired.</text>

Nile is very friendly and helpful. Always willing to give free quotes and give honest advice if the phone is worth repairing. That's rare these days and much appreciated. If you need your phone fixed, come here and give him your business. We need more shop owners with good business ethics like this.</Review>

Can't say enough good things about Nile's phone repair. I had him make two separate repairs on my husbands phone, a cracked screen repair and a battery repair. It's been maybe a month and his phone is working great. Nile is also a cheery, friendly person and has fair prices! Would definitely recommend his services!< /review>

This place has such high reviews, and I’ll grant them the fact that they are quick. But I have a Samsung Galaxy S7. The screen was destroyed. They charged me $200 to fix it. And the next day it doesn’t work at all. The screen is blacked out completely. I don’t know what’s they did to it, but do not go here. They will rip you off. And you can only pay in cash without getting a receipt.< /text>

I've been going to Jenny and not only is she super gentle but she's also really funny and easy to talk to. She makes me feel super comfortable! I buy the student pass (buy 3 get one free) and it's such a great deal.

I had never gotten a Brazilian wax before but wanted to give it a shot. I looked at a lot of different places on Yelp and decided to go with Carla.
It was a wonderful experience and I just made my second appointment! I would definitely recommend Carla for all your waxing needs - she was fabulous!!!</Text>

<text>This was my first Brazilian wax and it definitely won't be my last. Carla walked me through the process and made me feel at ease every step of the way. She is such a sweetheart and has the ability to make you feel really comfortable.

<rating>1</rating><review>Pretty terrible experience. Went in for a face peel. General feeling of dirtiness - robe had weird spots on it, hair band was so old that it was grey and the Velcro didn’t stick. Instead of getting a new one, the aesthetician just removed it. General incompetence during the procedure as well - didn’t seem like she knew how to use the tool, scratched up my face. Every step felt uncomfortable and awkward. Avoid this place.<//review>< Pictures>

<response>{'time': 1600732238856, 'text': "HI Karolina, We are sorry we had such a terrible experience. We try our best to throw away old robes and headbands and some are missed. I've gone ahead and discarded any that are visible old/stained. All the towels, linens, robes, and headbands are washed with hot water and bleach so no worries on cleanliness.  Many of the enzymes stains are hard to remove. We'll work with the esthetician(s) to remedy the issues you mentioned and avoid in future. We invite you to come back in the future to have a better experience. Have a great day!"}</response>< Gmap_id>

I went to get my eyebrows done here last August before my wedding and I had a fantastic experience. The location is beautiful and the facilities are great- very calming and peaceful. Erika did a fantastic job on my eyebrows, interpreted what I had said and made recommendations for a brow shape that better suited my face. Overall, I was very impressed! I also reviewed a friend to Erika for a facial and she had rave reviews. Can't wait to go back for more!<//Text>

<text>I had an appointment this December. It was easy to find, and warm and cozy in the spa.
The gal who helped me was very professional, and explained everything she was doing.
It was an hour appointment, a 90 minute appointment might have been better, it seemed to pass so quickly. The table is heated which was a nice benefit. It was a little tricky to book an appointment which was about 3 weeks out.
I would recommend Skincare by Erika.<//text>< Pics>

I'm addicted!! I got my first ever facial here on Saturday with Everett. He was so gentle but also thorough, explaining every product he was using and was very patient about answering my questions. He asked about my diet and lifestyle too, which i appreciated because those definitely affect the skin too.
My skin looked (and still looks) so amazing after. I seriously am addicted already<//Text>

<text>I originally came here with a Groupon for a facial and liked it so much I bought a package. Everyone here is very knowledgeable and friendly. I also really liked the products they used, especially since they were natural. They don't try to push their products on you though I did end up getting a couple because I saw good results.

I usually go here for Brazilian waxes but have done a couple of their facials. All their estheticians are friendly and do a fantastic job. I find that they spend a little extra time plucking the little hairs that the wax missed, which I appreciate as some of the other places I have gone to don't pay as much attention to the details. They offer you tea the moment you step in and appointments always start on time. They are efficient and do a fantastic job consistently.</Text>

<text>Getting a facial at Skincare by Erika is always a treat. It's relaxing, the products are plant based and smell great, the rooms are a nice size and the staff is wonderful. The Deluxe Micro & Peel Facial, with an enzyme-based peel, is a treat for your skin. You will leave feeling refreshed and happy with how you look. As about getting sets of 5 in a discount package and go every 45-60 days, then see and feel the difference.</text><user_name>Melissa King< /user_name>< time>

Very cute and clean facility, nice ladies working in there. I just don't go there anymore because the girl doing my Brazilians said I could cut back to every 8 weeks, but didn't tell me that would mean a higher price per session. Overall though, I would still recommend them to others.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< user_id>

I have been going to Alison at Skincare by Erika for the past year and she is amazing!  I would highly recommend her services (and have done so) to anyone who is looking for an effective yet gentle facial. Alison has deep knowledge of skin, products and methods and will work with you to figure out the right treatments.< /Text>

I just recently moved to the bay area and work in San Francisco. I've received waxing services here and love it! They're quick, clean, and easy. It's difficult to find places that are open beyond working hours; however, Skin Care by Erika can fit into your busy schedule. I have also been on a lunch break. Everyone is professional and polite. The price is reasonable for the services provided.< /review>

<review>Ria did such a great job on me, while my face was being taken care of she went the extra mile and gave me a hand massage which was much better than what I get at my nail salon.  I left feeling rejuvenated looking and feeling younger. I would recommend them to anyone . even if you've never had a facial this would be a great place. I've mentioned it to my customers and co-workers as a great rejuvenation. Great downtown location. This would make a great Christmas gift.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Any type of wax you get will be as great of an experience a wax can be.  They are efficient, thorough, and most importantly, extremely clean.

I have gotten a product from them (PFB Vanish - it works), but I've never felt like I was being pushed to buy anything. The office is also clean, centrally located, and I've never had to wait past my appointment time.

I've been seeing Ariel lately and she's fantastic - really thorough, and she actually makes the whole experience pleasant, which is not easy to do!</Text>

I've had a couple of treatments at Skincare by Erika.  I've had a microdermabrasion and Erika was great.  Really thorough in her assessment of my skin.  My favorite treatment though, has to be my spray tan.  It was fast and the color was incredible and lasted for a few weeks.  The woman (and I'm so sorry I can't remember her name) was incredibly professional and made me feel very comfortable. I purchased their package, because this will be the only way I tan now.  Helpful note, they do late appointments.  If you drive, schedule shortly after six, that's when all the meters change downtown so parking was a breeze!<//text>

Going to Skincare by Erika is the best treat I give myself.  I drift off into another world and an hour later I am shinny like a mirror and feeling rejuvenated.  I always buy the package so as to get more facials for my money and it is the best investment in me !!!!< /text>

<Review>I have been coming here exclusively for my skincare needs. I always get the Micro with the peel. The treatment is relaxing and your skin looks fabulous afterwards. I also use the Rhonda Allison line and my skin has never been healthier. So come see Erika and crew because they will definitely help you look younger and keep you skin beautiful.< /Review>< rating>

They try to up sell you several times during the treatment and have signs posted with even more ads for products and additional services. It's more of a clinical experience as opposed to a relaxing/tranquil experience, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just don't expect to feel super soothed and relaxed at the end.<//review>< rating>

<text>Friendly staff and great results. I got a bikini wax and subtle spray tan before my wedding in February and was very happy with them both after I left. No red bumpiness from the wax and the spray tan was natural looking and faded really well. Would've rated 5 stars but the waxing seemed a little haphazard and was more painful than other places I've tried. The results were great, but the process was long and less efficient than some other girls I've had. Overall, a good experience though!<//text>< gmap_id>

I had a wonderful experience, I walked out of there like a newer, brighter person...
From the moment I came in, from the timely appointment, from the sooth music and erica telling me everything she was doing, what products she was using and what it's doing to my face.. I felt like I could trust her. She really knows what she's talking about, the products are a bit pricey but it's because it works! I'd highly recommend checking this place out, everyone here was wonderful and very warm welcoming.</Review>

I wanted to give an update on this spot - I have been coming here consistently since I made my return visit in 2014. My skin has never looked better since I started getting facials here (about once every quarter or more).

The secret is to get a facial package which, while painful to pay for up front, gives you an insane deal on the price of your facials overall. They are good for a year and I think you get 5 in a package.

So worth it if you are looking to make this a semi-regular part of your routine. I have recommended this place to all of my friends and will continue to do so!<//Review>

<text>I had a wonderful time at Skincare By Erika. I had a relaxing facial with microdermabrasion. The office was nicely decorated and my treatments were fantastic! My facialist, Ever, did a wonderful job of explaining each step of the treatment. He was very friendly, professional, and gave me some great skincare tips! This was my first microdermabrasion experience, so I was a little scared, but he reassured me it would be fine. The treatment wasn't painful at all and I noticed an immediate difference in the look of my skin. I would definitely recommend Skincare by Erika to my friends!< /text>< pics>

Got a Groupon years ago and never stopped coming - this has been my favorite place to get facials and Brazilians hands down. I've had really acne-prone skin my whole life and I needed to find something that would really work for me; they take care of you and make sure you have the right treatment for your skin. The staff is lovely and they are very meticulous. Also their products are really amazing, they've helped my skin so much. Also they made me never wanna do my own eyebrows again cause now I just go there!<//text>

I've been to quite a few places to get Brazillians, and Skincare by Erika is hands down the cleanest place I've been with the most professional people. I highly recommend coming here for waxing. Not only was it not painful (I didn't have to pop a pill beforehand), but the waxing came out great---did not have growth 3 days later.<//Text>

Skincare by Erika offered a Living Social special, but I would've gladly paid full price for the professional, kind and indulgent facial experience I received there by a real pro! Rather than sell products through the facial session, the room was quiet and I was allowed to drift into oblivion. Very pleasant for sure.</text>

I absolutely love this clinic, Ariel helped me with my services and allowed me to extend my facial credits a bit longer due to my overseas traveling.  Not to mention they're customer service is outstanding but their facials are the best…left my skin glowing and refreshed.  I do miss this clinic and wish i wasn't so far!<//Review>

I got a groupon for a facial and peel and it was great! I like that we discussed my expectations from the service and what I wanted to achieve in the long term. My technician, Alli, was really helpful. She made me feel relaxed and answered all my questions.</review>

I recently had a facial and my first microdermabrasion. I no longer have dry patches on my face and it remains to be soft and smooth.  I enjoyed this process and results so much that I plan to have another one at Erika's in a few weeks!</text>

<Text>I came here for an emergency wax when I was visiting SF. They were professional, attentive and adept. Waxing is never really a pleasant experience, but I left there with nothing but good thoughts. The wax was virtually painless and done quickly, which is all I ask for. When I eventually move back to SF, I will definitely be returning.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Had the best facial at Erika's Skin Care. She was professional, thorough, capable and very sweet. I was very impressed by her knowledge and capabilities. It was a wonderful, soothing experience and my skin looked fabulous afterwards. I would highly recommend Erika to anyone wanting to get an excellent facial.< /Review>< Pictures>

I go once a month for a wax. Appointments are booked and confirmed online. Ask for Maisha (esthetician #7), she's a sweetheart and makes having a wax a pleasant an experience as possible.  Plus she's funny and good to talk to.  The location is pretty and easy to get to especially if you are downtown.< /Review>

The extractions were very light and fast, about 10 minutes max.  I would have liked to have more thorough extractions done, as well as more intense microdermabrasion.  The first 20 minutes were spent talking about products instead of doing the actual facial.  I was disappointed by the experience.< /Text>

I discovered this place on Groupon and had a great experience. The place was very clean and they used great products. The wax was similar to sugaring but much cheaper and fairly painless. My esthetician was very professional and welcoming. I've recommended this place to others and would definitely come back. Location is also prime!</Text>

The atmosphere is calming and the providers seem knowledgable. I appreciate that they gave me a spiel about products that would work for my skin type after my facial, but that there was no pressure to buy. It's not upscale, but my face was soft and fresh when I left.<//Review>

I had my first facial and microdermabrasion treatment at Skincare By Erika and I loved it!  Erika is very friendly and can explain everything that you ask about. The whole experience was very relaxing, informative, and helpful - it has helped me start loving my skin again and I feel like I have finally started on the path to actually healing my skin problems. Thank you Erika!</review>

<Review>I bought a groupon for a signature sfacial In Jan 2016 and loved the experience. I had never been a client before, but the facial was a perfect mix of relaxing for my mind and reinvigorating for my face. I was eager to buy one of the products she used ( a yummy pumpkin scrub) but I was never pushed into the purchase.< /Review><name>Patricia D</name><gmap_id>0x808f7fcb00000001:0x473999a8079f3e7e</gmap_id><Rate>5<//Rate>< UserId.>

I really liked my brazillian and armpit wax at Erika.  I got a groupon deal and it was extremely easy to book the appointment.  I work in the south bay, so I don't get back to the city until later, but they always have appointments that suit my schedule.  The ladies there are super warm and helpful.  And they are always offering deals and packages.  I would definitely go back once I'm back from work travel.</review>

Got a Brazilian and under arm wax by Ria. Painless!!!! She was very informative and friendly. I pre-purchased a facial and can't wait for it. I love the emails I get from them with coupons and specials, because they can be a bit pricey. But service is great! No complaints.< /Review>

The mask that was used started to burn my skin and they immediately took it off, however, they didn't have another sensitive skin mask to put on. Isn't that one of the most important parts of the facial? My skin looked great afterwards but I feel like that I was short changed by not having an alternative to the mask portion.<//review>< resp>

I came here with a Groupon and will definitely come back if I can get another one. I was pleasantly surprised how fancy it was based on the price I was paying for a facial. The place was completely empty, so I felt a little awkward. But all in all, I had a pleasant experience and a pretty good facial. I have tough skin, so I don't get many facials. In the end I'm glad I got one here.< /review>

I am always scared to try facial treatment because of my sensitive skin. Me and my husband decided to try facial treatment for our anniversary presents for each other. I found Skincare By Erika from Groupon. I called to make an appointment, and I was really surprised how nice they were. They really were very accommodating for the date and time I was looking for. The facial was really a great experience, especially because they really paid so much attention about my sensitive skin and facial redness. I loved the smell of all the skin products that they used. In addition, Erika and all the other aesthetician were nice and friendly. My husband and I decided to get each a facial treatment package to continuously pamper and take care of our skin since we found a great place like Skincare By Erika.< /Review>

<Text>I used a Groupon for a facial. Scheduling an appointment was easy and no-frills - everything was done online.

The spa ambiance was quite basic - don't expect Burke Williams, but everything was clean and tidy.

My facialist was very friendly and was very knowledgeable about skincare. So much so that she sold me on an additional eye treatment!

I met Erika and she explained their special packages, but I didn't feel pressured to purchase.

All in all it was a positive experience.</Text><user_name>Nancy Tao< /user_name><Rating>4<//Rating><date>1424974429768<//date>< Gmap_id>

I  stumbled upon this wonderful place by buying a Groupon for a facial and micro-dermabrasion.  I have oily, sensitive skin with fine lines and deeper wrinkles.  After the first treatment, I was amazed at the results.  I now go for a facial every 6 weeks and I use the skincare regimen they recommended.  My skin has NEVER looked better.  My pores are smaller, my skin is smooth.  My acne is non existent.  Even my deeper creases on my face have improved.  Erika is very knowledgeable and a great business owner.  When I called asking about one of the products they recommended and my reaction to it.  Erika had me come in to evaluate and gave me a free treatment to resolve the issue.  I have had many facials in the past, but this is by far the best experience I have ever had and the results are remarkable.  I will be a life long customer.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>The facial experience was average if not slightly above average.  They have their own line of skincare products that they use.  The esthetician's technique was ok, not as thorough with extractions or smooth with the application of products as facials that I have gotten in past at other places.  I wish he gave me individualized suggestions and advice on my skincare regimen and products instead of vague responses.  I don't have anything bad to say but I don't have anything great to say about the facial which is why I'm giving it 3 stars.<//review>< username>

I went here because it was recommended and I saw a Groupon deal. I got the deep pore cleaning facial and it was okay. The aesthetician could have done a better job cleaning my pores. Some of the pores were left half clean and turned into pimples. It was a 60 minute facial but she spent 40 minutes on my face. On the plus side, its a clean facility, she gave me shoulder massages while my masks were drying and was friendly over all.</Review>

Friendly, professional and clean. Reasonable prices, especially if you get a package, and they send out deals frequently to the email list. The estheticians really push their line of products and additional services, which can feel a little awkward, but I do like that they explain each step of what they're doing and what issues they are trying to address with the specific products they're using.< /text>

I went to Skincare by Erika with a Groupon for a brazilian wax. I had a great experience - the wax was painless, easy, fast, and good quality. The only reason I give four stars rather than five is that I thought the team tried to push me too much to buy some of their skincare products, even though I was not interested. Otherwise, wonderful experience!<//Review>

I got a facial from Skincare by Erika and the experience was very nice! The atmosphere was relaxing and clean. I also purchased a Clarisonic Mia from her...I had some trouble contacting Clarisonic because of a product defect, but Erika completely handled that for me when she heard about my difficulties. Great experience and am a satisfied customer!<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I’ve been going to Skincare by Erika for waxing and facials and I have to say the quality of the service is Excellent. Waxing is fast and painless, the wax is high quality too. As for the facials, they are the best, they use the Clarisonic to exfoliate and all the products are high quality too, they also provide a complimentary makeup service with the facial. Ria has been fabulous every time I’ve gone and I’m looking forward to my next visit. Thank you Skincare by Erika!<//Review>< GmapID>

I'm just saying make sure you feed your meter for that hour or park in a parking garage because you will get a ticket for sure I saw like 3 meter maids patrolling!

The location has only 3 employee's so its a little hard to get an appointment but if you call in they are always welcome to help =) I was a little scared to give my credit card information but everything fell into place =]< /Text><user>100942564306912065890< /user><gmapID>0x808f7fcb00000001:0x473999a8079f3e7e</gmapID></record>

I came to Skincare by Erika with a deal (either groupon or livingsocial).
Services were prompt and good. Convenient location.
The reason why I am not a huge fan is that I felt the place was a little too sparse and clinical for my taste. I prefer spas to have a more low light and soft feeling.</review>

<Review>I had a groupon deal for a facial and it was a great experience. Definitely going back. The place was clean and had a very relaxing feel to it. Ria, esthetician #4, was professional and delightful. She took her time--a whole 1.5 hours--and gave me a nice hand massage while my peel set. She answered all my questions and offered tips for skincare. I highly recommend it. My skin feels great!< /Review>< Pics>

I am new to facials. My skin is usually all good but it is showing signs of dullness and aging so I thought I would give it a try in December, before the holidays. I had a GroupOn coupon for a facial but I ended up - at the gentle recommendation of the specialist - asking for a microderm abrasion too. I was worried my skin would flare up, because I am pretty sensitive. My skin looked great the moment I walked out the door from Erika's - bright, healthy, no problem whatsoever. I have not had a chance to return yet but I plan on getting a facials package deal whenever I have a chance!</Text>

I had a groupon deal for a micro dermabrasion.  Great experience.  They catered to my skin's needs and requests, and I left feeling that my skin was very clean.  I also felt that they were not skipping steps because it was a groupon bought facial, which was nice.  Overall, I enjoyed the experience and would return.< /text>

Went here for a brazilian a few times with different people. Overall the workers were very friendly and talkative. You wait in the lobby until you are met by your esthetician who takes you to your room to do your procedure. They use a blue wax that apply with a wooden stick, which hardens up and they they pull! It gets less painful the more you go and you do get a discount if you go there regularly, but if you don't (more than 6 weeks), they'll charge you as if you were a first time customer. They also pluck hairs that wasn't taken out by the wax. My only complaint is that every single person seemed to be pushing their products at the end of the session, or pushing their deals at the end.< /text>

Initially went here for the first time through a groupon deal for a facial and I am super glad that I did. The esthetician that worked on my skin was fantastic and did a good job of explaining the steps and purpose of what she was doing while still making it a relaxing experience. She suggested some add-ons to the facial and showed me some products afterward, but it was far from the pushy sales approach I've encountered at other spas. I was so pleased that I ended up booking my next appointment on the spot (which I rarely do). My skin looked amazing immediately afterward too, with no downtime despite having a peel. Highly recommend that you check this place out!< /Review>

I have had a facial and brazilian wax here. I can honestly say Erika provides one of the best services in San Francisco. I had a deep pore cleansing facial with micro dermabrasion, and my skin looked fabulous. If it wasn't for my busy travel schedule, I would book with her more frequently. The facial left my skin glowing and I loved that she kept me informed about all of the products she used.

The brazilian wax was thorough, fast, and left my skin without a lot of irritation. I would recommend this place!<//Review>

I don't often get facials; I feel they are kind of a splurge and I can take care of my own skin, thank you very much. Plus I have sensitive skin that I don't trust to just anyone, but when I learned of Skincare by Erika through a deal on LivingSocial and read several positive reviews about her services, I decided to give it a try. I was impressed by her knowledge and by the results of the microdermabrasion facial she performed. My skin glowed for days but it was not irritated or red and it didn't break out. The office was not a zen spa and not a doctor's office, but clean and comfortable and perfectly adequate for the facials and other services performed. Erika was terrific, informative, friendly and answered all my questions. I am a believer and definitely looking forward to the next time!</text>

I made an appointment for a brazillian wax and a facial. I thought it was a joke that my brazilian wax appointment was for a full hour. But it definitely took up the whole hour! The technician was extremely anal looking through a magnifying glass and plucking specific hairs. It was so painful. I'm of the belief that the best brazilian waxes are 15 minutes....going through that process for a full 60 minutes is just cruel and unusual punishment. The weirdest part to was that the technician asked if her boss could come in (presumably after) to check her work citing that they wanted to make sure things were of the highest quality and customers were happy. She came in looked straight at my bikini area and told the technician she did a great job, then she looked at me. It was quite odd. If they really wanted to focus on customer satisfaction, they'd have the technician leave the room and let ME describe how my service went. I don't remember the facial because of the traumatic experience after.  Regardless to say, I have not been back.

Though I do have a friend who goes regularly and who has had a way different experience than me. So my advice would just be to research your technician before you get there.< /review><Rate>2</Rate><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Time>

I am a Groupon customer, but was not treated as such.  In my past experiences as a Groupon customer: 1) I either get really bad services, or 2) you get what you pay for.  I've been to Skincare By Erika once and I would have to say scheduling an appointment was a breeze.  The place was clean and staffs were very friendly.  It's a place I would definitely come back even without a Groupon.  I was very happy with how quick, efficient, and easy the who process/services was.</text>

I first came to Skincare by Erika on a groupon and kept going back! It was a great waxing experience and mostly not painful. I was a returning customer for nearly 2 years before I moved to NY. Definiteley recomend this place if you are in the Bay Area and want a good waxing experience!< /Review>

<time>1487289045558< /time><review>I tried out Skincare by Erika because of the Groupon deal they were having. When I went to the office, I upgraded my regular facial to a microdermabrasian facial. Overall, the facial was nice and I felt taken care of. Didn't really see too many results afterwards but from what i heard, it's important to do these once every 1-2 months so maybe i just need to continue. They told me about a promotion they were having that was 5 sessions for a discounted price...i originally took it but then cancelled as i found another facial place that i've liked more. Would probably only go back if there was a special promotion...otherwise i would try other places<//review>< userid>

The esthetician was very knowledgeable and super nice. I noticed that my hair grew back faster than usual so I think she broke a lot of the hairs off instead of getting the root.< /text>

<Review>I have been getting microdermabrasion facials at Skincare By Erika for a few months now.

I highly recommend her for facials and waxing. I've used nothing but the Rhoda Allison products and I love them. But SBE's coming out with their own product line so as I'm finishing up the RA products I still have, and I'll be using the SBE products I recently purchased. I couldn't be happier with the place, staff, and products :-)< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Text>I've been to Skincare by Erika twice so far - once from a Groupon deal and one follow up appointment (both for Brazilian wax).   I found making appointments incredibly easy, the staff courteous, and my aesthetician, Ria, amazingly friendly and skilled.  I've never had such a quick, painless wax and very little redness after (not to mention less hassle during the regrowth).  Highly recommended, a lot of service for the price poiint< /Text>< Name>

<Text>I had a groupon, and it was my first time at Erika's.  I liked the price (cheap even w/o a groupon) and location, and Erika was very nice.  I had an ok time with my wax - the esthetician made me feel a bit chastised for waiting to come in, and I think the wax was a bit too hot, and it slightly burned or irritated my skin.  When I told the esthetician I thought the wax was too hot, she said something like "No this is how it is supposed to be."</Text>< date>

I came to know skin by erika through a groupon deal. I was excited to try this salon so I bought a coupon from groupon.
To make an appointment for any kind of service they provide there customers two options call on a phone number or through there website. I am a busy lady so I always find calling a phone is the fastest method of making an appointment. But alas after trying to get connected via phone several time but no body picks up and always the calls get directed to there automated recorded message which says go to there website. I end up booking an appointment through there bad bad website. There website make you fill up a long form and then you come to know that you will get the earliest appointment no earlier than a week.  I booked it one and then I realized I picked up a wrong date. So I tried to reschedule it online through there website. Alas! what a horrible experience that website don't have a feature to reschedule your appointment. Then I tried to call the phone number again to reschedule it and again the answering machine picked up. Telling me to go to the same bad website or send them an email  on a different email address which is at yahoo if I want to cancel any appointment. but i want to reschedule it. So to reschedule it i now have to send an email to them to cancel an existing one and then reschedule it by again going to there bad website to find the availability.
i wonder why they make so hard for the customers before even trying there service.
Simple booking and rescheduling of an appointment with them has taken so much of effort/ energy and my time. I am already burnt with this experience that I am scared to even try there service. I am planning to even cancel my groupon and get my money back. if you have time and energy then deal with them otherwise dont waste it.</Text>

I had the best facial of my life over the weekend. I bought a Groupon for a 60 minute facial and scheduled an appointment. I didn't particularly like their online system, but when I had to reschedule, they were very helpful over the phone.

Ariel was AMAZING! She is extremely knowledgeable, friendly and professional. She identified my skin type, told me what products I should be using, and helped me develop a pre-wedding facial plan. The products that were used on my face smelled and felt great, and when she asked if I wanted a microdermabrasion upgrade, I said yes. It was my first time having microdermabrasion done, and I really enjoyed it! After the facial, I asked if she had time to do some waxing, and thankfully she did. I had my underarms waxed for the first time, and I'm so glad I had Ariel do it, she's such a pro! The wax that they use is a lot less painful that the normal stuff that you get at nail salons.

After my facial and waxing, Ariel showed me all of the products that she used and explained what each product did. There wasn't any pressure to buy anything, but I ended up buying a starter kit just to see if I liked the line. I will definitely be going back every month for  a wax and a microdermabrasion facial!< /Text>

I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.

I first heard about Skincare by Erika through Groupon and I thought, "$50 for a facial? Why not?"  To be honest, at that point, I wasn't much of a facial enthusiast nor have I even had more than 2 facials in my life, but I knew I did want to start taking better care of my skin.  Skincare by Erika had me pleasantly surprised.

Going in, I didn't really know what to expect.  Melissa was my original esthetician and she made the new experience very easygoing.  While Melissa did a great job in making me feel comfortable and relaxed, what made me come back was the GLOW that I noticed the day after.  I knew this was something I wanted to continue on doing.  I had the delux microdermabrasion and peel.  On the website, it states that it "Includes skin analysis, cleansing, a customized fruit enzyme peel for your skin type, the microdermabrasion treatment, extractions, a finishing mask and a neck, shoulders and décolleté massage."

Now, they have me hooked!  I am an avid facial enthusiast.  Ria is currently my go-to esthetician (Melissa no longer works there).  While I was a little apprehensive about switching estheticians (will she know what to do with my skin? Does she know how my skin reacts to different products?) Ria made the transition SO SMOOTH and SO WONDERFUL.  Ria is extremely experienced and knowledgeable and definitely very pleasant to talk to.  HER MASSAGES. ON MY FACE (to work the product in). ON MY SHOULDERS (to pass time while we let the product sit [Ria never sits idle; she is always making sure you get your full hour's worth of service]).  Very, very relaxing and you can tell she knows what pressure points to hit.  I always leave there telling myself that I need to pamper myself more (Because I deserve it!)  I currently hold the package deal, where 5 sessions come out to be $400 (which is $80 per session, not including tip).  Just FYI the Groupon deal is only valid for first-time users.  However, for that amount of money, I would say that it's worth it.  I look forward to my monthly sessions with Ria and I know that I'm paying good money for a good product.  My skin used to be blemished, dull, and full of scars (from acne).  Now, it is much smoother, brighter, and less congested.

Make your appointment with Skincare by Erika! This is a must and your skin will thank you for it!<//Text>

< Review>
I love Skincare by Erika.  I've had probably 12 or more facials there, as well as additional services such as brow waxing, lash and brow tinting, and a few others.  I love the Rhonda Allison products, especially the brightening scrub that smells of sandalwood.  Erika is a very skilled, knowledgable and personable aesthetician, and she has always been very sensitive to my financial challenges, offering me more affordable options when I can't afford the top of the line services.  The office is professional yet welcoming; I love the golden buddha face in one of the rooms.  I can't speak for any of the aestheticians except for Erika herself, because I always schedule with her, but as the owner of the business, I expect that she runs a very professional ship with high standards..  I don't like having to park in a parking lot, but if I plan ahead, I can easily take muni.  I definitely recommend Skincare by Erika.</Review>

<Text>Powertron seems to have the best prices in Orange County for your battery needs. Very helpful staff and very knowledgeable. They actually tried to talk me out of the batteries I wanted to purchase, and sell me a less expensive battery that would better suit my needs. You don't usually experience that these days< /Text></record>

Excellent Service by Juan and Craig was informed to purchase Battery here at Powertron and have Warranty for 36 Months for Battery, if within 1 year anything wrong with Battery I can receive a Free Battery if later than a year can get pro-rated for 24 months and (only pay half to replace for a New Battery). Thank You 😊..  I also remember as a child my Father would visit

<Review>The last time I bought a battery it was from powertron a little over four years ago time to get a new battery started searching for prices only one that came close was Walmart and I'm not so sure about their batteries the longevity one of my friends at Home Depot tell me about Powertron battery company I had forgotten about that place I called them up the price was unbelievable and then it dawned on me this was a place I bought my battery before drove out to their place in Santa Ana they greeted me checked out my battery said time for new one I took all my old battery put the new one in paid for it and was a happy camper having a good battery is a lot of comfort when you go to start the car</Review></record></dataset><record>

Contrary to your statement, Powertron has never changed ownership in 55 years, and we honor our warranties, going so far as to honor them even when the customer doesn't have their receipt. The bright side to this review is that you have purchased at least 100 batteries from Powertron and that only one time did you feel slighted. This let us know that over 99% of the time that you came into Powertron you left satisfied. So we thank you for the many years of your patronage."}<//Resp><GmapID>0x80dcd85e60fa1747:0x122d60d2727f187f< /GmapID><rate>1<//rate><Text>I have been using Powertron for decades. Have purchased at least 100 batteries, along with dozens of referrals...not no more! I purchased a battery on a Saturday last week just find it DID NOT have a sufficient charge and would not start my car. I threw a charger on it for 3 days to find a red flashing error instead of a green light. This battery is defective. I called to express what happened and asked to exchange it straight across and was instantly met with resistance. I then brought the battery back just to be completely aggravated by their reluctance to take care of me. Instead I being told that the battery is good, we check them all, theirs something wrong with your car, your battery charger is broke, you do not know anything, we have been in business for 55 years... SO WHAT. So, I guess there is no way that a battery that is now made cheaply overseas could be defective. Also, Their invoice states word for word a 36 month total pro-rata, first 12 months free replacement. Good luck getting them to honor that fraudulent statement. I had to fight with the guy just EXCHANGE A 3 DAY OLD BATTERY. In fact when I bought the battery on that Saturday, a guy with a 1 year old battery could not get help also. He was told that he did not maintain the battery, he did not drive the vehicle daily... blah, blah, blah. Every word out of their mouths is speculative. Not sure how that ended up with him but he too was not happy. Not sure what has happened to Powertron. Maybe after all those years of business and now being owned by someone else is a sore spot. Don't take it out on your customers.
Thanks for the past years of service. There will be no business from me and no referrals to my friends and family.</Text>< Pictures>

I've been buying batteries from them since the early '70's. It didn't matter if it was for my motorcycles, boats, cars, or last week for my electric lawnmower, they always came through with the battery I needed. And always at a fantastic price. I hope to do business with then for many years to come and would recommend them to anyone.<//review>

R&S Appliance Services has been using  Powertron Battery Services since We initiate Ours in 1992 on 2234 with second St in Santa Ana....As neighbors. ... We moved to 709 S Anaheim Blvd in  Anaheim and We still gladly use their service Because They still go with the Same Quality Product, very competitive price, Greater and Friendly Service...I Must suggest 10 STARS for Them.....MGB.< /Review>

Best place to buy batteries.  Been going there for years, same guy still there. His hair has grayed like mine. Turns out my battery is still good, so he didn't even sell me a battery today, but we did talk about going to Italy. And he's got a good crew too. Molto buono!</Review>

Pizza is terrible my pizza had no sauce and I also got cheesy sticks 2 of the sticks didn't have cheese  and with it came a half container of watered-down pizza sauce. Don't waste your time and money< /Review>

I am completely unsatisfied with my last order. First of all, your company charges a $5 fee for even ordering your food. Then I go to pick up my $80 order and I ask for parmesan cheese and crushed red peppers and am told they are an additional $1 charge each. Completely ridiculous. You are nickel and diming people to death. I will never go back to Pizza Hut. So many more options around. Paying extra for nothing is a big turn off.<//text>

They had no plates, no plastic ware, no crushed red pepper, and no parmesan packets. At least that is what the sole person working there told me. So this store either has a poor stocking issue or unhelpful staff.<//text>

As previous review mentioned.   My 3 toppings was just enough for a quarter of my pizza.  I may as well order a cheese pizza.
I just had the same pizza made properly 2 days ago from a different location so I know how much topping it is supposed to have.</review>

Absolute  worst customer service EVER over two hours to get a pizza delivered they never showed up had to go to store and then i was lied to that it just left. Asked to talk to manager but he was too busy then all of a sudden they found my order in back!! Got home only to find out it was NOT what I ordered.</Review>

<Review>Friendly bunch of guys with sleek set up. Clean, tidy and very professional service.  Great price ranges too.  I brought my son in for a last min.walkin and they graciously took him in just before closing. Super grateful. Be sure to tip too, these types of  local & small business were forced closed during the pandemic . Were new to YC and love it here!<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVPvVEJJHDYe7dVnTlQmHZHZ80pFNzCadXwiRM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvFSGEgD4Nr4YtZhbVrqnPYMo1eY6XthCPbfpx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFu5fCuor3sS_MU4QR7kGilUfPDilM0-5jC1Ey=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I got the best basic haircut here (fade) that I’ve had in years and it kept its shape even after 2 months.  Headed back to try it again to see if they are consistently good.  Great value.<//Review>

I almost resisted reviewing this place out of selfishness because they are already so busy, but there's a reason why. It doesn't matter what barber you get to cut your hair. You will have a good cut and a great experience every time you go.</text>

Great cut, great conversation, great prices. Plan ahead cause they are always, always busy and because they do an amazing job, cuts take longer.5 Stars if they setup a simple appointment system< /Review>

Best laundry place in town. However your handicap parking is visible. But plz post towing company number. I'm tired of privileged walking citizen abusing that parking spot while people who have the handicap sign need that parking</text>

Cleanest laundromat I have ever been to. Machines are clean and well maintained. It's farther for me to drive? but well worth it.</review>

<Review>I love coming to this laundromat over the one that's 5 minutes away from my house because it's cleaner, less busy and it's rare to see anything out of order and I come here once a week for sure. It is small, but honestly that's the only downside I see to it.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80db5589b5894d83:0xba722d1b86d6b2ee</gmap_id><Rating>5< /Rating><Date>1570072406232< /Date>< response>

<Text>This place is great! They have washers for single loads as well as 2, 3, 4 and 8, and each kind is easy to find by signs. There's plenty of each kind and plenty of dryers too. It's very clean and well lit and the layout is great, no crowding or squeezing by people just to get to your stuff like some other places. It's a little further from my house than the place I normally go to, but it's so much better, I'll gladly drive a few more minutes! I am exceptionally impressed with this place, highly recommend!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1515560990071, 'text': 'Thank you for the review.

Reasonable prices & good hours. In the hot months, I recommend  going early morning or evening - no A/C. Take a water bottle. One summer evening I was washing close to closing time & no one rushed me. I really appreciated it. The ultra capacity machines get your clothes really clean.</Text>

Plenty of different sized washers and adequate amount of dryers. Since I haven't been to a commercial laundry in a long time, I cannot speak on the cost to wash and dry items. I went there to wash my extra large duvet and cover and the washer stopped taking my money and it would not return the money that I put in it. Sent a text to the number posted and the owner called me back within 5 minutes! He informed me that someone was on their way there to clean up a spill and he would assist me as well. I informed the worker of the problem, he gave me the form to complete and refunded my money. The only problem I had was that I only brought enough soap for the two loads and I had to buy more soap. 😏 I will definitely return to wash my duvet and cover again.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Clean, well maintained and if there's a problem owner/ operators are super easy to get ahold of. It's even pretty nicely decorated though not very big. Has change machine and laundry detergent and everything works. I wouldn't go anywhere else if this was an option location wise.</text>

I called the owners, and they immediately drove right out to address the issue.  When they arrived, they were very polite and respectful. They refunded the eaten money, and threw in some dryer sheets for my troubles.  While they were there, they also saw to a broken machine, addressed another customer's issue, and made sure the whole place was cleanly swept.

Very clean! And super close to places needed to keep little ones occupied while doing laundry. I hate doing laundry but don't mind coming here cause I usually am in and out, wash, dry and fold, in a little over an hour.  We refuse to go anywhere else! Plus free wifi<//Review>

This laundry facility was was too small, the smallest I ever seen. In addition to a very crowded place with few machines, the owners have several broken or missing machines so very poorly maintained. I couldn't find a machine so I left and did business around corner at a laundry facility at 1570 Orange, finding this place more spacious and with hardly anyone there.<//Review>

I RARELY express my anger towards an establishment. But if you are the owner and can’t handle a busy environment, then you shouldn’t be on the floor. As a manager myself i would not handle my customers the way this manager does. She yelled at my mom just for asking more of a specific item (pineapple). I had to put my foot down for this type of attitude. Absolutely unacceptable, get off the floor and hire more employees, stop being rude to your customers and employees.
Cooks are A+ though, the food was excellent,  except the service that was provide by the lady manager. So do what you want with this information, they get busy mo matter what. So the business is always there.< /Text>

<review>Food is usually amazing. We order yesterday 5 plates, they tasted different than usual. The beef meat did not shrink like it usually does when it cooks and we all got food poisoning. I understand businesses have been hitting hard with the pandemic but cutting corners will just make the financial situation worst I say this because I don’t know if I’ll ever eat there again.

The lady that I assume is the owner was very pushy.  Very matter of fact.  Wanted to keep the line moving as fast as possible at the cost of good customer service.  The food itself was good. Good quality cooked well.  Again the main bad thing was the owner.  She even told me to stop taking pictures.  But it's a public area so I know my rights. The stand out part was the cook.  I HATE spicy food and if you are familiar with the way the the food is cooked here, the grill is shared and the food is rotated as it's cooked.  So if some one ordered food with hot peppers, in front of you (as people do, its all good, people can eat as the wish) then your food will be spicy as well.  But I basically asked them if the could clean the grill to not spice my meal and the cook had no problem with my request.  I tipped him directly a few bucks.  I was able to enjoy my food 😁</Text>

I would think this had a better rating but the costumers are right,when it comes to management this in fact is the worth. If it wasn't that the food is soo good we wount give our money to this people. BUT A 5 🌟 TO THE COOKS,it takes skills to handle that heat.< /text>

Front two employees who are asain are extremly food. Just pointing. All staff have no smiles and just act like they dont want to be there. How they kept line for food to customers organized, you cant really tell which food is yours. Instead of you keeping the food in front of you, they made you go stand in line. This is the only mongolian I been to made you do that. Avoid, other places at mall should be better. Wish I could give 0 stars.</Review>

This place is my favorite. I visit many restaurants but here I  constantly return again and again. The crew is very chummy and the cooking they offer is so fresh and tasty. I never decline to have a nice meal in this restaurant. Highly recommended.<//text>

Asian lady upset my wife to tears when she asked for pineapple to be added after they started cooking food. She didn't care to cost or change of flavor. They refused to prepare the food the way she wanted. Apparently she told my wife to go away.  Didn't listen to her when preparing food.<//review>

I've been coming here for years. Sadly to say today was my last time. There was one grill working, to many people in line and the service was horrible. To add more, there was a cockroach crawling on the wall. I mentioned it to the manager, but he just went ahead to grab it, from the condiment area and tossed it away. Not good for health people. I'm disgusted and disappointed. I didn't get my money or food. I ran out of there as fast as I could. 🤢🤮😖</Text>

<Text>My wife likes this place says she could eat this food 7 days a week. It's a medium size place for dining in and quick service for take out. Portions are generous and of course they have plenty of choices for sauces. It gets pretty busy at certain times but the staff is very friendly 👍</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I eat here just about every time I go to this mall. I've actually gone to this mall just to eat at Great Khan's. You choose everything that goes in your bowl. You pick up pieces of frozen chicken/turkey/beef/pork/tofu, and any veggies you want. Stack that bowl as high as you can and you'll get much more than your money's worth, they cook it all in front of you with noodles and you can request they just cook with water for a healthier alternative. Try this food, you won't regret it.</Review>

< Review>
This used to be my favorite Mongolian place. But after today, I don’t think I’ll come back. It used to be so savory and rich in flavors. But the bald guy added too much water. He looked mad and he didn’t wanted to work. Maybe hire someone who’s more friendlier. He couldn’t close the lid for my friend and food was coming out of it. Food was very bland. Very disappointing!!< /Review>

<rating>3</rating><Text>So I'm giving this place a 3 starts only because I really enjoy their food however I had a bad experience with the cook and the register girl. I was next in line to get my food and when he gave me my plate I let him know that wasn't my order because it had items in it that I know I didn't choose and he just told me YES THIS IS YOUR PLATE NOW TAKE IT. I kept insisting it wasn't  and that I've been waiting in line for 20 minutes so my food can be cook and if he can look if maybe the bowls got messed up with someone elses order. He didn't even bother and kept cooking the food of others behind me,  I was in so much shock I told the register girl to just give me my money back and she rudely said no that all I can do was start over with my plate. Poor customer service on something so simple.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>The cook was impolite, rude and non-professional. The service wasn't good. They kept us waiting for a long time -about helf an hour- just because we asked to clean the grill from previous residues. I probably won't go back there again at all.< /Review>< pictures>

Huge portion for the price.  Hygiene practices all seem in order (gloves with veggies) but meats looked wierd.  Daughter had veggie only options which led to repeated questions about whether she was sure she didn't want any meat.  But she loved it< /Text>

She immediately put a glove on. Then I saw the guy cleaning the floor. He grabbed a container of meat & transfeed it to another container. He wasn't wearing gloves. When I asked for a refund she said no. We didnt eat our food. I told her I was gonna complain. & she said then stay home and cook if you don't like it.  I watched her for an hour.

I took my girlfriend here hoping to show a decent Mongolian BBQ, but we were both somewhat disappointed. The cooking took over 20 minutes, and the meats were chewy. My guess is the pieces of meat were too large.

Not as good as I remember, sadly</Text>< pics>

Where do I start the owner is crazy how about there is am writing this from my mom's phone, while sitting and eating. I truly love this food I eat it all the time in San Diego and LA and this time I found it here in the mall which I was exited about. I just had left the hospital  with my mom and she wanted to walk around the mall, I saw the place and I told her let's it here it really good, we get to cashier and the not job was there I asked for my mom a glass of water after ordering she got the water and would not give the glass to me until I paid my food, my mom was the one wanting it, so I pay for the food grab the bowl and then started putting food in it. I wanted a side of cilantro from my mom and I thought not to put it in the bowl because the guys would cook it, so I told my mom that I'll get her some on the side, so he finished cooking and I sat my mom down at the table and went back to get two pathetic strands of cilantro the nut job was with customers so I just took them on top of my napkin she started yelling on top of her freaking Lungs that I cannot take cilantro I explained That I didn't want it cooked while still screaming her husband joined her!!!!!! Omfg I wanted to put the freaking cilantro down her freaking throught!! To shut her up I gave it back to her and she just threw it in the garbage what was the point of that? I don't know I don't understand for a pathetic stand of cilantro she not only lost a loyal Customer but the whole freaking mall was looking at her and now she can look at my pretty review !!!! Never will I return!!!< /text>

Good Mongolian food, although the bowls are small, hence careful stacking is recommended. Note that their spicy is quite spicy if you like that kind of thing. In a food court, so not much in the way of atmosphere.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) I would like to put 0 star on it. The owner of that place is an arrogant, arrogant and abusive lady, I had a bad experience with my family in that place. The owner prefers to lose customers than to give good service. I do not recommend it because of the poor service it provides to customers. I already exposed it on social networks about how he treats customers. Besides, it does not use hygiene practices. 😡😡

(Original)
Quisiera ponerle 0 estrella. La dueña de ese local es una señora arrogante, prepotente y abusiva, tuve una mala experiencia con mi familia en ese local. La dueña prefiere perder a los clientes que dar un buen servicio. No lo recomiendo por el mal servicio que presta a los clientes. Ya la expuse en redes sociales de cómo trata a los clientes. Aparte no hace uso de prácticas de higiene. 😡😡</review>

(Translated by Google) Yesterday I went with my family to eat at that place and the owner did not want to replace me with some noodles that had fallen from my bowl, she also treated the employee with disrespect. I will never go back there. I have already made a complaint to the Santa Ana health department for poor hygiene practices. 😡 Rude and arrogant old woman

(Original)
Ayer fui con mi familia a comer a ese lugar y la dueña no quiso reponerme un poco de noodles que se habia caído de mi tazón, me trató con irrespeto tambien al empleado. Jamás volveré allí. Ya hice la denuncia al departamento de salubridad de santa ana por malas prácticas de higiene. 😡 Vieja grosera y prepotente< /text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Today October 23 happened at 3:00 pm, an employee dropped some noodles from a lady's set and the employee wanted to replace that bit of noodles but the owner took it off the plate and the employee scolded him. the detail but the owner did not want that noodle to be replaced: in front of the other customers and employees. It is not the first time that we see this incident in this place of the Main place of Santa Ana, several incidents have already happened and by the way they also treat the workers very badly because they always have the announcement of: “Now Hiring I will not return to this place"

<review>I ordered a $600 Wolf blender as a gift at the Pasadena, CA Lake Ave store. I was told it would be delivered by 4/2, in time to be gifted. Now it won’t be delivered until mid-April, but there was no contact by the store, no attempt to locate one in another store somewhere else in the US, just the original email that I had to search, access, and use to track the shipment status. Once at the original email I found the date was extended. I called the WS on Lake and a young man answered. He said he would try to locate one and call me back; he never called. I sent 2 emails to WS Customer Service; no response no reply no consideration. Choose wisely.</review><Date>1617120208896<//Date><Gmap_id>0x80c2c35c48a66bed:0x6ae243f795c3568d</Gmap_id><user_id>100400305839088999866</user_id>< Rate>

<Text>Sam the manager and her staffs don’t really care about customer service. I got a set of cookware at another store. It’s a final sale item due to huge discount. I got home and one of the lids is damaged and I want to the Pasadena store to see if can be replaced and I was told no because it’s from another store and it would make their item harder to sale since it will be missing a lid for their set (which is already missing 3 lids and a 3 qt sauce pan). Instead, they would break up the set and sale it individually. Overall, my experience with the Pasadena store is bad. Unlike the Thousand Oaks store. Super friendly staffs, very attentive and not trying to sale me stuff but giving me the room to think what I want to buy.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSSngi4UkLA914rO4Sf23hcRyS3A2G_K2A7VLB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c35c48a66bed:0x6ae243f795c3568d</Gmap_id></record>

There’s a lot of kitchen stuff we need. I figured I would start at WS. Walked in to an empty store, two employees and made eye contact with one. Walked around a bit and was never greeted or asked if I needed assistance. After I did not find what I was looking for I inquired about it to which I received a lazy, “we’re sold out.”. The employee seemed more interested in her phone. No date on when they might be back or further information. Wasted my time. Will gladly take my business elsewhere</Text>

So I purchased a gift card last week on July 22, the tracking app shows that the card was delivered to the address given, the confirmation email says that it was delivered, but nothing was received at the address given. After six phone calls and 4 1/2 hours of call time. I finally got them to re-issue a new card no idea when I will be getting this card, The wedding is this coming Saturday, August 1. They are trying to pin this on the post office saying that it was out of their hands, I did not receive the email from the post office as far as tracking, I received it from William Sonoma. They were quick to charge the credit card but the service is lousy. Online service is terrible,  when ordering something from their website , their delivery information is not accurate. Needless to say I don’t know if the gift card will arrive before the wedding, as I stated they were quick to charge the credit card but they love to point the finger at the other person talk about passing the buck, and throwing other people under the bus!! Admit it Sonoma, your service is below average.!!<//Text>

Always a fun place to look for kitchen gadgets. The holidays are even more fun all of the great gift ideas. The staff was helpful even though the store was really crowded.</review>

<Review>Ridiculous return procedure!  I returned some thing I bought online without printing the email receipt, they refunded me the amount totally different from what I paid.  Different purchase amount, different discount amount, totaling a random $18.60 short from the original receipt.<//Review>< pictures>

Normally I would give them 5 but at my last visit they totally lost focus on customer service.

They did not hold the right items and then forgot all about me.<//review>

Had without a doubt the best shipping experience at this Williams Sonoma!! Lani helped me purchase a new espresso machine and was so enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the products!!!  Not only was she a great SA but was genuinly kind to my girlfriend and I during our visit. Can’t wait to return. Really a pleasure shopping with her and at this store! Highly recommend shopping here.</Review>

It's William Sonoma, so everything in the store will an amazing gadget you never knew you needed in your kitchen and will cost a surprising amount of money. Even if you don't purchase anything it's an interesting walk through,.< /review>

CUSTOMER SERVICE IS UNBELIEVABLE!! IF YOU ASK THEM FOR ANYTHING, EVEN VERY SPECIFIC, THEY'RE COMPLETELY WILLING TO GO BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY. THE AMAZING YOUNG WOMAN WHO I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE HELPED  BY(WHOSE NAME IS JUST BLANK,  LONG BLONDE HAIR , FELT LIKE WE'D BEEN CLOSE FRIENDS THAT SPENT MUCH MORE TIME TOGETHER AND TALKED ABOUT 4 TIMES MORE THAN ANYTHING PHONE RELATED TOOK. I AM PLANNING ON RETURNING TO VISIT HER ACTUALLY SO I CAN COERCE HER TO HANG OUT OF THE SPRINT STORE, WE GOT ALONG BEYOND WONDERFULLY, BUT THE ENTIRE STAFF IS THE MOST ATTENTIVE AND COMPLETELY AWARE OF WHAT NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE REQUESTED AND WILL DO ANYTHING WITHIN THEIR AUTHORITY'S SCOPE TO ENSURE THAT YOU ARE 100% SATISFIED WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE AND IF I DIDN'T JUST GO BARELY 2 MONTHS AGO ID RECOMMENDED THAT LOCATION IF SPRINT/VERIZON is YOUR CARRIER! JUST WAY COMFORTABLE ENERGY AND CALM LOCATION,  NOT BUSY. MAGNIFICENT!< /Text>

I’ll keep it short and sweet. My bill did not match the quote stated in store by ~$30. The whole idea was to switch from Verizon to Sprint to have a cheaper bill. The manager wants to maintain the notion that insurance was “added after the fact” yet the whole basis of my visit was centered around my current phone having insurance as suggested by the manager. It is the reason I did not purchase a new iPhone with Sprint that day. Anyway, my suggested plan had some 4 additional lines with cheap phones to obtain the quoted bill and get some money back on prepaid cards. I was upset by the high bill, and I wanted to return the cheap phones, cancel service, and get a refund. The manager said there will be a ~$200 ($50 x 4) restocking fee as it was greater than 14 days per manager... despite sprint’s policy of “30 days total satisfaction”.

< 20 minute call with corporate I was informed that a re-stocking fee is inappropriate as I was under 30 days of service. My items have been returned with no re-stocking fee, service cancelled, and a full refund has been issued as this is the 30 day total satisfaction policy.

This is a 3rd party store. I would do business elsewhere. This store doesn’t abide by sprint’s standards.<//review>

I usually end up Judy going Walmart when I go to the Crossroads Shopping Center. I do like, though, that there are several places in the shopping center to go to. It's kind of a one-stop-shop kind of place if you have several things you need to get finished.</text>

Terrible store! Quote was lying. First 3 month charged more than $80. First month I went store to cancel service but manager said wait 3 more months then bill will go down and will credit back pay different. But 3 months later it is too late cancel service. And this store never gave back any credit. I scammed more than $240. When I visit they saying will mail gift card. But I never get that and when I call them leave me wait more than 3 hours. They are nice but don’t cares about my bill.<//Text>

I went to do some shopping @ Wal-Mart today. Everything I needed was available except for the most important, tp & some meats or cleaning supplies. There was fruits, veggies & water. Lots of supplies coming in though. All the grocery staff were helpful, courteous & the place was clean.
I would recommend going in during these tough times.<//Text>

What a horrible experience. They messed up my account.  Added another line when all I wanted was an upgrade and merge account with my daughter's. Here I am paying for two lines since Dec. And nobody there has been able to fix the problem. This is so frustrating.  I asked to talk to manager since then. I have been to that place more than 5 times already trying to talk to the manager. Not even him  is  capable enough to talk to you and give you a good response to the problem.
What a horrible experience. My Hope's now are to report then to the California Bureau of business and see what next.<//text>

The employee was incredibly knowledgeable, helpful, professional, and efficient.  All of my questions were answered thoroughly and my issues were resolved.  I was so pleased, I upgraded my phone, changed my plan, and added 2 Smart Drive devices.</text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>I should have went with Verizon; I’ll recommend you do too, or visit ANY other Sprint store. Really poor customer service. Sad! Raul is extremely unprofessional. He should reconsider returning to customers service training. He took all my questions personal and became argumentative with me. Would not provide anything in writing  when i ask to explain what he was offering.  Manager was in the store but  didn't  care to handle the situation. I walked out of the store so disappointed.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>I've had Sprint for a few years now and let me say, I'm not impressed. Although due to the area I live in I am stuck with the network. The first time I got a phone here the employee helping me put additional, unnecessary charges to my account stating that they were required in order to get the phone. Which I now know that this is a lie. For example, I I was charged for phone insurance when in fact I was not required to have phone insurance. To make things worse with that phone insurance a pin was supposed to be given to the customer (me). Thus, if my phone breaks I would give the pin number to the third party phone insurance. So, the third party insurance company can access and tell you your options regarding your account. So, sadly I unknowingly paid for the phone insurance I didn't want only to figure out I couldn't use it because the Sprint employee did not give me a pin number.
Fast forward to about a year, my phone brakes. Thus, I call the Sprint store regarding my options. To which they explain that I have insurance. Something I was not aware of prior. So, the Sprint store tells me to contact the third party insurance agency. I then contact the insurance agency and they explain that they can't do anything without a pin number. So, I then go back to Sprint telling them about the situation. To which they reply 'that's not our problem, we just sell the insurance."
A week passes and I somehow manage to cancel the insurance myself. No thanks to the workers at Sprint. I then go to the store and plan to get a new phone. Prior, I already knew the phone I wanted from the store. Only to find out that the store doesn't have the phone in stock. Th employee that was helping me (Jose) explained to me that the only phone that was in stock was the Samsung Galaxy S9. A phone way out of my price range. After telling Jose that that phone was not in my price range he walked away and left me alone. Talk about good service. He wanted to sell me the most expensive phone and since I didn't want it he decided not to help me. I ended up getting a cheaper phone (obviously). I was told it would arrive in 3 days. Being that I didn't have a phone for a week now three days didn't seem so bad. Although when paying for the phone Jose did not give me a receipt at all. Thus, I had to go back to the store to ask for the receipt only to find out that on the receipt it tells you nothing about what you paid for or the amount you paid. There were just zero's and vague statements on the receipt. I then go home and notice that on the receipt they have written the wrong contact number down (the number they will contact when the phone is at the store). Thus, I called the store and tried to clarify that mistake and the person on the phone (another Jose) seemed reluctant to help and wouldn't tell me about my transaction and if the information was correct until I started to give him attitude. He then gave me and corrected the information that was needed.
On the day that the phone was supposed to be at the store, I called the store and asked if the phone was there and they asked me for my name and they said it wasn't there. So, when I called later and asked if the phone was ready and I stated the name on the account they said that the phone has been there for days now. Thus, I went without a phone because the employees either didn't know how to read or pronounce my name. Sprint, especially this location has 0-star service. They seem like they don't want to help their customers out, forgetful, and have a general  hatred for their job.<//review><userid>116399422082828808080< /userid>< pics>

Crossroads shopping center is an okay place considering I am from out of town it's a little congested compared to shopping at the Rose in Oxnard where am I originally from. All in all it is still a great area to find the things that you need.<//Text>

Visited 4 separate stores here. Parking is a real challenge. Spots are very narrow and many shoppers parked well into neighboring spots, taking up 2 spots. The round-a-bouts, while uber easy to navigate most other places, are both frustrating and entertaining to see so many drivers who either can't or wont follow directions. This causes major inefficiencies in what is designed to be a more efficient solution to the flow of traffic. Then there are the ones who derive joy in driving around them several times, holding up even more traffic. Lots of litter, diapers, carts, etc. strewn around parking lot - sadly not surprising.< /review>

< review>
Alright is had been 4 God awful days I have been patiently waiting for stupid Sprint to unlock my phone, so that I can switch carriers, because the staff at sprint LIE to your face about what you're going to pay. The worst customer service ever! Stay away from sprint, before we signed any paperwork I asked them, "so we are NOT paying this amount right?" Because it said a much larger price than what they told us, they say, "Oh no, that's for something else, yadda, yadda..."
We ended up paying it, and when we confronted them, they said it was our fault, very unprofessional. Sprint is the Worst! I use my phone for my Business and I can't check my voicemail because of the unlock delay, terrible,  just terrible< /review>

<Text>I spent almost two hours waiting to get a upgrade. After getting the run around again and again I called the 1800 number for sprint customer service to cancel my service.  The customer service lady on the phone then asked to talk to the manager of the store. The manager of the store refused to listen to the customer service lady. Eugene I think is the managers name. He informed me that I would have to travel all the way to Santa Barbara to get the service from a "corporate" store, because he was a "independent" store. Come to find out RADIO SHACK is a corporate store(it's about two miles away). I then confront the manager as to why he would lie and say I would have to travel all the way to SB. He replied that's a "company" store, not "corporate".......I highly recommend not using this so called "independent store". Just go to radio shack on Carmen lane. It was so much easier.

I have been a sprint customer for almost 16 years. Service has consistently gone downhill since they closed the sprint/nextel store on betteravia. Please use radio shack!</Text><user>111837732574013150806<//user>< Name>

Parking is minimal and the entire place seemed crowded. Businesses cars and customers just appear to be pretty cramped up in here. If there was another coast hills on my way to my destination i wouldnt have chosen this location. Claustrophobic</text>

every time i come here they mess up my plan somehow. Yesterday the woman who helped me barely said more than 10 words to me and looked like i was annoying her with my presence. she wasn't very helpful or understanding either. they sent me off to a store in slo. once i got there they asked me why i didn't go to the one in AG instead. so i drove an hour from my home instead of 45 minutes.</Text>

I am a messianic jew. My dad was livid  when I was  17 and I had to take my Messianic Star off  b4 I could go in house. I had accepted Christ Jesus my Father"s Son, I am a CMA, retired Outlaw biker, overly maternal/overly protective, God fearing woman with an Amazing God, given more blessings, I can't believe I am still a miracle walkiing!! My military service and the kids and being able to get more 💰 for giving me to a new home and I have been given gifts of dream prophecy.  God bless you all for the prayers and support for the journey .< /review>

Sprint is the worst service.  I don't get outgoing calls.  When I use the internet I have to be on WFI because then I will not be able to go online.  Going to Sprint it was the worst I could of ever done.  Oh yeah and they lied to me saying that buy one phone and get the other free, however I get my bill and they still charge me for the free phone.  I hate sprint......<//Text>

Needs more stores. Most of the locations that originally were there are gone, leaving nothing to the left of Walmart. The location is great, but be prepared to have slow traffic XD yeah it's a slow drive if going to Walmart.< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>This shopping Center is located just off the southbound 101 freeway. It offers shopping for all ages. There is a Home Depot, Best Buy, Walmart, TJ Maxx, AT&T Wireless store and several places to dine, like Wendy's, Chuck y Cheese's for the kids and Jersey Mike's Subs. There is also a bank there for ATM users. The parking is always free and Surprise...it's actually building a stand alone building in the middle of the center that will house a Krispy Kreme Dougnut shop . Shopping for everyone and room for RV's too.<//review>< pics>

<Review>This plaza area has a large Walmart shopping center as well as the Walmart grocery shopping center. I like going to this Walmart if I have to go to Walmart because it has a larger selection than my local Walmart. However, this Walmart is always a mess, over crowded, and small un supervised  children run wild. But the employees are helpful and nice. Avoid parking at night the area is known for car theft and the parking isn't well supervised by security and needs more lighting.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Nice new development, but frustrating parking, not enough and too small spaces, and routing that puts pedestrians vs cars directly in front of stores.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) In my case I changed company, they promised me a refund for the lines that I took to sprint and they never gave it to me and every time I had to tell them that I had not received the refund they always came out with excuses and it takes hours to attend to you some flagpole they bother saying that I called customer service and customer service told me that they would have to help me, the joke is that they didn't help me anywhere. The manager enmeshes you with false promises. Terrible service NOT RECOMMENDING THIS STORE

En mi caso me cambié de compañía me prometieron un reembolso por las líneas que lleve a sprint y nunca me lo dieron y cada que hiba a decirles que no había resivido el reembolso siempre salían con excusas y tardan horas en atenderte algunos asta se molestan diciendo que llame atención al cliente y atención al cliente me decía que ellos me tendrían que ayudar,  el chiste es que por ningún lado me ayudaron. La manager te enrreda con falsas promesas. Pésimo servicio NO RECOMIENDO ESTA TIENDA< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Very bad company they make promises that they never keep and they charge more than what they say in their contract.

<review>(Translated by Google) Wonderful shop especially if you like to fiddle with. To coast and to choose and beautiful things. It makes you greedy when you get there. Well worth it

Heerlijke winkel vooral als je van fröbelen houd. Te kust en te keur en prachtige spullen. Je wordt er hebberig van als je daar bent. Zeker de moeite waard<//review>< Rating>

(Translated by Google) Good products. Terrible and expensive plans with things you do not need. It took more than 2 hours to finish what I needed. I was just going to change my wife's phone that came out defective and they insisted and pressed me to renew the contract and another phone. manager and the workers are horribly persistent when you tell them that you do not want something. With them it is not like you want, and it is to egg, to forces you have to leave the shop with internet typesetters for the car that are free, yes , putting your card in automatic payments. Bad experience the truth! I will be happy the day I change company!

Buenos productos.Terribles y caros planes con cosas que no necesitas.Se tardaron más de 2 horas para terminar lo que necesitaba.Solo iba a cambiar el teléfono de mi esposa que salió defectuoso y me insistieron y presionaron para renovar contrato y otro teléfono.La manager y los trabajadores son horriblemente persistentes cuando les dices que no quieres algo.Con ellos no es como tú quieres,y es a huevo,a fuerzas tienes que salir de la tienda con cajistas de internet para el auto que disque son gratis ,eso sí,poniendo tu tarjeta en pagos automáticos. Mala experiencia la verdad! Estaré feliz el día que me cambie de compañía!<//text>
