<Text>The staff treat everyone like family, and they're very helpful with recommendations. The food is great, the prices are low, and the full-size portions well have you asking for a to-go box. They're buffet is currently closed, but I've had good experiences with that as well.

The wallpaper in the back is falling apart a little bit, but the restaurant itself is spotless.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

One of the best chinese food places I've had, always my go to! They give large portions and are always super nice, food is usually done in about 15 minutes and priced amazing. Everyone should check this place out, 10/10.< /review>

Yesterday was the first time in this good restaurant. But It is surely not the last. We enjoyed the evening very much with the generous service, with the great  meal and booze and with the modest pay. We will definitely come back again.<//Review>

If you're hungry, for $15 you can eat your fill at this Asian buffet. Not fine dining, but filling. It's good, but not great. You come here for value. There are a few items that were really good, like the little sesame balls filled with red bean for dessert.

But over all, this is about filling up on the cheap. It was clean, quiet, the staff was friendly, and it's a pleasant experience for very little money. I basically gave it an extra star for value.< /Text>

Ok place if you want a quick spot to eat. Friendly staff. Food wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst. Not that many selection of food. The Mongolian beef section is very limited. So don't go there expecting a lot.<//review>

Customer service matters... Until today I was a regular customer. at least twice a month but I will not return. I mistakenly left my credit card in my car and told the lady I needed to retrieve it. She made a BIG scene saying loudly "do not leave I ask my Boss"... Ask your Boss what I am not asking you I am telling you, it is not like you have a choice if you want to get paid..When I returned she continued about her job and showed me the receipts for the day trying t say "these people ram away too" Never will return.<//Review>

The food is good and reasonable price. You have a nice variety selection of Asian and American food. They also have food they'll cook for you right there. But you need to be aware of the prices change according to their timetable.<//text>

Come early when everything is fresh and excellent. You will be delighted if you come before 12, and slightly disappointed when it's all been sitting out for a couple of hours

You can have an excellent, healthy and varied meal here. The key is to come early.

Definitely worth it.

I AM NOW REVIEWING AGAIN DURING TGE PANDEMIC 07/19/2020

This is the best food in Alameda right now. Tell them what you woukd like and they will make it for you fresh and hot and healthy and excell3nt in every way -- tastu, and moet importantly very very healthy. I was unable to finish it. There was enough for 3 hungry people. Plus yoy will be supporting one of the beat places in Alameda.< /Text>

First time here, probably wouldn't go back. Overall mediocre food for lunch buffet, with terrible tasting sushi. I gave 3 stars since it is all you can eat and you can choose your ingredients for the Mongolian grill part.</Review>

As a child I would come here to eat with my family. I have to say I love it. Even though the food are basically the same, I love the customer service. The waitresses come out and talk to us. I've found out that the owner works here as well, not just observing from the sidelines. It's great for families looking for a place to eat.<//Text>

<Text>This place pleasantly surprised us. You need to know what put on your plate, but once you figure it out the food is quite good for a buffet of this style. Specifically, egg rolls were hot, not oily and very tasty. Their macaroons are the bomb.< /Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808f8695b91a57a7:0x75d8a1bb58913e33</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Where do I even start. If I could give them 6 stars I would.  As soon as I walked in I was welcomed by the many people working there. They knew imdeietly what I wanted. The meal cost lest then $5 and it was amazing. They even went and made another batch of fried rice just for me. I sat down and began to eat and soon there was a steaming plate of fried rice in my face. I’ve never gotten this much food for $5 ever. The fried rice had chunks of ham and juicy carrots in them while the sesame chicken had a nice crunchy outside with and extremely juicy inside. My water was always being refilled which was great and I even noticed that they took the time to organized the sugar packets on the tables. They people there were extremely nice to me and I expect to be eating there from here on out. Disregard any of the 1 star comment because they are completely not true. This place will serve you and the employees put their heart and soul into their job. It feels like they never go outside because they are so focused inside. Please go here often, this place is out of this world.<//Review>

Food delicious an inexpensive for a chinese buffet.  You can also order individual items if you don't want to eat buffet.  Staff friendly.  This place is in no way fantasy, but it's absolutely good cooking and friendly.</Text>

<Text>This is the only Mongolian Barbeque place I've found that's even remotely close to the Berkeley/Oakland area, which is sad. But the food was pretty good. For the incredibly low price, it could be much worse. They have a nice selection of food in addition to the Mongolian BBQ and sushi. The Mongolian BBQ could use a bit more flavor, but all around not bad.

Also the service was GREAT. The ladies who run it were very nice and attentive. I don't think my cup of water went below halfway the whole time I was there.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Name>xbreadfox</Name>< resp>

For an open buffet that's $12 bucks I would expect a wider selection. Also, refills are a dollar each on the soda.

But they do have crab legs for dinner that my dad loved, but I on the other hand thought were too oily.<//Review>< user_name>

< review>
Came in for dinner about 6:00, assuming the food would  be fresh and hot at that time.  It was neither. I've read lots of reviews of this restaurant and it seems that it has more sentimental value than food quality. Many people comment that they had been coming for years and the place is as good as it gets. It's not! Perhaps these people should investigate the Chinese buffet at ninth and Broadway in Oakland, only a mile away. Or one on International Blvd or on Willow Pass in Concord. They are four times as large, much greater selection, includes free soft drinks and a 10% senior discount. The price is only two dollars more than they Genghis Khan, a much better value.

To be more specific, I found that their sushi to be excellent and the proper was Sasabi and pickled ginger was available.  Nothing on the rest of the buffet compared favorably. The wonton soup was mildly flavorful but the wonton skins were mushy as they had  seem to have been cooked over and over. At 6 o'clock, the beginning of the dinner hour, most of the food on the buffet was only room temperature. It advertises a" seafood buffet", yet the only fish was a single flat overcooked and very unappealing filet of fish with the skin on. The mussels and clams were flavorless. The oysters while large and in the shell were not raw, as is common on other Chinese buffets, but had a dense and strange texture. When I inquired I was told that indeed they were not fresh but had been steamed. They were not served with any sauce. Steamed oysters? They were dreadful. I was disappointed. And the shrimp served in the fried shell was shriveled and tasteless. There were no tempting vegetables at all, simply a pan of chopped bell pepper and celery with a few tiny cooked shrimp thrown in, again totally tasteless. The only 'appetizer' was egg rolls, cold and greasy.

As for condiments, I've never been to a Chinese restaurant or buffet where the condiments were not available on the individual tables. These were not and one had to dish them up in small plates and carry each to the table individually. What shocked me was a large bottle of Heinz ketchup on the condiment tray by the end of the buffet table. Ketchup in a Chinese restaurant??? I should have been forewarned when I came in and saw all the tables laid out only with knife and fork, no chopstick options. I guess people in Alameda prefer this rather bland and unpleasant preparation of food as there was not an Asian in the restaurant. They were all over in Oakland's Chinatown where the food is infinitely better.

On the plus side, I will say that the atmosphere was clean, cheery, pleasant, and the waitress was very attentive in clearing dishes and bringing fresh ice water.</review>

My husband has been wanting to try this place forever.. so I finally gave in and went. We showed up around 7:30 (They close at 9) and headed straight for the buffet - sat down and it was ICE COLD. Told our server that we were going to leave bc man, it was ice cubes. She even agreed that it was cold and understood that we were leaving. Lol! What a joke. Not a good way to run a business.< /text>

<Text>Can't beat it for the price.  I come in here for lunch. While the buffet food is not exquisite quality, when fresh it's as good as any asain buffet. What separates this place is the Mongolian bbq area. Since it's made to order it's always hot off the grill when it arrives to your table.  You get to decide what goes in and how to season it. It makes me laugh reading other reviews that state it (the Mongolian portion of service) lacks flavor.... guess those folks are not articulate in the culinary field...add more flavor (curry, ginger, garlic, satay, oyster, teriyaki, sweet n sour, soy sauce, Sriracha) if it lacks flavor! You are in control.</Text><Response>None< /Response>< pictures>

It is a complete joke i took one bite and told them their food was disgusting and horrible quality they said pay and get out! Three meats and like 5 veggies to choose from and its frozen crinkle cut veggies. Giant garbage noodles and 6 sauce choices which are all watered down and slosh mixed together. Please for everyones sake stay the f*@# away from thia place! I hated the bbq so i tried a piece of general tso chicken hoping it would salvage the trip haha i spit that out it definitely was not chicken!</Text>< resp>

Terrible? Yes. Mongolian? Maaaaybe...

This is some kind of weird chinese seafood restaurant. Might be an interesting fusion but its not going to satisfy your craving if you are in the mood for Mongolian BBQ. Quality didnt seem good anyway.<//review>

I should have listen to above comment from ali habibi... Food no good... I went and check first... Outside sigb says "$8.75 lunch special" other sign says "seafood dinner $12.75"... The owner charged me $12.75 for lunch... She said becoz i ate seafood... Oysters to be specific... But it's lunchtime i said... She started to argue... I just kept quiet but thats the last of me there...</review>

<review>Been coming here for a while now, I believe this place used to be a wing and things, than it changed to wingz empire. Honestly im not sure if its new owners or they just changed the name, but this place is still good. I love their food and their quantity, especially their buffalo fries!!! I would have honestly given this place 5 stars but for some reason everytime i order, either through the phone or online, when its time to come pick up my food for some reason its never ready and I gotta wait a little. But honestly besides that really good place. Would recommend.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPy_wa0zv2ig3syjdKhqZ87qmTg2BotKdY7NvkC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>My love and I like this specific location to get our buffalo fries. We usually get the buffalo fries with mild sauce and extra chicken and they always deliver great food and service. It is really good and I reccomend placing your order in person so you can pick up fresh and hot.< /text><Rate>5<//Rate><pictures>None< /pictures>< time>

Worst wings I ever tasted in my life. I order 4 different flavors, mild, honey bbq, lemon pepper, garlic paramesan. How do you mess up all four of those flavors? All out of the 20 wings not one of the wings were crunchy. All the Wings has that texture of being cooked for 6 hours and left out in room temperature. Do not get your wings from here. You will regret it. Also change the name to drumstick empire. I just realize only got 2 wings and 18 pieces of drumstick. What’s joke.</text>

<Review>Food is bomb. I had sweet and spicy wings (more spicy than sweet) and buffalo fries... everything was so tasty!!! Next time I will pick one or the other... it’s like I ordered two meals. Food would have been more affordable had I purchased a combo... plenty of parking during lunch time. The decor is bold and rough around the edges. I’m glad I tried this place.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6wS7HG5VB_hTjK2gA5xSvvM4hWmCx66WzcF4M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80d953f03f575d2b:0xeba98b6019fbab30<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I would like to speak to the manager of this establishment just to say that CYNTHIA NEEDS TO GET A RAISE! Whatever you’re paying her, DOUBLE IT! We got wings here last night (which were amazing) and they were clearly slammed. She was sweet and attentive, and took extra time to perfectly sauce my double order of cheesecake. My friend and I came here for late night munchies and it was pretty much the best snack ever. Shout out to the line cooks for rocking BOH with masks on. As a former chef I know how hot it gets back there. You all deserve a raise! Y’all are doing the lord’s work over there. 10/10 would recommend, and we will be back just to hang out with Cynthia. Cynthia, if you’re reading this, we’re your biggest fans!<//Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>This has to be one of my favorite buffalo fries place in San Diego and I have tried quite a few. I usually go about at least one time a week and every single time its spot on, I love the consistency and flavors they pack in their seasoning of the french fries & buffalo sauces.

I have not had one single issue with their customer service or my to-go orders when I call in.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0TGVt2GstFQAA5t7SMzEVS0qJd3qMgeqMMbm6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOY089efuz1E1hwV5ZVL34E3QSpqtXLneGWisDm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHrbhXdQdo04Ad4XhAdzMTmxYTUwqkGKjOOfsR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

No seasoning, probably don’t have a thermometer 🌡 to read oil temperature or the timing is off and the fries are just lame.
I usually go to Joe’s Wings and Fries but today was their day off so decided to give this place a try. You would think they would cook quality given that not many people are willing to eat out now days.

Is it customary when ordering 2 sauces on wings for everything to come separately?
Everyone was polite. Execution of the food order was horrible. All the wrong sauces.< /text>

Personally their flavors of hotness is not Hot, such as habenor mango flavor 👎, it's too sweet like Mexican candy. Such a bummer because that flavor else where is really good with a touch of spiciness.

I ordered from them through an app, which I reported the flavors being almost all habenor mango flavor, which upsets me and it wasn't my order 100 percent correct.

The lady on the phone said that I should report it through The app . SO pretty much it meant that it was the app  that messed up not wings empire staff . Which I don't believe because The  app didn't make The mistake, the people who made The wings Did!

I will say this,  The prices are legit though but I wish the flavors were 100 % correct .</review>

If I could rate lower than 1 I would.  Absolutely appalling service.  Terribly disgusting location. The cashier gave my order to the wrong customer and admitted to it and then proceeded to refuse to make my order WHICH I PAID FOR!  They refused to offer a refund.  The cook was belligerently rude and also refused to give us the order we paid for.

I'm literally speechless that they can get away with this.  They legitimately stole our money.
How can you admit to giving the wrong person my order and then refuse to rectify your mistake.

Trash service.  Trash location.  Please save yourself time and choose another location.

<text>The only reason they get three stars is because the cashier was very considerate and friendly. The whole place was dirty and trash everywhere, on the floor, tables. Near the trash can and on top of it. The food took about fifteen minutes to be ready, I ordered to go. 5 tenders mango habanero flavor.  A lady that came in ten minutes after me received her order within three minutes of placing it. The chicken it self was okay the sauce was not spicy as a habanero sauce should be but otherwise it was okay I would of only given it two stars had it not been for the cashier.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>The best tasting!! I've gone to a few other wings empire but none taste like this place!! Yes I do believe in some places cooking things different and tasting  different than other places called the same . Yes theyre the same brand name but they taste different!!! Not going to to lie I have had a few hiccups but nothing they don't fix ! They truly excel in pleasing the customer . Try this place out!</Review>< pictures>

Honestly I've never given a bad review, this  place deserves one. I ordered 10 wings in two different flavors. I got 10 Wings of one flavor and I took it in and ask them to fix. It took them in less two minutes to fix my order. I got them and my lemon pepper looked as if they were washed off with water. I literally poured out about 2 oz of water out of my container. Those wings were so soggy I didn't eat them. The flavor was supposed to be buffalo but it was extremely sour and smelled like pee. Didn't eat those either Plus the amount of money you have to spend here extremely unacceptable. Twenty bucks for ten wings and some fries? Who Do You Think You Are?<//review>

Wings Empire is a good wings and ribs joint.  Food is good.  Rib portions good,.  Moderate price.  Not much ambiance for dining in; but take out works.

The fries could be crisper, but that is minor; the ribs make the meal.

Lots of free parking< /text>

I always order tropical thunder Buffalo fries. This sauce is SO delicious ! I wish I knew the recipe.
When you order something to eat and you order it to eat in, you expect it to be hot like it was just made. There were times where I would order this dish to eat in, and when I got my order, it would be cold. I once even told them that it was cold and they took it back, but when I got a new order it was still cold. This was so disappointing.
I only give it two stars because their temperature in their food wasn't consistent. The Flavor is delicious but my food should be hot every time.<//text>

<review>I always order tropical thunder Buffalo fries. This sauce is SO delicious ! I wish I knew the recipe.
When you order something to eat and you order it to eat in, you expect it to be hot like it was just made. There were times where I would order this dish to eat in, and when I got my order, it would be cold. I once even told them that it was cold and they took it back, but when I got a new order it was still cold. This was so disappointing.

I am completely disappointed with the customer service skills their very unprofessional and ghetto.  I waited 20 minutes for my food just for it to come back dry, over cooked & with hair in it.  Where’s your uniforms ? Why are you guys eating at the register instead of the table if you’re on break ? Work more, talk less, and step up your hygiene chef !

On the bright side they have great parking in a not so busy location 😊<//Review>

I took a break from them because I'm on a serious diet, but WELL WORTH a cheat day here and there! Food is bomb. If you're from the south east and miss home like me, try the pulled pork fries.  Trust me.< /text>

I like the buffalo fries but they have no consistency here i paid for a large. And everytime it gets smaller and smaller and i was charged 1.45 for an extra squirt of sauce. And to top it off my last 2 visits it smelled like pure doo doo in that bih.< /Text>

The wings were very hard as if they had cooked them aleast a day ahead and just seasoned it with whichever flavors you asked for at the time of ordering.  Literally the seasoning was only on one side of the chicken. The frozen cheese sticks was microwaved so high that the cheese exploded all over the place. This place is not fit to be serving food of any kind. I expected more expecially for the prices that they charge. Needless to say, I won't be going back.</review>

Ok so today was my 3rd visit to this place , I can deal with a little bit of ghetto but damn , my first visit I ordered pulled pork fries they was super good so I come back a second time ,ordered before I came in over the phone  then caught the bus there just for them to tell me they ran out and order something different. So because I liked the food I said I'd give them a try again today , so I called and put in a order, caught the bus to there place and waited over 20 minutes for an order I called in over the phone , so I also asked for there extra special sauce on the side . Not only did I have to sis through listening to the employees argue but my food was drowned in BBQ sauce , I didn't ask for BBQ I asked for the special sauce on the side . So I get home to find this out. I call them to ask for the manager and it was the lady that was at the counter being rude, I actually can't even believe it's the manager . She told me if I bring the plate back they can fix it. No bih how bout you keep that nasty ass plate ,I may come by to drop it off on there floor then I'm never eating at this dump again<//text>

Be prepared to wait. They te me it's a half hour wait over the phone and I purposely show up 45 minutes later, wait in line 10 minutes (2people) and then they tell me it'll be another "10 to 15" minutes.... I walked out at that point. If you're a patient person, thefood ain't bad.... The prices are a little on the high side< /Text>

<Review>Staff in bathroom for 15 min, finally gets out with soaking wet hands as if there were no paper towels.
Worker asked him for his help and he talks back and complains.
Just seems like the place is very poorly managed and they're very slow took about 20 minutes to get a salad.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

My first time coming to this place was awesome. Second time not so much. I walked in and approached the counter where an employee was waiting behind the counter. She made eye contact with me abd immediately walked into the back and proceeded to do frivelous tasks. Legit 3 minutes and never looked back at me or returned to take my order. I feel blatently discriminiated against. Another employee witnessed this and stopped sweeping the store to come help me. In this entire transacation that took forever to just order, this woman still had not returned to the front. All the while laughing and cracking jokes in the back where i could still see her and she can see me. I hate pulling the race card bit i am a black woman, this employee is a latina woman. The employee that finally came to help me, was a black man. If it werent for him i may not have been served. I will not be bringing my money back to this broke down establishment ever again. Do not waste your time.</review>

The cashier was doing all she could do, but whoever was cooking was making some people wait 20 mins for their order. Others came in and we're served right away.< /review>

Nice little place. It's tucked into strip mall next to Outback steakhouse. There's designated parking for Wings Empire customers only right up front. Nice little bonus BC Outback is always packed and taking up all the parking. The service was great the lady was super patient and answered all our questions. It was also CLEAN very CLEAN huge bonus.

Onto the food... They have a pretty good menu and prices are very reasonable. They offer more then just wings. They have some massive burgers and the regular fried food appetizers. They also have wraps that look really good to. I took the whole family so we ordered a few different items. My oldest daughter got the buffalo chicken fries (they offer them in small,med,large) she opted for medium BC she said she was starving. Well they were massive for a medium and she now has lunch and dinner for tomorrow. I stole a few bites and they were great. The fries fresh and hot and perfect amount of chicken and sauce. Highly recommend you try these. The other two split the $5.99 5 piece chicken tender and 3 bread stick combo with BBQ sauce. The chicken strips were very big. I was thinking for $5.99 they would be those little chicken finger things you get at some other places. Nope they were all very large moist pieces of chicken with just enough BBQ sauce. The bread sticks were fresh and hot with a nice sprinkling of parmesan cheese. They were a huge hit at the table. Wife and I got the 15 Wing and made it a combo. Came with 5 bread sticks and drink. We chose 3 flavors. Good old fashion medium Wing sauce. It was delicious with right amount of tang and heat. Second choice was tropical thunder. It was sweet with pineapple hint and a massive heat on the back end but not over powering. Definitely had us saying "what do you mean you people" sorry for cheesy pun I had to with that name. Last and by far the favorite was mango habanero. Such a sweet flavorful mango beginning and then the habanero comes in and joins the party and then finishes it!!!! Was so addicting and oh so hot but in a good way. Highly recommend trying them if you're a fan of the heat.

The cook and lady running register checked in on us and even brought food to the table. We even asked for an item that wasn't on the menu (was on the online menu) and the chef made it for my kids and didn't even charge us!!!! The only negative was that they didn't have a bathroom. But I can overlook that BC the service, quality and portion sizes make up for it. Will be back often.< /review>

<text>NY Buffalo Wings and Ribs is no longer at this location.  It was  bought out around November 2015 and is now Empire Wings.  Food and service are much better.  Chipotle fries are delish!  Mango habanero wings are a must try!<//text><user_id>106347711904938253195<//user_id>< name>

<Text>Horrible experience at this location today I go there on a normal basis and always had good customer service and good food, I order my food over the phone and the cashier girl magdalena tells me it will be ready in 10 minutes,so I take a break from work to go pick up my food and as I'm walking into the store cashier is walking out with the store phone in her pocket so I'm waiting in the store to pay for my food so I can be on my way and 10 minutes pass and she is still no where in site so I got tired of waiting because I have to get back to work,but that is really unprofessional to leave while ur on the clock and you see a paying customer coming in, I'm considering not even going there anymore.</Text><gmap_id>0x80d953f03f575d2b:0xeba98b6019fbab30</gmap_id><Pics>None</Pics><Rate>1</Rate><date>1424472087975<//date><UserId.>112760352564049160768< /UserId.>< user_name>

<username>Adan Valdes</username><time>1494166350867</time><Rating>3< /Rating><text>This park has look nicer than years back and has attracted lots of new people to exercise. The field is made of turf with the ability to play both soccer and football. Around it there is a running track with multiple lanes. The park has bathrooms and a few benches to sit down to eat and some bleachers for players to watch the game on the side.

I have low review because there are a lot of drunks and junkies around this location since there is a addiction helping center for them right behind. You tend to see them around a lot in the bathrooms causing them to get broken frequently and become dirty, also a lot of needles and inappropriate action in front of kids and families. The park was well maintained at first by the city but slowing they are losing intereste to maintain it. Once in a while a group of young and old community folks comes to clean the park and they dig out bags of trash. What I can't believe is this is all done when there is an elementary school and a high school within a 2 block radius and they use the field for school activities. I don't think that's safe for kids to be around.< /text>< pics>

Nice Park and is really fun to play soccer and track in. Only problem is that the fences are a bit low so if you kick really far and high it may go out< /text>

Love finding unique hole in the wall places. This bagel shop is definitely a must try. The people who work there, are fast, the place is usually packed especially on the weekends (good indicator that the food is good) anyways I did the NY bagel and a everything bagel with creme cheese. I do not regret it. Really really good. Well worth the money too.< /review>

Made my entire day and I was filled with energy! I was so close to making the mistake of ordering some sugary & caffeine packed breakfast from Starbucks but Im glad I didn't. I got a Tropical Kale shake and a Chicken Cali on an everything bagel and my morning got way better! My headache is gone, I feel focused, energized and Im glad that I didn't get fake food from a fast food chain.< /Text>

Was 35 minutes late opening. Planned my route to stop by really quick. Waited outside saw them inside, they didn’t tell me anything like changed opening time or anything. Has to go somewhere else.<//review>

One peeve is for a $3 bagel with cream cheese, they could use a little more cream cheese. Like a lot more.

Lots of smoothies & sammys too. Even donuts.

Love all the ladies, everyone is so nice. The new digital menus look great!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rating>

Horrible breakfast burrito.  Just stop selling them take it off the menu completely. The tortilla was like a piece of wheat bread that was rolled out flat (crumbly). All the beacon was in one clump. On top of that we had to ask for salsa and they gave us one little saucer of it for two of theses horrible things.</text>

The employees seem disorganized, and I always have to repeat my order multiple times. The most recent time, I called in my order and when I arrived they had given my bagels to someone else. I repeated my order again, and then it took around 20 minutes to finish my order. There were three employees and I was the only person in the store! Something similar to this happens almost every time I go to this store. Overall, the food tastes amazing, but the service is terrible, especially the most recent time I was there.<//Review></record>

< review>
My third time eating here and I gotta say I love it. It's built your own bowl just like Chipotle but Asian style. They use fresh ingredients, good quality meats and veggies. Their sauces are delicious, hard to chose which one to get. My favorite protein is the steak satay. (The chicken satay is good too.)
I normally get jasmine rice , steak or chicken satay, the peanut sauce and top it off with  lots of delicious sides.
Finding parking can be challenging on the weekends but you can always park at the Sprouts parking lot. The customer service isn't the greatest but will do.

Impeccable customer service!  I was standing in line behind a special needs customer today and the worker/owner was so patient and kind with him.  Afterwards he asked for a cup of water and I guess due to covid, they no longer are able to provide them; so she gave him a free bottle of water instead!  Witnessing such kindness really made my day, way to go!</Review>

It's a Chipotle for Asian bowls - very good.

Everything is made fresh in-house and it shows.  Creative toppings and fresh herbs like mint and cilantro.  A wide variety of sauces makes for a healthy and tasty meal.

The space is modern, tastefully designed and super clean.  My one knock is the wire seats that dip quite a bit; so a little difficult to get out of.  (Neither of which is conducive for turning tables)<//review>

I went today. Waited because there was nobody there.  Ordered half rice, half noodles.  Got only noodles on both orders. It's over priced, and u don't even get what you order! The girl was wearing the mask half way, I was wearing it all the way. I don't know what she was doing back on the kitchen that she couldn't pay attention to the orders or wear the mask  the right way!? Bad service. Never going back.<//Review>

Haven't been here in a bit and now they have a new location in Downtown. They have changed everything. That's great but sadly, I may not visit anymore unless my company would like to eat lunch there because they seem to have rid of the ONE menu item I adored. I was so happy that I didn't have to eat at a fancy restaurant to have a steamed bun. There's not many places that offer the steamed buns with EXCELLENT shredded beef. It was the perfect meal. Steamed buns and a salad. "The Asian Project - BUNS and Bowls". Don't get me wrong - their other menu items and selections are excellent, too. I just adored the one different item. Other than that, delicious, healthy, quick food!<//review>

Have been frequenting this place since it opened and it is a terrific place to get a healthy meal that taste amazing and fills you up without making you feel sluggish in the middle of the day.
I recommend the Red Curry sauce with  Tamarin drizzle, it goes with everything they have! Could eat here everyday!< /Review>

The BEST chinese food spot in Burbank, CA .that I have tried. Highlights here are anything hand pulled, noodles wise, and their handmade dumplings. The sesame paste noodles (hand pulled) are incredible! Side note: I was recently short changed on an order (forgotten item), and called the next day -- no problem. I was refunded in cash immediately.

<review>I was actually expecting a lot more from this place but overall, in comparison to Asian Box, I preferred Asian Box over this place, but my partner said this was better so to that, to each their own.

It's not bad at all, just was expecting way more flavor here and it just didn't meet my expectations.

I will say this though, their mango slaw and cucumber slaw were VERY refreshing and fresh and for that I gave them a higher rating than what I originally went with the night I had it.</review>< pics>

<review>Unfortunately, this restaurant has some sanitation issues that it needs to address.  Per the ten visits I had during a six month period I found hair in my food four times.  I assume that the prep area is not properly clean or the employees need to start wearing hairnets.  The food is great, but I can no longer visit this restaurant out of fear of what else I may find in my food.< /review><rating>1< /rating>< Gmap_id>

I was surprised when I came here. I expected a basic tasting Asian cuisine bowl, but the flavors did really impress me. I've had 3 different bowls and every time it's been consistently great tasting. It's definitely a great quick tasting food choice.</Review>

Surprisingly good rice bowls with a Chipotle feel to how you do your toppings.  If its slow,they may even let you sample things to help make your decision.the red curry, while not spicy enough,does have a pleasant kick</Review>

The beef they serve with the bowls is very good. A little on the pricey side but again food is very good. I like to get half rice, half noodles with beef,peanut sauce all the way with the veggies.< /review>< rate>

The Curry is by far the best sauce. Both the Steak and the Chicken are great protein options. Yum.

I love the simplicity of the concept of this place. It is basically a rice/noodle bowl with your choice of sauce, protein and toppings. The Red Curry sauce is delicious. It is a cheap eat which is healthy and filling.</Text>

<text>I really enjoyed my buns and bowls here. It was so easy to make my own bowl and I love the unlimited topping choices. Mangos, and Radish and Veg OH MY! Those are a few of my favorite things!!!! but they have so much more and the sauces I have to say the red spicy creamy red curry is my favorite it taste great on noodles with chicken I could drink that sauce if they'd let me and for the steamed buns you have to go braised beef all the way with the other meats the buns feel a bit dry.Still confused on what to order Mix your meat,mix your sauces get em all It's YOUR bowl MADE YOUR WAY and ieverything is so fresh all made in house. I'm so Glad this place is here in Burbank. I now have food options near home.<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c29543ef75b633:0x9e18b969a5eed19e</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Adding in the red curry you would think they would have pad thai noodles as well but no.  Then the steam buns...but no pork??  I think they have thier concepts wrong.  But I'll go back.</text>< pics>

<text>This is a good place to come for a quick and healthy meal. We had a noodle bowl with chix satay (noodles were a tad soggy) and 3 buns with chix, 5 spice beef and meatball includes a side salad. You choose your base, protein, toppings and sauces all veggie toppings were really fresh and full of flavor. Friendly employees and clean. A little pricey but better for you than a greasy burger and fries! Busy parking lot can get congested due to Starbucks drive-thru.<//text></record>

I wish I had asked for twice as much curry. The food here was a little bland. I'm still chasing my Shop house alternative and this wasn't it.

My recommendation to the establishment would be to add some cooked veggies to the toppings.</Text>

I have only positive things to say about Golden 1's mobile banking representatives and they offer excellent interest rates as far as this particular branch goes, never again. It was very unprofessional, my husband and I made an appointment with someone there who went on lunch? When they had an appointment? and the person who covered them gave us a phone number and though they were kind when they said it told us to call and ask someone over the phone to do everything we scheduled an appointment for in the first place, took over 2 hours! There is also a line to get in with no sign acknowledging what to do should you have an appointment, thankfully we asked but we overheard someone else get written off as a no show because they waited in line.< /Text>

<gmap_id>0x8090514e30cc62fd:0xe14dcafd43afbaae< /gmap_id><Review>Always understaffed. 10am, 2 tellers and 3 guest service account people. Always like this. Terrible. As far as the employees? Excellent. That why 2 stars. The ATM is not very safe and there are no -"No loitering / Trespassing" signs posted.

Today 08/10/2020
I have been waiting outside the business for about 30m, by the ATM machines...I have been asked to turn away like 10 times, some nice, some less so.

There isnlimited shade here so other are forced to line up in front of other businesses.

Golden One looks good on paper, their experience in person? You tell me...If zero stars could be a thing.

Understaffed during the pandemic? Even before, this location was understaffed. Laughable PR response...thanks for trying Golden 1.<//Review>< Date>

I hear a lot of people complaining, but we don’t know how they run there business, maybe the method they use makes them money. Example could be less tellers also less atms or less buildings. All those things would only add money loss instead of gain. I’m happy with them and learn from people so maybe I can run a successful business too. God bless all and contentment is great gain!<//review>

I give them 4.5 stars because they are wonderful overtime I interact with them.  Everyone is professional and polite to me.  I never wait long and I just love the ATM deposit functions.

I have banked with Credit Unions for 30 years, I love them, they are fantastic banks, since you know exactly what is going on with your money.  That to me is the essential function of what a CU does.

Parking is the only issue, I don't feel very safe after dark at the ATM.

A+ guys, Thanks a fan< /Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Sadly I opened an account  with my young daughter to help build her credit .She was out of the country for a year and we thought this a great way to make sure she had funds, as well .She returned home in July and walked into the credit union to pay off the account. A few months later I started seeing my credit score drop due to unpaid statement. I had my daughter go back and again she was given the pay off amount. For some reason they had a balance of a few dollars. So she paid that off in October. I just saw ANOTHER drop in my credit score and accused my daughter of not taking care of things .She WENT BACK IN in February and paid ANOTHER BALANCE. KEEP IN MIND WE HAVE NOT CHARGED ANYTHING SINCE THE FIRST PAY OFF IN JULY!! So a little over a week later I'm here to make sure the account is closed and...... they have ANOTHER FEE!!!! They are saying interest charges accrued after paying the balance each time. Now they've added late fees after the balance was paid .They said we would have to close out and call main office in order to have no more charges.  THIS IS like Stealing!!!!  Sad thing is we have an account here for a car loan and haven't had issues. What a mess!<//Text>< pics>

When it breaks,(as it often does), you are forced to pay Golden1 $2 to use someone else's ATM.  GOLDEN 1'S phone service system is also dismal.  Half of the staff at the Modesto branch do not belong there including the manager.  I would recommend any credit union over Golden 1.

Account Rep didn't seem fully interested in our needs.  He didn't process our check request (found this out after waiting two weeks)   He surely didn't understand their process for wire transfers sending me to a teller line and then I was redirected to another Account Rep. who did take care of us.</text>

<text>I had banked with Golden 1 for 20 years in Turlock, great service, 2 ATMs.  When I moved to Modesto I started to hate going to the Modesto branch. NEVER enough tellers. There can be 15 people in line, 2 tellers and 3 people sitting in offices. The manager is totally useless! We have changed banks. One account left and it will be closed out by the end of the week.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

The lines are always ridiculously long no matter what time of day you go in. It's not just the line inside it is also the line to the ATM only 1 machine outside crazy. They need to think about the customer I mean they did just invest so much into the suckie Sacramento kings by building and using there name on the colosium.  How about you take care of the customers that trust your institute with our money so we want to continue to want to Bank with you:}< /text>

<Review>This Golden 1 is the worst one Ive been to. Its the only one in town and for them to have this knowledge,  they are always short staffed, the lines always take forever with the tellers. The bankers are slow. I waited an hour to open up a second account for my daughter to be told that my letter from social security was in the wrong format. They gave me completely different information from the branch i visited in turlock the day before. The ATM is always broken...forcing you to go outside of the branch to an atm where your charged Fees. They really need to do a better job. I. Seriously considering leaving golden 1 and its mainly because of this branch. I literally have to expect to be in the bank 30-hour if i need to go to this branch which is ridiculous.  Please hire more people..get it together. A thousand smile's wont make up for wasted time.< /Review><gmap_id>0x8090514e30cc62fd:0xe14dcafd43afbaae< /gmap_id><Rate>1< /Rate>< username>

I have tried several Barbers and Barber Shops in town with mixed results.

Then one day I decided to try a local Barber Shop and by chance I happened to get Gus.  That was two years ago.  Gus has done an outstanding job on my hair since then.   The cuts are very precise and consistent and he really has an eye for getting everything just perfect.  Plus he is just a nice guy - very easy to talk to,  which makes the whole experience more enjoyable.

In  October 2016 I came into the shop with a request for a  "Monk" style haircut for Halloween.
I pulled out my phone and showed him what I wanted.  He said are you sure?  And I said yes!  He did an outstanding job and approached the project with care to make sure it turned out just right.  BTW I did win first place in the costume contest.  Then in 2017  I came back and requested a Punk Rocker cut and Gus delivered again!!   Glad to see Gus has his own shop now!< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>If you've never had a straight razor shave by Guss you are missing out. My face feels like I'm 16 again. Only took him about 30 minutes to take off 10 years. If you want your man's face to be smoother than a baby's bottom then send them to Guss. Will definitely be a returning customer for more shaves and haircuts. The young lady began cutting my hair as soon as I walked in and was engaging with good conversation. Overall a great atmosphere, staff and good pricing. 5 gold stars.< /text></record>

I highly recommend 5 Stars Barber Shop. Gus provided the BEST haircut I’ve had in at least two decades. I regret using those chain haircut shops with mediocre customer service and inconsistent cuts. Gus and 5 Stars Barber Shop are simply impressive. Aside from the best haircut I’ve had in a very long time, Gus and the others were very friendly, the environment was very clean (and they abided by the current CDC’s COVID recommendations), the chair was comfortable, and more. While there, I also treated myself to a beard trim. Gus is an expert! I first tried 5 Stars Barber Shop after taking my son there. I was so impressed with my son’s haircut that I needed to try it. I’m a loyal customer from here on out. Thanks, Gus! Again, I highly recommend 5 Stars Barber Shop.< /text>

Everyone at 5-Stars is very friendly, and they do a great job. My sons and I have been getting our hair cut from Gus for years now - we don't go anywhere else. The shop itself is very clean and spacious; plenty of room to hangout and relax if there's a wait. Highly recommend this place.<//review>

Gus has been incredibly accommodating to me and my kiddos. He goes out of his way to make my kids feel at ease, and let’s not forget the incredible haircuts 💇‍♂️ After searching high and low in Bakersfield for a fresh cut, I finally found Gus.

For the service and quality, his prices are more than fair.

His establishment offers various amenities.</Text>

Terrible experience, I do not recommend going to this barbershop! Never had a haircut so poorly done on my hair. The ladies working there clearly do not know how to cut hair. The barber only spent a few minutes cutting my hair, which I have no clue why she was in a hurry when the place was empty. Also, the barber seemed to not be able to hear me when I’m right in front of her. $20 for a haircut should be for a quality job, not a quick job. I had to go home to fix my hair to avoid the barber making my hair worse. I would stay clear from this barber. The male barber seems to be a favorite so I wish I chose him to do my hair.< /Text>

<Text>I had been looking for a good barber ever since we moved to Bakersfield but, saying that I was extremely disappointed after visiting several chain shops is an understatement. Luckily, I found Gus when I decided to try a local shop and have been going to him ever since. He does an excellent job every time and goes out of his way to serve his customers. He would rather work beyond closing time than send anyone away. He is always friendly and courteous. If you want a barber for life, try 5 Stars.< /Text>< user_id>

Took my 9 year old son in for a hair cut and Guss did a great job. Went in a week later for a hair cut for myself and needless to say I have a new barber! Very clean, nice shop. Gus does a great job and very detail oriented. Had him trim and straight razor my beard and it turned out excellent!</review>

Guss is amazing and truly loves his job and making sure his clients leave looking their best. The staff and everyone that works there is incredibly welcoming. They definitely live up to their name and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a new shop to get an awesome cut and shave.

Nice shop Guss!<//Review>

I love my dads work. He is the best barber in the world and I'm not just saying that because im his daughter. I am saying this because he is a very good barber and show him lots of support. Everytime I come to visit my dad at work, I always have to hear "Gus is the best barber." In my head I am thinking of how much everyone loves my dads hair cuts. His shop is called "5 Stas Barber". So why not rate it 5 Stars. If you are looking for a fresh hair cut come my dads shop. "5 Stars Barber".🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟<//Text>

Guss the owner of 5 star barber shop is more than a barber he's an artist, a perfectionist. I can honestly say best haircut/beard trim i've ever gotten.< /text>

<text>I called Guss ahead of time and he was very friendly over the phone, was happy to accommodate me as a walk-in on Memorial Day. This was my first time at 5 Stars Barber with Guss. I got a beard trim and hair cut, which included a straight razor. The hair cut and blend into the beard came out looking great and exceeded my (naturally high) expectations. Guss does great work and cares about quality, it shows in craft. I am grateful to have met Guss. It is no surprise that he has another happy and loyal customer.<//text>< pictures>

Ok place to stay. But amenities are poor. Gym and clubhouse is very small.  Two children parks were there but now only 1 left. Earlier the alliance managed it but now it's FPI. Lot of renovation being done - swimming pool tiles, water fountain, lots of plants, which is a good thing. I love that there are lots of trees, ample parking area, and a good place to stroll or jog. The Indian community is huge and lots of children of different ages play. It's fun to watch them. But yes recently safety has been a major concern. There was theft in one the apartments last month and since then we are more alert about our surrounding.i just hope the situation gets better.< /text>

< Review>
I lived in this Community for a year and all was ok including maintenance but when my apartment was up for renewal the management did not  even bother to send a notice with the renewal details. When I went to leasing office they said because of Covid situation they are not sending details for renewal and will put on month on month once the lease is over.
I wanted to connect with the property manager Ann but was not let to connect with her as she was very busy and was asked to communicate over mail. I dropped a mail for the renewal details and called the office regularly and sent reminders but only got a response from Ann after a week which said she can offer the new price for a 6 month lease only which I denied and asked for a 12 months lease. Again no reply for next 5 days and then when I found a new apartment which was much cheaper and better I put up a notice to vacate the place and within an hour I got a reply stating that the can offer me the lease for a year with the renewed rate. If they would have offered me earlier then mostly I would not have changed but anyways got a better apartment at a much cheaper rate.
And lastly forget your security deposit of $800 as Willowbend as they will put some junk changes and deduct your whole amount. My monthly utility in the 12 months that I had stayed had come a maximum of $120 a month but when I vacated the apartment it seems for a month and 10 days the amount is $308 which I am not sure how it was calculated. Also they put a cleaning charge, paint, carpet and every possible change when I had maintained the apartment well and did a full cleaning before leaving the apartment.
So I would suggest better stay away from this apartment and you won't get response from the management nor will you get back your security money of $800. Only good thing is there maintenance staff as they work promptly and resolve any service request raised with in 24 hours which is highly appreciable.</Review>

I’ve lived here for the past 4 years and let me tell you the new Management is amazing and I love all the new upgrades!! I’m now in my second apartment here as I transferred to a renovated unit. Ann has been so helpful and very responsive to all of my request. Anytime I place a work order in, it’s completed within 24hrs. One of my favorite parts of the community is all of the lush landscaping and beautiful trees! I love that we are close to grocery stores and the Cal Train.< /text>

<rate>3</rate><Resp>None</Resp><text>Went to look at the place, although a little concerned after reading the other reviews. Some reviews were legit.

Pros-Nice property, peaceful and beautiful Redwood trees. Price was economical as well.
Cons-Apt smelled like an Indian restaurant.  Not managments fault tho, but that smell doesn't go.  Cars do get towed but if you want another spot its $30 a month. Which isn't fair as there is no off site parking,  but at least you have that option, so ppl that visit dont get their cars towed. Cabinets are pathetic!
And property is dated!

However, I asked to meet Ann, who is nothing like I expected, esp after reading the reviews.  She was Helpful, Informative , Understanding and answered all my concerns.  Only if they fixed the issues.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><time>1606199408774< /time>< user_id>

They have hundreds of empty parking spots yet they choose to tow away vehicles. Permit parking signs are either faded or nonexistent. They probably think it’s a good way to fleece people with this unreasonable and senseless  policy. Their choice to enforce such policy will tell you how petty they can be with other things so be careful and try to stay away.<//review>

They will take deposit of 250$ for processing application.After that they will not approve the application saying they were unable to verify some 3 year old address as leasing office was shut because of corona...then they will ask for one month security deposit to approve application...they are frauds eager to loot the application fee money.Even after having credit score of 780+ and verification of two year address these guys were trying to extort one month security deposit.I told I cannot pay that much amount and these guys did not return my application fee till now.Both the leasing office employees are frauds..beware of them<//Text>

<Review>I went there to meet one of my friends. I parked my car where the sign of permit parking was faded so it was not even visible until or unless someone tells you that it’s a permit parking. I parked my car there because I didn’t know it was a permit parking. I went for 2 hrs and my car was towed around 1 o’clock at night by some company called Rebello. I paid like $500 to get my car. The society must put a proper sign or paint it so that no one can face such kind of problem in future.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808fb6056464f975:0xd5a7def3bf37a787<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I didn't live there long but during my short time of stay, I enjoyed my time. Property and apartment are very clean. Laundry is very close to the apartment (literally 1–2 mins walk). The staff and management, particularly Ann James are very helpful and always willing to help. They reply to Emails quickly and are available during their office hours. I highly recommend this place.</Review>

Good place to raise kids as there are lots of open spaces . Safe for kids to play . New renovations/restorations work is ongoing, added Barbeque pits/sitting benches.
Management is also helpful and good maintenance staff. Timely maintenance support always there.< /text>

We really enjoy our home at Willowbend. The maintenance and office staff are easy to talk to. I’ve personally spoke to the manager several times and she really knows what she’s doing. Sure, they’re busy at times and can’t get to all problems/concerns immediately. It’s a big complex! But from the changes I see happening around the complex, I can tell this team cares about our homes appearance. Get to know your management team Willowbend community! It’s sad to see they don’t have better reviews because this is really a great staff.</text>

They got me with an extra month of rent because the temp guy did not know what he was doing. I would say the maintenance people are the only good people to talk too. Expect only 5 days to pay off your final bill and it will be coming from a collection agency. The facilities are also a joke. Worst experience ever.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Worst people ever. I hope the rental office folks get what they deserve as a person. They are incredibly insensitive to renters, are so rude and think they can get away with anything in this market. Forget being professional, they lack the most basic human courtesy. Can you imagine that there is only one way to pay the rent with them - cashiers check. And why? Because they cannot fix their portal. She is threatening on the phone to the point where you feel helpless. Almost being racist if you are not white!

Horrible service from RUBY (MANAGER)

My experience of living here was totally horrible.
When my car got towed, they told me that I should have applied for a permit for parking.
However, this is not written in the contract. I talked to manager RUBY, and i had a "funny" conversation with her.

RUBY: Parking space is permit only, you should have known you need to apply for a permit before you park the car. YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT. IT IS THE SAME THING IN EVERY HOTEL.

ME:  I don't think it's a good example. This has nothing to do with hotels! If you want to say so, I would say, we got friends who live in Sunnyvale and their community doesn't ask them to apply for a parking permit. Therefore, if you never asked us to apply for parking permit, I'm sorry, I would never know!!!!!!!!!

RUBY: it's because each company has their way to run their business.

ME: OK, so your "hotel example" doesn't make any senses though. Tell me, if you never told me I should apply for a parking permit and it even doesn't indicate in the contract, how am I supposed to know that?

RUBY: We don't need to put the permit fee in the contract, We don't need to do that!

THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ON THE LEASING AGREEMENT, IT EVEN INDICATED AN ADDITIONAL KEY IS 5 DOLLARS.
BUT THERE IS NO PARKING PERMIT FEE!!!!!!!!!!!

To be honest, I would never rent any apartment from this company, their management and service is horrible and their attitude is kind of rude,
Most importantly, they will charge you extra money which is not written in the contract and they don't even inform you before doing so. Unbelievable!!!</Text>< date>

I have been living here for 3 years. My experience is a little different compared to the below reviews. The block I stay in has had no bed bug issues. I have also had my(rental) car towed once , but that was because I did have the parking permit. All scheduled maintenance was done on time without any delay.
My fav thing about these  kind of apartments is I can park my car ,walk 20 feet and be home.
I have had no issues with the management , they have been friendly and have always responded promptly. Yes sometimes their phone gets busy but other than that my experience has been gr8.< /Text>

First, they had our car towed, which made us have to pay a huge fine about 400 dollars and charged us with an additional monthly fee. however, this term (or monthly fee) is not INDICATED IN THE CONTRACT. but the most unbelievable thing is that manager RUBY told us, you guys should know by yourself and it's common sense since parking spaces belong to the property owner, you should know applying for the parking permit is necessary. PLZ, consider twice before you ever trying to move in here.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fb6056464f975:0xd5a7def3bf37a787<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I lived here for around 8 months.

Pros:
1. Apartment complex has plenty of open space and trees.
2. No narrow corridors.
3. Rent was resonable.

Cons:
1. Very old apartment, nothing is new.
2. Kitchen is so bad, no granite counter tops, old coil based kitchen stove tops, sink is very small.
3. Washer and Dryers are small. If you want to dry the clothes, you need to do the process twice.
4. Deposit is done, never expect any refunds. Even though we kept our apartment walls clean, they charged us for re-touching/painting.</text>< pictures>

Get ready to have your/your visitor's car towed at any instant.
They have a tie-up with Morris and Sons Towing and do a great job in illegally towing your car. Management is pathetic.<//Text>

<time>1498162774410</time><review>My experience here has been absolutely horrific. I've been living here as part of corporate housing, and I wouldn't wish this experience on my own worst enemy. Appliances are constantly going out, money was being taken out of my account up to two weeks after they indicated it would be and then to top it all off, I was being overcharged so they had to give me a credit.

My most recent encounter with the staff has taken the cake, though. My rental car was towed from a visitor's park and I had to pay to get the car back. I went to the office:

Employee: You should have gotten a parking pass.
Me: How could I if your office was closed?
Employee: You should have came and got one earlier before we closed.
Me: How can I get a pass without having rented the car? I wouldn't have had the car's license plate, make or model.
Employee: I see what you're saying, that's kinda messed up. I'm sure they would've just given you a blank pass.
Me: So you give out blank passes? How was I supposed to know that? Where is it posted?
Employee: It's just a messed up situation, sorry.

Ridiculous. So basically the moral of the story is I can't have company come over when the office is closed because I risk having their car towed. UNACCEPTABLE.

Do yourself a favor, look elsewhere. I pay too much money to be this inconvenienced.< /review><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Text>If you are thinking of moving here even after reading the reviews, you need to go to a shrink and get your head checked.!!
Why??-
1) your desposit will not be returned.
2) If you call Mari Hwang (the namanger), She will hang up on you.
3) Your car will not have a CD player and the rear window.
4) you won't be able to sleep at night because of the noise.< /Text><UserId.>114101025614168567645< /UserId.>< rating>

Worst place ever.. they put fake smile when you are signing papers and once that's done then they show you their real side.. special call-out to "Julian" worst person we have ever met.. I would never recommend these apartments to anyone..<//text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) When I left this place after living there 1 year, they charged me $2000 for cleaning and damages.
Not recommended, not recommended at all! When you move away, they will charge you various expenses, such as repainting the washstand and kitchen, and then the cost is huge. Unreasonable.
The paper thin wall is not noise isolation at all, you can hear clearly what your neighbors talking about.
It's not soundproof. If you run into a noisy neighbor, there is really no way...

When I left this place after living there 1 year, they charged me $2000 for cleaning and damages.
不推荐，完全不推荐！搬离时候他们会charge你各种费用，譬如洗脸台和厨房都要重新粉刷，然后费用巨高。不可理喻。

非常不隔音，如果碰到吵闹的邻居那真的是没办法……</Text>< pictures>

<Review>I got very lucky , I kept calling different insurance companies, finally landed on freeway insurance, and had Vanessa helping me. She was very understanding, kind and went Above and Beyond to help me out with the rate and down payment. Instead of giving no’s and quick shut down responses, she made sure she could get me the best rate possible. The world needs more Vanessa’s in this world!! :)<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Freeway insurance has some quality employees that made me feel welcome and advise me with the best options and give me the lowest rate possible. Customer service is definitely something I value and would definitely recommend this establishment to anyone seeking insurance. Thank you freeway insurance for a wonderful experience, keep up the good work.<//review>

<Text>Had a bad experience here. I got a policy and had to pay a down payment of 400$. About three months later my payment went from 80.57$ to 241$  because I've only had my license for two years they said and the agent that helped me had put that I had like 13 years of experience. Best they could do is get me a new policy but had to pay the down payment again.< /Text>< Rate>

Freeway insurance in Panorama City is the one to go to. The staff working there are an absolute delight. I first went there about 2 years ago and was completely taken care of by LuLu. I was given a lot of options, and we were able to land on a quote that I was happy with. I recently re-upped on insurance with LuLu again and she did not fail to amaze with her patience and over the top customer service. I feel right at home when dealing with Freeway, and I’m sure it is the same for every guest. Thank you so much LuLu and the staff over in Panorama City!

Freeway insurance is definitely a place I would highly recommend for anyone I've had really bad experience with other insurances .  But juan was able to work with different types of coverages and choose one that was able to match my budget . Victor was one of the best employees as well Freeway insurance has great  customer service . I'm honestly looking forward for my next visit  .< /Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) They only attend to you well when you are looking for insurance after you already have it. Wow, they don't want to help you at all. They see that they don't like to work .... I went to fill the paper for the automatic payments until I left them a check with a month of wait, payday arrived and I just wasted time they didn't do the process and they still charged me an extra $ 10 for making the payment, the mistake was theirs for not doing their job ... I don't recommend this freeway at all , is not safe

(Original)
Sólo te atienden bien cuando se busca aseguranza luego que ya la tienes wow pésimo lugar no quieren ayudarte para nada se ve que no les gusta trabajar....fui a llenar el papel para los pagos automáticos hasta les deje un cheche con un mes de espera, me llego el día de pago y solo fui a perder tiempo no hicieron el proceso y todavía haci me cobran 10$ extra por hacer el pago, el error fue de ellos por no hacer su trabajo...no recomiendo este freeway para nada, no es seguro< /review></record>

The owner of this outstanding thrift store, Mark Converse, is a class act
as are the other members of his family that work at the store.
All the team members have been friendly, helpful and courteous when I have visited the store.
They have some of the most interesting and diversified merchandise anywhere
that comes mostly from storage locker auctions.
The store is well organized and the products are categorized.
in various sections.
It is one of my favorites.<//Text>

<Text>Kinda messy, but there's usually always something interesting or new to find. The prices tend to be iffy since it seems they do a basic price match to whatever you can find online, not taking into account missing pieces, or the wear on the items being sold. As an example, I found an instrument priced just a few dollars less than what you can find online for a brand new one directly from the manufacturer. I recommend this place, but would encourage anyone to double check prices online before you buy.< /Text>< pics>

I am always stopping by to see any new arrivals here. I do find what I'm looking for usually, if not more. The prices are reasonable, and the staff is very friendly. And they also offer 10% military discount which is a plus..</Text>

Due to being next to a fantastic thrift store I didn't think they would get a good crowd. This place has better quality things than their neighbors (no pun intended given their name). Things are at times still in its box or have tags on them. Its also more vintage. They have a tools section like hammers and garage stuff and furniture that is locked up in the next business room over. Be ready to pay more though.<//Review>

Hard to find items here. Also good prices. I got a pair of nice, warm, high quality ski gloves in perfect condition for $12.00. At the army surplus the same gloves were $35.00! I've heard the store is closing though. It will be missed.< /Text>

Thrift store with some good prices and some overpriced, most items are procured by storage unit default, so you may find your own items for sale if your lucky.</text>

Love the Mojave! Open spacious and no one around. Have primitive camped here several times and it’s a great place to wander among the Joshua trees and watch the wildlife without the crowds that you find in a lot of other places.< /review>

Thirsty for revenge, I go out to Vegas and kill him. After this I go to his room and find his robot called ‘yes man’. He would help me take revenge on the Mojave desert and we could both gain supreme control so I helped him. Long story short, I killed the president of Vegas, we made Julius Caesar leave the desert somehow??? And Yes Man threw the leader of our greatest enemy, the NCR over the Hoover dam.

<Rate>5<//Rate><pics>None</pics><time>1611682387820<//time><review>Home of the lowest, hottest point in North America, giant yuccas, and moving stones.

North America’s smallest, driest desert is sandwiched between the cold Great Basin Desert to the north  and the hot Sonoran Desert to the south. Due to its proximity to two contrasting desert areas, experts rarely agree on the Mojave’s boundaries, size, or type.

Levels of extremes.
Badwater Basin in the Mojave’s Death Valley lies 282 ft (86 m) below sea level—the continent’s lowest point— yet Telescope Peak in the Panamint Range soars  11,043 ft (3,366 m) above it. North America’s highest  air temperature of 134°F (57°C) was recorded here, at Furnace Creek in 1913, yet winter temperatures regularly drop below freezing. Winds above 50 mph (80 kph) often buffet the Mojave’s western edge but are rare in the east. In the north, low-growing scrubland resembles the Great Basin Desert, but to the south, creosote bush takes hold.
The Joshua tree, the largest North American yucca, is a symbol of the Mojave and is often used by ecologists as an indicator of the desert’s southern boundary. Death Valley is also home to “sailing stones”—boulders that appear to move unaided (see panel, left).< /review>< gmap_id>

Absolutely amazing. Though it may not be on you list, maybe it should be. The landscape throughout is breathtaking and definitely worth a visit at least once.</Review>

To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running, came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of 24
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and 19 more
One and 19 more
Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red
Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead
20 men had tried to take him, 20 men had made a slip
21 would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet
It was 20 past 11 when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows, everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death
There was 40 feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on living but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip</Text>

< Review>
Sometimes when I am not in rush and I go to the Joshua Tree National Park from Las Vegas I choose the route across the Mojave Desert. This route is a bit abandoned but no worry  it just take 15-20 minutes to meet another car who uses this route too. You will be able to take photos of animals, Joshua Trees, sand dunes, and granite rocks as well.< /Review>

Plus, when I got this assignment, I thought there'd be more gambling. And on top of it all, we won't go quietly, and believe me, the Legion can count on that. Anyways, during my stay, I decided to check around this cool town called Novac. There, a New California Republic Trooper asked me to help fix up the old Helios One Power Plant. They asked me if I knew a scientist. I told them they're looking at one. They asked me if I had a degree in theoretical physics. I said I have have a theoretical degree in physics.

Let me tell you, if you want to keep your sanity and your legs DON'T GO. My kids enjoyed the plentiful cactus and started collecting the prickly pears atop. When night fell we set up a fire and relaxed after the long drive. The kids were running around and happily screaming, as children do, when what we thought was a injured man started to approach us. We quieted and attempted to communicate, its rebuttal was akin to a geiger counter and its movements became sporadic. It appeared to have half a human torso in its grasp, but immediately abandoned it to pursue us.  We booked it to the RV and made off. We planned to stay in the area for a fortnight, but we decided to head home for obvious reasons. Stay out of the desert if you enjoy safety.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

It’s so hot and awesome, it gives Fallout: New Vegas vibes. Hell, I got attacked by a Deathclaw and a Giant Radscorpian, but I managed to kill them both for their poison glands and Deathclaw eggs and sell them on eBay!👌🏻<//review>

I've been living here since 1992. The extreme hot weather takes some getting used to, but I wouldn't live anywhere else. Plenty of things to do, lots of wildlife if you are patient, I can understand why it's not for everyone.< /text>

<review>One of the best places we have been.
Nice hikes.
Good campground seemed a bit deserted.
Lots of wildlife, rabbits especialy.
Stars are amazing here like you can touch the sky almost.
Paid 15$ normally is 13$ but had no change so get right amount if you want to pay exact amount<//review></record>

Great Desert. Very good place for drying stuff. I also so like Desserts., Apple crumble is a favourite. Especially with some clotted cream.< /Text>

<Text>A portion of My family and I were on our way to Las Vegas Nevada when we decided to Stop off at the Mojave desert for a unique experience, you always see it on TV, but until you actually go there and experience it in person, TV and Books just doesn't do it justice. It's very Hot, and beautiful, but also very dangerous, with variety of different snakes, spiders, scorpions, prickly trees and cactus plants that have very long sharp thorns. It is very dry In the Desert with little to no shade.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<text>Good times all around, lived there for a few years, even found a job as a mailman. But, when someone stole my package and shot me in the head things got rough, if it weren't for a local doc I would've died. Long story short, wandered the desert, met some Roman Legionaries, and Elvis was there.</text>< pictures>

<Text>Was pretty awesome. Got attacked by a few Legionary patrols, geckos, and deathclaws. Also some weird ex con people with dynamite. For some reason whenever I turn on my radio “Johnny Guitar” plays almost on a loop. Overall not bad, i joined this militia called the NCR (New California Republic) and man, patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.</Text><UserId.>104773190110904304699<//UserId.><Pics>None</Pics><GmapID>0x80cf61476bd798cf:0xca4c53e5430da34<//GmapID>< resp>

I've been playing in the Mojave desert for over 20 years. It is a great place to take your offroad toys and explore from Mojave to CA city or head up the mtn range and go all the way back to the cabin. The ride from Jawbone to the cabin is 1 of my favorite family desert memories.<//text>

<text>The Mojave Desert is bordered by the Great Basin Desert to its north[5] and the Sonoran Desert to its south and east.[5] Topographical boundaries include the Tehachapi Mountains and the Sierra Pelona Ridge to the west, the Sierra Nevada and the Inyo Mountains to the northwest, and the San Gabriel Mountains and San Bernardino Mountains to the south. The mountain boundaries are distinct because they are outlined by the two largest faults in California – the San Andreas and Garlock faults. The Mojave Desert displays typical basin and range topography. Higher elevations above 2,000 ft (610 m) in the Mojave are commonly referred to as the High Desert; however, Death Valley is the lowest elevation in North America at 280 ft (85 m) below sea level and is one of the Mojave Desert's harshest climates and best known places. Large parts of the Mojave Desert are often referred to as the "high desert", in contrast to the "low desert", the Sonoran Desert to the south. Most of the Mojave Desert is above 2,000 ft (610 m), with only Death Valley and the Colorado River basin in the east (including the neighboring Las Vegas Valley) being lower. The Mojave Desert, however, is generally lower than the even higher Great Basin Desert to the north. The Mojave Desert occupies less than 50,000 sq mi (130,000 km2), making it the smallest of the North American deserts.[5]<//text><pics>None</pics></record>

Very hard to draw on a map. Thought it would be cool to take my 3 year old child turned out I lost him. Found him 2 days later in a scorpion den. Although he got lost, it made way for me and my husband to make agressive love nonstop, though the heat really dampened the mood.(get it. Dampened cause like sweat) SAD! (also there are not enough NOT LAME rocks)</review>

Came out here in hopes of summoning Tiamet, my beautiful dragon queen, in privacy. Unfortunately the ritual failed, and because there were no trees, many passerbys witnessed my heinous act. To summarize, please add more trees. For privacy.<//Text>

Meh.  It's better than the Gobi, but it's no Sahara.

They say that if you get lost out here, you end up talking to the sand and eating cactus, or vice versa.  But sunrise over the desert is to die for, so it all evens out.

Look out for millipedes, scorpions, and rattlesnakes.  Especially look out for dehydration, and don't pet the yucca.</Text>

One of the world's natural wonders and a thrill regardless of weather. Recommend a car air conditioning. A vast abstract of shadow and rock formations. Joshua trees, scrub green bush, and sunsets to die for. An ancient phenomenon. Bring the camera.</text>

The aliens made me drink an agave smoothie after which my pants got tighter and the Taylor Dane music started streaming. She was never very good, I decided. The took me aboard their ship, which was hot and crowded with the Greys working at television monitors, each screen showing another iconic world capital in a state of collapse and disarray. The creatures seemed to take great pleasure in the pain they.  were are causing and their thin mouths froze into a grim rictus, some trailing cords of spittle into their consoles, causing infrequent sputtering and the odor of burned cordite. Ew. Two stars.<//Text>

The Mrs. & were in the midst of this desert wilderness in June 2017 and we would have enjoyed seeing a lot more of it - although we did visit the Kelso Depot Visitor Center - but given that we were already hell-bent on getting in as many last-minute stops that we had already planned for on the way back to LA from Laughlin NV as our schedule would allow, we could not. It’s a desolate but achingly beautiful place and if I ever get the chance to go back I certainly will... but other bucket list destinations take priority!< /text>

<text>Was stationed at camp Irwin California near Barstow. Got brutal sunburn. Saw many sidewinder rattlesnakes and jack rabbits. Rained one day to the point of nearly flood stage and two hours later was dry. Once went into death valley. Army paid my way so I can honestly say i probably would not have visited there otherwise but if an opportunity arises I would recommend an exploratory visit.<//text>< pics>

< Review>
The Mojave Desert (/moʊˈhɑːvi, mə-/ mo-HAH-vee)[2][3][4] is an arid rain-shadow desert and the driest desert in North America.[5] It is in the southwestern United States, primarily within southeastern California and southern Nevada, and it occupies 47,877 sq mi (124,000 km2). Very small areas also extend into Utah and Arizona.[6] Its boundaries are generally noted by the presence of Joshua trees, which are native only to the Mojave Desert and are considered an indicator species, and it is believed to support an additional 1,750 to 2,000 species of plants.[7] The central part of the desert is sparsely populated, while its peripheries support large communities such as Las Vegas, Barstow, Lancaster, Palmdale, Victorville, and St. George.</Review>

< Review>
Lived on Edwards AFB for 5 years. Had so much fun playing in the desert when I was a kid !!!! The only bad thing that happened was that our dog playboy fell into one of the tarpits and was covered up the the neck in a mound of tar. The MPS brought him by the house for us to say goodbye. It was so sad. But I would go back in a skinny minute if I had the chance. Edwards had everything for kids to have a great time living there !!! I could go on and on... Well I sorta did anyway...

<review>Sucks ... Just leaving park ... Boring and near total waste of time. Made worse as a cop gave ticket with not a single speed limit sign. So a little biased but it was boring. No signs to either the peak hike or mine trail so we came back after 2.5 miles.

First 10 seconds are not better than trees you see from freeway. At least no charge other than a ticket trap. 0 stars< /review>< name>

<Review>(Translated by Google) A beautiful nothing. There is everything from hills, plants, small water holes to just sand. At the lowest point you jump from shadow to shadow because it has a stinging 45 degrees e.g. at the visitor center. Giant dry salt lake where many hike and take pieces of salt with them. Get some shoes (sharp stones / heat). A picnic at night shows as many stars as rarely seen because there is no light pollution. Vegas can be seen in weak light in the distance (if you lose your orientation) Small places, scorpions, jackals, beautiful colors or just sand-colored. So the DV is not that dead either. Military base and dead straight highway. Wow.

(Original)
Ein schönes Nichts. Von Hügeln, Pflanzen, kl Wasserlöcher bis nur Sand gibt es alles. Am tiefsten Punkt springt man von Schatten zu Schatten da es stechende 45 Grad hat  z.B. am Visitor Center. Riesen trockener Salzsee wo viele wandern und Salzstücke mitnehmen. Schafft einige Schuhe (Scharfe Steine/Hitze). Nachts ein Picknick zeigt so viele Sterne wie selten gesehen da es keine Lichtverschmutzung gibt. Vegas sieht man an schwachem Licht in der Ferne (falls Orientierung verloren) Kleine Orte, Skorpione, Schakale, schöne Farben oder nur sandfarben. So tot ist das DV also auch nicht. Militärbasis und schnurgerader Highway. Wow.</Review><userid>115296417740234684548</userid>< resp>

<review>(Translated by Google) From Las Vegas to Joshua Tree National Park we drove all the way.
The infinite road blanket was there, but I was more alarmed by its boredom, stinginess ... with all my respect for the plants and animals that live there ... and was accompanied by the feeling that it could hide many secrets!

Las Vegasból át Joshua Tree nemzeti parkba tartva végig autóztunk rajta.
A végtelen út fíling megvolt, de nekem inkább riasztó volt a maga kopárságával,szúrósságával...minden tiszteletem az ott élő növényeké, állatoké... és végigkísért az érzés, hogy sok titkot rejthet,!<//review>< Pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) A wild and beautiful desert. For the first time in my life, I heard silence. Lovely sunsets. Please bear in mind that the terrain is treacherous - especially poisonous snakes, so dress appropriately and exercise extreme caution. I recommend longer stops - meditators will love this place.

Dzika i przepiękna pustynia. Po raz pierwszy w życiu usłyszałem ciszę . Cudowne zachody słońca . Proszę mieć na uwadze zdradliwość terenu - szczególnie jadowite węże, więc warto odpowiednio się ubrać i zachować szczególną ostrożność . Polecam dłuższe postoje - osoby medytujące pokochają to miejsce.<//review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Going through it was a wonderful experience. I was lucky that it rained in areas and when I lowered the car window, I was surprised that it didn't smell like wet earth! It smelled like cactus !!! It was incredible. Look closely at cacti because they are not the typical long ones.

(Original)
Atravesarlo fue una experiencia maravillosa. Tuve la suerte de que por zonas llovía y al bajar la ventana del coche, me sorprendió que no olía a tierra mojada!  Olía a cactus!!!. Fue increíble. Fijate bien en los cactus porque no son los típicos largos.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Beautiful, I had set the external thermometer of the machine in degrees farenight and I had not realized the heat that was when I went down to go to the bathroom were impressive 43 degrees. Beautiful scenery every now and then rest areas with spotless bathrooms and vending machines for drinks and snacks. Staff always present.

(Original)
Bellissimo, avevo settato il termometro esterno della macchina in gradi farenight e non mi ero reso conto del caldo che faceva quando sono sceso per andare in bagno erano 43 gradi impressionante. Scenario stupendo ogni tanto aree di sosta con bagni pulitissimi e distributori di bibite e merendine. Personale sempre presente.<//review>
