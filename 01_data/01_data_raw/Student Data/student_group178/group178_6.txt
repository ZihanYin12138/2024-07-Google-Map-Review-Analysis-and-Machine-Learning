Good pizza and cheap. Had to wait 10 to 15 minutes because I order a cheese pizza. 🍕🍕🍕<//Review>

It's good for what it is. A place for take-out pizza. They improved on their procedures and added new cool features: stuff crust, extra pepperoni, pretzel crust.<//Review>

<Review>Wanted a thin crust pizza it wasn't available till 4 to 8...     okay then give me a $6 pizza and some cheesy garlic bread oh wait not available till 4 to 8.. again a 4 to 8 dinner time only item,
The bottom line if you want something specific you better  just show up between 4 & 8 otherwise you may not get what you want<//Review><username>William Hogan< /username>< rating>

<Review>I love this particular Little Caesars pizza! I'm able to order ahead and drive down the street and pick up from the ToGo Warmer instead of waiting around for my order. Not only that though, their crust and bread sticks are ALWAYS soft!</Review>< date>

<Text>Service has been terrible, have been here numerous times. Called in an order, they refused to acknowledge it. Also checked to ensure we had the right address and phone number, the employee couldn’t care less. The pizza tastes burnt, the bread sticks were not cooked through. If the employees would at least give some decent service it would make up for the terrible food.
This chain in other states has been phenomenal, this store in particular is terrible</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

We love the cheap fast pizzas. It's even faster now when you order using the online or app option. It came with free bread sticks as well. It was self serve/ vending machine style, when we went to pic our pizza up. Very easy and fast!< /Review>

This place is closed right now. The time is 3:50 pm. I cannot order a pizza right now. There are people in their receiving their pizzas. I was just told they can't make any more pizzas. When does a pizza place not have the ability to make pizzas?! I wasn't given any reason why people were in the lobby and yet they were still closed. Whenever is Little Caesars closed?!Now I see why there's a line out onto the street for the nearby burger joint drive-thru. This will be the last time I come to THIS Little Caesars. I'll drive 5 miles more to get go somewhere else.<//text>

But I thought I might as well share that I learned to check my order the next time, as one time I thought I've saved time when I was handed a Hawaiian pizza when I expected it's up to 15 minutes wait. Got there, put order and I was handed a Hawaiian pizza. No waiting. Got home, and only then discovered it isn't freshly made, maybe it was someone's order who didn't show up.< /review>< user_name>

Whatever you do DO NOT use the METABANK ATM. My debit card was stuck in the machine for 15 minutes. Do yourself a favor and just use the chase bank atm in the Jack in the Box parking lot. The pizza was good...very meaty< /Text>

The staff at this location said they can't make a classic pepperoni pizza because cooperate wants to make more money so  they have to sell only extra most bestest( more pepperoni) which my kids don't like slot of...this is crazy I hope they do something about this,scamming customer's< /Review>

This is the second time I come here since it’s close to my home and both times have been a disappointment. Last time the pizza was cold and this time it’s just plain disgusting doesn’t even look like a pizza I wish I knew how to insert a picture but man hella disappointed going to have to start going to another location. This location sucks!<//review>

Got two orders of a thin crust pizza for my girlfriend and I. Came home and finish one box. Brought one box of pizza at work and boom! Two hours later all gone! That’s all i gotta say about that. Follow me on...

<Review>The smokehouse pizza was great, if a little light on the meat. The 10 minute wait turned into 24 minutes, though.< /Review>< rate>

<Review>(Translated by Google) But lately in several branches there is not what I want they must remove the products that they no longer make ...
The only place I can find is at the University. ...
And it is far away ...

(Original)
Pero últimamente en varias sucursales no hay lo que quiero deben de quitar los productos que ya no hacen ....
Ennel unico lugar que encuentro es en el de la University. ...
Y me queda lejos..<//Review>< user_id>

(Translated by Google) The pizzas are very good for the price they are in, do not demand much for 79 pesos, the pizza is very good for the price, the price is accessible if you want a good and cheap pizza because you already know where to look, 4 Stars because they don't have home delivery, you have to go for them and on the way home they get cold

(Original)
Estan muy buenas las pizzas para el precio en el que estan, no exijas mucho por 79 pesos , se me hace muy bien la pizza para el precio , es accesible el precio si quieres una buena pizza y barata pues ya sabes en donde buscar , 4 estrellas porque no tienen servicio a domicilio , tienes que ir por ellas y en la ida a tu casa se enfrian</text>

I had the best tasting tripa taco I have ever had. Its was nice and crispy and with such great flavor. Then I grabbed up a chorizo quesadilla, was not disappointed at all. The quesadilla was not greasy like I was thinking it would be. It was packed with chorizo and cheese.  I definitely found my spot in good ole Gilroy.</review>

<rate>3< /rate><Review>I love coming to this place it's the best tacos around I have been coming for long, unfortunately today (09/20) wasn't the day.  The female cashier I believe is new was so rude with really bad customer service. I would ask for something and she would like get mad. Then she charges prices that aren't right I understand you are new and learning but at least have a better attitude. Other than that still love the food but this lady made my lunch a bad experience.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x8091e3b97dac80bf:0xd13826e0773fdef6< /gmapID></record>

Fresh made tortillas on your tacos, priceless. I notice they serve barbacoa de borrego meaning sheep.  Delicious this spot has a unique flavor I recommend to try the food.<//text>

Just bought this tonight & didn't realize they messed up my order til I checked in my hotel. I ordered an grilled chicken torta with no cheese because im lactose intolerant & I can't have fried food. Instead, they gave me this greasy sandwich with different meat. & my girl ordered their Posole, & it hardly has any meat on it. It mainly has fat. The Tacos my girl & mom ordered was either missing cheese or sour cream. I can't believe I spent $50 for this unsatisfying order.< /review>

Big taqueria! Good tacos.  Open late hours.  Homemade tortillas... amazing.  Good seasoning on the meat.  You add your preferred toppings.  Aqua de Jamaica was fresh and good.<//review>

< Review>
Was downtown Gilroy looking for a place to eat, when out of the corner of my eyes I caught the  tacos del Guero sign. After flipping a U-ee we pulled into a fairly sizable parking lot that has plenty of parking just for their business.
There is some nice signage on the building.
As I walked inside I noticed the left side where all the seating is was blacked out.
they are definitely a mom and pop “ask the locals” kind of place.
. I asked the lady if she had a menu and she said no  however she spent the time to let me know what kind of meats and food they served.
The ladies behind the counter were super nice and even smiled when I took  pictures.
Wifey needs to use the rest room, they were nice enough to let her use it, even With this crazy “Ch-eye-na” virus going on.
They have condiments underneath a steel closed lid container that you can access yourself.
I ordered a super burrito with L Pastore and wifey ordered three street tacos one with Carnitas and two with steak. They will give you salsa red, green or both on the side, The green was super flavorful with very little heat, the red was more for us spicy loving people but I felt the flavor was not quite as developed as the green.
When I tore open my burrito the first thing I noticed was the shell had been toasted nicely and actually had a really good flavor the burrito had beans, rice, juicy help Pastor meet, with whole cut avocado slices inside. Adding the green salsa added a whole “nother” dimension to the flavor.
The price point is actually really good at this place at $9:50 per person including drinks.
Bottom line..... good food, service and price. “I’ll be back”<//Review>

Tacos were tasty and the salsa bar had a lot of variety with home made salsa. This is more of a take-out place as decor and ambiance were lacking.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Here I have come to eat and with all due respect, the food has no flavor and not even because they grill handmade tortillas. They have no flavor or their meats ......... as they already have time there in the freezer and then they heat it up for you. I do not recommend here and spend your money

(Translated by Google) The tacos de asada were good about 6 months ago when they cooked the meat over charcoal, now the tacos taste terrible just like those made with al pastor, they taste like recycled fat.
The guts are still good, so I give it a star.
The head studs are sometimes even raw.
The service is also very, very late, and you have to check the orders well because they almost always do poorly when you order many tacos.
REALLY WERE GOOD TACOS AND FOR A TIME HERE THEY DROPPED THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT, I HOPE AND THE BATTERIES ARE ON.

(Original)
Los tacos de asada estaban buenos hace como 6 meses cuando hacían la carne al carbón, ahora los tacos saben malísimos al igual que los de al pastor, saben como a grasa reciclada.
Los tacos de tripa aun saben buenos por eso doy una estrella.
Los tacos de cabeza a veces están hasta crudos.
El servicio también es muy pero muy tardado, y hay que revisar bien las ordenes porque casi siempre las dan mal cuando pides muchos tacos.
DE VERDAD ERAN BUENOS TACOS Y DE UN TIEMPO PARA ACÁ DEJARON CAER LA CALIDAD DEL PRODUCTO, OJALA Y SE PONGAN LAS PILAS.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) This place is going from bad to worse. To the tacos or mulitas the first thing that stands out is the fat and if you asked for something extra, they very kindly tell you yes but you get home and surprise they do not comply with what you asked. I no longer return to this place anyway its prices are NOT cheap or even fair.

(Original)
Este lugar va de Mal en peor. A los tacos o mulitas lo primero que destaca es la grasa y si pediste algo extra muy amablemente te dicen si pero llegas a tu casa y sorpresa no cumplen con lo que pediste. Ya no mas vuelvo a este lugar de todos modos sus precios NO son baratos ni siquiera justos.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) My order took 30min and when I got to 3 ordonez I was ahead of myself. Jamaica Water was very simple. There was nothing super about my super burrito, it lacked the flavor of the food and the sauce. I don't mind paying up to $ 15 for a burrito when it's worth it. Paresia long heel. I have small hands I am 5'5 "give me an idea. I disappoint myself" Tacos Del Guero "excuse me but I'm not coming back.

(Original)
Mi orden tomo 30min y cuando llege avia 3 ordonez adelanto de mi. La Agua de Jamaica estava muy simple. My super burrito no tenia nada de super le faltava savor a la comida y a la salsa. No me importa pagar asta $15 por un burrito cuando vale la pena. Paresia taco largo. Tengo las manos pequeñas mido 5'5" dense una idea. Me desepciono "Tacos Del Guero" disculpeme pero no vuelvo.< /Review>

< Review>
For quite some time I’ve been trying out different vets in hopes of finding the perfect fit for myself and my fur babies. I am happy that i finally found the one! This place is wonderful!
The vet came out to personally talk to me and allowed me to discuss my thoughts and concerns. The staff were attentive and friendly over the phone. I love it here!< /Review>

<Review>The services and doctor are awesome. They saved us thousands of dollars and help saved my mother’s puppy from parvo.  The emergency vet wanted $5000 to treat our baby and gave us a 50/50 chance of survival. We couldn’t afford what the emergency vet wanted so San Gabriel Animal hospital doctor help guide us and provided us with what we needed to care for our baby at home overnight. Then we would bring her back the next day for checkup and IV. The doctor was sympathetic and caring unlike any other places. He is truly amazing and has a kind heart to our baby.

They did not ask for my credit card before helping us. He help us first and I had to ask him where to pay afterwards. I was shock at how inexpensive it was. They provided everything and more than the emergency vet could ever do.

Yes even with the great help it is tough to do it yourself because it takes days and nights. But if you can’t afford it, what other options do you have. At least with this doctor he gives you a chance and help you with his heart.

Thanks doc we love you and princess is now healthy and happy.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2d018292edd4d:0xf8f50a3fa9535dbd< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I Love this place. They are Such good people and so reasonably priced. It’s true that they can get super busy so there can be a wait,  and it may take you a couple of days to get an appointment at times, but in my experience if there’s an emergency they will do everything in their power to get you in and help. Dr Kiaei is also truly caring and the best vet I’ve seen. Even my super intense cat who will hiss at anyone who tries to hold him if he’s not in the mood let’s the Doc examine him without a fuss. He seems to understand that he’s there to help. I find other vets to be Way overpriced. Here they are reasonable and don’t do extra stuff you do t need. Lastly, the front office staff and caring and  very nice inspire of the enormous amount of work they have for what seems to be every minute of every work day. Great job guys! 💚<//review>

I was referred to this office when I felt my current one was disappointing. I am so THANKFUL to have finally found a vet and office that are honest and passionate about their business. The pricing is the best I’ve ever experienced and the doctor’s professionalism is priceless. I have taken my dogs & cat’s there for care.</review>

Dr. K and his team offer services at reasonable prices, and visits are generally short but meaningful. I highly recommend SGAH for all your pets’ needs.<//Text>< Pictures>

I appreciate the care that my pets (a dog, and a cat) receive from San Gabriel Animal Hospital. Everyone at the office is very professional, and I trust them with my furry babies. I also appreciate that they don't push anything additional that is not necessary. I'm very pleased with their service.</Text>

I was able to get an appointment quickly. Staff was friendly and compassionate. The veterinarian was patient, a good listener, and knowledgeable. Their price are very reasonable. My cat was sick for a long time, unable to be helped by his prior vet, i was thinking there wasn't going to be anything i could do for him. This place gave me hope.< /Review>

My dog has been going here for the past two years for dental cleaning. Luckily, knock on wood, he has not have anything major needed. San Gabriel Animal Hospital prices are very reasonable and the work they do is solid. When I was calling around, another place in the local area quoted me at a starting price of $800 for dental cleaning. Really, $800??? This is also the place that charges $55 for a vet visit when San Gabriel Animal Hospital charges $33. My experience here has been solid and I recommend you give them a try before you get ripped off elsewhere.<//review>

< review>
I share this from my own experience. This was my fur baby's primary vet  for the last 5 years. Last year around October I notice my baby was coughing and  his breathing was a bit off. I took him to the vet about 5-6 times from October to December. The vet although very nice simply stated he had allergies, but never did any lab work or any exams. Which i now wish i should have pushed for, but my ignorance in this case won. The last time I took him in December he was just not well. The vet simply stated he was overweighed (which in reality was liquid retention). That same night around almost 1am I had to rush him to an emergency animal hospital because he wasn't breathing well. I hospitalized my baby for about a week and I thought he would come home, but he was diagnosed with pneumonia and he didn't get better. Sadly i had to make the most painful decision of my life to let him go because he was just suffering and no amount of treatment was helping. He was so attached to me and i know that he was scared and wondering where i was and with covid i was unable to even visit him. Anyways I finally had the courage to write this with tears and guilt because even though I know It was my responsibility to have have taken him somewhere else for a second opinion, I write this in hopes of helping someone.  Yes the vet there is kind but I think they have to many clients and cant provide the best care. I write this because if you have a similar experience please take your fur baby's somewhere else for a second opinion honestly the cost is the least important thing. It's been a month and a half now and I still cant manage my loss.< /review>

As I saw in other reviews, don't let the looks of the building deceive you. Dr. K is a kind, generous, caring doctor. He cares about his patients and also their owners. It is worth being patient with the COVID19 safety protocols. Dr. K is working 6-7 days a week to try to meet the demand caused by clinics limiting their intakes due to COVID. Just bring a book to read or podcast to listen to in the car while you wait your turn. My dog's biopsy cost almost half of what I normally pay in Mammoth Lakes and Dr. K alerted me that my dog's labs were off, recommended I get her on supplements, and scheduled a follow up to try to figure out why her liver function is off. Finding someone who is 'pro-active' is so rare these days. The community is lucky to have such a wonderful human being to care for their pets!</review>

I said "no way" and looked for other options. A friend recommended San Gabriel Animal Hospital. Although it is not nearby, I trusted my friend's recommendation and her assurance that the price would be much lower and drove over to Monterey Park for my cat's dental cleaning.

I dropped my cat off, then left to do some work at a nearby cafe. When I returned at the time the vet staff asked me to return, I was told my cat was still drowsy from the medicine and they wanted to keep her for another hour or so to make sure she was good to go home. It was a bit inconvenient having to leave and come back, but I appreciate that the vet had my cat's health in mind.

I picked up my cat and she was fine. Her teeth looked good, so I trust the dental cleaning was done effectively. The best part: the price was less than $300 total, much lower than the $1,300-$1,500 the other vet had quoted me!

I was satisfied with my visit to San Gabriel Animal Hospital and will plan to go there the next time my cat needs routine care.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTxl9wGhk71Hy9T6_tk0o61XmvnfiL9DG5XYel=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOm_hdOvMWcNOYpZg9C9SYgrbBKa1znLWzwPyZ3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2d018292edd4d:0xf8f50a3fa9535dbd</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I would recommend San Gabriel animal Hospital to everyone. The Dr. is great and has saved 3 of our cat and 1 Shih Tzu. If it wasn't for his talented education our animal family would have passed away. His office is always busy and there is a wait time during this pandemic. Patience is required. Our Shih Tzu had kidney failure and he diagnosed it perfectly. I learned how to administer an IV bag to rehydrate her. She is doing well. 2 of our cats had Cat parvo and with medication and educating us how to administer antibiotic they made it thru this difficult time. Our other cat was bitten by a coyote on it tail. The tail had to be amputated. He educated us again for treatment at home after the operation. I would give them 10 STARS if it was available. (Part 2) We have a family of Shih tzu's and we are going to set up an appointment for all of them to get there shot and check ups. by the way the cats are FERAL and we give them homes and food. So far we have 6 that are tame enough to touch.<//Text>

<text>I am so happy to finally find a veterinarian who is not just trying to empty your pocket by playing on the love you have for your pet.  After years of looking for a kind, knowledgable reasonably priced vet, I came to San Gabriel Animal Hospital (secretly recommended by a receptionist at an expensive vet's office).  I live in Westwood but don't mind the 20 minute drive to have a great vet.  I saw 2 other vets and spent hundreds of dollars to help my dog who is suffering from allergies, Dr. B took care of the problem within a couple of weeks for a fraction of what I had already paid to other Vets without results.  Cam't recommend enough!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Text>Dr. Kiaei is a very good vet, caring towards our animals, and kind to us, their family. He  explains issues and various treatment possibilities in an understandable manner.  The staff I've encountered over the years also listen to your concerns, and are caring and accommodating.
It is a small, older building, hence social distancing means waiting outside until you are admitted.
Staff attitude means much more to me than an impressive building  or the latest shiny gadgets, here they have always been friendly, ethical, professional, and empathetic.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>If you are looking for a good veterinarian  look no further! I been taking my dog here for over 2 years I never have issues getting a appointment. Mercy the girl in the front is so accommodating and friendly. I truly trust the doctor and his recommendations  and that his diagnosis is solely based on what is needed for my dogs Molly Niggles and now my new member to our family Frank. Don't just go by my review try them and u can thank me later😉</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I have been seeing the vets in here since 2016 and they are very professional and caring. Excellent price and most importantly to me, they won’t ask people to do those unnecessary test to make more money. However, I never see the vet on time I made appointment for. I had to wait at least 40 mins to a hour after my appointment time. If I’m going on a weekday I had to request half day off because that’s how much time I gonna waste there, waiting.</Text>

San Gabriel Animal Hospital provides exemplary service with kind thoughtfulness. Love my Vet office and am super grateful for Dr. K and entire staff; seeing Mercy there is always comforting, same way as when I used to see Violet with old doctors. Dr. K is simply amazing prompting my earlier expression of gratitude. A blessing to have a great Veterinarian Doctor like we have in Dr. K<//text>

The first time I came here was back in 2010.   They use to have discounted prices one day out of the week and it was nice to have that .  Hope they bring it back. Overall they have great prices, and customer service.  I've brought my sister's dog here and refereed my daughter to this place as well.  She really liked how they answered her questions and when she was unsure they were happy to explain again ...</Text>

<Review>First time here, I dropped off my cat for a teeth cleaning..Got a call from staff later that day saying she had 3 bad teeth that absolutely had to be removed and I should come in to discuss the price. I was so confused, I mentioned to them that she was a young cat and for her to have so much damage at her age..wasn't that very unusual?

They got back to me a few seconds later, It turns out they had made a mistake and the file was not hers. I want to believe it was an honest mistake but it did seem a bit suspicious..< /Review>< pictures>

I took my puppy here for a check up since I had just got him from the breeder. The place is pretty small and a little cramped but it’s fairly clean. I took a star away because the parking lot is small as well so if it’s busy it can be very difficult to find a spot and when I had to use the restroom I couldn’t find the light switch (maybe the light burned out?) . The staff was very friendly and helpful. The vet was informative and made great suggestions. I feel he was very thorough and explained things easily. The best part is they don’t over charge for services and vaccines. The prices were very reasonable and they made sure to get all my information right and make it easy to schedule another appointment. Just based on customer service and quality of care I would return.</Review>

Update:
Dr. K continue to be a valued partner in the health of our animals.  He's willing to exam and treat even our chicken and ducks,  along with our dogs and cats.  He's very gentle and expert in the handling of each,  really taking the time to assess the natural movement of the injuries or symptoms of the illness.  With 3 dogs,  4 cats,  6 Chickens and 3 ducks in our menagerie, it gives us peace of mind that each is cared after consistently by this knowledgeable and compassionate professional that is Dr. K!

Original review :
We take all of our dogs and cats to the San Gabriel Animal Hospital. They are convenient, thoughtful and reasonably priced. The office staff remember all of our animals names and ours too on sight. ;-) Dr. K is an exceptional veterinarian! He has really proven himself time and again to be VERY committed to our pets health balanced and respect for our household budget. He will take the necessary time and patience with both pet and let owner to understand the complete picture. We highly recommend Dr. K and the San Gabriel Animal Hospital!<//Text>

First time taking my puppy to this clinic, and I couldn’t be happier with her treatment! From the moment we walked in we felt how caring the staff was. The receptionist was sweet and very nice to my dad and I. I left my puppy for a spay, microchip, and a sanitation trim on her paws. When I mentioned my puppy’s umbilical hernia, she told me about the process for fixing it during a spay, quoted me a price for the procedure, then called me back less than twenty minutes after I left to let me know she spoke with the doctor and wanted to confirm the quote. When she took my puppy to the back she was so sweet with her that my dog wasn’t scared despite usually being very skittish and nervous around strangers. Pick up was easy, and Dr. Kiaei himself came out to tell me about care instructions, to run through how the surgery went, and to schedule a follow-up to remove her stitches. Thank you San Gabriel Animal Hospital for the wonderful care! Little Adora is doing very well during her recovery :)< /Text>

Dr. takes his time and is thorough. You don't feel that he's "padding the bill", you just feel that he cares. Some front staff are a little cool, especially when you come in late in the day and apparently they want to go home.< /text>

But, the veterinarian is why I keep bringing my pets here. He genuinely cares about animals.

I honestly love this place! It’s small, but the staff is extremely nice and always answers all of my questions. Mercy is great! She explained the aftercare procedure for the spray and the price came with the cone, painkillers, and antibiotics. We were debating whether or not to spay her at a shelter but decided to come here since it is our regular vet. The prices are way better than other vets!!< /Review><time>1557427295941</time>< pics>

I am grateful to Dr. K and his staff, they were very kind and helpful to me when I took Valentino in for emergency visit. My Valentino passed away a week later but he received the most caring treatment from Dr K. I stopped going to my previous Vet at Veterinary Healthcare Center on Pomona Blvd after being a customer for 15 years, now Dr K is our Vet. My reasons are: the knowledge and honesty of Dr K ,caring and kindness of his staff.  The fees are very reasonable/affordable which helps reduce anxiety and stress of pet owner who is dealing with illness of their furry baby. I recommend this clinic to anyone who love their pets.<//Text>

Don't let whole time we're having to leave a message to Scrooge you are very busy there's only two people up front a job for only Superstars because it's stressful.

I've been taking my Mastiffs to SGAH since early July after one of my Mastiffs suffered from a wound in her paw that would not heal. Dr K is very knowledgeable and caring. Her wound is getting better but not completely healed yet. We are still going back every couple of weeks for a recheck. Dr K seems to want to see this through to make sure my dog is fully healed.  The staff is very friendly and nice, too. My Mastiff is usually scared to go to a vet, but she seems fine with this office. I'm surprised she does not bark at other dogs and people in the waiting room like she was doing at another vet's office. The office itself is small but clean. The fee is very reasonable and affordable. I trust Dr. K completely!<//review>

Great vets who care for the animals they treat. Their prices are much more affordable than other pet hospitals. My Pomeranian was dying of auto-immune disease and first vet said it will be a lot of money, too much to treat as they were charging 500+ for blood, xrays etc (each).  This vet treated and got this disease under control.  Best I have been to.</Text>

We are a patients in this clinic for the last 8 years. Doctors always change. Dr K is there for some time now. He is very nice and patient. Today we saw a new Dr and I liked him very much as well. He’s very sweet and attentive. The staff are super friendly. Mercy has been working there for a while and I really like her. She is always trying to help. The new girl Ashley is very sweet too. Better to stay away from the Drs but if I have to take My baby I’d come here again.
The only thing I want to note is that I wish the floors can be a little cleaner. That’s all</review>

<review>First off I would like to say that although this facility may be small, the decor outdated, and there are at times a wait, Dr. Kiaei (Dr. K) and the veterinary assistants always provide utmost care for my pets. Dr. K is knowledgeable, confident, and goes above and beyond when caring for my furry ones. Mercy, one of their receptionists, always knows me and my cats by name. She is personable, patient, and always willing to help answer my questions.

Over the years I have brought numerous (12+) cats/kittens to be spayed and neutered by Dr. K. They kept the kitties there for a few hours after surgery to make sure they were recovering well. There were no complications at home and everyone healed nicely.

I've gone to several veterinary facilities in the surrounding area and by far they are the most affordable. You can't beat the level of care, knowledge, and dedication Dr. K has for his patients. One of my kitties was very ill and needed to be hospitalized for several days. Dr. K would drive back and forth from his home to the hospital several times throughout the night to administer medication, check her IV line, and make sure my little girl was doing alright. How many non-emergency facilities have a Veterinarian this dedicated? Most places would send you to an emergency veterinary clinic for overnight care which costs an arm and a leg. Honestly, I'm not sure how Dr. K got any sleep during this time, but I am grateful he kept me up to date with her progress and was there to care for her.

Like most places sometimes there is a wait. As a pet owner and someone who frequents medical offices, understanding that emergencies occur and need to be seen ASAP should be recognizable. If I know I need to be somewhere I schedule an appointment either as the first appointment of the day, or the first appointment right after lunch. They do their best to keep on schedule while trying to accommodate those pets who need to be seen sooner. It's easier to understand when your pet has been in a position for needing urgent care.

Overall I recommend San Gabriel Animal Hospital to anyone looking for affordable care and a Veterinarian dedicated to his profession and the well-being of his patients.</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Text>I highly recommend San Gabriel Animal Hospital, the staff is exceptional and Dr. K is the utmost professional/extraordinary doctor I have ever met. He was very compassionate and attentive when it came to diagnosing my fur baby. I am beyond grateful to Dr. K especially since a few other hospitals didn't want to treat and or just wanted to over charge to see my pup, he was able to accommodate us last minute on a Saturday and was able to assure me that he would find what was making my pup sick. He was very thorough with all exams necessary to make my pup feel better. Beyond appreciate to have found Dr. K. I will never go elsewhere. Recommending him to everyone I know.<//Text><username>Joy S< /username><rate>5<//rate><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We are so glad to have found San Gabriel Animal Hospital.  Dr. K is truely a great vet that care about animals and with extensive medical knowledge.  We have been coming here for my cats and dogs the last 6 years. The rates are very fair priced.
I have tried 4 other facilities, just not enough compassion, and rates are extremely expensive.

I suggest to Give San Gabiel Animal Hospital a try,  you will won’t regret.</Review><GmapID>0x80c2d018292edd4d:0xf8f50a3fa9535dbd<//GmapID>< name>

Great Doctor and Staff! Have been coming here for a few years now and the doctor genuinely cares for the animals. He saved my husky who was dehydrated and needed to be put on a special diet with iv. Prices are very affordable as well.<//Review>

I've been to quite a few vets around the neighborhood and I must say...it's always a pleasant experience visiting San Gabriel hospital.
The doctor is the best I've ever encountered.  Not only is he passionate about what he does but he is truly a compassionate individual.
His assistant was just as or even more compassionate than the doc.
Overall,  my experiences with them is always pleasant.  Even my buddy who helped deliver my dog to the vet has decided to go with them.
That pretty much sums it up.
Great people!</review>

This is a great place. I’ve been going here with my dog for 2 years now and I had no complaints. Dr.Kiai knows what he is doing and we totally trust him with our fur baby. The prices are also reasonable compare to other places. Highly recommend.< /text>

extremely small waiting room with a wall filled of sponsored items behind the counter. I waited an hr to get called into a dirty and dusty exam room. I proceeded to wait another hour for a doctor that gave my dog a quick exam. Didnt tell me what was wrong until I confronted him with my theories. then he gave me medication with no knowledge of how long the treatment is. he had to call in a nurse to explain how to use the medication.<//Text>

He was also supportive of my time and my animals to compromise a schedule, even if it meant he had to take on more on his plate than he should. I have nothing but the utmost respect for him and his staff. I've been to two different vets and the level of care here is much higher than the previous. I consider this my Vet Hospital. Thank you very much for your care and love.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>I lovED this place....emphasis on the past tense. Frankly, I know they do not need my patronage because they are never NOT busy. They are so busy, they do not have time to call in prescriptions or to correct a wrong.

Dr told me that he would call in a prescription to the Alhambra Costco and did not. (Meds were for my paralyzed dog due a herniated disc that occurred 48 hrs previously.) I found out my prescription was not there only when I arrived at the pharmacy, and by then, the office was closed, so I fought 2 hour-plus traffic for nothing!!! Then Mercy called me the next day, never referencing my voice message or apologizing for the inconvenience. She told me she had just called the Monterey Park Costco. I asked for it to be sent to the one in Alhambra. She told me that she would.  Then, on a Saturday night, moments before the pharmacy would close, again, after fighting 2 hour plus traffic from the specialist in Tustin, battling the typical struggles to find parking at Costco on a Saturday, to barely make it to the pharmacy before it would close, I was told again that there was prescription waiting for me.

In tears and extremely frustrated (because I was also facing the decision to proceed with back surgery,) I left a message for someone to call me if they "respected me as a human and as a patron of their hospital." Two plus weeks later, my desperate cries for help were left unanswered.

Today, two weeks after the fact, I called to speak to someone. The phone rang many times. This was not typical. Usually, someone would answer within a 2 rings and place me on hold. This time was different; I knew Mercy was avoiding my call. How did I know? Because my number shows up when I call, that's when she DID NOT answer. I called right back with my number blocked and she picked up right away.

Of course she made excuses and "apologized" and fed me a line of "I never got your message"... but all of that disrespected me so much, knowing that she only picked up my call when she DID NOT see my number appear.

I am so very disappointed by the lack of professionalism, compassion and human decency by Mercy. She had previously treated me with such kindness and I had always looked forward to speaking with her. She calls everyone "mija" which made me feel like she cared, but now I know differently.< /review>< Pictures>

They didn’t have a single second to spare today and weren’t accepting walkins, but no one else could see my extremely sick dog till much later in the day. I wasn’t sure we could wait that long.  The very kind staff worked the schedule around to help us out as well. Been here less than 15 mins and dog is already been seen and her treatment under way. That’s type of place this is always willing to help out an animal in need. This place is definitely worthy of a 5 star rating.< /Review><gmapID>0x80c2d018292edd4d:0xf8f50a3fa9535dbd</gmapID><Response>None< /Response><Rate>5< /Rate><name>Hannah Elisabeth Esqueda< /name></record>

San Gabriel Animal Hospital is "the BEST" .  I have 3 dogs and have been to other clinics.  I can tell you that I like this one the most because is the veterinarian is very knowledgeable, and kind.  He shows that he is concern about the well being of each of my pets.  The staff is also very pleasant and helpful.<//text>

We rescued a cat and needed him neutered right away. They got him in the next morning and flea treated, vaccinated, examination, and nails clipped along with the surgery. Batman did so well afterwards, we were so pleased. The doctor and staff were very friendly and accommodating. We will definitely continue to use their services for all 3 of our kitties!<//Review>

Not only is "Dr. K" the best vet we've ever known, but also his whole staff takes personal care and interest in all of their clients and their families.  They do not throw in ANY unnecessary charges (as I've experienced in the past with other doctors) - in fact, they care so much for your pet that they offer the best advice and natural care as well as prescribing only what is needed.  This has the highest rating possible..... Your pet comes first... simple as that!  Thank you, SGAH, for caring for my Bibi!< /Text>< pictures>

He was already shutting down. Unable to lift his head or move!!  Dr. K and the kind, compassionate staff rallied and SAVED PARKER'S LIFE!!  This is not the first time Dr. K has worked his magic. I cannot find the words to let you all know how grateful we all are that Parker is still here with us. The office staff ( from receptionists to vet techs ) and Dr. K work seamlessly to ensure that your pet will get the BEST CARE. Trust this office, they are a God send!!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Super lucky to have found this place. I rescued 4 dogs from an unfit relative and they were scruffy and not in good shape.

I called this place on a Saturday morning and they were able to accommodate us that same day in the afternoon. The dogs got their shots and their ears cleaned as well as treatment for an ear infection & flea treatment all for a very affordable fee.

I adore mom and pop shops like this one. We will continue to bring our new pets here, the staff is young, energetic and friendly and Dr. Kay is very detailed with regards to educating us about our pets needs.

Very pleased with this place especially after having poor experiences in the past with vets in the LA area.

What I loved the most is that we were not upsold on things that were not needed.</text>

Doctor K is a very qualified doctor.  I highly recommend this Hospital to all my friends and family .  If your looking for an honest veterinarian give him a try . You won't be sorry .  I've followed Doctor K for over 10 years and he's never let me down  I give the highest rating and I've known a lot of vets.</Text>

I would highly recommend this animal hospital and Dr.K. We have been through many many Veterinarians and it is almost impossible to find someone who is very knowledgeable and actually cares about your pet and wants to HELP your pet more than anything else. Nothing unnecessary is pushed on you here and you can rest assured that Dr. K is the best you can find to take care of your pets. We will only come here as long as Dr. K is available.</text>

Dr. Kiaei and the staff are awesome.  They are all very professional, attentive and all out kind people.  I've taken 3 dogs into them, 2 to get spayed and the third to take care of her "lady parts".  I'm glad I found them and will continue to go.  Thanks, guys!!!</review>

I am sure that everyone wants to give their pet the best medical treatment available and fight any battle and do every possible test and treatment. In the real world this just isn't possible for all of us. We have been to so many vets that hand you this monster bill at the end of an appointment and one wonders what happened.

At SGAH they intuitively know just how far they need to go. For example our dog, Jack, is 12 yrs old and maybe it is not worth putting him through chemotherapy.

It's hard enough to make these types of decisions for a member of the family without any implied guilt trips. We are VERY happy to have found SGAH and we don't want to tell anyone because we don't want it to get too crowded....

I do know that we won't be searching for a new vet ever again.<//Review>

My dog has a growth.  I brought him in, the doctor told me to do a test on it, so they know what needs to be done.  I ask them why not just took it out.  They told me is best to find out what is the growth.  I did the test for about 200 bucks.  The result is inclusive.  I ask the doctor what is our next step.  He told me to have the surgery for 1200.00.  I ask him should we find out first before we do the surgery.  He told me don't have to find out.  Just go ahead and cut it out.  So I wasted 200 for nothing or they rip me off.  Go there if you want to waste your hard earned money.<//review>

I cannot say enough about the love, care and great service given by everyone at San Gabriel Animal Hospital, especially Dr. K. I highly recommend Dr. K to anyone who has animals, loves them and wants them to receive the best medical care possible. I guarantee you, Dr. K and his staff will not disappoint you. The love, care and compassion my dog MoJo received from Dr. K and his staff, left a lasting impression on me that I will forever cherish. Thank you to Dr. k and the entire staff at San Gabriel Animal Hospital, your hard work does not go unnoticed or unappreciated. Thank you for everything you did for MoJo, I will forever be grateful.< /review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>My sister Teresa referred me to him.  She took her cat everywhere and they couldn't find what's wrong, until she saw this Vet he pinpointed the problem right on. Since then she has a happy healthy cat. I took my little Brandy (canine) he gave a diagnosis that we tried.  He saw her again after two weeks of non improvement free of charge and referred us to Neurology. Again right on the money, she has a herniated disc.  Thank you Doctor for your knowledge,  and we can tell you have a huge heart and really do care about your patience and it shows. Thank you so much

My experience with the San Gabriel Animal Hospital was great. The receptionist was very kind and the doctor examined my cat with great care. Also, the first exam is free, which was a great bonus!<//review>

<Text>Dr. K is awesome and the staff is so friendly and accommodating. Any anxiety I had about taking my pets to vet stopped here. I recently went to a different vet before coming here and I really wish I would have come here first. I would have saved myself a lot of time and money,  plus my cat would've been treated better and faster.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2d018292edd4d:0xf8f50a3fa9535dbd<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<username>wandering athome< /username><review>The man is VERY picky about his cars and who touches them.  He brought in a recent out of state purchase to achieve smog and left with a finely tuned machine running much better for a very reasonable price.  Great service, an understanding of collectors and specialty vehicles, trustworthy and fair.</review></record>

<text>I love this place.  I have been bringing my vehicles here for over 20 years and they have always done an amazing job.  They are very conscientious about their work and reasonably priced.  They work on all of the high end cars like Porsche, Jaguar, Mercedes, BMW and a lot more.  I really appreciate the work that they do and I would highly recommend the team at Kruse Lucas for all of your automotive needs.</text>< Time>

We trust Kruse Lucas with our car.  They are professional and fair.  I came in for regular maintenance and they looked into a possible issue for me. They didn't force an unnecessary repair and explained what was going on.  I feel confident they want the best for their customers.<//text>

Excellent service!! Had been looking to establish somewhere and think we found it. Very friendly, Marcus helped us out from the beginning with explaining everything with detail. They dont do any work without approving first and prices were very reasonable. The work got done in a timely manner and will definitely be coming back.<//Text>

<Review>Chris and the entire staff are professional, personable and friendly. They listened and understood what I needed and took care of it. They did everything in their power to accomplish the job for my older Mercedes. They have a really wonderful atmosphere. I was very comfortable and at ease and quite pleased with their prices. It's a great place to take your car.

Im very pleased I found this shop, they came highly recommended and now I know why. They have friendly staff, honest pricing, a clean shop, and did a great job. And even though they are not located in my area, it's been more than worth the extra mileage to get there. I will return any time I have car troubles. Thank you Kruse Lucas, its been a pleasure...<//text>

<Review>We stopped in for the heck of it as we saw some Porsche's outside the shop, my kids favorite race team. The folks there spent quite a bit of time showing the kids around the shop and talking about the different cars.

Steve, one of the mechanics, was awesome. He really went out of his way to show them a 912 car he was working on and what they were doing. He knows how to talk to kids and keep it fun. Because of Steve, our kids hate two of our cars now! They're automatics and "Real race cars have 3 pedals, Steve said so." The world needs some more Steve's!!

We've visited a handful of times so the kids can see and meet the folks in the business. They're really into it, racing and wrenching. It's folks like Steve and the others we've met who inspire the kids and amplify their interest, especially these days when so many kids just want to play video games.

Always treated us great here even though I have a Dad Mobile and wasn't really patronizing the business. Thanks again guys. See you again soon!<//Review></record>

<review>I’ve been taking my cars to Kruse Lucas for years, and every time service is great. You get a clear and transparent list of the work that has to be done, and cost  before they perform any work. It’s a shop with integrity and they take pride in the work they do.</review><user_name>Patricia Villalpando< /user_name>< pictures>

The staff was very friendly and helpful. They diagnosed my issue I was having with my BMW I just brought from Stark Auto. They found the boost solenoids the dealership replaced were bad and causing my issues. Aimee was very respectful and gave me all the info I needed to proceed with getting my issue resolved. I will be coming back to have service done on my cars in the future.</text>

Kruse Lucas is great! Much cheaper than taking my MINI to MINI for repairs which were needed. They had everything done quick as well! Aimee is great! I had called during lunch. I didn’t leave a message figuring I would call back later after lunch. Before I could call back, Aimee saw that I had called down there and called me back, making sure everything was alright with my car after picking it up! I highly recommend Kruse Lucas!</text>

I'm the owner's brother so I have to give 5 stars. But seriously, the service is top notch and prices are beyond reasonable. With Chris taking over ownership, only good things will come. He's the top mechanic and continues to work on cars and manage the shop. That shows he's got great people working there.< /Review>

I’m new to Modesto and one of the pluses of moving to the area is Kruse-Lucas. My folks moved here previous to me and told me I should bring my car to them, and they did not disappoint.

I’ve been working with them for over a year and they explain everything that is wrong and could go wrong with my car. They have allways let me know I either have time to fix it or need to for safety.

I recently just had to do quite a bit to my car and they informed me of what had to get done and what could wait. They turned my repairs around very quickly and did an amazing job. It’s riding like new. (Thanks Gary)

Glad that even though I still have to still find a lot of new business to trust in Modesto, I now have one to 100% trust with my car.<//Text>

Without checking with customer, they decided that a fuel additive costing $17.48 and a window cleaner for $8.01 is okay to add into the cost of the requested 60k inspection.</Text>

I gave them a 4 rating only because they made a mistake. But after I called them they apologized and I made it right. They owned their mistake. Which means a lot. Honestly is hard to find these days.< /Text>

<user_id>109062547544030868350< /user_id><Text>This establishment is very unprofessional, and will do anything to squeeze money from you. Including cut wires and unplug sensors, once they get their hands on your vehicle they will cause damage to your vehicle that wasn't there before, in order to charge you more money, for repairs and labor and they don't care about the consequences of hurting you while you drive off with a vehicle they purposely made faulty.
I took my Volvo in because of a light, it was a transmission light that needed service nothing eles was giving me problems on my vehicle besides the light that was on. I asked Kruse Lucas to do a diagnostic on my vehicle and pinpoint why the light was on. They made me wait almost one week before I could even bring in my vehicle to be looked at, I also had to take the day off of work just to bring in my  my vehicle  because it would be there all day. Once I got my vehicle back they had not did a full diagnostic on my vehicle and said they were unable to pinpoint what was wrong with the transmission but gave me an estimated for other things they wanted to do on my vehicle like replace all engine mounts, and I just had brand new ones replaced two weeks prior to taking my vehicle into Kruse Lucas. The technician never mentioned to me he unplugged sensors and cut wiring to my vehicle when I paid for their services. Instead when I got my vehicle back he had left me posted notes inside my vehicle and in the engine where he cut and unplugged sensors. Telling me he had done so on post-it notes. As I stopped at the first light down the road I knew there was something very wrong with my vehicle, I was unable to drive my vehicle home to Atwater it wouldn't make it with all the negleces this tech had caused to my vehicle. When I picked up my vehicle it was 5:30 they were all leaving as I drove off, after I hit the first light my vehicle wouldn't accelerate the rmps would hit 3 and 4 but I was barely moving 5mph, I had to pull over to a different shop down the road and ask if someone would help me and take a look at what Kruse Lucas had done to my vehicle. Inside the engine there were post-it notes where the tech had cut wires and unplugged sensors. I watched as the mechanic pulled it out of my engine, I was horrified and couldn't believe someone would do this. It cost me more money to fix what Kruse Lucas had done to my vehicle,  just so I could drive it home. I will never do business with those crooks again. When I spoke to them about what had happened they completely deny everything and could careless about what that technician did to my vehicle. By far its the worse place I've ever been to in my entire life.</Text>< rating>

The team I went to during that day was accommodating and friendly.. I would
Like to commend DESTINY.. she is awesome. She knows what she is doing and is aware of the policies. She is a good advocate for the customer for the customer service representative was unable to answer our questions and telling us different things. It was about the free additional line and half the price off the phone. The rep wants to change our plan, however DESTINY was able to fix it and were able to get the additional line without adding anything on our
Monthly bill. Multitasking is easy for her and she handles everything patiently and very professional. She is an asset of this branch!!!< /review>

Horrible experience. They were talking so rudely. They were also ignoring my questions and it’s sounds like they are forcing you to buy things. Never going here again. Have been to so many other T-mobiles but never ever had this type of experience and the service is really really slow. Never explain in details and it looks like they just want us to pay and leave. Would not recommend this store.</text>

Walked in to this location and I was pretty hesitant because the last time I came in I wasn’t greeted or felt welcome and this time I came in for a bill pay and Destiny greeted me and made me feel welcomed she asked me did you know you qualify for many promotions that are going right now and I told her I didn’t that nobody even takes the time to tell me anything they just ask for my phone number and let me know how much I owe but she told me luckily you have me now and she explained to me what I qualified for and ended up taking a tablet. Thank you Destiny for you’re help. EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!</text>

I came here at 8:10 pm and they denied me entry because they close at 8:00 pm but they had someone in there, I wasn’t even going to be there long I just wanted to get a new screen protector and that’s it. They could’ve just gave it to me and I would’ve put it on my phone myself, I got off work at 7:30 pm and was trying to get here before they close they still could’ve let me in they didn’t even have their bars shut but as soon as I walked away then they shut them, I’m mad but it’s whatever.< /Text>

I came in to this store a couple of days in search of a new phone. I was immediately greeted by Natalie, she made me feel welcomed. I am not a very tech savy person therefore I needed all the help I could get. Anahi was able to help me out choose a phone. She was very helpful and patient with me. If you want the best customer service come to this tmobile.</text>

Wowww !!! This store sure left me speechless it has improved so much since I last visited this location a year ago . As soon as i walked in I was greeted and saw nothing but smiles all around. I went in to pay my phone bill and get information on the New Apple Watch. Roger was very helpful he went that extra mile to make sure he covered all my questions and/or concerns. His knowledge on the Apple Watch was beyond my expectations. I will definitely be back !! Thank you Roger for your help and your great customer service (:< /Review>

<review>Was nearby and decided to stop in to have insurance to my new phone my wife got me. Walked in with my son and did the whole check thing. Walked the around a very unorganized store looking for a case as I waited. And in the meantime of waiting I notice for people walking after me and be helped.

After leaving this poor excuse of a store I gave a customer service a call and got my insurance added within minutes. After that give the store called talk to the store manager and all they could say was I'm sorry.

Work on your customer service and organizer store a lot better really liked how you have the Samsung display with Apple accessories on both sides. Didn't no Apple accessories can fit with Samsung devices.< /review>< rating>

I came into the store because my bill was out of control and high and was not supposed to be that high but gladly the management there really helped me out! Alexis and Daisy really helped me out! They took their time to look into my bill and also contacted customer care for me to explain everything and fixed it! I really appreciate it when people take their time with me cause that shows a lot! Definitely will be coming back!<//Text>

Went in cause I wanted to compare prices with my current carrier to T-Mobile and the rep Alexis was able to explain the benefits and the up and downs about T-Mobile and was able to help me convert over with no problem! I ended up walking out with a brand new iPhone and Apple watch and very good customer service!<//Review>

Came in today to switch our lines over to TMobile. Daisy patiently spent the time to get our accounts established, lines ported over and phones setup. She even spent the time to track down an out of stock device and had it picked up for us. Everything was explained clearly and we couldn’t be happier with the service. Thank you!< /Review>

<review>This place is very slow, I know it's not the workers fault but they still seem quite slow... I've been here three times and each time I walked out because they were very slow at getting to my question/concern. One time it was just one other customer in there and they still didn't get to me within 20 minutes.< /review>< user_id>

They are unprofessional and the manager don't have no idea what she is doing other then just boot people out the door and not assist on helping. They are slow as well as impatient and are not experienced at all. I do not recommend this place.< /Text>

Bad customer service, they don’t inform you about the process of transferring your lines to their Company, if I don’t ask they will never informed me.
Now I have to pay the other company the balance and t mobil is not giving me the reimbursement any time soon.<//Review>

Julian really helped us out during the blackberry promotion, he even asked his coworker to drive to another store to get us a phone that we wanted that wasn't in stock. He did what he needed to do to help us and we were very satisfied customers. The T-Mobile store in Bellflower, Ca is crap compared to this store.< /Review>

This store is not for Any one save for Hispanics. I have never seen Any one but Hispanics that work in There.

They play Hispanic music with no regard to the other races of people that customer this store.

If this was in a black area, the hiring practices would be complained about and people would complain about the music.

I would say this needs to be changed, but I know it won't.

Also, the wait time is ridiculous.< /text>

Walked in and I was not greeted, they said we'll be with you in a moment until half an hour after I had walked in. Then the store closed at 8 and I was still waiting there for some one to help, one guy was too busy chatting about his personal life and after sitting there for an hour I decided to leave. The girl had to open the door for me to leave and as I walked out she said sorry about the wait. She should've said sorry we never helped you!  >:/</Text>

<Text>Came in to the store to purchase a White Galaxy Note 3 for my wife. It was supposed to be a surprise X-Mas gift. The people there were nice and helpful. Unfortunately, I noticed they gave me a black Note 3 and not the white one after a gave it to my wife. Not a problem. I figured i would go back and get it exchanged. I went to the store, asked for a white one and they told me it can only be ordered on line. No stores in the area have the white Note 3. Left the store disappointed, but decided to contact the TMO store in Downey. They told me all corporate stores carried the White Note 3. This one is privately managed by Ritmo Wireless so they get less inventory.
1. Not happy that they gave me the wrong phone.
2. Not happy that they lied to me. Telling me no one in the area carried the White Note 3.
3. The service I got when attempting to return my phone was bad.
Now I know to go to the store in Downey. It's a real TMO store, and they never have a bad attitude.<//Text><Response>None</Response>< Pictures>

Waste of time. Employees don't want to hear the customer, unless it is a sale for them. The so called 'Manager' doesn't get off his/her a*se and gives judgments from the office. Wasted 20 minutes waiting and another 25 minutes on an ineffective back and forth with the kid at the counter. Yeah, sure, I will participate in your new promotions, NOT.<//Review>

Horrible experiences ..they should hire profesional people this kids the only thing they do is mess around and they don't talk to you in a professional way .. the only employee   That gave me a good customer service was Christian very professional I decided to leave them because they could never find my information something was always an issue with them signal was bad .. I had purchase an iPhone at full price and didn't last me not even a month after that they gave a refurbish one same thing I had to go back in there for the same thing  like 3 times they lost all my I movie videos etc too long to explain but I decided to switch
back to Verizon ..I'm  paying about the same if not a couple dollars more but I'm very happy with their customer service their signal overall everything their employees are very professional ..
I don't see any of their Employees trying to flirt with my husband  right in front of me very disrespectful T  mobile we would never go back!!< /review>

<Text>Went this morning 2/4/21 bought two tacos asada 2 burritos asada . The asada was left over from previous night and was actually burned. The flour tortillia was cooked also over cooked. I will not go back again! Sad people put that together knowing it was not good and wrapped it up gave it to customer like that.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I waited more than 20 minutes for my order to end up saying I had to wait longer for the chicken they gave me the order and while I waited for the rest to cool down, most likely never come back it is illogical to give me an order to the half and after 20 minutes have to wait for the rest

(Original)
Me isieron esperar más de 20 minutos por mi orden para que terminaran diciendo que tenía que esperar más tiempo por el pollo me daban la orden y mientras esperaba lo demás se enfría, lo más probable que nunca regrese es ilógico que me den una orden a la mitad y después de 20 minutos tenga que esperar por el resto< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80910d7a9ea939ff:0xb937c7fa9a056b42</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Basic hand rolls. Cut roll sets were good. Service was great. Don't expect an exotic line of fish or those heavily sauced grotesque rolls that taste like a buffet plate blended together. This place serves rolls in the most basic form, nori, sushi rice, fish, cucumber, shellfish, or crustacean. Perfect pairing with a nice cold beer. No Broadway and 3rd Roll. No Sunset at the Beach House roll. No Los Angeles Smog roll. No blah blah jigamajig roll. No fru fru. Just quality service with a simple laid back atmosphere.<//Text>

Good for quick sushi. The cleanliness of the place is questionable, especially the drink dispenser. It's been a very long time since anyone has deep cleaned and it shows.< /Review>

<review>I am a frequent flyer at this establishment. I wish I could spend 20 to 40 on high quality sushi everytime I had an itch but I live within my means (a skill many California's don't possess) *Shade thrown*... For the price, the sushi is of good value... I spend $60 a month here instead of $100 to $200 elsewhere... and its MUCH better than supermarket sushi, the only other budget option... this establishment has marketed itself between grocery sushi and restaurant suishi in both quality and price... a niche in the South Bay Sushi market...</review><user_id>105457612920184263075< /user_id>< Response>

I came here with my son and it's really good. I didn't know they had California rolls here lol they tasted good and I want more. It's more like a snack for me though why can't I post a picture :(

Go here and try it. U won't regret it .<//Review>

<text>Terrible quality. This company is a related to the sushi boy In Japan, but has nothing good. This is not sushi, way out of the question.

Not fresh, rice is not good, soy sauce doesn't match the sushi, and wasabi is terrible. Even if it's fast food, this can't be acceptable. Disgrace to the Japanese food culture of sushi.<//text>< time>

<review>ABSOLUTELY AWESOME sushi deals! I just got home with some chicken teriyaki maki rolls (8, made with chicken, avocado, lettuce, carrot, rice, and seaweed), and they're about 3 - 4 times bigger than the ones I got from that crappy Yanagi Sushi place by Sizzler. Each piece is almost the diameter of a freaking tennis ball. These ones cost less too! AND they go on sale between 2:30pm and 5:30pm every day - $2.25! AMAZING. And they give out 20% off coupons sometimes. They have Ramune sodas. Totally going back there. So great.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Living at Pegasus is overall a pretty good experience. I think given all the places in Downtown Los Angeles Pegasus ranks higher.
Moving in and Moving out is pretty easy, they have a very large freight elevator that makes it much easier than a lot of buildings.
The rooftop pool is definitely a huge bonus to living here. Not many places in Downtown Los Angeles have rooftop pools and views are great. There is also a BBQ area, restrooms, tv lounge area and gym on the roof.
Neighbors on the floor I lived on at least are really nice and very respectful. I've heard that isn't the case for all the floors, I guess it's just lucky. I would say there is a healthy mix of people that live there, some in their 40's-50's and others 20's -30's. They don't have a ton of mixers to meet neighbors but the ones they do have I always met a lot of people.
The cons are the elevators, but you'll find that with a lot of places, I swear a lot of buildings have elevator issues. But when there is only one elevator working you can wait up to 15 minutes until it comes to your floor or the lobby.
The best part about Pegasus is the concierge. Amal was fantastic, always professional, remembers all the residents, and really helpful. I know some people struggled with Management, I personally never did, but I suppose it probably depends on your problem.</Text>

Loved it here. I came here during my Los Angeles trip last month and here are so many picture opportunities. Especially if you're looking for places to take photos. There's lots of artsy landscapes and objects. My favorite being the light poles.<//text>

Dee has been excellent all the way through, I was looking to move months prior to making my decision and Dee made sure I stayed informed with any questions I had. Dee has been so superb and outstanding, that  I’d refer Pegasus to anyone just from having the pleasure of dealing with Dee. Thank you so much for your help, also shout out to Alex and Dorian whom also has been a pleasure. Thank you all.<//Text>< Rate>

<rating>5</rating><review>This was the first place I visited when moving to DTLA and I fell in love instantly. It's been about a month of living here and I absolutely love it! The only thing that kinda sucks is that the washer and dryer is a 2 in 1 and it can only load a small amount of laundry, but luckily there is a laundry room if I ever need to do a big amount of laundry. Other than that I have no complaints whatsoever. I highly recommend moving here!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Not once did I ever have a problem there, and if there was ever any service needing to be done, it was handled so quickly and professionally. The staff here are so nice and welcoming and helped make Los Angeles better. Abe and Avery were always so friendly whenever we saw them at the front, always made sure to say hello. The staff in the leasing office are all amazing humans as well. They actually take the time to help their residents and they are very genuine.

The apartment itself was great! The walls are super thick so you never, and I mean never, hear your neighbors! My one complaint I guess is that the windows seem to be a little thin (historic building so they can't really do much about that), you hear most of the street noises but you get used to it after a little while. The flooring was one of my favorite features of the place, the dark wood just made it look really nice and was easy to take care of. Overall, this place is great. If you want to live in downtown LA, definitely give this place a serious consideration.</Text><date>1561934950712</date>< UserId.>

<rating>5</rating><review>This is long overdue because I moved out 4 months ago, but I already miss this place! The facilities and apartments were great & well-maintained, but it was the management that really made this place home to me for 2 years. Alex was amazing--always so friendly, helpful & professional and genuinely cares for and looks out for the best interests of the residents. He made my entire experience living here--from signing the lease, to helping with any problems that came up, to my move out process--extremely easy and seamless. Avery was also awesome--he knew every resident's name & unit, and helped everyone with a smile and lots of energy. After moving into a different apartment building with more residents and a less competent management team, I can attest to the HUGE difference it makes to have a staff like the one at Pegasus! Thank you guys for a great experience living here :)<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1574870502918, 'text': 'We are thrilled to have earned your positive feedback!

<review>I just moved into the Pegasus and I absolutely love it! See, is fantastic and the  concierge staff is amazing. She made the process for me smooth and stress free. The building has rooftop social events and a holiday party which makes me feel like I am a part of a community.

If you are looking for a beautiful, luxury apartment in prime Downtown LA with friendly staff, look no further!</review>< gmapID>

<review>Pegasus is an awesome place to live if you want to be in the heart of the city, with 24 hour security, and great amenities. The staff is super friendly and very helpful, which is a huge deal when it comes to moving in, deliveries, guests, lock outs, etc. There are a range of unit layouts and sizes as well, so I imagine there is something for every lifestyle. I love my studio and get tons of natural light (even facing inwards) and have a surprising amount of closet space. The walls must be thick, too because I have never heard my neighbors in any direction or been told to keep it down even on the few nights I had guests late a night. The pool and gym speak for themselves, but there is also a ton to do (and eat) walking distance or via metro. I highly recommend this place!</review>< pics>

An apartment community is only as good as the staff that operates it. Dee and the rest of the team at Pegasus have been more than gracious. From the initial showing and application process, Dee and team have been responsive and more than accomodating. I am very happy with my decision to lease here. I would, without a doubt, recommend Pegasus. If you come by for a showing, make sure you ask for Dee.<//review>

<review>Ms. Dee Brown and Mr. Macy Mansion were exceptional in the leasing experience. They were very committed to ensuring that it was a smooth process. I would recommend the Pegasus Apartments to any one who is searching for a great living experience in Downtown Los Angeles. Again, I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to Ms. Brown and Mr. Mansion for their beyond the call of duty in the areas of professionalism and generosity.<//review>< time>

The leasing staff are Grade A! Whether it's Dee, Macy, or Alex they are professional and fun. I know if I need something, I can count on them to assist me. I find myself chatting with them regularly and appreciate all that they do for the Pegasus community!< /review>< Pictures>

I moved to LA in August. I picked Pegasus because its proximity to the metro would allow me to avoid driving to work. The lease team took care of my application in a timely manner so I didn't have to stay in a hotel longer than I had planned. Everything has been perfect so far. The staff and building are both top notch. There are no maintenance issues and no obnoxious neighbors. Pegasus is also close to everything in DTLA.< /review>

<review>Been living at Pegasus for around 6 months now, and I cannot recommend the facility and staff enough. From the concierge service to the staff at the leasing office, every person at Pegasus consistently over-performs. Macy and Dee, particularly, are constantly helpful whenever help is required. They've quickly resolved any issue I've had, and they are a pleasure to talk to. Again, can't recommend them enough.<//review>< rate>

I’ve lived at the Pegasus for over two years now and they have been nothing but kind and incredibly helpful whenever needed. They’re great at notifying me when I’ve received a package as well as when there is an event or a road closure taking place in the area.

I’ve lived in a studio as well as a two bedroom, two bath and have nothing but positive things to say about both of them. The two bedroom had phenomenal natural lighting and was extremely spacious, even with three people living there. The studio was newly renovated and in perfect condition upon moving in!

My experience at the Pegasus has definitely been a positive one. Great apartments and a great staff, there’s always a friendly face to brighten your day!< /text>

Just moved in today, getting all the final details ready. I just had to say a few warm words for property agents, Alex and Dee. They made my transition into the property simple and smooth, were extremely patient with me, and went further than I thought they would to help me out.

Thank you,< /Review>

Thankfully, my one year lease has finally come to an end. When I first moved in, my roommate and I had issues with water temperature, light fixtures, a broken in-unit washer, and terrible noise from the trash truck very early in the morning almost every day. When you inform the property managers of any issue they always become defensive and attempt to place the blame on the tenant. Often they appeal to their "experience" with these issues or they simply argue that because Equity Residential is a publicly traded company that they, somehow, know more than you about your own situation. To top this off, the property managers/leasing office will do anything to charge you an additional hidden fee. For example, when you give notice to evacuate the property after your lease has terminated, the leasing office posts a note on your door which states, "ESTIMATED CHARGES DUE AT OR PRIOR TO MOVE-OUT," (original emphasis) and the charges include: prorated rent, utilities, miscellaneous charges, parking, etc. Naturally, it seems that you should be allowed to pay this all "at or prior to move-out." Of course, if you follow these directions, you will be charged a hefty late fee because in actuality, you have to pay on the first of the month. While the leasing office is technically not wrong in stating that we had to pay on the date that we agreed to in our lease, they try to obscure any contractual obligations by providing the tenants with conflicting information to force the tenants to pay a late fee because of technicalities. This is simply a telling example of how this building is managed.

I highly recommend not living at the Pegasus and looking elsewhere. This building is managed by a slimy leasing office that really only cares about making money off the tenants.</text>

Building has 8 elevator banks. When I moved in at the beginning of the year only three were working but that seemed fine, rarely waited. Another one broke about a month ago and thats when the waiting started. Over the weekend another broke and now there is only one elevator for a building with hundreds of apartment units. Can take upwards of 5 mins to wait for elevator to come only for it to be packed full of people stopping at every single floor and have to wait for the next. Considering one broke a month ago and wasn't fixed doesn't seem like management cares. Literally walked down 10 flights of stairs to go get dinner tonight.<//text>

<Review>I really enjoy living at Pegasus and have been a tenant for the past five years. What makes this place so special is the front desk. Abe, Amal and Roger are exceptional. From Amal holding the front door open for tenants after a long day at work or school and greeting them by name. Abe, always smiling, saying good morning and ready to assist with even the smallest of problems to Roger on the weekends, who is always pleasant and willing to do whatever he can to make the weekend problem free, they are what makes living at Pegasus as close as possible to an experience of being at “home”.  I thank all of them for doing their job so well and also management for identifying and hiring such pleasant and professional people as they are what makes living here so nice. I want to add to the review that the Pegasus front desk is getting much better than it even was when I first moved here. The weekend front desk clerk Roger Pedro is always at his station and always reminding me if a package is waiting. I hope management is aware of the fine job he does every weekend.< /Review>< Name>

I am beyond happy that I no longer live in this building. The property management team is abysmal. They are extremely condescending if you are under the age of 30. And never seem to be in the office when you need them.

Do not live here or in an Equity Residential property by any means.</text>

<Name>Rana Al-Jiboury</Name><Review>***I WANT TO SHOUTOUT KEN Z. THE MANAGER FOR THE WONDERFUL Maintenance TEAM—HE IS SOOOO KIND, PROFESSIONAL & ATTENTIVE, he came on shortly after I moved in and has exceeded all my expectations—u don’t realize how much better your living experience is when you have a amazing maintenance team to help. The building not just my apartment is always clean & beautiful, when ppl visit they are always impressed. SHOUTOUT AND BIG THANKS TO KEN TOO***

So let me tell you my experience at Pegasus beginning with leasing—I have been a equity residential resident for some time and I needed to move to downtown for my job I looked everywhere for apartments and then finally decided to come back to the equity family although I did not have a great experience at my last equity apartment I decided to give their apartments one more try I ended up finding the Pegasus last minute before I needed to move and I met a wonderful gentleman named MACY who made everything so seamless and quick for someone who is moving in last minute, He helped me move in a day early from when the apartment was even going to be ready and the apartment was ready and beautiful and I’m sure that was due to his wonderful coordination and the other wonderful staff at Pegasus. The process could have been much longer and less seamless but due to Macy and with the help of Dee the other sales agent I was able to move in on time. I thank all of them but especially Macy for his hard work in getting me this home I have enjoyed living at Pegasus I have had no problems or complaints with neighbors or the team,  they always come fast when I have a maintenance request and due to my wonderful experience every time I go down to the office I need a package or anything Macy and others are there to assist me I really miss the service of one guy that worked here his name was Amal, and he was also wonderful always opening the door for anyone that was coming in & greeting them. Pegasus due to especially Macy, and of course Dee & all the others it has felt like home. Thanks Macy & Pegasus team ;). Ask for Macy or Dee! and I don’t want to forget Alec and Abe and Avery and Roger as well— they have always been helpful and kind. I hope I’m not forgetting anyone, Wonderful job to the whole team!! Thanks again <3</Review></record></dataset><record>

Great pool area and staff are friendly. Construction on the Flower St. side goes on all night and is almost unbearable without sound proofed windows. They’re building a subway so it’s set to go on until 2022. Parking is about $180 p/m.<//review>

<text>As much as I so far enjoy the building, could not have had a more disjointed move-in process.  Leasing requires you to rent out the loading dock / freight elevator, which is normal, but when our movers arrived a contractor was using the loading dock to remove all the replaced toilets from the building (which is weird, as we had the reservation right?).  So instead of the loading dock, we parked in the alley and our movers had to take all of our stuff up a small flight of stairs, which led to some of our belongings being damaged with the extra handling.

Then, the freight elevator has been broken for "at least a week", which meant we had to put all of our stuff through the regular lobby and elevators, while coordinating with regular access to the building.

Bottom line is Leasing and actual Building Operations are not on the same page.  3/10.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1449871235686, 'text': 'Hi Matt,\n\nWe apologize for this experience. Unfortunately, the freight elevator was down for a number of days and required specialized parts and techs to get it back up and running.\n\nAs you mentioned, this was also during the same time that we had scheduled to replace the toilets throughout and this area was the only remaining place that the bins could be placed.\n\nAgain, we are very sorry for this inconvenience. If you would like to discuss this in more detail with our community manager, please feel free to contact the offices at 213.430.9112.\n\nThank you.'}<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2c7b3f03fcb27:0x37e998c5a849c5d7<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>My honest and in-depth review of the Pegasus

the Pros
•	Rooftop pool/gym/hangout/BBQ area was one of the best features of Pegasus.
•	All the concierge and leasing agents were extremely helpful throughout our stay anytime we needed help (big ups to Amal, Avery, & Alex. I apologize for missing some other names!)
•	Can’t forget the maintenance guys either, they were always quick and extremely helpful!
•	The apartments are small (that’s just DTLA) but they are nice and set up well (minus the all-in-one washer/Dryer). The AC worked great for somebody that likes to keep it cold in their apartment.
•	Mixer events! I have never stayed anywhere that did this, but these were great, and we did make a few friends that have moved on from the Pegasus that we are still in touch with. Anybody that is not from LA knows how hard it is to make friends and having them in the same apartment as you make it easier to hang out!
•	These guys are pet friendly and extremely welcoming of them. I have found this to not to be common in places that even claim to be pet friendly.
•	Freight elevator is a godsend for moving in/out. This is not common but an amazing feature of this place.

The Cons
•	To start, I had scheduled an apartment walk and show up to see we are double booked (oldest trick in the book to put the sales pressure on). Well it worked because we were blinded by that glorious rooftop pool. We jumped into our apartment before taking a minute to consider other factors. (see below)
•	I will accept partial responsibility for this, but we were never clued in that the apartment we were moving into would have the new metro construction going on around the clock for the next year or so. would have been nice to get a heads up to potentially consider another area of the building.
•	The lighting in these apartments is pathetic even by California apartment standards. 2 terribly dim lights in the kitchen and dining room using some goofy bulb that can’t be swapped out with something better. Normally I wouldn’t write this item down but for an apartment that costs 2500+ dollars for a 1 bedroom I felt it belonged here.
•	The all-in-one washers and dryers got to go. They cannot keep up with people that go to work/gym/outs demand. 1 load can take up to 3 hours from beginning to end and your clothes will still wind up wrinkled. They have on site laundry, but this rant is long enough without diving into that mess. Again, probably not worthy of putting on a con list but I will refer you to my last statement regarding apartment cost.
•	Our neighbors F@*!&#g sucked. This isn’t necessarily the Pegasus’ fault but after a 9+ months of off and on battle over banging a subwoofer loud enough so you cant even carry a conversation in your apartment without hearing (thun,thun,thun) rattle through your head, I can’t help but wish they would have done more with them. (I may be asking a bit much here, but it was the #1 reason we decided to leave).

I am still in the process of dealing with this item, but the deposit charges process has been a mess so-far. A week after my departure I was hit with nearly 900$ in “damages”. I am fully aware that I am not perfect and that there would be deductions, but this has felt excessive. The biggest mistake being that I requested an initial inspection to fix potential “damages”. The inspection was performed but I never received a follow up on these items. This has left me blindsided. I will update this review depending on the outcome. Take pictures, save your emails, and make copies of all paperwork you submit and receive. I am usually on these items but moving is stressful and when you have one day to move out and into a new spot its easy to miss those last critical steps. DO NOT wind up in the same position as me!

Overall, we liked our stay at the Pegasus Apartments. It’s unfortunate that our neighbors and this deposit dispute have left a sour taste in our mouth, but we did enjoy our time here before that started up. We liked living in downtown and would consider living there again in the future with a smarter approach.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Positives: Staff and concierge are very nice and helpful. The building is in a fun location and the apartments are pretty nice. Very cool pool and gym.

Negatives: The NOISE! Whether it's the constant construction on Flower Street that will never end or the USC students who live and party all around you, you will have a lot of trouble sleeping. Multiple middle of the night fire alarms/evacuations...but strangely there was no alarm when there was an ACTUAL FIRE in the building!

The SMELL! Is it a weekend? Well, the garbage chute is just about guaranteed to be blocked up. I've had to leave and stay the night somewhere else due to sewer gas coming into my apartment.

Hot water? Sometimes. You may have to wait 15 minutes for it, which is no bueno when you're paying for water.

I understand that these are things that will happen in a Downtown apartment, but I cannot bring myself to pay $2,600+ per month for a 4th floor 1BR where all of this nonsense happens.< /Review>< Pictures>

Where should I start? Robert, Pegasus & Associates are total morons who have no respect for your time. We sent a request for Homeowner association documents  including Fedex labels etc and we have yet to receive the documents. I wish I did not have to deal with him but he is the HOA Manager and all documents must come from him and you have to sit and wait. When we called to request status, he stated to be patient and hanged up the phone. If you are an Condo/Townhouse community, DON'T work with this company. If you are looking for property manager, don't be fooled by any reference to use this guy and company as their are plenty of Property Managers with A+ service who will answer your calls and provide you the service with gratitude unlike Robert Heiman and Pegasus Propertie< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The minimum contract age is one year.
Making an apartment is really good,
I can't hear any noise.
Residents can use the pool on the roof for free.
The view from here is very nice.
This may be a fate of downtown,
Free tenants on the ground floor are still looking bad.

(Original)
最低契約年数は1年。
アパートの作りはものすごくよくて、
騒音なども一切聞こえません。
屋上にあるプールなどは住民は無料で使えます。
ここから見る景色は非常にいいです。
これはダウンタウンの宿命かもしれませんが、
地上階の空きテナントがやはり見栄えを悪くしています。<//text>

This place is always good and friendly staff. I have never had any bad experiences. Always my go to for good food, the best artichoke dip, and I don't mind the drinks at all. Always yummy 😋< /Review>

The server Jared was awesome and friendly!  However, Jackie the hostess is rude.  We asked for a menu and she rolled her eyes.  We waved to her to ask for salt and pepper and she waved back and did not come over.   We had to walk over to her for assistance.  Furthermore, when she was cleaning a table she dropped stuff on the floor, looked at it an walked away.  If she is in charge of sanitation, I am worried.  Her customer service skills and work ethic sucks!<//Text>

I came in with my daughter, sat at the bar and the bartender acted as though we were BOTHERING HIM when she ordered a Kids Meal. He made sure to ask the other Latino patrons if THEY needed anything else but barely spoke to us. I chalked it up to possibly there was language issue and let it go. But when I was ready to pay, he looked at me and continued putting away glasses that he brought in from the kitchen, as though my time wasn't valuable! I left a 10% tip and was almost ready to leave a PENNY but decided he did serve us so he should receive SOMETHING! HOPEFULLY, Management will see this and make sure no one else feels slighted when they are spending their hard earned dollars at their establishment.</Text>

Pretty good food and decent happy hour frozen margaritas. If you limit yourself to one drink and one appetizer, you can get out for 10-12 $ per person. We were happy .<//review>

<Text>My husband and I decided to Doordash Applebee’s for my birthday tonight. The dasher delivered our food while I was assisting my oldest with her homework. When my husband and I started sorting the meals I noticed that there were items missing from all the meals. I attempted to call the dasher to ask if there was an extra bag or ask if there were issues with the order. The Dasher kept forwarding me to voicemail. Here’s the reason I’m giving this location 5 stars. I called to explain what happened and Micah, the manager apologized and gave me a few options. I told him I would go pick up the missing items myself but he said that since it was my birthday he would personally deliver them and include dessert. I let him know that that wasn’t necessary and I could pick them up but he insisted. He not only brought the missing items but he included 2 desserts and ice cream. He truly made mine and my husbands night for going above and beyond his job duties. Thank you Micah, you’re amazing!!!<//Text>< pictures>

Applebee's in downtown Riverside is the spot for a quick, budget friendly night out to eat. Even during these times, they made a great patio area to still enjoy a "dine-in" experience. If I was you, I'd request to sit with Kison. He is the best server I've even seen. He doesn't need to write anything down and it still comes out flawless even with our modifications. Attentive and funny guy, we will be back and requesting him!</Text>

<Text>First off our server was great. The manager was sweet and kind. The food.. ick appetizers looked and tasted freezer burnt then fried.  My shrimp Alfredo was under cooked..the noodles were gross. After a second time bringing it i just ate shrimp.  My drinks were an average 10 to 15 min wait between for my cocktail refill. Mind you it wasn't busy at ALL. Bartender was to busy talking with his mask down or half off the whole time. I asked a manager for my drink after watching the Bartender for a while mask pulled down making small talk while standing around. 1 minute her going back there my drink was made.  Our visit was because we had a long day and was sooo hungry.  We left more tired and irritated than anything. Oh and I grabbed Del Taco  because I was fricking hungry.. should have gone there first!< /Text>< response>

Food and drinks were delish. We ate in the tent. It was bit cold for me, and no heaters were provided. Also, it would have been nice to have music.<//Review>

The food was good but the brownie ice cream was really good. The brownie was like lava cake that is my favorite triple chocolate cake.
We tried two for 27 deal. It was the two main courses and one appetizer (we choose onion rings). The price with the deal was good.</text>

Very bad experience with this restaurant, very disappointed. First off, Jessica, the hostess that takes phone orders put me on hold for 15 minutes when I was calling trying to place an order for pick up when I was driving there so I hung up & called back & asked to speak to a manager & then she just put me back on hold so by then I was already at the restaurant so I went inside to place my order & Jessica was the one supposed to take my order but she was too busy & had us just standing there & told us she would be right with us & then she went to go get some to go orders ready so I had to ask someone else if they could take our order & they said Jessica was supposed to. Once we got our food it was two very small entrees. Won’t be visiting this place again. Very disappointing with the service & quality of our food!< /Text>

<review>They have set up tables in the back for outdoor dining. We went there for lunch on Friday. Service was good, our waitress was friendly and  efficient. However, I was disappointed that their lunch bowls are not currently available. I was really looking forward to having one of those, their so good! All in all it was a good experience in the midst of these crazy times.</review>< pictures>

I ordered curbside and was late (my fault). Once I got there used the app to say so but then had to wait like 15 more minutes. My food was cold (again, ill take the blame for being 15 minutes late) but not sure why it took so long to get cold food. 15 minutes was a long time for something that was already done. I like the food but next time I'll just go in and order.< /Text>

<Review>Jacob was our server and was very attentive and gave friendly speedy service since we told him we had a movie to go too. He was so wonderful and kind. He recommended great food choices and drink beverages. He works well under pressure for being a busy Saturday night. I look forward to visiting this establishment again because he made our date night experience enjoyable.

They don’t sell their cocktails to go without buying food and they don’t even put it on their website. What a waste of time to place the order and go.<//Review>

Difficult to get order placed on the phone. We were given a 30-35 minute window for pickup, they were running 25 minutes behind. They shorted us an order of fries, coleslaw and got the salad wrong! Won't be going back!<//Review>

Best AB'!!
During this pandemic, I've been ordering there a lot, and the manager is doing an A1 (excellent) job!! Its a tough time. But it's nice to be able to still order out!! They are being extra careful to make sure all orders are correct and that everything is to your liking!!

Servers are sometimes rude, half are awesome the other half need more training. The bartender runs out of glasses and asks for help but most are too busy talking. They close earlier than other applebees so it's hard to enjoy happy hour.<//review>

<time>1582077898469< /time><review>I like coming here for happy hour. Long Island iced tea for under $5? Yes, please! For the most part, the food is ok, but there  are a few items that I really enjoy: the chicken or brisket quesadillas are delicious, boneless hot wings are good, and the top sirloin from the 2 for $22 special was surprisingly awesome. The employees are very friendly and nice to talk to and the bathrooms are always clean. My daughter gives this place 10 stars. Mac n cheese and those Presto machines to play games on are all she needs.< /review>< Gmap_id>

I went there with two friends. The servers were quick and friendly. The waitress calmly explained one of the food deals and it worked. She fetched mayo and sour cream when my friend wanted them for her broccoli. 😝 We took a long time ordering and eating, and the waitress seemed fine with it. We had Cajun salmon, shrimp, and broiled chicken, All was good except I did not think the Cajun fish was very cajuny.</text>

They cooked all items with butter in a pan for me. I can't give it 5 stars as my husband wasn't overly happy with his meal, but it was acceptable enough for Applebee's.</review>< pics>

< review>
The Rubidoux High School Football team had their 2nd annual all-you-can-eat pancake breakfast here yesterday Saturday May 27. Can't believe i forgot his name, but we had one waiter help us out sooo much i really hope he was paid overtime because he really did work his butt off to help us. He was bringing us the trays of food, so we could serve the plates and the football players take them to the tables. Also, thanks to the manager Frankie and the cook or cooks who we didn't get to meet, but were cooking non-stop for over 2 hours, when i say non-stop i mean the waiter would bring us out 1 or 2 full trays  of food and when he did we would need 2 more..that's how it went for a while. So, thank you all at Applebee's so much!! Hope to see you next year!<//review>

I have been here several times. It is always busy. I have tried a few meals and all were
delicious and large portions. Price is reasonable. Management and staff have been very pleasant and accommodating.  I am definitely returning as often as possible.</review>

<Text>The staff is really cool and the environment is like a chill bar and grill family restaurant fusion. I don't appreciate the 8 oz steak being as expensive as it is and not coming with enough sides to make up for the size of the steak and the rest of the meal. Other than that they have a few deals they do with alcoholic beverages and different specials that make the visit with it. Other than my own personal ideals it's a cool spot that's close to downtown and the train station if you're visiting or want to introduce yourself to the downtown area. I wouldn't say I'm a regular but I have been through enough to have a pretty good idea what it's like.</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dcb1e43066b471:0x410d49748fe4d47d</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Clean restaurant not over crowded, staff was very helpful and courteous considering we were a large party. Even with a large party the wait for a section wasn't long (less than 15 minutes). The food was good no problems with the orders the drinks were great considering they're only a $1. Had a great time with the family</Text>

Good place to grab a bite. Nothing special but you know what you get. Service can be slow depending on the time.< /review>

<Text>Food was good when we finally got it...appetizers came AFTER dinner, classic bacon burger requested without cheese came with cheese and got charged for bacon added, asked for chips and salsa before dinner and waiter thought he was doing us a favor switching it to spinach dip and chips supposedly with salsa on the side but they didn't make it to the table before our dinner did so it was more dessert than an appetizer, I ordered the wonton tacos which used to come in little taco stand holders that kept them from getting soggy- tonight they came laying on a plate soaking up all the liquid from the cabbage/slaw dressing... Not a good experience.<//Text>< pictures>

The service was fast & decent. The food tasted good. My complaint is that I was served Luke warm French onion soup & given a plastic spoon to eat it with. I was told by the waiter If I wanted to wait I could have a real spoon as soon as they were all washed . Also we had ice cold air hitting our table I mean really cold air, & I love air conditioning but this made our food ice cold immediately. I will go back again but I will ask to sit away from the air.<//review>

Really good food. I'm a vegan so I ordered the Oriental salad and just didn't eat the chicken. Delicious salad but not many vegan options. We had a great server so it made the evening very nice.</Text>

I have never got bad service from this restaurant.   Even when crowded they are great and fast. Lunch time is the best time when I go.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I ordered the all you can eat appetizer "Riblets"...  A two fold Problem... First and the Worst was that all three times I wax Served My food came out to me COLD...  Luke Warm at best.... Second the Cook did not take the time to flatten the ribs, half of them came out folded like the were frozen that way and or came out of a pre portioned vacume sealed bag...
Any way because they were Folded the meat was not Grilled/ cooked all the way because the meat was not totally exposed to the Fire... (No Grill Marks) with in the folded area's... Lastly my Fries were also served COLD... Discussing...!!! Greg</Review><date>1579314717930</date>< username>

<review>Great perfect margaritas going on right now. The food is always plenty to fill u up and the flavors are far from bland. Staff is prompt and food delivery is also pretty timely. They stay open later then most places n have plenty of parking. I go here for lunch with coworkers and with my boyfriend. The specials have good selections and priced at a awsome affordable range. They have differnet 1 dollar mixed drink specials during happy hour daily.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>The restaurant itself was great the bathrooms were horrible. It looks like the staff is the ones cleaning the bathroom and you're not doing a very good job. Every time I go to this restaurant I see the same condition with the bathrooms they don't wipe down the Walls they don't clean the floors properly.< /review><gmap_id>0x80dcb1e43066b471:0x410d49748fe4d47d< /gmap_id>< user_name>

They did not have ribs not sure why. A brisket was ordered instead it arrived very cold and dry which was a surprise. We quickly called the server over to inform them and she removed it and apologize for it. She brought another over which was hot and fresh. Despite their efforts it turned out to be a disappointing experience.</review>< pics>

It started when I ordered a Pepsi and received a water only. I ordered a salad with out onions...when the salad came out it had onions all over it. Also wasn't trying to stay here all night. Server is taking a very long time to do simple tasks like bring the bill! Complete bad experience tonight!< /text>

<rate>1< /rate><text>Came for happy hour, I asked about the GC promo and it wasn’t offered to me and I asked as I was paying and I was told by joe it’s when I cash out. Hmm, guess what I was paying. Shady from ABs part. I let Joe know that I wish he would have told me that it wasn’t part of happy hour and he tells me it was. I was told a beer during happy hour was only a dollar off. The beer is expensive even during happy hour. Long islands are cheaper and when I told Joe his words words were “they are expensive” on point...thank you will be my response.<//text><resp>None<//resp><name>ivan guevara</name>< userid>

Bad cooks in the back. They need to learn how to get the food cooked correctly. The Apple Bees off of the 15fwy and Limonite is the best. Service was great though. Back of the house need major attention. I'll raise my star level from 1 to 2. They comped us both meals. Thank you server and manager.

Now it's Jan 16th 2019. Back here again. I must say I am impressed with pur service this time and the back of the house. Food came out correctly and on time. Servers, all of them, were great and friendly. It almost seems like they knew who I was and they redeemed themselves. We will be coming back. This time I give this Applebees a 4 star. This one and the Limonite are contenders in customer service. Andrew was our main server. Let me say Thank you Andrew. And to the Manager, José. Thank you.</Review>

Struggling to understand why it takes so long to get seated when there are open tables everywhere. Employees were friendly however seemed like they needed better management/training in a bad way. Food took forever to arrive at the table.< /Text>

Service was great, the staff was friendly and informative.  However when I got my order and opened it at home, I was missing my breadsticks and the side of ranch I requested for my mozzarella sticks.  I ordered online and everything seemed to clearly laid out in the online order form.  Not sure where the miscommunication was.  Double check your order before you leave when you order take out! Food as always was delicious</review>

This was my second visit to Applebees. The  first visit was a lack luster and bland food experience.  This second visit, was a family birthday dinner.  I ordered the grilled salmon. There was 10 people in our party and everyone ordered various items. My order, the salmon came in 10 minutes after everyone else's. When it finally comes it was dry and tasteless! Won't be returning anytime soon!< /Text>

Five starts for our server Shakira (spelt a bit wrong) she was perfect. Bonds with her guests and keeps the mood good even when there's other associates that don't know how to treat them. The host was very rude and took time to serve our food in a very rude and sarcastic way and caught many time giving dirty looks all because she didn't like us asking about a specific table. When we tried to talk to the manager he didn't seem to care or even try to fix the situation. The only one who's was sincere and tried to fix the situation was Shakira.<//text>

Food was great, server disappeared and we waited about 30 minutes for drink refills and another 25 for our check. The place was not busy, so I don't understand where she went.< /Text>

<review>I'm perplexed by the amount of people waiting to get into here to eat. It took just over 20 minutes to get water to our table. The person who waited our table was a robot and remembered six people orders perfectly. Between the Bar & Kitchen and packed dining room there was confusion of staff. I had to ask for a check as well, proof of just how overworked employees are there. The food is decent certainly not worth waiting to be sat at a table for it. Mainstream media advertisement I believe got into people's heads because there's much better food in the surrounding area.< /review><user>108984396293214607900</user><time>1501459764327< /time><response>None< /response><user_name>Scott Palmer<//user_name></record>

Here's a rare phenomenon, an Applebee's that DOESN'T suck.

The food was actually good, and the service was prompt, friendly, and competent.

This was probably the only good Applebee's I've ever been to, all the other ones I've eaten at suck.  There's no excuse for that.

If you want a good Applebee's amd happen to be in the area, eat here.<//Text>

Don't fret if it's busy, it is worth the wait. The service was sociable and attentive. Bring your hunger - portions are large. Kinda of like a place in Houston that I enjoyed.< /Text>

We just finished eating dinner and my wife and my son shared a spinach dip within 45 minutes both of them were vomiting and had diarrhea I called the store manager to speak to her and she didn't even ask my name or a callback number The only thing she stated was that they would look into it. Very disappointing you would think that a manager would care more about food safety</text>

Went yesterday to celebrate my son's birthday.
Was a little crowded.  Very unhappy with our server, did not check back with us to get refills on our drinks, had to ask another server for additional napkins  and boxes to take home food.
Not happy with service.</text>

<user_id>100889915057081768344<//user_id><Review>The ordering process is so messed up...I telephoned Riverside the computer answers, then there is an error so it puts me on with a team member. I tell them my order. I drive to the Riverside location: they know nothing about the order. Then they have to take my order in person not once...but twice and walk it to the kitchen to get it going. 30 some minutes later after sitting in the car I get my order. I drive home and about an hour after ordering the Fontana location calls me and asks "when are you going to pickup?" I never called Fontana, I called Riverside and the computer said thanks for calling ... Riverside.
I'm now waiting to see if their Anaheim location calls next because I have ordered from there also in the past.

POS  is supposed to mean Point of Sale but in this case it means the other thing...P.O.S.<//Review>< date>

<review>Restaurant was busy and tables were full, but was VERY cold. Our party of 3 couldn't take our jackets off. Mentioned to the wait staff several times and were told the air had been turned off.

We went out for a family dinner here. They said rhe wait would be 25 minutes . There were at least 6 open tables which we could see when we went in. They didnt even begin to seat people for 20 minutes. The 3 young people at the hostess counter were chit chatting and laughing most of the time. People before us were getting irritated at not being seated with so many open tables. I noticed a lady and her son who were ready to order but no waitress came for 20 minutes. We waited for over 30 minutes and finally got up and left. Also, when they finally seated people it was at some of the tables that had been empty the whole time.
We went down the street and got great service at the old spaghetti factory.<//review>

Small location ... feels a little cramped inside.  If you have a stroller best leave it in the car.  Food is good though and their service is generally great.< /Text>

<Review>Food was okay, nothing special. Service was horrible! It wasn't a busy night, yet the server managed to get our order wrong, charged us for that wrong order he placed, and couldn't manage to get us the simplest thing, a fork. He knew he had messed up, but didn't know how to address the issue. He was very, very awkward! Overall, the food wasn't nasty but it wasn't great either. Wouldn't recommend. I'll rather go eat at Bravos California fresh in Moreno Valley!</Review>< pics>

<review>My family enjoyed eating at Applebee's. The service and food was always good. We just ate at the restaurant located in Norwalk CA and the food was horrible. The old menu was much better. The quality of food served was very poor. Probably won't eat at Applebee's again. Waste of money.</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

We have eaten here several times.  The food is good, but sometimes it can take awhile to get your order, even if the place is empty.  The parking lot is also frequently full, even if there doesn't appear to be that many people in the restaurant.< /review>

< Review>
We frequent Applebees at least once a week. We came to this location to meet our son and granddaughter for lunch because it's closer to his house.
The waiting area benches were missing a cushion so the Velcro on the exposed bench was full of hair and food crumbs.
Yuck.
We always get cheese sticks and the pub pretzels with the beer cheese dip.
Bummer. The pretzels had enough salt to qualify as a lick and the dip was enough for 2 pretzels, not 4.
The hubbs and I ordered the same thing, medium steak. When the meal came everyone got their food except for me. Unfortunately our server didn't put the order in for two steaks. When I did get my meal 15 minutes later it was a plate of blood, barely cooked steak.
So, I have to say we weren't exactly pleased with any of it. My granddaughters corn dog was burnt as well. They seemed to need the table so I just had my meal put in a box because everyone else was done eating.
It was just so disappointing.
My cats enjoyed the steak I brought home.
Will we eat at Applebee's again?
Probably so. This location?
No.</Review>

<Text>Umm.. well let me start off by saying the waitress and manager were AMAZING. But unfortunately, i ordered the chicken tender kids meal for my daughter and the chicken tender was so well done that she choked on it until she turned red and started drooling. It Literally took years off my life seeing her struggle to catch her breath. So for that reason i had to give it 3 stars instead if the 5 stars.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcb1e43066b471:0x410d49748fe4d47d</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Most of the time it's great' but this early evening was not so good. We sat at the bar, bartenders forgot our order as they were to busy and had to wait to long to get served! And it kept repeating for the rest of Our visit!</Review>

<Date>1469561765252<//Date><Rate>3< /Rate><review>We normally enjoy it here. But last night there were drunk, loud and obnoxious ladies in the bar area. We didn't complain, but they noticed us covering our ears so they started to make rude references towards us. The waiter asked if we would like the manager to intervene, but we knew that would make it worse. We hurried our desserts and left. As we were leaving, the drunks started cheering. Again, we didn't even complain, just covered our ears when it became ridiculous. Sad that some can't behave properly in public.</review>< pics>

They gave my 3rd grade Daughter a free milk shake at Her school. We went and I got a shake also. Mine was drinkable but her was the sorriest excuse for a milk shake I had ever tasted. I won't go back< /Review>

<review>Applebee's Grill & Bar was a super good experience. Atmosphere and service was an A-Plus, with the waiter being very knowledgeable of the menu and Advising best choices. With a Party of Five we had an abundance of food for under $80 that was well worth it. If all Applebee's are like this one I recommend them to everyone.</review>< pics>

Portion size not that great and I had to send my food back multiple times after just not ordering. I had the grilled shrimp and grilled chicken meal with honey bbq. The bbq wasn't even real honey bbq they told me it was and I know they lied about that. I dont think I'll come back again.Went for my gf's bday, the server was at least accommodating.< /review>

Slightly better than the last visit but still desperation eating. Applebee's is more interested in getting its 10 to $20 per person out of you than serving up good food. The primary spice is salt. Most things arrived cold. Booths are cramped for more than two people.</Review>

Applebees Grill is a large, clean facility with good service. This is the first time I've been to an Applebees in several years and in spite of the appealing facility, I personally do not find their food selections appealing to a more health conscious palette. For example, we ate here with a friend of ours who has ciliac disease and were surprised they didn't have a gluten free menu or at least readily accessible gluten free suggestions. I can't recommend this restaurant.<//Text>

Staff was very friendly but tge only thing that kinda sucked was that they sat us by the windows right where th AC was blowing and me and my wife were freezing and when they brought our food it was really nice and hot snd withing a few minutes our food got really cold really fast oh and i forgot to mention it was a cold rainy that day too. Will be coming back but ill just ask to be seated else where because i do enjoy Applebees<//Text>

<Text>This was one of the poorest Applebee's I have visited.  As usually it was very busy and we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  The waiter was nice, but the food was not the best.  It was 6 PM on Friday and They had no rib baskets nor did they have any baked potatoes.  I would probably not return to this Applebee's in Riverside CA.</Text><user>115644284613536819713< /user><Resp>None</Resp><Date>1462763860925</Date><gmap_id>0x80dcb1e43066b471:0x410d49748fe4d47d< /gmap_id>< Pictures>

Everytime me and my family sit on the outer sides of the restaurant it's always freezing cold. Each time that happens we tell the management and they do nothing about it. They always have the same story : I'll see what I can do. It completely ruins the experience when your food goes cold in less than 5 minutes!< /Text>

<review>I stopped going to Applebees. Had to. Esp here in Highland. Kept getting recycled food on my plate. Ew. Went to the one on Redlands Blvd a few years ago. It was ok. Now after a few years i went to this location in Riverside with a friend. It was Quite Good! The food was fresh & tasty! The wine & cocktails were good. I'm happy! Looks like I can add Applebees to my list again. Bout darn time. Good job guys!< /review>< pictures>

Only because you can trade this one zero Stars last night was the most horrible experience we have ever had at a restaurant when we got there we had to wait 10 minutes for even somebody to acknowledge us then they satis down we waited another 15 minutes to get our water 25 minutes later we ordered our food 45 minutes later we received our salads after being there for over an hour they brought out our food my boyfriend's food was perfect mine of course completely wrong and not very well displayed the manager was more interested in sitting at the table with her boyfriend then what was going on and there was two waitresses working the entire restaurant never going back to this Applebee's< /Text>

<Rate>2</Rate><review>This was one of the poorest Applebee's I have visited.  As usually it was very busy and we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  The waiter was nice, but the food was not the best.  It was 6 PM on Friday and They had no rib baskets nor did they have any baked potatoes.  I would probably not return to this Applebee's in Riverside CA.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dcb1e43066b471:0x410d49748fe4d47d<//gmapID></record>

Went to the one on Redlands Blvd a few years ago. It was ok. Now after a few years i went to this location in Riverside with a friend. It was Quite Good! The food was fresh & tasty! The wine & cocktails were good. I'm happy! Looks like I can add Applebees to my list again. Bout darn time. Good job guys!<//review>< Pics>

<Review>I was served my modestly priced dinner on a dirty plate with cold broccoli and steak last time I ate here... I only went because someone gave me a gift card. This is a place that I call a burger and fries joint, meaning you can't really expect a lot, so get a burger and fries. Otherwise expect overly salty entrées. This is an opinion I formed long ago, but once and a while I find myself here giving it another honest shot. Maybe my next visit will be better than the last... 8 over the course of 20 years.</Review><user>103149477910988498561</user>< Rate>

First and foremost I want to start with I am a frequent Applebee’s customer. For the most part, I usually always have a great experience at the Moreno Valley Location great food, great service, and amazing atmosphere. My fellow coworkers and I often visit with a group of 20 or more and I have nothing but praise for that location.
I recently visited the Riverside location with a group of 6 adults and a toddler, because we wanted to switch it up a little bit, and how I wish I hadn’t. Firstly when appetizers got to our table (after a long wait) they were cold; we ordered a trio platter, with an additional spinach dip and boneless wings. However, the group did not want to fuss over it. Secondly, when dinners arrived, I ordered a Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp sizzling plate. I want to say it tasted amazing and juicy like it always does in the Moreno Valley location but it wasn’t even close. The potatoes were white, like recently cut barely cooked; cold and white. Another guest in my party ordered a Steak dinner, firstly her sides were wrong she requested potatoes and was brought vegetables, secondly she ordered her steak well done and it was brought at least medium well. We asked to get it fixed and the manager was brought to our table (she did not have a name tag). The manager could have just taken the steak back and cooked it through; however, she instead blamed the lighting at our table. There was other steaks ordered our table and there was more pink in our supposed “Well Done” steak then in our medium well steaks. She didn’t take the steak back until about ten minutes later. We didn’t want that experience to ruin our visit so we try to just stick out and maintain a positive attitude, but visit got worse. Our plates were finally returned, but all our guests had already finished eating.  Service was terrible, food was dry and flavorless. Food was clearly undercooked on the chicken and shrimp and manager noticed that. Worst Applebee’s experience.<//Text>

Every time I've been here for lunch,  I leave feeling underwhelmed. The food is ok,  the service is ok,  the atmosphere is ok, all of it is just ok. It's when you look at your receipt that you realize you are paying premium prices for average food.<//review>

<text>The food was horrible. We had a table of four and out of four only one person food was eatible however he will eat anything. My server was awesome and was tipped 20% but her manager and cooking staff need to rethink there customer care. We order a steak medium well is was over cooked, we asked for cheese on our broccolli they took the food back a microwaved it making the steak even harder. We order a grilled chicken and shrimp dinner that was throw together and cool. like it had been sitting, fell to the floor, threw back on the plate and served.
I asked my server would you want this, she just smiled and naw looks kind of throwed together. Mind you her manager brought it out to me. My other friend ordered a burger that was so pink it could have mooooo.......not to included the manager nochalant attitude. When we asked to speak to her, her first response was my apologizes but do you want your food. Like is that a hint, no I dont want it, what did you do to it? Not included the six rolls of silverware that was cover with spots of its last supper resided. I love apples bee and was so dissappointed I will never go back to this.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

< Review>
I usually go to the applebees in Rancho Cucamonga, but we recently moved so we decided to go for my husbands birthday to this location, Bad choice, We should have just traveled the extra miles to Rancho, The service was terrible, We had to wait 20 minutues just to get a drink from the first time we sat down then another 20 minutes at this point (drinks finished)  just to get appetizers, then another 15min to get drinks again, and it wasn't even busy, the food was good but it took over an hour to get it, We should have just walked out, Very Bad Service and if the Manager does not get it maybe it's time to replace some people, Sadly to say, not all AppleBees are the same, Stay away from this one!!!<//Review>

Order was incorrect and missing items,  server didn't bring us drink refills often and did not check on our status until we were about done with our meal in which at that time we told him to just take the missing items of the check and we no longer were going to wait for them.  Won't be going back to that location.</Text>
