Poor professionalism from the start.  Late in arriving by an hour, didn’t even call ahead.  Walked up to the door talking to someone else on the phone.

Lock was rekeyed fine. However left a huge gouge on my newly painted door.  And Roy I’m not your bro.

Didn’t clean up and left the doors greasy.

Guy that showed up used Hero Locksmith forms.<//text>

My technician came in a timely manner and he was able to rekey my car in no more than 5 minutes.  I paid 348 dollars, which I way way less than what I would have paid at the dealership.  Also if you have an issue with anything, this business is very responsive!  I do appreciate the good service and follow-up.</review>

The locksmith did an excellent job and explained what he had done and the limitation of what he could do as the door was bent.

<Text>Very disappointed! We locked ourselves out of our house! They charged us $200 then instead of him putting the same lock on he told us we had to pay an additional $50, then extra 10% for using a debit card!!!! Horrible how people like this try and get you when you’re in a bind. Take my advice.... shop around!!!!! Don’t waste 210 on poor service! Now we will have to pay another person to install the proper lock ! Oh and he gave us only 1 key.... miserable< /Text>< pictures>

Big thanks to David. Charged  Locksmith Eastbay at a way more competitive value compared to the other smith, suffered my question now, no complications, and found a timely manner. Replaced my broken automobile key inside a 10-20 minutes. Extremely suggested.<//text>

I am very happy and greatful with the service that was provided. I was locked inside of a bathroom for quite a while, trying to get myself out. My partner ended up having to call this service and they were quick to respond and come to my location. The employee was very friendly explained each step that he was going to be doing during the process. Thanks Locksmith Eastbay<//review>

<Review>I lost my car keys a week before. Tried hard to locate it then I gave up. Finally, I called the Locksmith Eastbay. These guys were able to arrive at my place the same day, I called up and build a replacement key with no problem at all. I was expecting I had to wait for a day but they made it happen right away. Thanks a lot.< /Review>< rating>

I accidentally locked myself out. Call & have someone came in about 25 minutes. That's the good part. The bad part is that the guy charged me almost $300 to help me get into my house by breaking the lock & door knob. I mean I can do that myself if I want to use force to get into the house... Now, I need to spend more money to find someone to repair & install the new door knob & lock for me.< /review>

<Review>Great kind people came out same day to change locks and I made the payment online.Technician came out after 6pm same day and honored the price quoted before! Can't say enough great things about this company! You won't be disappointed. I'm sure when I talk to my parents tomorrow they will have more to add.<//Review>< Pictures>

Very poor customer service. They first sent out a guy who did not even know what service he was performing. When he gave me a quote I rejected as it was higher than the dealership even though the dealership's key fob is actually new and not a second hand fob. He got very upset and had a mean attitude. They then sent a different guy who was a lot nicer but failed to CUT the key. He quoted me a price to program and cut it but only programmed it. Would not recommend. Shop around there are better prices and customer service.< /review>

So one the guy said my lock was not pickable, which is a lie and a common grift so that they can just quickly drill your door. But then to replace the $10 cylinder he offered to charge me $120. That’s not the best part. There are two screws that hold the lock in place on a door. HE HAMMERED the lock with a chisel for 20 minutes until he sheered the front screw off of this $700 door mechanism Instead of taking it apart to get the screw out, and then said it was broken before he got there and offered to replace the whole thing with a cheaper mechanism for $1100. Contractor friend came out and bought a new cylinder and a screw and fixed it in about 20 minutes for $30.

Charge ended up being $200 to destroy my door, good job folks</review>

<text>I came back from Phoenix this morning and I couldn’t describe the feeling I felt going through my pockets to find out my car key was gone! Alona from Locksmith East Bay stopped by to create a new key for me at just the right price, when other locksmith companies were gonna charge me an arm and a leg for a replacement. I can now breathe a sigh of relief. I now have my go-to company for all my locksmith needs.< /text>< name>

<Review>John is great!! I highly recommend contacting him for locksmithing services. I lost the key to my car and he arrived right away and was very pleasant to work with. He whipped a new key up for me in no time and it was very reasonably priced. Again, I highly recommend!!</Review>< Pics>

<text>John is great!! I highly recommend contacting him for locksmithing services. I lost the key to my car and he arrived right away and was very pleasant to work with. He whipped a new key up for me in no time and it was very reasonably priced. Again, I highly recommend!!<//text><Rate>5< /Rate><response>None</response>< user_name>

You might just want to train you people a little better. Ben took care of my issue in a very timely matter and he called me to make sure I got my receipt that is why I am now giving this company 5 stars.  Thank you Again.

my daughter and a friend accidentally locked the car key in the truck of the car and the car was also locked called AAA and the tech was not tech savoy with BMW's so they called here got fast service but was incredibly expensive but now it has been over a week and I have called twice to get a receipt to get reimbursed by AAA and for some unknown reason I keep getting the run around they got their money and I just want a flipping receipt from them. Making me think that the tech probably pocketed the money for himself.  One unhappy mommy. NOT SURE WHAT THEIR PROBLEM IS TO GIVE A RECEIPT FOR SERVICES RENDERED.

BEN you did not make a key for them it was a service call for a LOCK OUT no I have not spoken to you this happened to may daughter not me I have called 3 times now and have nicely asked for a proper receipt so that I can submit to AAA but seem to be getting the run around I have given my email address multiple times and what is needed on the receipt for your services and I keep getting the same response that It will be sent to me but I still have not received it.  Tonight I was told that the receipt was mailed and you don't even have my address.  All I am wanting is a proper receipt I don't know what is the problem with that.<//text>< user_id>

He was amazing!! My purse was stolen out of my car with my car keys in it. I was completely stranded with a push to start ignition I couldn’t even move my car. The dealerships quoted me way more and I was going to have to tow my car. These guys came out to my car within 30 mins, reprogrammed a new key for me, ran my debit card on the spot, and got me back in business super quick. He was professional and courteous.</text>

Locksmith East Bay is fabulous; the worker came out within a short amount of time and on the spot, made a key for my vehicle; plus he was finished within minutes. And...the night prior, another worker came within a few hours to change a lock to my home! Hands down great service with a professional mentality!</text>

I was looking for a locksmith to make me a car key, i called a few places but Joe was the first to show up, the price was reasonable and the service was excellent. Hope i won’t need it in the future but if so i'll definitely call Joe again!<//review>

<text>I broke my car key yesterday at a doctors appointment,I had to tape the key to get my car started to make it to the house, Today I called Locksmith East Bay responded in the timely manner their customer service was exemplary, I will most definitely refer them to someone else and their prices are reasonable, I hope you choose them the next time you are locked out of your car or your key breaks.</text>< date>

<Text>Replacement keyfobs this man provided to me, when he got me access to my van after I had lost my original one (which I  eventually found again, which turned out to be very lucky for me) lasted less than a year. Cost less than at a dealer, but I still did not expect that. Only one keyfob from him ever had all of the functions as the original (until it quit working; the original battery in it tested still strong, and putting in a fresh battery just in case my tester was wrong did not help). He pushed me to submit the original typo-filled 5 star version of this review, which he wrote on the spot in his own words and style. That was of course a long time before I knew about the limited durability of the keyfobs from him. Since he wrote that review (I am pretty sure he used his own phone to do that) I did not even know which site he was posting that review to (until I got a message from Google today saying I had "helped" 51 people with it, with a link to "my reviews" of which this was the only one) or I would have replaced that original review with one like this one a long time ago.  But he did have the skills and equipment to get me back on the road in that one visit.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>I've played at this course on and off for the last 7 years. I generally enjoy it because the greens are in good condition, the holes are straightforward (no blind shots), the driving range is all grass, and the food in the cafe is pretty good. Additionally, there are at least 5 sets of tees, which means that there is an appropriate set of tees for players of all skills levels. I also appreciate that the design of the course does not snake all the holes parallel to each other, so aside from a few spots (like between 16 green and 17 tee), there is minimal need to duck from screams of "fore!"

I hesitate to give it a full five stars because of the following: the pace of play at times can be pretty slow even with a good chunk of patrons in carts (usually 5 hours +)...and some of the tee boxes could really use some work (especially #12!).< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Playing here again after a long absence. The landscape & topology of the area contribute to a fun, challenging and attractive course (semiprivate). One of the more notable features are the extra large greens that allow so many different pin placements and forcing u to carefully select the right club (don't forget to factor in the wind, today it was upto 2 clubs) The fairway conditions are better than many public courses but still u will still see occasional browned out bare patches. The tee boxes for the most part are in decent condition. The rough is an adequate length to affect your shots. The extra large greens are in good condition  and in combination with the contours and tiers make chipping & putting an interesting conundrum. A scenic and excellent test of golf.< /Review>

I would like to preface this review by saying I’ve been playing golf for the last 25 years. I’ve played dozens and dozens of courses and feel I have a pretty good gauge on what makes a golfing experience enjoyable. We recently hosted a group outing at Chardonnay Golf Course and we had an outstanding experience. From the ease of organizing this outing with Octavio (he was outstanding to work with) and checking in to carts being set up for us with names labeled on each cart. We had everyone from the single digit handicapper to people who played their very first round of golf on this course that day. Thanks to their kind staff and professional marshal, we were able to introduce the game of golf to people that may have otherwise never played and everyone had a great time. Most people ordered food and were very impressed with the quality. On top of their restaurant being fantastic, they had a food cart on the course on a Tuesday which is amazing in and of itself. The bartender also made great drinks before and after the round. I was very impressed with the quality of the course. Fairways were thick and plush and greens rolled true. It was a very wonderful experience and something we want to do once or twice a year. There’s no doubt we will be returning to the Chardonnay Golf Club as I don’t think their quality for the value can be matched in the bay area.<//Review>

<review>First time here today and it was amazing. Great views, green fairways, sunny, winding in and out of vineyards. Large greens, decent elevation variety; and i even burned 1100 calories walking. Looking forward to going back.</review>< userid>

This is not a very forgiving course as there are a lot of hazards that will send your golf balls to the twilight zone, but no real water hazards.  Mainly wooded areas and lots of vineyards.  Some beautiful downhill par 3's as well.  Even though I probably donated around 9 or 10 golf balls I'd definitely come back when my game gets better.  Food was pretty darn good at their on-site grill as well.  Overall great experience.  Friendly staff, great food and some of the best scenery you could ask for.<//Review><resp>{'time': 1592109982790, 'text': 'Thanks for your review, C!'}</resp><Name>C Castro< /Name>< Gmap_id>

Fun course to play. Club rentals were ok priced at $50. The driving range wasn't open and the snack bar was closed at the turn. The drink cart had pretty good sandwiches. The course was pretty soggy but thats just due to weather in April.</Text>

You have to absolutely blend your bang away skills, with your very keen shot making . a magnificently layed out course and just plain stunning. Bring your” A” game and camera. Keith and entire staff are so accommodating. BOOM!</Text>< pics>

It's a great course. But what's tough with NAPA this time of year is how dry it is. I bet this course is goregous in March, April, may time frame.<//Text>

This course is gorgeous, set amongst the vineyards and rolling hills. The no flag greens make it a bit difficult with all of the hills, but great course and great prices. Will play here often.< /Review>

< review>
Incredible scenery, excellent conditions from tee to green, great deal on Golf Now app...all made for a great afternoon.  Be prepared for all aspects of your game to be challenged!

Tee boxes, fairways, greens, sand traps...all in excellent condition.  While it's a par 72, it has 6 par 5's, 6 par 4's and 6 par 3's - I love it!  I'm all for variation, and you get it at Chardonnay.  The course winds through vineyards and has multiple elevated tees, which give you incredible, panoramic views.  Take several deep breaths, enjoy the view - even on a day when I wasn't at my best I thoroughly enjoyed this course and definitely want another shot at it!

Here are the challenges:
* Greens: At least 14 of the 18 greens can be considered very narrow, so while distance control issues will be slightly tolerated, left/right misses will not!  Most have several tiers, so the threat of a 3 putt is constant if you don't hit the right level.  But they are fair, smooth and quick...just very challenging.
* Fairways: they are rarely straight, and certainly not wide, so they demand accuracy.  So even though the holes aren't really long, meandering fairways present a whole different challenge.  On par 5's the fairways narrow significantly as you approach the greens, forcing you to be extremely accurate with a fairway wood or lay up with a mid iron.  Experience on this course to know the best spots to land and the trouble you can't see from the tee would be very valuable.
* Distance: Choose your tee level carefully.  Yardage is one thing, but narrow distance is another. 18 is certainly a reachable par 5, but most of the others are not for us mortals but very playable with 3 decent shots.  Most courses have one ore two short par 3's to boost your confidence...not here.  They aren't super long, but they are anything but simple.  Par 4's that are 380-410 yards might not seem too long, but when the landing area isn't straight, and the greens are narrow, those holes just got a LOT tougher.

I didn't see a marshall all day, but we played in 4.5 hours so pace wasn't an issue.  Have a great time, enjoy the challenge!< /review>

<Review>Might have just been an off day, but I didn't have a great experience.  The pace of play was unacceptably slow.  The front nine was bad, and the back nine didn't get any better. I bailed after 11 holes when I was the third pairing stacked up waiting for the 12th tee box.  Bummer.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

On October 2017 ago me and my husband  said our I DOs in the Moonlight Grove . This venue offers not only a beautiful and elegant backdrop for your perfect day, but the service is unlike any other. Chardonnay Golf Club was the best decision without hesitation decided it was the one. We had survey Napa and Sonoma area, but Chardonnay Golf Club is The best decision and when we was meeting with Noy as our wedding assistant is very impressive . She has a personality that is calming, sweet and above all wants the best for you. She is such a delight to work with. Melissa, was such a nice person too. We first met Melissa at our food tasting and from then on we loved her. Both these women are there for you. Quick responses always from email or phone and are flexible with anything you need. I truly could not speak more highly about their service but the people they are. One month later From Our wedding, we still receive compliments from friends and relatives and although there were some minor problem on the day, but that was still acceptable.  I'm super satisfied When pick Chardonnay for my wedding. (The ceremony dome, wine barrels, the super gorgeous tent with chandelier and how effortlessly the evening flowed, chairs, glassware, delicious food, table linens, etc) Could not go wrong with hiring Chardonnay Golf Club to help create your dream wedding. We would definitely recommend Chardonnay Golf Club to anyone who is looking for a venue outdoors in the Napa Valley.. Thank you Noy, for a memorable and lovely experience for the best day in my life..</Text>

I’m new to golfing, only my 4th time on a course, and I went out with my boyfriend and a friend and a wonderful associate of theirs. It was chilly and foggy out, and we arrived early so our friends could rent some clubs and we could head to the range out front. We were all warmly greeted and renting clubs was a cinch! The gentleman out front got our carts set up promptly and we were on the range within 5 or so minutes. It took a few holes for the fog to start clearing up but when it did, the view of the vineyards were beautiful! The only downside every once in awhile was that the tee boxes were placed a little wonky; one was on the opposite side of the other three, or we found ourselves dropping me off at one while the other guys went almost out of view to tee off.
The rest of the course was still so fun though! I lost some balls in the vines, we saw tons of geese and even a jack rabbit hopped out to kinda greet us. Facility was clean and upon finishing, we were promptly greeted and taken care of! We will be back!<//Review>

Had a fantastic day of golf at Chardonnay! A beautiful well taken care of course with never ending views. The course was challenging but playable and fun. Great experience all around and one of the most memorable spots I’ve played.< /Text>

Awesome golf course literally surrounded by wine country.  Challenging and picturesque.   Not to mention the drink cart has a built-in margarita dispenser!  Highly recommend this course to anyone looking to golf during a trip to Napa.<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I fell in love with Chardonnay Golf Club after attending a wedding there just after getting engaged. My fiancé and I always imagined getting married in Napa and knew it was the right place after seeing the Moonlight Grove. We narrowed down our venue from a list of 40 because it hit all the key points we were looking for in a venue.

The Moonlight Grove gives you a unique indoor and outdoor feel because you can host your cocktail hour outside, overlooking a gorgeous vineyard and then have your guests enter the tent later in the evening. The location has a number of gorgeous picturesque spots that we were able to take photos at, with the help of Melissa, Noy's assistant.

The staff at Chardonnay was phenomenal. My vendors that knew Noy were so happy to hear that we were working with her and her team. She has a reputation for being easy to work with and on top of her game. We had a South Asian fusion wedding and were looking forward to serving Indian food at our wedding. Unfortunately, it was very expensive to use an outside caterer so we opted to use the in house catering. I think the food ended up turning out even better than if we had used outside catering. Everyone loved the dishes that we picked. Most importantly, we needed to make sure that the food was halal. The chef was able to accommodate our special request with no issue.

In terms of pricing, hosting a Napa wedding can get very expensive. Compared to other similar venues in the Napa area and even further away, Chardonnay had the best  price and value. I am so pleased that we picked Chardonnay. I highly recommend the Moonlight Grove if you are looking for a wedding venue.</text>< pictures>

Myself and 3 friends enjoyed our round there about a week ago. I bid on your generous gift to Lymphoma Leukemia benefit and was the winner. We are a group of guys from Petaluma, about 4 to sometimes 12. that enjoy going to various courses.</review>

They sit side by side on similar, relatively open and nicely undulating terrain, surrounded by vineyards, and not a stick of housing around. Both straddle Fagan Creek and both were originally laid out by Johnny Miller.</Review>< rating>

<Review>Chardonnay Golf Club is one of the most challenging courses to play in Northern California for all skill levels in golf. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful from Head PGA PRO Bob Becker to the Pro Shop staff including administrative staff to the restaurant staff. I chose to make Chardonnay my golf home and joined the club since it really is the best deal you can get for golf in the Napa Valley. I love the course and it is a great place to work on handicapping as well as play in tournaments. The Members Range is great including the Members area where you can work on your game including a private practice green and bunker.
Roger Billings, Director of Golf is who you want to speak with if you are interested in joining this wonderful semi private, non proprietary club. Start your golf membership today at the Chardonnay Club. It is money very well spent if you golf  2 days per week or more.
I love early morning golf since you can see the sunrise to the wild Canadian geese flying around to seeing the mist rise off the ponds of the course while playing in a links  that has characteristics of a Scottish course. You will never be bored here and it will always present you challenge so do manage your game.
Chardonnay Golf Club truly is a gem of the Napa Valley and already I have met many people who come here from all over the world. World Class Wine is not the only offering of the Napa Valley. Golf at the Chardonnay Club is also a World Class Experience and it offers golf and more!<//Review><rating>5</rating>< user_id>

Esteem Cleaners was the fifth cleaners I called on a Friday before 6 who guaranteed cleaning back next day on Saturday before 5.   And I called all the top rated services in the area who I’ve had relationships with for over five years.  Not their fault.  Business is slow during the pandemic. But If you’re in a situation like mine give them a try.  Thank you Conrad!< /text>

< Review>
Found them when I was in my medic academy. They starched my uniforms very well. They're also one of the very few dry cleaners open on a Sunday (Life savers). They're very attentive and quick. Even with being quick, they always do a very thorough job. Always impressed by their work!< /Review>

Esteem Cleaners is the ONLY place we take our clothes. We are always greeted with a smile. The service is great, and our clothing is tailored and/or cleaned always ahead of schedule. I highly recommend this place to anybody.<//review>

Wonderful place! Awesome hours for working adults who need somewhere open later than 7pm!  They did a super job cleaning my son's white shirt, which had been yellow around the neck, they made it look beautiful again! They even found and saved the cuff links my son had left in his shirt pocket. Truly the best service in every way!
Price was also great, around $30 for a full tuxedo (shirt, coat and pants)👍🏻
Thank you guys for an excellent job!!</Text>

They don't post their prices for services anywhere, and they don't really want to tell you how much it costs for their services by just telling you that the price will be on the receipt when you pick it up. (That should have been a red flag to begin with but i was wondering how much could it possibly cost, it's just dry cleaning shirts and pants. I should have asked as well instead of just leaving. Well, to dry clean 2 shirts and a pair of pants came out to $27.45....how on earth does dry cleaning come out to $9.15 a piece of clothing...needless to say I won't be back...If you wear clothing that requires you to consistently go to dry cleaning, I'd find a cheaper spot, like the other reviews also state...<//review>< Pics>

Through the complete fault of my own, I waited until the day of a wedding to actually look at my suit. Six hours before the ceremony I was in complete panic when I realized my suit was a mess.

I literally called 12 dry cleaners in the area and no one could help me! (totally understandable, it was my own fault for waiting so long). I was about to give up when I called lucky number 13, Esteem Cleaners. I'm amazed that they were able to dry clean my suit so quickly and remove all of the stains my prior drunk self left. The wedding was lit and of course, there are now more stains on my suit so I'm happy to go back to Esteem! Thank you for saving my irresponsible butt!</text>

<text>I tried this cleaners for the first time the other day. The customer service was great, they were happy & smiling when I dropped off my clothes & picked it up even though it was two different people helping me. They got my clothes ready a day before they said they would & it came out great. I would definitely recommend them.< /text>< GmapID>

<Review>This is my go to cleaners for any dry cleaning needs. They are knowledgeable, professional and consistently put out quality work. Whenever I point out a stain or require any services, it's always done right and in a timely manner. I'll be hard pressed (no pun intended) to find a comprable service.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_id>107448121978187490661< /user_id><time>1522515898252<//time></record>

<Text>Excellent timely service provided by a group of employees who take pride in their work, working together to provide professional service and exceed customer's expectations. They produce results which demonstrate that all dry cleaners are not alike. It's easy to see why the team at Esteem Cleaners was chosen as the California Dry Cleaners of the Year.

Was told my dresses would cost $14.99 to clean and when I picked them up they charmed me $34.99 each! What a scam!< /review>

The Chicago style pizza here is just amazing.  Having been to Chicago multiple times, this pizza hits the mark for taste.  It's not Chicago 'style' as it's not deep dish, etc. but they hit it perfect with the taste.< /review>

Ordered pizza online. Upon my arrival, they were in back and had to look up for my order. And she made mine in a rush.  Toppings were not spread evenly.< /review>

Skip the fast food and expensive restaurants and take a pizza home for  that family time. Find it fairly nice we have not had to wait long for our pizza, the drive home takes longer then to order & bake it at home.</Review>

This is your favorite pizza at a great price on your schedule. I can pay in advance and schedule a pickup. They also travel well. We take them to the cabin and cook them there for a fast and hot meal in front of the fire that everyone loves.< /text>

I go through half a roll of paper towels just mopping up the pizza grease from the bottom, the other half is for the top. Also have been consistently out of product which should reflect on the online store so I don't keep ordering products that they don't have in store.< /review>< pictures>

Found a three footlong hair in my pizza last visit but they did offer to give me my next pizza for half price. The only problem I've ever had there.

<review>The quality has gone way down, and the staff is very unprofessional. The menu has been modified (many items removed) and instead of a new menu, the eliminated items are just covered with transparent masking tape; very sloppy and cheap.</review>< Pics>

Just called to ask for help on ordering my pizzas online because if you order online you get 50% off your total. First person i spoke to had no clue about anything and was really short then he handed the phone off to someone else. The lady got on the phone and said " what is the problem" i told her and her answer was "well i guess it just doesn't work then" super rude. I asked for a manager she said she was the temp untill the actual one got back. I asked for her name and she refused to tell me, i asked again and again finally said a name "AUBRY" I will follow-up on this tomorrow with a daytime manager. I will never return to that location again.< /Review>

<text>I absolutely love Papa murphy's  pizza but the one on Coffee is horrible!! I order the same exact pizza every time and for some reason it costs me 3 dollars more at this location. Plus they charge me a dollar more for extra sauce. Extra sauce on the pizza.....who does that!! Then they don't even put any ugh. Also they tell you 15 to 20 minutes weather they're busy or not. The one on Chester Ave. Makes it as you're ordering it and they're always busy. I will drive out of my way to get pizza just to avoid this location even when I'm shopping just next door.< /text>< Date>

<Review>We found what we were looking for , but my two middle school aged daughters were approached by an employee of the store and were asked if she could give them some "words of encouragement"  She proceeded to hand them a bunch of jesus propaganda.  I feel like this is inappropriate behavior from an employee of a retail store and i also feel like she should solicit her religion on her own time and NOT to my minor children.<//Review>< response>

< review>
I have been shopping at my local factory 2-U for years, but today I ended really disappointed as I felt mistreated from the manager. I saw this really nice jacket for 12.99, but when I went to purchased it, it came up to 49.99. I explain to the lady that all the jackets were under the signed that said 12.99,  so she agreed the right thing to do was to give it to me for that price, but then came the manager saying no. I showed him how all the jackets where under that price of 12.99 so the right thing to do was to get it for that price because it was their mistake. He argued with me by saying no that it was a mistake and he took of the signed away and just walked away not letting me finish my argument. I felt he didn't give the respect as a costumer or even a human being, as he left me talking to my self. I left so disappointing that I have decided to not go there ever again and to make sure my family no longer shops at that store!!!!</review>

This place was completely thrashed. Couldn’t walk down any rows let alone push a cart down one. The employees were rude. Had an issue with my daughter taking one bag of candy off the shelf to grab the bag behind it and said something rude. Like the rest of the store looked spotless? Please. So unorganized and disgusting</Review>

Dont shop here. Especially when Edwin is working. He likes to charge for the same item twice. That happened to me and my mother-in-law. She worned me, but i didnt lisen. I went back to the store to return some items i didnt need and to tell him that I have been charge for the same item twice thinking that this store will be like any other stores. Instead, I was shocked to hear such stupid and nonsense excuses of why I should NOT get my money back. Mr. Edwin told me that I HAVE to bring everything I have purchased so that he could see what item was the one I was compleining about. I told him that I had been away and when i returned and checked the receip and notice the extra charge, which i thought was no big deal until I got yell at by Mr. Edwin.
The money is not the issue i am writing this. The issue here is this guy who needs to be replace. He is such an ass@?@/$. He is not just rude to customers like myself who spent over $100 on this great store, but to other employees as well. He does not respect women because according to his words "thats not how things are done" I will not return to this store until this thift is fire. And i will tell everyone i know not to shop here either.
I just wish the owner of the store reads this and gets rid of this guy who knows nothing about customer service. Lesson to be learned here, always check your receives, especially at this store and if you were helped by this guy, Edwin.<//text>

It's hard to find anything (clothes) that are priced more than $20. Great deals on brand new clothes!<//review>

I needed a tune up. Someone told me to go to Rose Automobile. So, I went there today around 8:30am. Then about 5 to 10 minutes later Chuck called me and said I didn't need a tune up. I could come and get my car!! No charge for anything!! This was the greatest experience I have ever had at a auto shop!! I am so grateful for them being so honest with me!!!!</review>

<review>We have been to this place twice. These guys are honest and quick. I got calls on every step they made. They do not over charge on labor and don't do a huge mark up on part . I recommend Rose to everyone!< /review>< pictures>

<username>Lori Bennett<//username><text>Rose Automotive is always so accommodating when I call to ask if they can check my car THAT day.
Polite and very explanatory when it comes to what the problem is.
My mom use to take her car there when she drove.
In the 90s. And now I we take our cars and my two daughters cars there.
Highly recommend them.< /text>< Date>

Chuck is the best, he's honest, cares for his customers. Resolved a 3-month problem. 2 others (autoshop and a recommend mechanic) who could not find the issue/problem. Rose Automotive mechanic(s) took less than 24hrs to figure the problem, my car was ready (am) on the third day. #reliable #thankyouGuys<//text>

My check engine light came on and I called around. These guys checked my code for free within minutes of driving up. They told me what it read (verified through third party). I told them I had a trip coming up and wanted a healthy vehicle, they said this issue wouldn't affect my trip and to go ahead and come back afterward. That's honesty! Also, their diagnostic service is more reasonable than other places I checked with< /text>

Don't wanna get ripped off? Go here! I always take my cars to Rose Auto! Honest and respectful shop with perfect knowledge of automotive repair. Very friendly and professional staff. I was quoted for $995 at Honda dealership and they repaired it for $368 and even got me towed to their shop. As long as I live in SD county I'll be taking my car here.</Text>

Rose Automotive has a 5 star in my book. They have great customer service as well as top notch quality work. My 10yr old car is like brand new and I may get more miles out of it yet. Thank you Chuck, you are the best.< /Text>

<Text>I had problems with my car while nearby and had to look for an auto repair shop in the vicinity. Rose Automotive popped up on the search and had the best reviews, so I went with it, and I can't describe how happy I am with that decision. I always feel like car shops are typically shady or try to milk you for as much money as possible, but that absolutely wasn't the case here. The staff were professional and friendly, handled my warranty company for me, replaced my alternator and had my car ready the same day the part arrived. If I have problems again, this is the first place I'll turn to.< /Text>< date>

<text>Smoged my 97 RV C class for 65!! Great deal, the nice thing about them is that if your vehicle does not pass they will not charge. Unlike other places they will charge the certificate fee, and they’ll even tell you what u can do or what’s wrong to make it pass.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>EDIT: BE ADVISED. ROSE AUTOMOTIVE IS NOT A REPAIR GARAGE. IT IS ONLY LICENSED FOR SMOG CHECKS. ANY REPAIRS YOU GET HERE ARE DONE THROUGH A SEPARATE BUSINESS IN THE GARAGE NEXT DOOR. THEY WILL PASS THE OVERHEAD COSTS ON TO YOU.

My wife and I took our car in to have a small part replaced. Nothing major, just something to get it to pass smog.

First they needed to wait on a part, but told us they'd have it by end of day only to call us after an entire day of waiting to tell us they had received the wrong part and the car was in pieces and they'd have to double charge for labor if they put it back together. Wife and I had to take a day off work because it's our only car. 1st day wasted

Next day rolls around and they wait until almost 4pm to call us and let us know they never got the part, so they put ours back together and let us take it home promising we would only be charged for the initial labor. 2nd day wasted

Fast forward a week, we are told the part is in. Brought it in right at 8am only to be told by a guy named "Tim" that they actually never got the part. So we leave with nothing again. 3rd day wasted

One more week later, "Tim" calls us to tell us they have the part and presses that we show up early because it will take him all day to do it. Probably the rudest guy there. We drop the car off 10 minutes before they open and are given another promise that the work will be done before close. Well, 1 hour before they close, we get a call telling us they don't have the time and to bring it back on a weekday. 4th day wasted.

That brings us to now. Car still has had no work done and we have wasted 4 Saturdays trying. One of us will have to take another day off work to make sure this job gets done and at this point it feels like a gamble either way. 5th day to be wasted. At this point, we are looking at other options.

On top of all that, it seemed like they kept opening new work orders every time we brought the car in despite the original work order never being completed. While the guys working here seem like nice people, it doesn't seem like communication or long term memory take a priority.<//Text><user_name>Justin Credible<//user_name><user>110038401626097848692<//user><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

I love Fur Babies! They are an awesome group of Groomers. I have a senior dog and they are absolutely on top of remembering his back problems with each visit. Plus, Stephanie gives him the absolute best haircuts he's ever gotten in his life, he gets so many compliments after a fresh cut.<//text>

THEY ARE OPEN.  They are wonderful. June 19th 2020. I picked up my little Peanuts the Wonder Dog.  They pay attention to hidden nails and ears are amazing.  His little summer cut looks so sweet. And he isn't afraid of this place.  He was a little cage shy so she held him at the front desk until they were ready for him. You will not be sorry for taking your babies here.  LOVE THIS PLACE<//Text>

Having a groomer I trusted for 20 years was challenging when we moved and had to find a new place. I just went to Petsmart because I thought it was trustworthy. No complaints except SUPER EXPENSIVE!

<rating>5<//rating><text>I was extremely impressed with the compassion and kindness they showed towards the pets they also observed the 6-foot social distancing that should be practiced and hand sanitizer. they only allowed one client in at a time. I will go there from now on and I recommend them to everyone I know. Awesome salon!< /text>< Pics>

It is a good place.  I looked the way my dog looked when I got him back.  I think my dog even liked the way he looked too.  He had a sassy attitude for a few days.</Review>

If I could more stars I would!  My dogs never want to leave after going in, they are treated like family!  All I can say is if you haven’t given them a try, you should. You just don’t find this type of personal, caring, quality service anywhere.  I wish they could add salon/barber services. I would rather they cut my hair.</Text>

<Review>Shaggy feels safe and hes always happy when I pick him up. I have taken him to other places and he looked so sad and depressed. My dog wont fight a cut but it's not his favorite thing. He does get nervous but Dani makes him feel very comfortable.
He also gets seizures and he has done well being at fur babies.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

This is a great shop.  Clean and easy parking.   They took our fur baby from cute to super adorable. Her first hair cut of many more. This is the best place with the most awesome and friendly people.  We found our place!!<//Text>

< Review>
We just tried this salon after years of price gauging at PetSmart. The Price alone was enough for me to try it, the quality will bring you back! Both my dogs were well groomed. There were no visible lines from the clippers. Nails, teeth, and haircut included without all the ridiculous add ons of the big box store. Chelsea was our Stylist, and I felt she went above and beyond to make sure my pups felt comfortable. My little terrier is neurotic and Chelsea was so understanding. Both dogs left with wagging tails. And I left knowing that we will be back in 4-6 weeks.  This place is a keeper!</Review>

The whole car rental deal wasn’t actually bad but what makes it unpleasant was that the rental agent specifically told me that if I returned the car after 5 pm and as long as the keys were in the drop box before they opened the next morning that I wouldn’t be charged an extra day’s fee. So, I took my time to finish my work and dropped it off before 5:30 and when I got the bill I was charged anyway. Had the agent not said that, I would have left my work earlier and dropped the car off by 5 pm. Just feels shady like a bait and switch tactic that leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Not cool and not the best business practice<//text>

My wife went online and reserved our vehicle. Submitting all the information they ask for online definitely makes the process easier. We got there, they met us outside, they pulled the car up we signed the tablet she had she went inside and processed the payment and we were able to go. Returning it was super easy too...we came back, handed them the keys and left. The deposit was refunded 2 days later. We will definitely be using them again!<//Text>

The car I rented from Enterprise performed fine, and the staff at the beginning and end points were gracious and understanding. I was disappointed when, after a couple of minutes driving the car, the "needs maintenance" sign lit up.  Obviously it had been lit before my time with the car, so I wondered how long the car had been driven with this warning light on.  I didn't have a long way to drive, from Petaluma, CA to San Francisco (maybe 40 miles) and then from San Francisco center to the SFO airport. (another 15 miles?) The car performed fine, but it is worrisome and disappointing to pay $85 a day for a car and then have to worry that it isn't in top condition, and may give you a problem somewhere unexpectedly.<//text>

I am new to renting cars but have done so several times in the last several months. Different locations offer better customer service than others (Petaluma, CA was excellent) but overall all my transactions have been relatively quick and efficient, with very clean vehicles taking care in extra COVID-19 measures.< /Text>

The people were friendly, yet professional. I ended up needing the car longer than I originally thought and they were wonderful about letting me extent my rental. I wish I could have gotten some sort of weekly discount, that would have been really nice. The car was in excellent condition and was a fun little car.</text>

This location very seldom has a good selection of cars, but I was able to get one and upon my return they charged me for gas. I had just filled up the tank to the same level it was when I received it, just under 3/4, which is irritating to begin with.  Cars should be full when rented out so the renter doesn’t have to try and figure out exactly where it should be!!
Anyway, they charged me for 7 gallons of gas at $6/gallon!! If I was off at all it would have been by no more than a gallon AT THE MOST! I sent an email and received NO RESPONSE, but three days later I get a request for a review, so here it is Enterprise. I’ll rent elsewhere from now on.<//Text>

<time>1591800594473<//time><Text>Sara & Manny  were a Huge help, our production company had a last minute need for 2 SUV's to go to Vegas and they had them ready to go
the moment we arrived - less then 30 mins later.
Also, the location in Vegas bothched the Billing and created a hassle
due to some confusion with a new employee ( not her fault, just a small
misunderstanding which was cured with a short call to Sara at the Petaluma
location. Sara has come thru for us on very short notice a few times and
the Petaluma and Auburn CA locations are fantastic.

If we needed the car longer than expected it was never a problem! Great Place! Last but not the least... good choice of vehicles and we never had a car break down on us or give us any trouble!

The customer service and cars are okay but don’t accidentally leave anything in the car! I forgot a $60 parking pass in the window and realized a few hours after returning the car, called immediately and they claim no one saw it and they do not have it. Really unfortunate!< /Review>

Not the best customer service in the office. I made this reservation on line. They gave me an "up-grade" at the location, because they did not have the economy car I reserved,( so why not tell me there were none available?) than tried to charge me 39.99 a day insurance. When I declined they then said I had to pay a minimum of 19.99 per day because it was a bigger car. I booked an economy and wanted to only pay 9.99 per day insurance. I was going refuse the rental altogether, than low and behold there IS an economy car after all, it just came in while I was at lunch......So great got the car and the insurance amount I wanted to pay, car was dirty and smelled. She did try and wash it herself to make it all right, therefore I will give here that. So, fast forward 5 days, I return the car and as I am getting a ride home, I was then informed that I could have, and should have been offered the weekend special of $9.99 per day Friday-Monday, (100 miles per day). Than charge me the rate of 22.99 for the other two day(unlimited miles) I drove a total of 527 miles.

So people book on line, look for specials, insist on getting what you booked and don't accept any BS and Used car sales tactics.....once they get your money they are not going to give any of it back. Oh no help with on-line customer service either, very rude. One lied and the other just didn't care.

I will continue to rent from Enterprise but I will drive to the one in San Rafael on Midway to be treated with respect and honesty.<//Review>

Great experience renting a car for the weekend. The E team was courteous, professional and very resourceful. I messed up my online reservation and they were able to fix it and give me the same deal. I also left something in the car and it was as easy as picking up the phone and someone ran out to retrieve it for me. Great customer service - very high touch.< /Text>

< review>
The service was great and the car was waiting for me upon my arrival. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the gas tank was only at  3/8 of a tank full. It was a drag to have to go fill the car up before I left on my trip.  All the cars should be full when a customer comes to pick up a rental.  Pick it up full bring it back full. The car had just been washed (it was wet when I received it) but once it dried there was some sticky stuff on the drivers door, so probably just hosed down.</review>

< Review>
I am very happy with the customer service I receive from Enterprise. Everyone is friendly and helpful.  The only problem I have is when I specifically ask for a compact/small car, and I get the next size up at the more expensive price. I should not have to pay more, when I reserve well in advance for the smallest size. Other than that, I have no problems with Enterprise or their staff. I will continue to do business with them and look forward to the friendly service I receive.<//Review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>Their customer service is poor.  This is my 3rd time reserving a mini-van with the Petaluma location and only once they got my reservation correct.  The 1st time, they canceled my reservation with no notice and now - today, they are trying to give me an SUV with no cargo space instead of a minivan that I have reserved for over 2 months ago.  I am so upset right now I just want to scream.  What good is a reservation if they can't give me what I reserved.   These people can't even tell the difference between an SUV and a minivan.<//Text><Time>1441828535203< /Time><GmapID>0x8085b41441cc0285:0x4c7e557337a421e0< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>The personal service I received from this branch, and have come to expect generally from Enterprise, is really extraordinary. Haley, the manager, is down-to-earth, takes a personal interest in her customers and offers high attention to detail. Other companies could learn a lot from Enterprise and hiring people like Haley.</text>< Rate>

I asked for the smallest cheapest deal they had and I ended up paying more than any other time I rented a car from this company. The best part was comparing to the offer you get in your email: $9.99 a day on weekend. I payed $86 for two days! So no I wasn't very happy this time... Overpriced!!!<//review>

< Review>
So, to start off I had a terrible experience here. I came in with my boyfriend because our car broke down and we needed to get back to our university in Washington  before the end of spring break. We called in and the gentleman who answered the phone assured us that we would be able to rent even though we didnt have a credit card with other pieces of information. We showed up and were met with an extremely rude and frankly stuck up employee who informed us that we couldn't. Now I understand that company policy is strict but we are hard working students and it was extremely frustrating to come across such implorable service. If you are having a difficult travel experience or look young, do not go to this company or this branch.</Review>

Recent car rental was very helpful when mine was  in body shop. It was my understanding that the body shop made  the  rental  reservation. However when I got to Enterprise no reservation had been made. Enterprise took care of me despite a lack of cars on lot. The car they did give me though had a horrendous smell inside rhat  i didnt fully appreciate until i left of course, and lot closed. Next day they allowed me to replace the car with a choice od cars and apologized for smell  and inconvenience.  As always enterprise did great service and fixed the issues without much delay for me. Thank you.<//review>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>In the past I have had a generally positive experience at Petaluma Enterprise; my recent experience not so much. I returned a car exactly 1 week to the hour after I rented it, but because the return was on Labor day, there was no one to check me in. When I received a receipt by email the next day, I noticed that I had been charged for a week plus one day. I called the office to get the bill corrected and was told that because my reservation had said I was going to return the car on the 8th day, they had no choice but to charge me. I explained that the reason the reservation showed a return on the 8th day was because their online reservation app wouldn't allow me to show that I would return the car the evening before. I have never had a problem of "returning a car early" and getting charged for time I didn't use a car (and I'm talking dozens of times). The Manager I spoke with was unhelpful and I waited two days for his regional Supervisor to call me back after leaving repeated messages. And when I called again there was no answer. My credit card is disputing the extra $75 charge...but it sure leaves a bad taste. BTW, my company probably spends about $500-1000/month on Enterprise Cars, wondering how they treat occasional users?<//Review></record>

<Date>1479587946081</Date><review>If you're a Coastie from Tracen Petaluma, Don't ever rent here. Worst experience ever. I called to make a reservation and asked for a pick up at a certain time. I called that morning to make sure and was told by a very rude man that they don't pick up at that time and the lady who told me that made a mistake.  Get it together enterprise! Then, I take Uber there to pick up the car and that same man was very rude. If you hate your job that much, quit!  Then, I drop the car off a day early.  A week later, get charged double the agreed price because they said I drove over a 100 miles past their limit, which was a complete lie. I wish I had taken a picture of the mileage before and after. But, I was just too excited to have a car. I learned my lesson. I don't ever write reviews, but I just want to warn every Coastie, don't ever go there. Like enterprise, but thanks to this location, never going there again.< /review>< UserId.>

< Review>
I reserved a car online Sunday for a Monday morning pickup. I was given a larger, less fuel efficient vehicle for the quoted price but charged 50% MORE PER DAY for liability insurance.
The clerk with her obviously brand new $49.99 business degree with the emphasis on customer service told me that I had the option to decline insurance and they charged more for a "nicer" car. I told her I didn't want the larger less efficient car and shouldn't have to pay more but her unsatisfactory answer was that my only choice was to decline the insurance and therefore assume the liability for any possible damage myself. This answer was unacceptable but I took the car because I didn't have time to argue this unfair, unethical and possibly illegal practice.
Details are as follows: reserved 12/13 for 10AM Monday 12/14 Rental agreement #32ZMD4
Rude employee #E580KB   Vehicle Lic#7GSZ2094 Car#7KSX4T
Partly because of this business practice and partly because of the incompetent customer service, I will not rent from Enterprise again nor will I recommend Enterprise to the regular out-of -town guests who visit me and frequently need to rent cars.< /Review>

Finding Enterprise in Petaluma has made my visits to this area so much more enjoyable. I arrive at SFO and take the Sonoma Airporter to the Petaluma Fairgrounds. Enterprise staff pick me up there and take me to their office to get the rental car. When I return the car, the staff take me back to the fairgrounds to get the shuttle back to SFO. The staff have been entirely courteous and friendly.</text>

Horrible service. Do not use if you value actually keeping your reservation. Not only do they not keep your reservation, you get a "sorry, out of luck".<//Text>

<Review>We had to deal with a Jacqueline Tiznado, totally unprofessional, did not care about the case, she seemed to only care about getting her money. We had to do most of the work for her, she didn’t even know when her clients court hearing was, tried little to no effort about building a case, was difficult to get a hold off, rude, discourteous; don’t waste your money here.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

If I could give a 0 I would. Just wow, is all I'm going to say. First off, the telephone appointment I had was at 6 they called me at 6:17 to you know get my card info to pay. Luckily my sister has/had a case there so they didn't charge me the $60 for consultation fee.  The receptionist let me know I would get a call shortly.. 30 minutes later at 6:50, they call and some guy named Albert/Gilbert whatever the name was, was the one "consulting" me. Call was very brief didn't really ask me anything just the obvious questions about applying for citizenship, (time frame/price) meanwhile eating or idk maybe has a lisp and kept sounding like he had stuff in his mouth. when I asked if he would be able To assist in sponsoring my parents when becoming a citizen he didn't want to speak to me just told me to tell my parent to go in office to speak about that. I let him know that they already went and we're advised to have me go with them. I explained I can't call off work it's very hard. Told me they didn't need me, to just have my parents go AGAIN for an appt. Told him again well why would they advise them in the first place to have me call? Continued to cut me and my sister off and advise my parents come in. Sure they won't charge them but I'm not sure why my parents would go in again? Maybe to talk about the SAME things? Who knows. Also, my sister mentioned her case has the petition they were asking and this guy Albert said he couldn't look for it because he had nothing to write her name down lol. What kind of professional doesn't have a pen and paper to write down client info? I wonder what excuse they'll come up with my review, since they either say they have no idea who most of these "clients" are or to "call" them. Anywho, yeah to all the people complaining they they're not helping them. Just take it to the BBB. Also, like I said. I'm so glad I didn't waste $60 on a 10 minute "consultation" lol. there's a lot of good lawyers out there just look at their reviews on google and yelp. I only went because my sister went . But looking at their reviews... I would not have gone here ._. You live and you learn.

Rudolph replied to my review on yelp which you can go see and this is my reply:

In response to Rudolph's reply:
To correct you, the call lasted 11 minutes. I have my call log if you want a copy of it. Not sure where the extra 9 minutes came from? Secondly I did hear you in the background and am very ashamed of you that you allowed a behavior such as your trainee which I'm assuming has to be a trainee since he was very rude and unprofessional. 3) And yes, I am too busy to go to a "law firm" that the assistant/ trainee was eating while speaking to me and cutting me off. I had an immigration lawyer that was 40 minutes away and I would constantly make the drive since they were a RESPECTFUL, TRUSTWORTHY, and PROFESSIONAL company. Unfortunately the attorney passed and I am forced to find another immigration attorney. And trust me when I say, this location would be not be an option. I can make the drive to a place I trust and unfortunately this is not it. Rudolph just confirmed this as he lied and stated he was on the call for 20 minutes. My parents also obviously can make the drive but not to a "law firm" as this. There’s a difference between can’t make time or choosing not to. Lastly, I can definitely agree with you as your 3 star reviews show you are a trust worthy and "top notch" immigration law firm. Again, to all potential clients. Please do your research, look at google and yelp reviews before choosing just any attorney to handle your case. Also, complain to the BBB if your case is not handled. I don't want another false statement, so no reply would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</text>

<text>HI James,
I guess you know this already but I left you multiple voice mail messages as I called you directly and through your office staff, I know you must have received and ignored my continued requests for your insight and expertise. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL You have refused to return my calls. You mentioned in your ads "Pay the consultation fee and you have an attorney for life" Well where was that attorney that I paid my consultation fee at? When I needed guidance and insight on how to proceed and navigate through Immigration processes. You have betrayed and violated basic but elemental human and business decency. It would be nice if your clients were as important to you as the money your charge for your services. I am very disappointed in your inability to return a simple phone call. Your staff is also very unhelpful.</text>< Response>
{'time': 1583107095089, 'text': 'I have no idea who you are. Call me at my personal number 619-906-0000. I answer my phone on evenings and weekends as well. I am at my office daily for a consult. I accept walk ins and am in my San Diego office Monday through Thursday 3-6:30 pm, at a minimum.  I assume you are not a client or you would have my card with my cell number on it. However I never give legal advise over the phone unless you have contracted to be my client. You are right , If you paid a consult you can have unlimited visits to my office for free for further consults. If you think not giving consults over the phone make me unprofessional, I’m sorry you feel that way.'}</Response>

I had a great experience at R B and Associates.  I entered the office with hesitation, not knowing what to expect. I was promptly greeted and explained what could be done to help my case.  I was given a few options, other attorneys had only given me one option.  The attorney was able to answer all my questions and give her advice.   The attorney general as well versed and very knowledgeable.  Thanks Rudolph Baker and Associates, you really helped me out and it is because of your awesome attorneys that I was able to get a favorable outcome of my case!< /text>

<Review>Bad experience and terrible service totally unprofessional. I visit there office in Tijuana to help me on a TN visa and my boss and me was assured by the lawyer that I will have it after they worked on it. The result it was denied by the consulate. Me and my boss  called several times the lawyers direct number, cell number and office number plus Emails to and did not answer until 2 days later. I went to their office with the information they requested and the consulate provided and was told that they will appeal or do something else but nothing ever happened for a month and 1/2 and we  (Me and my boss )called again several times but could never reach the lawyer even by Email. Totally disappointing I expected much more professionalism and commitment from you to us. Would never recommend!!!< /Review>< pics>

At the initial consultation they seem great and really sell their firm. My parents agreed to start their immigration case with them. HOWEVER we had to go back and fourth, three different times because they never mentioned ALL the paperwork needed from the affidavit of support my parents needed. We finally managed to take everything needed to submit the paper work; we thought everything was ok. A week later I ask my mom to call in and get the confirmation that they did indeed filled the paperwork, guess what they never did. Aldo, the guy that was filling the paperwork, was on vacation. Ok lets give them the benefit of the doubt. I call again to see if they've finally filled the paperwork, Aldo is too busy to give me a call back, or anyone else in that office. OVERALL they seem unorganized, if they can’t keep track of their clients paperwork don't take more cases. For my immigration case (at a different firm) they gave me a complete list of EVERYTHING I needed, once I managed to gather everything, I went in once, and the next day the lawyer sent me an email that my paperwork had been filed, with the same exact price as Baker and Associates.</review>

Ultimately they got the job done.  But many of the problems were due to the individual in Tijuana that did not listen to the issues we were experiencing.  Finally after a long time we changed to the other office which got us back on track.  Adam and staff were great.  The main problem with the San Diego office is the lack of returnings calls if it doesn't involve makink payments.  Currently l have been leaving messages because I need back original documents and I do not get back a call after leaving numerous messages.  So I will have to travel to the San Diego office to make my request in person.<//text>

(Translated by Google) I want to thank Alberto Trujillo because he behaved in a professional way when he attended me and answered my question. I put a star for YESENIA ORTIZ's arrogant way of scheduling my date, we are adults and there are ways of talking. He told me that they did not attend to people with my situation and that they could not help me. Now I went to Alberto Trujillo and he told me the best option to proceed. People who need information talk to the lawyers and not the receptionists because they may get discouraged and not follow through with their situation. Check in with the lawyers and make appointments with the receptionists. Each one his place and we all win.

Gente que necesite informacion hablen con los abogados y no las recepcionistas porque puede que se desanimen y no prosigan con su situacion.

First you find out what happened in the courts because your relative talks to you because they don't do it until they want and wash their hands

Tengan cuidado por favor porque no es justo que se aprovechen así de la desesperación y la necesidad de las personas
Un buen abogado te defiende no te entrega y te dice mejor firma la salida voluntaria porque si eso fuera no buscaríamos ayuda

(Translated by Google) They are incompetent lawyers if I do not call or find out that my mother has an appointment when she supposedly had her package ready they call to go and collect it not that there is another paper missing then for the hell they say that everything is ready three days after the appointment and even the package It is incomplete, perhaps they do not know what requirements they need, oh, even if they look at the package, I have to travel by train, annoying the endorsement every time, I am so disappointed with these lawyers, if they have the opportunity, look for others, even if they pay dearly, but do not bring them from their asshole like me.

Son unos abogados incompetentes si no llamo ni me entero que mi mama tiene cita cuando ya supuestamente tenia su paquete listo llaman que vayan a recojerlo no que falta otro papel entonses para que carajos disen que esta todo listo atres dias de la cita y aun el paquete esta incompleto acaso no saben que rekisitos necesitan oh ni sikiera ojean el paquete tengo ke viajar en tren molestar a cada rato alos aval estoy tan desilucionada de estos abogados si tienen oportunidad busquen a otros aunke paguen caro pero ke no los traiga de su pendejo como ami</text>

I clarify, James never shows up to your court, they assign you another lawyer ... nor answer calls

My new shower door is spectacular.  I wanted a pristine and simple look for my bathroom. The result is definitely an upgrade from the old with a bright appeal. I selected M and M builders after meeting with two other contractors. The company's initial presentation was professional. During the course of my renovation I was pleasantly surprised with their business model integrating different check-ins to ensure everything was to my liking. Of course after you paid a lot of money you want everything perfect.  The team worked with me to the very end to ensure I was happy. I give the company a 5 rating for customer service - approach is distinguished.<//text>

<time>1613244315621< /time><rate>5</rate><Text>This is a late review, but with the pandemic I finally have the time to make sure I recommend this company. We had work done in April of 2019 to close off the loft portion of our second bedroom to turn the bedroom into a nursery. Joe was very professional and courteous, did an amazing job. My son was born a bit earlier than expected, so the team did their best to get everything completed beforehand. They came and completed the last minute touches and did such a great job. Great people, would definitely work with them again!< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2977fca44544b:0x104dc09f1c13cb17< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We hired them to install new laminate in three rooms and hallway and are so pleased with the results! The job took only 2.5 days which was quick but not too quick because they took their time ensuring it looked perfect. The transitions between rooms are seamless. Other quotes we got charged more for baseboards for MM Builders Group simply included them in the price! Our Project Manager, Joe, communicated often and clearly. We will be hiring them for more jobs in our house in the future!< /review>

<Review>We've used M.M. Builders for multiple projects and are always pleased with their work, responsiveness, and professionalism. In the last two years, Joe and the entire team have done a variety of projects for us, including painting, refinishing hardwood floors, and building an addition for our kitchen, complete with matching cabinetry and stone. When we're planning a project, we call Joe first. He's honest, fair, and extremely knowledgable. As a homeowner, having a trustworthy general contractor is crucial; we're glad we can rely on them. Thank you, guys!</Review>< Pics>

<review>This company is very professional and amazingly quick! We had our pool broken since 2016 and this year we decided it was time to use it again, spending so much time in-doors, a swim now and then is very nice. Johnny was so nice and helpful and he and his team finished the job in record time. They took the COVID-19 measurements  seriously and cared for our safety at all times which we appreciate so much! We're ready for summer.< /review><user_id>106540441495207181050<//user_id>< Pics>

I could not be happier with my experience with this company! The owner was always quick with getting back to me and his crew was very professional. The crew cleaned up well at the end of each work day and they periodically sent pictures of the progress. I would definitely choose them again! Highly recommend!</Review>

we meet with Joe and Mike they give us a very detail explanation of how they will perform the project and we love it, it was a full remodeling for our old and dysfunctional 1.5 bathroom they relocated the toilet and that make a huge difference, also our kitchen they did flooring, demolition of old cabinets and replace it with a beautiful, modern and much more spacious cabinets, Mike was always available when we call him, and he was checking on the project very often, the workers were really respectful of our property, Our kitchen turned out great and we will definitely be using MM Builders Group for our next project.</text>< resp>

I love LITTLE CEASARS PIZZA but, this location is not a good place to come visit because I am eating a pizza with little to no pizza sauce. I've mentioned it, before. I guess I have to ask beforehand while ordering.< /Text>

Not the best place to go to. Ran by kids that dont know how to cook.
My pizza always comes with a air bubble.
And I ask for light cause not cheese and bread.< /Review>

Pizzas are good. The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because usually when the two schools close by are out there's hardly never hot ready pizza available you have to wait 15 minutes.  I think they should know by now to have a few pizza stack up.<//review>

So this is clearly not wat I ordered. I got a 'CHEESE PLAIN PIZZA' When I Custome ordered Topings(Pepperoni and  Jalapenos) on it!! I'm really upset about this, I didnt want to waste my time going back, since I ordered this to go for a date at the drive in movies In paramount! I also used the Portal App. And I noticed you cant review or add comments on it. That's inconvenient!</Text>

Not a bad little Cesar's but occasionally the pizza dough is still raw and the top is burned not always but it does happen! If you're handicapped dont expect to get a parking  spot since everyone feels like it's just a open spot to park and nobody enforces it wich is a pet pieve of mine!</Text>

< Review>
They never answer the phone and make stupid excuses about not answering the phone and they try to sell you a regular pizza for a pretzel crust pizza they are not honest. Thy never have anything ready wait is over 10 minutes. Thy are liers if they ran out of the pretzel crust they should just say so and not try to sell a regular pizza for a pretzel crust. Thy leave phone of hook so thy don't have to take phone orders I am going to contact corporate they properly represent littel ceasar.< /Review>

Nasty! There is an after taste ( like a diet soda) to the pizza😵 I usually eat Little Caesars Pizza & never noticed the after taste. Did something change via preparation?< /Review>

2 stars only because they usually (it's inconsistent) make the pizza at this location better than the other ones, but the service just plain sucks. What is up with the female employees? I think I've only encountered one courteous female, an older woman with Hispanic accent (loved her!), and the rest are just super short with me, rude and act as if I'm inconveniencing them just because I decided to order a pizza. I'm not a rude customer at all. I'm always patient and polite, but I still receive snobby service. Honestly, the management needs to train employees on their customer service skills or take complaints seriously because I've seen this at other locations too. I'll just start buying pizza at Dominos. The employees are much nicer and there isn't inconsistency with the quality of the pizza I receive.</review>

every time I have been at this local they have always made me wait 15 to 20 mins when I order a deep dish pizza. it kind of defeats the purpose of coming here because the pizzas are "hot and ready". that's BS. don't waste your time at little caesar's, just go to pizza Hut or dominos. they always seem to have some sale that rivals them.</Review>

The truth is for me the quality and taste of these pizzas is better than others and apart from that you pay less $. Luxury, there are these pizzas and the people who work there simply do their job well, and that's what matters.
