From the minute I asked in the staff at Meece Auto Stereo were polite and engaged me in conversation about what I'm was looking for. They intuitively knew exact what sound I expected from a quality system. I'm impressed by their knowledge and experience, and I can't wait to experience music on another level in my car.<//Review>

From the first day I inquired about their services I was treated with the utmost respect. Not once did I feel like I was being taken advantage of or being talked into product or services I didn't need... like some other places out here. In fact, Jeff went the extra mile to help me out with what turned into a tricky job and helped make the best of the situation. You guys are amazing! Thank you so much for everything and doing a clean, beautiful job!! Definitely the ONLY car audio shop to go to in the AV hands down!!!

< review>
This is a place where the owner admittedly calls people and harasses them for reviews that he does not like. Incredibly unprofessional. You don’t have to agree with a review that was posted, but to call your potentially returning customers and harass them and then say that you have the right to continue to call and harass them over a review is absolutely astounding. Floored that this is a real thing that the owner does. His Unprofessionalism is outweighing his service at this point.<//review>

The owner was very helpful, he gave me several options.  I made my selection and had it installed on Friday 10/11/19. Dropped off my truck and picked it up when promised.  The price was very reasonable and the workmanship was excellent.

< review>
I had bought a amp from  them a couple years ago and had them install it with a sub i had bought elsewhere. I was extremely pleased, i spoke with the owner for awhile and he really treated me like a friend. When I showed up with my truck for them to do the installation they seemed just as excited as i was to hear how everything sounded. I went back a few days ago to have another amp installed in my commuter car and the service was just as good as it was a couple years ago if not better, the staff of super friendly and they have very competitive pricing. The speaker i bought from them for my car was almost $50 cheaper than anywhere else!!  I will be going back soon to have them put in car alarm. You guys have a loyal customer for life with me. Thank you.<//review>

Meece audio is by far the best out there. Jeff has been at it for a long time and his team of experianced installers do great work. They have done many audio systems for me over the years and they always put together a kick a$$ system and stand by their work.< /text>

Fantastic service and prices!!!! I go there for all my audio needs and I'm never disappointed!!! The Meece audio team is incredible. When you find a high quality audio shop like Meece you'll think overpriced, but that is far from the case! They have what you need at a more affordable price than these cheap low quality audio installation facilities! I've been into car audio for at least 19 years and you cannot go wrong with Meece. Jeff is awesome and so is Jay!! Thanks for everything guys! Sincerely, Rosario.</review>

Excellent customer service! Very helpful! Everything from helping the experienced audiophile fine tune their personal setup to complete custom installs for the inexperienced that just want a great audio experience while on the road. I've done my own stereos for years and these guys are the only ones I'll trust to do my stereos if I cant myself.</text>

Hands down the best Car Audio shop in Antelope Valley and Surrounding Areas. The staff is super friendly and accessible. I like the fact that they are not snooty (as in We are the installers, you need us).....

They also did not give me any push back when I wanted to do my system piece by piece (Not everyone can throw down 1k for a system up front).....My speaker install was treated with the same respect as the guy before me doing a full blown system install.......

Support these guys! You won't be disappointed

I gave myself some time to review this company to give other potential customers a fair and honest review. Though my speakers sounded Amazing when they were first installed and I was truly satisfied with the entire process from start to finish, I waited because  I was told they would sound better in about 20 To 30 hours of use. To be honest? I'm upset I didn't give this place 5 stars sooner. This place truly deserves 5 stars. Amazing products, fast service, great staff and great work. After about 20 hours of hard use I can honestly say they sound even better now then when they were first put in. I would recommend this place to everyone and look forward to coming back. Honestly thank you guys.< /Text>

<Review>Professional group of car audio experts.  They were very knowledgeable and didnt try to push products you dont need, they lay it out for the essentials and even explained why additional equipment wasnt required.  Install was clean and well worth the wait.  Will be returning.< /Review>< pictures>

Great guys! Had an issue with my aux port and they told me right away what part I needed to get. Very next day I brought my car in and they popped my new aux port in at free of charge since the service literally took seconds.

I was more than willing to pay the $10 I was originally quoted, but they are great and honest guys all around!<//review>

Had to go there for court ordered device on car. They we're always very nice and I like the way one of their employees made a sheriff wait his turn when he walked in and acted like he owned the place and shouldn't have to wait. I appreciate a place that isn't afraid of the pig's and does what's right. I was being helped at the time and the sheriff didn't want to wait his turn but had to. We the people don't get much justice from them so anything is much appreciated.<//text>

This one goes out to all the staff! When I go here it's nothing but charisma, and thats hard to find in customer service amiright? You're all awesome workers and put some serious skill in to the audio industry. I never knew how healing music could be before buying a sound system from Meece. Probably going to be deaf by my 40's but I asked for it, not your fault! Please never disappear, and this is coming from ventura, I recommend everyone in AV to see you first. And I'll be getting another bumping system from you only because I dont see myself in a vehicle without one and y'all were ahhhmazing. Have a good day.</Text>

Though I've never been there... this guy saved my hide. I had bought a used car that had a clifford alarm with an ignition control switch. I had no idea what to do or how cutting wires would change the outcome. The tech walked me step by step by memory on how to disarm it, even though I took up close to an hour of his time on the phone he wasn't rushing me or upset... calm knowledgeable and helpful. Even though I'm in Bakersfield I would drive here in a second for any car stereo or alarm needs...absolutely awesome and I owe this shop a huge a debt.</text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>This place is awesome! The whole time we have been stationed at Edwards AFB I have been coming here....the customer service is great and they take care of their military......down to helping me (a military spouse) when my husband is deployed and I reconnect my speakers incorrectly...without judging me with laughter and no charge. I've never had a bad experience....ever. I suggest making an appointment because due to their awesomeness they are pretty busy.... but for something simple I'm 90% sure they will fit you in between, if your patient. It's hard to find a place where the prices are great, staff is awesome and the business is ethical. They will not do anything to your vehicle that would jeopardize its integrity like some others (the previous owner on one of my vehicles had a system put in improperly which messed with the electrical system....which they were able to correct, thankfully) just because it can be done does not mean it should be....and they will educate you on that.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Top quality systems with the people that know how to do it right. I highly recommend Meece for all audio and security system needs. Today I needed an old keyless entry system repaired in my Silverado, an upgrade to my high end custom sound system in my Corvette and a solution for adding bass to a system in a standard cab Toyota Tacoma. Complete satisfaction with all three installations. If you have space issues behind the seat of your small truck, they have the solution.<//Text>< Pics>

Fast, amazing-friendly staff. Came in, helped me in a matter of a minute. Got me setup, stereo installed, and out the door in a matter of 35-40 minutes. Stereo is EXCELLENT! I now have bluetooth/an auxiliary port, and a USB to charge my phone... in my ancient car. AND it sounds AMAZING! Thank you guys. Will be coming back to you again!<//text>

<review>Took the truck im for a new radio. It's a Dodge power wagon which is a 2500, ok, but the Infinity system was different than listed for interface modules. Jeff Meece looked at the wiring and said Dodge used 1500 parts for the Infinity, no problem, we have the parts to make it work.
Cool.< /review><name>RAD ONE< /name>< user>

I called Meece audio and told them the situation with my previous radio, they told me how much it will be and how long it will take. I went down, showed them the radio, they showed me some of their options and I went with a Kenwood KDC-X3 and I love it. It sounds sooooooo much better and it was a price I can do. I will for sure bring my next car over here to get it done by them. Great job! I love it<//Text>

I stopped by there twice now. My first visit had me considering everything i wanted and i was happy but never really took the time to consider everything at all.
So i went back not to long ago and they took the time to feel me out and see exactly what it is i want. Then when they figured it out they showed me several different speakers that would fit the sounds i like for the music i listen to and i couldn't be happier. I was in there for a little over an hour testing and listening to all different sorts of speakers set ups and subs it was really worth the trip. I also said that i was looking to make this a several month project due to the fact i don't have the money to do it all in one trip and with out missing a beat i was sat down and we worked out a plan to make this happen. As of right now i couldn't be happier with what I'm about to spend my money on and i will write another review once i get everything fully installed. THE STAFF IS BEYOND NICE, CARING, AND ITS VERY OBVIOUS THEY TAKE THE TIME TO DO OUTSTANDING WORK AND LOVE WHAT THEY DO< /Text>

They have installed radios into my Son's car and my Wife's truck. Last week I brought in my Acura TL for a new radio and dashcam. The folks at Meece did not try to oversell me on things I did not need. They did a heck of a job! In order to do the install, they had to disassemble my car's entire dashboard and center console. I dropped by mid-way thru to check in with them and upon seeing my car's dash so completely taken apart, I was a tad concerned. However, everything was put back together perfectly and it looks like my car rolled out of the show room with that radio and dashcam installed. Great work.

I'd recommend Meece Car Audio 1000%</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>(Pa Kewwwww) That was the sound of my mind being blown when I picked my car up from Meece's today. To some it up short, take your car NO WHERE ELSE for your audio needs. I have never met a more friendly and helpful staff. Dave and Jeff are amazing, friendly and extremely knowledgeable. They were able to give me exactly what I wanted plus more, I didn't break the bank, nor did I have to surrender my first born lol. Dave explained a lot to me about what they were installing, the quality I was getting, and how they would handle the installation. Brian the fabrication guy was awesome, he did an amazing job, everything is hidden beautifully. He fine tuned the settings to my Bluetooth which was very cool of him to do, he also showed me where and how they hid the amps.  Very cool and knowledgeable dude. I couldn't have asked for a better guy to fabricate this system into my car. The original two guys who greeted me each day, tho I don't know their name's, which I feel bad about. Were very friendly and tentative. I was greeted each day immediately upon arriving. Allowing me to know these were the right people to bring my car to. Not only did I know they'd due their job, but that they cared about doing a good job and going above and beyond. The ladies who greeted me inside, Nicole and Kelsie(may have spelt that wrong if so, sorry) also were very friendly and helpful. They made sure to keep me informed of my cars status and helped me get a suitable time slot to bring in the car. They where both tentative and on top of things going on each day I visited. After seeing the work for myself, meeting the staff, and driving the car home listening to the new system. I understand why these guys and gals are the best. MEECE'S made my day. They have earned my business for life. And deserve every star I can give them. Thank you guys so much again! I look forward to stopping back by soon.</Review>< Pics>

Highly recommend Franklin - We had a really smooth process working with him on my husband's green card. he is highly knowledgeable, made everything super easy, and he was very responsive any time we had a question - day or night. I don't think this process could have been made easier! If you're looking for legal help on immigration, Franklin is your guy!</text>

I had a 30-min consulting session with Franklin Tzeng. Excellent experience! Franklin is both professional and kind. I wanted to file a change-of-status case with him, but he suggested against because it might leave a bad record for me. He put me first instead of making money, a rare trait among lawyers. I'll definitely come back to him for my future legal status needs.< /Text>

From all of the law groups, this is the best one that I've came across. I had a very complicated case regarding my Visa, which is always a hassle as many have to experience. When I went searching for a good attorney, even the more well known law firms were unprofessional but Franklin was superb. If you ever need a good law firm regarding your immigration, Franklin should be your first choice because they are there to help you. Not just for the money, but they genuinely want to help your life, which is one of my favorite characteristics of this law firm.</text>

I was looking for a immigrantion lawyer to help me process my H1B transfer，a friend of mine who had a good experience with him gave me his contact.
Very easy going person. Actually I was shocked when I found out that he is so experienced and he doesn't show off. Most of his clients are repeat clients (as me) and referrals which means he knows how to help people and actually does it.
If somebody asks me if I know a good lawyer I just give them Franklin’s number.👍👍👍<//text>< Name>

Going from L-1 to green card，Franklin helped me prepared all the documentation required to file for an eb-1c and soon every thing started falling in place. I am now at the last stage of my green card, just an interview to go. Franklin helped me a lot not only in the immigration process，but also gave me lots of valuable business suggestions for my company here. I will not hesitate recommending his services to any one.< /text>

<text>I have so much confidence in Franklin International. I have two sisters, all three of us were put in a bad situation because of our immigration status and just the discomfort that goes along with that. Just walking in the office, made me feel comfortable. Even though it was so professional, it still had a homey feel to it which I noticed most offices have a cold feeling to them. So I was already comfortable then talking with the lawyers and staff, I felt more better. They did everything to make sure I madd the most from my case and then giving a sense of safety for my sisters as well. One thing about Franklin that is so good and so unique is they actually take the time to talk to you one on one and get to understand everything about your case to make better legal decisions. Franklin made me feel like things were possible for my family.< /text>< name>

<text>I am here for my citizenship application. The service and advise they provided are very professional. The LuLu is the one who work on my case. I am a Chinese , came to the United States in 06.Had many times of experience dealing for my  immigration process. From my experience, LuLu are very professional and friendly , also has a lot of experience for all different type immigration casese. For the immigration ，every person has different backgrounds and requirements, the lawyer needs make very personalise plan for different person or case. LuLu did very good job on that, she keep me updated on my case and help me go through all the form and material, give me a lot of detailed advice. Compare the lawyer I had before , LuLu is one of the best.After all I am so glad I found this place and highly recommend come to here if you need any help from immigration, businesses, legal advice…they are very good at it and very professional!!!<//text><username>Zhao Haitao</username></record>

< Review>
last night was the first time we went to this magnificent restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last time. We had a good time with the efficient service, with the first-rate cooking and wine and with the comfortable charge. We will surely go back there in a short time.< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Today I went to Poplar to visit my grandparents and wasn’t sure what to have for dinner. We decided to go check out Sabroso Reataurante!!! Best decision I have made in a very long time! The cook really knew what she was doing... We ordered 2 Marisco Molcajetes and I have to say that my plate was freaking amazing!  The portion size alone was exciting but the taste of the food was heavenly!!! I can’t wait to go back. The other part of being there was the cashier was so sweet and explained everything in the plates what they came with and what not. The cook also explained things too it was just a good experience all the way around! The seafood was fresh!!! And there is nowhere in town where I’ve had food like this!!! I definitely would recommend this place to everyone who is wanting seafood prepared Mexican style! Thank you again @Sabrosorestaurante!!!</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Was our second ecape room ever first at Trapped and not what i expected when walking in. Rooms are super immersive very theatrical! They really bring the story to life. Our guide for the night Alex was amazing! He was super helpful and love how he stayed in character. Alex answered any questions we had after and let us know about some cool facts in our room. We booked our next room same night cant wait!!</review>

<Text>Amazing! So fun, so creative! We did Grandma's 100th birthday room; highly recommend it for a family-friendly room. Not scary at all. We had 10 people, 3 adults and 7 kids (7-14 years old) and we escaped with 11 minutes to spare.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNa8nY4R01pTFHcPQKebFLCwl5qMv-cx5Q0ViW2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c32f37aef7d203:0x650b13e829466174<//Gmap_id></record>

Went here on a whim and had a great time with my family. Myles did an excellent job of setting and maintaining the atmosphere of the room we had chosen. Because of his excellent work, we decided to go ahead and do another room the same night. We haven't done the 2nd yet, but later this evening we'll be back and we're excited to see what Grandma's secret is!< /text>

<Review>Place is good. Had fun. We did 2 rooms in one night. We did Pandora's Box and Grandma's Surpirse. I would recommend Grandma's Surprise. Pandora's Box is okay but I felt the room did not live to the potential.<//Review>< gmapID>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Shout out to Alex (cousin Jimmy) for leading a fun experience. Two of us did the “Grandma’s Surprise” escape room and had a lot of fun. The puzzles were unique and surprising at times. We had a few minutes to spare after and Alex explained some of the things that we missed or got stuck on. I recommend for adult duos or small families.< /text>< Name>

I went here as a date with my boyfriend and we did Grandma's Surprise. It was honest the coolest room I had done in a while! The puzzles are a bit more high tech, so there isn't a lot of traditional lock-and-key puzzles, which makes it even more exciting! The bonus puzzles are also such a fun concept! Our GM Taylor was really nice and helpful when giving us hints. Will definitely come back to do the other rooms soon!</Review>

< Review>
I've done 3 escape rooms (Grandma's Surprise, Pandora's Box, and Operation X-13) at this location and wow were they great! Morgan, Taylor, and Hannah are excellent workers who really bring out the magic in the rooms, especially in X-13 (you really feel like you're a swat member!). Also, Grandma's Surprise might seem like it would be scary but it's actually quite quirky and fun. I've also done Lair of the Puzzle Master at Upland and very fun room too. All in all it would be a shame if you didn't visit these rooms, they're great. We got a free shirt for doing a third room!</Review>

<Review>My friend and I did Covid safe escape room at Trapped. It was their newest room Pandora's Box and they weren't kidding about heat, water, and strobe effects. You're not going to get burned but these extra little touches definitely added to the experience. Jordan was great getting us signed in and Alex did a great job as our guide/assistant. Everyone wore masks and plenty of sanitizer to go around.</Review>< pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I had a wonderful time at Trapped! San Dimas. My partner and I did the Pandora's Box escape room, and the puzzles were hard enough to keep us engaged but not so hard that our attempts to solve them were futile. The room itself is a work of art with intricate detail and weather simulations. Alex and Jordan welcomed us into the game, and Jordan was our "guide" throughout the game, and her performance and character were great. I was happy to have Jordan because we needed a few hints, which were helpful. I highly recommend this place for a date night or an escape from the monotony that lockdowns may have caused in life.< /text>< Pics>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Review>Best escape room and Game Master I’ve come across so far. We did operation X13 and out of ~10 I’ve done at different places up and down California, this one was the absolute BEST! Trapped! as a whole  has compelling stories, immersive decorations and staff, a variety of different puzzle types (not just combo locks the whole way through), and creates an experience worth every penny. At the beginning we got some props that came in handy, we found useful items I’ve never come across before, locks and safes I’d never seen before, and it was awesome. If you’re looking for one of the best in the area, this is it in my opinion. There is another location in upland too that was very fun. But X13 at the San dimas location was awesome!

Also of note, Taylor was the BEST Game Master any of us had encountered this far. She was friendly, relatable, and her storytelling/subtle hints were very compelling and immersive. She pushed the experience from a 9/10 to 10/10. Definitely recommend doing a room with her in charge and highly recommend that the company give her a raise.

TL;DR
Awesome experience, worth every cent.
If you want a challenge do Operation X13.
Taylor was a phenomenal Game Master.<//Review><user_name>gabriel martin</user_name></record></dataset><record>

<text>Operation X-13: AWESOME room and the BEST GM I've ever had. This was my second room by Trapped! (which has become my favorite escape room company in SoCal) and it topped the great experience I had already had at the Upland location. The rooms they create are very immersive, thoughtful, and the puzzles are unique and challenging (not all combination locks).
Taylor, our GM, made the experience even better by participating in a compelling and immersive nature. They also dress you in props for this room and gave us all ear pieces so that we could all always hear her in our ear (instead of just one person having a walkie-talkie) which I really appreciated. I've heard good things about the other GM's at this location, but I would request Taylor every time, she was so great!
I've also never been in a room with bonus puzzles and now I wish all escape rooms had them.

Overall- 10/10 experience that I would highly recommend!<//text>< pictures>

Also of note, Taylor was the BEST Game Master any of us had encountered this far. She was friendly, relatable, and her storytelling/subtle hints were very compelling and immersive. She pushed the experience from a 9/10 to 10/10. Definitely recommend doing a room with her in charge and highly recommend that the company give her a raise.

TL;DR
Awesome experience, worth every cent.
If you want a challenge do Operation X13.
Taylor was a phenomenal Game Master.< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Fantastic escape room experience! They went all out with the props, special effects, and all the little details. We were a small group but had an absolute blast thanks to all the effort put in by the staff to make sure we got a full orientation and understood the rules of the game. They went above and beyond by actively monitoring our activity in the room and being proactive in providing the right amount of tips/clues along the way. It’s obvious that the creators thought out everything in the room and were meticulous in weaving together an interactive experience. We will definitely be back for round 2!<//review>< pictures>

We greatly enjoyed our time at Trapped! Thank you to our experience host I apologize I forgot his name but he was hosting our group of teenagers for a birthday party and made the experience more enjoyable. We did X13 room and found it fun and challenging. We will be back thank you.< /text>

Wow wow wow, every single time we’ve booked a room with Trapped I have been blown away! From the incredibly immersive rooms that challenge us even when we think we’ve seen it all, to the outstanding customer service and interaction with the front desk, puzzle masters, “actors” and everyone working at Trapped. This last time we had the true pleasure of working with Jordan and her trainee Kaya. They were kind, enthusiastic and generous in our experience.   They never once made you feel silly for needing clues and made sure you ended the game feeling empowered and thrilled in the game you experienced whether you did or did not escape. I have never been disappointed after completing a room which is why we have now official completed all of the trapped rooms! We CANNOT wait for their new room to open very soon! Give Trapped a try - you will soon be addicted like we are! Thank you Trapped for always being the perfect night out! And thank you Jordan and Kaya for making our experience so magical and the best yet!!!< /Text>

I am a big fan of escape rooms. This is my 7th one done and I loved it. The one we did was Pandora's Box. It was challenging enough to get my groups brains spinning but we were able to escape with some time to spare.

Big shout-out to Taylor. She was a great hostess and stayed well in character throughout our game. You rock Taylor!!!<//Text>

<Text>This place is awesome! I've done many, many, mannnny escape rooms, so I've seen my fair share of escape rooms, but these rank near the top of my list. They are complex, fun, and extremely well themed. The staff is also wonderful.

Fantastic time. Our group
Pandora's box escape room and it was so well thought out. The staff is absolutely killin it! Well received at the door, Taylor actually took the time to keep a friendly conversation going before and after the room, made sure to answer all our questions. A small detail that made a huge  impact on our experience too was the fact that she was role playing as she communicated and dropped hints for us as we did the room. Can not stress how fun it was.< /Text>

Completed all of the rooms here! They were all great but our personal favorites were Grandma's Surprise and Pandora's Box! Grandma's Surprise was... Surprising for sure. Pandora's Box was an amazing and intense experience. Our game master was Taylor; she was super friendly and great at staying in character as usual (She hosted Down the Rabbit Hole for us at the Upland location)!<//review>

<Review>The experience here was great! It was my first time doing an escape room (we did the pandoras box) and I couldn't have been any more satisfied. The escape room was an over all challenge but not impossible. In other words it was a perfect balance ! I would also like to pay tribute to the employees here. They have an over all positive vibe and their theatrics were amazing! A specific employee Taylor was really kind and not shy to play her part as a character though out our escape room adventure ! They definitely make this a fun immersive experience and I would highly recommend any family/group of friends to try this out!< /Review>< resp>

Our group of 5 had such a fun time here! I've been to a few rooms but 3 of us had never done it before and were made to feel super welcome. I think the best part of the experience was Taylor! She did an excellent acting job and made the room memorable. Count yourself lucky if she's your game master.<//Review>

Did the Pandora's Box with a group of 4. None of us have done an Escape Room before.
Taylor did a great job introducing us to the concept of it and played the character well. Will definitely be back to do more.</review>

I did Pandora's Box here at San Dimas, and it was extremely immersive! There was a cool rain effect, a heater for certain puzzle, etc. We were able to pass the room with only 2 people and 15 minutes still on the clock. Our wonderful gamemaster Morgan, helped immerse us in this escape room with her storytelling and was really helpful after the game in explaining how some of the puzzles worked. She was overall a wonderful person!</Text>

We had an Awesome time! This was our first escape room experience for 2 of the 3 of us. The Trapped Escape Room staff was great and made  us feel comfortable! Operation X-13 was challenging but we completed our mission with 1 minute, 9 seconds left... Great teamwork!
Thank you for an AmaZinG and Fun Experience! We will definitely be back again!< /review>

<Text>I love this escape room company! I've been to several of their rooms at 2 locations and each one is planned out very well. The design is  thoughtful and the game play is exciting, fun and rewarding. The rooms I've played are all family friendly but difficult enough to stump a group of adults! I like that they are focused on giving the customers a good experience. I need them to design more rooms, I'm almost through them all! 😁</Text>< pics>

We visited Trapped! Upland on 1/26 for a new and different activity for my son's birthday. We did Sector 13 as our first ever escape room and it was a blast! The room was well thought out and had great and challenging puzzles! Our whole group loved it! We loved it so much we returned the next day and ended up doing Puzzle Master and Down the Rabbit Hole!! We escaped all three!!! It was a great way to spend a birthday weekend! Also really impressed by all the staff! Everyone we talked to and interacted with was so friendly and nice! Thank you for a super fun experience! We're now hooked on Escape rooms and can't wait to do more!!!< /review>

Played both their Grandma's Surprise and Operation: X-13 rooms and loved them both. Trapped is one of my favorite escape room companies since they produce immersive and fun-filled rooms. The GMs were very attentive and very in-character which is always a plus. You will have no trouble with parking here.</Review>

This was our second escape room.  I was very happy to find another non-horror room suitable for my kids.  We did "Operation: X-13" and it was nothing short of amazing, very complicated and well thought out puzzles.  It is obvious that the creators of the TRAPPED rooms love what they do and go to great lengths to ensure that their visitors have a great experience ... We LOVED it.  Now we're hooked even more.< /text>

This escape room was one of my favorite ones my friends and I have done so far and we go all over Southern California.

Room: Operation X-13 was an engaging room that really gave an immersive experience due to the creativity of the puzzles, and our game keeper Daphne who made the escape room so much better. Everything in the room was perfect in detail and there were puzzles we had to solve I have not seen elsewhere. Don’t want to spoil any of the puzzles but we did really love this room!

Service: Our group could tell how passionate the team members here were about the rooms they had and it was unique to hear that all of the rooms they have are connected to each other like a story line! If we’re in the area again we’d definitely try the others.

Parking: Parking was super easy to find and plenty of space available. As someone who’s been to escape rooms in LA this really is important since being late can really cut off from your experience and be a Debbie downer if it’s because of parking.

Overall I’d highly recommend trying this room before doing the sequel to the room which is located in their Upland location.<//text>

<text>Me and some buddies came in and solved our booked puzzle with time to spare. We were so amped when we finished, we asked if we could do another and got a same-day discount on the second one. Great experience, we loved the rooms. They are very well designed and very fun to solve. 10/10</text>< Pictures>

<Resp>None</Resp><pictures>None<//pictures><review>Trapped has the best escape rooms. This was my first time at the San Dimas location and we did the Grandma’s surprise room. From the beginning it was fast pace.  There were 7 of us and we worked in teams to finish. It was a great room. I love the theming of the puzzles and the theming if the room. They always go together and they are fun. I would highly recommend all the Trapped escape rooms. This room and Down the Rabbit hole are by far my favorite and I have done close to 20 rooms. Thank you making it a fun interactive game!</review></record></dataset><record>

Loved this escape room! This would be my 15th one.  It was very immersive and the room had enough puzzles that kept 3 of us busy the whole time!  What I liked most about this compared to other escape rooms was that the story really matched what we were doing--it didn't seem forced. Plus, they had a very immersive way of providing clues! Loved it! Can't wait to go again. :)< /Review>

<Text>Just the one room here for now, the mission-based X-13, which worked well with four people. Another game is coming in a few months. X-13 had thought-out set design, and was a fully immersive game through the gamemaster participation and types of puzzles. Hints were clever and appropriate, not just giveaways. Puzzles made clever use of many kinds of technology, some of which I've never before seen in escape rooms. Our gamemaster Daphne was great, and integral to our success.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c32f37aef7d203:0x650b13e829466174</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My buddies and I are quickly becoming connoisseurs of escape rooms.  Our favorite room, hands down, is at Trapped in Upland--Sector 13.  Now Trapped in San Dimas has opened up a prequel to Sector 13 called Operation: X-13.  The Trapped in San Dimas room is pheonmenal!  We loved it.  We still call Sector 13 our favorite, but Operation: X-13 is a close second.  Trapped in Upland has been one of the my favorite escape room experiences and Trapped in San Dimas lives up to my expectations.  Trapped has scored again.  If you've never done an escape room or you've done a bunch, you will love Trapped San Dimas.< /Review>

Alex from trapped was awesome! We did the grandma's secret room and it was so much fun.

Also I have been battling claustrophobia for year and this place was so entertaining i felt at ease the whole time; excited even!

We ended up solving the room just in time and felt pretty great about it. Grandma's room was a great start, but we are definitely coming back for pandora's box!< /Review>

<rating>3</rating><text>Been here before to get a battery.  Decent service but hard to get someone to answer the phone sometimes. Recently, I tried calling and wanted to see if they were open but nobody answered so I purchased a battery from O'Reilly auto parts. I didn't want to drive over to see if they were open only to find out they were closed, waste of time and gas so I just ate the cost around the corner at O'Reilly and got a warranty.  It was a Thursday afternoon around 12:45pm.  No biggie, good service but a message on the phone could help me decide.  But they have good used and new batteries and will drop in a battery for you if you buy one from them.< /text>< Pics>

This place is great,  there not new batteries but I have been there a few times. They have a 6 month guarantee.  He will check the battery you are bringing in if it will hold a charge and if it does he will tell you that your battery good so it's more likely something else.< /Review>

Very bad service , I got a battery from this tweaked out sales person at the shop about a month ago he didn’t write the date on the recipe I took the battery back since my 6 months hasn’t expired for the warranty and this tweeker came up saying that that was a old recipe that he couldn’t give me the warranty .< /review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I have bought batteries for my cars for so many years that I no longer remember. And I always return for their prices and excellent service, not everyone has the power to buy a new battery. And this place offers the opportunity to acquire a good battery used at a good price and with guarantee. I recommend it. Check for yourself the good service

<Review>Excellent service and pricing! Will and the crew were patient with all my questions and a pleasure to do business with. Will even called me to give me regular updates on the shipping status of my new top. It was professionally installed and looks great. Top notch experience from start to finish!<//Review>< user_name>

I went in not knowing much of what I wanted.  The staff there was amazing and helped me compare models next to each other. The pricing was fair but expected for a custom cover.

Thank you Brandon, I'll definitely be returning.</review>

I made an appointment for this morning , last Thursday. with Brandon to reseal the windows of my camper shell shell.

I passed up on work to get it done because its suppose to rain Thursday.

During my initial conversation I told Brandon I would need the truck to run errands while they re seal the windows. He said is will be fine

He quotes me 40$ for parts $15 for glue & 120 for labor

This morning when I showed up he acted as if me needing the truck was shocking and inconvenient

After they took my truck in and inspected Brandon cane back out and asked me what windows need to be resealed

I told him just like I told him when I made the appointment..."all of them"

He left.. came back 15 minutes later and asked me if I could tell him what windows or areas were leaking

Wow!! Really!! I'm a 37 year old man and your try to hustle me??

I immediately realized that they were.not trying to reseal all of my windows  but instead they were going to try to seal small are
as to save them time, labor and material

This does not help me. it's not what I was willing to pay them to do. In fact it make.my life worse because I would have paid expecting me new deals and had water all of my tools and equipment costing me soooooo much more Money

So instead of let them take my money and cheat me I am going to do it myself.

I really dont know how this company has stayed around for 40 years and as I am building a company and interacting with my riverside community I would never be so crooked.  I provided extra service, for lowers prices and never tried to miss lead a client.

I will never stop telling my clients and my neighbors about my experience  at fuller trucks on indiana in riverside. This is just the start<//review>

< review>
Aubrey was amazingly helpful!  She really knows her stuff.  She helped us price out everything we would need for our new work truck to get us rolling efficiantly.  The pricing of many of their items was below what we were able to find elsewhere, even online.< /review>

I spent a lot of money with them and after they got my money from me, they didn’t treat me well when I had issues. I wouldn’t trust them with another purchase.</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I bought a backflip mx4 bed cover recently. Everything from the owner, installer, and cashier was perfect. All 3 workers were super professional and nice. You can tell they are happy workers since they give their full attention to customers and genuinely smile. Really great customer service. I made an appointment at 10am and they were waiting for me ready to install and I was done in 1 hour as promised.<//Text>< pictures>

12501 Burbank blvd Domino's Pizza have employees/managers that don't really know how to make a pizza that a customer ORDERS. I don't know how many times I've asked time and time again for ORIGINAL, THICK CRUST and they always give me THIN!! Are all of them hard of hearing or don't know how to play a pizza with thick crust. I mean that should be fairly easy but apparently it's the hardest thing in the world for them. Every. Single. Time. Maybe 3 times they were able to get my order correctly - compared to the hundreds of times I order from them. I wish there were other dominos around my area (a compotent one at that) but unfortunately, this is what I'm left to deal with - it's only 3 mins from my house. I love Domino's, I think they have the best pizza or at least a close second to Papa John's but the workers here have really got to get better at listening to the customers AND CORRECTLY make their pizza without them leaving dissatisfied. This constant occurrence I never have with any other pizza places. Sad. Frustrating. Unacceptable.<//Text>

Fun place to eat at! They do have places to eat where you can sit! The only problem is that you have to pay for the ranch. Like why??? Aside from that the food is really yummy!< /Text>

We had dinner here and we were very impressed our server was very friendly, attentive and gave us some great suggestions.
Because we hadn’t been before we received a complimentary starter to share which was really nice.
Our meal was really nice and we didn’t wait to long and even though we were full we were glad we tried the desserts as they were really nice we had key lime pie and a beautiful vanilla pudding with ice cream which was the best I have ever had.
We highly recommended this place for singles, couples or families.</text>

Fast and delicious. Not a fan of the thin crust here but that is a personal preference. Stick to the original crust.< /Text>

<Text>I have been a Dominos customer for years and thought they had pretty good customer service until tonight. So the last couple of times I ordered (delivery), they have forgotten the extra $ garlic sauce that I get with my Parmesan bread twists. The last time it happened, I caught it and told the driver and he said to call the store manager the next time I order and I would get free Parmesan twists, which was very reasonable. I called tonight and the woman on the phone said, “There’s no note about that on your profile. I can’t do anything for you.” I was shocked, especially since this is the business with all the commercials saying they make things right when a customer’s order is wrong. Pfft!

After that, she was asking about tonight’s order, and I told her I didn’t want to continue with the order, I just wanted this problem fixed. And  guess what: she hung up on me! I work in customer service myself and would never treat someone like this. I think I may have to find a new pizza place after this</Text><rating>1< /rating>< gmap_id>

<text>Man best Domino's ever. I've sworn off chain pizza due to the disappointment every time. But young kids have the taste buds of well...kids. They wanted Domino's and I'm the cool uncle so here we are.

Great pizza got the 5.99 deal due to everyone having different preference. Crust was good not super salty how it was before nice hint of garlic toppings tasted decent. Sauce was sweet but it's chain pizza. All in all the kids loved it and I ate a couple slices.<//text>< Pictures>

I ordered Penne veggie today.  Geez it is so good... super yummy.  I asked for green pepper, tomatoes, halapeno and spinach. Delivery came so fast.  Thanks so much, I don’t even want to go back to my PC to work here at home, lol.  Just want to rest but that’s not the choice.  Awesome veggie penne with Alfredo sauce.  Thanks.

Incredible service, fantastic food and super speedy delivery.

Anthony prepared our food, and it was absolute perfection! Not to mention, his customer service and amazing phone manners were beyond excellent.

Mokhim delivered our food before the 29 minute estimate. He also delivered our previous order. Obviously, he is memorable. He is polite, friendly and exceedingly professional! If he's not their best delivery person, I look forward to seeing who is. We adore him!

Incredibly impressed.
Finally, simple to order, fast delivery pizza that's worth its price!<//Review><response>None< /response></record>

<Text>First couldn't find my order, then after I left they found it and made it, didn't bother to tell me. I found my order by searching it in the app and called, they told me they made the pizza for me, 20 minutes before and they made it wrong.  I asked them to make the pizza I ordered and they reluctantly said fine.  I returned to pick up my pizza, which was not what I ordered...and cold.  If you like Dominos, good for you, but Avoid this location.<//Text>< Date>

Great tasty pizza and wings. You can never go wrong ordering from Domino's. Try ordering from the 5.99 deals.< /Text>

<text>I was happy that a new branch opened near my house but the price difference is ridiculous compared to the other branch i used to order from.  plus the  coupons they offer you don't realy save from
And if i want to order a delivery i am forced to order from them because dominos policy won't allow other branch the cheper one to deliver for our area because this branch really my recommendation it eathet i can order a delivery from any branch near me or you unify the prices and coupons online so when i want to order and forced on that branch will not pay double the price.....< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

This is the second time I'm ordering carry out at this location and both times they didn't have my order ready on time. Both times I was told 10-15 minutes for my two medium pizzas and despite me arriving 30 mins after my call, they still told me 5 minutes. First time they somehow entirely skipped my order and never started it until I showed up. Today I showed up half hour after order was placed and they say "5 more minutes". That 5 minutes turned to 10. They should be be honest with their promised times. I'd rather have them tell me 30 minutes and my food being ready then than to have to wait longer when I arrive thinking it's ready.

They also have bugs inside their soda refrigerators</Review>

Pleasant Hill isn't one of my favorite East Bay towns but this is one of my favorite Off the Grid locations because the area is so clean, spacious and well maintained. Ahn the Go is my favorite regular truck for sweet and savory garlicky noodles with varying toppings. There is always beer and ice cream of some sort. Usually options for lobster rolls, falafel and BBQ. Free parking!</text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Great variety in food trucks. Friendly crowds with lots of small children & dogs on leashes that make the atmosphere lively. If you get here early enough Adirondack Chairs are available. Live music is eclectic and not too loud. One of my favorite things to do on a Wednesday evening.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Nothing looked good to be honest, the food trucks need to step their game up! The crowd consist of white people no offense so anything will pass as delicious to the crowd.</Review>

<text>Food is generally good for fast food, but prices are outrageous so value for money is in the pit. A family of four can have a decent meal at a real restaurant for less. Certainly a fun treat and evening, not something to do every week in my book.</text>< Rate>

Food trucks rotate but there's always good music, friendly and polite staff, and awesome food. Bring your whole family for good bonding time and feel free to bring fido! Great place to lounge with friends too.<//review>

Great venue, fun community gathering,  family friendly, good variety on the food trucks, lots of space on the lawn, but it can get crowded. Bring chairs or a blanket, shade for kids, hats, and sun screen.</Review>

Had an order of Sandwico del Mundo's Vegan Empanadas (~$7): deep-fried breaded treats stuffed with seasonal veggies, tofu, chipotle corn masa, arugula, & pico de gallo.  Also had an order of (Vegan) Tots from Drewski's Hot Rod Kitchen (~$4): crispy tater tots (potato) cooked in olive oil & seasoned with rosemary.  Food was delicious, staff was agile, and the ambiance was... well... mobile!< /review>

Service was slow as we waited over a hour to get our food, the beans were watery and tables dirty. This day was not one of their best as the waitresses were asking people who ordered what because they didn't know what tables the food was for.</review>

The Campechana was fat with oyster and shrimp and what ever else was there. The price for me was a bit steep at $17 for the large but worth every centavo!!! The medium Shrimp cocktail had a generous amount of large shrimp served up Goldilocks style... not to spicy and not to much lime. The bar section was ghost town status. I almost served my self. Discouraged and hungry I left  thirsty<//Text>

The food isn't terrible if you get what you order. Well, not the Caldo... (Burned, dry meat, whole cabbage, whole potatoes floating in flavorless liquid. Am I supposed to cut it up myself?!). Today, we forgot and ordered work lunch again (our fault- should have learned the first time). We previously asked for 1 order (1 parradilla). Last time it came with a large serving of meat and 3 quesadillas, beans, etc. "serves 2" (it's enough for 3). They forgot our drinks, oh well. So this time we ordered 3 parradillas (3 orders) and got the same 1. We called to tell them they forgot 2 orders, and they yelled at us for 10 minutes! This time we'll remember. Don't eat at Jalisco's!<//review>

<Name>Catherine A. Montgomery</Name><text>Eclectic decor (borrowing from both Hindhu and Mexican cultures), this is a vibrant, friendly, artsy place with great service, good food and fantastic ambiance! Authentic Mexican food (fresh daily), full service bar and "Best MARGARITAS in town".

The menu consists of appetizers (including quesadilla, chicken wings and french fries), soups, salads, burritos, hamburgers, a good variety of specialty plates, seafood and breakfast. There is something for every one here and if they have the ingredients, they are willing to add whatever ingredient you may fancy.

This seems to have a family element during day, but there is a full service bar with piped in music and DJ on weekends. It has good feel to it, colorful and inviting.

If I am in this area again, it will be a place to stop for quick bite, cocktail or to share a meal (did I mention generous portions? A meal can feed 2, maybe 3 depending on how hungry you are) You must try the shrimp cocktail - topped with avocado and blended with cucumbers onions tomatoes and a very tasty tomato based sauce (you can share this with a friend, too).</text>< user_id>

Good Mexican food. Not my favorite for the valley but it's good. A plus is they do have a salsa bar with really various good salsa. If you ask they have hotter hot sauce in the back. A plus plus they have the best guacamole I've had in a long time. So, if I was rating just salsa and guacamole they would get a 5+. The rest was really good just not my best of the best.</Review>

I stopped going here several years ago because the food had changed.  Today we decided to try it one more time. It was very good! I'm so happy because it was a favorite place for us. It's back on the favorite list again. Service was excellent too.< /Text>

<gmapID>0x80d760caecf2cc6b:0x51e11d68013cd8ee< /gmapID><text>Try the Pollo Asado (grilled chicken) tacos. I always order them plain with avocado slices on the side and cilantro. This way I can add the Salsa I like (Salsa Tatamada). It comes with two tortillas so I separate them and make a giant taco. It's delicious, affordable, and healthier than anything fried. So if you're looking for a healthier option while still being able to enjoy delicious Mexican food, then this is a great choice. Staff is always welcoming and friendly. Enjoy!</text>< name>

The tacos I ordered from there were good but the service is what kinda got to me. I was at the bar with a friend and took forever to have someone take our order and get us some drinks. We were the only two at the bar by the way. The bartender would leave and show up about every 10 minutes. The place was not busy either.<//text>

Hadn't been here in a couple of years.  Ordered a carne asada burrito and an egg, bean and bacon burrito. Unfortunately they were not as good as before.  Carne asada lacked it's usual good flavor and even my breakfast burrito wasn't very good.  The bacon was thick, undercooked and rather tough.  I just tossed it.  So sad....<//review>

<review>Didn’t want to give a refund after I didn’t want my food that I didn’t order it with. It had too much grease at the top and through out. It stained my fingers and didn’t wash off. But worst of all my food had hairs all over it. It is so expensive but in my option they deserve 0 stars. Bad service ever. Never going back to that place ever again.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Food was edible, initially went for street taco style.  Specifically asked for pinto beans and was severed refried beans.  10 minutes waiting for drinks with sever and a different server took order...had to ask original server for assistance.  No personal interest on our food and/or drinks.  Literally had get up ask for extra chips and sasla.  TV sports on, plus!
Mexican music in the background and Mariachi guy playing, not so much.  Prices fair.  Tacos full of meat that had flavor with the avacado sauce and salsa that I added.  Overall, would go back, however expect better service.  Cold mug beers served, best attribute to this bar!</text>

<Review>I had the enchilada plate with mole.  The mole did not hit the spot.  But the worst is going into the bathroom with soiled toilet paper on the floor and a soap that does not produce a lather.  How are employees effectively washing their hands?<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

The combination plates are also delicious, my favorite is combination 4 if I am not mistaken, a taco,  enchilada, and tostada, you can choose between cheese or beef. They started to close at 2:00 am (bar area) which is awesome.  New bar tender and music. I can't forget the staff, super friendly.  We go there at least 3 to 4 times in a month on the weekends.< /review><gmapID>0x80d760caecf2cc6b:0x51e11d68013cd8ee<//gmapID><response>None</response>< Name>

Food is delicious, sadly there are two glaring problems when visiting, there isn't enough parking sometimes, and the staff can sometimes be too passive; I understand a friendly work environment, but customers should always come first.<//Review>

Came as part of a party of 11 to celebrate a family bday. Staff was friendly, attentive, and quick. Restaurant was clean. Had a live music act (guitar/voice). Had Chile rellenos plate and tried a beef enchilada. Chile rellenos are light , not greasy, but also not too heavy in flavor unfortunately. Beans were very good. Beef enchilada was tasty. Overall a good experience.<//Text>

<text>Don't know if it was just bad timing but majority of my food was fine, my problem was the amount of time it took to be tended by the waitress, the aquachilles weren't the slightest bit of hot. The waitress returned them to the kitchen and brought the same ones back with a little extra added chilli, after about a 30 minute wait the aguachilles still were not satisfactory. My girlfriend did the talking, the waitress wouldn't acknowledge me.....smh may try going back another day...< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Food was great. Service wasn't. The dining room, which is pretty big, was almost empty with the guess scattered around. Only one server was working on this day so it was very hard to get her attention.</review>

<Text>Food and service ok. But prices wow outrageous...way too high, and wanted to spicy up my food and for a jalapeno toreado no other option then an whole order for 3.50 what seriously? Break fast too expensive!!!! Eggs pancakea and a strip of bacon 10.99.
Im serious when Insee the menu I wanted to walk out.
But w respect I ordered and will not be back. Food wasnt as great to pay such high menu prices.< /Text>< Pictures>
