This creamery was pretty busy with an after lunch rush on Saturday, that being said after ordering my friends and I got our ice cream about half an hour later. Granted the ice cream is made/ prepared to order and the presentation, taste, and texture was nice. It's an interesting idea but to play around with an industry that typically has fast food timing when it comes to the end result the wait doesn't seem to justify the product. I also happened to choose two flavors on their menu that weren't available so I went with my third option, a take on strawberries and cream, The Owen Experiment.</Text>

As someone who can't consume dairy and has a tree nut allergy, the staff at Atomic Creamery went above and beyond with their product and my order! Never have I had such creamy, unique flavors in a non-dairy ice cream! I highly recommend the strawberry, and even my dairy eating friends complimented how similar the taste was to real ice cream. Their nationwide delivery was a breeze and I will be ordering again soon! Thank you!<//review>

If you want to be the dude that everyone remembers from at your friend's birthday party, bring several tubs of these ice cream there. I repeat, several tubs, and not pints, QUARTS! Bring the quarts! Saffron pistachio is a lady killer (bring 2), rose water ginger is equally delish, also mango. So creamy, and you won't settle on just one. Sharing is caring guys.<//review>

The taste and texture of this creamery is far different than any other! Exquisitely created, I ordered the Bean Mi Vietnamese coffee and was not let down. It tastes like the real thing but better; the right amount of creamy, sweetness, and taste. My boyfriend also tried the cookies n cream, and he absolutely loved it as well. Although it is pricy, the quality of the desserts are so worth it, would come here again.</review>

Atomic Creamery has the best strawberry ice cream I've ever had. Flavor and texture is perfect. The owners and staff super friendly too. They even have a doggy bowl for your pups out front. Right in front of the parking structure so it's easy access. Can't wait to come back!< /Text>

< Review>
i was a little disappointed by this ice cream spot after reading the reviews about exotic flavors. most flavors are generic- chocolate varieties, cheesecake of some sort, vanillas, your typical ice cream flavors which were just ok. they had four exotic flavors consisting of rosewater when i visited- which were great (only because i love flowery tasting ice cream in general) i got the orange blossom ice cream (a flowery ice cream not fruity) which was better in a mashti sandwich. my bf got the rosewater saffron which was also good. however, for the drive and destination location, i can't say their flowery ice cream (nor their normal flavors) even compares to some other i've had at ici, bi-rite or even carmela's. it's also on the pricey side given atmosphere and portions. i wouldn't go back given the other choices in the city.< /Review>

<Review>The only ice cream I have ever become addicted to. The strawberry is fantastic can't wait to go back for another cone. You may need to wait for it to be made but it is well worth the wait. It is fresh and creamy with chunks of frozen fresh strawberries. I am over 80 so I am speaking from years of experience that goes back to when people made their own ice cream.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>We stopped in here yesterday and got a couple scoops in the afternoon. Our timing was right because demands was so high during the heat wave that they actually ran out! I chatted with the gentleman running the place after he closed the doors - they even ordered extra dairy this weekend in anticipation of the extra business, but still didn't have enough! After having a scoop or two, I can see why. Everything is fresh and organic, the ice cream is smooth and the flavors are rich. I had the Nutella-flavored ice cream, and my +1 had a vanilla/cake mix called AB2. Both were fantastic. The lettuce is pretty reasonable for gourmet ice cream at Fashion Island. Plus, the business is veteran owned, and they offer discounts to active service military and first responders. What's not to like?<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1597675361005, 'text': 'Thank you'}< /response>< GmapID>

<text>With an urban edge, a touch of millennial sass, and, of course, the heavenly flair of homespun-made-with-love ice cream, this place hit the mark on several levels.I tried the double smidge of chocolate sorbet and mint chip. My partner in crime had the double smidge of the Papanasi and Cantuccini. All were superb. We also had a fresh cup of their pour over coffee.< /text></record>

Walked in 1st visit. Small frontage order area, register to the right small bit of counter seating to the left. Kind of like a Creamisry with fresher ingredients. The concept is to use top notch ingredients and create ice cream using the nitrogen process. It's an old chemistry class trick that when done right using their custom machines, makes very smooth ice cream. Ok, regarding the smoothness, straight up I'd be back in a heartbeat for the product. As for price the website looks like no update since March 2018 (?) We were able to order the Lil Bites (?) maybe used to be Lil Scientists. This is a limited menu of smaller sized, but less expensive choices @ 4.50$/ea. This choice was a value and as a dinner dessert plenty for portion size. A few downsides... We ordered thinking we were first to be served. With only two ice cream machines in use, there were actually two orders ahead of us. We didn't want to seem impatient, but our order was ready 20+ minutes after ring up. Be cautious if you are going to a movie, etc. There was what looked like three young staff and one Supervisor/Mgr on shift to make orders. With orders coming in I did not see the machine bowls filled, churning out ice cream. I have no clue what wait time is when they have a rush but I'm sure it's more than 20+ minutes. There was the usual pop music medium volume in the store. Hip n cool, yes, but bummer the staff was shouting over the combo of music and the air blasts the nitrogen made as it hit the mixing bowl. I didn't care to much for one employee discussing work hours and employee habits while making the ice cream. As first time customers, I thought the register/counter person could have been more helpful or friendly to us. The girl at the "finishing" station was moving a bit slow compared to back service restuarant people I've worked with. Again as commented only one machine of two was used on average, sometimes two. Magically, they did get orders out in a roughly smooth operation. There was a looseness to the group for example a woman came in and just waited at the register for service for quite some time before being noticed. The place was very clean as expected. A little bit of old ice cream and toppings floating in the dipper wells. I did notice an employee rinsing blades in the dipper wells instead of being sanitized in the sink. Overall an average experience with very good ice cream. I can see this is a good product by people with good intentions. FYI, I've managed and sold ice cream, not easy. My intent here is not to anonymously rip on a store. I hope they resolve the output issue to make more product faster but still keep quality. Also, I know it's a challenge to manage kids getting minimum wage, but they owe the company to represent the product and encourage people to come back. Leasing at Fashion Island is not cheap. Oh and its AUG 2018, keeping websites current is extra work on top of 14 hour days, I know I've worked them. But current info sells the awesome fresh ingredient model to a wider group of people for you... Thank you kindly for the great ice cream tonight.<//review>

TERRIBLE experience. Staff and manager are liars. Walked in at 8:45 and they refused to serve us ice cream even though they close at 9. There were other customers leaving with fresh ice cream and the stores doors were wide open. There was no sign of closing any time soon as customers were still inside eating their fresh ice cream. When asked for clarification on the store hours policy the employees walked away & rolled their eyes at us. Then the owner came out and continued to lie about the store hours and treating us incredibly rudely. We were visiting from out of town and celebrating and it ruined the night. We ended up going to Whole Foods and had a wonderful experience.< /Text>

We are only required to be open the hours of the mall. Fashion Island summer  hours changed on 28June to 8PM and we typically try to stay open an hour later on Friday/ Saturday and Sunday.  I am not quite sure how you think you are justified to call my employees and myself lairs when I did not speak to you nor have any interaction with you. We are a veteran owned and operated store, not a franchise but our own concept store and had someone in your party called to let us know you were coming we would have stayed open... we do this for groups and have even taken phone orders.

Ice cream is made fresh with liquid nitrogen. It's very creamy and rich. Cute atomic age theming.< /Text>

Walked in tonight well before closing and was very rudely treated not only staff but the manager. Disappointed because it's an adorable spot. They were not honest and very unprofessional in their approach to turning us away. They completely lost a chance to go above and beyond with their customer service and actually lost clients today.</Text>

< Review>
The most amazing ice cream in the world!  They use liquid nitrogen to make all of their ice cream and all the ingredients are super fresh.  My favorite is the Owen Experiment.</Review>

<text>Extremely rude. I asked before ordering what is used to make the ice cream die to dietary requirements and was told just a type of plant protein milk which they showed me the bottle of. Whilst they were making it I seen them add some chocolate syrup and asked what was in it. There were some ingredients in which I could not eat. So I asked for a refund explaining that I was told nothing else would be used. The staff I asked, who seemed to be manager or owner, for a refund was extremely rude and kept saying there is nothing in it which can cause issues even though o repeatedly said I have been told by my Dr that I could not eat that ingredient.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

New playgrounds are amazing. Thank you Santa Maria for thinking of this side of the town. I've been going here since I was a little girl and now my kids get to enjoy this park. Private bathroom is so much better than the portapotties and different playgrounds for different ages was a great idea. Benches for sitting and even the way it was laid out all different. Much appreciated! 5 stars.<//text>

So I give them my highest rating due to them giving me great  service at a good price. they are taking me to my goal of upgrading my ride. I have a 2014 jetta TDI. While others didnt want to take on my projects they did and was cheaper then others. what I did was buy window tint, and upgrades healights. They will do most things. I highly recommended them. the best part is they give good prices, good service and usually same day.< /Text>

I took my car in for some new tires and rims as well as a leveling kit and 1) my tires were full of dirt which shouldn’t be because they are “new” and the rims were already scratched up. They also do not know how to install a leveling kit properly since my car’s steering is very off now, it was perfectly fine before I took it in and now it wont steer properly. I talked to the owner/manager and all he said was that they don’t offer warranty on their installation of products</Text>

<Text>If I could give this business negative stars I would, but since I can’t I’ll share my experience with you. My husband and I went into audio sport looking for 1 sub and an amp and some tint for our new car. When we got in there the guy at counter upsold us and said we should get two subs an amp and door speakers along with tint. My husband asked if what he was trying to sell would work in our car. He said absolutely. We left and later that day ( after hours ) went back and got in the car.....the system sounded terrible. It would cut out if you would turn the volume up past 15. I got out and told the guys that were working on the car that they needed to  fix it. After several eye rolls they got into the car and tweaked the amp and it sounded fine so we left. The next morning I got into the car, turned the stereo up and it cut out again. I took the car back. The guys said it sounded fine to them but when I turned it up they heard it cut out, they kept turning the amp down so it wouldn’t cut out but the base was minimal. Definitely not how two 12” sub, tweeters and door speakers should sound. I left and about a week later the same thing happened. I went back they said the battery in our car was not strong enough to power the equipment we had. Why weren’t we told that from the beginning? We went and bought a battery.....it did not fix the problem. We recorded him saying the battery would fix the issue. The guys in the shop took the car back in and an hour later came out and said it was a power issue now and they installed new power cable. They said that if we really want the subs to work how we want them to that we needed to purchase a whole new deck. Mind you we were told in the very beginning this equipment would be fine with what we already have. The overall experience of this company as a whole was terrible. The customer service was ridiculous. I was given dirty looks, eye rolls etc. Now months later the speakers go in and out from one side to the other. At this point we will be contacting the BBB and taking this business to court.< /Text><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dbf3614b43c3c3:0x896508ccd51232b1<//GmapID><date>1589323701963< /date>< rating>

Called and got an appointment for window tint. Told them year make and model and they gave me a price and appointment time. Took off work and got a ride, but when I talked to the guy up front he had no idea about the appointment and said the price was double. So now I'm out money from work and gas money for the ride and no tint.</Text>

Small car audio business that has their stuff together! They work fast, do quality work, and don't over price things. I got a simple Line Out converter installed and my Cadillacs Active Noise Cancellation(ANC) disabled so that I could install my own subs. Only cost me $125 and I was out the door in less than 30min. For reference, EVERY car audio place I called to do this job wanted $200+ and sounded annoyed that all I wanted was an LOC installed. These guys had zero problems and even told me, when I finish installing my subs to come back if i have any trouble and they'd gladly help. I will definitely be back for my next installation on my girlfriends car and will probably just pay for them to do everything because they've earned my trust and business.</Text>

<review>Sean is very friendly and helpful. I’ve gotten two of my cars tinted here. I was a walk in, and was in and out in a reasonable time. The prices are fair and competitive. The tint work was very professional. I would not have brought my second car in for another tint job if the work wasn’t good. Overall I’ve had a good experience with Sean, and would definitely recommend this place.<//review>< Pictures>

0 stars!!! Never going here again!!! Went in to get 2 kits for my radio and 1 kit was missing a piece but 2 of a same part. Then denied it when I went there and told me they would charge me $75! To install.. later on they lowered it to $15 because they knew we could've installed it on our own if they had given us a GOOD PART ! They also did not want to tell me what the issue was after I asked..</Text>

They marked me up and had me pay 800 for stuff that I found in the internet for 200. I understand parts and labor but when I called and asked they stood solid behind the no refund policy. This place is trash they just want to take your money.< /review>

Look i think this place is great... i've bought a lot of things from rims tires more tires stereo decks wireless headphones and i was happy with my purchases. i see a lot of people complaining in their reviews but i have never had a problem i would give this place 5 stars due too the fact that the more i go back the better the pricing gets try being a loyal customer and stop expecting the world on your first trip or try installing thing by yourself i mean i do i buy the parts and do my own work if its something i need help with they help me....its not a bad place.</text>

< Review>
Not worth your time. I went here the other day for car stereo installation the guy told me it would take 2 hours to install the stereo and I was there for 5 hours. Just waiting for the installation and the guy even got mad when all I did was ask a few questions. Then once all that was over I got the stereo installed it wasn't even well installed correctly. For what I paid around 150 for the installation I hoping at least the job to be done good. The stereo was all crooked, and when I  turned on the AC the stereo turned off he even wanted to charge me more to fix these problems. Seriously makes me wonder what did I pay for?an installation or for the guy to f up my car. Not worth your time and money. Never coming here again. 0 stars out of 5< /Review>

They tinted my windows in a dirty environment and/or didn't clean the windows that they charged me to clean. Spots everywhere. Tint not cut to fit window. Looks cheesy on my Mustang. Really not cool. This isn't my first tint job. Major disappointment. The only reason I got the tint done in the first place is because I have melanoma. Stage 3. I've become terrified of the sun. Thanks for adding to my stress ... once again, audiosport. My bad. 2nd time, shame on me.< /review>

<Review>Repeat customer here. I've had 3 vehicles' windows tinted by them. They do a good job, for a fair price. I'm going back, to have them do some stereo upgrades next. OBTW, I don't usually bother with leaving feedback, but apparently my experience with this establishment was different than some others have had. Also I rarely give anyone 5 stars.< /Review>< Pictures>

Don't shop here unless you ask about hidden costs and the actual cost for an estimate.  I described my problem they drove the car into the shop looked at it and said we can do this and this but we cannot guarantee your problem will go away.  I said oh let me think about that and they said that will be $45.  No estimate.  I feel like a fool.  Filling out the bureau of Automotive repairs complaint form next.  Don't shop here if you are smart.<//text>

Went in on a Friday to check install prices.  Came back another day and he changed the installation prices by 200 bucks, simply because I didn’t buy products from his store.  This dude is as shady as they come.  Avoid this place like the plague!  Absolute SCAM.< /text>

This shop is trash way over price and the guy behind  the counter is true what all the people say on the bad comments he has NO CUSTIMER SERVICE SKILLS bad attitude helping you get what you need and just there to RIP you off for the simplest things my onnest opinion you be wasting your time and money going there I'm surprised there still open what a waste of space when they could have a better shop there with good people they need get closed down or hire new people that enjoys CARS and have a passion for custimising CARS and good customer service skills DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE AND FIRE THAT GUY BRHIND THE COUNTER OR IF YOU THE OWNER LEAD BY EXAMPLE PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR BUSINESS AND HELP THE COSTIMERS AND LOWER YOUR PRICES STOP RIPPING PEOPLE OFF.<//Text>

I have used them for all my minor electric work with my BMW. They are finicky cars but the people here know what's up with wiring for sure. They've done my lights, stereo and next I will have them tint my car. Don't go anywhere else in Escondido. 5 stars all day.< /text><UserId.>114266261237175573155</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Went in to get subs checked cost me $40 just for them to check what was wrong with them went ahead and did it, they told me it The the amplifier would cost me about 200 for a new one plus labor. Told them I would come back other time went home and decided to take a look for myself and try to see what was going on and all it was, was a cable that was loose on the subs. My opinion they need to try harder and not take short cuts. Never coming back here ZERO STARS if I could!<//Review>< Response>

They ended up tearing out my old junky alarm system and installing a brand new one for a great price. I highly recommend this place and will be back for other services.< /Review>< Pics>

Customer service wasn’t all that great when he talked to me also saw the guy yell at a customer when he wanted to buy Westlake tires instead of Nittos. They also left all my windows dirty which I had to clean (also my side mirrors and trunk) they didn’t wipe off the alcohol or whatever they used so it stained my doors (see picture) the price was worth it I guess only time will tell. He also mentioned a 5 year warranty on the tint.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dbf3614b43c3c3:0x896508ccd51232b1</gmapID></record>

Called AudioSport and got someone in the first couple of rings. I told him what I wanted to accomplish, which was to install a stereo, GPS, back up camera and all. He said I could bring it down right away, so I did and got a call less then 2 hours later that my truck was ready to be picked up. The install was flawless and was nicer then I had hoped for. I also had them look at the existing alarm installed on this truck to see if it was usable, which it is not. AudioSport offered a full featured alarm installed including keyless entry, and removing my old alarm for one set price. The price was so low I jumped at the opportunity to have these guys do a little more work to my old truck. Could not be happier, I love getting top notch work done for a very fair in my favor price. I will be bringing my other cars to these guys soon.</Text>

<text>I will NEVER go to this place again! I was quoted $70 one day to have my new Kenwood 5 Channel amp hooked up with all the parts and everything. I thought, what a great price! I go in the next day to get it all set up and the Persian owner looks at it and tells me I need a few more things than he originally thought and the price is going to be $130. I thought as long as it gets fixed, all my speakers, my sub and radio get hooked up with the amp, i'll be happy. Before I left my car with them I was sure to clarify that the price of $130 came with all the parts and everything, the owner said yes, so we both signed the papers and I left my car with them. I thought that was it, but oh was I wrong!!! I get a call about 45 minutes later and the owner tells me that I need a few more wires (keep in mind we agreed the price of $130 included all the parts). I go back to the shop and he tells me the 4 more wires I need are going to cost me an extra $45. At this point they have my car taken apart, so there wasn't much I could do. With tax the total was going to be just about $200. I was furious!!! I questioned what he meant by me needing more wires, when we agreed all the parts were included in the price of $130. He began to get irritated with me, while all I was trying to do was understand exactly what I was going to be spending my hard earned money on. After attempting to negotiate with him, he had the audacity to ask me if I was Jewish!! (which I am) What?! I was absolutely appalled that such a "great" business man, who wanted my money and my business, would ask such a ridiculous question. There was very little I could do since he refused to go back to the $130 we originally agreed upon, AND! my car was totally taken apart and he would NOT put it back together. It was terrible. After a heated discussion he said the lowest he could do was $180, tax and everything included. I really wanted my car to be fixed so I agreed on that price.

I waited for my car for 3 hours! I was originally told it would only take an hour to an hour and a half MAX!!! I do not normally get such a temper with people the way I did with this man. The only positive thing about my experience at Audio Sport was the kindness of the man who actually did the installation. He apologized for the inconvenience. I paid (way too much), thanked them and I left.

ALSO! After the job was done, the nail in the coffin of this terrible experience was that they forgot to put my engine cover back on. I had to drive all the way back across town again to get it back.

Despite the kind installer, I would NOT recommend anybody to go here EVER! The owner is extremely rude, they can not stick to one price, they took a very long time to get the job done and if you ask why you are being charged extra at all, your religious views will be questioned.

The only reason this place has been open for so long is due to the scummy business practices.

DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE, EVER!!!!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Okay so long story short i go in with my car (e39 bmw) some guy comes out and i tell him that the speakers in the car were messed up for some reason that i did not know, so he goes on to tell me that they can check it out (never once did he mention i would be charged for this) he lets me know it will be about 1 hour to figure out what was wrong, so i patiently am waiting when they finally figured out the problem, and tells me it would be $350 to repair, thats without speakers because i had taken my own in, so i told them that was too much so i would look for some other place, he then forced me to pay $40 for the diagnostic so i payed and went down the street to jc power where they charged me 150 for everything, i later told them everythingg that had happened when they told me they often have heard complaints about audiosport<//Text>

(Translated by Google) I went to ask for a drawer for 2 10-inch subwoofers and they charged me 500 to install it, I carried everything that it occupies, I do not recommend it, they are very expensive

<Text>I am regular here and like going here; everyone is professional and took total care of their patients nicely. I went in for my cavity filling, Dr. Divya, Mark, and Linda took care of me, and my treatment went well without much pain. They let me know what I should be doing after the treatment and teach me how to make sure that I won't experience any discomfort later. This friendliness and professionalism deserve five stars ranking. I will recommend it to other people for sure.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

I did not notice until after the numbing and the swelling went down. I had to get them fixed at another dental office because my insurance had been switched to a different plan. They also ignored my request to consult a surgeon about my x-rays. I never received a call back. The receptionists are rude and unprofessional. I had a question about an overdue bill because I received a letter that said my previous insurance was already inactive during the time of my visit and she hung up on me. The next person who answered when I called back was more helpful, but would not give me the name of the person who initially hung up on me. I am also not quite sure why my dental insurance was ever approved in the first place, otherwise I would not have scheduled an appointment. I am now held responsible for paying a bill that is twice the amount I was quoted at the time of my appointment due to their negligence. I would not come back to this office or refer it to anybody else.< /Text>< Resp>

<Text>My entire family goes to Arden Oaks Dental Care! I have very sensitive teeth and my hygienist always takes extra time to ensure that my cleanings are comfortable while being thorough. I recently had a crown replaced and the level of care that was taken to make an individualized plan for my crown replacement was celebrity level treatment. I recommend Arden Oaks to people of all ages and for all types of treatment from invisalign to repair to regular maintenance cleanings!<//Text>< Pics>

Hands down, great dental care. Been going here for many years and I love the new Dentist  that has taken the reins here. Staff and dental hygienist are incredibly friendly and helpful. I definitely recommend try this place if you are sick of you current Dentist, long wait times, poor customer service, etc.< /review>

<Text>Absolutely amazing group of professionals here. Everyone here is super friendly and helpful. I feel very welcomed and less nervous about going to my dental appointments. However I do still feel nervous, so my dental hygienist, dental assistant and dentist would always tell me what procedure they are doing next and always check if I am doing ok. It definitely makes the whole experience much less nerve wrecking. They always do an amazing job on my teeth and make sure I don’t have to return too frequently. Everyone remembers me and would ask me about how things are going. Overall just very very good experience.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x809adbb80c99c645:0x639c9b2f8a0b7e25< /gmapID></record>

Dr Khiria and everyone at this facility is incredible!!! Our family is new to getting dental care. We were worried about the cost and how painful the process might be. The doctor and staff was very supportive. They took the time to explain the dental process and helped us figure out a plan that suits our families needs. We will be coming here moving forward!!< /Review>

Overall good service. I was not told that I wouldn’t receive a polish or that they would not be using the ultrasonic scaler. I was given the reason once my cleaning began, which was due to covid19 and that this can cause increase aerosol into the room. I understand their reasoning but believe you should be told this ahead of time. I am not a regular here and may have gone to another office that are currently providing this service. I now have to wait six months due to insurance before getting that service.

I was month late getting a cleaning due to all dental offices being shut down, so I did have an above normal need for cleaning. Once I was home I did have some buildup that was missed during my cleaning that is visible at the front area of my teeth where they make contact.  A very obvious area that was missed.

Overall like I said earlier the hygienist was nice and friendly and all staff I interacted with were as well.

In retrospect after leaving I thought about what they told me; I wasn’t going to have an exam where I am given a rating of my gum health such as the score per tooth where they say 1-4 measurement, but next time I can. Wasn’t explained why they would not be giving an exam. I should have asked. So all that happened was they used the manual scaler tool to scrape and I had the basic x-rays.</Review>

I just moved here and was looking for a good dentist for myself. One of my colleagues suggested to try Arden Oaks Dental Care, and I am glad I did. All the people are really nice to me and went through with me patiently. I went there for my cleaning and it went wonderful as it was first time I didn't felt much pain as being a sensitive person.  Dr. Khiria and her hygienist are really good at their work, as they explain the process thoroughly and it never felt that it was my first time coming here. Will definitely recommend others.</review>

Arden Oaks Dental is awesome. I went in today because I'm experiencing some dental issues. I haven't been to a dentist in a long time and I was feeling embarrassed. I fully expected the dentist to chastise me for neglecting my oral health. I was wrong. Each employee I met with today was kind and caring. They told me to not beat myself up over not coming in and that they were just glad to see me now. I needed a referral for a specialist and they took care of it before I left. They even called the specialist to book the appointment for me. Special thanks to Dr. Annie Barnes for not making me feel ashamed!</Text>

My son has been going to Dr. Altig and His amazing assistants Tia and Kat. They take there time with him with all of his treatment. Appointments  are always on-time. We love the office and all of the staff . Ivy and Stephanie at the front desk always welcome and friendly. We have recommended this office to many friends. We actually drive from Natomas to see all the staff . It makes a difference feeling welcomed in the office and not just another person in a chair.< /review>

i called this place yesterday to set up a new patient appointment, and the disrespectful secretary thought it was a good idea to be rude as hell to me, on the phone. I asked for a around about cost of the services. she proceeds to tell me "i wouldn't know because i'm not the doctor"  REALLY?? this is how you treat a paying customer. needless to say i cancelled my appointment and called Mr Fred Mann DDS. who was more than happy to answer my questions and put me at ease. she must have enough customers to not care about new customers.</Review>

< Review>
I was looking for a new dentist and I called Arden Oaks Dental Care ,  receptionist ( Ivy )Who answered the phone  was very nice and helpfull she  helped me figure out my insurance plan and gave me an appointment right away. When I  arrived for my appointment, I was  greeted with a warm smile , after filling out my paper I was taken back for my appointment, By a doctors Assistant by the name of Linda who was very friendly and explained every thing step by step. After X-rays were taken I soon met Dr.Khiria she was very  knowledgeable and patient with me addressing all my fears and concerns. She explained my needed treat in detail and helped me figure out the best treatment for me. After my visit with the doctor I was  asked if I would like to stay for my dental cleaning with the  hygenist who's name was Lovila she was very gentle and  thorough. My teeth felt great after my dental cleaning. At my check out I got to met a  receptionist by the name of Lissette  She was super helpful and went out of way to help me understand how my dental plan works  She and the office manager Corina are extremely Knowledgeable  in explaining my dental coverage they both Went over and Beyond  to help me in all my dental needs. Great Dr. and staff five stars all the way.< /Review>

<Review>Had a poor experience with this dentist office. Even though they offered another root canel specialist, they didn't have my best interest in mind when it came to how their own "referral" treated me poorly. Once I voiced my concerns, they treated me like I it was no big deal. Manager Stephanie is numb to her customers concerns. Brushed it right off, she felt all she had to do is simply move on and refer me to another office, as if it didn't happen. I'd fire her on the spot if she ever treated my customers that way. Don't recommend this office at all. UP DATE: Once again, they treated me like I was the problem for having concerns. They read my review and as retaliation, both Stephanie and the receptionist had the audacity to say I yelled at them, service denied. Confused by their accusations, I reasoned in my head as there was no reason to "yell at them", let alone argue. Total lie, no integrity whats so ever.  I was simply explaining my concerns through glass and a mask, a barrier which may have caused my voice to raise as I described my concerns!! But not to reprimand them, but to explain my point. There is a difference. Can you imagine the staff accusing you of a behavior you didn't actually do? Their demeanor alone is a great an example of their total denial and lack to take responsibility for their own actions and behaviors. Funny part is, they can't see it, but you can. Again, they decided to make the customer wrong. Remember when businesses actually listened to their customers concerns? NOT at this office.  It was total bizarro world to say the least. Can you imagine not being heard, then treated as if it was no big deal, and you're the customer/patient? Don't even go here, even if you read positive reviews. Those are experiences where they were pleased with their out come. BUT, if you have concerns, they will listen but won't hear you tell them anything they don't consider important to them. Imagine if your tooth and mouth has an issue.< /Review><Date>1621893664523< /Date></record>

I was surprised that this place has been open for over a year and I barely found out about it! There's not advertisement on the main street however there is a sign that says Creamycrepes on the building. We tried the build your own crepe and a Frappuccino. The crepe tasted delicious and the frappuccino as well! This will be my go to spot for a nice dessert!🙂👍🏼<//text>

Last week I tired the crepes for the first time. I was so impressed with the taste, customer service, and huge menu that I decided I had to try more. Since then, I’ve tried the sweet cream fruit, açaí bowl and all have been PHENOMENAL. I can’t wait to try something new tomorrow as well! Definitely recommend!!< /review>

Very welcoming I thought he was the owner or something because of how much passion he was putting into what he was doing and how great he talked about the place. Owners are  be super super fortunate to have an employee.< /text>

My family and I have been here twice so far and it never disappoints! Super yummy crepes and hand rolled ice cream. It's definitely our new dessert spot.</text>

<Text>Just tried this place for the first time. We will definitely be back. Both of the men who work there are great but Carlos gave special attention when showing my 3 year old exactly how her ice cream was being made. The crepes were delicious and it was fairly priced.</Text>< Name>

Sad! I love this place but they say open till 8pm went at 6pm and all their lights were off. But the ice cream is amazing. Try the Fish waffle with pistachio and cheese cake ice cream!</Text>

My crepes were doughy. The peaches were canned. And the caramel glaze was syrup. Wouldn't recommend.</Review>

My children although they enjoyed the show of watching their ice cream being made they did not enjoy the taste as much. To be fair i make custard base ice cream at home.</Text>

<review>This place is very good and well priced. We had their crepes and tried several of their drinks, both hot and cold. The crepes were very well priced and tasted delicious. The owner is a really nice guy. One of my crepes was a bit overcooked as he was trying to multitask making our food and drinks all at once by himself, and he knew it and without us asking he made me a new one and brought it to the table and apologized that the 1st one was a bit overcooked. Their red velvet frappacino is the best one I've ever had so make sure you try it!<//review>< pictures>

This place is amazingly cute! And their food is so good and fresh. I've only been here twice but it's always been a delightfully prompt and joyous experience.
My family's favorite things from there are the strawberry crêpes with Nutella and their fresh juices (my favorite is the orange/carrot).
Highly recommend you check this place out.<//Review>

The guy (with the strong cologne) "claimed" everything is made of 100% fruit (like the smoothies etc) not from powder. I ddnt ask, he just brought it up. Then when he went to make my smoothie, I noticed he put some kind of powder in my drink. I walked towards the end of the room & what do you know, he already started blending the powder to make my smoothie. I also looked up to the top shelf & I see 2 big containers of instant coffee. Smh. Tasted my coffee & sure enough, it's not brewed. Then when I got to my crepe, the fruits were warm. Not warm from the crepe but warm like it's been sitting out & not refrigerated. & alot of the fruit in it ( like the mango) were canned fruits. Very disappointed in this gimmick crepe shop. Seems as if they have this very pretty menu that all have been photoshopped from the internet smh. Oh + another thing, he was the only worker. You cannot be the cashier & make the food. That's a No No< /review>

We ordered the Vietnamese Broken Rice dish with grilled beef and deep fried ground shrimp, wrapped in tofu skin.  The order came with soup on the side. Highly recommend asking for the beef Pho broth. Portion is plentiful and full filling. Priced right too.< /review>

Same old place with delicious food .usually order the Nem rolls combo , and a noodle Pho , food portion get smaller but same price.Pho taste ok. I still like the rolls that you can wrap yourself not the pre made from kitchen.</Review>

<Time>1510608283930< /Time><Rate>5<//Rate><text>I love this place! I always come here with the family to enjoy a full and inexpensive meal. The good is great and I always recommend the BBQ pork chop rice dish! An absolute classic I always come for.

On top of that, the owner is always super nice. I always see her coming out to greet and talk to customers, even taking orders herself! A big highlight that my family and I always love is that she makes the fish sauce or nuoc mam herself, and as a Vietnamese descendant person, IT IS AMAZING. I highly recommend even buying a bowl full of it to take home.

You hear all those Vietnamese people bragging about how their family makes the best Pho, or rice, or fish sauce, but I can honestly put my pride down and say, her fish sauce is much better than anything I've tasted.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

While the food is okay, the portion varies from time to time.  One day you get more, the next day you get less for the exact order.  Same thing with the taste, it's not consistent,  good today, maybe bad next time. They charge more for  almost everything when requesting just little bit more, like vegetables for your noodle soup or whatever. This is the only restaurant that changes extra for things like that.<//text>

The bun is comparable to the Com Tam on Del Mar/Valley; however, this place takes the cake for having a shrimp egg roll and nam (ham) on their vermicelli. However, don't order the egg roll appetizer; not the same kind of egg roll and not much flavor..< /text>

This place is excellent. The instructors are very informative, and caring. The level of professionalism is high. I recommend TruFusion to anyone! As far as the facilities, they are always well maintained and very clean. The workout rooms are spacious and comfortable to workout in. Everyone there is very resourceful in all things about physical health and fitness services. I'm very happy with the way they do things here! Thank you!<//text>

Had the free intro hot vinyasa class and this place blew me away ! It looked like a swanky city club inside and was super clean! The class was great , I even cried at at the end with a good hip opener sequence the instructor had us do. Everyone was super friendly I would totally come back and recommend this place for beginners or more advanced. Seemed like a one size fits all class.<//text>

<review>A really, really great yoga studio.  Each teacher is amazing so you can’t go wrong, but I really like classes with Lauren, Emeline, and Brianna.  Definitely a workout but they still focus on mindfulness.  A great variety of yoga classes and bootcamp style/spin classes.  Would literally recommend to anyone!!<//review>< username>

I recently switched studios for their top notch yoga classes alone. Love the zen atmosphere of their beautiful yoga room. I was focused on yoga, but I have found that Tru-Fusion’s variety of offerings and diverse ability levels of all the different classes has been amazing. Add to that a clean, gorgeous, modern studio and impressive skill level and the sincere friendliness of their teachers and management has been first class. You won’t be disappointed!</review>

I am a long-time member at Trufusion Blue Diamond in Las Vegas, and during Covid I was forced to move home to the Bay Area and to my delight I realized there was a Trufusion in Walnut Creek! I have been extremely pleased that this location operates in a very similar manor to my usual studio, as I had become so accustomed to it.  If you are a fan of hot classes and want lots and lots of variety in your workouts, this will be the ideal studio for you. You will feel welcome every single time, whether you are a beginner or a seasoned veteran. TruTribe is there to get you feeling amazing and confident again! 💪🏼<//Review>

Liiiisten! I love this studio. Classes are beginner friendly for the newbies in fitness! They're also perfectly challenging for the most veterans of exercise gurus. For the product you get (so many types of classes under one roof), the price is a steal. This business is ethnical and honest, and all the instructors are thoughtful to remember each client. Come consistently and frequently, and you'll benefit the most!!< /Text>

They are currently holding classes outdoors due to Contra Costa County being in the purple zone, they are taking precautious measures to make sure everybody is safe during this epidemic. We stand 6 feet apart from each other while on our yoga matts. Overall a great group of ladies, they really care about their students definitely worth the money.</text>

TruFusion has been a game changer for me! Such a variety of classes all under one roof and more importantly one membership. The heat takes the workouts to the next level which is just what I needed. So many great instructors that will motivate you and play the best music to keep you pumped. Facilities are beautiful as well as the customer service. Join the TruTribe!</review>

Since joining TruFusion my excitement to go to the gym has been greater than it’s ever been! I literally leave classes drenched in sweat and check the schedule to see what class I can choose from the huge variety offered under one roof. TruFusion is very well run(Kate), extremely clean, with beyond friendly staff who are genuine and encouraging. I’d highly recommend TruFusion to all genders, ages, fitness levels because the fitness staff will find way to cater to your exact needs!</text>< Pictures>

Nice club,  great classes.   Front desk personnel is unprofessional and make it impossible to try and cancel your membership.  The manager,  Kate took 2 weeks to return my calls and emails after I left 3 follow up phone messages and 3 follow up emails messages.  This location may need a stronger more experienced manager who is accountable for her staff and one that can respond to customers in a timely manner.</review>

I can get my yoga cravings in one day and the next do some kickboxing or boot camp classes.  The teachers are so welcoming and encouraging.

While parking is somewhat annoying, the instructors and variety of classes are awesome. Two things might be deal breakers for me to continue my monthly membership...cost of childcare per hour is very expensive if you plan to use it multiple time per week and they need many more earlier classe times (5:00am weekday and 6:00am/7:00am weekends). It's also a bummer that the best and most challenging yoga class is at 4:00 PM. For someone with a family, these things  are so important. I suppose this might be the perfect place for the "millelial" with no family, job or regular time commitments.</Text><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

I'm a kickboxing and HIIT junkie so at Tru I can do those things AND mix it up with yoga, spin, etc. The YinFused class (yoga + foam rolling) is amazing for sore muscles! Other favorite classes include Barefoot Bootcamp and Soulful Sunday. Be prepared to sweat! You will leave feeling stronger, calmer, and more confident. If you can only join one gym, this is the one.< /Review><Date>1576361616938< /Date><gmapID>0x808561a99b5da71d:0x4302a160282aee3e<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The gentleman that owns the store is very nice. He's very appreciative of you shopping at his store. He does whatever he can to satisfy his customers needs. Even though he's  there alot of hours, he always has a smile.</Text>

Well it was alright. I didn't like the drinks or the employees there but the place was clean and neat. I would give five stars if the employees were a bit more professional and polite, and the drinks were good. There should be more options.<//Text>

This is where the Hope Thrift Store is in Fremont?  The liquor store is overpriced. Have not went to Bronco Billys there but heard its good.   Hope station has great prices and selection.<//text>

The roads however are very rough. it sucks thrift town closed. It's what tied everything together.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<rating>3<//rating><text>The employees are friendly. The prices are a little high but the store is conveniently located and the pharmacy staff are very polite and knowledgeable,  but they really need to employ additional help in that dept. There are usually lines with only one clerk working the counter and drive thru window, alone and quite often.</text>< Pics>

Basic liquor store.  Doesn't have anything out of the ordinary.  Feels like a brown bag type of store.  Cashiers are cool.<//Text>

Thrift Town is here! One of my fav bay area thrift stores. Then there's a Walgreens which is great, and always useful. And a handy little liqueur store - Seems like it gets plenty of traffic, but isn't creepy, lol</Text>

< Review>
I have been going to this Dentist for many years and have found that everyone at this location are the most professional and caring people I have ever met. Anne, Sara, and Dr. Yee are very good at everything they do. I am so fortunate to have these fine people keeping me healthy. I have left out a few names but feel so confident in this Dental Clinic.

<text>I have not been to the dentist in years so I was of course very scared to enter the office.  Stephanie greeted me at the door and made me feel at ease right from the beginning!  When Dr. Gee came in I shared with him my fear and he right away started making jokes with me and calmed my nerves.  I went back for a 2nd visit today again with nerves but the procedure was done well and again I felt at ease and was well taken care of.  Thank you for making my trip to the dentist again a good one!  See you soon!!< /text>< Pictures>

<text>My wife and I have been coming to Dr. Gee since he began his practice in Sunnyvale many years ago.  Never have we been dissatisfied with the work he and his staff perform.  He takes immense pride in his work and surrounds himself with people of like mind.  I have had several crowns to replace broken teeth that couldn't hold up as I grew older and each one has been a work of art, performing flawlessly with no side effects, gum issues, or other problems that could arise from a poorly installed crown.  The procedure is close to painless as he works to efficiently perform the necessary steps to completion.  His longtime dental assistant works seamlessly with him as an integral part of this close knit team.   He provides candid, informed advice, never trying to push an unnecessary treatment.  He is personable and caring, clearly thinking of the best interests of his patients.  His hygienists are experienced and expert, never cutting corners or hurrying a treatment.  The rest of the staff reflects this level of professionalism and are as caring and helpful as Dr. Gee.  His office during this CV19 pandemic is pristine with all of the recommended safeguards, procedures and then some.  I never felt exposed or worried that there would be exposure.  My wife and I highly recommend Dr. Gee and his dental team.  I'm sorry there are only 5 stars...not enough to fully cover this man and his staff.<//text></record>

My first visit.  They are very carful with decontamination  and wearing all the protective gear.  Staff courteous and Dr explained planned care well and answered all my questions.  Hygienist, Trang, did my cleaning through and  gently.  My previous Dentist just retired.  Next visit 6 months.  Keep flossing.</review>

Excellent!  The doctors and the staffs are very professional and friendly!  Love them.
This time, I was very pleased with them; they followed all the steps to make sure everyone is safe; checking the temperature,  wearing  mask, sanitizing hands and keeping the distance. Many thanks to all of them.<//Text>

This is a friendly, caring dental practice.  Paula, my dental hygienist is a true professional, addressing every detail of my dental health.  Dr. Gee, my dentist, and Paula, and Sarah (who keeps office and patients organized) always have fun conversation.   I have been with this practice for 25+ years, having had a variety of dental work, always without any problems.
This is the place to go for any dental need.</Review>

My original appointment had been cancelled, but when an opening came up, they contacted me almost immediately for a new appointment.  They carefully explained the new office procedure over the phone before coming in.  They efficiently handled the checking in process, and once in the office, asked me a number of COVID-19 - related questions (and took my temperature).  They also explained why there would be some differences in the teeth cleaning procedure.  Once done, I could see them disinfecting the room I had just been in.  I was able to pay at the desk, and then was directed to leave by a different door than which I had entered.  All in all, the whole visit was handled very well.<//text>

<review>I would like to recognize Trang who is my new hygienist at Dr. Gee office. She was very professional, caring and made me feel safe as she cleaned my teeth. She had Dr. Gee take a look at a suspicious tooth that she noticed. I made another appointment to see her next time.   Thank you!</review>< pics>

Dr. Gee and staff are highly competent and great bedside manner. I have been seeing them for about 5 years and have no problem seeing them under any circumstance. Just visited them after they opened up after (COVID) and they are diligent at maintaining a sterile environment while providing excellent customer service.<//text>

Our family had Dr Gee as our dentist many years ago and we totally loved him.  He even came in on a Saturday when I had an emergency.  We now live in Fremont and had to find another dentist.  Today I had to see our dentist because I pulled out a crown eating M&M Caramel.  It was a gold crown Dr Gee had put in - not only was the crown intact and able to be recemented the dentist totally admired the workmanship. Looking at the crown she said I so love a gold crown. So we all - Joe, Toni and Dallas (married with 2 kids) - miss you and thanks for your great work. Take care.</review>

I saw Dr. Nina Mohazzab for an exam and cleaning. She is very professional and thorough. During the procedure she would ask me, "You doing okay?" Very caring. So grateful for this Front Line worker and her staff for being there for all of us during this COVID pandemic.  Highly recommend.</Review>

Felt very safe. They had lots of protective measures in place. Called to let them know I was at the office waiting in my car. They called when they were ready for me. Dental hygienist and dentist had lots of PPE on.</Text>

We have been going to this dental office since the 90's. After Dr Markuson retired, I been getting the same excellent care from Dr Nina. Both dentists and all the hygienists and office staff are incredibly warm, friendly and caring. I have been there during the COVID19 pandemic, and they're doing all the right things to minimize any risk to patients and staff. If you're looking for a new dentist in the Sunnyvale area, you won't go wrong to give them a ring.</Text>

As usual, friendly and professional. We will be moving, and we will miss Dr Gee and his team. We’ve recommended him to a number of our friends, and all have remained fans and patients.<//review>

<text>Dr. Steven Gee is an awesome dentist.  He is great at explaining dental procedures and what to expect. My husband and I have been patients of Dr. Gee and Dr. Markusen (now retired) for twenty years.  We have had many fillings and crowns done with great results.  We have also had broken teeth built up at a reasonable cost. They and their staff are the best! Sarah is friendly and really nice.  Trish and Gloria are excellent with billing and estimating patient costs.  They truly go above and beyond in coordinating with my insurance company.  My current hygienist is Paula and she is wonderful and uses all the latest technology.  She also teaches at a local college (at City College West Valley).  I have been very happy with all of the hygienists I've had.  We are blessed to have Dr. Gee and the entire staff in our lives. Huge thank you to Dr. Gee and team for all you have done and do for our family!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Dr. Steven Gee is a fantastic dentist.  He is straight forward with how your teeth are doing, but yet gentle knowing how people are afraid of dentists.  I have had a crown put in by Dr. Gee and it was a quick procedure with little pain.  And no pain following the next few days either.  All the hygienist there are super friendly, explain what they are doing while they are cleaning your teeth, and give recommendations-if needed- on how to keep your teeth cavity free.<//text>

Dr. Gee’s office make me feel safe and caring to get in.
Dr. Gee use his skillful expertise to clean both my tooth and the cape, did the fixing job within 20 minutes. I left the office with happy and confidence, that
the problem tooth will have a long time to go.<//Review>

I recommended Dr. Gee and the entire office with no hesitation whatsoever. UPDATE: I have seen Dr. Gee twice since the pandemic.

I have been going to this office for several years. I never have a problem being seen at my scheduled time and I am always greeted with a pleasant smile from Sara at the counter. Sally  does a great job cleaning my teeth and the office is always very clean. Dr. Markuson is my dentist although I have been seen by Dr. Gee on a few occasions and I have to say that they are both pleasant, professional and personable. They never seem to be rushed when they are with you. If your looking for a nice experience when going to the Dentist this is the office for you.< /review>

Dr. Gee has been my dentist for decades!... every since he started at the Sunnyvale office! I have had my share of problems with old fillings and Dr. Gee has handled every issue skillfully and prudently. I have COMPLETE confidence in his ability and integrity. He is the consummate professional.

I have never interacted with a professional who is more consistently upbeat and pleased to see his clients.  He treats his clients like friends. And the cheerful and courteous attitude carries over to all his staff. I'm always in a better mood after visiting Dr. Gee's office.< /Review>

We are in a pandemic and Dr Gee’s office handled my visit perfectly with knowledge and care. From taking my temp before I could enter, using hand sanitizer before I sat in the chair, sanitizing my mouth, and learning all the extreme cleaning that is done in between patients. I felt comfortable, cared for and safe. I love everyone there and Dr Gee always has something fun or interesting to talk about while he’s doing my exam. 5 stars to everyone!<//Review>

We moved out of the country almost 8 years ago, but any time I’m visiting the Bay Area I schedule an appointment with the hygienist as I strongly appreciate the service and the quality of treatments of this dental clinic.< /Text>

He doesn't try to "upsell" you on any additional services or products - totally looks out for the patient's interest.  Cannot say enough about how easy every appointment is and how the whole staff is so polite and makes you feel like going to the dentist is always a pleasant and easy experience.  You are in good hands with Dr. Gee and his staff.  Ps.  I rarely write reviews, so this is very much of a big deal from me.<//review><Name>Rockeeb Alboa Patel< /Name><Resp>None<//Resp>< Rate>

I have been going to this dental office since 1990 and would highly recommend them for all of your dental needs.  Everyone in the office is  friendly, courteous, patient, gentle, and understanding.  Excellent high quality dental work and preventive treatments.  They work diligently to accommodate your scheduling needs. Dr. Gee and Ann are the best! Every visit is exceptional! All safety measures are being followed.<//text>

I came right before their "parking lot" party ended. The band sounded great a mile away. It looked like a good time. The next one is in September so hopefully I'll see you then.< /review>

<user_name>Ali</user_name><review>The station is "hidden" in an upstairs suite,  located in a business area of town.  You could easily drive right passed it several times (like I did), before noticing it.  The office is very clean and they give you free KCAL (&/or KOLA 99.9) stickers upon request.</review>< userid>

Small building and unnoticeable if you dont have the address or don't see the K-CAL can out front. Parking lot is Huge and the atmosphere is wonderful. Any Rocker or Metalhead will love 96.7 K-CAL ROCKS station. Highly reccomend.< /Review>

Small building and unnoticeable if you dont have the address or don't see the K-CAL can out front. Parking lot is Huge and the atmosphere is wonderful. Any Rocker or Metalhead will love 96.7 K-CAL ROCKS station. Highly reccomend.</text>

I went through the drive-thru and ordered to fish sandwiches with no sauce. When I got home what I found instead work to egg mcmuffins. I had to throw them away because I don't eat meat on Fridays.</text>

Lets start by saying of the fast food places, I kind of "hate" Mcdonalds these days!
The other fast food chains (BK, JACK) have made some tables available for dine in here in San Diego..but McDonalds is in no hurry to do the same, because they're probably making as much or more money without bothering with sitting customers whatsoever...not even in tables outside! (when they usually have them!).
So I went to this location because they're pretty much all thats available in that area, and since I wasn't in a car to look for other options, I had to purchase my food there and while at it, decided to try those new chicken sandwiches (the ones that look like theyre trying to imitate Chick Fil-a) and I'm telling you...NOT a chance!  This thing was fried to death, it was almost black/flavorless and the Milk shake was so watery it was horrible!
And we know Mcdonalds prices are high for fast food...so it was a total waste of money!
And btw, their team lead/expediter or whatever he was, he was kind of abrupt...I guess he had to get back to the window...but that's what I mean...they're too busy to bother with any kind of Customer Service and it shows, by not re-opening any of their sitting.
They just want your money and get you the hell out!<//Text>

<Text>If it were possible I would give them a zero. Their employees look dead inside and I feel extremely bad for them. They must have poor quality management... I've worked in fast food before but in all those times of working at a fast food chain I have never seen anyone or personally ever been as depressed and soulless as their employees... And I see customers give them so much poop for being a human being... Hope the employees are okay.<//Text>< Pics>

<Date>1620358553580<//Date><Rate>1</Rate><review>Worse McDonald's experience ever (for me)! Let's not kid ourselves, it's McDonald's, so the standard is naturally low. However, that cannot be an excuse for an absolutely abysmal service.
This specific store has a two-lane drive thru. Unfortunately, if you end up on the wrong one, or depending on how the employee taking your order feels, you may have to deal with them servicing 5 cars on the other lane first, including those that used to be behind you. While not necessarily a big deal if you have time, it gets annoying and ultimately ruins the entire purpose of a speedy drive thru experience. Not to mention that it lacks every aspect of proper customer service. After complaining about it, the response was simply "I'm just not gonna take your order." That person, claiming to be the manager (who thought it was unnecessary to wear a name tag), excused the car situation with "well, sometimes it happens." After telling him that I consider this unprofessional and customer unfriendly as there was no apparent reason to be completely ignored (e.g. a line of cars blocking my side of the drive thru), it was basically just shrug off. "Oh well"...deal with it. To me, this corroborates the attitude this service team has towards its customers. It's non-existent. They don't care. The cherry on top, however, was the "f your life" comment as I was on my way out the premises. Just for the fun of it, I'll reach out to the actual franchisee and leave a similar review for them. Long story short, not only will your health thank you to "dine" elsewhere, but this store deserves zero business! You'll find plenty of reviews here outlining their bad customer service and the poor attitude among the folks working there.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

The entire employee function in here is completely reducible if you want to think about quality of an individual. How hard it is to get sugar for the coffee? Don't think you'll have any after asking three separate employment personal here. Nightmare to everybody.</review>

<Text>Good place to go to if you want a puddle of translucent slime in your sandwich. There is a nice woman at the drive thru that will deliver your food, but be careful what you get since you don't know who's making your food.<//Text>< name>

I'd give them 5 stars if they'd only open the restroom. Still, I'm thankful that the dining room is open for carryout. The service is also really fast too but I think that's because they're not as busy as other McDonald's restaurants.< /Review>

<review>Overall a clean store. Nice dining area with a outdoor patio. Restrooms are clean, soda area was stocked and cleaned. My burger and fries came fast.
ONLY 1 complaint. When waiting for my food I watched a young kid run up and grab another guests fries from the serving counter . When that happened the employee should have replaced them immediately before the guest received his food. The employee who called the number for the food seen it happen as I did. If it were my fries I would not have been happy  being served those fries when plenty more are available<//review>< pics>

Terrible. There were about 5 of us waiting in line and it was around 8:40pm no one attended the drive through. I could hear static and all the lights were in in the store so I know it wasn’t closed. I’m not one to write bad reviews but I worked a 15 hour shift and for something like this to happen for no reason is unacceptable. The others and I waited for over half an hour. We saw someone inside but idk if they purposely avoided us. Went to another McDonald’s and it was open. Whoever was on the shift needs to be fired. Lost a lot of customers.</Review>

Really updated McD's. They have nice employees and they will bring your food to your table if you do the table ordering, not every location does so it is nice. Drive through does take a little bit longer and it is a really long drive through so they can accommodate a lot more people but definitely worth the wait compared to other locations as my food has usually been fresh so far<//text>

I had to wait 20 min for some burgers and a few happy meals. I did not receive all of my food and the food that I did receive was not made correct. To make this experience even better we drove back to have our food corrected and they didn't get the order right again! Our order was so simple I'm still amazed they messed it up twice. Find another McDonald's if you want better service.</review>

Highschool age kid taking orders for the dining area. The word 'clueless' came to mind about this kid. Gave me 2 griddles, instead of my egg McMuffin's. Then they didn't give me my orange juice. Had to call the manager over who 'finally' gave it to me.  I was a McDonald's manager for 6 years. So I know how this all works or how it's supposed to.. Drive-thru unfortunately is given priority, the shift managers all running around for the drive-thru customers as if they are the 'only' one's that matter. Well, guess what? We all matter!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Tried the new crispy chicken sandwich, their entry into the current chicken sandwich war.  It doesn't even come close to the current top three chicken sandwiches of (1) Chick-fil-A, (2) Popeye's, and (3) KFC.  The taste was ok, but the size was less than half the thickness of the competition.  It was more in line with Jack-in-the-box's failed chicken sandwich entry.</Text>

Food was served hot and fresh, but I had to wait a few minutes at the counter to ask for condiments - because the expediter turned away so quickly, and the cashier didn't call anyone over to see what I needed even though he noticed me waiting. Both were very young and still seemed to be in training, learning the job - so I was more patient with them due to that (I've been in their shoes so I know how it is)
The dining room needs better ventilation, it was smoky and exacerbated my asthma. Restroom was clean and stocked with supplies.</Text>< date>

I don't live in San Diego but I can say this is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to. The Camera, the girl working cashier, was extremely rude. They also don't have water at the soda machine so you are required to ask to get it from the drive through soda machine. It also smelled terrible. I was only there for five minutes and everything was miserable.</Text>

Kinda surprised at the atmosphere. Very clean and relaxing. Love the dining room area. However service was very slow. But that could have been a new employee that just started working. I would definitely go again. Besides luv, luv, luv the McRib sandwich. 😊</review>

<Review>Ordered breakfast. It was delicious, but drive through line was crawling. When I got to the window, the workers were inside talking while my food was sitting by the window. I had to knock on the glass to get their attention. They apologized, and were friendly, but breakfast rush time should be fast so I can get to work.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Consistently bad experience. Even when they’re slow it takes forever to get an order and  have had three times in a row getting wrong order.  You’d think with McDonald’s systems of being efficient it would be simple for them to execute but they don’t.< /review>

It was really warm inside like half the AC wasn't working.  Then, we waited at least 10 minutes for our breakfast order.
Food was really good. Service was slow. Restaurant was warm.< /Review>

Guess who just stole my fries? Ordered nine cheeseburgers, four small french fries, and two large Diet Cokes. Guess both McDonald's and my kid can't count because that ain't what I got, just as well since dad shouldn't be eating those fries anyway. Good dollar menu items which is why I come here, leave the gourmet burgers to people who'll do it right. FYI note to corporate, your fancy burger should be the Big Mac. But what a good deal those cheeseburgers are at $1, I used to come here years ago for the speedy hamburgers which were $.50 or so. The food that you actually get is cooked well enough. Good drinks except why the hell did they get rid of the 42 ounce cups!!! Corporate rant again that's unrelated to this location.</text>

<Text>Went to this McDonald's and asked for a big Mac , fish sandwich with nuggets. Well I did not get nuggets and the big Mac was kinda cold they could do better with the food and service here. This McDonald's seems to have alot of problems getting your order correct !!!! This is not the first time I have had a problem at this restaurant with getting my order right.

This McDonald's has one of the friendliest and hardest working staff member..sorry dont know her name but she's fantastic and every time I go in there to eat and see her she's chatting and joking with all the guests, on top of placing orders and juggling about 10 things at one time..</text>

Quiet and clean with new anti homeless measures in place including a clean, neat dining room with no salt, pepper, napkins, or access to water. Features an industrial ketchup dispensing system. Blended coffee is the main seller so the sound accompanies breakfast!<//review>

The lady repeated my order at the window, but left some things off.  When I realized she asked me why I said yes to half of the stuff.  Horrible service.  Must have been a coincidence that she left out all the condiments instead.
She shouldn't be working there of she hated dealing with customers that much.
They told me that I was welcome to come back for ketchup when I called.  They did not tell me that they were sorry.</review>

They can't count cash they will steal your money. I know working at McDonald's is a hard career to have but at least have common sense. And I ordered tenders and I pulled up to the window they only said they had enough for 4 not six. TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!<//Review>

Ordered 2 double cheeseburgers on sale at 2 for $3. Disappointed, all the burger was is their regular cheeseburger with an extra meat patty. Drive thru moved a bit slow but I managed to get thru in about 5 minutes.  I drove about 3 blocks and discovered that they did not give me a straw for my large Dr Pepper. It eas a challenge to drive in rush hour traffic having to drink directly from the cup without spilling in my lap.<//text>

I stoped by to take a fast order earlier today just few minutes from closing time coz i was in a hurry and hungry and after waiting for few minutes on the drive through with no one asking me what my order is and all the cars in front of me went through and a car behind me, i called to see if anyone is there and was surprised with a lady who claimed that she asked me what i wanted and I didn’t answer and that she can’t take any more orders.
To that lady i say, that was unfair and something that you wouldn’t do to a customer at ur door especially with a camera showing you that i’ve been waiting. Even If you asked once with no answer like you said, you should ask twice. I was there for few minutes with cars in front of me and behind me. You acted unprofessionally and wasted my time.
I wonder what would you or your supervisor do and how would you feel if you were in my shoe<//Text>

It's a McDonald's, what do you expect? Fast food, decent service, great location with drive thru service. Not going to comment on food quality because it's a McDonald. Parking lot could use some extra lights. Should be a 2.5 but fraction is not  allowed.</text>

It is what can be expected, McDonald's! Usually visit early mornings, so giving it a 5 star rating because it's always quick service in the drive thru and customer service is friendly.<//review>

They wouldn't let me use coupon for happy meal because it was in sale.  In the menu display the toys they were giving was beanie babies but we for some Spanish Valentine's book and stickers.  I can't even understand Spanish.   They should have said something when I ordered two happy meals.  Kids weren't too happy about it.  But it looked clean from outside.< /review>

If it weren't for their fries, McDonalds would be out of business. Over my lifetime, I've seen the size of the burgers, as well as the quality, dramatically decrease.   I will still go through the drive thru if I need sustinance, and I'm in a big hurry, but I will only get the the 1$ McChicken. That is a fair deal. I just can't fathom spending $8 on a combo when I know the food will be sub par.</review>

Love the fries when they are hot and cooked right. Food not always fresh. The last time I ordered a fish filet, but recieved an artisan chicken. Was driving so I could not return.</Text>

If I could give zero Stars I would. Went through the drive-thru, waited in the waiting spot, 10 minutes later no food. I had to call in order to get my food I have small children in the car so I can't just get out to see what's going on. When I talk to the person on the phone it took them 3 times to realize what happened in my order. On top of that my drink was wrong. I can hear the guy in the Drive-Thru arguing in Spanish with another lady whether or not my drink was correct. And when I finally got my food my fries were only half full. I called and left a complaint at the corporate headquarters. We will see if anything happens.< /Text>

<review>After ordering food we couldn't find a clean table. Clear nobody cleaned after morning rush hours. The ketchup was empty, and generally dirty in that area. There's no public salt and pepper, there is no sugars and creamer for my wife's coffee . Had to request all at the counter , stingy management like the didn't have enough sugar on hand. Management problem for not ordering supplies . Glad to exit door dirty.<//review>< pics>

The quality of food is awful. Nothing had changed in the last 30 years except the prices are higher by a lot and still nasty food. I'll check them out in another 20 years LOL< /review>

< review>
Taken from my Yelp review written on June 26, 2017.
Came here on a hot, Sunday afternoon at around 16:45 (4:45pm) with my friend here on the drive thru. I ordered 6 McDoubles, 6 Mcchickens, and 2 Large Dr. Peppers which was almost $26.
After driving through, I did not realize they had 2 windows. Lucky for me, I came on a slow day so I was able to reverse. I gave my card to the person and then she gave it back to me. I did not know whether to go to the second window or not so I just drove back to the other window. I was staring at the window waiting for someone. No one came until about 5-7 minutes later after chatting with my friend over him being grumpy (yes he was hungry). Anyways, I got my food and then was greet with a generic "thank you, have a nice day."
The food was good though probably because I had to wait. I liked the fact that I had to wait for it because usually it means that they are giving fresh new meat rather than something that is sitting there (a practice that some fast food managers like to do in order to save some precious stock inventory money). My only complaint is the service I get at this location. I have been here a few other times on the drive through, but never have once I seen an employee being happy working here. Two things I wanted to mention on that regard.
First, when i backed out, the lady gave me a look. Did not smile and just took my card. She did not even say a word which led me to think that she probably wanted to either laugh at my mistake or just think that I was an idiot. She would not say anything after one silly mistake.
Second, at the second drive thru window, no one greeted me. The drinks weren't even given to us as we were thirsty on a nice hot day until our orders were ready. I used to work at a fast food and I remember drinks were given first before the orders. I would tell them that it would come out in a moment or an indication that we will be waiting longer than usual. (5 minutes is usually the standard time for waiting for our food). I wonder if my order was way too big but I felt that the service could have been improved.
Finally as I mentioned earlier, there was no communication of when is my order ready or if I needed any sauce. There was not even a single greeting acknowledging that I was here at all which I feel is standard for all the McDonalds I have been.
Overall though, compared to several Mcdonalds I have gone in the past, this is probably one of the most depressing one's I've been to on the drive thru side. The service here is okay and can be improved. I was the only car at that time. While I do not mind the wait, there should clearly be some indication that I would wait or at least do a friendly greeting where I am appreciated by visiting this location. The only reason why I am not giving a one star is because the burgers were actually fresh. However, I am disappointed in the service at this location.<//review>

<Text>This location has been showing discrimination against me and my family and other white people especially if you are homeless people and that is against the law and extremely wrong!!!!!!!! I don't understand how this places employees can be so discriminatory and rude to paying customers homeless or what'ever you are. They print out  promo surveys on all of their receipts and except the codes from anyone that is not homeless looking or white looking and this is against the law and extremely wrong!!!!! All their employees including managers speak Spanish when saying things horrible about a customer thinking white people don't know Spanish language and I am furious because of the stuff I heard. They must not know in the Great nation of United States of America all citizens take Spanish language class manditorily in highschool!! So we whites do know what you say about us customers and it's extremely offensive and wrong!!!!! Today the manager said  in Spanish language I'm not taking promo codes from my people and it's wrong. So me and my people will start recording the discrimination!!!!</Text>< userid>

Went here on a Tuesday morning for breakfast before a fishing trip. Waited 15 minutes in the drive through and had to leave before we got our food. Seriously a bad experience with the lowest service. Go to a different franchise or jack in the box for their breakfast.<//text>

< Review>
I just returned home after ordering a breakfast meal. The iincluded muffins were cold and stale. They omitted the hash browns that I had to return to the counter to obtain. They had no receipt paper to give the customer.Condiments left off tray and had to return to the counter to obtain. I called to speak to a manager, Adriana, asking if the business was company owned or private (it is private: owner Ramsy Awad). I was told to "call back sometime after 10:00am" when he was due in.
Had breakfast there last week at that time the service was excellent and the meal hot and fresh. Same order this time; very different experience! No wonder Mcdonalds stock is down. I won't be back.</Review>

Many times they give me 3 creamer or no sugar at all, like today,I'order a medium coffe with 3 sugar and it taste like he filled half of cup of sugar ,please someone do something my lunch time is now over and I can't go back to get my coffe prepared correctly.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>
