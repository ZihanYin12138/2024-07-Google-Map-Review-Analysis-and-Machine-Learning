<Review>Upon my first visit I was made to feel very comfortable by the doctor. They took x-rays and went over them clearly with me. Helped me get a better understanding of my pain and then offered a plan to recovery. Good pricing and I'm very happy so far.</Review>< userid>

Doctor Levon is absolutely amazing. He is extremely professional! I have chronic back pain for many years and herniated disks problem. I have been seen many chiropractors and physical therapists. Nothing seemed to work for me. When I got pregnant my back pain got more severe and luckily I found this place in downtown. I came few times for adjustments and my pain disappeared. I just couldn’t believe I was pain free while my OB would prognoses that I would be in pain throughout all my pregnancy. After I got my baby I needed to come back for adjustment again because lifting baby and lack of sleep wasn’t doing  good for my back. Doctor Levon fixed me again. I also brought my newborn baby for tiny adjustments because I was worried about her neck muscles. We both doing absolutely great. I highly recommend this place. I feel my body and my muscles breathe fully after each visit. Thank you doctor Levon and to extremely friendly office stuff.< /text>

First timer with chiropractic care. I am a travel nurse (making it twice as hard to find medical care in unfamiliar cities). I was initially very nervous and maybe even skeptical but Dr. Levon was very patient and informative! Practically held my hand throughout the entire process. The office was clean, the staff professional and efficient. I got all my concerns heard, X-rays and adjustment all in the first visit. Never felt rushed or pushed out and they do a great job at creating a welcoming environment! Only on my second visit and I can honestly say my pain has done a complete 360! So happy with my choice of chiropractic care! I look forward to continuing my care here with Downtown Live Chiropractic! Big thank you to the team!< /Text>

Absolutely terrible. Booked an appointment at 4:30 and waited over 45 minutes before anyone even mentioned that they wouldn't be able to meet with me. Whats the point of booking an appointment if I have to wait 45 minutes just to be told we need to reschedule. Additionally they will wait to tell you that your insurance isn't accepted until AFTER your first visit which will cost you at-least $100. Will never return and would definitely not recommend to anyone no matter the circumstances.<//Text>

<Review>I always look forward to my appointments at Dr. Levon's practice! All of the receptionists and doctors have been super easy to get along with. I felt welcomed as soon as I walked in on my first day, and Dr. Levon has helped me immensely with my back issues, and more. I highly recommend Downtown Live Chiropractic, they are the best chiropractic service I've received.< /Review>< userid>

I was recommended to go see Dr. Levon when I was experiencing lower back pain. I was a little scared of getting adjusted, but turns out I had nothing to be afraid of. I felt noticeable improvement in my lower back after my first visit. He seems very experienced and gave me a lot of helpful tips to help with my pain. His staff is very friendly and welcoming.< /Review>

This is the best chiropractor I’ve ever been to. Dr Levon gives the best service and has helped me feel so much better after my car accident. I would definitely recommend him. The staff is also very nice and always help me if I have any questions. Best chiropractor ever if I could put 6 stars I would gladly do it !</text>

I have been skeptical about chiropractors after a few bad experiences and other people's stories,.
Everything started when I started getting about 3 migraine episodes a day, I had it before but after day 4 not being able to control the migraines with anything, a good friend recommended me to see Dr Levon, and made an appointment for me. I was so desperate that I went immediately since I could feel the migraine creeping up again.
The service was prompt, dr Levon is a really cool person, has a great positive attitude and makes you feel better right away, we chatted and he took me to get x-rays right away, he adjusted me,, and found the exact cause of my pain,, after the adjustments  I left without a migraine, very happy!
Of course I made another appointment,  and in a couple days I'm going to my 4th appointment,  migraines come and go, but shorter and way less intense , Dr Levon gave me many advices and helped me gain some migraine sanity 😅
In other visits I've met other patients who are getting amazing results.
I'd encourage anyone to go get checked out, the staff is awesome, they are super friendly and helpful<//text>

I first went to Dr. Levon back in 2012 and my back was out and busted, I'm a fitness coach and I thought I would never be able to run or jump again I was in so much pain. But Dr. Levon has the magical healing hands and the gift to heal the body, he set me free! The staff is great and everyone is so professional and friendly! I wouldn't tell you to go anywhere else this place is pure Magic!!!! I love it!</Text>

Great clinic in DownTown, LA. It was my first experience at a chiropractor. I decided to go after experiencing some lower severe back pain. They scheduled me right in (same day), had me do x-rays and then had me do a quick adjustment. I went in three days later to review the x-rays with the provider and I was shocked at how bad my spine looked in the xrays. Truly shocked. I would have never known...and I'm only 32!!! Great clinic, great staff, great location. The only con is that it gets busy...but this is actually a sign of good bussiness/medical practice. Definitely recommend.<//Review>

My second visit today with Dr. Levon and I’m beyond excited to start treatment with him, he carefully and throughly went over all my problem areas and with his attention and expertise sprinkled in with humor makes him my pick in trusting him with my life! Haha-no seriously! He’s great! Can’t wait to feel brand new after my treatments are over, Thank you Dr.! xx< /Review>

First of all I would like to thank Dr. Levon for everything he has done. I would also like to thank the entire team, since all of them know their practice and provide you with the best treatment and information when you most need it. I am pleased with everyone and everything that has been done to treat my back and neck problems prior to the accident I was involved. I have been provided with the best treatment by the hands of the chiropractor. I would definitely recommend Downtown Live whenever you need your chiropractic necessities.<//Review>

I used to see him at least 4-5 times a year the first few years to fix my acute spinal injury in my lower neck that was giving me massive pressure headache to my right side head.  He repaired me noticeably after the first visit.  Dr. Levon is very legit, he is very kind and really knows his stuff.   I've been to many chiropraticioners  in koreatown before Dr. Levon, but they just want your money and doesn't really care to fix you right.  I've sent many of my friends to this clinic, and they all agree he's very legit.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>Initially I decided to go this chiropractor mostly because a good friend of mine was going to see Dr. Levon. I knew the importance of going to a chiropractor, but had only gone to see one once before. I accompanied her and since it was my first visit they had to do the X-rays. I must admit, I didn’t think  they would come back too bad. At that time I had been having severe head and neck pain, and was not really connecting that to my nervous system. When I got the results I was so shocked by what they revealed. My spine had been misaligned for so long that my disks were already wearing off, specially those in my neck which would explain the neck pain. The curvature of my neck was also curving the complete opposite as its original position. My thoracic spine was also misaligned which as Dr. Levon explained could ultimately have a huge impact on my respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Because my thoracic spine was so misaligned the rest of my body was too. One of my shoulders was higher, as well as my leg on that same side. Since then I’ve been going every two weeks and I feel so much better. I have more energy, my headaches don’t occur as often and my overall health has improved significantly. Dr Levon and all the employees at the center have been very professional, kind, and friendly. I would recommend this place anytime.< /text>< Pics>

I never take the time to write reviews... but listen when I tell you, this Dr. works magic!  I have chronic spinal issues and I have undergone extensive treatment plans with a previous dr. In the Bay Area.  Since moving to LA a year ago, I have not found a chiropractic home and I am in pretty bad shape.  I found this dr. Online and tried him out as his review were great and I live 2 blocks away from his dt office.  He has an in office X-ray which was awesome and he did wonders during my adjustment.

I have had shoulder problems for years from dislocating in the past.  He did all new adjustments that I’ve never experienced before that worked some kind of manic on my left shoulder that released what feels like all of the pain I’ve held there for years.

Trust me, I am a chiropractic lifer with the amount of damage I have to my spine.  I know a great chiropractor when I meet one.  Do yourself a favor and make an appointment here.</review>

<Date>1561883396140<//Date><rate>5</rate><Text>I initially went to Dr. Levon to check on the general health of my spine since he was highly recommended by a friend. I’ve been consistent with my daily yoga practice for years, so I assumed it was in pretty good shape. To my surprise, he showed me that my right leg was two inches shorter than the left due to a misaligned pelvis, which explained why my shoes wore down unevenly. His adjustments were quick, painless, and dare I say... enjoyable! I was nervous about the neck adjustment but he uses a technique that is completely safe and does not twist the neck whatsoever. After the first adjustment, I felt like a new person and I’ve continued to feel better with each visit. Walking and running now feel weightless and I have been able to get much deeper in my yoga practice. My digestion has also improved along with my general posture. Everything just feels~ better! Needless to say... Dr. Levon is a chiropractic master w/ a lovely staff who I recommend to all my loved ones.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<text>One of the best places you can go to get adjusted. I highly recommend this place. The staff are awesome and treat you like family. They are super friendly and the nurse's are gorgeous. The whole vibe there is very positive.  The therapy is amazing and relaxing. I walked in one day with a massive migraine and did not want to get adjusted. But Dr. Insisted on the adjustment and in 5 min he completely removed my headache. I was amazed by what had happened.  He also adjusted my son and got rid of his fear of doctors. The doctor is very knowledgeable and holds great relationship's with each patients. I always leave satisfied and with positive energy. Plus it's right next to LA LIVE where I can have some drinks and food to complete the day. Thanks alot. 😎😁😉😜<//text>< Pics>

So accommodating and friendly, feels like they known you forever, been seeing Dr.Levon for years and he’s truly the best chiropractor I’ve ever had and won’t go anywhere else, knows exactly where my pain is every time and I feel so great when I leave. All the other doctors are great too, so you can’t lose ever! He’s made a huge difference in my pain management & I personally won’t recommend any else but them!< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I am so grateful & feeling a natural endorphin high from all the release ... it’s amazing how instant the comfort, I’m experiencing, happens after having an adjustment.
I drive a lot, and sleep wrong ... so my body is constantly getting out of whack! Going to the chiropractor is now a routine for me, and I’ve never felt better! It’s like going to the dentist; you don’t just go once! It’s so key to staying healthy as a whole! Thank you again, downtown LIVE Chiropractic! Very grateful for the adjustment!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Last week, I was on vacation, and I started to experience back pain and a really awful headache after only my first day in LA. It took me a few days to put two and two together, but soon enough, I figured out they were probably related. The next morning I called Downtown Live Chiropractic to make an appointment and they got me in that same morning! They took my x-rays and everything, and after an adjustment, I started to feel better immediately. It was incredible! Literally the next morning I woke up feeling like my old self and was finally ready to fully enjoy my trip! Beyond that, the chiropractor I saw also showed me several other things that aren't quite right with my back/spine/etc that I didn't even realize or know about. They went above and beyond! I can't thank everyone at Downtown Live Chiropractic enough. They were all incredibly nice and helpful. Amazing experience! :)</review>

<Review>Right off the bat, everyone here is very friendly. The staff provides a fun and positive environment to be around. Dr. Levon is great at what he does. Not only does he adjust my back, but he helps me be a healthier person overall. I always walk out of the office happy and light as a feather after my adjustments are done. If you're looking for a chiropractor, I believe this is the best place to be :)</Review>< username>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I highly recommend this establishment and Dr. Levon. Dr. Levon is a wonderful Chiropractor with a great personality. All the staff is friendly and very helpful in person and on the phone. I have never been to a health care setting where staff is as friendly or as amazing as Melissa, Yesenia, and Stacey. Please note: I got a treatment plan; they don’t have to be that nice they already have my business. Goes to show the work ethic at this establishment.

Whether you are making a last-minute appointment or re-scheduling, they are very accommodating. For those of you who work in Downtown, it is a great place to go before or after lunch/work, and they validate parking!

Now on to my experience. As mentioned, I got a treatment plan with them and I am very pleased with the care I receive. I started going when I was experiencing pain on most of my mid and upper body, due to the “desk life”; now I go in for maintenance and rarely experience pain. In addition, my pain limited the type of workouts I could do and losing the weight I had gained was tough. Now all my clothes fit again and I’m able to use the fitness equipment I had been staying away from. It is encouraging to be able to ask Dr. Levon if it’s safe for me to use a given machine at the gym. Furthermore, it is comforting to know that if I go too far with my workouts that Dr. Levon will be able to tell me how my body is handling it and of course, adjust me.

Since I started Dr. Levon has made me feel comfortable and somehow manages to always have a smile on his face. How is that even humanly possible?! He has always been receptive to my questions and concerns.

As a public health professional concerned about the opioid epidemic, it is refreshing to find a method to eliminate pain and heal your body without the use of pain medication. In addition, I really appreciated all the times I’ve heard Dr. Levon encouraging patients to live a healthy lifestyle. Thank you Dr. Levon for doing some of the public health work for us .<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>I highly recommend Downtown Live Chiropractic.  I was rear ended on the freeway and was left with excruciating back pain.  But after a few months of adjustments from Dr. Levon, my back pain has alleviated immensely.  Dr. Levon and his staff are extremely attentive to their patients and they truly want what is best for you.  He takes time listen to his patients’ concerns and goes out of his way to ensure we are receiving the right treatment and will adjust his techniques when necessary. If you are experiencing any pain, do not hesitate to visit Downtown Live! 10/10<//review>< rating>

All the staff members starting from clerks, assistants and certainly both doctors - Doctor Zeger and Doctor Levon are absolutely amazing. They truly care for your health and well-being in comparison to so many other places out there. I have been assisted by both doctors and needless to say, both of them are professionals- very knowledgable and caring people. I will feel very sad when I will need to stop visiting the place because I  am almost done with my recovery.  5 star and definately recommend!!<//Text><name>Victoria Valverde</name><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c7b794876cf5:0xb4265ff32b5bfa50<//gmap_id><Date>1574533014739< /Date></record></dataset><record>

I have been to chiropractors before, but not like this one. I was recommended by him by several peers of mine and I could not resist but to pay him a visit. Unlike most chiropractors that twist your neck, Dr. Levon adjusted me in a seated position without twisting my neck and he was very detail oriented. Not to mention that he's very educated and knows exactly what he's doing, this GENIUS taught me a lot about healthy eating habits and what I should do in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I felt at home and at peace throughout my entire visit. It was great to be in an office where it didn't feel like I was just another client. He truly cares about every single patient and does his best to ensure all possible satisfaction, physically and mentally. 100% recommended I would say, not to mention he's located in the heart of DTLA, and definitely plan on coming back!</review>

I’m not surprised DTLA has won the best chiropractor award in LA for 7 straight years. Dr. Levon has been my go to chiropractor for over 10 years. He doesn’t twist my neck like other chiros and he always takes his time to create the perfect treatment plan. I feel a million times better and I will most definitely recommend him to anyone who is in need of chiropractic care.</text>

I was only in LA for one night for business and my neck was killing me for the last three days.  I had never been to a chiropractor before but figured I'd give it a shot to feel better.  I'm glad I did!  Dr. Levon got me in the office very quickly in the time I had available for an appointment.  He was professional and went over everything he was going to do before he performed the adjustment.

Even though he knew I was not going to be a repeat customer, since I was only in town for business, he still treated me very professionally and friendly.  If I was in the area I would have become a repeat customer.

I highly recommend Dr. Levon to anyone who needs short term pain relief or a long term solution to better themselves.<//review>

Dr Levon is really good, very knowledgeable, all the staff is great.i've been coming more than 5 years, just had my second car accident and had to come back, I recommend you get a lawyer if you've been in a serious accident and then come see them but they also offer payment plans so you can get a bundle deal< /Review>

Dr. Levon is great. He takes time to explain the source of your discomfort and what he's about to do to make it better. I was a bit skeptical of chiropractors before I decided to go see Dr. Levon. I guess I'm a chiro convert now. The results were noticeable. I didn't get better overnight (he's not a miracle worker!), but I felt a little better after each visit, and now I'm back to normal.

If you're looking for a chiropractor, I would highly recommend Dr. Levon. He and the entire staff are very friendly and accommodating.<//review>

<Review>This is not a review about the doctor. I never got to actually meet him and I’m sure he is great. This review refers to the staff I recently spoke too. I have scoliosis and was recently in an accident and was looking for a chiropractor for a consolation to find out why I was feeling pain and if it had affected my scoliosis. As soon as I told them it was from a accident it was no longer about my health but about the payment that was going to occcur from the insurance. I understand this is a business and they need to get paid for their sevices. The First Lady I spoke to was nice and told me I can still have a consolation with the doctor which is what I wanted in the first place. But then she told me to hold to see if they can take me for treatment because I was going though the other persons insurance. Then another lady got on the phone and she asked me if was going through the other party’s insurance I said yes. Then she proceed to ask if I had an attorney and I said “no my insurance just told me to go seek medical help.” Mind you i was not yet seeking treatment I just wanted a diagnosis at that point. She then told me, “we can’t see you with out an attorney.” Keeping in mind what the other lady had just told me I said, “ I have scoliosis and I’m in pain I just want to know if I’m okay”. And then she kept explaining about the attorney and the insurance and payment. I that point I was so upset I just said okay and that I would go somewhere else. I never write reviews but I was really upset with the whole situation. And shocked that at the end of the day it was all about money.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2c7b794876cf5:0xb4265ff32b5bfa50< /GmapID></record>

<text>For about the last 20 years I've seen about 8-10 different chiropractors at a couple different chiropractic schools and several clinics. Dr. Levon Nalbandyan at Downtown Live Chiropractic is one of the best! I've learned that he uses a specific technique called Gonstead. Only a few chiropractors in LA practice this method! Its a very effective and advanced technique that only a very small amount of chiropractors are able to learn successfully. I personally find that this technique is very effective with correcting sports injuries and relieving chronic pain. Along with his treatment and diagnosis and corrective procedures, he also tells you about which stretches and exercises to do to help you maintain your body's alignment between adjustments. What's great is that I feel an immediate relief right after each adjustment. And most of his patients have significant improvement within a month. I'm definitely recommending anybody to pick  him as your chiropractor if you want to start healing and realigning your body. I workout intensely on a high level with free weights and body weight exercises to build muscle so my weekly visits are important to help maintain correct posture and help my muscles recover while in alignment. Don't be surprised if there's no empty chairs  in the waiting area...he has a constant flow of daily patients!</text><Time>1538157102325</Time>< GmapID>

I cannot speak highly enough of Dr. Levon!

If you're looking for a chiropractor who honestly cares about your well-being than Dr. Levon is your guy. At the start of your session he'll always ask first if you have any specific areas of pain he should work on and if not, he'll give you the works which can be accomplished in about 10 mins. I've always left feeling like a million bucks.

I've known Dr. Levon for years and its amazing to see how much his practice has grown. Just spend 15 mins. in the waiting room and you'll see people in/out consistently.

Do yourself a favor and book an appointment, its so worth it! And tell him Diana Tran sent you! =)</Review>

< Review>
I arrived LA with lower back pain after a non stop flight of 16 hours. I was having hard time getting off the bed or standing and  brushing my teeth in the morning.
I know I have been complaining about my back for over 8 year but this time it is different.
I searched for a nearby Chairopractic and found good reviews for Dr. Levon clinic.
I felt relieven from the first visit and felt much better.
Thank you Dr.Levon

(Translated by Google) I recommend physical therapy here!!!!
From the left face and the right of the neck several months ago
I was very uncomfortable
I was treated by Dr Levon twice in a month.
The effect was very good
I think it’s physical therapy, but this is
I think it’s the best. The staff are friendly.
In the future, I will visit only here in the future :)
Thank you again

여기 물리치료 강추 !!!!
왼쪽 안면 과 목 오른쪽 수개월 전부터
많이 불편 했는데
Dr Levon 한테서  한달동안 2 번 치료 받았는데
효과가 아주 좋았어요
제생각에는 물리치료하는데 여기가
최고인것 같에요 스테프들도 친절 하고요
앞으로 쭈욱 여기만 개속 방문 :)
다시 한번 감사드립니다< /text>

(Translated by Google) There are no words to explain how the knowledge of a human being who puts himself at the service of others is able to heal with such simplicity a pain that you have been carrying for days. As I did not come before. You can only feel Gratitude.

So glad we stopped...this is what your grandma would call a coffee shop.  Local pastries, great coffee and local  artist's work adorning the walls made for a pleasant escape from the everyday.......< /text>

stopped here on the way from here to there, with my husband and 3 year old.
Order at the counter, they bring the food to you.

Service was so very friendly, and the food was way better than I'd hoped for when stopping on a roadtrip. Simple but yummy sandwiches, served with a smile, and they made me the most wonderful cafe borgia.

Will definitely come back next time we blow through Oakdale.</Review>

They have some Unique candies...and some unique flavors that I have never heard of before.  But majority of the candies there are ones you can get from the convenience store.<//text>

<text>We got some chocolate covered raisins, licorice, and butterscotch candy. The raisins were REALLY bad, ended up tossing them out. Both the raisin and the chocolate just didn't taste well and the texture was unusual in a bad way. The rest was normal I guess maybe below average considering its a candy shop.

The shop itself is nice, might give it another chance in the future.< /text>< pics>

<Text>Stopped here every year growing up with my family and cousins. Everyone would get a giant jaw breaker to see who could eat it fastest and I would always get my candy stolen by one of my siblings/cousins (Especially the large gummy snake). Still some of the best family memories as a kid. I look forward to going back!<//Text>< pictures>

This is such a fun candy store! Sometimes when you go in you can watch them making the taffy. The fudge here is delicious. Most of the candy is priced by weight.< /text>

This is a must stop shop for anyone visiting Old Town. Every time we visit San Diego, we make a point of stopping in and watching the staff hand spin, stretch and package taffy - it's very cool and you can't stop watching. On top of that, there's a huge variety of other candies and treats, many which you don't see everywhere. A cool stop for anyone who loves candy, that's for sure.</Text>

Fun place. Take a basket and wander the store. Lots of choices from jelly beans to rock candy to amazing fudge. Watching them make taffy is cool.<//review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Walked in just to look around.  On my right hand side there were 2 ladies working on the Taffy candy.  Tried the “Cinnamon Taffy” and thought I love Cinnamon and it probably won’t be that good.  Boy, was I wrong!
I fell in love with it.  Bought a half bag., and it was gone in 5 minutes.  Definitely, trying to stay away from sweets.  Thought about taking the Amtrack back down there today just to get some more of this Cinnamon taffy.  Trying to order online.  Thanks, great shop👍<//text><pics>None< /pics><time>1554091365302< /time><Gmap_id>0x80deaaddf836a199:0xa0c23297c2f73736<//Gmap_id><user_id>104367717698812762757</user_id>< resp>

This is definitely my favorite fund raising website. The options are endless, so I can find something for everyone. It's also one of the few places that actually send you a free candy to cover shipping cost, this helped me out a lot when I wanted to make the most money out of my sales.</Review>

This place is a favorite for my family, the kids always want to go here, especially when Nana & Papa are around. A variety of sweet treats and goodies. Would recommend you stop in if you are walking by. The satff are supper friendly and will let you try samples of the taffy. Last visit, I watched the employees load the taffy machine and what a chore that was. Whoever designed that machine did it before work comp was ever a thing. Would definitely recommend to a friend.</Review>

A real interesting place for an Asian tourist like me who has always been curious about the salt water  taffy that Ross (of Friends) loves so much. And there is something nostalgic about  being amidst these traditional confectionaries, especially when greeted warmly by staffs in 19th century attire.</Text>

I just spent $5 on the WORST salt water taffy ever.  The taffy was very hard (old?) and none of them had flavor.  The caramel was ok but I threw out the rest.  I would have returned the purchase if I still had been in the shopping area.  No one else was in the shop and it's no wonder.  NOW the owner added that they weren't open at the time of purchase.  I have a receipt.  Also, I was NEVER offered ANY samples.  I even had to ask where a bag was to collect my candy for purchase.  This is not a BOGUS complaint.  I am a Certified Travel Counselor and travel writer.  I write reviews all of the time.<//review>

<Text>Very cute candy shop in the heart of San Diego's Old Town. The employees are bedecked in late 1800's attire while pedaling sweet treats like fudge, homemade taffy, and an assortment of penny candy (priced for today's economy). You can also find some uncommon candies that quickly bring back childhood memories (think caramel creams).  #SanDiego #OldTown #Candy #SweetTooth< /Text><Rating>4</Rating><Name>Paige Levin< /Name>< gmap_id>

Employees are so rude and disrespectful. The kids working her are NOT HELPFUL and try very hard to find a way to not help you. Candy selection is the same as any mall candy shop except higher priced here.</text>

(Translated by Google) Special store to buy many sweets, some made by themselves, have a good variety, too bad that the sugar is not so good for health, I bought several sweets

(Original)
Tienda especial para comprar muchos dulces, algunos hechos por ellos mismos, tienen buena variedad, lástima que el azúcar no sea tan buena para la salud, igual me compré varios dulces<//Review>

I'm from out of town, showed up to rent a bike. In less than 15 mins I was out the door with a great bike, helmet, lock, and free local knowledge of where to bike to and what streets to use. Excellent customer service, thanks for the tips!< /text>

< Review>
i've been a customer of this shop for about 18 years.  this review is for their service department.

i had a brand new made to order steel frame that needed a chris king bottom bracket installed.  the BB has a large cup size (threadfit 30) that requires a special tool....one that i didn't have at the time.  they charged me $30 for the install.

i built my bike up and got half way up Emma.  i heard the creaking and grinding from the BB and also started to feel it through the pedals.  it was focking horrible and cringe inducing.  i stopped to examine and found that both of the BB cups were loose.  now of course i felt the cups before i continued my build, but with not having the tool, i couldn't really test it.  i trusted the bike trip to install the $200 bottom bracket to spec....with 40 Nm of torque.  clearly that didn't happen.  now i'm wondering if my brand new bottom bracket's bearings are now also toast.

in the past, i've known all the service managers and wrenches and felt very confident in the level of skill and care provided to my bikes.  that is no longer the case.  i don't think i'll let anyone from there touch my bikes again unless Nate or old Phil come back.  it's a shame too cause they are my closest bike shop.

Best service team in town.  I have never in dozens of times had to return a bike for a service issue.  If you want it done correctly the first time get you work done here.   I bring in a clean bike every time.  No one likes working on a dirty bike.< /Review>

From the other review it seems this place has good rental service, but stay away if you are looking for parts. I came in on a Saturday morning, and was the only customer in the store with 6 employees standing around. They hide all of their parts behind the counter in the service department, and the employee helping(?) me kept asking me why I wanted each part. Just get out of the way and let me pick out my own dang chain! I also paid 6 bucks for a single strip of rim tape, which is outrageous.< /review>

< Review>
This review will receive only one star which I feel is 1 too many.  On presidents day I called to find out whether I could have two tires put on my bike. I was told "no problem, come on in. It will cost $15 per wheel." When I arrived the 1st thing that came out of the mechanics mouth was "do you have an appointment".  I explained to him that I had called just a few minutes earlier and was told that there would be no problem. He asked who did I speak with. I said I believe his name was Mike. He said there is no Mike that works here. At that point an individual from the shop walks over to asked a question and was referred to as Mikey.  Reluctantly,  upon realizing that I heard him say Mikey instead of Mike he decided to work on my bike .  After removing both wheels and the old tires I had on the bike he opened up the package that I had given to him only to realize that they were the wrong size. I agreed to buy a pair of tires from him after realizing my error. Moments later another individual and his 2 sons approached the same counter and asked if they too could have their new tires put on their bike that were not purchased from their store.They were not asked if they had an appointment, making me feel, as a black man,   uncomfortable, to say the least. When he completed my job I was taken to the front desk to pay.  To my surprise I was being charged $20 per tire. When I pointed out that I was quoted it would be $15 per tire, the excuse was that because I have an E bike they had to remove numerous wires to install the tires. I pointed out to him that my bike  was a mid drive meaning simply that there were no wires to remove and that the  wheels on my bike would be no different than any other bicycle to remove and replace.  Reluctantly  he gave me the benefit of the doubt and charged me $15 per tire as agreed upon originally. I even pointed out to him that I purchased the tires from his store.  Given my experience I would not recommend this store to anyone<//Review>

< review>
I had a bad experience here recently. I changed the pads on my hydraulic brake system and accidentally allowed some air in to the closed system. I didn't have the proper bleed kit and I had never bled bike brakes before, so I took it to the Bicycle Trip where I had been to before without any complaints. I asked them to bleed the rear brake system and they said it would be done by the end of the day if they were able to do a simple (I think they said lever bleed). At the end of the day they said they needed to keep it over night because it needed a more comprehensive block bleed. I agreed, stating that I wanted the job done right. They had my bike all of the next day, and just before closing I went to pick my bike up. The mechanic told me that they couldn't get all of the air out of the system due to too many adapters which have a tendency to trap air in hard to bleed pockets. They still charged me $30 and said there was nothing more they could do. Let's think about this for a second. How is it that they couldn't bleed my system properly? When I got the bike new 10/2018 everything was perfect, so obviously a proper brake bleed was not impossible to accomplish. They claimed that it wasn't their fault because I was the one who changed the brake pads. Well they admitted to me that they had sanded the brake pads as part of the job, but the pads were literally brand new. I had installed them the night before. So when I got my bike back, after two days for a simple rear brake bleed I couldn't even lock the rear wheel up to skid. They never should have sanded the 1 day old brake pads, and they admittedly couldn't even bleed the brakes correctly. I ended up replacing the pads again, and the brakes work well enough to skid, but the brake lever is still "mushy" due to an incomplete $30 job that they admitted they couldn't fully bleed correctly. Why charge me if they can't do the job, and in the process they also cost me another $10 for new pads. In conclusion, I bought new pads and even though the brake lever is a little mushy, I can once again skid to a stop if needed. I'm buying a bleed kit from amazon and I'm pretty confident that I'll be able to bleed the system better than the $30 job that they did poorly. I will admit that a week later I went in there a bit drunk and called them out on their piss-poor work and got myself kicked out. I had that coming, but they have this review coming because if they had done the job right, or simply said they were incapable and not charged me then everything would be fine with me. They shouldn't say they weren't able to do the job properly and still take my money. I took it to a shop to have it done right, gave them all the time they needed, and they took my my money after they failed to complete the job.<//review>

We had a flat tire and went to the store on Sunday afternoon. They fixed it right away. Didnt take long. Cost was reasonable.  That was a nice experience.  We had enough time left for some biking.< /review>

This is a great bicycle shop. I have purchased several bikes from them over the years and have all of my repair work done in their shop. Prices are competitive and there is reasonable variety in their stock for a medium-sized store. The repair people are prompt and give accurate time estimates for the work. I have had nothing but good experiences here.</Review>

The Bicycle Trip not only delivers excellent service and parts, it also plays a instrumental role in the bike culture and community here in Santa Cruz. From hosting workshops, supporting the Jr. Development team, bike fest as part of Bike Week, and supporting community initiatives they do it all. The staff are kind, knowledgeable, and eager to help out. I highly recommend this shop to anyone and everyone.< /Text>

< Review>
Top Notch! The team at the Bike Trip has been been putting up with me for over 20 years! From my BMX era to the Road. This team is awesome. Always friendly, extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Most recently they have made my cycling experience even greater by partnering up with Dave at BeFit Consultants to offer a full cycling experience. Thank you Bike Trip for continuing to offer the absolute best.</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I'm in the bike industry and this is the shop I send friends to and I go to when I need something in a pinch. The shop is welcoming whether you're deeply knowledgeable or don't know much about bikes. They're friendly and unintimidating. Their mechanics are great. Just now, they sold me a tube and lent me tools from back in the shop so I could DIY the repair outside.

They also carry my favorite commuter bike brand, Momentum, which is an excellent value and fun bike. My girlfriend and several other friends ride and love it.

Thanks, Bike Trip!</review><Gmap_id>0x808e401ecaf695b9:0xc90872dd83b17f65<//Gmap_id><date>1521828235955</date><Pictures>None< /Pictures><UserId.>106925052742482199521</UserId.><user_name>Gregory Sanders<//user_name></record>

<rating>2< /rating><text>I Brought my bike in to have the brakes adjusted, because they where squeaking and when I returned to pick it up it was obvious at a glance that the breaks where installed incorrectly and would squeal horribly. They where set at well more than a 15 degree angle to the rim so that only one edge could ever touch the rim.  To make things worse the rear breaks where angled the wrong direction! Cantilever Breaks are supposed to be installed with a slight angle so that as the break grips it pulls the trailing edge toward the rim allowing the full pad to be used, these breaks where installed to that only the very edge of the pad could ever be used preventing anything close to full effectiveness of the breaks

When I rode back into the store from the test ride the breaks where so loud the other customers had to cover their ears. After they took another shot at adjusting them and putting different breaks pads on the result of the second test ride was exactly the same, and ear splitting squeal. The second star in this review comes from the fact that the third test the breaks only squeaked very slightly at the very end of a stop, which is acceptable.

When I have adjusted the same breaks in the past my self (which took a couple hours to get right) they worked fine, I took it in this time to same my self the time and instead had to sit in the store for an hour so I lost both the time and money.

While in the process of fixing the breaks, for no reason I can tell, they unmounted my front light and put it back on pointing about 30 degrees to the right and hanging down with a really poorly done tape job? They agreed not to charge me for the break pads by way of compensation which, although annoying, does show willingness to correct mistakes.

This shop seems well suited to buying new bikes and they have perfectly good prices on parts, though I can only recommend avoiding them for repairs.</text>< Resp>

Really bummed about my expiereance with this bike shop. I went in there to pick up some tires, and one of the employees started telling me i dont want these tires and everyone uses this other tire blah blah blah!! i told him this is want i want, not what everyone eles wants. Then he started telling me how bad the tire i want are. I walked out without losing my cool on that nerd! Will never go there again</review>

This mall can't get any traction for the businesses here. A few years ago the owners left the pipes running through the underground parking unmaintained for years and you could smell sewage there. They fixed it since but the reputation was cemented. Restaurants changed very frequently. The Japanese restaurant is doing good weekend business. The Chinese banquet restaurant on the top floor closed and a new one has since opened (Tang Cong) 唐宫。Have not tried that out. The after school academies, KTV, and panic room seem to be getting some traction. There's hope for this building.<//Text>

<text>This plaza used to be the place where young people hang out back in the 90s before the affluent Asians had moved to other neighborhood, but it is half dead now.  Most shops are vacant and only a handful restaurants remain open.  I still come here may be once every few years for a banquet at the Empress Seafood Restaurant on the top floor.
There are limited parking outside and underground.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The newly opened Tang Palace Restaurant is moderately priced. The service is the worst in the department. The most prudent attitude is to respond to the guests. The training is divided into large and medium-sized points, but it is the same as the small abalone. I have a sour taste, I hope that there is abalone abalone like a nail file. It’s a new business, but if you improve it, it’s a bit of a spoof.

新開張的唐宮酒樓 食物價錢 適中 服務普通 最差係門口帶位 用最差嘅態度 應對客人 一啲訓練都冇 分大中小點但係熱嘅點心得一樣係 小點 鮑魚 糯米雞 好難食有酸味唔好期望有鮑魚鮑魚好似指甲咁細 新開張有生意但如果唔改善都幾惡搞</Text><user>104420978805321499422<//user>< username>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It was very popular in the past, and it is now deserted, because many stores are closed with locks - empty. Unfortunately.

<text>Going here feels like going to a family gathering. The Barbers seem to genuinely like  each other and they make their customers feel like they are at a family get together. We have always gone to whoever is available and have never been disappointed. The Barbers not only make you feel good but look great. The owner has created a modern down home Barbers shop, I highly recommend this place.<//text><UserId.>105146593585973446068<//UserId.>< GmapID>

Great location near my house. I've been going to Carlos religiously after my first haircut here. Atmosphere is always positive, the shop is completely clean and all the barbers make you feel welcome. Reasonably priced and the quality is 5 Stars. Definately ask for Carlos. (Although they all cut great) 👍👍👍</review>

Best barbershop 💈 in town. I got cut by Victor and he did an incredible job. He did exactly what I ask. I was watching the other barbers and they were doing great work as well. Great customer service, clean shop...10/10< /Text>

Best barbers in the 209. Feels professional and comfortable. Just opened, can't wait to see what more they have in store. (UPDATE) Business is doing great and some barbers get fully booked, I recommend making an appointment in advance. Great music, people, and environment overall.<//Review>

This particular Du-par's is very nostalgic because it is located right near Hollywood.  Celebrities come in occasionally and it has been here since 1938.  It was especially fun for my husband and I to visit this past early morning Black Friday 2016, because we hadn't been there since 1982 after just seeing E.T. at a nearby theatre.  I do have to say, that the only reason I am giving it a 4 star, my tri-tip dinner plate was not as good as the Du-par's in Pasadena.  The meat was definitely over cooked. Their pancakes were outstanding as usual, but my dinner was not that great.</Text>

Good home style food served here with lousy service. I've never hear a bad plate here except for this muffin but the service is the worst. You have to flag down any waiter/waitress just to place an order. Then you feel like you're asking them for the biggest favor ever. Don't come here if you're in a hurry. Also, while another customer was flagging down a waitress she loudly exclaimed,  "I'm not your waitress!".</Review>

Had breakfast here and was very pleased. Good to see a place keep its roots and also stay with the times. Surreal feeling knowing Elvis might have sat in the same booth as me. Pancakes are to die for :)<//text>

<text>Du-par's Restaurant & Bakery, Studio City, California

A friend had actually taken ME there almost two (2) weeks ago and I really enjoyed their food.

I therefore decided to return back there last weekend and had a Very Enjoyable Dining Experience!

For Lunch:  I had USDA Prime New York Steak, along with a Garden Salad, Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice since that is one of My Favorite Juices with a very Delicious Strawberry Cream Pie for Dessert.

During my Dining Room experience I also had the opportunity to meet Drew Carey who was enjoying his Lunch there as well and so You Never Know Who You Are Going To Meet at Du-par's Restaurant & Bakery!

I was very much Impressed with the Food and the Service received by Walter, one of their Lead Waiters who has been with the restaurant for a very long time!

I want to personally Thank Frances Tario for Inviting ME back to the restaurant and Walter, the Lead Waiter for providing ME with Fantastic, Top Notch Du-Par's Restaurant & Bakery Dining Services and for Helping Me Make My Youtube Video back on Saturday, November 4, 2017.

Sincerely yours,

<text>Stopped by and had the Monte Cristo. Made French bread style without all the extra fat from frying. Raspberry jam with chunks of raspberry was an excellent compliment to a really good meal. Cole slaw with pineapple was really good.
Pedro was our waiter. He provided excellent service. The music and whole restaurant was very inviting.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Worst ever customer service for a $20 breakfast!  The only person who can resolve issues is the manager, Frances & she only works from 11-2pm & happens to be busy or conveniently steps out during those hours.  She doesn't return messages.    No wonder there were only a few customers in there.   Sandra & the other servers w/poor attitude have prob been there forever.  Not worth the price-- IHOP has better pancakes & basic customer service skills.</Text>< Pictures>

Du-pars is a mainstay of Studio City.  I grew up going there on many Sundays.  To this day I still come because the food is good and reasonably priced.  The parking lot can be very busy due to the shopping center, so get there a few minutes early if you are meeting someone at peak hours.  try it, I think you will like it if you like diners.<//Text>

Breakfast 24/7. A little pricey, but the pancakes are why people come here. Perfect for your after concert meal (read: late night/early morning dining).</text>

CANNOT go wrong with a short stack and a side of crispy bacon. My favorite thing - sides of warm melted butter and syrup served along side plate size pancakes, fresh off the griddle! DE-VINE!!!<//review>

Food was delicious as always, unfortunately the server was rude and barely came to my table to at least ask how the food is. She seemed to have an attitude as well. Only issue I had with the food was that two of the full stack pancakes were really undercooked but overall, it was a good experience. I definitely recommend Du-Pars in Pasadena.</review>

<review>They have the best pancakes that I ever had by far. But the prices are outrageously high for the kind of food they have there and the service is extremely hit or miss at both the Studio City and Encino locations. So I just go there only for the pancakes and French Toast and put up with the sporty service.</review>< Pics>

Well... I haven't been here since Junior High, and that was around 1975. I have been to the Farmer's Market location, and this is not that. Though the wait staff was generally Ok, it's the food that left a bad taste. Billed as fresh, and made by hand, the Veggie burger was dry and hard, just like the bun. There was nothing that could have redeemed this sandwich, though the fries gave it a shot. DuPars is known for many things, but the Veggie burger is not one of them. And there's a very good reason...<//review>

<text>My first & last visit to Dupars restaurant in Studio City Ca
I purchased a steak for $26.75  for take out after  I got home to
give it to a eldlerly friend it had too much grizzle in it , the mash potatoes was so watery very bland with gravy mixed in with it , that my friend didn't want to eat any of after slicing it and seeing all of the grizzle in it.  I returned it the next day and was told that the manager would be in the next day and a refund  would take 48 hrs. Today is Saturday 1/21/17 the manager has refused to the or contact me, I called yesterday and was told that they do not refund your money . after leaving four messages. they also placed a $3.00 tip on a take out order . Also Beware of the bill before you sign it they have a Statement on the bill that Say, I agree to pay the total amount according to the card issue agreement. the total for the steak of $26.75 total became$32.65.the food was awful ,t heir specialty is Bakery perhaps that where need to stay focused<//text>< Time>

It's not as bad as people say.  Farmer's Market food is generally sub par, but Du-Pars has some tasty classic dishes. (Meat loaf, motza ball soup) Breakfast is good also.  Just stay away from the happy hour dinner deals...they're disgusting.</review>

<review>One of the worst restaurants I have ever been to. Food (I had a burger) is subpar. They charged me over $6 (!) for a small, McDonald's-quality milkshake. Worst of all, though, my friend's food came with a used, dirty plate stuck underneath it. Somehow, the restaurant did not have a manager or assistant manager on duty (!) to report the issue.

SO many better food options in LA.< /review><response>None</response><date>1416175321669< /date><Rating>1< /Rating>< user>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Review>Horrible breakfast experience. burnt food (toast, sausage, eggs)- rubbery pancake for my son. Ignored by staff, and an overall bad experience on Christmas morning. This place was great years ago, but it has changed. not to mention that a 2 egg breakfast with sausage and toast is now about $13-. Guess you don't always get what you pay for.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

The food was ok... Like our French toast were squished and felt old. Then my hash browns were so burned they almost disappeared. Our waitress was so rude she threw our check and never came back as soon as she brought the last plate of food.<//review>

Horrible food and SUPER slow service, from surly, old robotic hags, and when the "food" finally arrives its usually a small portion that looks like an ape cooked it, and you can grow a beard by the time you get a coffee refill....BUT your check will be big and healthy, since its ridiculously overpriced.. It's gone in the toilet over the last 30 years, and ive been eating there over 50 years, and every time I leave I  say "never again", and a year or so later we go back hoping it has improved, and it never does...All these sugary sweet reviews about "great service"and "yummy delicuous food" are FAKES, written by shills or employees. Go to Good Neighbor up on Cahuenga, they care about their customers and food quality and presentation, and are reasonably priced.<//review>

Food delicious as always but today's service was very bad, that's why I gave it 4 stars.  We've been here several times and service has been good but today both the waitress and assistant very bad.  We usually go to the one in Pasadena, there the service is always excellent but we wanted to try a different location for a change. We will continue going to the Pasadena location instead.<//Review>

Greasy, frozen reheated food, nothing was made fresh - not at all what I was expecting from a diner.  Very slow and confused service.  Not a place that I would actually recommend to anyone, except if they were hungover and needed something to absorb the alcohol.< /Review>

The pizza hut there is horrible. Cold food after waiting hours. The management does not have any experience. If I could give a -5 I would. Also the fact that they behave as if they are doing something for you is a even worse issue. Customer service??? Please.< /text>

<review>What began as a minor love affair where I would stop between clients when I needed a quick coffee and bite, soon evolved into a strong relationship where I relinquished my avalanching Starbucks addiction. Little Ground Cafe has found its strength in not just top notch coffee, or delicious seasonal food items, but within the heart of it's staff which both sees efficiency and genuine kindness. If it is your first time may I recommend a latte and a pastry, or maybe a Pulled Pork Burrito if you are running out the house and skipped breakfast. Lunch? No problem! This cafe has a variety of different consistent options as well as three to four seasonal options to meet your palettes standard. One thing is for sure...I love Little Ground!</review><Name>Quenten Millhauser< /Name><Rate>5< /Rate></record>

I've tried every breakfast item but always come back to the quiche. The side salad and dressing gives it that fine touch💯. I finally made it since lockdown!  Customer service has lacked in the past yet never deterred me from coming since the baked goods are worth it. Today they've redeemed themselves.  May Little Ground prosper during these hard times.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKrMYv3dgn0JHIu7O2qI382QJkmxUeMMqw8YS8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

I had the pulled pork burrito. It's was great greasy goodness. An iced oatmilk latte washed it down nicely. They have healthy options too.</text>

If it hadn’t been for a quick lunch break a delicious brioche sandwich and wonderful smile I May have gone my entire life not knowing about Little Ground, and that would’ve been a bad thing. This restaurant, small and tucked away near the Imagineering Disney campus has completely taken me by surprise. The staff are incredibly energetic friendly and answer any questions I had about the menu and the service was incredibly fast as well as delicious and visually stunning. thank you little ground staff!< /review>

Little Ground Cafe is a quaint and delightful way to start your busy day. My fiancé and I stopped here for a quick breakfast before work, and Little Ground Cafe hit all the marks!

Their outdoor patio seating area coupled with the ordering window creates a relaxing atmosphere to dine at.

My wife got teddy bear latte art on a matcha latte. How cool is that? She loved it.

Both the coffee and food are cheap and on point. The $6.25 braised pork breakfast burrito.

Overall, I'd recommend Little Ground Cafe for a chill, quick, and inexpensive way to start the day!</text>

Thought my review went in. Argh! Y'know for having a "smart" phone it can be a little dim sometimes. But I digress.

To the matter at hand...what I meant to write was that Jimmy's Super Lunch sure has changed. But it's looking really tasty! Nice job! Also is it still possible to bowl a couple of frames at what used to be Grand Central Bowl across the street?

I think a Rockford Files episode or two was filmed there! 1970s. Copper colored Trans Am. Lots of orange barstools and earth-toned clothes. What a time to be alive!</Text>

This is an awesome little find. I really like stopping by here when I’m in town to get a quick bite to eat. They have pretty healthy food and the service is friendly. The only thing is the parking, but I am always able to find a spot. It’s never too busy so that’s great. I highly recommend this place to anyone for a healthy bite to eat.<//review>

Great little coffee shop,as is readily evidenced by the seemingly endless slew of car rushing up to the curb in the morning.  There is a really nice little patio area to enjoy your snacks on site,which does a great job of sequestering itself from it's environs as you would never know how much traffic is passing through that intersection always< /Review>

<username>Courtney Kobata</username><Rating>5<//Rating><Response>None< /Response><review>Has that great coffeeshop vibe. There is no indoor seating, so might want to take your coffee to go on a hot day. I love their iced mocha, it has the perfect amount of chocolate flavor, and keeps me going the rest of the day. I would recommend their breakfast burrito, it's super filling and quite delicious. The staff are nice, and they keep the outdoor seating area very clean.< /review>< Pics>

I LOVE Little Ground! The people are so nice, both the staff and the customers. I'm not gonna lie, I just started working there 2 weeks ago. But I have only seen quality, high ethics, and kindness behind the counter. I found them only a couple weeks before I applied, and have loved working here. (No, no one told me to write this! :)
I am a baker and I am proud of our pastries! items, from-SCRATCH croissants, made with ORGANIC flour. Talk about quality, if you have one, you will be hooked so be warned! But it's SO worth the calories! The Stumptown Coffee is handled with care, and I see so much passion behind each cup made. I have eaten about half the menu so far and everything is amazing, fresh, and the cooks are fast! So much to say, but you gotta just go see for yourself. Enjoy!<//Text>

Kind of a trendy place. Food is good. Fairly broad menu items for breakfast and lunch. It's a little pricey. But the food is good. I ordered the cubano. It came with a salad. Food was great. Small quaint seating area. They also have a cold brew available.<//Review>

This is one of the best little coffee places in Glendale. They are only open during the week days and conform their hours to nearby business establishments. The baked goods are worth a try and the coffee is always made correctly. Skip Starbucks and give this place a try...< /Review>

I love stopping by this place during the week on my way to ABC for business. It always makes my mornings and afternoons cheerful. Delicious bakery goods and quality coffee drinks. Mmm... buttermilk biscuits... Two things on my wish list? 1) They were open Saturday mornings. 2) They had larger sizes of iced drinks.< /Text>

<Review>So far I had a great tasting latte (couple of months ago).
Just recently revisited and got lunch(es) lol
The turkey sandwich and kale salad are delicious and both are shareable. They serve a good amount for a reasonable price. The baking goods are yummy as well.
Give a try and visit them soon!

Boujie little coffee for your boujie little job across the street. They make a mean coffee. Place smells like baked goods.

This section of Flower Street is dominated by private commercial property (namely film studio offices), so Little Ground is a welcome addition to an otherwise homogeneous area. For anyone working in the vicinity, it's a great way to take a break and stretch your legs on break, or provide a nice change of venue for a quick, small meeting.

Wifi is available and free. Parking can be tricky -- there is temporary parking directly out front, but anyone looking to sit down will probably want to seek out curb on one of the residential side streets. Bicycling would be a great choice; there is dedicated bike lane on the stretch of Sonora leading up to the shop.

All of Little Ground's seating is outdoor, but well-shielded from the noise of traffic by walls, and from beating sun by canopy. My main regret is that they're not open on weekends -- I realize the bulk of their business comes from the Monday through Friday working crowd, but that patio would be a fantastic place to hole up with a laptop on a Saturday afternoon!<//Text>

<Text>This was my first time visiting The Smile Artist and I was not disappointed. I sent them a message through their website on Sunday and was reached the following day. Although, I was not treated there for a wisdom tooth I had wanted to get treated they did refer me to a nearby office for treatment on the same week. I will definitely keep coming here for future treatment.< /Text><user_name>S S</user_name><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Sparkling clean, sophisticated, bright and modern dentist office with supportive and friendly staff. All the forms are digital as is the individual dental record and x-rays. I had laser treatment to clean my gums. The staff took pictures of my teeth and gums so I could see before/after and they added it to my record. The staff explained what insurance will cover/not cover, walked me through everything. Excellent service. I will be moving in six months and wish I knew about them when I first came to LA.</Text>

<review>If I had to describe the Smile Artists' approach to dentistry in one word it would be "thorough". I've moved around a lot in my life and seen my fair share of dentists through each move. After seeing Dr. Assudani and her team for multiple visits, I'm now rethinking my definition of "good dentists" from my past. From my very first exam/cleaning, their team was very welcoming and answered all of my questions with very thoughtful and insightful answers. After learning there was a gap in an old crown of mine, Dr. Assudani and Sam proposed a comprehensive plan to not simply quickly replace it, but to address multiple concerns I had in a phased approach that will get me to a more long-term solution. The office space is modern, clean, and set up with extensive Covid-19 precautions. And if I'm not mistaken, the entire office is female, which is also really awesome.<//review><userid>107747349126815834130<//userid>< Rating>

Professional, friendly, and they have adapted to keep the experience safe during these unprecedented times of Covid-19. I usually do not like going to the dentist and the operations of this office really lean into CARING for their patients and clients.< /text>

GREAT first visit! I was a bit nervous to see a dentist during the pandemic, but was pleased with all the safety precautions. EVERYONE was very kind and warm to me, which is such a novel feeling in a time that is so isolated. All my dental health was explained to me, and I felt like I could ask questions when I didn't understand. The hygienist also gave me some helpful flossing tips. Highly recommend you choose them as your dentists!</Review>

<Review>My wife and I have had many procedures done at The Smile Artists and we've never had a bad experience. We both had whitening done before our wedding (which looked great), fillings, and both deep and regular cleanings with many of the hygienists. Dr. Assudani fixed a tooth I chipped and the result is indistinguishable from the original.

My most recent procedure was wisdom teeth removal by Dr. Masood and it was about as close to enjoyable as having teeth removed is likely to get.

Finally, the patient experience is not complete without a great administrative experience and Jackie at the front desk is the best. She's helpful and friendly and even willing to help breakdown dental insurance choices when the time comes to enroll.

Their practices during the pandemic have been top-notch too- limited exposure to other patients, temperature checks, futuristic-looking helmet protection for their staff and new equipment in all the rooms to mitigate risks. Obviously dental work seems like one of the riskiest things to do during the pandemic but I felt comfortable and safe the entire time, and also important, I think their staff were just as well protected.

Overall The Smile Artists is the best dentist I've had and even though we moved from the area we'll keep returning in the future.< /Review>< pics>

If you're looking for the best dental experience you will ever find, look no further.  The Smile Artists are that and then some. Everything is top of the line , starting with the staff and provided services to the equipment and decor.  I woud describe The Smile Artists as a DENTAL LOUNGE rather than an office.<//Review>

Professionally, I’ve never had such a thorough cleaning/filling where I was explained every little detail along the way. Atmospherically, the office is spotless and has great music playing. Also free parking is so great. I want everyone to come here. You’re selling yourself short if you don’t.</Review>< pictures>

Brand new, clean, beautiful office, super friendly AND great looking staff. My first time here and I got my teeth cleaned today by Sam. From the moment you walk in you can definitely see how much has gone into the patient experience. I haven't had my teeth cleaned for years, and they didn't shame me! They were super nice about it in a way that I felt like I wanted to take better care of my teeth. If you're looking for a new dentist or to switch, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>The guilt that many of us share because of us share because of dental work melts away here.  This practice is like nothing I’ve ver experienced.  I don’t know if it’s because I’m new to LA or what but they are incredibly supportive and lovely.  Can’t feel needles, they are friendly, helpful and the views in the chair are amazing.  You can truly tell that the doctor wanted to do dentistry how she felt it needed to be done and she has succeeded massively.  I have never felt more comfortable and (unfortunately) have spent a lot of time in a dentist chair.  Truly a delight.  Get out of your head and go here.  You’ll never fear a dentist again.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2bbdf61275ab5:0x268620e13202d3ce<//GmapID></record>

<review>Excellent service! The staff is super friendly and the office itself is very upscale and luxurious. The doctor and team definitely are extremely passionate and have thought of every detail for their customers.
They were the first dentists I've had that really gave me explanations on every thing with my teeth and feel a lot more comfortable now!
Happy to keep going back and along more questions. Highly recommend!</review>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I am over joyed with my appointments! I’ve been to a lot of dentist’s offices in search of one to match me and my needs. And the smiles artists absolutely went above and beyond my expectations! Jackie was the first person I saw when I arrived to the office and she was so very warm and welcoming I was completely at ease. At a dental office may I remind you!

I had in office whitening and some cavities filled. Dr. A was very informative and she listened to all of my concerns and fixed ALL of them! I cannot stop smiling now! I’ve never been the one to be good with my oral hygiene, but because they cared so much and did such a great job with my smile, I cannot help but to be proud of their work and my smile 💗

Again, I am completely over joyed with my results and cannot stop smiling ✨< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Text>Even before walking into the office I loved the team. They proactively called, shared a personal connection (move to LA from NY), and confirmed my upcoming appointment. At the office, which is beautiful and well appointed with lots of natural light, the entire team was so friendly and helpful. I really appreciated the detailed walk throughs of everything they explained to me and their dedication to answering every one of my questions. They even printed out and reviewed (in a private "consultation" room) a list of potential treatments with detailed cost breakdowns of what my insurance would cover vs my out of pocket.

I've never had a better experience at a dentist and highly recommend them to anyone.<//Text></record>

<review>From the moment you walk in you are greeted with warm smiles and a gorgeous environment. From the coffee/drink bar to the amazing tunes coming from the speakers, my visit to this office was nothing short of AMAZING!!! This is the first time I was given so many USEFUL freebies!!!! You can definitely tell that Dr. Assudani and her entire team take pride in their work and the quality of care that they provide their patients. I think one of my favorite parts about going to the office is all the mirrors and the updated technology and I did not have to sell a kidney to get my treatment done, which is awesome especially for someone in school! I recently had to relocate to Texas and I miss Dr. Assudani, Sam and Kristal tremendously!!! I am still in search for a dentist and hygienist who provide the sane level of care. One thing I know for sure is that The Smile Artists are the Starbucks of Dentistry and every time I am in Culver City they can count on me coming in for my cleaning and any treatment!!!! Hands down I would recommend this dental office to anyone, and I still do when I have friends in California that ask me. Thank you just doesn’t seem like enough. :)</review>< Pictures>

The Smile Artists is the best dental experience I've ever had! I have been wanting to switch to a closer dentist and went in last week for x-rays and a cleaning. The office is amazing, they validate parking and Dr. Assudani and her hygienist Sam are both absolutely wonderful. I'm so glad to have found them - love supporting local businesses (and female owned to boot!). Look no further if you're looking for a new dentist!< /review>

The dentist was super friendly and very honest about which fixes would be solely for aesthetics and which for my health.  The hygienist, Sam, was very gentle while she worked. The whole family had a good visit.</Review>

<text>First, it was very nice to have a parking garage with plenty of available spots to choose from. Then, walking into the office you are immediately hit with a good vibe. It's not your typical dull white decorations of every other dentist office that I have used, instead, you walk into good music being played with colors on the wall and cool interior design.

The first thing you get to do when you sit down in your dental chair is to choose what you want to watch on Netflix on the TV that is right in view while leaning back.

Sam was my hygienist and she is awesome; very friendly and good at explaining everything she is going to do in your mouth. I need to get a crown replaced and Dr. Assudani was very thorough explaining all my options to get it done.

I am very happy to find a dentist/dental office where I will no longer dread going.< /text><gmapID>0x80c2bbdf61275ab5:0x268620e13202d3ce</gmapID>< rate>

<review>Yesterday, I came to this mall with my friends. We purchased something here for our friend's birthday in one of their well-known establishments. It was a fantastic place. Quite spacious and spacious. There was also a wide range of restaurants, coffee shops, boutiques, and playrooms. The cleaners are noticeable, too. Now and then, they keep the whole place sanitized. Nice management, guy.</review>< rating>

Good quality of products and foods. I will come back to this place for sure. It was a great place to buy anything you want. I got my new bags and shoes. Their crews were very helpful, accommodating, and welcoming throughout the shopping. A five-stars satisfaction rating all the way for this mall. Thumbs up!<//Review>

<review>There's a cool children's play area back by the ice skating rink. Quite honestly I wish when I was a kid they had them as neat not to date myself but instead of the soft foam padding they have on the newer playgrounds we had soft cinders to break our falls as a matter of fact I still have some in my knee, they weren't all that soft.

Even with covid restrictions I enjoyed myself, I was able to book my ticket online and was made to feel more than safe regarding distance from my other  moviegoers. Being my first movie in more than  a year I was impressed  with the concern  for our safety thank you AMC metreon</Text>

<text>I've been coming here 1-2x a week for about a year now. I freaking love it. The main reason I keep coming back is COREY, who teaches Cardio Carnival and Cardio Hip Hop classes. He is incredibly upbeat and fun, and he always emphasizes smiling and just feeling good. He's also a phenomenal dancer/bootie shaker. Any class with KARMA is fantastic too.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808580870d6d38fb:0x14d77dc217c71f12< /GmapID></record>

There are some five star components to the pier and some lesser ones. My kids loved that we saw a fight right in front of us while watching the seals. Decent free magic show as well but as with touristy places, the prices here are a bit high. We've been here over the years and it's about the same as it's been. - pretty consistent.< /Review>

<Text>Fun.  Drove here to pick up a friend and ended up needed a few things so decided to go to Target.  Surprised to find a Target with a much larger selection of anything we might need.  Especially the clothing department.  They've definitely upped their game in their clothing section.  They've got the cutest clothes now with a couple of up and coming brands that they've been featuring. Time easily flew by for this shopaholic here!;-)<//Text>< time>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>Westfield is a larger mall with many more businesses than the Metreon, but the Metreon movie theatre is San Francisco's best bet for flick fanfare but the big Target right around the corner has become the real main attraction here, in the Age of COVID. When it seemed like the American shopping experience was becoming an endangered species during the most desperate months of 2020, Target kept it's doors open. And thank heavens. Without them, the shopping and dining experience in downtown SF would have become monopolized by Walgreens. And that's not a world I want to live in. No offense, Walgreens. You definitely did your part on the front lines of the COVID War, but really, would you want to be related to consuming just the products on your shelves? Yeah, didn't think so! So yeah, Go Metreon!!!< /Text>< pics>

I had wanted to go for years. Finally got to visit San Fran on a work trip. One of the best experiences I've had in a movie theater. The seats are absolutely huge. Like recliners. The screen is giant and crisp. The sound quality is crystal clear and loud, possibly too loud. Heck even getting the tickets was easy thanks to their checkout machines. Everything was a cinch!</Review></record></dataset><record>

The mall has so many different stores (from affordable to high end shopping). They also have so many food spots and I'm pleasantly surprised by all the vegetarian/vegan options as well! I'm not vegetarian or vegan, but some of my friends are so it's nice to know that if they ever come with me to the mall, that there are food options that they can have if we want to stay in the mall for lunch.</text>

Top 3 things
1) Located just a short walk from Union Square.
2) Starbucks on the ground level, large Target on the first floor and IMAX.
3) Target was not too crowded and there were lots of checkouts open, so we were able to get in and out relatively quickly.</Review>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>The Metreon used to be an awesome place. Mostly due to the presence of the ONLY Playstation Store in United States. That one store made the entire mall a blast. Paired with an IMAX theater and adequate chain restaurants, it was hard to have a bad time there.

Nowadays, it is a husk of its former self - a painfully obvious reminder of the gentrification that plauges SF. Target, Chipotle, Starbucks and a cookie cutter food court leave much to be desired by anyone who remembers the days of rows of Playstations and countless hours spent playing there.

The Metreon is probably much better off financially with all of the stores and renovations that exist now, though I can't help but yearn for the good old times...<//Review>< pics>

Meeting someone to sell something off of offerup here that day. I didn't even go to Target, I just sold the item and went along with my day. Still crowded though, that corner is one of those notoriously crowded ones in the city.</review>

Easily the best theater I've been to in a while. Comfortable atmosphere and easily accessible with courteous staff. I went and the movie Cats with a friend and while the movie itself was a travesty of cinema, the theater itself was nice. They didn't have the heat up too high and the auditoriums have the new reclining armchairs.</Review>

Love this mall! Lots of stores and restaurants!!! Good variety of stores and places to eat. The food court is an awesome place to start. Eat then shop to walk it off. I do miss the fresh baked chocolate chips from Bristol Farms:(< /Review>

Shopping in the middle of a busy, congested city can be a pain, and there are a handful of other places to shop nearby, but the Metreon is the spot. Easy to swing into Target or grab a bite to eat on the move. Easily accessible and there is parking nearby thanks to the Moscone Center.< /Text>

<Review>The computers were down so our food was not DELIVERED correctly and was wrong. Then there was water in the cup holder I sat my cell phone 📱 in there thank God I caught it on time and I had to shake the phone and take it apart and hit the battery hole on napkins. Thank God it was not damaged. We had paid online for an AMAZING movie experience with leather recliner chaired the best sound and delivery of our food. I spoke to customer service they gave us a full refund of our $65.00 and that's why I have them 3 stars. Bad boys 3 was good.< /Review></record>

My fave park in the city for a long time is right outside the Metreon doors and has views of the old church and waterfalls with the city in the back and is truly beautiful. Inside best movie theater in SF with IMAX. Good food selection downstairs located both in and outside the building, but we usually eat across the street at Tropisueno(great Mexican food and drinks)! Also there is a small Target here for random stuff, the entire building in and out is fairly clean, and overall I just like this place. Walk here but driving will cost ya. Mission st parking across the street is your safest and  easiest place to find parking. Go see a movie in IMAX and have a great experience!<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcjqKHO2Tg8lSCmZRQgY45z3WGrcsukUg00wdH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

<review>The seats are soooo comfortable even though it doesn't feel like you're going to a movie theater because of the way it's positioned in the mall. Definitely easy access if you don't want to drive and pay for parking, Bart is a block or two away, and other means of public transportation is available and close.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Matreon will always be great. There used to be "where wild things are" and arcades on top floor, roof top/balcony restaurant, Sony store or ground floor and Discovery store where the target is now.
This was a great place when I was 19, it's a great place today and it will be better when my son will be going to the movies here in 2040<//review>

Great food and shops here, but the accessibility is a nightmare.  Some parts are comically frustrating to navigate with a stroller, I can't imagine the special hell it is for folks in a wheelchair...like the automatic door located conveniently at the bottom of the stairs.<//text>

Went here to watch Star Wars in Dolby... so awesome!  I love the Metreon theater for the amenities and the seats are so comfortable.

I also like the various food outlets at the Metreon. I've tried Inay's Kitchen and it's pretty decent Filipino food. My husband and I tried Cafe-X just to see how the robot operates and makes coffee. It was pretty cool and the coffee came out pretty good.  It's a bit pricey, equivalent to a venti SB drink but the actual size is like an SB grande.</review>

<review>Besides an AMC IMAX theater, there is a Target, a food court, a couple of actual restaurants, a billiard hall, and the adjoining semi-enclosed Yerba Buena Gardens provide epic scenery for walking, picnicking, or just people-watching. It can't really be seen from the street but you would not believe how much stuff is in that little park!

I only went to Target. They had in stock what I went in looking for, the electronics guy was extremely busy and running around like crazy. But, he kept it together and was knowledgeable, very helpful and my experience was pleasant. There first person i asked for help was extremely rude however.</text>

<text>Not a great visit. I went to see a show to start at 1030p tonight. I arrived at 1018p...when I walked into the theater I found it completely trashed. I had to walk all the way back to the customer service booth to find someone with a radio and showed her the images and video I took and she did call for cleaners but they came at 1030p when the show was supposed to begin. They didnt start the previews until the two cleaners finished tidying up the place. So our 1030p show didnt start until 1140-something. I guess they are short staffed so if you need a job with access to movies and concession food minimum wage is $15 an hour! Good luck with your job application!!</text><Rating>2</Rating></record></dataset><record>

It's a very clean, and nicely designed food court with a 16 screen theater and a Target. Also there is a nice park like area on the side that connects to the Yerba Bueno Art Center and a fountain with a waterfall that houses a small civil rights monument. On a nice day there will be dozens of people lounging and enjoying the area.< /Text>

It's not a bad place, but the movie theater is needing an update at this point, outside of that, there's just not much going on here anymore like there used to be. The food court is nice, but without other things to go to besides the movies or Target, I'd have to recommend going elsewhere if those three things aren't on your list.</text>

<text>Love to eat inside at their food court. We always have the chicken noodle soup at the soup place. Best soup ever. We have also gone to the movies here. Great theater. Plus Target is also in this building. Oh, and a Starbucks. Plus where we go to church is just across the street. Very convenient.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Movies here are always fun with the whole family. We just saw Star Wars and it was really cool. The fully reclining seats are amazing and give you a whole new view of the movie. I'm giving it 4 stars mainly because sometimes the bathroom lines are long< /text>

<Text>Well this place really hasn't changed much in years. It's mostly one big food court and a pretty big theater.
Very little as far a retail stores except for the humongous Target on one end.<//Text>< date>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>For an AMC with the big comfortable chairs and reserved seating, pretty good. They can also deliver concessions foods straight to your seat. Good theater and good quality screens and sound. My one complaint is that in some of the theaters there is a barrier wall that's a little to tall especially for shorter people who might have to struggle to see over the wall.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Shopping in the middle of a busy, congested city can be a pain, and there are a handful of other places to shop nearby, but the Metreon is the spot. Easy to swing into Target or grab a bite to eat on the move. Easily accessible and there is parking nearby thanks to the Moscone Center.< /text>

<Review>A place yo shop for good foods and also to catch a movie if you have some spare time.  Theres also a nice space behind it called yerba Buena gardens.  If you exit the back and turn right you can head up the stairs for a nice view or even before the stairs turn left and sit maybe 20 feet or so and listen to the water fall that drowns out most of the city noise.< /Review>< date>

Went to see Pet Semetary (sic) once again, the theater is amazing. I love bass that shakes the seat. The movie so-so, but there is just something about movies, popcorn and chocolate covered raisins. The only thing that could have made this experience better would be chocolate covered almonds. A definite five stars for the Metreon. It is always clean, comfortable and relaxing. Plenty of room for when the person sitting next to you screams and spills their popcorn. Thanks again by the way. If you haven't seen a movie in a while, I highly recommend the Metreon.</review>

Metreon in SF always a staple when working at Moscone Center. Extremely convenient, up 2 flights of stairs from North Hall and you've got a pretty decent food court. Buckhorn Grill so yummy, Korean BBQ place also delish, Soup and salad place, and others that always seem to maintain pretty busy.</Text>

I enjoyed this shopping center in the busy downtown area. It has a nice selection of shops and eating places. The AMC movie theatres are first rate with large screens and good sound quality. We even were able to get reserve seats for our movie something novel and usually found only at sports games and theatres.</text>

What did versatile place! You can see a movie get a bite to eat, walk around the park, sit in the garden, and checking out the Martin Luther King tribute waterfall was really cool too.</text>

<review>Very clean. Remodeled, it has a bar that opens @3pm the staff is super friendly.  The only thing you can't escape from is loud people or stinky people Haha that's not the theater's fault. I always come here this is one of the best theaters in the city.</review>< user_id>

Still cool because of it's name but it ain't like it used to be any more and should just use a new name change now. Because of Target is there and that not much of a tourist attraction of a entertainment complex to hang and just shop there. Need new ideas clubs, food spots, events, police patrol, places to shop and hang out and a tech tourism attractions of cool innovation of new future entertainment complex.< /Review>

<Review>There is a CVS drug store inside . The pharmacists are very capable and respectful of their customers. Also it is much safer with less theft since SFPD patrols the Lobby area. I've been going here since the opening I think approximately 7 years ago. The store is generally well stocked and the checkout time has improved.  It's great to have a  store with a wide variety of products so close to the downtown area... There's also adequate parking in the Large multilevel parking across 4th st. Thank you<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Great theatre to go to. Having a memebership is also even better. Although, their security is subpar. I left a bike outside chained up and it got stolen. They obviously weren't any help - so don't expect too much from them. Sometimes the ticket people can be harsh and rude. Besides that, movies are great to watch here.<//Review><user_id>106152504903681937734</user_id><gmap_id>0x808580870d6d38fb:0x14d77dc217c71f12<//gmap_id><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

This is a great theater the downside is that clientele is a little rough which spoils the facilities and experiance for movie goers and resturant facilities. Great selection of asian foods at resturants on ground floor. Movie theater and food is also good. Events space is amazing. Location excellent near main shops in san francisco<//Text>

Excellent movie theatre.  Has 3d, light effects, surround sound that rivals a live performance. Is very comfortable and clean. Has inexpensive matinee pricing.  I prefer this theater over others actually.  The movie selection is not too varied however. Typically stick to a genre...i.e, only children's movies, only action and adventure, etc. Not a wide variety of movie genres at any given one time. That's my only complaint. 😊< /text>

I like Target and the Theatres.  Target is a reasonable cost shop for most things.  The theatre is one of two Theatres in the downtown neighborhood with popular distribution movies, the being Century theater at the Westfield Center. I am more of Art Film, independent film fan.</text>

Movie theater itself 5 stars. We loved the assigned seats and the stadium seating and Dolby sound. Restaurants in building yummy. The park in back beautiful. Movie food too expensive. Popcorn, pretzels, water was $40. Parking was close, but took an hour to get out of lot, then another half an hour trying to turn to get the freeway. San Francisco in the area looked dirty and fun down.< /review>

<Review>I went to the movie theater and the food court.  Both really awesome and unique experiences for those just visiting or new to the area. Boba tea to pad Thai or Korean bowls and soup in sourdough bread... Food is fun. The seats at the movies are the best.  Recliners and all.<//Review>< user_id>

Went to the Metreon for a showing of Thor. As usual, it was packed but definitely an enjoyable experience. Its gone through a lot of changes. I personally liked it better when they had the arcade upstairs, PlayStation store downstairs, and the whole building was sort of like a free interactive space. I used to spend hours there.</review>

< review>
Bad experience with pick up.  I trusted that all items were in my package. Wanted to let them help the next customer. When I went downstairs to sort my items I realized two items were missing.  When I went back to have them look for the otems, they wanted me to bring all if my bags upstairs before they went to the back to look. I trusted that the items were there, they didn't trust me they weren't.  They were in the back.  I don't know if it was a racial issue or what.  More of an inconvenience than a solution.  Behind the counter was very disorganized.  I couldn't work well in that chaos.  I will give them the benefit of the doubt, but one more incident with them, and I'll just pay more at other stores.</review>

The best movie theaters in town. The Dolby theater and the IMAX theaters are amazing. My only complaint is the location of the bathrooms, sometimes depends on which theater you are in,  you may need  to walk really far to get to the bathroom.<//Review>

<Text>I Saw The Incredibles 2 here, and my experience was great! I've been to a lot of movie theaters, but this movie theater is one of my favorite in the entire State of California. Not only does this movie theater Focus on keeping their place clean, but they also focus on having a clean attitude. They were super nice giving us the tickets, and they made sure that there were no crying babies in the movie theater. Even if there was, which there was, they asked politely for them to exit the room while their baby is crying or they're talking on the phone.</Text>< Time>

< Review>
Had a great time here on a recent weekend away.  Grab your tickets early as it's quite common for movies here to sell out due to the recliner seating meaning that there are fewer seats than you expect in the theater.  The seats are very comfortable and the theater was clean and well run.  Plenty of places to grab a bite before or after the show, and the park right behind the Metreon is a great place to walk or just relax in the grass.<//Review>

Not what it used to be since they shrunk the theatre premises and rented out spaces to a lot of other businesses. It's lost its character and originality.</review>

<text>I always love coming here. The shops may change a bit but they are always a good variety, and the Sony store is a must for fans of the brand and good quality electronics and technology. Restaurants are good as well, with lush plant life and modern seating and relaxing spaces throughout.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808580870d6d38fb:0x14d77dc217c71f12<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This place has a good court but it shuts down fairly early. Considering there is a busy target and movie theater here, you’d imagine they would want to grab some of that business at night. Also, there is a serious homeless issue here that makes my friends and family feel unsafe, especially at night. The mall needs to add security around the perimeter and I. The gardens at night.</review>

<Review>Metreon is one of my favorite movie theatres! I always like coming here because they have a lot of movies to offer. Their food court is also bomb! I love their curly fries! The chair and theaters are extremely comfortable. I love the breeze in the room.

<review>I love this movie theater. It is nice, clean, plays all the popular movies, and you can choose a theater with extremely comfortable seats, space, and you choose your seat before you arrive. It has done some renovations so it has some additional theaters with even better screens and picture. My favorite part about this movie theater is its location. Within the same building are different food vendors (boba tea, Japanese food, Korean food, sandwiches, desserts) as well as a Target.<//review><gmap_id>0x808580870d6d38fb:0x14d77dc217c71f12< /gmap_id>< Pictures>

Great cinema! We went to see the latest Star Wars film here in IMAX 3D which was a fantastic viewing experience. Seats are comfortable and there’s plenty on offer at the concession stand. Well located and reachable by BART.</Text>

<Text>I'm just not a Mall person, but- the Metreon isn't "too much". The Target store still amazes me, it's huge and has good stuff at a decent price. I go there sometimes three times a month. There is a Starbucks and it has plenty of places to sit and people watch, also it's not as crowded as you might expect. I have only been to the movies here once. I'm a big movie person, and even though the theaters have stadium seating, great sound, (Very loud) and special events it's almost phrohibitively expensive. Especially if you are coming with your family. With admission, snacks, parking, and depending on how far you came, it adds up. Oh, there's a 3D theater, but I haven't been. So as far as I'm concerned, the Metreon is a good place to spend a day, and some money. 👍 Enjoy.<//Text><name>TRAVIS BREEN</name><user_id>104114442892016303973< /user_id></record>

Nice clean shopping center with a large food court, in the middle of downtown and walking distance to almost everything. Target has decent selection for its relatively small size, and the cinema has an upgraded screen with he private recliner seats that's really nice. Plenty of places to sit, plenty of choice of food, and nice lawn just outside. It's a nice place to hangout< /Text>

Cool spot in the heart of the city. Kind of like a mall but without shopping stores. Has affordable restaurants you would usually find in an upscale mall.

The only really good thing is the movie theater, other than that, there isn't really much here.<//Text>

Some of the best seats in San Francisco.

Very nice, open, assigned seating. Lots of room even when seat is laying back.

FULL wet bar!! Get a Jack and Coke.

I always wait in line to buy my ticket because the kiosk doesn't get medical insurance. Think about it.</text>

Only visited My China. Delicious food! Good service. Make sure to ask which foods are spicy if you are worried about that. I liked everything I tried.< /review>

<Review>I visited Target which is clean and always busy.

Staff are courteous and very helpful.

I had a return without the box which had never been used and was able to receive the refund with the receipt.

The location is always clean despite high traffic and there are always great sales and quality items for the most part.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808580870d6d38fb:0x14d77dc217c71f12< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Make sure you watch any action blockbusters here! The surround sound is great. There is not a huge amount of legroom, it's like sitting in economy on an airplane. Tickets for the latest releases sell fast. This is a popular cinema, as its in the heart of the city.</Text>

Had great time and staff was a huge part of that. We showed up 15 min after the very last show. They went out of their way to get us tickets bc the reg was already closed. Then the food was almost fully shut down and they gave us free popcorn on top of what we ordered. Thanks to the whole metreon staff last night you made our evening.<//Text>

Great theatres. Other than Target, and a modest food court, it's not much of a shopping mall anymore. The departure of the Playstation Store left a big void...< /text>

<Gmap_id>0x808580870d6d38fb:0x14d77dc217c71f12</Gmap_id><Review>The Metreon has been a landmark since Sony had it constructed.  It's not the greatest place, but it's also been keeping up with the times in most areas.  There's even a prototype or two for robotic food service within.  It's certainly not what you would expect from a typical Movie Theater/Mall.

That being said, it hasn't done much to enhance the movie experience, and in fact is currently in construction in ways that decrease that experience.  Let's hope they finish soon so the wonderful aesthetic can be reclaimed.< /Review>< Date>

<Text>It smells like raw sewage on the ground floor. Vagrants, heroin, and meth addicts on the sidewalk out front.

Functional shopping and entertainment center. Tiny food court on the ground floor, and AMC multiplex up top. Nice views from the panoramic windows.< /Text>< Pics>

Was mostly heading to Target and the ATM. We got most of what we wanted there. The accessibility to Yerba Buena park was a plus too. We met a very friendly lady manning the ice-cream store made the experience even better during Halloween.<//text>

<review>This places has changed so much. It's great on a sunny day. Grab some food in the food hall and then head outside for some sun and quick break from the 9-5. It has a Target around the corner and a Starbucks. However, this Starbucks is always packed. The crowd is definitely a bit questionable at some times. Homeless people do use the amenities during the day.</review>< UserId.>

< Review>
One of the nicer modern theaters in the city.  Prices are typically pricey, but they do accept Movie Pass which is a plus!  It’s not too far from Powell BART station and ... if you were a depraved human, there is a Target right next door where you could theoretically load up on snacks... but you would be stealing away profits from the movie theater.  Yes it would be wrong to buy a gallon sized bag of M&Ms for $5 when you could buy a tiny box of M&Ms at the movie theater for $15. So wrong!<//Review>

This is my theater of choice for watching movies in IMAX/3D. It dates back to when IMAX was a ginormous 70mm film reel in the lobby.

There's parking fairly close, and not much of a gauntlet of homeless on the way. One of my few reasons to venture into SF.</review>

Love, love, love this place!  We usually watch current movies in whIch the theater has the best comfortable and recliner seats, the place and restrooms are always clean and in working condition, the popcorn is always fresh, fountain area is easily assessible for refills, the food is always fresh, and the staff are always friendly and helpful. The only problem is trying to find street parking or paying too much for the garage parking. They should have discount rates for movie goers.< /text>

The line was so long to get the popcorn. Even though the lady that helped us was super sweet. It did take longer than expected. There were only 2 girls. Also, my husband went in line to get a beer, the bartender ignored him and helped someone else and spent like 5 mins just talking to the other guy, then turned to my husband and said the bar was closed. He was going to buy two beers and a glass of wine for me since this was our first time here and we wanted the experience. That seemed to bother him for the whole night. Not very nice.<//Text>

Went to the Metreon Tuesday night to see the free premiere of the movie KIN. This was a good movie. The theatre has very comfortable reclining seating and it was very clean. The prices at the consession stand is pricy. There are other food to go stands on the main floor. Also there's a Target in the building.< /Text>

Most notable for the AMC theaters with a 3-D iMax. Only Target store in downtown SF, which has a Target Open House section that displays the latest in tech gadgets for the home.</Review>

The Target Store located at this location has everything you'll need. From Holidays to Birthdays or Work to Home. Products are fashionable and good quality.<//text>

<Text>The theater has rats. Target runs out of food. The food in the food court doesn't seem appealing. The burger place is over priced. I go here all the time.< /Text>< pics>

The best IMax theater in the city. The movie complex is great, if you watch movies regularly, check AMC A-Stub. The only reason I don't give them  5 stars is the lack of indie movies in this movie complex.<//review>

A shadow of its former self now that the Sony Style and Playstation stores have closed. There is now a Target in its place. Movie theater is pretty good. They even have a bar.< /Text>

Great theater location, it's by an ice skating center, a Target, a Super Duper burger place and a ton of other restaurants.

By the way don't get your movie snacks here it's just way too overpriced like all other theaters in SF. Get snacks at a Walgreens then come back here for your movies.< /text>

<text>I absolutely despise this target is put a bad taste in my mouth for a Target as a store in general I've had two horrible incidents the first I was utilizing the companion bathroom with my husband he was taking a week-long injection medication and needed assistance from me at certain times of the day and we entered this companion restroom together as indicated while we were in there someone decided to complain that there's two people in the restroom a member of management and their loss prevention proceeded to open the door and Sheamus yelling and screaming about two people can't be in there were a couple there's no disability were in there having sex or doing drugs or bathing for all of the allegations they made they allege that we were stealing things they allege that we were improper it was humiliating as this was in front of a store full of people the second incident to occur was one so heartbreaking it's difficult to write about I was on target with my new puppy we'd had him one month and more attached to him greatly we adopted him from a family who had been left with this dog a friend of theirs abandoned the dog with them according to the family they already had two other dogs and couldn't care for a third puppy we adopted him and we're glad to do so he was amazing and he filled our hearts and our home well one day outside of Target actually I'm being nice Avenue not even your target a young lady comes up to me and compliments the puppy and then proceeds to try to take the puppy off of its harness I find out that this was the previous owner who now demands her puppy back she just had a newborn baby is homeless and is it abusive relationship she is sterically screams curses throws a fit in the middle of Van Ness my husband and I quickly Evacuate the area fast forward two weeks later we're in Target this young lady began screaming at the top of her lungs that I stole her dog police officer who is moonlighting as security at target takes my dog from me cause Animal Care and Control and decides that because she had right then and there in target created a lost puppy profile and because the dog had been previously microchipped under her name that she was within her rights to take the puppy home that police officer removed my dog from me illegally Target loss-prevention enabled him to do this I'm currently in the process of having an internal review completed on this officer and hoping to have a positive outcome this event was traumatic<//text>< pics>

The Metreon is a nice spot to stop in if you're visiting the Yerba Buena gardens and looking for a meal or passing nearby and want to sit for a bit. It's got plenty of great restaurants inside and cool gimmicks like the Cafe X coffee making robot, the hot ramen vending machine (it's legit!),   and the CVS vending machine.

The theater inside the Metreon is also fantastic. Super comfortable seats and great screens with awesome sound.<//Review>

Thai here is good. Bubble tea is popular. Don't eat the cupcakes or ice cream. Not very good. Super Duper has delicious garlic parmesan fries, donuts, ice cream and mini burgers.
Theatre has reclining lounge chairs.<//Text>

A vertical version of a suburban mall, but prettier.  A big cineplex that has decent screening rooms and an Imax.  A Target without a parking lot! Kudos for that.</text>

<Review>I love the Metreon. It has a true IMAX theater which is beautiful and such a cool experience. I usually come here for IMAX movies but have gone to a few others  recently with reserved seats and they have been very nice. Electric reclining seats that are set in pairs. Plus there is a wall between you and the each row. You don't have to worry about leg room or if the person in front of you goes on their phone. It's pretty nice and comfortable actually.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>My friend and I got absolutely lost trying to find the theatre itself. Sure they have giant signs outside the building but once you get in is where things get confusing. We preordered our tickets online and had difficulty navigating where to pick up our tickets and afterwards we couldn't find where the actual movie was being shown. I wish they had better signage for the directionally challenged like myself. They could also spread out their workers a little more to help facilitate the flow of people.<//Text>< Pictures>

It's 1947 and a loud boom awakens the residents of San Francisco at 315am.A metal ship from another world had plumetted into ours and smack dab into a shopping district. As people ran closer to see what the ruckus was, people could hear the piercing cry of a child. A child indeed was at the center of this crash, and yes the child was shrieking, but miraculously unhurt.
And it was here that Metreon was born and introduced to the world. Abonded by parents who realized his homeworld was going to end. Metreon was raised hy humble San Franciscans.The child was taised to be fair and righteous and grew stronger and realized he possessed abilities.
To honor the great Metreon, this mall was built upon the sacred land upon which the ship had landed. Come and enjoy a bowl of Metreon Soup or some yummy Metreon Mango Ice Cream!< /review>

The Metreon is a shadow of what it used to be, but the theaters are still cool. The theaters are State of the Art, and always have a first-run show. The complex nowadays has a Target (good sized for San Francisco) and a Starbucks. There is a parking structure across the street.</text>

<Text>Solid place to grab some fast food and see a movie.  Not a lot of shopping options here so calling it s mall seems odd but the theaters are great and the food options are totally on point.  Easy to recommend this place for a movie night.</Text><Time>1456020399925</Time>< user_name>

This is where you can find on the second floor one of the only two full-scale Targets in San Francisco. There is also the AMC Theatres on the third floor. There is one IMAX screen and 15 other standard/3D screens where you can see the latest films. There are also a multitude of great dining choices on the first floor including but not limited to Chipotle, Super Duper Burgers, Buckhorn Steakhouse, a thai restaurant, and several other great places to eat.</Text>

<Review>Futuristic shopping center in San Francisco, they have plenty of parking. The vibe is fancy. Plenty of restaurants to choose from, they have a food court. The beautiful Yerba Buena Gardens are in the back. It's pretty clean too. A good place to spend time in.<//Review>< pics>

Central location next to a beautiful park make this a great place to run errands or catch a movie. The start attractions here are the AMC movie theatre and the Target. There's a food court and a Target exhibit space as well.< /Review>

<Review>Ideally located in the heart of downtown San Francisco and minutes away from both bart and shopping venue...it is quite the gem. The bottom floor where the ticket kiosk are found...there is are an array of dining options to choose from especially for those that are hoping to skip the whole popcorn and sugar induced collar drinks. From Korean to Filipino to Thai and American...you have a decent choice option for a healthy meal. For those that need to get their fill of bubble drinks... you're in luck as they have one stationed directly across from the ticket kiosk. For anyone with children, cupcakes and ice cream can be found from the creamery shop. Just located next door you have even more options to choose from and the future ramen shop is set to schedule for opening any time soon. Alright let get to the good stuff. The metreon usually carries the newest movie release and not only that. They also have the biggest it not the second biggest IMAX screen in the bay area! The size of their competition are so generic that you have you taking for a ticket refund! For that that want even more immersive experience. They have a Dolby digital screen as well. It's comparable to the IMAX but the sounds pushed furthermore. What I do like about this place is that they also showcase international film as well.<//Review></record>

They always have free movie screening here, you have to sign up on different websites to get tickets. It's usually a long line for the best seats. But the theater is really nice and clean, it's always busy here but their show rooms are huge so you'll get a good seat.< /Text>

<Text>There really isn't a whole lot to do here but there are lovely restaurants, and the AMC theater with IMAX and stuff. I really enjoy the CafeX place where a robot makes your coffee.

You do get an excellent view at the Yerba Buena Park which in my opinion is by far the best part. Step outside and get fresh air, perhaps with an artisan robot crafted iced coffee.</Text>< Rating>

Great center to meet at; everyone knows it. Great for movies (IMAX, 3D), food court of all price tags, desserts, Target and, of course, 2 Starbucks shops. Being close to the Moscone convention buildings as well as the Marriott hotel, it's the first stop that attendees hit in spare time.</text>

Shouldn't be called a "mall." Good for Target, theaters, and food selection. In no way is it a mall in the traditional sense.< /text>

<text>Very awesome movie theatre, but extremely expensive to watch a regular movie. I will give them credit for always having a large selection of movies though.

Beautiful design of the interior and exterior, though I have gotten lost a few times navigating around the building.<//text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I've visited the Metreon many times over the years and watched it's tenants come and go. At times it has more restaurants or better stores (like when it had the Sony flagship store). And sometimes they experiment with things, like a farmers market at one point. Today it seems to have a modest balance. The main attractions here now are Target and the AMC movie theater.

I do like some of the places on the outside like Split and Chipotle. The access to the Yerba Buena Garden is also nice when the weather is good.</Review>

My friend's car was vandalized in the Metreon-servicing garage and this seems to be common. I don't feel super safe in the theatre here but screens are good. Some decent lite bites on ground level and adjoining restaurants for lots of choice.</text>

Definitely a good perk to live within walking distance to this place. Very convenient on a regular basis to be close to a high quality food court, movie theater, and shops surrounded by grassy spaces - hard to find in San Fran!  In addition, the new city target has made it so much easy to find groceries and alcohol at a reasonable price instead of spending a ton at convenience stores.  Check for events on top of the Metreon as well - they have large ballroom spaces at the top with outdoor balconies for nice views of the skyline!</Text>

I used to go here lots, but I think the combination of stores and food just doomed this place for me.

Putting the target in is a good idea though and hopefully it will revitalize the space.

I used to go here after Mac World for lunch, but the staff could never keep things clean enough.<//Text>

Lots of walking.  The IMAX and Dolby Cinema theatres are state of the art and comfortable.  It has concession stands, but no service at the seats.  Reserved seating for at least the auditoiums above.  Bathroom cleanliness varied during a single showing.  Overall, good experience.  Also, there is a food court near the theatre entrance with Thai, Korean, Chinese, American, salad, and soup places< /Review>

For some reason, the energy of this Metreon is kinda trippy, but it is in an amazing location. Perhaps with the City Target there, the overall feel of the place will change for the better. And who doesn't like Target?! Movie theater there is pretty solid in terms of technology, but beware the loud mouths who don't understand basic courtesy. They don't have ushers checking out the theater like they used to....< /text>

The xd movie theaters are well worth the cushy seating and awesome surround sound display. This is one of the few places you can go to find arcade games, a park with running water, a giant Target, and a multitude of savory or sweet food options.</Review>

IMAX - awesome. Rest of theatre seating is bigger at the Van Ness location.

Parking. It's San Francisco.

Previews are done very well.

Location is excellent in regards to dining options, the Target Store, mall, and bus, BART, and light rail options.

Bathrooms are clean and plentiful - except for being located near the front only.</Text>

The only thing really left in the entire building is the movie theaters.  The rest is just filler so the place doesn't look like a ghost town.  As for the movie theater it's fine if you don't care about the movie being in focus, starting on time, house lights going down before the movie starts... I could go on and on.< /Review>

Considering what a nightmare San Francisco is the Metreon is actually a nice spot to get away. With a great park and open space and a bunch of little eating spots it is a nice  place to take a break from work for lunch.< /Review>

<Text>Overall, the Metreon is generally a pleasant place to go. Credit the adjacent Yerba Buena Gardens with is beautiful landscaping and calming waterfall.  The Metreon offers a variety of eats including a Buckhorn Grill and is anchored by a City Target and a Theater complex.  And, what would it be without a Starbucks.  Located on the corner of Mission street and 4th street, it's always humming with customers.  Of note is the paid public parking across 4th street which is highly recommended over the almost nonexistent parking.  It also has a ballroom available for special occasions which can be rented if available.  It's often booked so is best to call well in advance to get a reservation.  Just one block from there is the Westfield Shopping Center.  See my review for that as well.  In closing, is a pleasant, picturesque location in the middle of the city that's worth a stop for the travelers to our city.< /Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Review>This place has really turned itself around from a bankrupted place with no stores to a thriving center of entertainment and eateries. There's lots to eat here from the many stalls in the food court, to several sorry down restaurants, to even a ramen vending machine. Upstairs houses the large movie theater, which is assigned seating. The seat are very spacious and comfortable recliners. The movie snacks are so so, overpriced for what you get. Target is located inside for some shopping as well. Located in a prime area surrounded by many restaurants and various venues.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>Loads of stores. Super busy with a lot of people during office hours. The theater is really good but the service isn't great at all. The theater is open till late and the butter popcorn is great. If you're leaving late from the theater, there is only one exit open so let the uber know exactly where you are. Also if you're walking just be alert, loads of shifty characters around.</text><rate>5</rate></record>

Went to Target and expected it to be better than what we had in Canada because it's a bigger market.   Very disappointed.  Their selection of kids clothing was terrible and their your selection was average with prices that are roughly equivalent to Canadian prices.< /Text>

More of a glorified and slightly upscale food court plus AMC movie theater than a shopping mall. Solid place to grab lunch and then eat outside on the Yerba Buena lawn. Free wifi so maybe a decent place to do a bit of work too.</Review>

Great place to go see movies, do some shopping, and have lunch out back at Yerba Buena Gardens.
There's a huge Target and many restaurants both inside and out.  There's a couple of places to eat out back both above and below the waterfall.< /review>

It used to be a nice entertainment center. Now it's only for movies and restaurants. But it's in an ideal location; a couple of blocks from Powell Station, Yerba Buena Garden is behind the building, and it's neighbor of the Jewish Museum and SFMOMA.< /Review>

Since they've completely remodeled the ground floor this has become a very nice place to hang out. There's a good food court, fun video arcade, a 16 screen AMC, and target on the corner.

Great place to catch a movie and some quick and decent food.</review>

< Review>
The theaters are perfectly fine, great place to watch a movie. The whole place, however: Not as good as it used to be. Gone are the attractions and interesting shops. Most of the building is empty, especially the retail space. Again, the only good thing about Metreon now is the theaters and a few restaurants. Aside from that: Don't really bother with it.</Review>

Actually I went to Target but I have had only good experiences at the Metreon. And if you want a shade TREE and grass, just go through to the east exit, and you will be at the Yurba Buena. And that's a whole other thing.
My only problem with the Metreon is the movie theaters.  I know things are expensive now but, if it's a family outing to the movies it can get really expensive.
Otherwise 🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅</review>

70 mm IMAX is a treat for the eyes. Amazing sound quality and visual appeal. Try to get seats in the middle section of the theater< /text>

Largest multiplex in SF with the largest and best IMAX theater. Conveniently located a block from BART and MUNI stations, plus there is a large parking structure across the street.</Text>

< Review>
Multiplex theaters with big, comfy reclining seats. Kiosks for ticket purchases (including MoviePass) are much faster than waiting in line at the ticket window. There's often a long line to enter the theater area - they need more ticket-takers. For a fun treat, get some coffee or tea from the CafeX robot on the Metreon ground floor. There's also an automatic ramen machine. The ramen isn't bad, but a bit overpriced for what it is.<//Review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><text>Poor Metreon! You used to be such a upscale mall in the center of downtown San Francisco. Now you're reduced to a giant Target and a giant movie theater.  Seems like things may be on the upswing though with some of the newer restaurants that are popping up in there.< /text>< pictures>

I have Moviepass, the AMC Theater here is nice and matinees are usually pretty empty.  Target is in the building and the cheapest place downtown for quarts of Powerade.   The first floor also has restaurants and an espresso robot that is entertaining to watch at least once.< /text>

The Metreon center, among other businesses, has movie theaters and a food court.  My most recent experience was in the Metreon AMC theaters which are quite excellent and technologically always seem among the best in the city.< /Review>

The Metreon is a mere shadow of its former glory. When Sony owned it, it was the place to go to find something new and futuristic. Only thing left of that is the IMAX which is amazing. The robotic cafe is also interesting.

Unless you are a yuppie, find a different place to shop. Yerba buena gardens is really nice though, but security might mess with you depending on your tax bracket.</Review>

I visited for the Craft Liquor Convention and had an amazing time. The only advise I would try to pass along is for more signs that clearly indicate any events that happen to be going on and to make sure that all the staff is able to direct attendees to the correct place.<//Text>

The theatre still has the best IMAX in the city. The remodel from a couple years ago has paid off and they now have some decent places to eat and a city taget. Nice to have the large park next door.</Text>

The star of this mall is really the AMC theater which spans many floors but I've visited to partake in ice cream from Cako (amazing, see that review) as well as for a private event on the rooftop space. It's a great space and the catered food is delicious.<//Text>

The luxorious seating in the theatre really spoils you, but far fewer seats mean it's tough to find good seating. Got placed in first row both times, which ruined the movie.<//Review>

Inside of the theatre are huge high definition screen and very comfortable viewing recliners and the sound system is amazing!! Not to forget to mention the snacks and popcorn! You can add all of the buttery topping you want to it at the condiments area! The Metreon also has great views of Yerba Buena Park and the concrete waterfall. It's an overall fantastic "out to the movies" experience.< /Text><gmapID>0x808580870d6d38fb:0x14d77dc217c71f12< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The mall has a few big names that are solid (target, starbucks, chipotle, the movie theater, super duper burgers) but theyre all things that you can find elsewhere and would come for even if it weren't in this mall.
The mall besides the things i listed, dont offer too many other things. Their food court is widespread and doesnt surprise anyone with the food quality, and you always see restaurants going out of business and coming back in.
But this mall also had the robot coffee (cafex) for novelty, offers free wifi, connected to yerba buena park, and is maintained very well! Not really a shopping mall as much as a place you can hang out.<//review>

Target Yes. Metreon AMC theater has a great staff, and I'm a fan of their Stubs Rewards, but the actual theater now has fewer films and while the seats are luxury, they seat fewer people and feel more cramped. Using the restroom during a movie when everyone has their seats up is such a mood killer.</text>

<time>1526081367607</time><rating>4< /rating><Review>I used to visit almost daily when the the worlds 1st and ONLY PlayStation store was located on 4th and Mission st. Corner store of the Metreon. You can imagine with 20 consoles os the best  and latest hardware and software.... games of course.... each console had a 20 in. Flat panel display and every console had a different game you could test ....no pressure to buy. It was a gamers dream....and then of course other patrons started misusing the courtesy and time limits were put in place. And i don't mean you only got to play to a certain lvl....no there was an actual sales person hitting the reset button just around the moment you were just getting used to the brand new 6 axis controller.... frustrating! No more so than PlayStations' frustration by becoming the neighborhood free arcade! But included within the store was everything else Sony. Home theater surround sound....computers...gadget heaven!
Metreon now.... is still a great place to visit with the theaters....restaurants... target store. It can still be considered a one stop entertainment plaza. Its centrally located to a merry go round, the zeum which is an interactive museum, bowling, ice skating.... not to mention CONVENTION HALLS EAST SOUTH NORTH you name it, Metreon is near it!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<review>Caveat, it depends what you're looking for. That said if you're looking for a spot to get lunch and enjoy it in a pretty nice park (Yerba Buena gardens). It is a good spot for that. Reasonably priced food and decent variety. However it is by no means the best food in the city.
There is also a target there, it is normal, and an AMC theater with nice reclining seats.</review>< username>

<Text>It seems like there are always loud obnoxious people in these theater.  If you complain they will give you vouchers to see another movie for free.

I go here primarly for the AMC theatre. Its a pretty good theatre - seats recline, they have closed captioning boxes for people who are hard of hearing, the staff is responsive to concerns about cleanliness. Definitely higher quality than their other AMC on Van Ness that I also go to.</review>

Nice movie selection and decent restaurants. Like the pinball machines at the AMC. Food court is good, but not as many options as the Westfield.< /review>

The supposedly cool, hip main anchor store is a Target - ZZZZZZ. Seriously? That's the best they could do?  The IMAX/AMC does have some nice theaters provided you wait a week or 2 to see the hot new film and go during the week so you aren't waiting in a damn millennial refugee line for everything. Avoid  this place on the weekends at all cost.</Text><gmap_id>0x808580870d6d38fb:0x14d77dc217c71f12< /gmap_id><Response>None</Response>< Pictures>

We only went to a restaurant, Split, on the Metreon. Had a chicken sandwich and it was okay, average at best. I used the restroom and two  "transients" came in to clean up. All in all, just okay. Saw homeless people rummaging through the trash can in front of the restaurant and saw some picking up cigarette butts and lighting them.< /text>

The Metreon is a ULTRA MODERN shoping complex with the Yerba Buena Garden Waterfalls & Park just outside on the inner side...and the convince of one stop shopping & entertainment within!
The City Target is the most reasonable food store in San Francisco...along with all the rest Target offers at incredibly LOW prices!
The Metreon Theaters have the IMAX option for many of the newest & latest show offerings.
The Restraunts & Boutique eateries offer all types of fare for nearly evert taste.
You can buy socks, meet your date, catch the latest film, and stroll the park afterward.
Its a MUST SEE when in San Francisco!< /text>

I think the new facilities look great and they are full of nice restaurants are options for everyone from pizza to burgers or any of the kind. It also seems like the security in the building has improved.<//text>

One of the only decent food-court options near the Moscone Center to grab something to eat at any time. It offers different restaurants with a variety of food options.</review>

<review>The fries were great but the sandwich? The bread was borderline stale - hard and unappealing. Awkward counter service then a long wait to receive our meal. Overpriced for what we got. Trying to fill the gap between boutique lunch spot and fast food joint, currently failing at both.< /review><date>1496204331811<//date><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< username>

The only theatres to have an Imax in SF that I know of. Its fairly clean, and has a food court inside. You get discounts on some of the food courts if you have your same day movie ticket in-hand. Imax prices are really $$, $21 now for general ticket! You can get a cheaper one by going to IMAX on matinee.<//review>

Shopping center with a movie theatre, variety of food options, boba tea spot, Target. Shares the Yerba Buena Gardens with YBCA. It's a nice spot to chill in the warmer months.</Review>

Other cool features include Target with Open House section for smart appliances and assorted eateries and restaurants.  It is next to SF MOMA, Yerba Buena Gardens, and Westfield Shopping Centre.< /Review>< resp>

Nice seats that power recline, plenty of arm room, I saw IT recently and had to sit up front and that wasn't even terrible. Look I'm 39, look like I'm 30 and still see myself as a young adult. But I guess things have changed. I asked for candy popcorn and asked if they had root beer. I was told by a snot nose, pimply face, I know it all who was no older than 15 grab ur own candy and go look if there's any root beer left. Look I know all about the self serve soda dispensers but I was late and didn't see them. I didn't know I could just grab what I wanted and after paying my $25 for it, the food I mean, 2 adults 1 child to see it = $50, I figured it out. I know as a kid I didn't trust anyone over 30 and I'm sure I had an attitude when puberty kicked in. But I was respectful. I opened doors for family as well as strangers, I still help seniors across the street and with their groceries, asking permission of course. I still don't think I measure up to my father, or him his. Where has the respect for others and yourself gone? Yes sometimes we snuck out to party or listened to what was rap at the time, I have no idea what it is today, but if this generational gap continues to widen, without the respect for the previous ones, we are in for a  wide awakening that scares the *!#$ out of me. People stop trying to gather wealth and step on and hurt the next man. If it's within your power,please show compassion and help the person next to you. If we all gave we would all recieve. Omg I just rambled for idk how long. I am so sorry. Ok, nice place to rest with a few issues. Sorry again.< /Text>

<Review>The shops at the metreon, along with a beautiful park right outside it's doors makes the Metreon a nice place to be at. However, they don't have any power outlets in their dinning area, and they have a awkward closing time (main lobby classes so they don't let you sit but AMC and Sharetea is still open, let the people sit!) I would definitely recommend getting something eat and taking it to the park lawn.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I love it, but they play movies for too long and don't get some of the biggest titles in...for a large central theatre, it could be better. I find myself driving to emeryville theatres every once in a while to catch something the metreon isn't playing.

The experience itself is wonderful though, especially movies seen in the IMAX theatre, fantastic!<//Text>

Buckhorn and Sorabol are delicious. The AMC Theater here is my favorite. Especially now that they have a full bar! The entire theater was just renovated, super comfortable This also the only true IMAX in the city. Don't go to the Van Ness IMAX, total ripoff.... The ticket price is the same but the screen is barely larger than a regular Theater. Seats are old and worn out etc etc.</review>

Now it's an even more half ass mall with more random down market crap stores and another depressing food court, a bunch of movie screens and a giant Target. Parking ain't cheap, so if you are looking for a random suburban mall experience you'd be better off going to Daly City, Colma or some other depressing fog belt cemetery town south of the city. At least parking is free and easier.< /Text><Name>Patrick Au-Yeung<//Name><date>1464651701739</date>< resp>

For being in the heart of SOMA the Metering offers a Target that is a little more than convenient. The selection is not the same as larger Targets but is appreciated none the less. Movie cenema and places to eat make it worth while as well. Yerba Buena gardens are right next door. Never a bad choice though prices can hit you wallet in the end sometimes<//text>

First things first- don't bring your 🐕 dog unless they areca service animal.
DO NOT BRING CARTS AKA.WHEELED CONVEYANCE. YOU WILL BE FORCED TO LEAVE THE GROUNDS IF YOU DO!!
I AM CONFUSED AS TO WHY BABY STROLLERS ARE ALLOWED- THEY ARE ALSO WHEELED CONVEYANCES THAT WEIGH WAY MORE THAN A LITTLE WIRE "GRANNY SHOPPING CART" DOES.
THAT RULE SMACKS OF DISCRIMMINATION AS IT'S NOT POSTED ANYWHERE ON PROPERTY- JUST ONLINE.
Yerba Buena gardens is peaceful place to relax in the 🌞 on the grass. The waterfall feature adds the relaxing rush of falling water to the ambiance.
Unfortunately it isn't "🐕 friendly" unless u have a service/companion animal.
Above the waterfall there is a reflecting pool with views of Old First ⛪, the oldest Christian ⛪in San Francisco and the surrounding tall buildings. There is also a view of the Jewish Art Museum and it's courtyard. Seating above the waterfall is plentiful and ✌ful. A place to do art, reflect or just carry on A conversation in the sun.
There is another watery feature with seating in the East part of Yerba Buena gardens as you 🚶 toward the S.F.MOMA (Museum of Modern Art). The building looks like a remora. Thus i like this water feature with the bubbling eruptions like a water volcano would resemble.
I hope you like all the different things there are to discover in Yerba Buena gardens/Metreon. I didn't list EVERYTHING there is to discover, so keep your 👀 open and your head on a swivel, looking up, down, and all around you.
You will be surprised!
With 💘 from San Francisco's SOMA.<//text>

The top attraction at the Metreon is the IMAX-equipped AMC theater. There are also some decent eating options, but not as varied as the Westfield mall food court nearby.</Review>

Try to go see your movie in a Dolby Cinema theatre if you can. The experience rivals the Imax. Seats are super comphy padded recliners that shake during appropriate moments in the movie. Super fun. The sound system is quite amazing, better than Imax, IMHO, and the picture quality is better than HDR. A little expensive but not as much as Imax.  The Dolby one is worth every penny.<//text>

It's the largest IMAX screen in North America, and the second in the world. Not my favorite theater, but it's the place to go for a film where you want to go all out massive 3D IMAX.</review>

<review>Great place for a conference! I was here for the HTML5 conf and it was a good place to have a conference. The Meteron itself has lots of shopping, food, and a movie theater to keep you entertained while there. It is also right next to the Yerba Buena Gardens which is very nice. There is a lot to do close by so defiantly check it out if you are in the area.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Skip it. Ill shop at Target because, where else?, but movie theater is poor and over priced and that leaves the food court. Which is, a food court.
DO visit Yerba Buena park right next to it though. A gem of landscaping and a respite.</text>

AMC Metreon is my go-to place for movies, and the foodstuffs and Target and other stuff in the area are a nice touch. I've been to a bunch of the restaurants in the food court, most recently ShareTea (boba tea) and Moolicious (crepes), though I almost never come here solely for the food. Metreon is in a convenient location that's easy to get to from downtown by transit, car, walking, whatever. Plus, since its backyard is Yerba Buena, there are oftentimes festivals and other events going on.< /text>

Ah the old place of the dead sony failed mall project. I heard this used to be a giant tilt arcade.. i love arcades! too bad its gone. Now this expensive metreon is here that doesn't even play every movie! Usually you can just go across the street to the westfield theater and catch a movie you cant find here. Theres tons of new restaurants that opened in the same shopping center. But I think the 2 best things about this place is the opening of the chipotle and the chronicle books store. Movies here are expensive but then again they are expensive in general. Its nice to get a coffee and sit in the park outside.</Text>

La Boulange, SF Soup, Sanraku Japanese etc. etc. I notched it down on service only b/c I'm not yet accustomed to how the lines for the food work yet.

This place transformed from a Theater off Yerba Beuna to an amazing space for shopping, movies, food + much more.

Few years back, I wouldn't have noticed Metreon as some place I would visit occasionally but after renovations and upgrades, I see myself going here quite often. On the 1st floor you have got a ton of eating options from Chipotle, La Boulange, Starbucks (hey you get real food there now), a whole food court, Cako, Froyo, pretty much whatever you want. They also have a couple of stores off 4th street including an apparel shop, book store etc.

2nd Floor has got the Citys *only* Target store. The floors above are occupied by AMC including an IMAX theater (the only real IMAX in the city).

If you are looking for parking, there is none at Metreon but there is a parking lot right across the street called Mission Parking. Public transport is easily available within a couple of blocks and since this location is in Downtown, its difficult to miss.<//text>

<review>This is the official Shiftee co-work space.  Decent wi-fi, nice facilities, plenty of power, and a bevy of food options.  Even during lunch there are plenty of places to seat, and a ton of opportunities to network with other people working here.  At least a wash financially compared to other co-work spaces in SF, and here for that price you also get some great eats.

If you are a small team(1-3), this is totally a great deal.  Plus, you can always catch a movie at the great theatre upstairs after work.  The only things I would change:

- An option to pay some amount($10/mo?) for better Wi-Fi.
- An app or website to order food and have it brought to table(hate to have to leave computers, etc alone while getting food).

I have some very small concerns on what will happen to this atmosphere when the Target opens in 2013, but I believe the management company will be able to handle it.<//review>< pics>

<Text>The theater was so dirty that we thought people were saving their seats while they stepped out, turns out it was just trash that had been there for who knows how long.

<username>Toru Moriya< /username><date>1567310984330< /date><rating>5< /rating><Review>(Translated by Google) The familiar home center target (TARGET) is included in the double circle mark. Souvenir chocolate and sweets are definitely cheaper than duty free at the airport. Various credit cards can also be used, but this time I was able to use any card, so I paid in cash. There are also such things. By the way, the card was usable in Super Trejo (TRADER JOE ’S) and Drury Store Walgreen (WALGREENS), so it seems that there was no problem with the card. Also, although I did not see it, I was doing Totoro in the movie theater. I'm relieved to see Japanese things overseas.

二重丸マークでお馴染みのホームセンターのターゲット(TARGET)が入っています。お土産のチョコレートやお菓子は空港のデューティフリーより確実に安いです。各種クレジットカードも使えますが、今回は何故かどのカードも使えなったので、キャッシュで払いました。こういうこともあるんですね。ちなみにそのカードは、スーパーのトレジョ(TRADER JOE’S)やドラッストアのウォルグリーン(WALGREENS)では使えたので、カードに問題あった訳ではなさそうです。また、観た訳でないですが、併設の映画館ではとなりのトトロをやっていました。海外で日本のものを目にすると何故かホッとしますね。<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5IeycVN8drGBagX-2qJsQoFSZ1vixZUVV4dML=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Here, the security guards and cleansing guards in the halls and coffee shops are the most rude people. The instigators are the managers behind them. Regardless of the three urgency of others, they don’t borrow the toilets, and they don’t dare to pay them. It’s rare!
