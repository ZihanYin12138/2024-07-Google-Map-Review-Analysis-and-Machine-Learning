<Date>1616468585188<//Date><review>A blind date. Just me and this new-to-me restaurant.  It was really good. This was a first to get beans to eat with my chips.  I kept it old school; a two item combo. A large beef taquito and a cheese enchilada and it was great.  Good customer service.
I pass by here (Ripon) a lot and at times with the family so next time we may plan on this place for a stop.<//review>< pictures>

The beef was good, but I expected some more grilled veggies since it was called fajitas. I forgot to mention they have the most gorgeous glass panels between each booth.

Horrible service. There was barely anyone inside. We never got refills. I had to send my.food back twice for it to be correct. Sat for over an hour waiting for our food when there was only one other family dining as well. This is the second time this has happened here. Will not return.</Review>

Totally disappointed in Las Casuelas tonight. We have went there at least once a week for years! Tonight we ordered take out, when we got home, we noticed a meal was missing. When my husband called to ask if he could come back and pick it up they argued with him insisting it was in the bag. They also said to bring the food back to prove it! Are you kidding me????? Ridiculous! Needless to say we won’t be back after they were so rude and treated us that way.< /review>

Excellent food. I had the Thursday soup special camarones and it was outstanding. The service was phenomenal. There were at least four different people taking care of us at all times. Clarissa was our server and she's awesome but anytime she would have to go to the kitchen several other people would check on us. It's hard to find that kind of service anywhere so thank you.</text>

<text>Would rate it zero stars if I could. The place was near empty when I visited, was expecting good food for the wait but was disappointed when it came. I was really upset with the meat, paid 14 for meat that was like old and gross. Would have told the waitress but she only came and checked up on us twice. I really wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who wants fast service and good food. Would have definitely spoken up about my burrito but like I said she never came back.< /text></record>

<Text>Nice place for Mexican food. They are never overly busy, have fast service and good food. Love the bowl of bean dip they give you with their chips and salsa.

<review>The service was very attentive and professional. The server worked within the whole food plant based and helped me find a delicious meal without working too hard. They only had two types of legumes to choose from, black and dairy added refried.  They also don't have a spicier salsa but it was very flavorful.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Decent food served here. Service is OK.
Not much in this town to eat.  Good
place to get a snack after target shooting
across the street. Very quiet town.<//review>

Great decorations, horrible food.  All canned beans and rice (at least it taste so) and cheap quality meat.  I was invited here for a conference meeting and found the back room a great location for any multi-person gathering, but the food is not good tasting. Cheap quality food.<//text>

Absolutely not 1 customer seated,ordered 2 simple plates,took 40 minutes to be served. Food was bland with canned sauces,garlic shrimp was tough and over cooked..Very over priced for what you get..will not go back!< /Review>

Delicious as always, friendly servers who are happy to be of service, even with indecisive people :) The best mexican food restaurant in the area in my opinion; I am never afraid to try something new when the quality is this good. I love the Fajitas and the Garlic bowl, they are full of flavor!!!<//text>

Bones in the fiesta cascade grilled chicken breast. Cut the roof of my mouth! No water refill until we're ready to leave. Not very impressed with the Ripon location.< /text>

This has been a favorite spot for years. While I personally no longer live in Ripon, I still find my way back to eat here with my family. The staff are lovely and the food is tasty. I don't think I've ever been disappointed; I probably couldn't even count the number of times I've been here - it's too many to keep track of. The thing I probably most look forward to is the goodies brought to the table when you sit down: chips, refried beans, and salsa -- A+. The grilled chicken in or on anything is good - quesadilla, burrito, tacos revolcados, nachos, you name it. Super tasty. When I crave Mexican food, nothing does the trick like this place.< /Text>

No. 1... is that he and his staff are genuinely concerned about your health and if there's anything they can do to help you, if you're having any difficulties or experiencing any pain! The pre-appointment interview regarding your current health conditions is very thorough and helpful in preparing you for your appointment with Dr. Chen.
The entire staff will go out of their way to get you an answer, a prescription or lab order if needed...Typically within a couple hours.
As far as Dr. Chen, first and foremost, he has excellent communication skills, he's a good listener and gives you adequate time to ask questions or to explain his treatment plan. He's always been prepared to review and discuss the current lab & radiology test results and when he wants the next set of tests to be completed.
Thank You<//text>

Excellent care from the persons at this facility. Top notch cancer specialists, and very personable too!
Great Doctors and support personnel who take a real interest in each patient doing well, and never rush with a patient, addressing all concerns and questions I have ever put to them, making sure I understand those answers.< /text>

Dr. David Burtzo was amazing when he was with Pacific Shores, and Dr. Nishan Tchekmedyian picked up where Dr. Burtzo left off, keeping up with regular re-checks to ensure I stay in remission. PA-C Scott Thompson is an awesome member of the team as well, helping to stay on top of things.< /Review>

< Review>
I see Dr. Chen in the Irvine location.  The offices are clean and the nurses and medical assistant are very professional.  On the first visit, Dr. Chen explained to me what kind of blood disorder we were looking for.  And how we are going to treat it, if it is confirmed by the blood tests in the future.  Sometimes, I saw his  assistant, but they are all knowledgeable and answered my questions patiently.  I have total confidence in him and his team!<//Review>

<review>They are great. Having said this please know that they are very busy and regretfully they do not have a “traffic” manager so develop relationships to contact AND stay on top of your needs/questions to resolution.
Accolades to the staff. They work hard and more hours than you would be aware of. Not a single bad/poor attitude among them.< /review>< Pics>

Dr. Danny is more complete and attentive than 4 previous Hematologists. He wants to get to the root of the issue, not just treat you. I would highly recommend Dr. Danny Nguyen. 10++Stars
Also, the ladies up front are amazing. Veronica and Claudia are always extremely professional, efficient and pleasant. The office runs like a well oiled machine.
And the nurses are head and shoulders above the rest in their field. Maria and Anh are an unbeatable team. 100% satisfaction with our entire Pacific Shores Team! Thank you!< /Text>

Nishan Tchekmedyian, MD Is extremely knowledgeable in his field and up to date with most recent drugs.
He is compassionate and optimistic, breath of fresh air as opposed to most oncologist with no bedside manners.
His concern for quality versus quantity is most valuable to me.
I highly recommend him.</review>

The office didn't submit my husband's blood test paperwork to lab after we reminded them twice. This wastes people's time because most patients have to take time off to go to the lab. The office is poorly run. Unacceptable!< /text>

I’ve taken probably 8 flats to these guys over the last couple of years and each time they were able to accommodate late night walk ins. They make sure to get you out quickly and now they have new tires that are even cheaper than Walmart. It’s great to have a reliable place to go to when something happens.<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Ive been Getting great tires from here for many years now. They always have better prices and get you in and out quickly and efficiently. Great service! Ive got tires and wheels for my 66 Impala, fat rear tires for my 2018 Dodge Challenger RT Plus, and I will be going back again real soon for my pick up truck. I was already quoted a price that blew everyone else's away. Great tires and wheels to last you a very long time. Go and see or call and get a quote yourself. Lots of wheels to choose from oldschool to newschool, or can order them and be there same or next day.

Once again got hooked up with a great set of tires at a great price. I was in and out promptly, with excellent customer service. A Nice selection at afordable prices. Ill keep coming back and Ill keep revominding people. Thanks again for always taking care of my family and friends we appreciate your service.<//review>< pics>

If your ever in need of some tires new or used they also sale Rims. I highly recommend to visit West Coast Wheels and Tires. After a disappointing day of unfortunate damages. These guys where able to get me back on the road. GREAT GREAT customer service. I appreciate your honesty and  I am very grateful to stop at your shop.
I couldn't thank you enough  SAL.</Review>

DO NOT GO NEAR THIS PLACE.
I purchased tires ($1400) for my truck here. They installed them improperly (didn’t align them which is industry standard for switching to larger tires) and didn’t balance them correctly resulting in them shredding apart At 15,000 miles and causing damage to the under carriage of my truck. The owner stated he wasn’t responsible and does not align vehicles when installing new tires. He offered no other form of resolution other than selling me two new tires for $50 dollars above cost, and refused to install them (sketchy??). I reported them to Bureau of Automotive  Repair (BAR) and opened an investigation.<//text>

<Review>My boyfriend went to get some rims and tires on credit offered, but he was not explain the credit in details.  West Coast got their money right away and  he was left with a huge amount, that would have taken a very long time to pay if he was not on top of it. Be careful and watchful, because at the end you will end up paying more than what the merchandise is worth.  Very, Very bad experience with this place.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x8094678841763a1b:0xc3d1dbae73851970</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Wanted to charge me 340 for four new tires and my brother had called and already been quoted 280 at another place. So we were getting ready to leave and my brother showed him an ad from another place and said we were going to go elsewhere. The guy said he'll beat that price and charge us 260 for all four. So I appreciated that instead of letting us take business elsewhere. The wait wasn't long and payment was processed quickly.<//text><Resp>None<//Resp><name>Vanessa< /name>< userid>

I came in with a leaking tire. It was not repairable. They got a replacement at a reasonable price and replaced it in minutes. Impressive!<//text>

Great prices, and employees. Been a customer for about 3 years now and will continue to be one.  Just a suggestion, maybe clean up the waiting room. Chairs and walls are pretty dirty.  I know it’s a shop, but it’s where customers wait.< /text>

<text>2 times I've been there, and both times they were very quick and very friendly. Super cheap price, and they never pushed to upsell.

I bought a set of tires from them in December. I went into get a nail removed and they charged me $15 for the repair.  Not a good way to build customer loyalty. Any shop would have done it for less, even if I hadn't bought the full set of four tires from them.<//Review>

< Review>
They have good price.  I brought a truck in to for a suspension job, it required an alignment afterwards, the price we agreed on includes the alignment.  I got my truck back, the car drives weird, it felt like the alignment is off.  After a couple months i finally decided it need to be check again.  I took it in, all they did is switch the front tires around and gave the truck back to me.  After a few weeks, i took the car to another alignment shop.  I found out the alignment was way off.  It seems they never perform the alignment in the first place.  I dont think i will go back there again.   I dont trust them anymore.< /Review>

Called for tire, was told yes in stock 2 tires would be 130 when i got there price went up because 'taxes' I Have no problem paying But if i called and said im from 55min away and im Told 130 thats exactly what im expecting to pay ended up paying 145 and they supposedly balanced them but yet my car shakes now, i found a better place and closer same tires and everything for 125 and they actually mean the price they give you when you call to ask and actually balance. West coast lost my buisness just by not keeping there Word.
Go at your own risk they do keep alot of diff tire sizes in stock just they charge you what they feel like when they see you. They promise u a deal but end up adding more at the end.
also person who helped us (me and my bf) walked up to my car to tell me i needed to be more clear next time i call and i thought that was bs for the simple fact they are in business because of US the customer do not tell me what I need to do when you cant even keep your word.
i will be shur to let everyone i come by not to go there unless it is a absolute must!</text>

My whole expireance with this company has become a nightmare, maybe if you just wanna a simple fix on a flat or new tires, but when it comes to getting a lift for your truck it's No Bueno I don't wanna get into all the details but here I am almost 2 mths in and Between them ordering my lift kit, and installing it here I am waiting !! I just want to get my truck and I will never do business with them again !!! Unfortunately I have to give a star but they don't deserve any!!!  Next time I will pay a couple more hundred and have it ready within 1 day and not have them going around the bush trying to say how hard my truck is like SMH!!! It's not Rocket Sicence how  hard can it be !!!!</text>

I’ve been thinking about leaving my current cell phone service provider for a long time now, so I went into this Verizon location to look at their options and what they had to offer. Ms. Tatianna was so friendly and attentive and was able to answer all of my questions. :)< /Review>

<Review>I went into the store to pick up my iphone. The women Ana at the front counter was so rude. She chatged me to transfer information from my one iphone to the other but it couldn’t be done. She wouldn’t give me a refund even though the service wasn’t successful. I asked her to call management to give me a refund but she was just so rude. Ultimately my phone set up failed and I will loose all my photos and contacts on the phone now with apple so hopefully they can solve this.< /Review>< Rate>

The Verizon Clerk was very nice and helpful. I was there to pay my bill and was quick service. I think I’ll be going to this location then going all the way to North Park area. Thanks for being so helpful 😀<//Text>

I saw the notice on the door to check in through the qr code, which I did, but I was never texted back. I know there were 2 employees there, but I went around, and even ate a bit before I want back. I asked the employee who happened to be there how long I would have to wait, and he said I could just walk in, so I found the check in method a waste of time.
He helped me, and was very courteous, and though he helped me put the screen protector on, which cost $70 for the item, the screen protector created a bubble in the fingerprint spot, which I thought was okay, until I realized my phone could no longer read my fingerprint, so now that no longer works. And the wireless charging pad doesn't work, which I will have to return/ exchange when I get some free time.
So, although Alex was great with customer service, there were some things that didn't make my experience great.< /Text>

<review>I visited Sweetwater Victra for a new phone. I was guided and helped by Ceci and Patrick who were both very patient and knowledgeable. I’m super happy with my experience led by these two as well as my purchase and new plan they provided. I would highly recommend you visit them for your mobile needs!< /review><UserId.>115649485335674869575</UserId.><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Rating>

<review>First of all, I went into the store because I was having problems whit my phone. When I got to the clerk the service was really slow. Then when the clerk was helping me whit my issue, she just took off to do some scanning or inventory and just made me whait there whilst she had no rush whatsoever. After she told me that there was nothing she could do, her suggestion was to get another line so i had to pay doble or get another phone. And before I left I wanted to get a new case for the phone and, even though I didn't ask because of the frustration, she did not at any point mentioned how much the case was which would have made me think if I really needed it or not because it was pricey.<//review><Resp>{'time': 1594829199830, 'text': "Hello Jose - we apologize for your less than ideal experience at our National City store.

<Text>I ordered a phone two days ago and received a confirmation number. When I went to track it I showed it arrived today at 10:59am with the address of the Verizon on Sweetwater road National City. I called them to confirm and spoke to Erick he has said to call back in 10 mins so he can check the safe. Called back in a hour and he was clueless so then he asked me to call back again in 10 mins and I told him I waited a hour to call you back and you have no answer, he then was a smart@$$ and said then call us back in 10 mins not an hour. Then I called back end up talking to Kenny who was really unprofessional on the way he spoke to me and talking under his breathe when I asked him question. He was having a Side conversation with Erick talking about me while I was on the phone with him. Every time I asked a question he would say oh my gosh and cut me off when I was speaking just to tell me it’s not there. I asked him to not talk over me and he said oh my gosh and I told Kenny he was be disrespectful and he then told me your being disrespectful. He kept Arguing with me. I’ll be reaching out to Verizon and District Manager Yvonne Ying about my experience. DONT GO INTO THIS VERIZON THESE KIDS ARE RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL SAVE YOUR TIME BY GOING TO A REAL VERIZON STORE. I will never step foot in this store again!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< rate>

amazing service, all reps are amazing. They are very thorough and provided me with all the answers i needed to make my decisions for my verizon needs. They're not your typical sales man they actually take the time to understand our needs and recommend products and services based on our answers to his questions. very professional and great experience. the store  smells amazing and was very clean and appeared to be a well oiled machine. amazing experience!!!!!!< /review>

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!  DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE!  Working with KEVIN was the most terrible experience.  I was told that I was arguing with him when I was trying to communicate my request to hold an item.  He literally made it seem like I was arguing when I couldn’t even get in a word.  THEN HE HUNG UP ON ME!!!   He should not be working in customer service.....< /text>

Came in with my brother and 2 other friends
They had 2 people working ,and 1 person in the back
One person was helping a costumer and the other was helping us while on the phone. Which was frustrating as he was try to multitask when he couldn't .
My brother bought the google pixel 3xl
The sales representative tried to force us to get the pixel bundle which didn't even include original charger,case or screen protector from google. That bundle online retails for $89.99 usd
Once I told him about the bundle he turned us over to another rep and they ended up taking off the bundle ,
Be careful when you go here and make sure you ask questions
Super bad experience
They don't even offer legit brands for the cases or any  accessories.  They are all off brands .</Text>

This store should not be allowed to have the Verizon name. I came in to purchase a phone and talked with the employee who told me it would be 40 dollars to upgrade and when I agreed to it he suddenly said the new price was $200 out the door. When I asked why he told me it was taxes and fees. When I asked what he fees, he told me they add on setup fees and that he has to sell me at the very least a screen protector with the phone. He literally would not let me purchase a phone without buying accessories. I walked out and went somewhere else after that, make sure you shop around and ask questions to get what you need not what they want you to have.<//Review>

Had better experiences at Best Buy, Costco, and actual Verizon stores.  This is not a Verizon store, but a "premium" retailer.   Went here in May 2016 and was told a lot of false information by the store manager.  Had to call customer service and visit an actual Verizon store several times to get my return processed.  Ended up being a waste of time and money.<//Text>

<review>First of all I was going here to buy a phone and the rep said here we are offering a free pocket wifi. This is an extra $10 on the bill. Not free. Went to return my phone because it was overheating before the 14 days was up.The rep said I need to return it with Samsung because they have a 1 year warrantee. Witch was a false statement and I could returned the phone there within the 14 days. The rep that sold me the phone made a statement that I needed the pocket wifi to get my phone discounts. Witch is a false statement. I wasn't able to return anything even with a Verizon rep on the line asking them if they could make exception this time it's only one day. This is not a direct Verizon wireless store. I would stay for away from place full of lies and deceptions. Plus they will not work with you like the direct Verizon store can. Plus your paying extra sells tax because its in National city..

First time. Over the top service. As good as it gets.

I was traveling overseas and needed to obtain and submit a negative test-result certificate for COVID-19 at time of departure.

But the airlines required that I test 72-hours in advance of takeoff, for which lab results coincided with the weekend.  Nonetheless, doctors and staff went out of their way to sign, scan, and send me the negative lab results, during their time off.

I’m a senior executive for a hi-tech company and recognize well-run operations that uphold tenets of putting customers first; personal care, professional commitment, and good vibes abound here.

A heartfelt thanks to Dr Newman and his wife; and the entire staff.< /Review>

I had COVID-19 test in this facility in Dec 2020. COVID-19 testing was okay and I have no complain, but I do not recommend this facility if you are planning to submit your cost to the insurance.

The care facility refused to accept my insurance (BlueCross) even though the facility was listed in the insurance website. I didn't think twice because this place was near my home and I thought I can submit a claim and get reimbursed. It turns out a nightmare.

The facility initially did not provide a properly itemized receipt missing various informations required for an insurance claim (TAX ID, procedure code, and diagnostic code). I've called and asked for those information, but they answered no. I've submitted the claim and it was rejected due to missing information in Jan 2021.

I contacted the facility again and they provided another itemized receipt. This time they provided procedure code, but still lacks TAX ID and diagnostic code. I've asked again to the people at the desk but again rejected to provide those information. I've talked to an insurance claim officer and they says it will be rejected.

I understand this is a small facility and may not want to deal with insurance claims. But I do not understand why they do not cooperate nor not able to provide proper forms for an insurance claim. Why make the patient life harder? This is my neighborhood, and I don't think I will ever visit this place again.<//review>

I had a rough start with some questions regarding my Insurance Eligibility however the staff called the Insurance company directly and made sure all was correct and taken care of.  They were caring and efficient. The office is clean and the wait was short. Dr. Newman was kind, thorough and made me feel cared for. I would definitely recommend this Urgent Care.< /text>

<Review>Dr. Robert Newman and his staff at American Urgent Care are super professional and kind. During the covid outbreak they provide a super hygienic environment to attend to urgent medical conditions that is as hassle free and worry free as I could have ever imagined. I was so reluctant to go to the doctor but after my visit here I felt a lot better. They also can provide some prescriptions on site.  So it’s as much of a one stop shop for healthcare as our current system provides and really close to my house in Tarzana with lots of parking. I can only remember living in West Hollywood and going to Cedars and paying $35 for parking. Oy.  Never again. From now on only Dr. Newman in Tarzana.< /Review><name>Dory Benami</name><Rating>5<//Rating><gmap_id>0x80c2990dfbfbd2b5:0x624dbd81aad3ab2b<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Dr Newman and his team of professionals provide excellent diagnosis and patient care. Went in for breathing issues, was immediately diagnosed and treated for my condition. Went back for followup and received additional analysis and treatment so the condition will not occur again. Highly recommend Dr. Newman and the team at American Urgent Care Center!< /text>

<Review>Dr. Newman and his staff are the best that you will ever find for exceptional medical care.  I can't believe that in this day of insurance companies and the medical community trying to maximize their profits, with minimal care, there is still a doctor out there that takes the time with his patients and gives phenomenal medical care.  American Urgent Care Center is modern, a one stop center with everything you need for excellent medical care and has a staff that is compassionate and cares.   I would choose this facility over any urgent care center, or even your primary care doctor in Southern California.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<review>This is the very best urgent care experience I have ever had. The facility is very modern, clean and state of the art. I was treated quickly and felt the quality of care was exceptional. Dr. Newman took his time and didn't rush to the next patient. I felt like he listened and genuinely cared about my well being. I would recommend my friends and family to come here. I drove out of my way to come here and it was worth it. Dr. Newman and his team are incredible!< /review>< pictures>

First let me say, there's not a cleaner, nicer, more modern urgent care or doctor's office in the greater LA or Valley area. Even more importantly Dr. Newman is incredibly caring, kind, compassionate and unlike most urgent cares (or even doctor offices for that matter...) he really takes the time to diagnose you, and make sure the treatment you're on is right for you. He won't rush you in and out of the office and is willing to take the extra effort to figure out what's going on with you and how to fix it.  He is also incredibly funny and keeps you laughing the whole visit. He's truly unlike any other Doctor I have had the pleasure of seeing.

This also goes for the staff. They are all very polite, knowledgeable and efficient.

This is not our first visit to American Urgent Care. I came down with Vertigo after a trip to Mexico. I had been to two urgent cares in Los Angeles and the ER at Cedars Sanai. No one was able to correctly diagnose or treat my Vertigo. But after one visit to Dr. Newman he got me on the right meds and also was able to get my insurance to approve an MRI which no one else had been able to.

My wife just came down with a bad persistent fever and cough so I knew there was only once place to go! He saw her twice and diagnosed her acute Pneumonia via a chest X-ray and we are both super happy to know we can count on the exemplary care of Dr. Robert and the staff at American Urgent Care Center. They are the best!</review>

< review>
A very friendly staff, an excellent doctor to boot, who genuinely makes it his passion to check on your vitals, and determine the root cause of your illnesses. He used the analogy for medicine that "You wouldn't paint an 100 year old building to make it look beautiful, without first checking the foundations.", and boy does he apply this philosophy to the fullest extent. The prices for his medicines are quite acceptable, depending on your financial position. As someone whose in between medical insurance providers right now, this really helps me immensely. Dr. Robert Newman, I really need to thank you for your help with me!!!</review>

<review>I had been on the market to upgrade my HVAC for sometime but couldn't seemed to find a company that seemed trustworthy and with reasonable prices. I was browsing through Yelp and came across Acosta I called spoke to Yvette she was very knowledgeable and kind she was able to have someone come and look at my system the same day! I then met Danny he was so awesome well dressed and professional I express to him my concerns and my budget he then proceeded to show me my options he made sure I was aware of the system I was getting. He stayed within my budget and I was sold! My system was installed with in a week the crew was so professional and clean will definitely recommend to everyone! Thank you Acosta!<//review>< pictures>

Had a issue whereas my compressor wouldn't go on. Called Acosta and they sent out a technician, who found the problem and fixed it. They are great for that and I would recommend them to anybody. The owner (Jessie) actually came to my house one time and fixed a issue at no cost.
I offered to pay him and he said it was free, "because we want our customers to be safe."< /text>

Acosta HVAC was recommended to me by several friends whose families are in the construction business. Jesse gave me a very fair and honest estimate, no shady shortcuts or scare tactics to inflate the cost (yeah, other companies tried that). I talked to assorted other HVAC companies for quotes and I am glad I chose Acosta.The crew from Acosta was very competent and efficient with the installation of the new furnace, AC, and replacement vents. Getting the work done by Acosta was a very satisfying and positive experience, THANK YOU Acosta HVAC!< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>The Acosta team are thorough and easy to work with. I have seen some reviews on here complaining about price. I'm absolutely positive you could probably find somebody to say that they can do anything that Acosta for less money.  And sure, somebody else will probably have a brand new air conditioning unit placed inside of your home. The one thing that you will not be able to get from anyone else is the quality.

Buying the system is only a very small portion of the installation process. The quality and attention to detail of the Acosta team is the best I have ever seen.

To put it in simple terms, it's like if you bought a car with a perfectly running engine but the doors are falling off and the radio doesn't work. You would naturally say that the car is a lemon. The same thing is true with an HVAC system. Just because the furnace and air conditioner function fully doesn't mean the system functions. Jesse and the Acosta team will make sure that you have an entire system that works as well as it possibly could.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<review>I needed a complete new system to replace a 25 year old system that had asbestos in the ducts
Ramon was the senior technician that came out for a service call and checked everything Acosta even hired the remediation company to remove the asbestos ducts
The crew that came to my home worked so well together it was a pleasure to see and they were respectful of our home
The crew Ramon, Daniel, Umberto, and Luis all were top notch and did a perfect job
I will always recommend them!<//review>< pics>

<Text>Ahhhmazing! Jesse was to the rescue in hours! Acosta Heating and Air Conditioning not only provides a prompt response; their customer service is amazing from the start, and it does not end once they leave. They follow up and check-in on job satisfaction. Not to mention, everyone you deal with from the phone to the technician/electrician who comes to the house has a pleasant and serving attitude. I HIGHLY recommend you try Acosta Heating and Air Conditioning for any of your heating and cooling needs..you'll get both excellent work and service!!<//Text>< username>

<Text>Very misleading we were quoted $75 to perform a check-up the AC unit prior to the approaching summer. The priced doubled evidently AC/Heater are two separate charges totaling $152. The technician hooked up gauges to AC unit in my absence before I had arrived. I am the home owner and this is my rental property. He indicated to my renters that the freon was low and the AC needed $240 of freon. He told my renter that it would be an additional $95 if he had to come back and I needed to make a decision. I was in route from Los Angels only 10 mins away. This company was servicing my other neighbors' home as well so why couldn't he wait? When I arrived I asked him if there was possibly a leak thinking how did my relatively new AC unit lose freon? He advised me that he was not qualified to find a leak he just wanted to install $240 of freon. My AC unit is only 5 years old it has been working great for 5 years now. This very unprofessional technician said "well maybe the guy who installed your unit didn't put enough freon in to save on his install cost" Hum... well even if that was true it's VERY unprofessional to talk to customers like this. I lost my confidence in this company at that moment. My AC unit has a 10 year warranty if has a leak it should be covered. Also it's cooling the home without issues especially a couple of weeks ago during a heat wave. To sum it up I have yet to receive a final invoice with their report of findings listed so I can submit to the company that installed the unit. My stand-in handyman, other neighbor actually booked the appointment and got them started he too had his AC service (he lives down the street there was 3 of us all quoted the same $75 for a maintenance call) To add insult to injury this company went behind my back today and received payment from my handyman since he booked the appointment. Yesterday I emailed Mr. Jesse Acosta myself included my contact info for the billing and expressed my dissatisfaction. My bill has been paid but I have yet to receive a final invoice with the report of findings.</Text>< pics>

I have lived in WoodRanch for over 25 years, and have used Jesse and his team at Acosta Heating and Air-conditioning the entire time.  He replaced my air-conditioning unit and continues to maintain my furnace, AC, and Water Heater.  Recently he installed several Fans in my bathroom, a dehumidifier, and my thermostat, all installed expertly.  Additionally, you will enjoy talking to not only a professional, but also a very nice person who will listen to your needs, offer you a very fair price, and install the necessary equipment.  Highly recommend you call Jesse and tell him I sent you!  Thank you.</review>

<text>Highly recommend Jesse and Acosta HVAC. Fairly priced, great service.  The personal touch Jesse provides is great.  He shows up at the inception of the job and checks in on the progress.  He set up a time to come by and made sure I understood everything s few days after installation.  The workers were great as well.  When they left the first day they left the house cleaner than when they got there.  They showed up on time and worked hard all day.  They were also super friendly.

Jesse Acosta and his crew did a wonderful job on installing new vents in the attic and putting in a new heater and air conditioner.  Jesse came up with ideas that the other companies that I interviewed never even thought of.   He came over several times to make sure the job was done well and even crawled up in the attic himself to make the final adjustments.  The price was good, and the house is nice and warm.</text>

I’ve recommended Jesse to three of my neighbors and they all installed Trane heating and air conditioning units.

Great crew, great service, give them a try, you will be satisfied.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I am a licensed general contractor for over 45 years.  I have dealt with  more than my share of Mechanical contractors.   Jesse Acosta  of Acosta Heating and Air Conditioning  could not have been more efficient, professional  or knowledgeable.   A real pleasure to have met. He is now  on my Conejo Valley contractors "A" list.</Text>

Jesse, the owner, visited our home in Simi Valley and carefully inspected our air conditioner and central heating and air unit. He answered all my questions and was very honest with his assessment.  The bottom line we needed to replace the unit, coil and lines, and Jesse provided us with the best options for our needs at a reasonable price.  I never felt he pushed us into anything we didn't need. Nor did he try to add cost to the project. Acosta finished the project on time and with no hassles. The work was top notch.  I am extremely satisfied with Acosta Heating and Air Conditioning and would highly recommend to anyone in need of service or installation.</review>< UserId.>

I called 4 places for an air conditioning quote. Acosta had the most thorough quoting process and the price was good. Jesse seemed most knowledgeable of all the companies that bid my job. I never had the sense I was talking to a salesman.  I had 6 yr old furnaces. He explained SEERs, so that I could evaluate the cost/payback, and I agreed with Jesse that replacing furnaces now, to get more efficient air conditioning was probably not cost effective for me. He was a strong advocate for permitting the job to avoid future problems when selling the house someday. This gave me confidence that Jesse is used to doing things right. I was not disappointed. Best of all Jesse is a good communicator. When install issues or options came up he gave me choices. When I had questions he called back quickly. His guys were courteous, clean and on time. A pretty good experience overall.</review>

Jessie patiently explained the various systems to us before we purchases.  After our contract was signed, Jessie showed up at the scheduled time and his crew worked carefully to protect our white carpetiing.  They completed the installation when scheduled and I am very satisfied with the completed work which included new ducting, heating and A/C.  I would not hesitate to recommend Jessie and Acosta Heating & Air.< /text>

The estimate was presented on the same day as the visit and it was more than fai.  Once I agreed to proceed the work was completed in less than a week.  This was a full house heating/air conditioning job when no system had existed.  I was thrilled.  The owner and all the staff were quick, professional and easy to engage.  My only complaint is that they were supposed to build a small fence around the commpressor and I believe this was forgotten.</Review>

<Text>These guys did a wonderful job.  Jesse is extremely knowledgable and came up with a great configuration for my HVAC system.  They did a lovely neat job which included items I had not thought of, like adding an additional service light with easily accessible switch in the crawl space.  They also widened the opening to the crawl space and made a custom door for it.  It's so much easier to get down there now.  He also helped me with my tax rebate information.< /Text><response>{'time': 1476993052349, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the great review...Really appreciated.    :-)'}</response>< rate>

Glad I called these guys. We had put off having our air condition unit look at as it wasn't working and fear of it needing to be replaced to which we could not afford. I pulled the trigger and called Jesse who came out and after a few moments of going over the unit, he told me it was a simple fuse. Jesse took the time to go over the whole system and show me what to look for in the event I were to find myself in a similar situation down the road. Professional and caring is what I got out of the experience and will call with out hesitation the next time I need help.

The best part about this whole thing is, Jesse didn't charge me a dime.

Thank you Jesse and Acosta air, you guys rock!</Text>

< review>
Jack is extremely friendly and very knowledgable. He’s not looking to up sale you either which is great since nowadays it’s all about people lining their own pockets. I had a $300 guitar in my hand he could’ve easily sold me, but I had told him I’m a drummer and merely dabble on the guitar to which he then pointed me in the direction of a Yamaha starter pack that came with a case and tuner for half the price. Love having a local business I can trust and support. I highly recommend stopping by and seeing Jack before hitting any big name store or online sellers.<//review>

I called looking for a double bass for my daughter since she was traveling from out of state and couldn’t bring hers with her. Although they did not have one, the store owner was extremely helpful, polite, and was able to refer me to another shop without any hesitation.

This place has a great mom and pop feel and I felt that I received excellent service even through the one phone call. Just based on the sweet and caring nature of the owner I recommend this shop!</review>

In full disclosure, I don't take formal lessons there, but the owners and instructors there have spent time teaching me many facets of music theory and application. Three of my sons take piano lessons there with two different instructors (Jane and Patrick). One of my sons also takes drum lessons with Ray. My daughter takes violin with Patrick and voice with Jane. My daughter also spends time with Jack and Andrea on guitar and song writing. She has grown so much as a musician and gets exponentially better daily. She actually just picked up guitar this year, and is already writing and performing her own songs. I cannot say enough great things about this family owned business. They really are more like family to us now and we've only known them for a year...great people. Oh...I almost forgot, we take all our instruments there to be worked on (piano, guitar and ukulele) as well.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Review>In a world full of impersonal Guitar Center and Sam Ash type music stores, this family owned business treats you like family. I’ve taken my Takamine acoustic guitar to have set up after years of storage and they made her sound better than when I first bought her. I’ve taken a 7 string LTD electric, a fender MiM, LTD M-50, PRS Santana SE, Gibson 60’s reissue Les Paul. The attention they give your instrument is second to none. What about their prices you ask!? Best prices I’ve ever gotten for grade A quality work.I highly recommend this music store, they go above and beyond for you. Everyone is super friendly. They offer music classes of all sorts as well. 10/10 business!< /Review>< Time>

<review>Beaumont Music Centre is a hidden gem with an impressive selection of instruments and gear for a small-town, mom-and-pop music shop.

I have purchased a ukulele and an acoustic guitar, along with other gear, from BMC and I could not be happier with the price because you cannot beat it.

The owners and other music teachers here are friendly and fair; just all around good people with a broad musical knowledge and a smile on their faces.

If you are in the area and are considering signing up for music lessons, I highly recommend BMC. Whether you want to learn music theory from a classically trained musician or to strum chord-progressions for those campfire moments, they have got you covered.

Beaumont Music Centre has four private studio rooms for lessons. There are keys and guitars in every room; a full drum kit in one and a grand piano. The place is super clean and air conditioned. The learning environment feels safe and comfortable.

If you have the chance, I highly recommend checking this place out. See for yourself this great resource for musicians, in Beaumont California.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

The owners are knowledgeable and support the instructors who are supporting their students--they even stayed open after hours to help me understand settings on a new amp. Also during this pandemic, the instructors were able to adapt to social distancing using video sessions and practiced wearing face masks and sterilizing surfaces.< /Text>< date>

This place is awesome! We originally bought a box guitar in store for my beginner daughter. We all noticed it was a little big but hoped she will grow into it in due time. After seeing her struggle, they allowed her to exchange it for a much needed smaller one. They give off a very down to earth homie vibe, which is great for my shy and quiet daughter. I totally recommend this place for lessons!!<//text>

They get positive vibes and encouragement all the way through from Andrea and Jack, who are both just awesome people and instructors. They’re super knowledgeable and experienced and I love how patient they are with my girls. They always work with our hectic schedule and offer great deals on all types of instruments. My daughter got her first guitar here and both my daughters have grown and learned so much during the time we’ve been coming.

Stopped in Beaumont music store recently for the first time to pick up a guitar capo....I was surprised at the selection of musical instruments....the numerous practice rooms and how well organized it was...for a small local store this place rocks!!!!
Of course stopping in a music store you always end up playing something...
I met Jack (the owner) and we started jamming....before I left I bought a ukelele...
My wife is practicing on it now (lol)
I am a new fan of this store<//Text>

<text>This place is a little gem of a music store in Beaumont, California! The owners are very kind and honestly try to help you get what you need at very fair prices. I had been looking for a conducting baton for a little while but was fairly unsuccessful at finding one in San Bernardino/Redlands. So I took a chance here and they were able to special order me one at a way better price than any other place I had been too! Great store!</text>< date>

<Review>Beaumont Music Center is AMAZING! Jack and Andrea have always given me such personal attention each time I come to the shop. I bring my kids every time, and they make them feel welcome as I shop around! Their prices are unbeatable, their quality superb. Each time I come, I walk away learning something.
This place is legit!  Support this business. Good people! It’s an experience.< /Review>< Pics>

Excellent place to learn music! My son has been taking guitar lessons there for over a month and he has greatly improved his skill. He comes out of class motivated every time and says that he really like his instructors. The instructors are very professional, knowledgeable and are great with kids. Classes are very affordable too. I'm so glad we found this place!!!< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Wow I have never been so impressed with such good customer service. They truly love what they do here. Teaching the kids patiently and with passion. I signed up my daughter for guitar class and she started the same day. When I picked her up she right away said I want my own guitar  and I want to continue coming here. For my daughter to say that is a 1st because shes into dance and gymnastics never though  she would like something with not a lot of body movement becuse shes super hyper. That goes to show that they put their 100% attention to them. Cant wait to continue bringing her and for her to keep learning. She went home the same night and the next morning and tried to learn her music book and played the guitar  so much. Shes in love and I couldn't be more happy.. Thank you for the patience 🙂👍🎸< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I’ve bought a ukulele, capos, music books, picks, a guitar strap, and multiple sets of acoustic, electric, and, just recently, classical guitar strings. If I ever have any questions, they know exactly how to help. They even taught me how to change my strings a couple years ago! I’ve also had my electric repaired here, and it’s been great ever since.

I have Andrea for piano and she is great. I appreciate her being very patient and approachable instructor. If you communicate your goals, she will help you get there as a team.</review>< pictures>

<text>I've known Jack Massengale since high school. He and wife, Andrea, own and operate the family run business, Beaumont Music Centre in Beaumont, CA. They have the ability to get any instruments to purchase (or rent for school band instruments). Guitars, drums, strings, woodwinds, etc. Lots of Lessons... just named your instrument. Very competitive. Friendly and helpful.<//text></record>

My band and I were in from Arizona for a New Years Eve concert at the Morongo casino. We had a little emergency before our gig and needed a few stage items. The shop was officially closed today but Andrea and Jack were close by and VERY COOL to open up their shop so I could buy the gear we needed. They are amazing and have a great shop!!! I highly recommend their shop and the music education they offer. Support local! Thank you both so very much!!!< /review>

Wonderful place for eclectic instrument knowledge. I learn so much just walking into this place. Not a boring "guitar shop" but and actual MUSIC shop. Lessons and a knowledgeable staff for just about any instrument. On the rare occasion they didn't have what I've needed they've found it and got it for me at fair price.

Close to home and with friendly people makes this my music shop for everything I need.< /text>

LOVE this family and the environment they provide for our family of 6. We have 2 in piano, 1 in guitar, and they will let me sit in and learn along with them when I can! BONUS: They are a vendor for multiple home-based charter schools! SYLB! (Support Your Local Business)<//Review>

Honestly, I went to this place by accident. My friend referred me to a nearby place I realized my mistake, but my kids and I are soooo happy we ended up here! Talk about feeling at home as soon as you walk in and it is WAY bigger than expected and the lesson rooms are incredibly impressive! We met a few of the teachers and signed up immediately. My girls have only had three lessons and have learned so much and are absolutely loving it. I can't wait to see how much they progress. ❤< /Review>

The Beaumont Music Centre has a warm family atmosphere with genuinely caring and patient teachers.  My daughter has been taking guitar and piano lessons here for about a year now and I have truly seen her make significant progress with her musical skills.  I highly recommend this place for music lessons and for buying/renting musical instruments, books and accessories - reasonable prices & very knowledgeable teachers/owners.<//Review>

I personally have extremely high expectations when it comes to music retail and teaching, and this place surpassed them all. They're knowledgeable  and always go the extra mile to help the customer. They have an awesome selection of guitars including all the accessories one would need. I was so impressed by the service they deliver to every customer, it became a personal mission of mine to  become a part of the BMC family.

<Review>Beaumont has needed a music store like this for a long time. Jack and Andrea and their staff provide excellent music instruction on a variety of instruments, and they are extremely knowledgeable.  They also carry a wide range of guitars, basses, ukuleles, amplifiers, band instruments, music accessories and music instruction books.  It is definitely a one-stop shop for all my music needs, and their prices are right in line with the big box guitar stores. The atmosphere is family-like and always friendly.  Thank you for such fine products and service !!</Review><Name>John Wiley<//Name><time>1506830625872< /time>< GmapID>

<Text>I'm not from the area, but I stopped by the store on my what to Joshua Tree before the new year. I was bringing my guitar and needed to replace one of the strings that broke. The lady there, who's name I did not get, was super helpful. She was friendly and especially informative about how I shouldn't leave my guitar in my car overnight because it gets cold and ruins the strings. It was a very friendly environment for someone like me who is new to music in general. She replaced the string and taught me something new so I appreciated that. Definitely recommend this place.</Text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1546638910587, 'text': "Hi Gabriel, thank you for the review.

<review>Best music store in Beaumont! Family owned business of whom Jack and Andrea are owners. They are two very kind and caring people very knowledgeable and professional in the field of music and instruments. They are also amazing music teachers and work very well with children. My granddaughter learned a lot from their expertise when she was taking guitar lessons. We thank them both very much!

Good little mom and pop music shop! Best prices on the best of things. I got my guitar restringed for under $20 (I dont exactly remember how much but it was cheeeaappp and excellent). They also support the local High School Band so that just gives you more of a reason to shop here!< /text>

One of our first post pandemic outings, and we're fortunate to dine at Brasserie SLO.  They have a good selection of beers and wines. At first glance their menu is not well-suited for vegetarians but they made up for it with many excellent starters, which we ordered quite a few: Barata with figs, Caesar (not vegetarian), Grilled Broccolini. For my entree, I had the Papardelle.  Finished off with a generous portion of their excellent pecan pie.  Everything was superbly prepared and tasted great.  We really enjoyed our meal in their courtyard.

Service was attentive and unobstrusive.  My only wish that they have maybe a few more vegetarian entrees.< /text>

Easily one of the best restaurants in SLO. The French toast is indescribably delicate and delicious. Their duck with ancient grains is beyond tender and flavorful. I’ve had nearly everything on the menu and am still impressed every time I return. The outdoor dining courtyard is also beautiful. The living wall of succulents mixed with the minimalist construction and cozy fire pits makes for a wonderful dining experience.< /Review>

<Review>My husband and I had dinner with friends on Friday night. Off the bat, we were told that they were out of the new York steak. Ok. My husband and our friend both ordered the scallops instead. They were also out of the scallops. They then ordered the octopus. It came with a curry puree and pickled cauliflower which were good.  However,  the octopus was heavy, heavily salted. I ordered the shrimp.  My shrimp was also heavily salted. Really disappointed...<//Review>< Pictures>

Great service, the food is perfection! My new breakfast spot, delicious coffee from a local company Ascendo; so amazing, better than any coffee shop in town! Don't get me started on the Parisian omelette, breakfast burrito-  the chorizo is incredible and so savory with the pickled tomatillos, and the 2 egg breakfast is the best I've ever had! They make their strawberry jam in house and its out of this world.  Also must try the huevos rancheros-phenomenal, and the oatmeal! Cant wait to try the rest of their menu. Took my friend today and she got the avocado toast, its vegan, she said its super delicious!<//review>

<Time>1584286522805< /Time><username>Aaron Steed< /username><Review>Last night my family and I had dinner at the Brasserie and loved everything about it.  The Championion Pizza was probably the best appetizer I’ve ever had and a truly unique flavor profile with truffles.  Also; the skirt steak was to die for over a bed of air fried Brussels.  The staff was organized and clearly took pride.  All of their pies are made from scratch daily and the ambiance was tops.  I think it’s the only restaurant in slo with sound enhancement speakers so you can clearly have a nice conversation without having to yell.  Will be back.  Everyone else loved, not liked, but loved their meal too.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>One of our first post pandemic outings, and we're fortunate to dine at Brasserie SLO.  They have a good selection of beers and wines. At first glance their menu is not well-suited for vegetarians but they made up for it with many excellent starters, which we ordered quite a few: Barata with figs, Caesar (not vegetarian), Grilled Broccolini. For my entree, I had the Papardelle.  Finished off with a generous portion of their excellent pecan pie.  Everything was superbly prepared and tasted great.  We really enjoyed our meal in their courtyard.

Service was attentive and unobstrusive.  My only wish that they have maybe a few more vegetarian entrees.<//text>< Pictures>

Easily one of the best restaurants in SLO. The French toast is indescribably delicate and delicious. Their duck with ancient grains is beyond tender and flavorful. I’ve had nearly everything on the menu and am still impressed every time I return. The outdoor dining courtyard is also beautiful. The living wall of succulents mixed with the minimalist construction and cozy fire pits makes for a wonderful dining experience.</Text>

My husband and I had dinner with friends on Friday night. Off the bat, we were told that they were out of the new York steak. Ok. My husband and our friend both ordered the scallops instead. They were also out of the scallops. They then ordered the octopus. It came with a curry puree and pickled cauliflower which were good.  However,  the octopus was heavy, heavily salted. I ordered the shrimp.  My shrimp was also heavily salted. Really disappointed...< /text>

Great service, the food is perfection! My new breakfast spot, delicious coffee from a local company Ascendo; so amazing, better than any coffee shop in town! Don't get me started on the Parisian omelette, breakfast burrito-  the chorizo is incredible and so savory with the pickled tomatillos, and the 2 egg breakfast is the best I've ever had! They make their strawberry jam in house and its out of this world.  Also must try the huevos rancheros-phenomenal, and the oatmeal! Cant wait to try the rest of their menu. Took my friend today and she got the avocado toast, its vegan, she said its super delicious!<//Text>

Last night my family and I had dinner at the Brasserie and loved everything about it.  The Championion Pizza was probably the best appetizer I’ve ever had and a truly unique flavor profile with truffles.  Also; the skirt steak was to die for over a bed of air fried Brussels.  The staff was organized and clearly took pride.  All of their pies are made from scratch daily and the ambiance was tops.  I think it’s the only restaurant in slo with sound enhancement speakers so you can clearly have a nice conversation without having to yell.  Will be back.  Everyone else loved, not liked, but loved their meal too.<//Text>

<Review>The beds are great and the store is very clean. My lower rating is because of the long wait... reduced hours (10 to 7 M-F and 10-4 over the weekend) a lack of high-demand beds along with staff being tied up with discussing membership and lotions are the primary cause of having to wait so long for a quick tan. Be careful with the spray tan.... I never had an even tan despite purchasing and using the recommended primer and following instructions.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1618951583979, 'text': 'Hi Melissa!

<text>Palm Beach has the loveliest ladies working there, it's always extremely clean, however the line is always long to get it, and the reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because u got a spray tan, and it sprayed unevenly and I had the almost orange lines around my hands and other areas.  I actually went back and canceled the next day.  🙃< /text>< gmapID>

<review>I went in today to discuss tanning options because I’ve never gone tanning in a booth before. I walked in uncertain and in need of guidance because I’m getting married in a few weeks and wanted to be tan. The girls worked with me so well and my spray tan had turned out so nice, I never thought it’d be this easy and this nice of a look. THANK YOU for making my first experience a great one and making my skin glow :) I recommend this place. I’ll be in tomorrow for a membership!< /review>< pics>

<Date>1549935299835<//Date><review>So I was just going to leave this at a simple 1 star rating. Due to the reply that PBT wants me to email regarding my review "if I am willing" I am going to be more detailed.  I have tried to contact multiple times and left messages and spoken to your store representatives and no one ever gets back to me.  I am so done wasting my time. One star is the lowest I could give.  I would give zero if possible.  Trust me save yourself the headache and go to ANY other salon in Redding.< /review><username>Brittney Woodruff</username><rate>1< /rate></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
The worst service possible. I stopped attending and then 3 months later they withdrew money out of my account and then it was a battle trying to get ahold of anyone for a refund. When I did, it wasn't for another 2 weeks until I saw my refund. Please, don't come here. Go to a gym and tan. It's MUCH cheaper.< /Review>

This was my first time tanning, and the girls in there were very informative and sweet.  Explained the process very well and were very knowledgeable.  I was comfortable the moment I walked in.  The salon is very clean and beautiful.  I am very happy I chose Palm Beach Tan!!!< /review>

I love PBT Redding on churn creek . The west   Redding  store is cold and the staff snobby and rude. I have been tanning at PBT Redding since their opening. The staff today needs more customer service and sales training. The original staff years ago was better trained. As a sales professional I can see novice training as of now. When I came back after not being on stay and save for 9 months. The sales associate offered me a single tan session without even asking if I wanted to reinstate my membership. I was shocked. I had to help guide her. I did reinstate my membership. I love this store and the beds. I plan on being PBT loyal for life. Not loving the new floors however; the lighting and atmosphere are amazing! please don't change. <3 Angel<//review>

Needless to say with the shorter times open I decided to cancel my membership. It was a very stupid marketing email on someones part. The least they could have said was to try and maintain prices we are being forced to reduce hours were open. But wait it's not cheap to go there at all!< /Review><user>108586290480596560289< /user><date>1469406481771<//date><gmap_id>0x54d2ecca31e58827:0xff2408fb9eeb806a</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>BEWARE!!! Though the tanning experience was GREAT and the facility is beautifully maintained...watch out for the automatic billing that will occur if you do what I did.  I was offered a lower monthly plan, as I was ONLY pre-tanning for a trip to the St. Thomas and I do not use tanning facilities routinely.  I stopped my membership on time as directed, but was unaware that my VISA card would continue to be billed every month after my cancellation, UNLESS I physically came down to SIGN my wishes to END the deal.  Unfortunately for me...3 months had already been billed on my card before I noticed and after speaking to their account person, I was told I was too late to avoid a 4th month's charges...even though it was not the first of the month, yet.</Text>< Pics>

This company is a RIP OFF. Do NOT auto debit with Palm Beach. ive tried to cancel for SEVEN months & they r still charging me. you have to "personally Appear' at your "home" salon to cancel (so they can bully you into keeping it) and their prices are a lie. i paid for GOOD beds but they put me in to ENTRY LEVEL ones that dont even work. im not paying an EXTRA $24  MORE every time to tan in a DECENT bed...."if you have a problem, call customer service"  well, that was the last straw. im never going back.</Review>

<text>Manny has been around for years and is well known but his customer service is the worst I have ever experience he talks to you like if you need him and just acts like he don’t care if you have single speed bike they will get the job done if you have a more advance road bike don’t go there they don’t know how to work on road bikes they are better shops for that</text>< Pics>

<review>Took my teens Schwinn bike in far a larger more comfortable seat. It was my very first time at this shop. Took the owners assistant 7 minutes to do. The owner is a really nice guy. Talked about having him customize a bike for myself. Will be doing business here again.</review>< pics>

<text>I passed down an original schwinn to my daughter that I never finished. We found all the parts needed here! The prices are maybe a little cheaper online but the quality is not compared to the face to face experience the Manny jr he was great! The experience of my daughter seeing so many lowrider bikes gave her inspiration to create hers. Will post picture when she finish building her bike .

Went to Manny's Bike Shop today for the first time. My son ordered a new Fixie frame and fork, and he wanted to swap his old Fixie parts for the new ones. Prior to going to Manny's, we went to another local bike shop that we'd frequented in the past. They told us that it would take 3 weeks to swap the parts because they had 1 job in front of his, and they weren't familiar with the new frame. They also didn't provide a quote, but told us they'd call with more information later. Needless to say, my son was frustrated and disappointed.

Things didn't sit well with me, so after leaving the bike there and getting home, Googled bike shops near me. Manny's was first on the list with an impressive 4.5 stars! I told my son about it and we immediately retrieve his bike from the first shop and took it to Manny's. In less than 15 minutes, Manny gave us a price along with letting us know that it would be finished today or tomorrow. My son received a call less than 2 hours later telling him that his bike was ready. We are both extremely satisfied with the service and price.<//review>

Manny's bike shop is monumental in our community... I am Taylor... father of rap artist / actor 'The Game.'  I'm 60 years old and I've been coming to Manny for the greatest service, smiles and some laughter I guess for about 50 of those 60 years. All in all... I have never heard one complaint or a disagreement voiced. For excellent bicycle service... Manny's bike shop is the very best!!< /text>

Took my brand new bike in to get a tune up such as adjusting the derailleur and lubing all the cables and it came out to be that they didn't do anything other than lube the cables, don't recommend dropping off your bike here for service since they do half-work and not complete work.</text>

Location:Good, Parking:Good, Service:Okay, Price for food: Okay, Indoor seating:yes, Overall: Been here once before and it was good. This time the service took too much time to come back to check on us and our empty glasses. The meals ordered also seemed to take longer than expected for hamburgers. The place was not that busy inside or for take out orders from what I saw. Kinda disappointed...<//review>

They're quick to give you drinks but really slow to take your order. It wasn't packed, but that is likely due to half capacity due to Covid. Took 15 minutes for them to finally get to us to order. I ordered a salad and husband orders a large prime steak(they don't ask how you want it cooked) and avocado roll appetizers. 10 minutes for appetizers, 15 minutes for husbands steak. My salad came 10 minutes after his steak! My salad was awful, So I waited for the waitress to come so I can change my salad. Well, it took more then 15 minutes, to which point my husband was done and just waiting for me to eat. I just cancelled the salad, and then we wait 15 more minutes for waiter to bring back our bill.  All together, time wasted.They are definitely not fast paced and could manage better!< /text>< pics>

<Review>Plenty of parking. This place does get very busy so expect to wait at least 45min-1 hour depending on the time of day you are going. As of 4/10/21 there is in door dinning. Now with that being said it is still not at 100% capacity which is why the long wait time. As far as our service at this location staff is very friendly our waiter was great and very professional. Appetizers and food arrived relatively quick for how busy it was and no mistakes made with some of our special orders which is always a plus. Would definitely eat here again.<//Review><user_id>110000799897960427070</user_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>BUSY. Be patient or show up on off hours.

They were out of the Hazy IPA I wanted but made up for it with another on draft.

Spicy Pig was great and filling. Nice atmosphere with excellent servers. I’ll be back!<//Text>< user>

We've enjoyed BJ's for years and the new Beer Club makes visits even more rewarding.   Elaine was awesome and navigated the new rewards with patience. Cheers!<//Text>

<text>First of all you need to wear a jacket because you're going to freeze if you eat late at night. I asked for a burger well-done and it was wrong they brought my wife food really late.. and to make matters worse there was a hair on my dessert. And be prepared to eat your food really fast because it gets cold really fast.  At first, they only offered 10% off my total. Totally ridiculous. Save your money it's not worth it. And prepare to beg for refills.😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpvxu3vqAw9hhDW8wpr2X-8O-UVVn964Yb-SxM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJxFWAki2KDBagvUrqcjqIdb9Ul5SUVlQQo1mV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwLoXZaqaFKKahALFwbuETp41kbIvWmvih33N0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvQtDo50vLbaVxyhqMzYtiiPmcvtci93aapg9O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

Jill was our server and made sure that everything was great.  Jill made recommendations that we went with and even with the mask on you could see a smiling face.  Food and service were outstanding.  I recommend for a lunch or meal when you want good food choices,  including vegetarian or great salads, served in a friendly professional fashion.  Will be back soon when in the area</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

They have opened Dine-in options. Their booths have extra plastic shields now. Food was great as always and loved their Pizzokie!

Great place to hang out with Friends and Family. Plenty parking available. They have hand sanitizers installed at several spots. Good customer service.<//Review>

< review>
Just visited yesterday and was not happy with our visit. Easiest thing in the world. I asked for double cheese and double pepperoni.... when the pizza came, the dough was visible through the cheese .... areas on the pizza just bare dough.... how do you mess up double pepperoni and double cheese. It’s pretty disappointing when the local dominos pizza has a better understanding of this concept. Our waitress was nice about it, I didn’t want a replacement because it would’ve taken forever just to get the proper pizza and my family is already done with their food. I just wanted the extra charge removed from our bill, which she did. I just felt extremely unhappy and unsatisfied being that it’s still covid season and we barely get out as it is...... only to be let down by a restaurant that is suppose to be good with pizza. Definitely never going back again.< /review>

<Text>We ordered calamari for appetizers,  they brought the calamari (wasn't hot) but failed to bring plates for us to eat off of. 😢, ordered fish and chips, the fries weren't hot either and had a lot of salt on them...I had to ask for a water refill, the waitress wasn't attentive....this was a bad occasion,  I keep saying we're not going back but we keep giving them second and third chances.< /Text><GmapID>0x80c335813ceac83b:0x7758fad7d263eec4<//GmapID><name>charles malone</name><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I have been to this location twice and my experience usually goes to the positive side. It's like other large chains such as loud, long awaiting time, decent food and drinks, large menu etc. The food was tasty and mouthwatering. This restaurant has several deals and offers such as “BUY ONE ENTREE AND TWO BEVERAGES, GET A SECOND ENTREE HALF OFF!”, “20% OFF LUNCH”, “SPEND $200, GET $25”, “DAILY BREWHOUSE SPECIALS”, “MOVIE AND A MEAL” and so on. The service was also appreciable considering the restaurant being as busy as it was.<//Review>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>Thanks alot bjs I ordered the 15 oz steak and you guys couldn't have messed it up even more at this point I should have just gone to stater bros and made the steak my self also you guys gave me a steak it was seriously 10 oz of actual steak and 5 oz of fat. Anyways this was a mistake to order from here today. I got to much fat and not enough steak also I got a raw steak so I had to cook it on my grill to medium rare hope you do better next time.<//Review>< pictures>

First to be sure, the location I'm discussing  is near Ontario Mills Outlet. I ordered from this location yesterday, and the customer service was nonexistent. I ordered through Doordash at 6:11pm, and there was a 2hour delivery window. It was Valentine's day, so I understood. That window passed and my husband called BJ's to find out what was going on. Ironically our delivery person texted me to let me know she was waiting in a long line to even get in the restaurant. There were no separate lines for delivery, pick up, or dining there. My husband was on hold for 30 minutes, so he called on a second phone trying to now speak with a member of management. My husband had spoken with 3 separate employees, before he eventually spoke with Katelin. She apologized and stated for us to contact Doordash and request a full refund, because the issues were the responsibility of BJ'S. Doordash gave us a $15.00 credit and stated BJ'S would have you refund the remaining cost. I'm upset for multiple reasons and just want this to done with.< /Review>

Like all the other large chains. Loud, long waits, decent food and drinks, large menu, really nice servers but service is so so. Full parking lot. Excellent menu with lots of options, good beer list. Food didnt look all that great, wasnt picture worthy but tasted good. I was pleased. Wouldn't pick this place myself but it was a decent visit and no real complaints on the food.< /text>

Change your reservation policy, improve your wait time then we will wait at your restaurant, why I have to check-in personally when wait time is 1 hour 30 minutes or more then why should I hang out there for that much of time, if wait time is 45 minutes or some then we can wait, and stop being rude on phone, if people like us support you guys then you guys are in business.

Allow waitlist by phone or through app< /review>

<Review>NOT COVID FRIENDLY - Menus not available, must scan QR code and download. However, they are in a bad data zone and the outside sitting is too far for their in house Wifi.
Slow service with infrequent visits, workers seem stressed and not service orientated.
However, food is good if not would rate only 1 star</Review><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

The food was ok, but not worth the price. The reason I only gave 2 stars is due to the service. It took the staff a half hour to come check in with us once we were seated, and only did because I spoke to the hostess about it. Then, it took about as long for us to get our food (which was not hot when it arrived). The waiter then left us a pitcher of water so he wouldn’t have to come by so often and we had to wait a further 20 min after finishing our meals for him to finally bring us our dessert and the check. Just because we have to sit outside now, doesn’t mean we should get worse service.<//Review>

I love their crispy with ham and cheese sandwich.  The pizza is good, wings, ribs, burgers, and appetizers.  They have food that tastes great!  I love BJs.  Amazing waitresses, very nice,  patient and polite, Torri was amazing this 2/14/19!  Great experience today.  🤗😍</Review>

Food was good, flavor wise. My only concern was that it was on the warm side. Could have been because we were a group of 8. A few others from our party had cold food, and some raw (not edible due to pregnancy and raw shrimp.) Taking away 1 star for cold food, and 1 for raw food.<//Review>

I called for pickup and they said 25 minutes. Actually was about 45. Then, it took me only 10 minutes to get home, by the time I got home, the food was lukewarm at best. Staff was pretty rude as well. Either eat there where you can send it back or eat somewhere else.<//Text>< response>

With Covid19 servers need to be more mindful of other people's food. Mr. Estaban at the Rancho Cucamonga took our drink order to another table. The other table were not wearing mask. They were discussing their order while talking over our drinks. When we brought this
to his attention he took offense and had an attitude, not cool.< /Review>

This is a very popular place!  The food was good and service was even better.  Ordered a pasta dish that didn't come with the chicken, but the server promptly took care of it.  Drinks are fabulous and the menu has so many healthy options.< /Text>

They used to chop the chicken salad up with the honey mustard mixed in. Today I asked 3 times to chop it and when it came, it was un-chopped. Had to send it back to the kitchen to have it done. Usually, I never complain about the food because it's always good. Better luck next time I guess...</Review>

<Text>It was okay. We had to go back in for utensils. Then we had to go back in for butter for the baked potato even though we clicked it on the order. Our Peruvian quinoa and brown rice medley was just brown rice. My Rib eye was over 50% fat and rare (blue center).</Text>< name>

An actual SPRING from a pen in the guacamole.  Can you believe this? Manager Lakeisha did not offer any comp(s) ie. Free new order of guacamole, free dessert. They simply took the order off the bill.  We were not looking to have a full free meal, as we always pay. A little courtesy goes a long way when you find an object in the middle of your food when you're eating.</review>

Deep dish pizza sucked ! Chicken tenders and fries tasted like old oil. Like the idea we can eat outside but service was just slow.<//Review>

<Text>Horrible service. Bad management. Ordered 2 different beers they had on the menu but they had to come back minutes later to tell me it's not available. Ordered Prime Rib also on the menu & took them even longer for them to come back yet again to tell me it wasn't available. False advertising & complete waste of time. Also the Clam Chowder they did give me wasn't cooked correctly or must have been cooked from earlier in the day. The manager Ryan who spoke to us after was not of any help as well. Actually don't know why he even bothered speaking to us when all he mentioned was what the previous 2 waiters already took too long to relay to me.</Text>< pics>

What a terrible experience! I used the mobile App to order my food at 4pm to have it picked up at 5:15pm. When I arrived at 5:15, they had not even started to make my order! To top it off my food wasnt even ready until an hour later! I had to wait over an hour after my pick up time which was an hour after My order time! RIDICULOUS.  #NEVEReat@BJs< /text>

It took forever for everything we ordered. Starting with our drinks they came all separate and my son drink took more then 10 minutes to get it. Appetizer the same way took for ever. The main meal came but my vegetables were already cold. Terrible service overall.
About three times waiters came with orders to our tables that belonged to somebody else. It seem that they were all new or lost providing service. Very, very sad. I don’t recommend going to BJ’s</text>

Tried curbside pickup today.  All slots were full and they were not answering their phone so went inside. Pickup was supposed to be 6:45 which is when I arrived. Checked in and they said maybe another 30 minutes. Didn’t get our food until 7:45, an hour later. What a disaster. If I hadn’t prepaid I would have left.</Review>

My mom's first time trying BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. She loved it! Celebrating my grandma's birthday and my grandpa for Veteran's Day weekend. Wonderful service and the Committed Double IPA was perfection. 😋 👌<//text>

The worse experience I've had with them. The employees were talking about other customers badly, one young lady was just screaming out of frustration multiple different times, and they told me my food was ready, it just had to be bagged up ( turned into 40 mins for a to go order ). I will never go here again. I'm very shocked at the Rancho Cucamonga location.< /Text>

<Text>Saturday evening visit. Told the wait was 45 minutes but saw and grabbed a booth in the bar instead in the first minute waiting. Group of four in the booth. The high tables in the bar seat up to six people. Good food and drink. Two waitresses working all the tables but still got order taken, food came quick and refills too.</Text><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c335813ceac83b:0x7758fad7d263eec4<//GmapID>< username>

I tried to visit here over the weekend but when I arrived there was a queue of groups waiting to be called for a table so decided to leave it for another time. I came during the middle of the week, I found the staff very pleasant and helpful, the food was tasty (I had the superfood salad with Cajun shrimp). The barman recommend a refreshing blonde beer I was happy with hi choice. Nice atmosphere with lots of sports TVs at the bar but you can be seated at tables as well.<//text>

This place has such a big menu. Sometimes I have to wait a little bit to be seated but it is also open seating in the bar area so if you are by yourself or with just someone else it's really easy to get a seat quickly. Otherwise you may have to wait 30 minutes to 2 hours for a table depending on how busy they and how big of a table you need. I usually always get pizza from here but I decided to venture out and have had a few different things and none of them have let me down. I also love getting root beer because it is so good from here. I think it comes from a keg.< /Text>

Ordered the dessert at 7:30 and didnt get it until 8, bill already paid. Almost got up and left without it. We showed up at a very busy time on a Wednesday night and I guess it was shift change. I wouldn't go there if I needed a quick bite...they seemed very overwhelmed<//review>< name>

One of my favorite restaurants. The avocado egg rolls are amazing. If you haven't tried them I recommend you do. So far I  haven't had anything I don't like. They have a wide range your sure to find something for everyone.  If you like rootbeer I recommend the root beer they have on tap it excellent.  They also have very good pizzas. The bar is a good place to wait if you happen to stop by on a busy night.  We normally eat in the bar area as it's usually less of a wait than the dinning area.<//Review>

<Review>We tried a new item on their menu, the Honey Smoked Brisket and bacon burger. Cooked to Perfection and it was fabulous! We also have the clam chowder and it came out nice and thick as it should be. We got outside seating because it was faster than waiting for an inside table. Definitely the place to go if you'd like to try beer flights or just have a nice variety of food to choose from!</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c335813ceac83b:0x7758fad7d263eec4</gmapID></record>

The resturant quality has gone down over the past few years... But the service is what keeps bring me back to the resturant bar with bar food. The bar tenders are engaging and entertaining.. easy to to have a few laughs at the bar with these guys.

If you have time to kill or want to impress you eharmony date.. take them here for good time and if it's happy hour drinks are cheap.. and if your date is a one hit wonder keep it on a budget.. till your dates earns a set at a nicer establishment.<//text>

I have Celiac disease and was able to eat the Gluten Free pizza without getting sick. So all in all a good experience. Food was good. Wife had Prime Rib and it was great. My buddy ordered a steak medium rare and it was medium well. Drinks were good if a little overpriced but definitely worth the trip.</Review>

We enjoyed ourselves. Especially my husband who is highly allergic to gluten. To our surprise and appreciation their gluten-free options had NO cross-contamination. Definitely going back!!!!</Text>

It took almost an hour to get seated! Yet, other parties were seated upon arrival. We placed our order and it took them 20 minutes to get us our drinks and let's not talk about how long it took them to bring out our food. First time and last there.<//review>

I like to call this place your safe bet for an outing with a large group. Everyone sort of knows what to expect. It won't blow you away but there isn't much to complain about either. The prices and food are reasonable. It is a nice place and the service has always been decent. Wouldn't consider it a go to place for a nice meal but when you're with a large group and no one can agree on anything this is a safe bet.</text>

This place has such a big menu. Sometimes I have to wait a little bit to be seated but it is also open seating in the bar area so if you are by yourself or with just someone else it's really easy to get a seat quickly. Otherwise you may have to wait 30 minutes to 2 hours for a table depending on how busy they and how big of a table you need. I usually always get pizza from here but I decided to venture out and have had a few different things and none of them have let me down. I also love getting root beer because it is so good from here. I think it comes from a keg.</Text>

We tried a new item on their menu, the Honey Smoked Brisket and bacon burger. Cooked to Perfection and it was fabulous! We also have the clam chowder and it came out nice and thick as it should be. We got outside seating because it was faster than waiting for an inside table. Definitely the place to go if you'd like to try beer flights or just have a nice variety of food to choose from!< /Text>

Ordered the dessert at 7:30 and didnt get it until 8, bill already paid. Almost got up and left without it. We showed up at a very busy time on a Wednesday night and I guess it was shift change.

The food was also good. The only complaint is that I got bit by some type of spider or bug underneath the table. I got bit 8 different times and I was itchy as soon as I got into my car. The floor was slippery when we were walking to the table. I think the floors need to be cleaned better or they need to spray to avoid insect activity inside of the restaurant.<//review>< pics>

Ordered the salmon, found two staples in the broccoli, they were not staples they looked like the bristles off of a scrub brush. I let the waitress know and she was very sorry and said I will be right back with the manager. She came back with our check so we paid it then she said my manager will be right with you, we waited more and no manager so we had get back to work and walked out.

So the manager is too busy to at least come over and say sorry for adding the steel bristles to the food, nothing, awful place to eat will not go back and will let my coworkers know to check there food as I found steel pieces in my plate which the manager had a lot more important things to do than to at least apologize.

I hope the cooks are washing their hands because they obviously are not paying attention to how the food is prepared.<//text>

They didn't ask if I wanted more bread. I wish the meatballs were more meatier, they were big but who knows what they were made of. The ice cream on top of a freshly baked cookie was luscious. Thanks for the birthday dessert. The pizza had too much dough and not enough cheese for the price. Quick service, less wait time with app. The spinach appetizer was good, with fresh light chips.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

No complaints. Good late night happy hour. Had good service. Good beer. My date wanted traditional wings but they only had boneless. To make up for it they gave her enough boneless wings to feed a small town. The food is good and lots of options make it an easy pick when your date says "I don't know" when you ask her what she feels like eating lol< /Review>

I have been to many BJ's and always enjoy the meals and service. Perhaps this location was short staffed the day I was there. Ordered appetizers before placing our meal order. Very slow in coming out. Got the appetizer only a few minutes before the main meal arrived. One of the meals was the incorrect one. Replacement took a very long time to come out. Our waiter was absent most of the meal. Was a disappointing experience overall with this location.</review>

<review>Went to dinner here with my best friend and we both ordered the wrong food because we didnt read what the picture on the menu was called.  At first the food we got served we doubted was going to be any good, but we decided to take a risk and put faith that the restaurant was going to have good food no matter what it was and to our pleasant surprise the food was oh, so delicious.  Thumbs up to their black and blue burger and beer.  Fried artichokes were amazing, also a surprise because i hate artichoke and the service was excellent.   Will come back to try more.  Price is somewhat expensive but in this case well worth it.  Kudos to BJ's  (interesting name as well, given the acronym.)</review><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Love this restaurant if you want amazing service visit on Thursday - Sunday and ask for Jonas he's the best server there is, he made sure my glass was always full and this pregnant woman didn't have to wait for anything. I came in on an Anniversary date with my husband and he never missed a beat. He was so great he was even helping other servers with their tables. He is amazing they need to promote and give him a raise! Best service ever!<//Text>

<Text>What a great place to eat the food is delicious the Ambiance was amazing and the waiter was really Charming... My great nephew only 8 years old loved the meatballs so much the waiter came over sat down and presented him with the recipe for his mom to prepare them at home! what an adorable moment... Keep up the good work you guys! You should implement the cell phone rule... everybody puts their phones in the Box until the end of dinner and as long as no one pulls a cell phone out you give them a percentage off of their meal... Just a suggestion other than that you guys rock!< /Text><Rate>5< /Rate><username>Cindy LOU Badgett</username></record></dataset><record>

<review>The spaghetti needed more sauce, for flavor. Could of had some parmesan cheese on top, but none was offered. They didn't ask if I wanted more bread. I wish the meatballs were more meatier, they were big but who knows what they were made of. The ice cream on top of a freshly baked cookie was luscious. Thanks for the birthday dessert. The pizza had too much dough and not enough cheese for the price. Quick service, less wait time with app. The spinach appetizer was good, with fresh light chips.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

To be honest, I love their pizza.  It's just way too expensive.  A pizza and pitcher set us back $75.  That's what sticks out in my mind when considering going back.< /Text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><review>I would normally rate this restaurant higher, but after tonight's experience, this location has left me disappointed.

Our server seemed distracted, and inattentive, as over the course of our meal:

Our drink order came back wrong, thankfully only for one member.

Our pizza was also wrong, as we ordered one with no diced tomatoes, and when our pizza was brought to us (by another waiter no less), it took almost an hour from the time we ordered, to receive the proper pizza. In addition,  our waiter never acknowledged the mistake when she did make her way back to our table.

Finally, after we finished eating, our waiter visited us again, and asked us if we would like our leftovers to go. We said we would, and also ordered our desert.

Before our desert was served, she already brought us the check, but our leftovers were still not here. No problem, as we were still eating.

However, we got desert, finished desert, and paid the bill, and even made it out to the parking lot, before we realized... She never brought the leftovers back, so we had to send someone in to retrieve them, which was another debacle as no one knew where they were.

All in all, even with everything that happened, no apologies were made, and no concessions were offered, which is what makes the incident stand out more from our usual visits.

Because, usually when we visit this restaurant,  one of our favorites, the food, and service, is always amazing, to the point where it's an experience we look forward to, rather than just being a restaurant we eat at out of necessity for eating alone.< /review>< pics>

<text>We had the avocado rolls, BBQ chicken pizza,  jambalaya, Cesar side salad, wedge side salad (changed out iceberg for romaine) two Moscow mules and a ginger beer. We asked for BBQ sauce on the side to drizzle over pizza (pizza didn't have any). Everything was very good. Service was great!

No restaurant does pizza like BJ’s does. Whenever I get a hankering for Chicago-style thick crust pizza, I wait until it’s a Monday (cuz that’s when large pizzas are half-off), I drive to the nearest BJ’s, and then I ask my mother to order me a large Gourmet Five Meat Pizza to satisfy my pizzalicious cravings. To make myself feel a little less guilty for all the meat, cheese, and carbs I plan to stuff down my gullet in one sitting, I’ll usually order their delectable BBQ Chicken Salad, or if it’s a to-go order, I’ll try to share the whole pizza with my family... maybe.

I’d totally recommend signing up for the BJ’s rewards program if you stuff your face with as much BJ’s pizza as I do, because those rewards add up fast and I love a good discount.</Text>

< Review>
First off the food was pretty good, the atmosphere had a Americana type feel to it, but a crucial issue happened. This could of happened because I went a Sunday night, but the place should of been prepared for the amount of guests they had. So I finished eating my dinner with my girlfriend and we ordered dessert, the Pizookie trio, waited a time of about 20 minutes. We saw what look like our dessert go by, the server was checking the ticket and it looks like it had the wrong table number or something because another 15/20 minutes our waiter, Josh, told us what happened. Our dessert was taken to another table and that they were making another order of our dessert. So it took about an hour total from when we ordered dessert to when we actually received it, thankfully by our waiter. Overall the dessert was okay, two of the cookies on it were overcooked and hard to break into, the ice cream and other cookie was great. The food, a burger and pasta, that we had were pretty good, as well as the craft sodas we drank. I'm may just go another day and time when they are not so busy.< /Review>

Service was a little slow but with that being said it was very busy. Server got our orders correct and was very sweet. The food came out hot and to our order. We had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated but they came out with samples for us to try while we were waiting which was a pleasant surprise. Would recommend.<//Text>

Inconsistency in the taste of the food.Our family waited 2 hrs. to be seated, when the Man at the desk said a 45 min. Wait. They also brought us the wrong order. As you can imagine it was a very frustrating night. They sent out the wrong drinks that also got sent back. I sorry to say but I will never go back to this B.J.'s. Other locations have been great.<//Text>

There were so many people waiting for open seats, i am glad our reserved seats weren't let go! The place was FULL! Although it was extremely busy our waiter did not forget about us. I had the prime rib medium rare and it was on point! The prime rib could definitely feed two! Place is  really loud with amazing TV screens for sports. By the time we left around 830pm there were even more people waiting to be seated. If you want to dine here during peak hours, be prepared to wait for seats. Thank you for a great time.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I tried to visit here over the weekend but when I arrived there was a queue of groups waiting to be called for a table so decided to leave it for another time. I came during the middle of the week, I found the staff very pleasant and helpful, the food was tasty (I had the superfood salad with Cajun shrimp). The barman recommend a refreshing blonde beer I was happy with hi choice. Nice atmosphere with lots of sports TVs at the bar but you can be seated at tables as well.< /text>< pictures>

This is a very popular place for date nights.  Went during a holiday week fairly crowded.  No bar room and happy hour only applies to the bar.  Awesome server, I wish I had her name, but she did a fantastic job.  Food came out in a reasonable amount of time and quality was good.  Did not view the restroom.  Overall good experience.</review>

I love Lazy Dog. They have some amazing appetizers. They also have great Happy Hour prices. I also love the fact that they have an early AND late Happy Hour. Dogs are only allowed on the patio which is fine with me because they have a really nice one. Awesome huge fireplace right in the middle. Some of my favorite...</Text>

<text>This BJ's has been one of my favorite places to go for the last couple of years. Until today. My party was cut off from alcoholic drinks. Myself and a group of coworkers decided to come here and have dinner. No different than what we've done many times before. But our waitress made a complaint to her manager that we were drinking too much. Really. So the manager cut our table off. Most of us are here on a weekly basis and have never had any issues at all. We were very confused by this. I ask the waitress why we got cut off. Maybe something happened? She simply said she didn't feel comfortable serving us alcohol anymore. She works at a brewhouse. It has a bar. With alcohol. Our group wasn't acting crazy. We've been coming here for years. This was a first. She said she's sorry but next time we come don't ask for her then. There won't be a next time. Then as we were leaving, a couple from our group wanted to go to the bar. They were met by a second manager who had a very nasty attitude, saying moving to the bar doesn't change the fact we got cut off, that we were harassing her server, and she's not gonna tell us again. I was shocked. We all just left. No reason to stay here. Absolutely horrible service here tonight. And most of use will not be returning to BJ's.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c335813ceac83b:0x7758fad7d263eec4<//gmap_id></record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Good beer, good food, and even better service. What more could you want from a restaurant?  I have been to BJs a few times and will return again. Be aware that BJs can be very busy at peak times, find a way to get a table through Google and your life will be easier. I used open table and seating was a breeze.<//text><name>Bradley Andresen</name><userid>100917584593490755232<//userid><pics>None<//pics>< Gmap_id>

<Text>My family and I love to come into BJ's and sit at the bar because it's quick and easy. We went Sunday at 7 pm. I got a turkey burger and my dad got the two Mahi Mahi fish tacos. Both were superb and We topped it off with a pizookie! Overall, great meal. The wait for the food was a little ridiculous at about 45 minutes ( because it was relatively empty), but the great taste made it worth the wait.<//Text><UserId.>112986324100418784853< /UserId.>< gmap_id>

< review>
Horrible diner tonight. Usually we have a pleasant time there and waiters are amazing. But tonight it was just so bad, when we order our drinks they made the tea wrong and forgot the sugar. Then once they brought out our deep dish pizza the server literally dropped it and left and forgot to bring out the spatula with it. No biggie we asked for it and waited. Once another server brings it we asked him for ranch and a refill. He said yah no problem will be right back. He never came back with ranch, drinks, nothing. Then our original waitress was attending every table but ours, I had water and I saw her multiple times with the pitcher yet kept over looking our tables. We didn't even have napkins or utensils. So we finished our pizza and left<//review>

First off, I have to say the food is great. I had the hickory brisket BBQ burger and it was delicious. Very good service. Also, the deserts are amazing. However, the wait times are ridiculous if you have a party over 5. I was in a party of 7 and we waited nearly an hour and a half on a Sunday at 3:00. Overall, come here for great food at a time that isn't busy.< /Review>

Had a short wait. Beer selection is huge, however, when I tried ordering the ones that I really wanted, they were out. Had to go through 5 selections before they had one I wanted. The food was pretty good. Steak was a little over done, but the pork chops were excellent. It's a bit pricey for a family of 4.</review>

Great place to go out for dinner with friends or on a date. Nice upbeat atmosphere large and open inside and many large tables for big groups. Large selection of beers and pizza and a wide variety of other Foods. Everything I have ever gotten at this location has been good. The staff has always been friendly and the place has always been clean. The lines can be very long hair sometimes though, but it's worth the wait.< /Text>

I was very disappointed.  I have never had such poor service and we go to BJs once a month.  We were there with our daughter, her husband and two young grandsons.  I even had to get the manager to get our table settings after our waiter gave us our salads and walked away.   We hardly saw our waiter on the floor so we were confused as to what he was doing while we were waiting for our meals and refills.  We love BJs, but this meal is giving me second thoughts.  Very Disappointed!<//text>

<Text>Ordered through Grubhub. 4 tri tip sliders and fish and chips. Delivered fish only. No fries or chips or tarter sauce.  Tried calling BJs “ONTARIO” where the order came from and phone just rang. No answer.  Paid $51 with Grubhub. Delivery.  Food was okay but disappointed. It’s like they think because it’s a to go they lower the bar.  Or should I suspect the delivery driver is eating our fries with the tarter sause?   Argg< /Text>< resp>

The experience in the restaurant after getting seated was fantastic.  The food was all very good, came in a timely manner and the service was great.  Leading up to this, it was a terrible experience.  First off, since we have a toddler, we wanted to order ahead using the app.  So, about 1.5 hours prior to our intended arrival, I used the app to create an order.  The app asks for location, arrival time, number of guests, and the items you want to order.  I plugged everything in and thought we were set.  Upon arrival at the restaurant, we told them that we had ordered online (like the app tells you to do).  The hostess looks in the computer and doesn't find anything.  Come to find out they don't hold anything past 30 minutes!  Why is there an option to include your estimated arrival time and why does it let you choose a time more than 30 minutes out if the restaurant can't see the orders beyond that time?  So, they told us there was nothing they could do and to create a new order in the app.  If you try and do this it won't work because your order is still pending.  You would have to cancel the order and start from scratch.  By this time we figured this out it had already been about 15 minutes.  We decided to skip that and just wait for the table.  We told the hostess and she said she will put us on the wait list. We said, no way, we should already be on the list!  Incredible.  Anyway, after that fiasco, everything was fine.  Moral of the story is, even though the app specifically says "we will hold your spot on our wait list", they don't if you arrive at the restaurant more than 30 minutes after your order.<//Review>

Best Beginnings is a great way to start your meal! End with a Oreo, chocolate chip, white chocolate or monkey bread pozookie they are all good! Full bar. Good burgers and fries. Sweet potato fries. Good pizza. Unique drinks. Loud but nice atmosphere. TVs displaying sports. Weekends can get busy since it's across from the mall. Sign up for rewards to get future discounts.</Review>

<review>I was very disappointed.  I have never had such poor service and we go to BJs once a month.  We were there with our daughter, her husband and two young grandsons.  I even had to get the manager to get our table settings after our waiter gave us our salads and walked away.   We hardly saw our waiter on the floor so we were confused as to what he was doing while we were waiting for our meals and refills.  We love BJs, but this meal is giving me second thoughts.  Very Disappointed!<//review><GmapID>0x80c335813ceac83b:0x7758fad7d263eec4< /GmapID>< rating>

I went for a quick lunch where the service was so long, we were late back to a meeting. Just to get some condiments and a second serving of soup for the all you can eat lunch was terrible. My bf asked for his second soup serving as soon as they dropped off the first and it still took almost 15 minutes for it to be delivered.<//review>

<Text>BJ's has some of the best pizza you'll ever find an some great beer choices to go right along with it! The inside of this restaurant is always clean and they have a separate bar area to allow you to enjoy your meal without yelling that sits a bit higher than the rest of the booths. Plenty of flat screens adorn the walls throughout the restaurant (including the bar area) to catch the latest game!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>I came from Miami to san Bernardino , after graduation ceremony. We came to eat at BJ’s because i love to eat in Miami BJ’s,
But here front desk service not impressive at all
At the front receptionist told us to waiting time 50-60 min , n we try to sit at the bar , but literally so many tables were empty but they don’t care, we asked so many tables are  empty why we have to wait , the front desk gives us the answer doesn’t matter  we told u to wait so u have to wait
The 0 star for customer service..
Rest of the stars for food n waiters service  are great!!< /review>< gmapID>

<text>Mediocre visit; I've never seen any restaurant burn spinach dip,  but they found a way at this location. Also,  our waitress was nice, but she only checked on us after the food arrived twice in an hour; maybe they were unusually busy? At least the drinks were good.</text>< Rate>

I give this 5 stars because I can't think of a bad thing to say. We had several plates of Appy's and the beer was good. Further to that, the bar tender (I wanna say Colby) was fun to go back and forth with. I thought I tasted cloves in a sauce and asked him to ask the chef....... he came out and hollered "Hey Canada" to get my attention ....... then gave a big thumbs down with a smile...... no cloves.<//text>

It took about 3 hours to get sitted, according to the hostesses our party of 13 was big to accommodate. Yet once sitted, we were service quick and food was hot and delicious.<//text>

<text>This place is pretty much like any other restaurant ( such as, sizzler, chili's, or TGIFriday ). The service is nice but it's what you expect from any place. Our table ordered an appetizer and a meal but the appetizer did not come put first. That was something i did not really mind but it was something that is worth mentioning. All the food was really well made but the garnishes were a bit scattered. I would expect it though since it was fathers day and there were a lot of dad's. Bathroom was clean and fully stocked. The atmosphere was casual. I enjoyed it but it's wasnt amazing. Nothing wrong with this place. I recommend for anyone that would like to sit and chat with friends or family while eating good food.</text><userid>105334898814760360510< /userid>< Pics>

Not a badge place for food and beer. Wait can be long. Weekday lunch time is better in terms of wait. Service is good. Menu is too big IMHO. Appetizers are good. There are healthier options also.<//review>

Burgers were ok, handmade but service was poor. Elyssa C was our server. Finished water before burger was delivered and it was not refilled until burger was done and had to ask for it and a 2nd lemonade for fiance as well at that time. Asked for a 2nd order of fries but was brought the bill instead.<//review>

Long wait, couldn't hear the mumbling waiter over the music, I'd ask him about a meal and he would point at the menu(thanks bud I already go that...lol), expensive, they got my order wrong and the food wasn't even cooked properly.  Definitely not the best Father's day dinner I've ever had....</Text>

Not the best BJ's experience I've ever had, but it was decent enough.  It was quite crowded when we went (Saturday night) but we managed to find a table in the bar area.  Service was okay for the amount of people there.  Unfortunately some of the dishes we received were a bit overcooked, but like I said, not too bad.<//Text>

Waitress stopped by every 30 min we were there for 1.5hrs didnt get our food till about 45 min in and my pizza was horrible I asked for extra sauce and jalapenos on a specialty pizza I got no extra sauce and the jalapenos were not cooked on the pizza. I did not get charged for the pizza but I also didnt eat anything...because i wasnt going to wait another 45min... 2nd time I've had a bad experience at BJs I dont know that I'll try a 3rd time.</text>

The whole slab of ribs was dried out with burnt pieced, well, well, well done and very salty. I want to say OLD MEAT, warmed up.
I also had tortilla soup which was salty and was not hot. The soup had no tortillas inside.
If I'm going to spend a hundred dollars on food again it will not be here.
The food was not good at all, I left unhappy and hungry. Not wanting to make a complaint.

<review>Overall it was good experience. I've been to many BJ's around the nation and this was just another visit to BJ's. I will say the wait at this location was well over an hour for a party of 7. This was a bit frustrating considering we were told a shorter wait time and by the one hour mark we were passed up for other parties (that came in after us). Other than that, food selection and quality was good, beer selection was good (like all BJ's), and service was great. Great experience overall with the exception of the long wait. If you've been to a BJ's before, this is no different.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c335813ceac83b:0x7758fad7d263eec4<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

First off I would like to say that I had an amazing experience coming to this restaurant due to the great service and delicious food. I came here last week and ordered some wings as well as other appetizers and everything tasted incredible, just right how I like it. I just had to ask the waiter who cooked my food. He responded with the name, Ramon, a new cook they had just hired recently. Everytime I come now I will specifically ask for my order to be cooked by him because he honestly does an amazing job. Overall, excellent experience!<//review>

This place needs new management, it used to be a fun and efficient place, now they can't get a handle on their customer demand, to the point that on their peak hours they loose upto 40% of their business due to lack of staff.</text>

I ordered the tri tip and it was all fat will not order or go there again.  Service sucked and it took about an hour to get my steak cause of the tri tip. On top of that they brought me my steak and that's it. No sides or anything. The drinks suck the bar tenders need to fill up a glass that we pay $12 for and actually make it right as well. Overall I will not be going back to BJs again.</review>

Not a badge place for food and beer. Wait can be long. Weekday lunch time is better in terms of wait. Service is good. Menu is too big IMHO. Appetizers are good. There are healthier options also.<//text>

Food was good though the service was kind of slow, it was kind of full on a Sunday after 3 pm. Overall it was a good experience.<//Review>

<Text>You can order online but you can not pay with gift cards, so we went in but they won't honor online prices, was playing messenger with host since manger kept sending him she finally comes out and had no logic explanation why they can't honor online prices, another manger comes out explain the same thing, I'm not dumb I get it but it still unfair to the consumer finally they decide they must charge me for something like a drink or chocolate chips for the coupon to work, I didn't think that was fair but I agreed , finally after 20-25min we finally check out and I'm charged for one something I didn't walk out with and we get home our food was extremely cold , we asked for extra sauce we got almost no sauce the pizza had to microwaved and the garlic knots were a bit hard and tasted nothing like garlic! My experience here was not a good one!  the girls were a bit young so maybe it just want a big deal to them, but for a mother trying to feed a family of 4 we rely on your deals and value to allow our children to experience other restaurants and making our hard money stretch, so being charged for something your not walking out with does strike a nerve. And leaving with cold food and not how I ordered it felt like a waste of a trip.< /Text><name>Martinez Family< /name><Rating>2< /Rating><Pics>None</Pics><user>100352475159386828424< /user>< GmapID>

New lunch combo comes with a Pizookie! It doesn't get better than that. Food was a little bit slow, but probably average for most comparable sit down restaurants.</Review>

It's probably pricier than it should be, but BJ's has delicious food and a fun atmosphere. It's like a Chili's but with a little more of a party atmosphere. The service was actually pretty quick given that we had a 20 person group, although the waiter did seem kinda cranky for that reason as well.< /Review>

Great crowd, service and place. But if it windy and you are getting take out find a different place to stand because the servers are constantly going out that door. My fries got cold standing their waiting for my 2nd order. Thought u was going to have some hot crispy fries in the car in the way home. Nope! Not their fault though.< /Text>

<Review>Wide variety of good food and good beer. Staff is great. They have probably dozens of TVs all over the walls, but I can never convince them to put on Forrest Gump for me. I've even brought in the DVD to make it easy on them. I've also tried to get them to play a tape of one of last year's playoff games instead of the playoff game they had on. I swear, if it wasn't for the food and beer and staff, I'd probably go there less often.<//Review><user_name>Danny VD<//user_name>< response>

The food and the service was fine, no complaints. However the outdoor patio was filthy , today was a really nice sunny day and we originally set outside but then ask to move inside because patio area was so dirty. They need to sweep and clean the area the patio also smelled bad like old food and beer😝  Does not seem like it has been cleaned in many days.< /review>

I have a nice lunch there every other week. The service and food have always been great. The waiters also make apparent the daily specials and lunch menu, saving me a few bucks on a meal already worth every penny. All the lunch only piadinas and pastas are delicious, so if you make it there between 11AM and 3PM (which I believe are the lunch hours), you're in store for an amazing discounted meal. If you aren't there for lunch, the other items I've had on the menu have also been great, especially the pizzas. And of course, the pizookies are a great dessert to make your visit feel whole.< /review>

I came for Happy Hour. They have good prices on food items. I wanted  to try a margarita  but there are no margaritas on the happy hour menu. $9 for a margarita is too much when you are thirsty. The Root Beer Ribs were tender but too spicy. They made my mouth burn. The chips and salsa were good. Mozzarella sticks were just okay. Spinach dip was the best appetizer at our table. We all came for a BJ Pizookie. We ordered a peanut butter,  a white Macadamia, a salted caramel, and a chocolate chip one. They were the best desserts.  Service was good. Just need to add a margarita to their happy hour menu</Review>

<Review>Hint: Download the BJs app and put your name down to save time before you arrive
This restaurant has great service for my sisters birthday very accommodating to my grandmother and the balloons we brought to celebrate. The servers all have tablets to quickly put your order in. The atmosphere is a beautiful exposed brick brew factory feel. I’ll be coming back to Bj’s soon the pizookies are delicious< /Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< pictures>

<review>Service is excellent, food is tasty, prices are reasonable, and BJ's always hits the spot! The burgers are juicy and flavorful, the steak is made to order and the tri-tip/philly sandwiches are crave-worthy. I've never had a better deep dish pizza and if you have never heard of a p'zookie... do yourself a favor, try and save some room and order one for dessert. After about 5 pm the restaurant starts getting full towards happy hour and dinner-time, but if you can make it in slower hours you wont be disappointed. BJ's is an occasional treat for me being a budget minded individual but I never experience buyers remorse splurging on a meal out at BJ's. Their adult beverages are delicious and there is enough of a variety that there should be something to sate every bodies taste. Being a brewery if you are a fan of beer there is a sampler beer thing that gives you a taste of several of BJ's home brews and for guests under the age of 21 their root beer is quite good.</review>< Rating>

Food was good once we got it. Service was awful. We didn't get refills on our drinks half way through our dinner. Our waiter went home never told us and left. A waitress came and said she would we be waiting on us.< /Text>

<text>This is a great place to eat; me and my friends ate here and said it was great even though it was busy they got their food with an appropriate time frame and the staff was very professional, this place makes everything to order their food is fresh so when it’s busy it may take a little longer but the food will always be good in anything and everything that you need taken care of the staff is always open and willing to accommodate each customer to the best of their ability.</text><Date>1514268676456<//Date></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Food was good. Only issue was the service. Basically took our orders and never saw her again till after we finished our food and had to pay the bill. No refills. No check ups. And one of the orders were wrong. Would have been a worst rating but got comp for the incorrect order. Apparently she was busy.

Sat at the bar and had lunch. The pizza I had was good, nothing phenomenal, but it was good. Draft beer selection is better than most places and it was cold. Service was great. I never had to flag anyone down, which is why I like to sit at the bar in places like this.< /Text>

Good food, good service, nice atmosphere. If you have been to any BJ's, then you know what to expect. The waitress that served was was exceptionally gracious because she arranged for us to sit with friends that were already seated in a separate section.< /Review>

<Review>Ordered takeout from this place. The lentil soup made me sick and tasted like it just wasn't fresh at all. Had to go to the doctor and miss work. They also skimped on the order of boneless wings.. Barely weighed 9 oz. when they promise 16 oz. The BJs in Chino Hills is way better.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures></record>

I visted Bj's with a friend. There was nothing that really stood out for me. It was a typical dine in restuarant environment. I had the veggie pizza which tasted ok & the host was polite. Two complaints: The host disappeared in long increments of time making it annoying to request something (including the bill). I just believe the host just had to many tables to service at once. Second complaint: It was entirely way to dark inside. I had to literally use the flashlight function on my phone to read the menu.<//review>

Great menu selection! The Mediterranean Tacos on the light menu are amazing, and I tried the Peruvian Quinoa Salad for the first time. So good!! We were celebrating a friend's birthday, and BJs presented her with a complimentary full size Pizooki. If you've never had a Pizooki, you haven't lived!< /Review>

Now I love BJ's. Like love BJ's. I also understand when it is busy the time it may take for somethings. But the lack of checking in and taking almost 50 minutes to cash out is not acceptable. Like I'm giving you money. When I spoke to the manager all I got was I'm sorry here's your change and the waiter wanted to say sorry. Really. The whole night was like this. Where is your passion for being a manager. I matter just like every other customer in there and you wanted to hurry off with no compassion. It might be a while before I come back and if I do it will be for the bartenders because everytime and I mean everytime they are amazing.<//text>

I've been to BJs before and enjoyed it, but this location was not great. Our waiter was rude, and hard to find. The food was just ok, but absolutely not worth the cost. The only thing I enjoyed was the Irish red ale.</review>

Been going to BJ's for years but this was the most disappointing experience ever. Ordered a deep dish BJ's special pizza but after 1.5 hours and 3 tries they still brought my pizza out cold and soggy. I finally ordered another entree. The manager comped our meal except for our beer. This was my worst ever BJ's visit!!!<//Text>

<text>BJ is a bit similar to yard house, they target similar customer.  I enjoy this over TGIF or Danny.  The price different isn't big, but BJ offer more choices and more important better food. Their lunch special here is pretty decent, some of people in the group wasn't too happy with the portion. I am more than satisfied with my order which is the chicken stripes with wedge fries.  Those were one of better tasty chicken stripes.  The fries could be better but again this is lunch around $7 is a good deal.</text>< Time>

<text>My experience was not that great the sad part is it was not crowded. .ordered appetizer had to send back , once returned it was still not correct. My soda was flat I never received my soup and to top it off we talked to the manager and she adjusted our check by 4 dollars. What a disaster.
THanks for ?? Good luck if you go there. .< /text><user>118281316130280091340< /user><resp>None< /resp><pictures>None< /pictures><Name>Spicee Pookee<//Name>< rating>

Took my gf there for a celebration. Took 10 mins to get a seat. Christopher was or waiter. He took forever to get to is the 1st tine just to get our drinks. Then we waited longer to get our order taken for food. We asked for the check, he brought us that pretty quick. But he took forever to come back to take our money. We had to dang near walk out of the restaurant for him to acknowledge that we were ready to go (that's what I thought asking for the check means). We talked to a manager, I don't remember her name. We told her about our horrible experience and terrible customer service we received. She said she would talk to him. I doubt she did. I have a feeling we won't be going back there for a long time< /Text>

First visit at this location with friends. We order the brussel sprouts from the appetizer menu and they were brought to the table overcooked "burnt" and dry with no sirrachi sauce on the top.  More disappointing is that our server as nice as he was brought them to the table.   He should not have left the kitchen with the item.<//text>

(If management reads this talk to both the women serving the tables at the bar) Very disappointed with the service at this location. While waiting for our table, our group Headed to the bar. Ordered drinks and appetizers. Both our waitresses were RUDE!
Later when our table was ready one of the waitresses told us to leave our drinks and apps as they would be moved to our table.
We arrived at our table and had to ask our new waitress to bring our stuff over. Finally our apps and now warm beers arrive and we ordered.
I would not recommend this location if you want to dine at bjs I recommend visiting the location in covina.</review><Rating>1<//Rating></record>

<Review>BJ is a bit similar to yard house, they target similar customer.  I enjoy this over TGIF or Danny.  The price different isn't big, but BJ offer more choices and more important better food. Their lunch special here is pretty decent, some of people in the group wasn't too happy with the portion. I am more than satisfied with my order which is the chicken stripes with wedge fries.  Those were one of better tasty chicken stripes.  The fries could be better but again this is lunch around $7 is a good deal.< /Review>< Pictures>

I had the opportunity to visit this restaurant with my family. Was a nice clean restaurant seemed clean a bit dark.Service was just ok.Not really a family oriented place didn't feel comfortable. Haven't been back. Food was over priced for the quality.Took a long time to get served.,Wouldn't recommend.</Text>

Then it takes an additional 30-40 min for our food to come out. When we get it 3 meals were cold. Our waiter was really nice and I am thankful we had a nice waiter. The service is extremely slow and food comes out either luke warm or cold.. now on to the bathrooms. When you go to the bathroom the stalls do not lock. A lady almost walked in on me. The toilet paper was on the floor.. eww. There was trash on the floor as well. Now if you don't mind being in an environment like that then cool be my guest and spend 2+ hours for something that shouldn't take that long. I hope they either hire more staff or get things in order. I will not return to this location and will tell all my friends and family the same. Very disappointed in the service for the price I paid for it.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Text>Horrible experience here. We had a party of 6, and they mixed up two steaks and had to make a new one. The new steak took so long to come out that my boyfriend had to eat alone, as everyone else in our party had finished. The steak they brought out was tough and not cooked as ordered either. I ordered a side of steamed broccoli which came out extremely hard- like it wasn't cooked at all! Also it took them over 10 minutes to bring out a water and a spoon. Not to mention the staff was unfriendly and cafeless. Bad first impression! I will not be eating at a BJ'S ever again.<//Text>< Pics>

Large craft beer selection and fresh pub food.

Kept going back after my first time. I believe they also offer a large selection of home brews.<//Text>

The food was ok but not for the prices they charge, I think it's a little too much. $17 for a small pizza, yea I would have expected for it to be better than just ok. Our server was great thought very helpful and attentive.</review>

I had to ask what was taking so long, the host had not reply. Then she flat out lied and said we did call you but someone took your table. We get seated 10 min later. We finally got menus, but that's where it ended. Server walked around handing out drinks, glanced over a few times and continued about her business. Got up and left 20 minutes later< /review>< Pictures>

Typically I have a great dining experience at this Bj's (5 stars) but a recent experience at this Bj's was deplorable. A server namer Tai made himself scarce through-out the entire time a guest and I were there. I'd request a different server. He's unprofessional and rude. I waited 20 minutes for him to collect the check and he did not return to collect it. I asked someone else where our server was and they said they'd check. About 7 minutes later I saw Tai walking around and not tending to any of the guests instead chatting with other employees. He closed out my check (after another server brought it to him) decided to keep my change WITH-OUT asking me first or providing me with a receipt. I approached him and asked him for both and his response was, " oh you want your change?" He tossed the receipt on the counter and handed me the incorrect change. Needless to say, I asked for the managers business card as to handle the situation later. I didn't contact the manager as I felt he should be given a chance to improve but if he's still being unprofessional I'd say simply report him.<//Review>

<Review>This is your typical BJ's, great selection of pretty good foods, lots of seasonal mixed cocktails, as well as craft beers.  The service is usually pretty good, with not a long wait after you've ordered, Just a bit on the slow side with drink refills, or I could have give more stars.< /Review>< Pictures>

<rating>1<//rating><Response>None< /Response><Text>Horrible experience here. We had a party of 6, and they mixed up two steaks and had to make a new one. The new steak took so long to come out that my boyfriend had to eat alone, as everyone else in our party had finished. The steak they brought out was tough and not cooked as ordered either. I ordered a side of steamed broccoli which came out extremely hard- like it wasn't cooked at all! Also it took them over 10 minutes to bring out a water and a spoon. Not to mention the staff was unfriendly and cafeless. Bad first impression! I will not be eating at a BJ'S ever again.<//Text>< userid>

Honestly this is the best food chain in America haha. They have a very wide selection of menu items as well as a huge taproom. Pizza, pasta, burgers, soup salad there's all kings of food here you can even get Chinese food of sorts. Their blonde is my favorite beer here bjs never fails to deliver. Always leave here happy Prices are very reasonable<//review>

What a wasted of time. Came here for dinner with a couple friends and left after being blatantly ignored. They seated other parties that came in after us. I had to ask what was taking so long, the host had not reply. Then she flat out lied and said we did call you but someone took your table. We get seated 10 min later. We finally got menus, but that's where it ended. Server walked around handing out drinks, glanced over a few times and continued about her business. Got up and left 20 minutes later<//review>

Place is a chain of brewpubs. Stout was good, I imagine other beers are good, too. You get a 12 oz pour. Service at lunchtime was very slow and impersonal. Food was ok, nothing special. Parking was a mess, can't really see what all the fuss is about.< /text>

<text>Ordered The BOGO take out this eve. I'm still in shock! Ordered x2 Chic Alfredo. Got home, serving kids, popped a broccoli stalk in mouth only to learn that it was the ONLY stalk 😠 and ONLY enough sauce for x1 entree. I apologized to kids like, its better dinning in right??  I'm still in shock so I'm not even mad yet! Tomorrow I will be. Don't do take out pasta or maybe takeout BOGO, I don't know what pissed them off for me to deserve this despite having great burthday parties there.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<text>Food is great but employees are not very nice. The hostess in the front are rude when checking you in. Also the waiters there are not very attentive. I went with a large party of 25 and they mixed up their food, they never came for refills we had to ask them every time. Both my visits were with large parties and let’s just say we only stated cause we were hungry.<//text>< pictures>

<review>The service was good, but the food is very average in my opinion. I had avocado egg rolls, the Hickory Brisket & Bacon Burger, and Cucumber Jalapeño Margarita. The egg rolls were ok, but not as good as Cheescake Factory. The burger was average, and the margarita was too sweet for my taste.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Me and some friends came to BJ , I have a friend that it’s vegan and she ask the waiter a question about the menu, it took her one hour to find out what we asked her about the menu she didn’t know what the menu was, also my beer was worm and it was really disappointing usually BJ has good service but today it was just disappointing that the waiters don’t even know there menu also they need better communion skills.< /Review>

Went with my 3 co workers for a monday night and was there for 1 1/2 hrs. Waited to get our food for about 30 mins. Finished in about 20 mins. And the remainder of the time we waited for the waiter to bring our check and he didn't come by at all during that time.<//review>

We placed a phone order,  for my self and coworkers. the food was not presentable. The advocado egg rolls where a lil burnt and looks like it was thrown in the box . Another order was forgotten and we order a club sandwich and got chicken on pita bread . Will not be ordering from there again< /Text>
