Great stop if 299 is your route from Idaho or Eastern Oregon to Redding. Deli food, snacks and fully stocked grocery, including produce can meet any travelers' wants or needs. The staff is friendly & helpful and their bathroom is tidy & clean. Whole rotisserie chicken was delicious & only $6.99.  Just North of Mayers Hospital, it's super easy to find & fair priced fuel is right next door.</Review>

The best fresh produce, reasonable prices, and great service. Store is very organized, clean and customer friendly is an understatement. If you Need it they most likely have it and I suggest this Store before Dollar general not because of prices but quality name brand goods and a clean friendly environment. Rock on Rays!<//review>

I like shopping at Ray's food place. That is where I buy my meat products. They have good deals and it is always fresh. The people that work there seem to be pretty nice. I do recommend that you buy other items elsewhere like  Dollar general.</Text>

Way too expensive for poor quality goods. The produce is terrible, half rotten in a day or two in general. The summer is better but not by much. At least the staff is pretty nice and helpful, not their fault the company has bad buying policies.<//Text>

Rays is a overpriced overrated and not simpathic to its coustermers. They have price gouged locals to the brink of going hungry. I wouldn't give them a star one even if I held the heavens in my own hands. No stars for rays!!!! They made me pick a star rating so I did . no stars for rays.<//text>

Very nice people. Big parking lot. Only quality store for miles and miles. If you are traveling through this part of the State, STOP, stock up.

<review>Ray's is useful, if not great.  Good to grab easy staples, although shelves tend to be empty of key items frequently.  Wine choices pretty slim, better beer choices.  Little fresh produce, mostly processed foods on shelves.

When shopping here, you need to be aware that the remoteness of the area affects the price. The selection is also limited. Oddly enough their chocolate and wine offerings are clearly carefully chosen, while the cheese section is is a bad joke.<//Review>

While working in the area discovered this full service market, they make pretty good pre-made deli sandwiches and have a huge selection of hot sauces and BBQ rubs plus many more lunch and picnic fixins.< /text>

I decided to start Jan 1, 2021 with a private surf lesson! Phil was my instructor. He was very patient and a great teacher. There were times I wanted to stop because I was so cold but he pushed me and I ended catching more waves than I expected.
I would highly recommend beginners (like me) to take a private lesson from Surfari Surf!< /Text>

<text>My fiance went to the shop in Florida and got a lesson and absolutely loved it , so naturally when we went to San Diego we had to go back! The owner was actually there from Daytona and so I was able to get a lesson from Rick. We spent Saturday- Tuesday surfing and loved every second of it, this experience completely made the trip. We met some really awesome people at the shop and everyone was just so friendly and wanted us to do well and succeed surfing. Thank you to everyone at Surfari, we will defiantly be back!!</text><time>1603330455830<//time><Name>Mercedes Vigil</Name><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtEaAwdJz_2AB_krjOfTQjZTNFmzRjtXWK2YRG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< rating>

<Review>We are very happy with the experience. The long red boards are awesome for beginners, you can happily sit or kneel on the board and peruse the bay with leisure. The board is very steady. The owner of the shop was awesomely accomodating. The price for 24 hour rental is only 20$, less than the Groupon 22$ rate. there are lockers for your valuables. the only downside is carrying the large board about 500 yards to the bay, but if  you double up on the chore it's manageable. Great experience, highly recommend. Virginia R< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

Friendly employees and reasonable prices. My daughter had her first lesson here about 8 years ago and we were just back a couple weeks ago to rent a longboard for me and wetsuit for my son, glad to see they are still there< /text>

<Text>This place was absolutely wonderful. We had Phil as our instructor (possibly the owner?) and he was FANTASTIC. Super friendly and really accommodating and had us both standing (and surfing) by the third or fourth wave. I highly recommend for beginners and would absolutely come back to them!! Thank you for the wonderful memories.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>I went to Safari Surf today accompanied by my twin sister, and I have to say the friendly warm, and helpful environment that Marshall and the staff there made my first time surfing in California, very relaxing and enjoyable. We booked a 3pm group surfing lesson and Marshall was very patient and gave us full attention why assisting us in the water. I was even more fortunate as a dolphin swam close to us in a wave to watch me learning how to surf. The Mission beach was beautiful, and the the quality of the surfing lesson was top notch. After an awesome day like that, was made even better when we were offered an extra hour of free surf board or paddle board rental. I highly recommend this local surf shop to anyone looking for good fun in the sun while vacationing in San Diego, CA.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Went here for basic surf lessons. We got Matt as an instructor and he put us in a group of 3. He was kind and did his best to teach us some of the basics. After a quick 20 minute explanation on the beach we got on the water. The waves were pretty high for the day and I would recommend to take the morning lessons as the waves are more calm in the morning.

After and hour and a half Matt told us that we could take the surfboards ourselfs and go for an hour without instructor. Note that 1.5 hour of surf lessons is quite exhausting, and the instructors seemed to agree with that.<//Text><gmapID>0x80dc01e46080e9ab:0xc10a6a89b66dd088<//gmapID><Date>1538558422530< /Date><pics>None<//pics><Rate>4< /Rate>< UserId.>

Good instructor, very personal lesson. Even we booked a group lesson, we got all the attention we needed. However the the staff was not that friendly when we got back. It looked like the wanted to close. But they were open for 2 more ours so we didn't understand the rush.<//review>

At the last minute myself and my kids went for lessons. First time ever surfing, Dave (I think was our instructor) was very easy to listen to and showed us several ways to get on the board. We surfed for an hour and a half and are going back tomorrow. Staff is friendly, helpful and makes an experience of doing something new fun.</text>

I got a private lesson with Dana and it was awesome.  She was hilarious, super helpful - I got up every time except twice, and it was my second lesson.  The staff at the shop was super chill and welcoming - and I pointed me towards the best post surfing spot lunch on the strip! If I'm back in San Diego - I will be back to Surfari Surf School!<//Text>

< Review>
After a very bad experience at a different surf school, I came to Surfari because of its high rating and proximity to my location. I'm very glad I did because I had a great experience with them. Very professional and knowledgeable staff, but a very beachy and relaxed vibe in their store. I had an amazing time and was able to get up on my board pretty quickly thanks to their great instructor staff. I even got to keep my board and wetsuit for an extra hour after my lesson so that I could keep surfing for a while after the instructor was done teaching me. If you're in the Pacific or Mission Beach area, don't waste your time with other surf schools, go to Surfari and have an excellent time.< /Review>

I didn’t do surf school, I just wanted to rent a long board for the day and this place was close and convenient. Their selection wasn’t great- that’s understandable, but the guy at the desk was seriously rude. Like intensely rude.</text>

As the business owner my goal is great customer service and satisfaction. I immediately  called the person you dealt with to get his perspective. He was immediately shocked and is not sure how he came off as intensely rude. He said he spent 20 minutes with you going over our inventory of boards and then even sent you to another shop so you could check out other options. You came back and rented the 8 foot blue and pink soft top. He said when you returned the board you said it worked great. I am not sure if you are aware but he also gave you a discount. If you will, please elaborate on what he did to make you feel like he was rude, so we can fix the problem to avoid negative experiences in the future. We would like to genuinely fix the issue. Thank you for your time.'}<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc01e46080e9ab:0xc10a6a89b66dd088</Gmap_id></record>

<review>I've begun surfing lessons at the Surfari in Newport Beach. Mick and Phil have been very friendly, and informative. I stood up a couple times at the end of my first lesson, and caught lots of waves on my second.

They ask what I'm wanting to work on, and not simply some prearranged schedule. It's great, and I'll keep attending.<//review><Name>Christopher W< /Name><user_id>109014992317285658864<//user_id></record>

The rental guy was cordial at first but after unsuccessfully estimating what size wet suit my wife and I both needed, he became very rude and disrespectful. He had more interest in talking to his friends than actually doing his job. I have never met more inadequate and disrespectful service. The guy outside was very pleasant and helpful (hence the two stars rather than just one). I would highly recommend going to any other place than this. I saw several rental shops for half the price and any service other than this would be better.<//text>

<pics>None<//pics><review>I did the week long surf camp.  It was an experience.... the first day or two I was so sore, and having no luck standing up, I wondered why I thought learning to surf would be fun.  After my muscles got used to being used in that way, I started to enjoy myself.  I never did manage to get all the way up, nor stay on the board for long once I'd tried, but I still had a great time.  Some day I plan to go back, and perhaps one day I'll actually manage to get all the way up and stay there.  I highly recommend Surfari.  All the instructors were very nice, patient, and helpful.</review>< GmapID>

<text>I came here for my 23rd birthday with my boyfriend and I absolutely loved it. We received surfing lessons and it started first on the sand and then we headed to the beach. The instructor was really nice he made me feel very comfortable as I was scared of drowning.   Although, it was one instructor for the both of us he paid attention to us both in the water. At the end of our instruction he actually got the Surf School to allow us to have the boards all day and he even took us to a hotel pool to relax our muscles first and told us of places to go while we were in town! I'd definitely go back!<//text><gmap_id>0x80dc01e46080e9ab:0xc10a6a89b66dd088<//gmap_id>< user_name>

Surfari has become my go-to SUP shop! I always go back to SUP for a couple of reasons -- the prices are reasonable and the staff are friendly and nice. It makes a huge difference as a customer when you know you will be greeted by friendly faces who are eager to help you out. The guys at Surfari are always pleasant and accommodating. Also, they have featured great Groupon/LivingSocial deals and their regular rates are great ($25 for SUP/day). They are in a great location too so you can take the boards to the ocean or to the bay. They always have boards in stock (even on 4th of July!!!) so I know I can count on them. They also offer surf lessons and instruction. I have yet to try the surf lessons but I am sure they're great. I would definitely recommend Surfari to people looking for good SUP or surfing rentals!<//text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Had some friends in from out of town and wanted to do something fun and outdoors, so we all agreed to try some Stand Up Paddleboarding.  We went online to groupon and purchased a couple of 24 hour board rentals for $39.  When we arrived at the Surfari Mission Beach location, we parked across the way at the Santa Clara Point Recreation Center, as there wasn't much street parking on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.  The young men working there were very pleasant and got us our boards very quickly, offering to load them in our car for us.  We opted to carry them across the street, which was a bit ambitious because the boards are quite awkward and heavy!  The check in process was pleasant and very quick.  Filled out some paperwork, showed our Groupon on our smartphone, got fitted for our paddles and on our way.  Upon our return, we dropped off the board and paddles, checked in with the same friendly crew and were on our way again in minutes.

Great time had by all!  Friendly and helpful staff.  Good location near a great bay for boarding and a good parking lot so you don't have to walk too far with all of your beach gear..< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

FrontRunners was so helpful! She got my boyfriend and I fitted of running shoes each with custom inserts. She  was very knowledgeable about different styles of different brands and could teach us about how they might feel while we're running. was sooo patient and efficient. Felt very safe getting fitted during. We had our own section of the store and he FrontRunners.</text>

The guy who eventually appeared was very rude and told me that I only had 4 minutes to buy because they close from 2 to 3! I was going to buy 7 pairs of shoes, that’s more than $1,500 that I will spend somewhere else!

I should have read their reviews before coming here. No wonder why so many people complains! STAY AWAY!<//text>< Pics>

I arrived at this store to pick up some sneakers as I work out quite a bit. I am on my feet all day, and I walk around 4 miles a day at the minimum. There were hardly any people in the store. They said they were too busy to service me. I told them that I would step out and come back. However, they did not even take my phone number down to call me or to text me. The staff should have done this in order to notify me of when they would be ready and available so that I could purchase a good pair of sneakers.< /text>

They scan your feet and pick the perfect shoe for you. No guessing just the best shoe experience you will get for the price.</text>

Love this place! I came in today and marice was suuuuper helpful! I told her what I was looking for and she proactively brought me what I was looking for and tracked down the right sizes and colors quickly and with the sweetest and nicest attitude. A+ for service! :))< /review>

<Review>Came in and was asked by 4 people right off the bat if I needed help (but not in a sales pitchy kind of way like some other stores). This guy helped me out and he was great, spent 30 minutes trying to figure out why I've been having arch problems and he resolved it and gave me really good recommendations. He was so good that my roommate who was with me ask to get a pair and he helped her with the same amount of attention as well. Keep doing you flat feet. Do you.<//Review>< pics>

<review>Renne helped me pick out my first pair of real running shoes. After measuring and evaluating my foot he steered me towards an entry-level pair of New Balance running shoes that fit nicely. I wasn't pushed into something super expensive and I felt like he was focusing primarily on my needs. They have a wide range of running shoe brands, I think this is a great place to shop at.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<user>100868748937678461549</user><Text>I bought new NB Sure-Laces for my NB 990s before my trip to Eastern EU in August. After only 2 wks after returning from my run in Kaunas, Lithuania I noticed the left lace had completely "exploded" into a fluff of hundreds of tiney threads. Never seen anything like and have no idea what could have caused it.
Upon my return home this week, I took the lace to Frontrunners and the guy was going to replace them but had to speak to the Mgr first. The Mgr tells me I have to drive all the way home and bring in the other lace before he could replace it. I asked him if he was serious (wasting all that gas and time for one shoe lace) and he said yes. I paid for the new laces and left NEVER to return again for such stupidity.
I contacted New Balance and they saw the photo of the lace and had no explanation for it BUT sent me a free set of laces to replace them. (They didn't ask me to mail them the laces.)
They need a new Mgr that knows something about customer care.</Text>< Time>

<review>First time here!! Took my dog to give him a bath. It was only $15, which is a few dollars cheaper than other places!! They had 3 tubs, so, didn't have to wait. They provided everything I needed, with a little extras that I've never seen at other places, like hot towels with witch hazel to clean his eyes, ears & face & some cedar oil to spray on him after which helps keep fleas, ticks & insects off him. That was a bonus since I live right by a canyon trail that I walk my dog, Joshua, in. Also, the person working in the store, Kevin, was very helpful, nice & gave my doggie some treats! Very happy!! Will go there again!! They have a club that gives you a free wash after 10 washes, too!! Thanks so much!!< /review>< Pics>

<Review>I love this place. I typically run in and run out because I'm grabbing food for the doge, but this is one of the few places I've seen that has a good selection of raw foods for my dog. I do wish that they're reward system was a little more giving, especially for a frequent customer, but as a small business, I respect that it's tougher to do something like that. Nonetheless, I still give it 5 stars for an awesome selection of toys, healthy foods, and good treats!< /Review><gmapID>0x80d954d4c00fcb09:0x7d6d1eb3a87055a1<//gmapID>< resp>

Great selection of high quality food for pets, as well as accessories (collars, leashes, toys...). The owner and staff clearly care about animals and their welfare. There’s a well equipped pet washing station, I haven’t used it but it clearly has all you’d need to clean your furry pet.</review>

My favorite place to buy my dog's treats and food.  I also got him a vest he wears hiking and he loves seeing it come out of the closet!
Great & friendly staff who are all great at making recommendations and sharing information about the products.</Text>

We love Howlistic! The diy dog wash area has everything you need, just bring your dirty dog, especially after a long morning at the beach. They have convenient hours, friendly staff, easy parking, and high quality food, treats, beds, and toys. I forgot to mention, the frequent wash club. They keep all of the info in their system, so you don't need to remember a punch card:)< /Text>

Convenience is great for me because it is very close to my home. Prices are high though and I believe the higher price is only warranted on products like their"holistic"food but not for things like"poop bags"</Review>

I have been going to Dr. VanSuch for many years now. He and the staff are friendly, warm, and professional.  After many years of going there,  I feel like I’m visiting family when going into the office. But even new clients would get this same reception.  I trust Dr. Van Such who is so thorough with all his testing and follow up care. I love that it’s a family business too.<//text>

Clean environment and very friendly staff. My appointment was at 10:00 a.m. and I was taken right on time, no long waiting period. The whole process was very easy and didn’t take more than an hour. Also my prescription glasses took about 4 days to be ready for pick up, amazing!<//Text>

Everyone was polite and professional. Even to the guy who "didn't believe in masks" and wouldn't wear one. (He wasn't let past the front desk and canceled his appointment)
If you're paranoid about Covid, everything is sterilized with alcohol wipes before you touch them. After you try on display frames, you set them aside and they sterilize them after you've worn 20 pairs.

All the machines taking photos of your eyes took maybe 10 minutes. Exam with the doctor was quick and took around 5. No pupil dilation was involved.</text>

I don't leave reviews for too many places but I'd say if you need to get your eyes checked, I'd definitely recommend here. The front ladies were very helpful, they made sure to go over every little information thoroughly with me first so I felt very comfortable & assured. Dr Joseph was also very friendly as well, he took his time explaining the condition I had and made sure all my questions were answered before I left. Clean place, friendly professional staffs. You won't regret coming here.< /text>

Excellent optical machines to perform a thorough eye examination. All issues are explained in detail with photo's. I chose Dr. Vansuch merely by location, few times you get lucky and find a gem such as this.</review>

Clean friendly place. Cool staff And Doc. Close to Gas station with McDonald's. Two miles off the 55 fwy and Katella. Too long on the wait for the glasses. 2-3 months for Medical insurance. 2-3 weeks(normal) with cash.<//text>

My husband, daughter were able to be seen. Staff is knowledgeable and work with their patients to make sure they have the correct prescription. Very patient, with patients that have a big change in their prescription, make sure they are seeing just right before sending us off.< /text>

I feel like they do a very through exam and that they do a great job on my prescription. They said 2-3 weeks on the glasses but mine came back in two days. Super happy.</text>

< Review>
Dr. Vansuch has been my eye doctor for the last several years, and he truly is great at his craft. Every time I get my vision checked, I know that he and his team will do a comprehensive exam. The office is clean, spacious and offers lots of eyewear options. His staff has always been courteous, professional, very friendly and extremely helpful. I strongly recommend anyone who needs an eye care professional to call Dr. Vansuch's office. Thank you Dr. V, and to your entire team. Cheers</Review>

The doctors are friendly and knowledgeable. The staff is on point and the eye exam was the fastest and most thorough I've ever did. Lots of glasses to choose for reasonable prices,. Sunglasses too. Mayra is amazing for contacts and has helped me finally get contacts. Never going back to the big company I used for years.</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Been going Dr Vansuch since I was 18. 30 plus years. He is the only doctor who was honest enough and told me my daughters medically necessary contacts were covered by insurance. My daughter was being treated by a “pediatrician optometrist” who wanted to charge me over $1200 for her contacts. I took my daughter to see dr Vansuch for a second opinion, he was amazing and informed me my daughter would be covered 100% by insurance. I could not be happier. The whole office is top notch.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I just moved back to the area and was so pleased to see that Dr. Vansuch was still here.  My first appointment back in 10 years was a wonderful experience.  The gals that helped me through my examine were lovely and the Dr. was as kind and personable as I remember.  Highly recommend visiting his office!< /review>

I’ve kept Dr. Van Such and staff as my Optometrist and Optician for over 20 years.  They are competent, kind, and personable.  I introduced my husband to them; he switched from his former Optometrist and sees Dr. Van Such regularly for all the same reasons.< /text>

They were very COVID safe, I went in the morning and I was the only patient there. The woman who helped me pick out frames was so helpful since I was there alone, and they also just texted me that my glasses were ready for pick up after only four days! I would come back here if I ever need more glasses! Great experience< /review>

Dr. Vansuch and staff are very welcoming and make you feel like part of a family. The staff is very detail oriented and ensure you leave with the best knowledge on the latest technology in eyewear and especially contact lenses. The office is spacious and the staff follows the CDC protocols to keep a sanitized environment against Covid. Left happy and lucky to have found this office.</review>

I was able to get an appointment the same day I called as a new patient. The front desk was helpful and Dr. Joe was very friendly and quickly got me in and out. With a large selection of glasses Tom helped me pick out a great pair (even the wife liked) and was able to get them in my hands the next day since my glasses were unusable. I would recommend to any who asks. I am even sending my wife there later this month for her new prescription and glasses.</text>

<Text>I just had my first visit,  the office was very big and welcoming.  Very friendly staff, everyone was very knowledgeable. When it came down to my payment the staff helped me choose the best yet most affordable option.  The office is very modern yet not overwhelming. Mr. V was awesome!!! He was so incredibly nice and when checking my vision he did a double check just to make certain, I didnt feel rushed and I felt like a vip patient. Awesome service and staff!!</Text><gmap_id>0x80dcd742493a3c47:0xa800c05e4f98d5ee< /gmap_id>< rating>

<text>I have been going to Dr. Vansuch for 25+ years. He is always professional, staff is friendly & knowledgeable. Very upfront pricing, no surprises. Never trying to push you into getting something you don't want or need. If he ever decides to retire, I don't know what I'll do for my eye-care needs< /text>< resp>

<Review>Been seen by Dr. Vansuch for over 4 years and every experience has been the best. Entire staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They answer all my silly questions and throughly explain all machines used during the appointment. Dr. V is always a joy to come see, and he makes sure "I" walk out seeing even better then before 😊< /Review>< pictures>

<text>The staff is friendly and provide great service. Wait times are minimal.  They always do a great job examining my eyes and giving me extra care because I have one eye that has 20/100 vision. Nice location. I’ve been going there for over 20 years. Always been fantastic.< /text>< pictures>

Best eye exam experience ever. They were timely, efficient, knowledgeable and extremely friendly.  I was in and out in less than an hour along with my husband.  No pressure to buy anything and straight forward information on what I needed for my vision.

The staff is very professional and friendly. I have been going to Dr. Vansuch for many years and completely trust him with my eye care. I have had some weird things happen to my eyes from a metal shaving in one,  to 5th nerve palsy which caused me to have double vision for 4 months, and I had Bell’s Palsy which kept my eye from blinking, and Dr. Vansuch had me wear a moisturizing contact, which kept my eye moist and kept it comfortable until it was able to blink again. I would not go to any one else!</Review>

I've been going to Dr. Joe for over 40 years, from my first pair of grade school glasses to contacts to Lasik prep and follow up to specialized contacts.  I've always been treated warmly and professionally.  Dr. Vansuch is great about answering questions and working with you to find what is best for you and your eyes.  Highly recommend!<//Review>

I love this family run Business!  I have been going to this office for several years and I have always been able to get a convenient appointment, short wait time, thorough exam, professional staff, and Dr Vansuch will explain any pertinent information that is necessary.  The personnel know their products, listens to your preferences and gladly helps you choose what looks best on you.  Not only do I love this office, I recommended them to my bestfriend.  She and her husband both love this office!<//Text>

<Text>Everyone was friendly from the second we walked in until the second we left. The staff was very patient and accommodating to me and my kids. They were very informative on every test and educated me in everything throughout my exam and my 2 kids. They took time and did not rush the exams. I recommend this office to all friends and family.

<Text>I am so happy to have chosen this office. The staff and the Dr were more than polite and professional. I know my daughter must have given them a hard time while they were trying to run their tests but,  not once did any of them make a face or lose their professionalism while attending to her. Thank you Dr Vansuch and staff for such a wonderful experience while in your office.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I was able to go in for my appointment, at a time that worked best for my schedule. The staff were extremely nice and friendly, keeping me updated on the next part of my appointment. The tech was patient with me when I would blink at the wrong time. I was in and out in about an hour. The staff worked quickly and explained everything me in clear and concise details.

Amazing Dr. !!!!  Amazing Staff!!!  Kind, compassionate, considerate and above all forgiving!!!!  I just adore this place!  I am older and apparently confused. I purchased my glasses 4 years ago with Vansuch Optometric. I called this time for an appointment and showed up. BUT I had called a different place thinking it was Dr. Vansuch. Dr. Vansuch fit me in and took good care of me. While talking to his staff it became clear my error with my appointment. I would recommend this office to anyone looking for glasses and exams. They are clear and upfront with costs. No hidden fees. 10 STARS!!!!!!< /Review>

<Text>As always I had a seamlessly good experience at my annual appointment. Dr. Vansuch was personable and knowledgeable. Both he and the staff answered my questions, and spent a lot of time helping me select my options. They gave me a thorough exam that I feel comfortable with. Fantastic selection of frames! Last year I got the most stylish Christie’s frames from their new line and just love them, and  this year I got prescription sunglasses - also designer at a fair price.  My family has been seeing Dr. Vansuch  for 30 years, and I will continue the tradition!</Text>< Pics>

Great experience! I was able to get an appointment the same day, actually within a few minutes! There were people ahead of me but I didn’t mind, I just walked around and looked at their selection. The staff is so polite and helpful. Dr. Van is very knowledable and personable!! This was my first time here and he made me feel as comfortable as if I was a longterm client. Thank you! I will be back!</Review>

I truly always enjoy my visits to the office of Dr. Joseph Vansuch!  Everyone is so friendly and eager to help take care of you...from the minute you walk in -to the time you leave.!  His office is ahead of the times in having all the up-to-date equipment to test and evaluate your individual eye care needs.    This is really the best optometry office I have ever been to and I would highly recommend it to everyone!!!   I have been going to Dr. Vansuch for many years  now and I always trust his judgement and opinion regarding my eye health.   He and his staff are all very knowledgeable and professional.</text>

Nice people, good service, and you MUST try one of the locally made cookies!

This past Sunday the peanut butter chocolate chunk cookie was heavenly. Combined with a good cup of coffee and a great place to relax after a wonderful bike ride up to the peak of Saddleback makes it all worth while.<//review><Resp>{'time': 1609809092079, 'text': 'Thanks Jack!

<Review>If you go to Silverado for some hiking. Either past the Forestry gate at the end of the canyon or the beginning of the canyon at Black Star you'll want to stop by the market for snacks or a sixpack from their great selection of beer.  The owners are great people.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Great little country Market located in the center of Silverado canyon. It’s an old mining town located just 10 minutes from Irvine or Orange. It’s the only place in OC that feels like you’re out in the country!!! Really cool people working there. Great place to visit and have a home made brownie, YUM!!!< /Text>

Love coming to this lil gem of a place in the heart of Silverado on the weekends. I grab a coffee and snack and sit out front and enjoy the beautiful scenery,  The drive is so nice especially when everything is green and the creeks are flowing!  A kitchen is going in soon so be ready for some legit grub!!</Text>

Best store around! Great for a quick trip or stocking up your pantry! Large selection of goods and alcohol! The staff is so extremely friendly and personable! And the Outpost next door has beautiful handmade and one of a kind gifts!</Text>

Love this little market. If you're in Silverado, you have to stop by. The owners Jeff and Deanna are amazing! They're both just so outgoing and personable. I stop by every single time I'm in the canyon, sometimes just to say hi :p  And I love it when the big guy "Odin' is in :)< /Review>

The Silverado Canyon Store has what you need and then some.

Stop in before your trek up in the hills or to get a frosty beverage before leaving the canyons!</review>

< Review>
It's a very large park with tons of trees and lots of ducks. They also have some very interesting placement of art around the center of the park. It's a very nice place to just sit on a bench relax under a tree or bring your kids over to ride the bikes around the park. I would definitely come here to relax on a Sunday.< /Review>

I liked how it was smooth and since I'ma beginner it was good and how they also had a flat spot. I got better at skating there I learned how to turn and balance more.👌👍😃<//Text>

There wasn’t much to do there, and there were quite a few sketchy people there yelling at each other. Not quite a safe environment for kids.</text>

< review>
This is an example of how to do a great small skatepark.  It's simple, but perfectly designed - a nice snake-ish run with good little street features entering and exiting, a few easy staircases being ripped by locals.  Not intimidating, but still lots of potential to get gnarly.< /review>

<Review>I talked with Steve about a piece of siding that I needed to replace and he helped me figure out exactly what I needed to match it. Then the shipping charges were added up and he knew it was too high for one piece. He instead told me the name of a competitor that is located in my state and had me write down exactly what to tell them so I could get what I needed. This was after spending a big chunk of time with me and not even getting my business because of the unavoidably high shipping cost. I feel kinda bad that I had to go through someone else after all his work. This is a guy that knows what he is talking about and will put the customer first. I was very impressed and thankful for his assistance. (I had read some reviews that the customer service was lacking, which made me nervous to contact them. I think his customer service was great. He isn’t bubbly, but he is an expert and very professional.) I strongly suggest going through Hemet! Thanks!</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Tammy at Hemet Rv is very efficient and knowledgeable,  she has great customer service , I recently e-mailed her  a picture of a panel I needed and I was surprised when I got a phone call back 3 minutes later, she told me exactly which panel it was an that I would have it in a couple of days and sure enough I had the panel in a couple of days.  I was able to finish this trailer in a timely manner for my customer. My customer was happy and in turn I was happy. I highly recommend you talk to Tammi over at Hemet RV,  Thank you again Richard,  Quality Auto body and Paint<//Text>< userid>

<review>We have been purchasing metal siding and sheeting from Steve for 15+ years. Steve is extremely knowledgeable on metal siding patterns and has kept us from buying the wrong metal many times. Keep up the great work Steve.

<review>I have been going here for over a year now. People is a great cook. He makes his chicken burritos and tacos taste good, not bland. The small burrito is huge, two meals for me. Good value for students in the area. Tuesday and Sundays tacos are $1, unbelievable. He located 1 block away from the train. So when you arrive in Chico treat yourself to a family home meal. You feel like you are in Mexico. Viva!< /review></record>

Place was hot, no air conditioner going, was in high 90's outside. Had a dine in order which was bagged up for take out. Salsa bar normally has little plastic cups w/lids for salsa for your order- had to ask for container for salsa. It was 2:30 in the afternoon- lunch rush was done, dinner rush was hours off.<//Text>

Ordered the ASADA super burrito. First off, there wasn't a table or seat that was clean. Second and most importantly, it was ALL rice and beans. I figured I'd open the burrito and hopefully find the ASADA at the bottom or something....nope! Waisted my money. I am seriously disappointed as I was directed here. I sure hope my taco truck comes back! Don't have to be worried about getting a rice and beans burrito.< /review>

< Review>
These are not even close to being decent. I got a tacos de alpastor. Trash. I got a torta de asada and it was more like a sandwich. The carna asada itself wasn’t good and the breas was cold. The agua de horchata tasted like expired milk. Sorry if you guys want good tacos this isn’t it. My quest for good tacos begins in Chico.<//Review>

The customer service was terrible, they got the order wrong and didnt offer to replace the order. I asked for a refund and they refused. The tacos are too salty and too greasy anyways.</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) I ordered two roast tacos without cheese. I got two roast tacos with only cheese and nothing else. At least they were cheap.

Salmon Burrito was ok until I found a long piece of brown hair in it🤮It was March 28 this Sunday,I’ll never go back,don’t wanna risk some one else’s DNA in my food!You can see the hair coming from the black bean and ending up by the foil,unfortunately The other piece of hair was allready in my mouth when I noticed it,hopefully I don’t get sick,you would think the cook or who ever handling the food would wear a hair net,I strongly don’t recommend this taqueria👎🏻< /Review>

Like $15 burritos that are mostly rice? This is the place for you. Do you know how much rice costs? Sad.</Text>

<Text>Ordered pickup and got a text that my order was ready. Went to restaurant and was told my order was not ready. Left and came back. Still no food. Postmates somehow malfunctioned and did not put my name on the ticket but the server kinda made it seem as if it were my bad. It still had the order number though They straightened it out but my food had been sitting for 30 minutes. Could have been handled better with less attitude.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Why people complain about this place I have no clue. It has good service, clean environment and good food for good price. I still feel this place is underrated. Enough with the 3 stars and below please!

This is our neighborhood spot for mexican food. Nuff said. We usually pig out after long hikes around Redwood Regional Park in Oakland or Tilden in Berkeley. After hiking over 8 miles you do get hungry for some burrito you know what I mean? ;)

Between the two of us we shared:
- spicy steak burrito
- 2 veg tamales as side dish

We always share the spicy steak burrito. It's a must try people!!! It's saucy and delicious. Not too light and not too heavy if you share it. Not enough for two people but too much for one so we usually split it and order a side dish like tamales and it works out great. The veg tamales were lovely. We ordered 1 red sauce and green to try. Both were unique and lovely.

Recently people had complained about change in service and ordering so was surprised to find out their service is still great as it used to be. No mess ups no confusion, no lateness. Friendly, fast and efficient.<//Text>

I had a good vegan burrito, except that rice isn't vegetarian, so that was excluded. They don't have any special vegan protien like Soyrizo, "tofu mole", etc. 3 kinds of salsa was nice, pinto beans, guacamole, etc. Respectable size. Was ~$10. I'd come back here again.<//text>

<text>This a nice restaurant, easily viewed from the street if you're driving by.  I had the taco salad with chicken.  It tasted fresh, meaty and the dressing had a very pleasant tang.  The chicken was very good quality, juicy and flavorful.  I also had the horchata and it was light and creamy with lots of cinnamon.  I noticed that they have beer choices in bottles and they have a children's menu.  I think I spied some high chairs as well.  I dined al fresco as it was a gorgeous day in Oakland and lake Merritt was looking especially fetching.  Parking is on the street but don't let that deter you.  It seems fairly easy and plentiful.  A very nice, no frills, local Mexican place with good food and fast service.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDGi0lpRJuC-Xf_BpyWBn2XrF8Fm2m0gc8VmcM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN57EaJ7jDID1h1XNQlPDzE0p5hH7b90hd5NByh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQtqNCcF_k-UKxXAeDotqQHSb-EZWn8KrUKvXZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Date>1479914139574<//Date><Name>Jennifer Collins</Name><gmap_id>0x808f874f1bc0069b:0x55923c2cbce71aa2</gmap_id>< response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I’ve been coming here for two years, since I relocated to Oakland. I love the food and the margaritas are great! My family loves the burritos; I’m a carnivore they eat veggie or shrimp -take out and dine in - all are delicious. There’s also a small bar & sports TVs. It’s a great neighborhood spot for family and friends & I recommend it!<//text>< userid>

<Text>The food is mediocre and overpriced. The only thing consistent here is that they will mess up your order then try to convince you that you ordered whatever they served you. The management is the worst you will find. Unfortunately my kids like it and it’s the only neighborhood Mexican joint. I don’t understand the good reviews here. This place is 2 stars at best.<//Text>< Pics>

Ordered 3 chicken tacos, with only meat, beans, cheese, and sour cream, and one bottle of Pacifico, and got a bill for $36.00!
Food wasn't really hot, but rather warm, which became cold quick. And worst of all, except for the sour cream, the tacos were pretty blan in taste.<//Text>

Red sauce on the enchiladas was excellent. Menu was reasonably priced though some items such as the Nachos seemed a little expensive. Service was mostly good, and the food arrived fast.< /text>

<text>I have been coming here for 14 years. It was sold to a new ownership group several years ago and the food for the most part stayed the same, of course prices went up. While some other items are really good, some of them are not so good. Their soups have always been one of the reasons I continue to come here. However, I find it difficult to understand how a place that serves huge bowls of soup, serves them with teaspoons. Have the owners tried to eat a bowl  of their soups with a teaspoon? This has been an ongoing issue and I would have thought they would have figured it out by now. I just asked employees if they had any bigger spoons other than a teaspoon and they searched frantically and could not find anything. Seems like a very simple fix but perhaps ownership is too busy with other things than to focus on instead details like having soup spoons for for large bowls of soup? As petty as this review may sound it's pretty important to people that come here for the soups. Would love to give this place 4 or 5 stars but it's just so lame everything must be eaten from of teaspoons< /text>< Pictures>

The corn tamales were absolutely delicious with their green tomatillo sauce. Big portion .
Mind you the rice is made in chicken broth,  but the staff will let you know its not vegetarian. Vegan options available too.<//Text>

<Text>Los Cantaros has good food. It's cute on the inside and a great place to bring friends to eat. What I'm not sure about is what they're going for-- for awhile Los Cantaros was a really great quick / carry-out kind of place. They've recently transitioned to something ... in between? Not sure how to describe it, but it's somewhere between sit-down dining and order-at-the-counter... with a big bar and TV that's always playing sports.

Biggest knock: a bit pricey for what it is. Love the food but a super burrito for $13 is astronomical, even for (or maybe especially for) the Bay 🤷‍♂️<//Text>< date>

During my lunch break, I spent my money and time to be giving average service here. My burrito was expensive and no salsa was added. I re-entered the establishment to get one tiny cup of salsa for a super burrito. I’ll never visit this Taqueria again. The waiter and hostess are not naturally nice. And I tipped when I paid my bill, so I was definitely unsatisfied.< /Text>

<review>Good portions for reasonable prices—got a large lunch for three people, including a pitcher of fairly strong margaritas, for about $22 each (before tip). Nice location near Lake Merritt. The spicy burrito was big and spicy enough for those who like it hot.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Date>1523443098872<//Date>< Rating>

This place has the dubious honor of being both the most I’ve paid ($14) and the longest I’ve waited (~50 mins.) for a burrito in the bay area. Never again.< /Text>

<review>My favorite go-to Mexican restaurant! The food is yummy and service is nice. I recommend the burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas and chicken soup. The only thing is,  the food can take awhile to come out and they only have 1 salsa! It's a good spicy salsa but I like variety.< /review>< user_name>

<Text>I legit drive from Antioch just to get food from here. They are very friendly, prompt and professional. They offer a great selection of both food and drinks, this includes alcohol. They offer vegetarian options as well. Their house sangria is great. They speak both English and Spanish for those that care. You can eat either in, or out side. The location is adjacent to Lake Merritt.</Text><user_name>Christina Her<//user_name>< Time>

<rate>4<//rate><text>Ok first off, the food and drinks are fantastic. Almost as good as you can find in Texas. However, service is AWFUL. So so so slow. Have to flag down the waitress to even get your drink order going. Currently waiting 10+ minutes for them to pick up our check. The first time i was here I waited 20 min to order before walking out. Would come here all the time, they're literally down the hill from me, except that service is so bad.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

The good food is more then decent - borderline deliciousness, but we'll worth the price. Cold beer, too. Best Mexican in the area for sure.<//Review>

I've been coming to here for a few years now.  The Street Taco platter is excellent.  They recently opened up the bar and serve up a decent margarita.  Though the agave wine margarita they used to serve was also tasty.</review>

<Review>The food is great. We especially enjoyed the tomales and burritos. The service is also quite good. What the place lacks is ambiance. You can have a sit-down experience or order at the counter, but you may feel a little confused about which you are about to do, and the paper menus feel as if they are about to fall apart.< /Review><user_name>Nathaniel Jones</user_name>< Resp>

Great prices, good healthy food, but the dishes seem to lack in flavor where they gain in healthy quality.  I would guess that they aren't using the traditional lard that many authentic Mexican restaurants use in most of their entrees. It's not bad, just sort of a watered down version of the delicious Mexican food I grew up clogging my little arteries with.</text>

Slowest service in the world. There are two cash registers and the cashiers get the drinks. They should hire more employees. Cannot even handle a small rush. Very good food though I must admit. Friendly service too.</Text>

It's really annoying paying $11 for a super burrito. What was once the food of the campesinos is now just another kick in the working man's empty belly.  I don't blame the restaurant for charging so much, rather,I blame the fools who are happy to pay it. False bubble economy leeches. In all fairness,the burrito was good. Maybe I'm wrong but I think the frijoles refritos are homemade. They tasted really good.</review>

<Review>Not what it used to be. The staff is indifferent at best and seem kind of tense, "thank you " seems to have been lost from their vocabulary, and the food has gone to mediocre, at least the last two times I was there. Tonight I got through half a super burrito and still didn't find the sour cream and precious little guacamole. I'll give it one more shot and then go elsewhere.< /Review><response>None< /response><pictures>None<//pictures><user>103491981140628776847</user>< username>

This is a good place to satisfy your evening craving for some tacos. It doesn't take long to get your food and everything is reasonably priced. I found the meat to be a touch on the tough side, but the overall flavor was ok. The salsa is on point.</text>

Food was good, clean place, okay drinks, service was okay, maybe my party and I seem cheap because she kept giving us the prices.  Her service for us was missing enthusiasm and parking was a bit of a struggle.< /Review>

I got the meatless burrito.  Strange thing is, I didn't order the vegetarian burrito, I ordered the carne asada super burrito. Well, there was no super, nor carne, nor asada. This place clearly caters to the transplant gringos from the midwest. Pass on this one!<//Text>

<Review>Los Cantaros has excellent food and can usually get our large group seated quickly. The experience will depend a lot on which server you get and how busy the place is. One star off because the bathrooms are in terrible shape.<//Review>< pics>

Delicious and convenient! Changes to the layout of the interior (new to me) yield a cozier atmosphere.</Text>

This place is much better than the Los Cantaros in Emeryville. The food is more authentic, the atmosphere is brighter, they have a full bar, and it's right by the lake, so you can get your food to go if you want to eat outside and watch the waterfowl do their thing.< /text>

<Review>I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?

Yesterday, and days before,
Sun is cold and rain is hard,
I know;
Been that way for all my time.
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow,
I know;
It can't stop, I wonder.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

From tacos, burritos, and nachos, they haven't failed me yet. Free salsa and chips (not self serve), and they serve a variety of drinks from the bottle and frescas. A spot to check out if you're in the area.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

We paid roughly 30 dollar for a carne asada burrito and a taco salad. When we got home to eat, I found that my burrito was more like a veggie burrito. There were perhaps 3 or 4 tiny pieces of meat sprinkled inside. When i walked back to the store to ask for a refund and show them the remainder of the food. They refused to refund this one item. It's their loss..<//review></record></dataset><record>

Blick. Poor service, food was bland, hurried prep and unremarkable. Margarita was good, but rest was subpar. Skip this place.< /text>

I give this restaurant a solid 3 stars. The food is okay, not great, the prices aren't bad, the location is meh, the service is not great....the cleanliness leaves something to be desired. I honestly dint go here much anymore, it seems to have gone downhill from a few years back. The burritos ate skimpy on the meat, the guacamole is always off, chips are hit or miss, but really the service and cleanliness are a big thumbs down.
One positive, the caldo tilapeno is paleo and really filling. :)</text>

They are the sole Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood - so they have a monopoly on this flavor. Been coming here for years when there was a Korean(?) contingent running the kitchen and ordering. Since they've left wait times for food are awful, quality has dropped and this is hardly the best Mexican restaurant outside of Fruitvale - if you live in the area you would find La Catarina food truck on Broadway/29th. Go there coz that's where the Latino folk outside of Fruitvale go.< /text>

<Review>Cheap but quality burritos. Seems a bit understaffed with slow service and hard to get a hold of for togo orders. It's hard to order ahead by phone (will ring busy for a while) or online (websites like GrubHub say it's closed when it's open).<//Review><Time>1612586738880<//Time><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

< Review>
18.57 for a 'spicy' burrito and medium horchata, it was mostly beans and rice and sauce maybe a ounce of steak and when she rung it all up i brought it up she just shrugged her shoulders and almost charged for a large drink, very unsatisfied almost 20$ for something i couldve got from a drive through</Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The worst burrito in al pastor, I ordered a super burrito, they didn't even add cream, cheese or guacamole. They gave him a meal of meat, but they topped him with beans and rice. If you are going to sell food with meat, throw it in with enthusiasm even if it costs more, if not better sell vegetarian food.

(Original)
El peor burrito de al pastor, pedí un burrito súper, ni siquiera le echaron crema, queso o guacamole. Le echaron una mentada de carne pero si lo retacaron de frijoles y arroz. Si van a vender comida con carne, échenle con ganas aunque cueste más , si no mejor vendan comida vegetariana.< /Text><Date>1622415794494< /Date><Name>Andrey Ruiz<//Name></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Everyone's reviews are according to their experiences, mine was very bad, the table was reeling because it was uneven and all the water spilled, the food is not very good and the place is not very hygienic, the only thing that I am sastifecha the service is very friendly and the waiters are quick. But it will be one of the restaurants I will not return to.

(Original)
Los reseñas de cada quien es conforme a sus experiencias, la mía fue muy mala, la mesa estaba tambaleando por que estaba dispareja y se derramó toda el agua, la comida no es muy buena y el lugar no es muy higiénico, de lo único que estoy sastifecha es del servicio los meseros muy amables y atiende rápido. Pero será uno de los restaurante a los que no regresaré.<//text>

I had never been to a restaurant where what you ask for doesn't have. I'm living in the city for work. The two days I attended the restaurant I asked for different dishes and they told me that you didn't have the rocking chairs, you see that you don't have any experience. In both ovations they forgot the food of one of my colleagues, I see that they work without any guide, nobody gave us the face to apologize or an explanation of the bad service I have seen bad service but like this nooo.
I do not recommend this restaurant I hope its owner takes action if you want your business to move forward.

Pd .. quick to charge.

(Original)
Pésimo servicio . Nunca había ido a un restaurante donde lo que pidas no tienen . Estoy de vivita en la ciudad por trabajo .  Los dos Días que asistí a restaurante pedí diferentes platillos y me dijeron que no tenías los meceros se ve que no tienene  nada de experiencia . En las dos ovaciones se les olvidó la comida de uno de mis compañeros , veo que trabajan sin ninguna guía , nadie nos dio la cara para pedir disculpas ni una explicación del mal servicio eh visto mal servicio pero como este  nooo.
No recomiendo este restaurante espero su propietario tome acciones si desea que su negocio siga adelante ..

Pd .. rápidos para cobrar .< /review>< pictures>
