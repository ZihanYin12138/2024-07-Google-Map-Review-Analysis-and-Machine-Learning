Its nice and quiet and they keep the place well maintained. The maintenance staff does a great job. Marco has been doing a wonderful job fixing the issues in my apartment. He is always very professional, respectful and resolves the issues quick and effective. The office staff on the other hand could use some work on communication. I have had some bad experiences with them, specially Christina, she can be rude at times. For someone that has the position of assistant manager I would expect a little more manners and better customer service. The parking is bad, most of the time there is no parking spaces available, since there's only one assigned per apartment. Overall I think its not so bad living here. Its close to alot of grocery stores and other stores which I find convenient.<//review>< time>

This review mainly goes to the maintenance department, most importantly the manager of the maintenance team : Marco. He is really great. He never says no when you need something and he’s always there. He really does go above and beyond and makes sure everything was done and fixed if he’s not the one doing the fixing. Meadowwood really needs to take care of him cause he really does make a great asset to the team!<//Text>

<Review>I’ve lived here for a month currently, and I’m fairly pleased with my experience so far. A little bit of a bumpy move-in, some things were unfinished or in need of repair, but what the complex/units lack, the staff make up for.

Christina and Riley in the office are consistently helpful and communicative, and Marco from maintenance is exceptional—he’s handled all my maintenance requests promptly, smoothly, and professionally.

The units themselves are certainly essentials only with no frills, and have...let’s call it character. They’re definitely adequate, but if you value pristine living conditions that don’t feel a little lived in when you move in, that’s not exactly this complex’s strong suit.

Parking is a bit of a nightmare (In an apartment complex?? What a surprise!), but it’s a good location (right off the 118) with a lot of grocery stores, restaurants, and hiking within just a few minutes.

Plus, all recurring payments to the complex can be put on autopay through their app, which is a huge stress reliever for someone (read: me) who has a very selective (read: terrible) memory.

TL;DR — move here for the staff and location, not the units.</Review>< Pictures>

< review>
We moved to this community exactly two months ago and every aspect of our experience has been pleasant and friendly. The staff at the leasing office is welcoming and understanding, even when I had to bring up an uncomfortable issue during the leasing process that ended up being just a small misunderstanding. Neither the office manager nor the office staff lost their professionalism and were able to explain the situation to us in a friendly way. Rachel helped us with our lease, paperwork, and all aspects of our moving experience. She demonstrated professionalism at its best, all the time. Rachel is a valuable asset for Essex and she is key to many of our excellent reviews! Rachel is very kind, understanding, and knowledgeable in her field. After living here for two months I can say it's a very quiet place, well taken care of, and they have an amazing custodial staff that takes almost no time in fixing anything that may be needed. Honestly, we have not found anything wrong with living here. Some of the inconveniences that the parking has, as mentioned by some of the reviews, is nothing compared with the quality of service and living in a nice and clean community. Although parking has never been an issue for us because we always find parking, we are so grateful we don't have to park outside a very busy street or unsafe neighborhood like the one where we moved from. Compared to the other side of the mountain, parking at Meadowood Apartments is heavenly! :) To put the icing on the cake, just this afternoon, I received a call from Christina asking how my husband and I were doing during these troubling times. I was surprised and grateful at the same time. No one, in any of the places I have lived before, had ever taken the time to call us and check in on us. Not even when we faced earthquakes! Thank you Meadowood Apartments, we are very happy tenants and we are grateful for the opportunity to live here.<//review>

Do not apply for indian oaks apartments they have a leasing agent thats on drugs and they will mess your paper work up and take your aplication fees and deny you . Stick with meadowood apt.

We lived at Meadowood for almost 4 years and had a generally positive experience, except for one stabbing incident outside our apartment with police involved, lack of parking, and the many times our vehicle had been ran into, non of which is entirely in their control. Then came time to move out.

We purchased a house 2 months before the end of our lease.  We paid the early termination fee as per the lease (which they would not budge on with the lease ending in 2 months and the apartments listing for $200 more than what we were paying) which is fine, its in the lease.

What we did not anticipate were all the added charges on move out and that they would forward me a bill.  The apartment was immaculate, however we were still charged 140 for cleaning. They claimed that the sink needed relaminated, which had damage the entire time of our stay.  They charged us 1 year and 2 months of carpet wear, which was not new when we moved in.  When I called to inquire, they stated they had a showing and would call me back.  They hung up and never returned my calls.  My wife dropped off the check and said that the staff was rude to her as they took the check from her and walked off.

Based on our move out experience I would not recommend Meadowood.</review>

I lived at this complex for almost 5 years... and I’ve lived in apartment complex my whole adult life. When I moved out of this place I expected a cleaning fee because I had to move very quick and had no time to deep clean, and I expected  a carpet fee of a small percent because I lived there for so long with pets, and they would replace it.
But never have I ever been charged for updates for the kitchen counters after almost 5 years. There were no chips, no missing parts, no deep scratches, only normal wear and tear you would expect after almost 5 years, and they decide to do an upgrade after that long and what happens?..  I get charged about $400.00 for and upgrade... along with being charged for bathtubs that were old and nasty when I first moved in. The bathroom paint had human hairs stuck in the paint from the previous renters, and the bathtubs were not sealed, and chipped away.
Regardless, I told the lady at the time during the walk through what I saw, and in the end I was still charged.
Don’t ever live here unless you’re prepared for your security deposit plus $500+ Once you move out even if it was normal apartment “wear and tear” and regardless of you let them know in your walk through... you’ll still be charged.</text>

Lived here almost a year and the staff is friendly and helpful. The only thing keeping me from a 5 star is the gym is not open 24 hours which is a big inconvenience. I work early hours and would like to workout earlier then the gym hours allow. Last time I workout 5 minutes to closing time a security guard said we had to leave even though we only would be over 5 minutes after closing. I don't understand why other apartments have 24 access to gym but they don't, if you have night security then they can monitor activity in gym throughout the night. Or open gym earlier then posted time. Also I'm very disappointed that my apartment couldn't have the new upgrades that alot of other apartments have. We didn't get stainless steel refrigerators or nice countertops. I feel like I got short end of stick. I wouldn't mind short period of construction if I get upgrads like that. Just getting a fouchet or water heater adapter upgrade isn't fair. Especially since we are paying the same amount for rent.</text>

I have been living at Meadowood for just over 9 months. I have not had any problems. Things that needed repair in my apartment were fixed and the office staff has always been very helpful. My lease year is coming up in November. If they would let me renew today I would sign it right away.</Review>

1. Security issues: Be carefull yesterday i removed my NIke Shoes($70 worth) outside my partment and went to the park and check email and when back in 20 minutes and observe shoes was not there.
There should be some security officer in the society should watch people roaming around.
2.Price is too much they should not increase the rent every year.i live in 2 bedroom price is around $1800 which is not worth..so if they reduce the rent or just not increase then i would say this is the best place to live rest all is good<//review>

They're maintenance is fast like other large apartment but that is it. First, parking is nightmare. Not enough open parking spaces so people park at nearby shopping center. They don't enforce even their own rule. I have a newborn and can't leave a window open due to too many smokers. Watch out for little crazy kids playing around your car and scratching it. I don't have any bug or rat problem but there are pest problems apartment in front of us. Too many people feeding wildlife. People leave food for rats, cats, and squirrels. Look down as you walk because people don't clean up after their dog. The thing that bugs me the most is smokers. Here people smoke 24/7. Even at 3 or 4 am. I would not recommend this place.< /review>

<Date>1616373511896<//Date><text>It was definitely time for a new mattress since ours was 10 years old. We decided to come into sit n sleep on a Saturday morning. We honestly expected to be out all day, going to different stores, and becoming frustrated, since this seems to be the usual experience for us when shopping for furniture.

We walked into the store and were immediately greeted by Marcus. He spoke with us about what we were looking for and began to show us a few mattresses. We were able to find the perfect mattress for our needs, which was a Nectar mattress. Their price was the same as it was on the Nectar website. It also came with the extras that Nectar advertises, which is 2 pillows, a sheet set, and a mattress protector.

We decided on the mattress we liked and made the purchase. We were probably in the store for only about 10 minutes and we were shocked and how well everything went and how easy it was. Marcus arranged delivery for the next day, and we received our mattress this morning on a Sunday. They also hauled away our old mattress.

This was such a surprisingly easy transaction and my husband and I were so pleased with the purchase. Sit n sleep also has a 1 year return, so we had nothing to lose. If we don't like the mattress, we can exchange it for another one. I really like this and will continue to be a customer here as long as the service remains this awesome.< /text>< GmapID>

<text>My little family visited Sit N Sleep and were greeted by Marcus who helped us navigate the large selection of mattresses. We didn't know what we were looking for... at ALL. But thanks to Marcus, he was very knowledgable about all the different options and explained the difference between all of them. He put together a great deal for us and had it delivered for us! We are SUPER happy with our purchase and experience at Sit N Sleep.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

<review>We stopped in to browse mattresses and left with a great purchase. Marcus Montgomery was extremely helpful, he helped both my wife and I choose the right mattress for us. He answers all our questions and assured us of everything we were purchasing was correct. We are very happy to have met Marcus, now just looking forward to receiving our items.

This was a convenient location for this small, clean store. Marcus, our super friendly and helpful staff guy, led us through a computer analysis that narrowed down the best type of mattress for us. From there, it only took 3 tries to get the right mattress! The price was about what we expected to pay AND it came with 2 cool pillows and a set of sheets. With the delivery on a day that was convenient for us, as well as the warranty (all included in our price), this was one of the best experiences I’ve had getting a bed.</Text>

We initially went in to browse and get an idea of what was available, but we tried out the mattresses that were recommended for us by their machine and we found a perfect one that was comfortable and within our budget. Marcus was extremely helpful and informative. We are pleased with our experience and I would recommend this store for your next mattress purchase.< /text>< Pics>

I’ve been to many mattress stores but the one in Burbank was the best because of the sales person, Roderick. He was very professional and answered all of my questions. What I lived about the sales person was he wasn’t trying to just sale it, he wanted to make sure it was what I really liked and tried to get me the best deal as possible. He was very patient with me since I do tend to change my mind a lot. He was able to find me a great mattress within my price range and I couldn’t be more thankful.</Text>

Just had fantastic service at the Burbank Sit ‘n sleep. Fast, informative. You get a computerized analysis of what you need in a mattress and then try can try out different ones. I learnt so much (especially compared to when I bought my last one 15 years ago.) Ask for Marcus. He’s straight to the point, friendly and I appreciate good salesmanship! He has it!</Text>

Had a wonderful experience picking out my mattress. I told Marcus my needs and he steered me in the right direction to the perfect mattress. Sadly the mattress I wanted was not going to be available until March so he arranged a temporary one to be sent to my house until the one I chose could be fulfilled. Thanks Marcus. You really helped me out.<//text>

Was in the market for a mattress and decided to visit sit 'and sleep. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by Marcus at the Burbank location. He told me he was going to be with me in a moment.  As we waited for him to finish, an other customer he was attending told us " your gonna love this guy, he's great" Waited for about 5 minutes and WOW. He was so informative,  understood our every need and walked out of there with a new bed with in 30 min. Best experience and customer service I've had. Thanks Marcus.  We'll definitely be doing business in the future.< /text>

<Review>JAVIER was AWESOME!!! This guy got me a GREAT deal and saved me an arm and a leg 💪🏼🦵🏼👌🏼(I mentioned I was budget conscious).
My wife and I didn't have to do much searching after about 3 different beds, and luckily by the third bed, we decided we would settle on the bed we slept on last 🙌🏼✨
So after we decided on which baby maker we'd be taking home, Javier took care of us and reassured that my lower back would be thanking me very soon (he said I'd be doing cartwheels before I knew it, and that world peace would ensue shortly after... I'd never see the world the same again and the bed in box idea would slowly but surely be erased my now relaxed mind ✨👍🏼)
So I want to write the last out of this out to say a big, fat "thank you" to the awesome, friendly and extremely helpful guy known as Javier who helped us and for saving my back in the process as well as stopping world hunger.
Couldn't have done any of it without him!! 👌🏼😃<//Review>< user_name>

What an amazing "buying a bed" experience. I had bed bugs from my old mattress and had to get a new one. I had a temper-pedic, so I was looking for something less expensive, but with a similar feel. Karen was amazing! She ended up putting together a great package for me, with all the bed bug encasement parts as well as a beautiful bed frame. I would highly recommend this store, as they want to make YOU happy and even give  you a 30 day warranty. I love my bed so much, feels better than a temper!a If you wanna make an investment in a new one, ask for Karen at the La Brea store!< /Text>

I recently had a severe accident at work where I broke my right leg and ankle and hurt my back and needed a new bed. I went into the Sit n Sleep in Burbabk and was help by a wonderful  sales person named Marcus Montgomery. He was very patient with me and helped me pick out the perfect mattress with an elevating base board and pillows he was able to get me a great deal which really helped because I am still on disability. I would highly recommend this store and Marcus. Thank you Sit n Sleep. For my heavenly night sleep.<//Text>

Vicki in Burbank was great! Very patient and knowledgeable. She took the time to help me find the right fit for me and never pressured me about anything. I spent almost 2 hrs trying out mattresses and ended up getting the perfect match. Also, the “scientific” machine that fits you was also on point. I tried all the different color/firmness options just to make sure, but the science didn’t lie. Overall, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend stopping in if you’re looking for a new mattress.<//review>

Had a great shopping experience and was able to finally purchase my box spring (with drawers on the sides...that calls for a YAAY!) and much need pillows.

We are very pleased with the service we received from Sit n Sleep. Marcus at the Burbank location helped us pick out the right mattress and base and was very informative and kind. He helped us answer all of our questions as well. We looked around at other stores that were too expensive and honestly, we don't think any other store was able to beat the prices we got here. The delivery was prompt too and they even set up the bed for us. We definitely recommend Sit n Sleep for anyone who's in need 👍<//text>

We needed to get the right mattress to help my wife sleep comfortably.  Vicki of Sit”n Sleep, Burbank, CA, helped us by recommending several different mattresses to try and assessing each try and recommending more suitable ones to try.  After deciding on one, she recommended we return another day to retry the mattress just to be sure as well as pointed out potential savings from sales.

Even more amazing, when we returned to buy the mattress, she honored the mislabelled price we originally saw.  Vicki also recommended a protective cover because we were initially going place the mattress directly on the floor.

We feel we really benefitted from Vicki’s knowledge of the products she sells.  Also, Vicki never pressured us into purchasing despite all the time she spent serving us.<//text>

<rate>3<//rate><Text>I just purchased a mattress and adjustable frame.This store has good selection of mattresses and other options. Marcus was knowledgeable about the products in store. However, their computer system was cery slow and I wasn’t able to bring with me a receipt of purchase but was emailed the next day. I was promised to receive a call the next day for time window for delivery, which never happened. The delivery guys called me same day as they were 7 minutes away from my house. This shows no followup and courtesy for customers. Delivery guys came in without gloves or shoe covers ( which is very relevant during this Covid-19 pandemic), left their mess in the house. They were not given instructions how to handle this delivery properly. We paid good amount of money in store for good products, but messed up the experience during delivery. Please instruct your delivery people, to wear gloves, shoe cover especially going inside houses most especially if floors are carpeted. Wearing gloves, shoe cover has same purpose as wearing masks most importanly during this pandemic.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<review>Vicki was absolutely amazing! She took so much time helping me and my husband find a bed that suited both of us - not an easy thing to do. She never became impatient or rude. She was just super helpful, and all around pleasant. The prices were very fair, even better than the other stores we visited. Highly recommend Sit 'N Sleep!< /review>< pictures>

Sales associate Vikki worked with me and she was very helpful, she had a lot of information and made sure I took a very long time deciding on just the correct mattress. I didn’t realize that time was so important and after she explained why I was able to pick out just the right mattress. I will definitely recommend her and Burbank Sit and Sleep.<//review>

We enjoyed the experience of being served by Vicky and Marcus and now look forward to enjoying the mattress

Went in today on a mission for a specific bed that I heard about and was greeted by Vicki Rogers. She was welcoming, warm and helpful! She listened to what me and my husband were looking for and was so knowledgeable on everything! She made purchasing our dream bed a comfortable, fun and easy experience instead of scary! We have no buyers remorse whatsoever!! :) Can't wait for the delivery!!</Text>

My Fiance and I went into Sit n Sleep in Burbank a week ago just to browse for a mattress. We were curious about the different types of mattresses and above all prices. Being on a wedding-planning budget was a big factor but we knew that a mattress is an investment regardless. Vicki the store-manager greeted us and set us up with a computer system that finds the pressure points of our sleeping positions to help us find the best mattress. Then we tried several mattresses. She was and is incredibly knowledgeable about different mattresses and very patient when it came to my questions. She spent a good 40 minutes with us and we felt awful but we weren’t ready to make a decision even after finding the mattress we loved. We went to browse and didn’t want to make any hasty decisions. She could not be nicer about it. She gave us her card along with helpful information and we we left. I called her during the week with a random question and, again, she was very nice. We couldn’t stop thinking about the mattress all week it was exactly what we were looking for. We did go to other places but it is true what they say “They’ll beat anyone’s advertised price” and that includes Amazon which was more expensive. I know right?!? So we returned today and we bought the mattress and we could not be more excited. It’s reassuring to know that after the hectic wedding planning and crazy wedding day we’ll have an incredibly comfortable mattress that suits our needs thanks to Vicki.< /review>

We spent 2 1/2 hours in the store making sure we chose the right mattress for us.

<review>Very nice store. The staff is very professional. No pressure. No hard sell which is what I like. Just let me take my time, test out all the beds, explained the difference in mattresses. Ended up buying a mattresses and a bed and they even got it delivered the same day (with a fee) but I was new to Burbank and needed something to sleep on ASAP. The whole experience was great.

Bought a discontinued floor model at a smoking good price. Robin was able to give a bundle deal plus a returning customer discount. You can tell he has lots of experience and did a great  job keeping me engaged while answering all my questions.

< review>
We'd had a long day of exhausting bed/mattress shopping when we stumbled into the Sit and Sleep. Right from the start, our experience was superior. All day we'd dealt with pushy salespeople who were spouting rehearsed spiels. At Sit and Sleep, Vicky instead asked US what we were looking for, and really listened. She moved at a comfortable pace for us, and let us explore many options in price, style, and comfort. We had full confidence that our product would be top quality, and it has not dissapointed. Delivery was free, quick, and easy. Thanks for helping us get comfortable rest and for being genuine!< /review>

Robin helped with us walk through finding a mattress.  He let us take our time instead on buying buying and leaving.  This is pretty much why we bought here,  he stayed past closing to finish our sale.  Thanks Robin!<//Review>

<review>Vicki was amazing! She was very knowledgeable about the mattresses and did not pressure us at all when buying. We even checked out a couple other stores in the area, and then returned to Sit & Sleep and to Vicki and made our purchase. All n all, it was a very pleasent experience and we will be sure to recommend Vicki and Sit &a Sleep to friends and family.
A big thank you, from Shaun and Michele!<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>My experience working with Victoria at Sit N Sleep in Burbank was wonderful. She answered all my questions and really helped me find the right mattress for me, while at the same time giving me the space needed to confirm the right choice. She did not rush me at all, and did not push me toward more expensive mattresses or options. She really was interested in getting me the right mattress for me. I also loved that she is a cat person and therefore had firsthand knowledge of all the nuances that go into mattress buying related to animal co-sleepers lol.<//Text><Response>{'time': 1520352369413, 'text': "Hi Eden - Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful review.

Worst customer service my wife and I have ever had. I didn't get the salesman's name because when he found out how much we wanted to spend he blew us off and went to help someone else. My wife and I ended up leaving as did  another couple. We went to a different store and purchased our mattress there. Would never recommend this store.< /Review>

Initial shop last week with Brian; purchase today with Robin; very happy customer tonight!  Very broad selection of all sleep items (frames, mattresses, protectors, linens); wide spectrum of quality and price; low pressure sales approach with lots of helpful info but no pressure; knowledgeable and caring staff; quick delivery available; simply an EXCELLENT total experience!</text>

<text>I had heard a lot of bad things about the mattress people. But, Allan was great. He asked a lot of questions, and led me to lay on almost a dozen mattresses, while asking what was good or bad. No rushing at all. The selection there at The Sit N Sleep in Burbank was astounding.

It was great price, a great bed, and WELL worth the time and the little amount of money I spent for a great bed. I am sending ALL my friends there.< /text>< pics>

We purchased a Temperpedic Bed from Brian at Sit and Sleep today.  In searching for the right bed we had also visited another mattress store we had purchased from in the past in the Ventura area.  Brian was so helpful in helping us understand the variations in the models of the mattresses we were interested in.  He was knowledgeable, extremely patient and answered all the silly questions we had.  Not only did we purchase the mattress but upgraded to an adjustable motorized base because of the information that he supplied.  He took the time, and showed the interest to help us understand what would best serve our needs.  And while he was very busy, he managed to take the time that was needed to address or needs.  Thank you Brian< /Review>

BRIAN IN BURBANK ROCKS! We were in the market for a Tempur-Pedic & did a little online research as well as in-store pricing. We knew we would visit a Sit n Sleep & located the one closest to our in-store research. We also knew we were going to make a financial investment in our future sleep-filled nights. When we entered into SnS on S.San Fernando in Burbank on July 3rd, Brian was there wrapping up a sale (as luck would have it) with another couple who were purchasing a Tempur-Pedic. This couple had researched for 6 months & shared their knowledge with us. 30 minutes later, we walked out - contract in hand & a brand new Tempur-Pedic (& all the bells, whistles, pillows & bedding) set for delivery. Brian was awesome. He was patient, kind & very VERY knowledgable. If you're in the market for a mattress, we cannot recommend Brian at Sit n Sleep Burbank, enough. Larry is great for the advertising, no doubt... But Brian is tops in Guest Service & product knowledge. Thank you, Brian! See you in 10 years!! - Sheryl & Denny, Lake Balboa, CA<//review>

<review>Matt was Great in explaining the variety of mattresses for our daughter's bed. He never once sugessted to go for the  the higher prices but rather the best fit for an 8 years old. We will definitley go back for our second set for ourselves because as a smart shoppper, they definitley have great prices and styles for all comforts.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<rate>5<//rate><text>This is a small military exchange mini-mart.  It's located on the Navy base so of course only government personnel and dependents will be able to access it.  It's nice if you're staying in lodging because there isn't anything else close by unless you drive.  Think of it as a 7 Eleven with other items you might need or want.< /text>< GmapID>

One of my best friend’s father suddenly passed away right before the Chinese New Year.  She was so stressful because they didn’t prepare.
Cecilia was very helpful, she went to my friend’s house to lead her to Skylawn because she is afraid she might get lost. Cecilia gave her a park tour and all other information. She made my friend feel comfortable and decided to use Skylawn.
It is because the ancestor had a daughter who lives in China want to come here for dad’s funeral , the funeral service had been delayed but Cecilia still very patient and waited.
On the day of the service, Cecilia and Stephanie both were there to help. The simple and elegant funeral, my friend was relived that her father was buried in Skylawn.
Finally, we really appreciate Cecilia and her teem and will highly recommend Cecilia to my friends<//Text>

The community service adviser, Luis Vizcardo, helped me by answering all the questions I had regarding a possible land plot. He treated me with respect and patience as I asked him a million questions. I was nervous about this at first but was put at ease. On top of that the place itself is magnificent!</Text>

<Text>I recently preplanned my Funeral arrangements with Elizabeth Barrett at Skylawn. She was very knowledgeable. She gave me a Preplanning Guide that I found very useful. I keep all my funeral wishes & choices that I want my family to know in there. Also Skylawn has some of my choices on file. When my time comes everything will be arranged. They also offered me a easy low interest payment plan. Preplanning gives me peace of mind that my family will not have to worry.

I highly recommend Elizabeth Barrett for any  funeral needs she is very accommodating & got all my needs taken care of.< /Text><rate>5< /rate><Date>1614626098029</Date>< pictures>

The best analogy to the experience of buying funeral arrangements from Skylawn is that of buying a used car.

Make sure you carefully scrutinize the proposal you receive and ask questions about every single line item (e.g., what is this and does the charge include everything you think you may be getting?).  And be prepared to be "nickle & dimed" for every small detail, most of which cannot be justified by the actual product or service being delivered (e.g., "Oh you want one extra word on the marker?  That'll be another $150" (or whatever the charge may be)).  It's a great location, but you'll probably wind up paying more than you were originally led to believe.  Overall, working with Skylawn is not a great experience, especially when dealing with the loss of a loved one.

I've never buried anyone up in Colma or Daly City but I suspect your experience will be better and less expensive simply because the number of cemeteries up there provides some competition.< /Text>

<Review>My mom passed away suddenly without a pre-arranged final resting place. My dad was cremated in 2001, and all we knew was that mom’s wish was that they be buried together when the time came. Since mom’s brother and parents are buried at Skylawn, we chose to make an appointment to see if there was a plot available close to them. Our coordinator, John Hui, was so gentle and caring during this difficult time. His goal was to learn a little about mom, and what we wanted so he could help us make the right decisions. We are very grateful for his knowledge and care of people during a most stressful time. The initial meeting and planning mom’s arrangements came together nicely. Skylawn is such a beautiful location. It is so peaceful with awesome views. My husband and I were so pleased with the process that we prearranged our final resting place near mom and dad. .I would definitely recommend Skylawn Memorial Park.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

After paying large fees to bury a family member, it would seem prudent of Skylawn to at least allow people to visit their loved ones until sunset. However, Skylawn has decided that after 6 pm you are not able to do so and the gate will be closed. Tough luck if your schedule doesn't allow you to visit before then<//text>

Use to be much nicer, peaceful place, with many trees. But a landscape planner there seems eager to kill them off. She claims they were cut down due to disease, which seems false because the trees outside the cemetery are fine and not diseased. Probably a move to add more burial sites, i.e. increase profit. Next big rain without the tree roots holding the soil, the buried will probably slide off the hills, making room for new coffins. Now the place looks like a tacky attempt at kitschy "posh". Nature and natural landscape ruined.<//Text>

I used to work up here a lot and have visited this location numerous times. If I had wanted to be buried somewhere beautiful this is the place. Loved ones who visit this space will feel overwhelming tranquility and peace in the light of this natural area. The staff here are all incredibly kind and understanding. Additionally there are dedicated service roads to prevent disruptions. The energy here is really good.< /review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>The funeral director and staff at Skylawn were very professional yet comforting, level-headed and considerate of details that we hadn't thought about.  They were very accomodating, making the process of laying my mother to rest as easy as possible under the circumstances when so many other institutions make the process of disconnection so difficult.  My family and I will always be grateful for their care and support, and for how well the Skylawn staff worked with our mortuary in Sonoma County.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>This was a great place to walk. Very interesting! Could use more trees, but very tranquil, with great views. (edit:  I just read Cadillac Desert and now think trees are inappropriate for this location! lol)
I came here to go for a walk; this is the 1st Buddhist cemetery I've been to!  I enjoyed noticing the shape of the cemetery and the sculptures and ornamentation.</Text>< UserId.>

This is a cemetery but you can go there as long as you're not making too much noise and have kids just running around this is a beautiful place I have no problem being the cemetery I'm not superstitious this is some of the most incredible artwork from the Chinese community that I've ever seen and the view is just incredible I go up your every once in a while and have lunch believe it or not and enjoy the view and walk around and check out the headstones this has a great Veterans Memorial and it has an honest to God pet cemetery this is a huge place and as long as you're keeping it down no one will bother you because they think you're there visiting someone you know! well I don't know anybody up there but I go and look at the pictures on some of the headstones and I give them tribute. you can just drive through if you want but it would be silly not to enjoy the view it's a million-dollar view< /Text>

I am writing this complaint with great agony and anger.

My father and I decided to choose Skylawn funeral Home and Cemetery on Sunday,6/17/2018, night. We called them to pick up my mother's remains. When they came, they drove a van with another body in the vehicle. I called many times for a hearse before.

On Monday morning, we met Endeliza Huerta who helped us plan the funeral. I told her that we will take my mother's remains to another religious facility for a ceremony and take her back to the cemetery to bury. And at that time, we did not decide to embalming or not. So we did not sign the contract.

And on that day, my father and I went to the cemetery to finally decide the plot. We met Matthew Wong, a consultant,  and decided a plot, A, which is located on the right side of a tree. He gave us 5% off. We did not sign but promise to give him an answer Tuesday.  He said on Tuesday he is off work and another female coworker will help us.

The female consultant is Angela Ung. In the Tuesday, 06/19/2018, morning, she immediately added a vault setting fee of 500$ into our contract. She wrote over the 'Vase' and said Matthew Wong forgot it. We had no choice but had to accept it. And she showed us the plot again. But this time, the plot was on the left side of the tree. My father and I felt wrong but she insisted on that she is right.

In the afternoon, close to 4:30pm, we see the funeral contract. I found a fee named 'Religious Facility Funeral Ceremony'. I disagreed with this fee since we have our ceremony at another facility other than their funeral home. Endeliza brought a director named Kim Rifredi. Kim told me because there are gonna be two staff from their funeral home will be standing outside the ceremony, so they have to charge the fee, 725$. I argued with them that it is a robbery on last minutes. Kim told me I can take my mother's remains to another funeral home if I do not pay this fee. And they will not charge me anything. However, I do not have time to choose another cemetery or funeral home. As at that time, I have to bury my mother soon due to religious requirement. I accepted it. I asked them do not take it out on my mother. And we agreed that I will pay them using credit card tomorrow, 06/20/2018. And that Wednesday is the day for funeral and burial. The hearse will start driving to Santa Clara at 11am 06/20/2018. They will arrive at 12pm sharp. And the ceremony will be finished at 2pm. Then the hearse will take my mother's remains back. And the burial will begin at 3pm that day.

On 06/20/2018, due to my fight with Kim and Endeliza, they tried every means to make my mother and my family suffer.

My father and I arrived at 10:40am. We waited 10 more minutes for Endeliza showed up. She came with two staff, James the hearse driver and Jons sitting on side driver. It is close to 11am, but instead of hitting the road, she asked me for credit card to pay the bill. I gave her two cards. And it costed more than 20 minutes for her to process the credit cards. And one of the card is on my mother's name, though I told Endeliza that my mother is just an additional card holder. Endeliza had called the bank and confirmed and wasted a lot of times. We were in a hurry.

Finally we started driving almost at 11:30am. When I rushed to the door to my car saying 'we are going to be late.' Endeliza replied in an indifferent tone, ' It is what it is.'

The hearse drove at no more than 55 miles per hour on hwy to Santa Clara. And on hwy, the driver was not paying attention. The hearse was on lines often and been bumpy. There was a time that even an accident would have happened with another rear car since the hearse was off the lane.

And when we got off hwy and about to arrived at the destination, they missed the turn and drove to the wrong place. I had to get of my car and direct them to the right route.

We arrived at 12:27pm. 27 minutes late. James, told me they did not see the sign of the street.  And I asked them on the return trip, keep the hearse inside lane. They pretended that they do not understand.(limits reached</review>

The staff was very kind and compassionate to a certain extent. When we where going to start procession my daughter father was left behind because they were in such a rush. Then they decided they would carry my child to her resting place when I was specific her father and brothers would. We didn’t even have any chairs at the site. Found out later we were rushed cuz another infant was being buried also. Went to visit couple days later and met the mother of the other child. Here is the topper she said the day of the funeral they  mistakened her with me and showed her my baby. How could you do that to grieving mothers? You see this beautiful place and imagine everything will be top notch but they just want you in and out. I noticed someone else say they have the grounds keepers standing right over your guest not a welcoming sight. Hope no one else has to deal with my experience.</Text>

Tip: if local, geotag a picture of the view from your loved one's location at the funeral so you can reference the map for future visits.

I forgot to do this, so when we got lost trying to visit a year later, we called the office and the family service counselor came out in his car and had us follow him. He gave us a map with the marked spot for future reference and shook our hands to tell us it is an honor to serve our family. I thought that was wonderful service.

On a side note, you might be able to catch deer visit and eat the fresh flowers near closing time. I think it is a nice way to not waste flowers, but if that bothers you, go to the website for a guide on the flowers for a list of "deer resistant" flowers.< /text>

<Review>Having just experienced the lost of our mother, we appreciated the seeming expertise and  efficiency of the staff, Cindy Naras (funeral director) and Kenny Pun (family service counselor). However, in the days following our initial planning meeting the following occurred:

*   After expressing our concern that the grave site not be opened for everyone to      see on the funeral day when there was to be prayers and blessings said at the site,
it WAS exposed showing the uncovered concrete vaults and the dirt walls. This was emotionally distressing to the family and unnecessary for the children age 3-8 to see!

*   Within 20 ft. of the open grave site were two grounds keepers waiting, obviously
to do the task of putting the urns in the ground - another most disturbing image.

*   The  pink flower arrangement which we ordered with the on site florist was lavender purple.

*   The photo that was to be used to create the little prayer cards to distribute was
lost.  It was a very special photo that we had specially wanted showing both our mom and dad.

*   The blue fabric bag that covered mom's urn had the name "Matthew"
embroidered on it.  Mom's name was Irma!

+  The buffet lunch that was catered at the recommendation of the funeral home
was pathetic, especially considering the amount of money that it cost.

*   Off to the right of the main entrance door of Skylawn was some type of
burner incinerator type device.  Obviously, it was visually disturbing and out of place.

*   On the lower level, just outside the luncheon room and under the staircase, were
two wheel barrels that were covered with dirt and cement remnants. This was another
very distasteful site.

Although we were initially treated with concern and cordiality, the experiences that followed were most insensitive and heart wrenching. We realize the delicate nature
of this business in dealing with people who are in emotional turmoil.  For that reason, we share our experiences in hopes that no one else will endure such.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

How does one review a cemetery. Skylawn has one hell of a view. Though, the people here aren't very lively. Working here is considered a dead end job. There isn't much upward movement. Everyone seems to be pushing up daisies for a place to fit in.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) This place is a cemetery managed by a private enterprise, surrounded by mountains and rivers, with beautiful scenery, which is in line with the Chinese people's feng shui and numerology. Therefore, many Chinese people who could not return to their homeland bought and buried them here.

(Original)
這地方是私人企業管理的墓地，依山傍水，風景優美，很符合中國人的風水命理。因此，許多不能回歸故土的唐人，在這買地下葬。</text>

I like the vet here, have had good experiences with routine check-ups as well as in emergencies. However, your customer service is horrible. I have been trying for the past month to schedule an appointment with you all - from calling many times, to filling out an appointment request form on your site. I never get a call back or any kind of confirmation. I know from experiences past, that I will not get anything scheduled unless I speak to someone live on the phone. However, no one ever seems to pick up the phone anymore... and your voicemail box has been full for weeks. Is there a point to the online form if no one follows up?

Disappointing, as I’d like to keep my dog going to you all since you know his medical history. But your poor service has put me in a bind and is forcing me to go elsewhere. I can’t kept waiting and hoping someone is going to follow up.<//text>

<Review>When I went into their office I thought it would be a long wait but the moment I walked in -- they had me fill out a form for my dog and within 10 minutes brought me in with him and gave him his shots. What I loved about it is that on a Saturday you can get the vaccinations at a discounted price which is what I use to pay for a vet I went to out in the Valley but glad this location was just around the corner (literally). The receptionist/technician was very sweet and I appreciate them taking care of me and my dog.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWHWDe5S6itZtDxw0_OSgXlNbjc-9OjxMqbTi_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c2bf53d8c9efa3:0xab92ca8ec87ca870<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

One of which (brunette) completely ignored me and the second (Caucasian w/ kitty mask) who ignored and mocked me for about 15 minutes and then came and proceeded to insult me and threaten me in the parking lot for “not knowing that I was supposed to call and not come to door”. We were never advised of this nor warned that we would be shooed away. All I am going to say is thank god it wasn’t an emergency.. we would like our transcripts for our animals transferred to somewhere more professional.

<Text>I would have given AMCH a 1 based on today's HORRIFIC experience but gave them a 2 because in the past, when there was no emergency mind you I believe I remember that they seemed ok and because I want readers to know this is a well thought out review and not simply reactionary because trust me they now really deserve a very sturdy ONE....at best. I woke up to find our lil Snowball hobbling off his right hind leg. He does have a propensity to bite at his paws as it seems he has a slight grass allergy so i thought he might have harmed himself slightly OR could be some kind of strain, pulled muscle, fracture or worse. Both ladies at the front desk were very unhelpful, even borderline rude, not great for a vet 5 blocks from our place that we were now regulars at, because we hadn't made an appointment. I though the word HOSPITAL on the front meant something, I know it doesn't say emergency but come on show just a bit of compassion or even empathy..... Finally after telling them I wanted to tell the doctor "goodbye" , which my wife smartly instructed me to do as they were possibly losing our business, the vet finally showed his face after about a half hour only to be even ruder than the ladies and wanted to give me a speech full of "I told you so's" because he had a surgery upcoming to which I desperately wanted to tell him he could have already just felt up his leg for a sec as I was really worried and till now a good customer, but I held back. In the end they actually had the nerve to request I just leave him there indefinitely just in case they MIGHT have an opening while our snowball sat and suffered and I went home to worry. Now I found out they truly deserve the 1,  my wife just reminded me of the time they made us wait a week and a half for an appointment and then "lost the appointment" and then were hinting that we should thank them for fitting us in after "only" two hours past our appointment, as if they were doing US a favor?! We found another vet....so should U.  Next time remember the people paying your bills have actual feelings when their furry family members are in distress and they need compassion and not what you gave today, collectively.</Text>< pics>

Took ny Maltipoi pup for her vaccines and a physical to make sure she was doing good. They were amazing, the location is small but clean and nice looking.  Plenty of parking in front, the front desk girls were pleasant and quick with everything they were doing. The Dr. Checked my pup very well and she was not even nervous with him. She ended up getting her shots and some stuff for a very mild  ear infection.  We found our new vet!<//Text>

<text>I am extremely pleased with Animal Medical Center, and especially with Dr. Snively. He is gentle with my cat and has a great rapport with Sasha's human - me. While the tests that I had taken on Sasha last time I was there were expensive (I'm on a limited income) and I was able to pay with CareCredit, it was good to find out what was going on with my sweet cat. Now I just have to wait for the blood test and x-ray results.< /text><user_id>116166277154714139649< /user_id>< Resp>

Dr Snively is the real deal. Gentle, kind with my pup. The prices are reasonable and no one there is pushing for things your pup doesn't need. Ten stars really.<//Review>

<text>This place is clean and nice , but the staff is full of crap. I took my cat in for a check up because I thought he had a urinary infection .The doctor stated that he might be passing crystals so they ran some test. After doing some expensive test the test results came back clean and the doctor just recommended a diet change. The didn't offer any medication or anything.  I trusted them because WELL THERE DOCTORS?! 3 weeks later the problem persist with my cat.  I took him back to see what my other options were and as a cat mom i was worried. The offered me the same test and a new one for  MORE money! I was furious that they would charge me for the same test twice when they claimed it was clear the first time.  This place is money hungry and not  really concerned about your pet or you! None of the doctors know whats going on. They just run inconclusive test for hundreds of dollars to give you a vague answer that leads to more hundred dollars test! My cat is still in pain and after spending all of this money i got nothing! Dr. Hanna advised me that maybe I shouldn't have a pet if  concerned about the price of the test. There just doing there job the best that they can she says., and if i dont trust them go else where. This place is a trip. beware of the fraud... I had to get a refund and take my cat somewhere else.< /text><Name>Fatimah Taliah<//Name><gmap_id>0x80c2bf53d8c9efa3:0xab92ca8ec87ca870</gmap_id><resp>None<//resp>< user_id>

I called ahead to explain the issue (my cat had injured a leg) only to be told, after exams were done and she’d been given painkillers, that she couldn’t be fully treated at this facility. Additionally, upon arrival at the second facility, I was informed that the X-rays taken at AMC were unclear and unusable. I feel like this demonstrates a complete and total disregard for the well-being of an animal- If you know the problem and know you cannot treat it, tell me so I can take her somewhere else and she can receive the care she needs immediately instead of two hours later. Also not a fan of being charged 250 for useless X-rays. The staff was friendly and polite but I could never bring myself to trust them with my animal again after the lack of respect that was shown for her pain and suffering.<//text>

<Text>Full disclosure: my first review here would've been two stars. The front office staff was great and the facilities were clean, but the doctor was a jaded billing machine who didn't explain anything but definitely wanted every test in the book done when I came in with my sick senior dog. I was coming in for what I thought was my final visit just to get the preliminary results and find another vet when we met Dr. An -- a conscientious doctor who will go over your options, ask about your pet even if you're just coming in for a refill, and explain everything BEFORE it happens. 5 stars as long as he stays!<//Text>< userid>

I was here to inquire about services before even taking my cat in.  Staff was very helpful and friendly.  Office is clean and welcoming.  Upon bringing my cat in for an official visit, I was offered a free consultation (which is unheard of.  It's often $50+) to determine what would have to be done.  Again, friendly, helpful staff.
Did have to wait a while before being seen.  I don't know if that's a normal occurrence.< /Text>

I've tried a few vets in the Los Feliz area and settled on this group, and Dr. Snively is a compassionate, well informed and helpful doctor who has helped my cats stay well and healthy. The facility is clean and the staff are friendly. It's a great location, too, for we Hollywood dwellers. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</Review>

Their emotional support was simply amazing as I made the ultimate hard decision to end her suffering.

I am sure there have been positive experiences in the past here. But upon arrival the staff seemed really under informed when I asked about the health certificate requirements for flying my Dog to Canada. They couldn't decide between 10 and 14 days and were bickering so I stepped away and said I will Google it myself.
Also the Dr on staff became extremely argumentive and hostile when I asked him to explain why the scrotal tissue is retained during neuturing. He became so furious that he lost control of himself and said go see another vet. I am not going to recommend anyone see this office as the staff did not go over the procedure details prior to me agreeing for the surgery and only when I asked questions about what it entailed felt entitled enough to be arrogant and rude. There is no need to patronize your customers or to take a yelling tone with them ever. A position of regard is not rights to be authoritarian over a customer. That's not a great bedside manner and shows me that the attention and care is seriously lacking there. Not a place for anyone's pet(s).</Text>

Dr Snively is the main Vet there now. (Dr An - who is mentioned in another comment - was tremendous, but has moved on.) Dr Snively spends a good deal of time with you & explains your pet's condition (or wellness). He makes follow up calls. He is also a good surgeon. Staff is very nice. I give 4 stars because the place is expensive. & unlike many Vets, there are no breaks for rescue people who trap & release. However, they do low cost innoculations on Saturdays.</text>

I took my dog in for a check because she was in heat but bleeding excessively, her abdomen was distended, she had a hard time walking, not interested in eating and other symptoms.

The vet firstly did not wear gloves while touching her vulva and buttonhole. Which I found very odd and he could spread bacteria to my dog.

He said he has never seen the signs my dog exhibited. Odd because a quick google of her symptoms point to pyometra. He never even mentioned the possibility of pyometra. His first guess was that perhaps a larger dog had perforated her cervix. So weird. He also stated that it could be a tumor or pollups  inside but could not confirm without x- rays and bloodwork. That seems reasonable but the x- ray was going to cost $250. When asked why he said because there are x-ray technicians who review the x-rays so that the Dr's dont "miss anything". Ok good to know the techs know more than the vets. I declined the x-ray and blood work because I had very little confidence in his abilities.
He didn't clearly communicate what it is LIKELY to be. I get that you don't know until x-ray or blood work but having absolutely no clue or inkling is off-putting.
I would recommend going to a different vet. This clinic seemed clueless. I paid a consultation fee for nothing.<//Text>

Bartenders are always friendly and there's always some great local entertainment. Plus they have outdoor seating, corn hole, pool table and darts.</Review>

The best bar in Folsom hands down! I always have a good time here with my friends, there’s great bartenders and the outside patio is perfect. It’s right on the lake so it’s perfect to grab a beer and then head down to paddle board or fish.
The owners go out of their way to make the times feel normal but while also still following all the guidelines. I’ll recommend this place to everyone.</Text>

<review>We did a hike nearby, found Folsom State Slickers and stopped for a snack and drink. Super friendly atmosphere and family owned. We sat on deck which had fans and mister...it was really nice as it was 100 out but did not feel like it. We definitely recommend and will be back!< /review>< user_id>

I struggled between 3 and four stars, but the service, price, and flavors were enough to bring it up a star.

With Marnee Thai down the block, Chabaa offers unique flavors and a wider menu of Thai and other Asian-inspired foods. However, two of our plates came out partially cold, even though the taste was phenomenal. Would recommend the noodle dishes, as the a la carte plates may have some questionably cooked meats.

Pricing is food for lunch, and space was plentiful. Parking can be difficult on Irving, but driving two blocks above or below should net you a spot.< /review>

I hadn’t been by here in a long time, but decided to get takeout. I picked up the chicken satay, pad thai, and red curry.

The chicken satay was fantastic, but I rarely find any that isn’t. The red curry was pretty average - it was lacking a little bit on the actual flavor but it had a really nice consistency and a bit of heat.

The pad thai was downright bad. It was way too sweet, had an odd, overwhelming sour taste, and lacked any peanuts. The tofu wasn’t quite cooked right and it was sliced into these strange pads that just didn’t fit.

The real issue comes with the price tag. For below average thai food, I ended up spending $45. I understand that this is San Francisco and all, but if the quality isn’t there then that’s just not right.<//text>

Service here is amazing. Happy hour everyday from 5-8, which includes food specials. Some of my favorite panang curry and coconut rice in San Francisco.< /Review>

<Review>My go-to in SF for cheap Thai food! Service is quick and the restaurant is small but great food for a great price. I always take people here and most of the time I've been lucky to not stand in line. Friends have loved it and I'll keep coming back!< /Review><user_id>102658928010135106317<//user_id>< gmapID>

I like this place. A less popular and crowded spot compared to Marnee down the street. It's kind of a hidden gem in that regard. Pickup is a good option here, prices are very reasonable. I like the Pad Thai or fried rice. All super good.< /review>

<review>Quaint and cozy spot with an incredibly expansive menu. Service was friendly, helpful  and quick. The roti is spectacular, and panaeng unparalleled. The portions aren't the biggest, but are perfectly sized to leave room for one of their many tasty desserts!</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Conveniently a block and a half from Union Square. Small restaurant, but they have really delicious and filling food at good prices. Tom Yum is definitely the move, but I recommend getting the Tom Yum noodle bowl (not the one in the soup section). Much more filling and comes with a variety of meats.<//Text>

ATMOSPHERE:
This restaurant is long and dimly lit when we went here for dinner. There's not a lot of decorations here and it's pretty empty.

FOOD:
I got the basil chicken rice plate and thought that what I ordered barely had any meat in it which was a bummer. My boyfriend got the flat noodle rice with beef and I thought that was better! Sorry I don't know the name in Thai!

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
The customer service here was average. They acknowledged us, got our food in a timely manner, and put our food in the to-go box for us.</review>

It's not the best Thai in the city, but it's solid on food and good service! We were trying to go to Underdogs on a Friday night, but that place was packed, so we took our talents to Chabaa and were not disappointed! If you like Thai and you're in the neighborhood, try it out!</review>

I go here instead of the more popular Marnee Thai down the street. The food is just as good and it's open much later. Also, you're not crammed close enough to be sitting on a stranger's lap like at Marnee Thai.</text>

I'd stay away from ordering Rad na, the duck fried rice was only OK.. I also ordered panag curry which did not come with a rice (what kind of Thai restaurant doesn't have rice with an entree??? A cheap one). Maybe I was unlucky and got a cold server, maybe the chef had a bad day, but I wont spend my money here again eating mediocre food< /Review>< GmapID>

I've only done delivery from here. The pad thai is subar, but I love the coconut rice so much that I'll order from here just to get that.</review>

For me, being Thai, I really like their food!
You should try Tom Yum Kung and papaya salad!< /text>

<review>Chabaa's biggest misfortune is living in the shadow of its objectively superior Thai competitor, Marnee.  But, Chabaa is less expensive, open later, and less crowded, so there are plenty of scenarios where this is the place you really want to go.< /review>< pics>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>We stopped at Chabaa Thai on our way to find Marnee Thai. For dinner, we shared the Tom Sua (Papaya salad with vermicelli noodle, crispy fish and pork rind) and the Pad Si-Yu (stir-fried flat rice noodles with egg, Chinese broccoli, and soy sauce), which were both delicious. Beware that some of the long green bits in the Tom Sua are green beans while others are green Thai chilies. I made that mistake and had a burning mouth, sweat  dripping the rest of my dinner. Their Thai Ice Tea is good, though too much sugar for my personal taste.

Street parking is available, though may be hard in the evenings.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x8085877002c591b9:0xbf7088ae7a138829<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Several years ago, during my first visit, my initial reaction to Chabaa was negative. At best it was mediocre Chinese food and not worth a re-visit. However when I read SF Weekly’s piece on Chabaa’s secret menu I decided to give it another shot.

I ordered the much raved pork neck and I haven’t looked back since. The fatty meat is described as “bouncy” by Jonathan Kauffman and I have not found a better word to explain the texture of the meat. Bouncy is a strange word to attribute to meat, but the well marbled and firm meat definitely have bounce. Kauffman succinctly states that “its texture is more the midpoint between hanger steak and a grapefruit segment, releasing a cascade of juices with each bite.”

It’s accompanied by a mouth watering  fermented fish based dip called jaew that kicks this dish up a notch. It’s gotten spicier over the years, but it’s still very pungent and delicious.

I now consider most items on the regular menu to be decent, but if you crave for something flavorful, explore the secret menu!</review>

<rate>4<//rate><text>This place is like any other typical thai restaurant but I tend to come here more often because it has more of a nice Thai restuarant style feel to it. Also it's right next to Teaway so that's awesome! My favorite here is pad see ew and roast duck fried rice. Also one thing I like about this place is that they give you more peanuts you can add to your dishes if you'd like. I've never seen any other Thai restaurant give you that option!</text>< pictures>

My favorite Thai restaurant in SF. Their other location on Geary is more convient (we can take the BART and then walk there) but this location on Irving has the full Isaan menu that we crave.

Their Som Tom salad is legit, especially when you ask it to be Thai spicy (the only way to eat Som Tom), their Tom Kha is well balanced (a must!), and their Isaan Sausage will make you want to order it again! We have yet to be served a less than stellar dish here, everything is light years better than Marnee Thai (or other good-by-SF-standards Thai).

Try it out, you won't be disappointed!</Text>

My favorite Thai place not only in SF but in USA We have been working in the area for for than a month. Lately its been an hour+ drive to eat here, well worth the drive. Ordered Hoi-Jor, Chicken Tom Ka, Pad Pra Ram served over crispy noodles instead of rice. Eat the sticky rice with mangos. OMG We have eaten here at least 2 times a week for the last month.

<review>Michoacan style Mexican cuisine
Fair pricing! $1.50 tacos & every other item seems reasonable considering this is a brick & mortar not a truck

The tacos, chicken & beef were clean & flavourful. The corn tortillas were delicious. Not overly soft or hard. Pretty straight forward

Typically off put by being charged for chips & salsa but I will pay again & again here. They served what seemed to be basket of chips that would be easily annihilated but it nearly defeated two hungry persons that also had two tacos each. Nice chips, there’s a thinness to a fluffy crunch. Large. Just enough salt. A red & green sauce with tasteful kick. Their beans!!!! Wow! Mix all together, add to tacos, eat separately... whatever, so great

The owners are very kind & accommodating. The only drinks are bottled including water. There is beer. Will come back again :)
Thank y’all, with love from Texas< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGoJBKc41vOyvOlM9FX4SgbsJ3iWDZE17IdOZ4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0EdeZsSPnCUidTY6XsFEwwn71BSviokBIJdEQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGeLJK0S7dBp-CcZyMwnYvSSWs2FDL9b3rqpvj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNc7742VZKpBRIMmIAneGN_3zCp16lruyOogIxK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1574329016859, 'text': 'We are truly grateful for such an extensive and detailed review!

<Text>its close. & reasonable but id like to know whats up with all these places
the town i lived in you were given a small order of house corn chips with salsa. and more than half of the places ive been in stan co. do not offer to do so .
all of these places charge you for a super but they sell you a medium i should get some damn chips & salsa on the house .<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>
{'time': 1558393023275, 'text': 'Bery, We apologize for the inconvenience. We once offered complimentary chips and salsa. Unfortunately, some patrons abused our policy and therefore we had to resort to charging and converting it into a menu item. Although, we did modify our menu to make this item more appealing by adding not just one salsa like we previously gave; instead we now offer more chips with 2 different salsas and even a bean dip. Thank you for your input and we hope to see you back soon. -El Torito'}</resp>

Called in my order,  lady said it would be ready and confirmed it would be ready for pick up, I go in to pick up my order before my work shift starts. The lady just simply said, "Sorry we ran out of tortillas, we couldn't make your order" I was livid,  because I had no time to grab any lunch from any other place. I ended up working a 10 hr shift with no lunch. Bad customer service,  and didnt apologized for the unprofessionalism. Never going back and I will let my coworkers know of how unprofessional they are.</text>

Also the steam tacos were not as I imagined. If they were evaporated but not in the pot as they are the real STEAM TACOS SAD BUT SIERTO ...

This is how they know the region where the owner was born. What you describe are what we know as the Tacos De Canasta that are from the Cuedad De México, that taco is made in a pot and sold from a basket. Those are usually echos of pork rinds, beans, etc. And they are very cheap. But still excuse the confusion of our Steamed Tacos. Too bad he doesn't like me. Have a very good day. -El Torito Modesto.\n\n(Original)\nHola, buenos días. Disculpe que nadie contesto su llamada, estaremos más pendiente de el teléfono.

(Translated by Google) I will not go to this place to eat again, the lady who brought us the food did not have a good way of speaking. When we asked that if we could replace the horchata water because it tasted weird, he only replied with what she had taken it and she didn't think it was weird. They have to improve their customer service because the truth is that if you put one in a bad mood with the way they responded.

(Original)
No volveré a ir a este lugar a comer, la señora que nos trajo la comida no tuvo buena forma de hablar. Cuando pedimos que si nos podía remplazar el agua de horchata porque sabía rara solo nos respondió con qué ella se la había tomada y a ella no le sabía raro. Tienen que mejorar su customer service porque la verdad que si pone uno de mal humor con la forma en la que respondió.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The orchata water tasted horrible and I told them to replace it Ali which the owner refused, I understand that she was still drinking from that water which teaches that she doesn't care if she eats it the customers should eat it tmb although she doesn't they like it and the taco meat was hard my experience in this place was unpleasant

(Original)
La agua de orchata sabía horrible y les dije que lo remplazaran Ali cual se reuso el dueño disiendo que ella avía tomado de esa agua lo cual enseña que no le importa el cliente si ella se lo come los clientes se lo deben de comer tmb aunque no les guste y la carne de los tacos estaba dura mi experiencia en este lugar fue desagradable< /Text>

The part that others quoted to be installed was over $200. This Chicks Mobile beat them by $90. No run around, no hassle, no B.S.
Best part was, didn’t have to leave my phone or make trips back and forth to her shop. She came to me.
My new device repair company from now on. This Chicks Mobile.

Great job!< /review>< pics>

If you are going to leave a believable review please be more specific with the repair and what went wrong. We do offer hassle free warranty as warranty shouldn’t have to be a hassle. All my repairs come with 30 days which have now become 45 day warranty. Any computer or laptop repair have 3 year warranty for parts and 45 days with labor unless stated otherwise due to customer budget and the use of used parts. All repairs come with new parts unless you have a rare device that the only solution would be used parts but would need to ok the repair in writing as there would be a limited warranty of 15 days. All my repairs are posted on my website for customer to look and make a decision. We also accept customers parts but we don’t offer warranty. License # E93488, please find something better to do with your time.\n\nFor all future and current customers, take a look at my yelp reviews and Thumbtack reviews, those are not only difficult to get but they are the most believable as they are from real customers not a competitor who feels the pressure of the current times. It’s sad that they will have to result to low tactics to stay afloat. My recommendation provide something that customers need and work on their schedule.'}</Resp><review>This place is horrible charge me 200$ for a repair that costs 120$ at another place. The screen dont even work anymore. I tried calling but they dont answer after i brought up my issue. I went to check their license and this place is not even legal. I am very disappointed and i would recommend others not to use them. Very shady.</review>< rating>

Be advised! Unlicensed people who just asking for review. very poor job with fixing my daughters phone, screen started peeling and stopped working after only two weeks!< /Review>
<pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1598117612128, 'text': 'Hello Melissa Gutierrez, I believe you are mistaking us with another business as we don’t have any customer complaints regarding a screen peeling or any other device. Something like you mentioned would be 100% covered and we give customers a 30 day warranty on all repairs. We had a few customers that had issues with heir devices even after the warranty given elapsed and found out the part has failed and we replaced it with no issues. As long as there is no physical or liquid damage to the part. As to answer your question in regards to licensing, license #E93488. Again, if you have an issue with your phone screen peeling and you believe we are the right business you can call or text at this number 951-465-9698. Thank you!\n\nNote: This review has been reported to Google as a fake review that was left by a fellow competitor who feels this is the only way to get his profile to number 1 on the search engine.

This review and the last two reviews have been reported to Google as I believe that they are not customers but a fellow competitor who feels like this is the only way to make their profile stand out from everyone else. Another bad review by Geo M was put on Yelp but Yelp quickly deleted it because they knew this was nothing but a fake review, unfortunately with Google, I have to wait.\n\nA Message to the person writing these reviews;\n\nThank you for leaving this review because it shows the type of person you are by playing these children like games but this also confirms that you feel like this will tarnish my reputation I worked so hard for this past year. This doesn't bring me down in fact it makes me stronger because I know the type of technician I am. All my customers know what they are getting when they hire my services and most of them I been servicing for years. The longest customer I have is 15 plus years since I was in school learning all this technology stuff to become the technician that I am today. I hope that this gives you a bit of short-lived gratitude to make yourself feel superior in whatever way you feel fit too.  At the end of the day, I know what I bring to my customers and I don't have to worry about it. Instead of wasting your time writing bad reviews maybe you should concentrate on how to make your business more profitable and bring quality repairs to your customers as this will help you from using dirty tactics to sustain some credibility in this field. Inland Empire is big and there is plenty of customers for everyone, relax, I can't service them all."}</response>< UserId.>

After waiting almost an hour to ask if I wanted food I was informed that the kitchen was closed for 45 minutes. Then he sold me a bag of chicharrones and another bag of peanuts for $5 each. A $10 dinner that was pulled from beneath the bar in plastic bags that would have been better if purchased at 7-Eleven for $3. I took it and ate it on a bus bench nearby and it was better than it deserved. But the Ambiance of the bar at the location was pretty good and the beer selection was okay.<//text>

My new favorite restaurant in the area. I had excellent mushroom soup and the Hawaiian pork egg rolls. I don't usually use any sauce with my food but the sauce with the egg rolls was delicious. Washed down with a couple of Boddington drafts made a most excellent night. The waitress Amy was delightful she will be a star someday.< /Review>

Try the gypsy stew, the best play on chicken tortilla soup I've ever had. The front of house is a loud, friendly bar atmosphere and the patio in the back is nice and quiet with heat lamps and seat cushions. If they offer you a ginger hooch, say yes!<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Best spot in Mar Vista.  Great vibes, awesome staff, patio in the front and back. 2 TVs for sports and the food is amazing.  Must try their mushroom soup it's by far the best I've ever had, cheesy bastard, Monte Crisco egg roll, or hip tang.  It's my favorite neighborhood bar.<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< pictures>

Great spot in the Mar Vista area. The food is awesome. I tried the breakfast burrito, French toast, and chicken and pancakes, all from the brunch menu. Everything was unique and tasty with southern inspiration. Portions were ample. Service was great as well! Highly recommended.<//text>

It used to be fantastic and unique. Now even though they kept the same name for some reason, it's a new owner, new chef, new drink menu. The charm of the history of the building and it's honey bees is absent. The ridiculously amazing chicken is gone. Just a small menu of bar-ish snack foods... The toast was okay, but a lot of work to eat and constantly assemble. And it was rather burnt so prepare to cut your mouth up.<//text>

Used to be one of my favorite dinner spots. Now with new menu an ownership, I won't be back. The chips and fried chickepeas were good, which is why I gave it the second star. The Gem salad was nothing special, and the "Vietnamese" chicken special was extremely salty. My husband got the burger, and he also said it was incredibly salty and was not worth the $17 price.</text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>It's great to have Louie's in the area. We sat outside (it was fairly loud inside with the concrete floors bouncing sounds all over). I started with the Kahlua Pork Egg-rolls. They were tender and excellent! I had a Scrimshaw Beer, it was nice and cold. My problem was that the tried chicken which is one of their signature items was overcooked and the meat was dry on two of the three pieces. The waitress was so busy (kind of hard to get here attention) that it was eat it or have a longer wait. I will be back as the flavors and vibes are good here. I'm just hoping that the Chicken problem was isolated.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Delicious food! So much mouthwatering goodness. The gulf shrimp is amazing. Menu was hard to understand since there weren't specifications of the type of dish so you could accidentally order an appetizer thinking it's a main dish.<//Review>

<text>I came here twice last weekend. The first time there was a minor issue with my groups drinks and the bartender took care of it before we could even complain (which we weren't planning on doing). The next day, I came in for dinner with another friend, and we were blown out of our minds with how amazing the food was. Not only an original menu, fantastic craft selection, and amazing service, but the whole bar has this cozy small-city vibe where it feels like everyone there is a regular customer. Something I've been really missing having recently moved out here from Grand Rapids, MI. This is seriously the best spot in Mar Vista so if you're a local, definitely check it out!</text><gmapID>0x80c2ba5c5f4e6adb:0x287b59f3dcb7bac0< /gmapID>< userid>

Came here based off the reviews of the "old" Louie's.. After reading most of these comments I can understand the concern about the quality of this place going down even though I never got the chance to visit this place under its original ownership. I was looking forward to trying a number of dishes I saw on Yelp but apparently those were all pictures from the food options before new ownership took over.< /text>

A solid showing in the revival of cocktail culture continuing in L.A. Great neighborhood feel, tasty eats, and very friendly staff. If I had a minor quibble, I'd say that it's already so much closer to gastropub-meets-speakeasy than it is to sports bar (which is a good thing, as there are already more than enough of the lattet), that they'd be well served to ditch the two flat screens and go full old school.

That said, for those who want to be able to catch a bit of the game in a low-key setting while imbibing a much-better-than-average cocktail and high-quality comfort-food apps, this place might seem like heaven.</text>

Also, the guy next to us started watching a video on his phone really loudly, which felt intensely rude, and set the tone for the whole visit.</Review>< Rating>

Decent food and atmosphere. It was disappointing coming back to Louie's after a few years since its grand opening. They seemed to have changed their menu and atmosphere to be more mainstream, and in the process, lost a lot of what made them unique.</text>

<text>I have lived and eaten all over the world, and eaten many types and course of cuisines. Louie's offers the best I have ever eaten and I still crave. Honestly, it's so good it's worth flying into LAX periodically, getting a room in the Hilton, taking a cab down to Louie's and just feasting until one cannot do it anymore. I recommend the following dishes above all else:

Togarishi Bacon Fries, Kahlua Pig Monte Cristo Egg Roll, Potted Shrimp Louisiana, Insane Mushroom Crostini, American Standard Cheeseburger, Smoked Prosciutto Steak Burger.

For a final drink, the "Bee Sting" is unforgettable. Drink three, so that you will need a cab to take you home and don't forget to pick a dessert before you do.< /text><username>Don Schley</username>< Resp>

< review>
* Summary *

Awesome spot. Passed by dozens of times commuting to and from work before discovering it on Yelp. Now I'm a regular and usually spend 3 hours eating and working here once or twice a week.

* Service. Rating: 5 out of 5 *

Each of the ~6 servers I've had have been friendly, professional and knowledgeable about the menu. When I'm torn between 2 menu items, I always get the valuable feedback needed to make a confident decision.

* Food and Drinks. Rating: 4.5 out of 5 *

Full bar and good drink selection, including several that include freshly made honey from the rooftop bee hive.

A wild array of exotic, reasonably priced, dishes that fuse latin,  asian and american influences. Meat lovers have a particularly great selection. While there are a few non-meat options, I would not recommend this place for vegetarians. The Costa Rican Bowl (on the specials menu), Remy Bim Bap, and Fried Brussels Sprouts are among my favorites.

As for desert, the Red Velvet ice cream is, quite possibly, the best ice cream I've ever had. Sadly it's a special item that's not always available.

* Atmosphere and Ambiance. Rating: 4.5 out of 5 *

Looks a bit plain and ordinary on the outside, but is much nicer inside. The people are fun and friendly. The front gets crowded and noisy during the evenings and there's often music and sometimes spontaneous dancing. But there is a patio in the back that is available until 10pm if you're looking for a more calm and quiet vibe.

* Tips *

Happy hour. On the weekend until 5pm. $2 off any regular menu item.

Dessert Leftovers. Sometimes even when a dessert is not listed on the specials menu, there may be some left over from the last time it was available. Just ask your server to check.</review>

If I could give a zero to this place I would one of the worst customer service I have ever encountered from an angry waitress to a useless manager wow way to go people. There are people out there that need jobs and are kind. Hire those people.</Review>

This place is so good! Their service and food is amazing. They were recommended by a friend and we are so glad we went. Everything was so good. The only bad thing was we ate too much! We are going to make this our place to eat every time we go to Tahoe. Thank you for the great experience and food!!<//Text>

<Text>Their food and their service is outstanding. The menu is on the pricey side but worth every penny for the professional dining experience they provide. It feels like a special occasion even when it's not.  They space out dining groups giving a very safe feeling. Their servers are wonderful. Gabe is our favorite, very courteous.

<review>Service was excellent. Plenty of parking. Not too busy. Easy access location with a red light on the parking lot so its trivial to leave even during traffic. Food arrived very quickly, maybe in 10 or 15 minutes, and was cooked to perfection.< /review>< date>

<text>Harrah's $350. a nite. 5 star. I'm sorry the bathroom hadn't been swept or cleaned in day's. The restaurants smelled like unclean old food. The hotel has not been kept up in the last few years. Bill's  gone so is his hotel.< /text>< pics>

Very nice and intimate setting. Families sat at least six feet apart due to covid regulations,  which made the place quieter. Service was great and they had some great vegetarian choices which I want. The angel hair pasta dish with tomatoes (not sauce), black olives, and capers was heavenly - didn't make you feel full, but delighted you with the flavors. Good wine selection too. Definitely worth going to,  more than once. Reservations a must,  so don't expect to go and find space easily.< /review>

This place was amazing. My wife and I had our anniversary dinner here. Service was impeccable and the food was soooooo good. My wife had the chicken and ravioli and I had the Osso Bucco special. My Osso bucco was perfectly braised and so tender.  We purchased an order of focaccia too to dip in the yummy sauce! We will be back for sure. This place is not to be missed!< /Review>

<review>Attended during a girls weekend. The service was great. The food is DELICIOUS. Everyone got a different dish and Everyone was very pleased. Only thing is that I wished they had other beverages other than wine. A cocktail would've been great. But atmosphere and food were great. A must when there.< /review><Time>1601911103507< /Time><response>None< /response>< Rate>

One of the very best in town if you're craving for a feast of Italian food. All the classics made with the freshest of ingredients. Good selection of wine to choose from. Ask for chef recommendation.</Review>

Awesome food. It is costly but worth trying if you like italian. 1star less coz ambience is not that great, though it is clean and hygenic. But the team is good. They waited patiently for us to finish food peacefully.</text>

<text>Food was very good!!!!!!!!

The staff was a bit off, not the italian vibe at all...

Your host was very rigid and an empty restaurant we were shoved in a corner... not sure the theory behind that but very much disatisfactory BUT we were hungry and your food made up for the non Italian hospitality....

The young server was profesional.and did.well</text>< gmap_id>

After being seated it took a while for the server to initially visit the table. Then another long while to bring our water. The food was delicious however. We had the Fettucini Alfredo, Mediterranean Pasta, and Veal Sambocca.< /Text>

<review>My family and I had a wonderful evening at Scusa. Great service and good wine and food along with a welcoming atmosphere. We paid Scusa a visit this past Tuesday when we arrived in South Lake Tahoe and decided to dine here again last night after we had a bad experience with different local restaurant. We immediately gave Scusa a call on a Friday evening and they were able to squeeze in our party of 4 without a reservation. On the second dining experience, they didn’t disappoint and salvaged our last evening in Lake Tahoe!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80998fc2c46f8d83:0x2e507950525d9eef<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The place was very busy.  We were seated with only 5 minute wait, no reservations.  We sat outside in the lovely patio with heaters.  Very comfortable.  Service and food was excellent.  Of course they practiced social distancing.  Wonderful experience.< /Review>

The quiet cozy restaurant is the perfect place to take a date for a romantic evening out.
Each appetizer, entree, and dessert is made from scratch in-house by a chef who clearly takes time and pride in his work.
Not being in the heart of the busy South Lake Tahoe district is actually another great reason why you should make the short trip to Scusa for a quiet enjoyable evening.</review>< Pics>

We were all seated outside due to COVID regulations. It started raining, then hailing. Once the lightning began, we all were rushed inside to be re-seated. Social distancing protocols were adhered to.
Food was amazing! Service was as well.
Highly recommend eating there if you're in the area. I will definitely go again.< /Review>

<Text>If you're concerned with covid I would find an alternative. Three out of four servers assistants wore their mask with their noses exposed both days. When clean plates, water and food were served it was by someone with an exposed face. A cook came out to the restroom with their mask around their chin. Guests waiting were not asked to put on masks nor were guests when using the restroom. Someone forgot their mask and apologized and the young hostess said "it's not a big deal." But all the servers wore their masks correctly and we're very attentive and we're experienced.

No visible management, you could tell they needed help operationally. The front was typically left empty and overwhelmed.

On the other hand, the food was amazing here, five stars for food and one of the reasons I braved it a second visit. Best in Tahoe with reasonable prices and big portions. The outdoor ambiance was very nice as well. You could tell it wasn't thrown together for the pandemic but a long standing portion of the restaurant.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80998fc2c46f8d83:0x2e507950525d9eef</GmapID></record>

<review>This is not an Italian restaurant. It's an American-Italian restaurant and has nothing to do with authentic Italian cuisine. Went there twice, because I thought maybe the first time I did not eat the right entree and starter... second time, different starter and entree, same experience. Their outdoor patio is really nice though and the service is also good.< /review>< name>

<Review>The food is good and surprisingly not too heavy. It is definitely somewhat expensive, but nothing unheard of for an Italian restaurant in such an area. The bathrooms are extremely clean and nicely secluded from the dining area. The servers and bussers are very nice and overall it was a very pleasant experience. My only real gripe is that the menu is somewhat limited.</Review>< pictures>

The food was very good. It was served hot, and was seasoned appropriately. The only reason it’s getting 4 stars is the wait staff; while our waiter was very polite and courteous, he was a bit inattentive and I found myself having to call his attention on a regular basis. He checked on us maybe one time during the duration of our meal. The drinks were also a little skimpy on the ice...overall a great meal, I look forward to trying it again in the future.</text>

< Review>
The environment is good. The spaghetti tastes great. However, if you don't like sand in clams, avoid ordering anything with clams. 90% of clams in my order has sand. I beared with it for  the first two clams, but basically dumped the entire dish in the end.</Review>

< Review>
This place has nosedived recently.

Arrived 15 minutes for our reservation late due to weather issues, so understandable when asked to wait 10 minutes.

However, 25 minutes later, after listening to several complaints/conversations about how understaffed they were, we left.

Such a shame that a place like this is so mismanaged that a hostess openly complains in front of customers. Makes you doubt the quality and safety of the food.

I won't be going back. There's plenty of other quality options in South Lake Tahoe.<//Review>

The food is good and surprisingly not too heavy. It is definitely somewhat expensive, but nothing unheard of for an Italian restaurant in such an area. The bathrooms are extremely clean and nicely secluded from the dining area. The servers and bussers are very nice and overall it was a very pleasant experience. My only real gripe is that the menu is somewhat limited.</review>

< Review>
Our outdoor dining experience was exquisite - bistro lighting, soft Italian music and magnificent food! I had the Fresh Salmon Scaloppine with lemon-caper butter and linguine. Every bite was a renewed experience to my taste budds.  I couldn't get enough! The salmon was cooked to perfection. A little crust on the outside. It just melted in my mouth.

I don't normally eat all my food, but I did this time.  I just couldn't get enough of it. It's been several days and I'm still thinking about it! ❤

The setting is perfect.  The tables are kept at a great distance. The prices are great! Honestly, this is a best kept secret in South Lake Tahoe.<//Review>

<Text>We had a fairly good experience here. Service was extremely slow, but we went on an evening during Christmas week so that was to be expected.

We got a roasted garlic crostini dish as an appetizer. This was delicious.

For an entree I got the chicken linguine. The flavors weren’t bad, but there was far too much liquid in the dish.

For dessert we got coffee and tiramisu, which was pretty tasty.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3ZKZZKGrX0H_vF5AjXb5uh3PPM9RWppN8mT-2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEpZU2QOC7Z4lghtQo7Aq58Vf4uFtjWyeAxHEH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPe1N_GWjEzAVcyBTuxtqs0jhJ2FX2gvRmdyNEG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80998fc2c46f8d83:0x2e507950525d9eef< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Fantastic classic Italian cuisine. Great live saxophone and dim lighting made for a wonderful environment to eat in. The place has good decor and isn't in disrepair.

Menu is not to large which is always a good sign, and prices were good for the quality of food. Staff seemed knowledgeable of the menu and never had any issues concerning questions with recommendations.

Great find within South Lake and definitely we'll be back.<//Review>< Pics>

First time out for dinner date in Tahoe and was looking for a nice Italian restaurant happened to give this place a try and I have to say best decision ever . Great food , great service and awsome atmosphere and the live music was great, wasn't to loud so it was soothing to hear as we had our dinner . Server gave us the special for the night an we went ahead and tried the appetizer he suggested which was lobster ravioli and it was amazing ! If you're ever out in Tahoe and want an great meal Scusa is a must<//text>

<Review>I will never eat at another Italian restaurant again. Scusa fair pricing great staff. If it's on the menu get it! Because you will ne er forget it. Starters....get the Garlic cream soup! And a order of Garlic bread. I had the 14 oz steak and wife had Chicken pinata. Plus one bottle of good wine and dessert 113.00 !!! Awesome dinner and quality.< /Review>< pictures>

Fabulously awesome!   The sauces are truly out of this world!
Ask for Dale for your server.  Best waiter I've ever experienced and I'm 65.
Treat yourself to this unbelievable cuisine.</text>

< review>
It pains me to have to say this but this is one of the worst Italian restaurants I have ever encountered in my life. As a retired professional chef trained in fine dining for over 35 years I find this restaurant lacking every aspect of an Italian restaurant. Number one the food comes out cold  that’s a no-no. The chef is very heavy-handed in garlic which tends to mute the other flavors of the entrée. My   Linguine and clams had no clam flavor and the broth  Was just pure garlic and lemon juice. The veal marsala was absolutely horrible. When you ate the veal the flavor and taste of the flour came off in your mouth  A very painful experience. To call this in Italian restaurant is to slander the name of Italian restaurants. After reading many of the reviews I was hoping for an excellent dining experience but was extremely disappointed By the quality of food and the manner in which it was prepared. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone who has a sophisticated palate who knows fine dining and   Is experience in  excellent food ftom Italy this is not the place to go<//review>

Super good food, can't wait to go back. A little on the pricey side, so not a place I would go often. But a great place for special occasions<//review>

<name>Melissa Montoya<//name><Review>If you are looking for an amazing dine-out experience at South Lake Tahoe this is the spot, and I explain why I said so.
Excellent dishes!! The food here is made with lots of love, the flavor in each appetizer and entree is yummy big thanks to the chef and the amazing cooks for a delightful dinner. Omg those lobster raviolis were soooo good very nice  pasta and the sauce was very tasty, the scampi shrimp amazing as well and the Scusa garlic bread we couldn'stop ordering them we eat like 5 orders lol (thumbs up for the one that came free after yelp check in)  Also I was amazed how good the food was and the price was very very  reasonable, I wouldn't even mind pay a little more, YES it was that amazing and special!!!
The venue: It has a lovely patio seating, lighting and natural decor came to be a romanticized night for all of us. The tables are spread respecting social distancing standards, which I think it was awesome even tho being part of a tourist zone and taking all the precautions for everyone's sake it is something to applaud on these challenging times. (Not forgetting all staff members wore globes, mask, and being very careful about not stay very close to the guest. )
The STAFF: Since the moment I was making a reservation a week before I knew I was going to a nice place, the lady that took my reservation was very friendly and accommodating The day of our dinner, the host  Diana and another lady right next to her also super nice, even tho we were a little behind on our reservation they were super friendly and welcoming right when we enter the door.
Waiter IAN great service he was super super nice and profesional, he make sure we were happy refilling our waters, given also perfect timing between each course like I said even tho we were there an hour past close time, we didn't feel any kind of rush he recommend amazing specials, took our group pictures which I appreciate so much
Brandon and Tom also took care of checking on us all the time and also very friendly service.
There you have it I couldn't say even a little bad thing about this place, I can wait to come back to Tahoe and visit Scusa once again and I will tell to all my Bay Area people to do it as well if they are in the area. Grazie infinite Scusa for an unforgettable night.< /Review>< date>

<review>A very nice experience, we dined on the patio in back. I had the clams, shrimp and mussels Scuza and it was delicious. Also started with the garlic bread Scuza style, like a bruscheta with melted mozzarella, really delicious. Service was also very good, attentive staff</review><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

The Chicken Parmesan was also excellent! The portion sizes were very generous and the flavors were on point. I would say that the atmosphere could use a little refresh but overall it was excellent.<//text>< Pics>

Food was amazing and the portion size was big. They accommodate a lot of stuff on the menu and it feels pretty classy inside. The only reason I give it a 4 star is because it is pretty dark in there. So dark that my aunties and the other tables had to use their phone flashlights to read the menu.<//review>

It wasn't quite as good as it normally is. The food was ok, the service was ok just nothing like any of our past experiences when the food and service was excellent.
For as pricey as they are, one would think they would know the difference between medium and medium rare in a steak... we will give them a try again since our past experiences have all been good.<//Text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><resp>None<//resp><name>Ashi Vinod<//name><text>I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is craving for Italian food while staying in Tahoe. This place had awesome Italian pastas and the service was superb. And I really loved our waiter, he constantly checked on us and refilled our water. They gave us complimentary garlic bread. And he recommended two dishes and they were great. Loved it. I would definitely, go there again.

Parking--they have a private lot so plenty of space.

I would recommend making reservations since this place gets full easily.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80998fc2c46f8d83:0x2e507950525d9eef<//Gmap_id>< UserId.>

Staff was friendly, we were seated immediately upon arrival for our reservation. Waiter was nice and no problems with the orders, we did have to request refills on the water. All meals in our party were brought out in a timely manner and were good. No problems with any of the meals and everyone had a great time.<//review>

We had a group of 15. Excellent service, our waiter took care of everything, he asked another waiter to help when our food was served and only waited on 1 plate. We had reservations and was seated promptly. Food portions are very generous and delicious. Oh   and the dessert of hot brownie , ice cream with choc. Raspberry sauce was worth the calories!!! Our family table each took a couple of bites.< /review>

The lobster ravioli appetizer should not be missed.  Fantastic!  I had a seafood pasta dish that was also excellent.  The shrimp were perfect and the clams were the plumpest and juiciest I've ever eaten.  My wife had a chicken past dish and the chicken was cooked perfectly.  Most restaurants seem to cook chicken breast until it is dry and tasteless, but this was tender and juicy.  The decor is a bit dated, but the food is excellent.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Everything was amazing, the service was top notch with the waiter checking back regularly but not lingering or being awkward and the food was phenomenal. We ordered the artichoke and calamari appetizers, both had a unique twist to a common fare, the artichoke was especially delicious.  The entrees were brought out in perfect timing, were so delicious and the portions were more than generous.< /Text>

<text>Everything was amazing, the service was top notch with the waiter checking back regularly but not lingering or being awkward and the food was phenomenal. We ordered the artichoke and calamari appetizers, both had a unique twist to a common fare, the artichoke was especially delicious.  The entrees were brought out in perfect timing, were so delicious and the portions were more than generous.< /text>< Date>

The staff was all very friendly and professional service was fast and the food was extraordinary old world recipes had a the veal scallopini piccatta style and the pork osso bucco and both were excellent as was the bread which had just the perfect crispnessess... hat's off to the to owner and management and staff ...look forward 2 enjoying again.

One of the best 5 Italian/ Sicilian  restaurants I have had the pleasure of enjoying in California. The Spinach Pasta Mediterranean has the perfect mix of spices and ingredients. The Cannoli’s are authentic Sicilian and in my book (being Italian) are hard to come by. Definitely my new to go to when staying in Tahoe.< /Text>

Service is very good.
Food is not the best : Bread and tomato was way too big for an appetizer and a bit tasteless, while pasta dishes contain almost no pasta. If I order chicken pasta, I want pasta and not twice as much of chicken.
Prices are way too high for the quality served.</Review>

The petrali sole with it's delicious sauce is fantastic. My wife had the veal picatta and she really enjoyed it. This is the second time we ate  Scusa and will return.<//Review>

<Review>I took the first bite and for the rest of the meal I couldn't stop saying "wow" and "mmmmm" and "oh my gosh this is so goood". It was absolutely delicious. The best Italian restaurant my husband an I have been to. The lobster ravioli is to die for. Especially if you dip some garlic bread into the sauce. Yum! We are literally talking about going back there tonight.</Review>< response>

GOT HORRIBLE FOOD POISONING AFTER EATING HERE, DO NOT GO HERE!!!!! Over priced, terrible food and UNSAFE!!! There are a million other restaurants in South Lake with much better food for half the price. Do yourself a favor and avoid this tourist trap.< /Review>

The food was great our waiter was very rude and very condescending to say the least. He made our experience unforgettable in the worst way. I think it was because we had a party of 21 and the gratuity was included in the bill so he really didn't show any care. Never coming back here.</text>

I found the food to be the quintessential lowest denominator Italian food.  The burrata was “grainy” (similar to the one you can buy at the supermarket), my pasta dish was mostly chicken brest bathing in cream with almost no pasta.  I adore tiramisu and am rarely disappointed by it, but again that was subpar.  Live Jazz was a nice touch.</review><Resp>None< /Resp>< UserId.>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I dined at this restaurant two nights in a row last weekend. I am gluten free and was in great hands with the waiter. Both my husband and I had great meals. He is not gluten free. I wish I lived closer to Tahoe as I would dine here frequently. I had the polenta with chicken and artichoke's the first night. My husband had the seafood fettuchini. The second night I had gluten free pasta with fresh tomatoes and basil.</Review>< pics>

Cozy corner booths with Ted curtains for privacy!  Lobster raviolis in a seafood cream sauce that was Mana!
Wonderful staff, decent prices, outstanding garlic bread. Break scalopini was delish, and freak apparatus drizzled with perfect holindaise. Go there you'll love it.< /text>

We were hankering for Italian. It was either here or Cafe Fiore.  We chose this because it was on our way to our hotel.  I had Angel hair pasta. Tasty!  House salad was one of the best I've ever had. Wife had lasagna.  It was good. But it was only luke warm in middle. They exchanged it (one less star) but they did comp her wine. It was also our birthdays and they gave us free tiramisu and brownie with ice cream.</text>

<Time>1470256747052</Time><rating>5</rating><text>One of the best Italian restaurant experiences and food I've ever had and well worth the price. We were served warm and soft focaccia bread with oil and vinegar to start. Their Caesar salad was not as creamy as I would have liked, but it was still very tasty. The special for the day, a filet of sole over lemon caper white wine angel hair, was extremely tasty and filling. Their Alfredo sauce has an intricate and layered taste, not just the cheesy goodness in other Italian restaurants. Portions were just right. The tiramisu was lovely. If you're looking for REAL Italian food at a reasonable cost, this is the place!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<text>The staff and ambiance at Scusa Italian Ristorante was fantastic! Me and my husband wanted to celebrate a special event and they treated us like royalty.  We not only got stellar service, but the food was amazing! My husband got the SEAFOOD FETTUCCINE and I had the SHRIMP, CLAMS AND MUSSELS SCUSA.  We were both fighting over who's dish was better. Oh and we also had the GARLIC BREAD SCUSA for appetizer, again, amazing!

Anyways, I can not speak more highly of the staff and food. We will definitely be back whenever we are in South Lake Tahoe! Thank you to the staff and General Manager at Scusa, you really went above and beyond and made our night so special!< /text>< Pictures>

I had to wait for an hour to get a table, but it was worth waiting for it. I ordered a pasta with seafood (SEAFOOD FETTUCCINE) and it was delicious. Also a big meal, I was full of this together with the lovely breath with olive oil. Only thing I missed was a wifi network to use while waiting.< /text>

< Review>
Our reservation was for 730 and we arrived sooner than expected. About 45 minutes to be exact. We were took by the host that our tble was being set up. So we waited. There was no bar; however, there was a man playing his saxophone. No bar with a tiny waiting area that could open up to a more comfy, breathable area.

Once we were seated, our waiter came around 10 minutes later to serve us water and champagne. He then came back another 10 minutes later for our appetizer order. The most of the appetizers were delish. We ordered garlic cheese bread, lumaca scusa (escargot), Caesar salad and burrata. I just wish the house butter tasted better for the escargot. It was very bland. And then another 10-15 minutes after our appetizers arrived, the waiter took our entree order.

I ordered the linguine clam. That was a bust! It tasted clammy. Very bland. I even added parmesan cheese, pepper & salt to mask the flavor. I thought it would have more flavor. The clams need to be bathed in some seasoned salt, pepper, garlic, butter, chili powder and some other spices. It tasted as if the clam were taken from its container dumped into the pan with some type of watered down butter sauce and then linguine was added.

I knew I should've played it safe and gone with the spaghetti and meatballs. That is what I would recommend!!! The veal was alright. It could've been better. I should've yelped the place too and read the reviews. A major plus ia that the water refills were on point as well as the upkeep of clearing the empty plates from the table,</Review>

It was a perfect dinner from the word "go"!  best bread/olive oil I've ever tasted and 2 servings were brought.  we ordered spaghetti, ravioli, and fetticini alfredo.  all were LOVED. the greek salad was very authentic and didn't rock my socks, but that was ok.  My Chardonnay was wonderful and I was able to sample it first.  Our waiter was dynamite and very attentive.  The meal came quickly, very quickly.  Enjoyed the jazz music.</Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) A few minutes from downtown Tahoe on Route 50 is this restaurant.
We went as a family on the night of December 31 last and all the diners agreed on how good we were.
The place is very warm. With seats near the window (I recommend them); and a nice light.
The first level service. Many waiters attentive that we will not lack anything.
My daughter ate some fettuccine with cream which I tried and they were very rich.
My lady fetuccines with alfredo sauce that she said were very tasty.
In my case I ordered an exquisite lasagna with tomato sauce.
Everything was very pleasant and with more than reasonable prices for this place.
We are going back this weekend since we loved it. Before returning to our country.

A pocos minutos del centro de Tahoe sobre la ruta 50 se encuentra este restaurante.
Fuimos en familia la noche del 31 de Diciembre pasado y coincidimos todos los comensales de lo bien que pasamos.
El lugar es muy cálido. Con butacas próximo a la ventana (las recomiendo); y una luz agradable.
El servicio de primer nivel. Muchos mozos atentos a que no nos faltará nada.
Mi hija comió unos fetuccines con crema los cual probé y estaban muy ricos.
Mi Sra fetuccines con salsa Alfredo que dijo estaban muy ricos.
En mi caso pedí una lasagna exquisita con salsa de tomate.
Todo fue muy ameno y con precios más que razonables para este lugar.
Vamos a volver este fin de semana ya que nos encantó. Antes de volver a nuestro país.< /text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) The atmosphere is the highlight of the restaurant. Live music on Friday night, when I went. Menu without many options. I don't recommend the carbonara fetutine. A lot of sausage and the presentation of the dish is not pleasing to the eye. Price $$$

(Original)
O ambiente é o ponto alto do restaurante. Mûsica ao vivo na sexta æ noite, quando fui. Cardápio sem muitas opções. O fetutine à carbonara nåo recomendo. Muita linguiça e a apresentação do prato não agrada aos olhos. Preço $$$<//review>
