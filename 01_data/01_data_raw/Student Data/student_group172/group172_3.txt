They were faster than even their estimates, friendly, send text updates, and had a geico agent there. Also got my rental car there too. It's a one stop shop that made a horrible day much better. Thanks John! Did I mention they did all this during the holiday's??? They're the best!</Text>

<Name>ima filmmaker</Name><Date>1593041182419<//Date><Text>Travis helped me out. I was stuck in Bell Gardens on my birthday with a busted radiator and 20 hours away from home. Not only did Travis hook me up with amazingly fast service, he was so very kind, gave me an incredibly fair price under what I was expecting, and let me hang out in the lobby to wait. Same day. He even got me a birthday lunch. I'm from Texas, but I can't imagine that level of hospitality in the South. I was so impressed and surprised and he really helped me when I was stuck.<//Text>< gmapID>

I don't have enough space to describe the wonderful and satisfying experience I received from BB Auto Tech Repair. I was referred to his shop by America's Tire, so I've never heard from this place.
What a blessing this is. I am so immensely grateful to Mr. Travis for his honesty, integrity and generosity.
Not only did he lend me a vehicle, which he took the time to drop it at my office, while he was able to run diagnostics on the lemon car I ended up with, (no charge) invested his valuable time giving me an itemized list of needed repairs, (no charge)
He sent his employee to pick up his vehicle, brought mine back, (30 miles away) still at no charge, AND he also advised me to NOT spend ANY money on the vehicle, which would come close to 2,000.
Who does that?
A VERY HONEST, TRUSTWORTHY PERSON WHO IS CERTAINLY WORTH 10 TIMES HIS WEIGHT IN GOLD.
Any other person would have easily taken advantage of my situation, and NEVER decline a paying job neither be so generous with their time.
Now I am a loyal customer for SURE, and whenever I need service for a vehicle, I know where me, my associates, and my friends will go to.
THANK YOU SO MUCH!<//review>

<Text>The food and service is generally slow here but the service is always friendly. They have the best fish and chips around. If you like garlic, add it to your fries. They heap large quantities of fresh garlic on. Enough to repel vampires in the next 3 counties. The Chipotle aioli it's awesome also.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

For dinner I got a Cobb salad that was pretty good (with a unique jalapeño lime dressing!) and my husband got chicken strips that looked homemade and delicious. The waitresses was super friendly and gave us tips on what to see since we are from out of town. The people who run the place seem really nice as well.

I need to revisit this place and give it a second chance...I got a taster flight but didn't order food.  Beers were well crafted, but didn't thrill me. Didn't realize they had an outdoor patio until I was leaving (my fault).  The place seems popular with the locals and with that amount of loyalty, they must be doing something right.<//review>

<Text>The beers, food and service were great. I've been to several breweries where all the beers kind of tasted the same, just a small difference between them. Not here, they are truly hand crafted and taste like their given name. Bring your crowler and take some home..:P The food was equally good. The BBQ meats where tasty and salads where fresh.

<Text>Our server was very nice and helpful; we asked what was good and what we should avoid and she gave us some great choices from the menu. We ordered the house made chips and salsa; salsa was too smokey and not that flavorful and not at all spicy. The chips we amazing though they used flour tortillas and corn, very tasty! I ordered the Chicken Ranch hand sandwich and garlic fries. The chicken was crunchy but tender, very good with ranch dressing. My hubby ordered the Bleu Cheese Burger and garlic fries. The burger was clearly a cheap frozen patty that was not that good but he liked the bleu cheese on the burger. We really loved the garlic fries though; fries were crispy and the garlic was fresh. Very good! We will def come back, we live in Placerville and are always looking for a good place to enjoy lunch or dinner.</Text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>How do you screw up a hamburger?

walked in with the place 3/4 empty. Sat our self's and waited 20 minutes for our server. When she got the she seemed annoyed we were there. Ordered our drinks 3 beers and a soda. That took 15 minutes. ( Restaurant still mostly empty.) Order our 3 appetizers. Only quick thing of the night. After they got there she took our dinner order. 2 burgers nurhing complex at all. We waited 40 minutes for them. When we asked what was taking so long, she again seemed annoyed we even asked. FINALLY we get out food. The burgers though looked good. Were over cooked, smashed flat(think burger king $1 burger), bland and tasteless.

I've been here a few times in the few years I've lived local. I've never felt more like an outsider anywhere.

Without saying I will not be going back and will not be recommending this place to anyone again. Local or otherwise.</Text>< Response>

Service was ok, food ok, but they've raised their prices, and are charging a lot for everything, like a side of ranch with your fries. Or extra salad dressing.</review>

<text>Well, first time there.  You couldn't even find the fish in the fish tacos.  The chips around the tacos were stale and burned.  The wings were low average fried dry, ok , but the carrots were just plain old

Beeers so so.  Go to Jack Terrier's

The beer is good and the food is fair.  After several years of going there, I'm done!  The bar has literally been taken over by a boorish, LOUD and obnoxious patron who's always there.  When I complained that my guest and I couldn't hold a conversation due to this idiot's never ending loud and drunken sports rant, I was told that this moron brings in a lot of business.  I'd argue the opposite.  Don't bother trying to enjoy a beer there.<//review>

Worst little brew pub in america.... SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME  Should have known it was lame from the get go when we walked in and it was empty and looked like someone had converted a dentists office into a brew pub.  We ate on the patio.  I had read good reviews and had high expectations.

I never write reviews but the service and food were so awful I dont want anyone else to have to suffer through the same experience. I am amazed places like this are still in business.

Our waitress was nice enough, ordered a beer, fish and chips, which she recommended and my g/f ordered a asian salad with shrimp on top.  The waitress said they were small shrimp.  Seeing as no one was there, the food came out fast, that was the only plus.  The shrimp salad was disgusting, the shrimp were soggy and clearly on their way out.  The rest of the salad looked limp and gross, had no flavor and the "peanut sauce" was nothing more than oil and worstishire for color.

My fish and chips which claimed to be homemade, were nothing more than some frozen bs that were average at best.  And the $2 upcharge for cheese fries was just a tiny sprinkle of cheese that wasnt even melted.

As if the food wasn't bad enough our server was beyond worthless.  She clearly ignored us while she attended to a table of 4 men who looked rich.  After 30 minutes, no joke i timed it she came over and we explained how the salad was gross and she couldn't eat it.  She said sorry about the shrimp its because they cant put hot shrimp on a cold salad its illegal apparently, even though my girlfriend has been a chef for 10 years and never heard of it..... total BS.

She left, came back with the bill and had only taken off the beer instead of the salad.  I then explained to her how I was not paying for something my g/f had not eaten, the waitress said that she had eaten about half and I explained she had merely moved it around the plate looking for pieces that she might beable to eat without getting sick.

I then said I needed to see a manager about it, to which she replied I am the manager.

I was in shock and disbelief.  Not only had this "manager" ignored us completely, and given us the worst service ever she had the balls to think we might pay for this horrible food.

I made it quite clear we were not paying for the salad paid and left.  I have been in the service industry for years and have never been treated so poorly.  She would have been fired on the spot from any job I have ever had in the service industry.

I wonder how places like this stay in business..... the service was pathetic to say the least, the food was on par and the atmosphere was one step above sitting in your dentists office.  You decide..... but I wouldnt send my worst enemy there...</text>

My son came home with a terrible haircut and a shirt full of hairs. The shop was empty, you think they want to take their time and clean up the customer before leaving. Nice shop though< /review>< pictures>

If I could give it more stars I would. The guy that did my sons hair was very very patient, profesional knew how to deal with him( he had a bad experience somewhere else and hated/ feared getting a hair cut).
Definitely recommend them I am beyond satisfied with there service!<//text>

You can enjoy some good relaxation or a good game from any sport or a movie while waiting for your preferred Barber to cut your hair. It's kinda pricey but it is all worth it once you get your hair cut 💇🏽‍♂️. They have very good hair & beard product's for sale for a good price. You can also call and make an appointment. They also have a pool table, couch & chairs for you to sit on while you wait to get your haircut. The couch is also very comfy. I highly recommend you come here if you want a good haircut.<//Review>< rate>

Always very professional, fast and friendly. Never too long of a wait, and the lobby is extremely comfortable if there is one ahead of you with multiple flat screens playing the latest movies and sports. Great for the kids too!!< /Review>

Not too sure on what to say I’ve been to this shop twice and the barbers have done a good job listening to what I wanted, but this time the guy I got did what he wanted even when I showed him a picture of how I wanted my haircut to look like. It just seemed like he wanted to justify the price he charged me being $6 more then what the other barbers have charged me before. Kind of makes me think twice on coming back next time< /review>

Rarely have to wait over 10 min to get seated. Owner is always welcoming and offering an empty seat for quicker service like it should be. Cuts are quality over quantity and that's why I always leave a fair tip<//Review>

Got to the shop right at opening with no appointment but was helped by Duke right away which was nice to not have to wait.Very nice guy and the shop is very clean and has a nice set up and everything. The cut was on point most importantly. Definitely will be going back.<//Review>

<Review>This is an excellent barber shop. My barber gave me a great cut and shave. He didn't rush and still got finished in good time. The shop has eight chairs, two TVs playing sports, and a radio pumping out Power 106. The prices are competitive, they have reasonable hours, and plenty off-street parking.<//Review>< Pics>

Help me understand how your hours of operation. If your sign states that you close at 5, why is it that you close the shop at 4:40. This is not professional at all what so ever. I come here all the time and have never felt so disappointed by the team until today. I got told to come back tomorrow. What am I going to need a hair cut tomorrow for when I needed it for tonight. Deez Cutz, I will be contacting the Better Business Burea.... Oh and by the way, whistling at females when they walk by is considered harassment. Saying derogatory things about females because you think they are unattractive is unacceptable. I will be filing a formal harassment complaint against with the city against you guys as well.<//Text>

<review>This barber shop was decent a couple months ago. Now, they seem to have lost the friendly environment feel. Too many sketchy looking men there just hanging out. And to top it off the past 2 cuts there were f'd up... the fade was uneven and they didnt cut it as we explained.</review>< pictures>

<review>Didn't seem like they wanted to work over there,I roled up and the closed sign was still up, someone had to come back and  call me back to the door .then after asking what i wanted for my son's hair cut I was told by the barber that he could not do that for me .not only did that upset me ,I had to hear another barber talk about how good he is at doing special designs but did not feel like doing it .I felt rushed  and it didn't seem like anybody wanted to work.i would never go that again or recommend them<//review><userid>114016525478201458397< /userid></record>

I was coming through town on a road trip when I noticed my car sounding different! I called to see if they could check out my car and they squeezed me in and had everything fixed in no time. They were so very kind and helpful. Cant thank them enough for their service!</text>

<Text>Jay could not have been more understanding and supportive. We were 3000 miles from home, had a failed Y pipe that I had safety wired in Boise to get to Crescent City, but was failing and melting our van bumper. We were due to leave the next day. The great folks at Two Guys welded a new y pipe in and even changed the oil, all while I waited. Meeting Jay and his crew a true blessing as traveling strangers.< /Text>< name>

We broke leaf springs on our trailer outside Crescent City. Had to order parts from the Midwest. As soon as the parts arrived, they worked us into their busy schedule and got us on our way. Jake and Mike and their crew were outstanding. We would be happy to do business with them again.< /Review>

2 Guys Auto mounted a hitch receiver on the front of my truck. I called quite a few shops that were booked out way in advance, and even more that never returned my calls before I found this shop. They were friendly and did great work, plus they didn’t charge me for the additional labor hours when my appointment took longer than expected. I’d definitely recommend this place!< /Review>

<text>We are on vacation with our motorhome. The tail pipe got smashed pulling into a parking lot (curb was closer than we thought). We were afraid to drive it with the tailpipe pinched shut, so we came to Two Guys. They immediately assisted us. They were very helpful,  pleasant and kind. A HUGE thank you to these guys! I would recommend them anytime!</text>< Pics>

Very good pricing.
But Could not figure out the issues i was having with my vehicle and told me they were out of ideas.
I had to return the vehicle multiple times after they said it was fixed, They replaced parts that did not need to be replaced and even broke my driver door handle and neglected to tell me.
If you want cheap affordable auto repair this is the place to go but my experience was not good.< /text>

<Review>So disappointed in this place. We’ve taken multiple vehicles here for muffler work. And all times the welds did not hold and he did not do accurate work but charged the same. My boyfriend even had to crawl under there to show him.

Well recently we took another vehicle there (when I requested we find somewhere else) to get muffler work. He quoted me a price and we ended up paying way more than the quote. For the same amount of time.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Date>1579657746543< /Date><user>105113609726305810969< /user><user_name>heather clutts< /user_name>< Rating>

The guy working there took the time to drive my vehicle/trailer around town with me in the vehicle to explain the problem I was having, and when he determined it was an issue they couldn’t fix he actually drove me straight to a different shop (and went into the other shop to talk to the other mechanics) so that I would get service right away. Charged me nothing for all the help. Super thankful!!</Text>< pictures>

< review>
We were traveling from Michigan and about 3,600 miles into our road trip. Had power steering fuse blow and managed to make it into crescent city. We went to 4 other auto parts stores, including the GMC dealer ship and were told they couldn't help us, being lack of parts and on the weekend. Found our way to Two Guys, and the friendly staff took care of us quickly and efficiently. They were the nicest people we've met in California so far and only charged us for parts. The experience was extremely relieving and we are so darn grateful for their assistance. Happy to have been treated so well, especially after all the miles and questionable city surroundings here. Thank you guys so much for getting us back on the road, you all rock and saved us!<//review>

Would have been way less if lunch hadn't fallen within that time. Price was reasonable and the staff were the best! We definitely recommend them!< /review>< response>

<review>I cannot fully express how well these folks treated me. I was in a bind when my alternator quit on me while I was on a very lengthy road trip. It was Friday when I realized my car was going to break down at any second (Friday is not the day you want to break down in a small town), but these people helped me and I was back on the road in under two hours. They are an honest, kind, and fair business.</review><userid>107141269682605957832< /userid><resp>{'time': 1570461871096, 'text': 'So glad we could help you continue on your trip.

<review>The best service I have EVER received from a shop. When is the last time you were able to call a shop, get in with in half hour and be charged reasonably? I can't say enough good things about Two Guys! From the sweet young lady that answered the phone to the friendly gentleman at the counter to the knowledgeable mechanic that did the work, I am so grateful this kind of service is still out there! Being in town for the Jaycee tournament, over 4 hours away from home, things could have gone bad, lucky for me I called Two Guys Automotive!</review>< Rating>

These guys can do anything!  I needed a handicap scooter lift installed in the back of a Subaru Forester.  They did the job perfectly and at a reasonable price.  No more awkward ramps needed.  The electric hoist is solidly mounted and lifts a 300 pound scooter in and out easily.  Thanks 2-guys!< /text>

Two guys saved me on a Saturday!!! The powersteering fuse blew on my vehicle. I was traveling through town, a long ways from home. I tried stopping at the dealership and o Riley, and called Walmart and autozone, with no luck. Two guys immediately took my car back, called around for the fuse I needed, proceeded to go pick it up, and installed it for me. All for only 8$ They were incredibly friendly and helpful. Let me stand inside their garage out of the rain while waiting. Couldn’t be more appreciative of their service!!!</text>

<Review>Because of them my dog fell several feet onto his back onto the ground. If you don't have a dog you may be able to get away with a few day rental. Otherwise they tried to ruin my life my finances and my reputation. I almost lost my job because of their extraordinary demands. It was bizarre. Perhaps my opponents paid them to deliberately harm me. Very strange.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Had a bad run of luck and broke a strut on our truck, limped back into Crescent City and took it to Two Guys. They were very quick and efficient and ordered the part and slotted us into there busy schedule which was very appreciated. Got us back on the road as quickly as possible. Highly Recommended.< /Text>

Had a noise in my front right tire
,of which Two Guys told me
'he couldn't hear it yet, drive it a lil longer til I can tell what it is.
So I drove it til really loud. Was told by Two Guys it was probably this or that and would cost $125 without even putting it on a lift to look at it.
So I got a second opinion in Brookings at Les Schwab, got it on a lift, found out exactly what it was and replaced for less than $100 Yay!</text>

I was passing thru the area with my motorhome and tow jeep and discovered my jeep had a coolant leak.  I looked them up on the Internet and contacted them on my way into town.  They took me right in and discovered my water pump needed to be replaced.  They got me in and out within two hours and back on the road.  All at a great price too. Highly recommend this shop to anyone.</text>

<review>We had an issue with our RV. We called at least 8 auto / truck repair shops and they were all busy. Mike from TWO Guys was too but he accepted to come to the place we were stuck, have a look, reference us a towing company and finally work on it. Thanks guys, we are back on the road<//review></record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>This shop is AMAZING! While driving our motorhome on vacation the motorhome developed a nasty exhaust leak. It was unbearably loud. I was concerned it would be very expensive and difficult to fix. I took it to Jay at 'Two Guys' and he had it fixed and back on the road with a custom muffler repair in an hour while my family and I had lunch at Pizza Hut across the street. On top of that he only charged me $90!!  They took a problem that could have made our vacation very uncomfortable and totally remedied it!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

< Review>
This will be my initial review of the sound system Audiotistics installed in my car.
From the first day they installed it I could tell this was gonna to be amazing to listen to everyday. They even installed it the same day! I got a subwoofer, 4 new door speakers, tweeters, an amplifier, and a new touch screen stereo all for a very fair price. Thank you Tim for explaining everything and making it an easy process. If I have any future upgrades I will certainly be returning to Audiotistics.< /Review>

Tim and his crew are the "Best in Class" in the mobile audio market.  I've followed their business for a long time and finally took my car to get my stereo "upgraded".  From my initial meeting with Tim to design my system, to my interactions with Nestor, my experience exceeded my expectations.  My system is awesome.  The install team did a great job.  I will be back and I will highly recommend them to anyone who wants the quality work and experience that is consistent with "Best in Class" service.</review>

This shop blows the other shops away.. Andy, Nester were very thorough and patient with all my questions.. I can see why their reviews are so high.. They went above and beyond with making sure I was happy.. Jay was my tech who did my alarm install and was also very patient and thorough with explaining how everything worked on my alarm.. He also went above and beyond.. I will definitely be going back to this shop for any kind of upgrades.. I give these guy's 10 stars.. Thanks again guy's on an amazing install..< /text>

I was traveling through the area from Denver, and had a blown speaker on my bike. Tim called Rockford fosgate, (whose service was also amazing),  swapped out all of my speakers when it turned out all of them were blown, And got me back on the road within an hour. I can't say enough how great their customer service was, And how everybody involved on their team was helpful friendly and efficient. Props to Tim and audiotistics, great shop!!!<//review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>An overdue review. I want to thank everyone there at Audiotistics and Nestor for helping me out with the Viper installation and how it functions. I would also like to thank him for going above and beyond in looking for a replacement Infotainment System for my 2020 Honda HRV, but I'm starting to doubt that there will ever be anything. My next upgrade will be to my speakers since my infotainment system is out of the question 😂.

Thank you guys again, until next time.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1622915264186, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the feedback! 😁'}</Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>This review is long overdue. My new JBL speakers and tweeters and JL Audio sub  sounds really good in my Nissan 370z. Installation was super clean. The customer service is by far the best I've seen anywhere else. The owner Tim, Nester, Andy, and the dude with a superman face cover (sorry bro forgot your name) are top notch. I would highly recommend this place to my friends and family. Thanks fellas!</Review>< time>

<Text>I’m not originally from the area and rely heavily on online reviews to find local places for almost everything... THESE HIGH GOOGLE REVIEWS DO NOT LIE, THESE GUYS ARE AMAZING!

I was looking to update the stereo in my 2009 toyota along with a rearview camera. I walked-in and was greeted with hospitality and was assisted with my needs without trying to oversell anything. I got my car back with the new installations same day.

I am falling in love with my car’s new upgrade and just looking forward to driving now- CANT STOP SMILING! 😁

Thank you Andy and Nestor for assisting me today and to the guy who added the-usb port feature to connect apple play directly! (I don’t think i got your name)

Proof that this store has wonderful crew and why people keep coming back here... you’ve earned yourself a new patron. :)

You guys are definitely worth the price!

Look no further for your audio needs!< /Text><Name>Marianelle Lapingcao<//Name>< Time>

The whip lights that they put on are the 5150 and I have never seen them on a Chevy Silverado but they figured out how to put it on my truck plus they did a super job. I posted the pictures if you see the grey Silverado at night with all the lights on so you can see the great job they did and affordable.< /Review>< date>

This is a review I'm proud to write. Nestor and his team, along with Tim the owner are incredible. Had a busted horn and they figured out the issue and fixed it... FOR FREE. Probably saved me $300 on a trip to the dealership. Awesome radio, amps, speakers, sound. You guys are the best and I can't wait to come back. Thanks again!< /review>

<Review>Great place to get a car stereo!  They won't try to push you into buying something. They are friendly and patient and once in while will crack a joke with you. they are honest with you and won't try to get you to buy more then you need. although it was my first time buying a stereo I left feeling Satisfied. I did install my stereo on my jeep on my own however, they have a service where they will install it for you!

Great Place!<//Review><username>Jake Kelerno</username>< time>

Hands down the best Audio shop I’ve ever been to. Down to earth staff and extremely knowledgeable. Nester made sure I got exactly the sound I was looking for in my 14 accord. On my initial visit he showed me a variety of component speakers and also let me hear them play before I made a decision which most shops up here will not care to do! The installation Came out super neat and clean and I couldn’t be happier. Thanks again to Tim and the Audiotistics crew!<//text>

Very excited with the way my subs came out, came in with my own speakers and amp they hooked them up amazing. My amp wasn’t working and they let me know and offered to hook up a new amp same day or the next. Amazing staff! 10/10 would recommend bringing your car here for the best results.<//Text>

This was My first time to the store but won't be My last one.
Great atmosphere, went there to install a Car alarm
even though I didn't purchase the alarm from them dint push to buy any upgrade or another alarm,
I wish I knew Audiotistic before I install my system in my car.
But I know Il be coming here for any future audio system and alarm.
Thank you Nestor and Team.
The alarm and Remote start works great.< /review>

Tim and his team are exceptional! They were able to deliver and a build a system to my liking beyond my expectations. The staff is very knowledge and professional and friendly ,these guys  know what they are doing. While I was there for a sound system , I decided to get a Viper alarm also. The audio system and  alarm were completed the same day with electronic locks installed also! Thanks Audiotistics for the amazing job keep it up< /Text>

To start off this I am a real person and this is not a fake review. I called audiotistics Wednesday evening in regards to my new headlights I installed not functioning and completely shorting, and blowing fuses left and right. I spoke with Tim, he was very professional and courteous of my situation. I couldnt make it due to work but when I arrived the next day I was greeted, taken care of and was told "make yourself at home we have coffee cookies and chips". I was very stressed because of no lighting on my 2006 Toyota Tacoma. Immediately they knew what was wrong and started fixing my truck. They didnt even take out the headlights or taillights and made everything function properly. The price is fair and I will continue to go with Audiotistics since they specialize in infotainment and aftermarket lighting. Thank you gents for making my day way better.</Review>

One of the best experiences I’ve ever had in an audio shop. Nestor and Tim took care of me and made me feel welcome while also educating me on what I needed and why it would be better in my situation. Definitely professional staff and high quality products will be coming back whenever I need any audio assistance.<//review>

Audiotistics is a professional and reliable place the owner looked at my truck and had my amp and sub bumping  in under 10 minutes . He didnt even charge me because it was such an easy fix. This place is great it will be the only place I go to from now on for all my stereo needs!<//Text>

The shop is very friendly and they know exactly what they are talking about. Had the privilege of getting a tour of the shop when I first got there and seen some of the custom work they were working on. Nestor helped out with all the details and made sure to keep me up to date on me picking up my truck. The system sounds down right nasty! The thump in the truck was way more than what I expected and the clarity from my highs is beautiful. All in all an amazing shop with professional workers and great environment.

These guys know what they are doing, the customer service and quality of their work is the best I’ve experienced.  I took my 2017 F250 Platinum to have them go over a full DIY sound system upgrade and to have the system properly tuned. I had the privilege to have Tim (the owner) tune my system and the results of his work blew me away.  Car audio tuning is an art and I got to say, Tim is the best!!!! These guys are professionals, their quality of work, dedication and customer service will exceed any expectations. Thanks Tim ! You guys are awesome !

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Outstanding workmanship.. I was very nervous to have a sound system put in my canam X3 because my husband has a stereo put in his Maverick  from a big store down the hill, I wont name any names ... and it shorts out the light bar. My brother referred me over to Audiotistics and I had it installed. OH MY GOODNESS!!! It sounds amazing and I have NOT had any issues. After my X3 was finished we took our boat in and have my husbands car scheduled to be truly custom installed. Thanks a bunch Audiotistics for taking pride in your work.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< gmapID>

Tim and the guys were a huge help cause I know next to nothing about car audio..they helped me get what I needed at a great price.

Went out of his way to make sure i got the right deal and got everything i needed. Would definitely recommend him to help the next person. To top it off merchandise expectations exceeds what I had in mind.
Been A Year Since I Came An Got My System Done I Called In Said I Was Experiencing Some Issues And Was Told Bring It In They'll Get It Fixed No Questions Asked. This Spot Sells Top Notch Quality, The Service Is Even Better And They Always Stand By Their Work. I've Always Been Taken Care Of Real Good When I Come To Audiotistics. Definitely Coming Back For My Next Upgrade.<//text>< Rate>

I needed a 2-way Viper install. Wes was able to answer all my questions and set up a Saturday install. He walked me through all the features and wired them up - remote start, alarm, remote locks. Clean work. While I was there I talked to Tim about sound upgrades and adding an aux input to my factory stereo. Reasonable rates. Tim has 24 years in the industry and is highly knowledgeable. This shop does a lot of custom fabrication and high end audio. They also sell some pre-fab specialized boxes for speakers and woofers that are vehicle specific space savers. Will be back again - for audio next time. Thanks!< /review>

Too Expensive, i research everything before i buy, i had an idea of what i wanted but i decided to let the guys at audiotistics put together an estimate and recommendation. i was greeted and the salesman was very knowledgeable seemed like a go until i noticed one of the items a lot higher priced than i seen online so i asked if i can take a look at the quote. every item was like $100-140 more than Crutchfield and Amazon, i could save borderline $600-840 buying all items online so i asked can i provide the gear? at that moment the salesman seemed angered or offended and all professionalism went out the window, he started telling me he needs to make a living, i understand we all need to make money but double charging me on items and still charging a labor fee no THANK YOU. i'll keep shopping around. an idiot is born everyday but i'm not one of them.</text>

I went in for just information and a quote and got the information I requested. No pressure tactics whatsoever. It was a very good experience. When I get ready to upgrade my radio to Bluetooth I will be going back.</Review>

Tim was down to earth, honest and sincere in analyzing my needs. He took time to detail out a few options for my build which were quite reasonable. This shop is legit. Don't take the risk of going to a questionable shop to save a few dollars now when it could negatively affect you down the road. Will be back soon for install. Thanks Audiotistics.</review>

Friendly staff, excellent service and great food if you happen to catch the tomale lady when she stops by. They only sell the best brands, but do have budget friendly options. They also offer multiple payment options for those that are the void of cash, so don't let that stand in the way. I'd definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the market for car audio upgrades.< /Text>

<Review>I was having some issues with a pre installed Rockford Fosgate Amplifier on my 2018 Roadglide. I brought my motorcycle here because they are on the Rockford Fosgate list of installation and repair shops.
The customer service at this shop is way above any other audio shop I ever visited. I asked them a lot of questions about the unit I had installed and they answered them all without any hesitation. I knew right then that these guys were on top of their game.
Wesley, the motorcycle technician, did a through inspection of the Fosgate unit. I was having issues with the reception on the Harley Radio. He found issues with the antenna plug and repaired it accordingly. He also did a system diagnostic on the amp. He downloaded the most recent Rockford Fosgate settings and reset the amp for the best archivable sound. The sound I have now is great and the radio reception is better that ever.
I also got to meet Tim the owner of the shop. He is a great guy and knows his business well. I was fortunate to get a shop tour and see everything that they offer to their customers. I highly recommend using this shop for all audio needs, especially on motorcycles. They offer very competitive pricing on their Audio units and installation.

Remember, If you think its expensive to hire a professional,
Wait until you hire an amateur.

Thanks again Tim and Wesley</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Had a Viper remote system installed in my 2017 corolla, everything was great with installation and the crew was friendly. The viper system started to malfunction about a month afterward so I took it into them, no questions asked they took a look at it and switched it out at no cost to me. Awesome place, highly recommend.< /review>

After having my system done twice at two different shops, with disappointing results, I was recommended to Tim at audiotistics. After meeting Tim I knew I had the right shop, he took the time to talk to me and understand was I was looking for out of my system. He went over my system in detail and explained what was wrong with it, and how they were going to fix it. After touring his shop and seeing the quality of work they were turning out, I had no doubt I was dealing with a true professional. These guys take there work seriously, the pride they take in there work really shows, and there customer service is second to none, they will not let you leave there shop until you are completely satisfied. Once I picked up my car I was blown away by the performance of my system and the quality of work. The routing of my wiring was very professional, and looked factory. They even swappeded out the wrong screws the previous shop had used. Tim spent nearly an hour with me showing me how to operate my new system properly, and how to get the most performance out of it. I never once felt rushed. The craftsmen ship of the sub enclosure was beautiful, and perfectly matched my interior. I never would have thought that I could get such a high level of musical quality out of my system, especially at such a reasonable cost, and it was well worth the two hour drive from my house to his shop I had to make. These guys are true professionals and if you choose to work with them, you will be simply blown away. Thanks Tim ! You guys are awesome !<//review>

Audiotistics is a place where you can not only get some of he best and most personalized customer service but you will also get premium products with out the run around, along with truly professional installation that doesn't require someone else to fix it later.  I was able to walk in and describe what I wanted and Audiotistics was able to bring my idea to life but only make it better and give me a truly custom job.  I would recommend to anyone who is looking for car audio whether it is something simple or something completely custom.  This is an an all in one shop!</Review>

So I had to get my radio fixed because someone stole it, I went  to Toyota dealership to get a price on what it would cost to fix the radio the air-conditioning the heater so forth.   It was well over $5000 so Toyota dealership referred me to a company audiotistics;  Who was such a blessing in my life they not only fix my car fixed the air conditioning fixed the heater got everything all set replaced fuses for me got me a new radio and repaired it for less than $800.   If you want to look for a reliable radio repair replace company I recommend audiotistics to the fullest.   God bless< /Review>

It's always THE BEST EXPERIENCE when a shop takes a genuine interest and concern towards your new install. AUDIOTISTICS, by far, exceeded all of my expectations whilst purchasing new car audio equipment. No company, before them, has been more KNOWLEDGEABLE, DETAILED, HONEST & UPFRONT with me in every aspect of my sale. I feel I not only was given a damn good deal, but also, was introduced to like-minded audiophiles who share the same passion for that quality, clean, and booming sounds. Thanks again AUDIOTISTICS! SEE YOU SOON.</review>

<Review>The techs were professional, helpful and knowledgeable.  The site unseen (over the phone) quote was exactly what I paid.  No surprises!

Second to none customer service.  I went in to purchase speakers and a head unit for my boat.  I planned on doing the install myself, since on my boat everything is very accessible and simple to get to.  Tim was extremely helpful and took his time getting to know what I wanted in the sound system for my boat and suggesting the lowest cost option that would work for my needs.

When I tried to fit the speakers into the dash area they collided with the windshield as they would not sit all the way into the hole that was there from the previous speakers.  Tim went out of his way to have one of his techs pull out an air tool and make the hole larger, right then and there.  I never would have imagined a car stereo business to be so friendly and helpful, but this place surpassed all expectations.

If you are anywhere in the high desert needing a car stereo, and want to be treated with dignity an respect, I do not think you will find a better place than this.<//Text>

You know sometimes it's not all just about the work - even though Audiotistics' work is amazing. Sometimes it also the personal connection you make with people, you know like the old days when companies actually cared about their customers. Tim was there for me the entire way, never made me feel like I was stupid for not knowing something simple about audio. He took great care of my car and still to this day is making sure I am happy and will continue to be happy. I feel I made a friend and will definitely stop by to just say hi and see how he and Wes are doing even when they aren't working on my cars. Do yourself a favor and let Tim and Wes be apart of your audio build, you will not regret it for a second!!</review>

The staff here is so helpful, they were very profesional, knowledgeable, and courteous.  I came here looking for a part, and they ended up, showing us how to save money by using our old brackets. They cut away at the side (a small portion) of the stereo bracket so that it would fit our new stereo unit. They had a universal kit. That they could of sold us. So I appreciate they're honesty. Will remember this place for any future work.</text>

<text>Tim, Will and the rest of the crew were most helpful!  It took me a couple visits to decide on the alarm package I wanted, but they were their to answer all my questions.  Not once did I feel that they were short or impatient in any way.  When I decided on the alarm package that was right for me, they did not try to force any other package on me.  They knew I had processed all the information and came to a final decision.  This is a very professional, clean and fun shop to do business in.  When the time is right, I will definitely be back so they can install a stereo system in my truck.  If you are considering an alarm, tracking device or a bumpin stereo system, I highly recommend Audiotistics.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rating>

So I just into the shop to get new door speakers. I wish I knew the guys name but he was very knowledgeable.  I bought the speakers and he let me test a sub woofer then he said let me tune ur amps. Then he said that the speakers were wired wrong by another shop, he then fixed the wiring and then tuned the amps at no charge to me. The man is very passionate about his work. I will be going back for sure. Thanks guys<//review>

<Review>Drove down from Las Vegas specifically for Tim and his guys at audiotistics. I literally cannot say enough good things about this company. Tim is a true entrepreneur and a genuine guy and has an ever better business! This is not your normal audio shop, as soon as you walk in to the showroom you’re just blown away by how clean, organized, and professional everything looks and that’s how you make a great first impression. Audiotistics has far superior quality of workmanship than any other audio shop easily. Everyone there is extremely knowledgeable and friendly. I had a box made, tweeters installed, and had my wiring cleaned up and everything far exceeded my expectations. I wish there was a shop in vegas but i know without a doubt this business will expand, it has every ingredient to take over the audio business nationwide! This is just a place you have to see to believe. Thanks to everyone at audiotistics you guys are awesome!< /Review>< pictures>

Great service. I went to 3 different shops in HD and they didn't know what was the problem with my system. I went to audiotistics and I didn't even wait for them to help me out walked in and they fixed my system and explained what was wrong. I highly recommend this place.</Review>

Tim is an honest person which puts the cherry on top. He makes great recommendations and once again PERFECT work.

<time>1516495860879</time><review>Wether you are looking to upgrade your daily driver or you want your neighbors to hear you coming down the road a few blocks before you arrive, this is definitely the place to go. I had literally been going to shops all over SoCal prior to stumbling across with Audiotistics, and I couldn't be any more happier as a loyal customer. Thanks to their customer service, hospitality, knowledge and to their ability to hear out the customer's needs and give them the best of what they want vs "upselling" to me earns my business each time. Quality of the work is incredible like I mentioned earlier I had been to various shops SEVERAL TIMES to get "mistakes" fixed , not here these guys guarantee their work and out of not 1 not 2 not 3 but 6 vehicles I have brought to them ( all different builds) I have not had an issue with any one of them, on the flip side if there were anything wrong I know I can come back and the issue would be resolved no problem. Aside from the team knowing what they are doing the custom fabrication work is out of this world, YES they fabricate if not all  l, they fabricate the majority of their work (unless one decides to go with a pre-fab) but literally all the work is to the customer's request. I gave Audiotistics a 5 star because this didn't allow for me to go any further but if you are looking for an honest dollar per dollar place to go look no further I learned that from day 1 that I came with these guys and they'll remain my #1 spot thank you Audiotistics!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

<Review>Best Stereo Shop in High Desert. Literally have wasted over a thousand dollars on poorly installed equipment from vip tint and audio (horrible customer service there btw) and LA Stereo.  (Good customer service bad work) So I just got a new Titan and wanted it done right so I gave these guys a shot because when I went into there showroom they actually had good product like Rockford fosgate and jl instead of some cheap pheonix gold speakers. . Got there at 4 they close at 6 but still took the job and stayed open an extra 2 hours to get the job done. They had to take the head unit and amp out of my suv run new wire  mount subs and install a back up cam and all new door speakers last minute and did it without even a complaint they were actually more than happy to. Then when I finally got it , it was tuned perfect . Literally 10 out of 10 stars for this place. On top of everything the price was great for the work done and will not be going ANYWHERE else in the desert.< /Review>< pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>My Name Is Skip Banks,

I'm an entertainer and I have a mobile sound system on a rolling cart that Tim and his crew have done work on in the past.
I perform a musical comedy show with this portable music station.
This past Memorial day weekend I was performing in the Victorville California  area and  my mobile sound system completely stopped working in the middle of a show as at least two hundred people were all around me watching this insane show I perform.

I thought it was just over heating  so I tried it the next morning and it still didn't work.
I really didn't want to call so early but I had a show in 5 hours to do.I did manage to locate Tim (The Owner of Audiotistics ) and he was out of town up North of Victorville I suspect fast asleep at 7 am in the morning  but the guy took the time to communicate with me and after some trouble shooting he got it fixed for me as it turns out it was the large 60 amp fuses that were probably 5 years old that needed replaced.

You can't find this type of service nowadays. I highly recommend Audiotistics in Victorville California .
There not like the other Audio shops with those dudes at shops with there attitudes and over pricing. There the real definition of  customer service just like back in the ol days.

1,000 Stars for Audiotistics

I did a little research before i came here and was really impressed with the work and reviews so I decided to come down from orange county (1hr 45min drive) had my alarm installed and im glad i came here had 3 different shops work on my truck and all failed miserably, Audiotistics stands by their name! Theres a reason they have 5 stars! The guys provided excellent  customer service spoke with Richard, the manager and got hooked up!! Not only did i get a great quote but they took the time to give me a demo from their  Audiotistics van, even though they were busy, got to meet Tim truly an awesome businessman has a great passion for his work and known in the industry, when i had everything installed they didn't mind me hanging in the back other shops would kick you out or get mad thinking you might see how poorly their installation work is i was really impressed how they took the time to test and solder wire by wire to make sure everything worked like the way it's supposed to West did an extremely great job even stayed after hours with richard just to finish my setup! They really did go above and beyond making sure everything worked and was perfect  i will be truly coming back when i go big nd have my custom fabrication work done by Tim and his Team! Thanks Audiotistics!!< /text>

<Text>Went here today to get an install on my new 2015 Sentra. Met and spoke with Richard and Tim, and both gentlemen were profressional and knew their ish. Devin was the man that did the install, and his work was flawless. No shown wires, no damage to anything within the car where he worked, and even let me assista on little things(I like to help out haha). Great price for the install, and got me back on the road in no time. Was my 1st shop in the high desert I went to(I usually do my own work), and will for sure be the only shop that I attend for future work, and will recommend this shop if anyone will need a recommendation to get work done. Keep it up fellas... Much Love</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>I must say that in all my years of listening to music and the quality sound, I have never experienced getting my car audio done, and don't have to go back because it just doesn't sound right.. Well not here the guys at audiotistics were Phenomenal.. Rich was a big help in helping me choose what was best.. And it felt real good to know thst the Owner Tim spent special time to customize my subwoofer box... I dont ever want to get out of my truck... This work was done with love and affection and we need more companies and people like that in our world. . If I can give them a million stars I would.. I will and I do recommend this Audio Spot to anybody who loves great music in their vehicle... As far as I'm concerned their is no one that can do what Audiotistics did to my truck... It has changed her life for ever... Thanks guys for helping and caring I wish you guys much more success and Money... Always a pleasure to be apart of something so wonderful... Get on board and get yah vehicle banged out you won't regret it... I sure didn't..... MELODY......</text>< pictures>

Great variety of donuts and the more you buy, the more you save.
They also offer coffee and other breakfast snacks so you can come in and  enjoy a coffee seating down before work or something. Parking can be an issue when all the other businesses are busy just, be patient.< /review>

<Review>It's hard to dislike a donut shop. The service was quick and the donuts were excellent...my son ordered the green tea glazed while I preferred plain ones to accompany the coffee.  I was, however, disappointed that cake donuts were not offered.<//Review>< gmapID>

Awesome donuts and staff. This place will entice and trap you. I came in thinking of getting 6. Was asked "how can I help you?" I asked for 12 donuts without much thought. DELICIOUS!< /Review>

These 🍩 donuts are fantastic! They were fresh and had a great selection even at 10:30AM. The ham, bacon, egg, and cheese on a begal breakfast sandwich was really good too. We will definitely come back whenever we are in the area.<//review>

I went early in the morning  about 6:00 am. The building was very clean and the staff were masked. The service I received was excellent  and I noted that their donut shelves were stoked. Oh by the way the breakfast sandwiches I ordered were fantastic!< /Review>

I came in for 2 dozen donuts for my nurses and  doctors at the hospital on my unit and the nice lady hooked me up with more then 2 dozen. She even gave my baby a free croissant sandwich, banana and donut holes. Great customer service and I love there donuts as well! Kids eat free 8am to 12pm 13 and under.< /Text>

The 2 gals that were there were very nice. Both smiled and said hi. Which in today's day and age is to me a big deal. The donuts are fresh and delicious. The strawberry and blueberry frosted raised were awesome. They were frosted generously but the rest of the donut is unglazed. So for those of us that really enjoy diabetes and go for it in life, how about raised glazed WITH the strawberry or blueberry frosting. I think that would be awesome! I would eat 4 of those no problem and then just.....sleep it off in the parking lot. Either way I'm coming back</review>

Went last night for a half dozen, everything looked soo good. I thought about getting a dozen to try different ones but realized I was on my motorcycle so I had to decide which 6 to get. The lady working there was kind and patient with me explaining which donuts had what as I pointed at them. When I got home I open the bag to find 8 donuts, she was so generous to throw in 2 free donuts. I will definitely be back soon to try the other donuts I didn't pick LOL P.S. the glazed had just barely came out (which she had mentioned to me) I told her to throw one in the bag as the last donut so it wouldn't get all squished. It was better than Krispy Kreme, I would definitely buy a dozen glazed and find a way to strap it onto my motorcycle LOL<//Review>

I usually enjoy the donuts but the last 2 times I've been there they have given me stale hard donuts.  When I asked of they were fresh she said yes they are fresh we made them this morning.. It was about 10pm when I went.< /text>

<Text>So good... decent prices, very nice customer service and overall one of the best donuts I've ever had. They have donut holes that are stuffed with Bavarian cream or raspberry filling. Or just plain glazed they are all good.</Text>< pics>

The donuts here are out of this world. I have been coming here for years and the thing that stands out most is CONSISTENCY. These little sweets are always rich and yummy. The building is A bit rundown and depressing but one bite of these tasty treats and you won't even notice< /text>

Selection was not as good as it use to be.  Too hot for coffee so can't tell you how good or not it was.  Also, one of the ladies on the counter was being uber nice to guy but was ignoring me.  The Hispanic lady that works there is always nice to everyone that is why I gave it a three stars and not two stars.< /Text>

I just moved in the neighborhood, went with a friend to check it out.  The girl and the lady at the counter last night, were very nice.  The tuna croissant sandwich was delicious.  The strawberry powderfilled donut reminds me of the wonderful hostess rasberryjellyfilled powdered donuts when I was little.  The cinnamon powdered donuts and coffee was scrumptious.  Sunny donuts national city and Chula Vista will be my go to place for coffee and donuts.</Text>

Good place to grab a doughnut. Breakfast is a little expensive, but it's good. The coffee is always strong and hot. All they need is a TV with the news on.<//review>

During the trip, I went to eat breakfast at 6:00.
All the donuts were delicious.
My favorite is BlackBerry Jelly Donuts ♪
The coffee was so good that I went there for two days in a row!
I want to go again.

24時間営業しています。
旅行中、朝ごはんを食べに6:00に行きました。
ドーナツはどれも美味しかったです。
私のお気に入りはブラックベリージェリードーナツ♪
コーヒーもとても美味しくて2日間連続で行ってしまいました！
また行きたいです。<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbXg0Qjc1-jphLi8cmemZU1AquE3_OWp4xbHtO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvaC2OFA1G1Q418w6moP-rljS4bMLo9SBmlz0x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNchgY5aCN2XvyRFtaYGeGu__oE4h7p-cUAkp0p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

(Translated by Google) For years I have come to this establishment because of its quality of donuts and its customer service, but today I went at about 7 at night and a girl was very badly faced. Nothing to do with the ladies who always welcome you by saying hello and with a smile they shouldn't have bitter staff

(Original)
Por años eh venido a este establecimiento x su calidad en las donas y su servicio al cliente pero hoy fui como a las 7 de la noche y estaba una muchacha muy mal encarada. Nada que ver con las señoras que siempre te reciben saludando y con una sonrisa  no deberían tener personal amargado</Review>

What an experience!  It is casual, almost like attending a dinner at a private residence. Everything is well curated, from napkin to tableware.  Service is very top notch and food is also amazing. Great spot for a casual date or wine tasting with business partners.<//review>

This was one of my favorite dining experience s of my life. So good. You have to make a reservation, but take the time, so good.</Review>

Realized that I've never posted my review about that place. Well one the greatest chef ever. Everything that she does is amazing. If you want some light bites and treat yourself without going for the full meal, this is the place to go.<//Review>

<Review>Just insanely good and unmatched: the setting is surreal and soothing, the service is better than any 3* restaurants I’ve been too and my god the food... everything was so perfectly made and thoughtfully presented. Don’t miss the steak tartar and the dough filled with fish - just out of this world.
Also, leave room for their stellar wine selections and the dessert — the hazelnut cream pastry was a true highlight

Also, chef Dominique Crenn was so approachable and made sure throughout
The evening we’re enjoying ourselves and even shared some personal stories

Truly an experience to remember - can’t wait to go back!<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUTGjs-FxhUxPOmf5_Ov0jFMVHeeqYT2EtbXny=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-Vw_wCmDtu5JJBw1jFe8xuDTfMIt4wAuc1z2k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Bar Crenn is a gem tucked away in an otherwise plain-looking building. I went in a group of 5 and we were seated at comfortable little nook at the back with a plush sofa and armchairs. First off: shoutout to the staff. Our server was such a dear and the manager Arrika was the best: she helped accommodate an extra guest and pregnancy food restrictions. We ordered a couple of every plate and they were delightful—inventive, tasty, and great accompaniments to our drinks. Even though it’s more a bar with small bites than a restaurant, I wasn’t feeling like having alcohol and the staff accommodated me with a wonderful non-alcoholic ginger cherry drink that still made me feel like I got to enjoy the experience. Overall an excellent time—hopefully I can get a reservation at Atelier Crenn next time I’m in town to try that next!<//text>< Pics>

<Text>Behind the dark unassuming entrance at 3131 Fillmore is the jewel box Bar Crenn…a glimmering, plush, scrumptious little spot where you’ll spend the evening feeling lucky to be there. From the above and beyond service to the delicate cuisine that has redefined our expectations of champagne, caviar, oysters and duck, we're forever ruined…in a good way. Prepare to be transported. Bon appétit.< /Text>< response>

<Date>1533949191938< /Date><Review>Great restaurant/bar combination serving special cocktails, fine wines, and small plates. We had a few plates to share and each of us had our own small main course. Dominique has fielded another amazing restaurant/bar with this concept. adjacent to Atelier Crenn, this location is much more homey and relaxed than the formalized Atelier Crenn meal. I love both locations and will be back to both.<//Review>< rating>

Ordered oysters, brioche, bone marrow, flat bread pizza, and seafood pot pie type dish. I think I would've been full without the bone marrow, but that was one of my favorites of the night.< /Review>< pictures>

Blow your mind amazing. Must order brioche bread with your meal. Unique experience with special details, everything from ornate dishware to small delicate boxes of chocolate, this is a San Francisco must. Spend time at this spot, and order loads of bubbles, bread and chocolate.<//Text>

<Text>Expect a well-curated wine list and delicious food. Most menu items are good for sharing. The wine list is very heavy on French and European wine. Oh, and this place isn't cheap. Many glasses are north of $20.<//Text><time>1533480857581< /time>< Gmap_id>

I would like to start by saying the service was phenomenal and this rating does not reflect the hard work of those that serve here.

This rating is for the overhyped, over priced meal. The food was subpar and the portion sizes were a joke. The only items that were worth eating were the Brioche and the Tomato Tarte everything else fell short of “fine dining” by a long shot. I have dined at many of the Bay Area’s Michelin Star restaurants and Ben Crenn by far was the worst one yet. Quince and many other places may be more expensive but much more worth it.

The mushroom carpaccio was made up of one finely sliced flavorless mushrooms. At first we thought it was shaved Parmesan cheese for our child sized Mushroom Raviolis (we ordered THREE servings). We also paid $36 for a 2oz serving of Halibut. IT LITTERALLY LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE TRYING TO MAKE MINIATURE MEALS.

For $500 I would expect way more from a restaurant. It make me question why they add a mandatory 20% gratuity to all bills, my assumption is that no one wanted to tip due to the sham of a dining experience Bar Crenn exhibits.

After paying a ridiculous amount of money for this unsatisfactory food($350) and over priced bottle of Cabernet($150 that normally costs $35) we went next door to Tacko to enjoy a true San Fran dining experience. Save your money, save your time and skip this place at all cost. I really don’t see how anyone could rate this place 5 stars. We had a good laugh about the experience on the ride home so the humor of the situation earned this place 2 stars.<//Text>

The food was excellent - everything we had was creative, perfectly prepared, and absolutely delicious. The service was also perfect. We really liked their wine list, with great selections from France in particular as you might expect. The highlights were the Siberian Ossetra caviar (served with bone marrow custard and smoked creme fraiche), the beef tartare, and the apple tart. This is pricey but worth the splurge. Now I really want to go to Atelier Crenn!</text>

As soon as we stepped foot into the tiny path that felt like a hidden alley, the door began to open. "Welcome" said the Maître d', and soon we were whisked away to the far corner of the restaurant.

Upon entering it felt like a secret Parisienne hideaway that only exists for locals, but after settling down I felt much more at home. Books lined the shelves against the wall, with familiar art hung subtly in leftover nooks. The bar light shimmers from exquisite crystal chandeliers and seated patrons fill the marble counter at capacity. The soft sounds of chatter from people on dates, others catching up and discussing recent travels, and some just taking in the scene.

The staff couldn't have been more friendly and welcoming as if we were guests or friends. What made it even more special was to have Dominque herself join our dining section while her lovely wife and friend were seated next to us engaging in pleasant conversation. I'm sure we scared her away with all of our praises, but they were well deserved.

The food was incredible (as expected). The caviar in egg starter is always a favorite and should be enjoyed with a glass of divinely-paired wine. The avocado "ravioli" was out of this world, with fresh and delicate flavors that packed a meaningful punch. I could've enjoyed that dish again and again. Salmon and dessert followed next but my personal bread and butter has to be her own Brioche and whipped beef fat spread. Simply heaven.

Thank you again to the entire Crenn family. This won't be our last meal with you.< /text>

Beautiful space but overly pretentious and wildly priced. Not at all like a French wine bar.walked in to put our name on the list and was forgotten. Came back 30 mins later to a 1/2 empty space. Very apologetic yet fell short of expectations.</Text>

Yogurtland is good. I am not always a fan of the limited selection of froyo. However, I can usually find something I like. This location is pretty good. The way they are handling the pandemic I think could be done way differently. Just pass out disposable gloves and put the dots on the floor. Or only allow one family or one person up at a time to get their own yogurt. Just have the employees put on the toppings. It would allow people to vet in and get out much faster.<//Text>

Its a good place to go. We usually go when its not too busy around 6-7:30pm. I'm giving it 4 stars because we can't make our own fro-yo but the service is still great.</review>

This was a frustrating process. You have to scream at them what flavors. She asked full or half full I stated half full watched her fill it to the top anyway. Then had to scream the toppings while the next person was screaming there and I kept getting what what what did you say. Then it was 20 bucks for two cups. Just a super frustrating experience< /Review>

<Review>Normally i like this place but this last time i went to go pick up an online order. The transaction was accepted online and said they were preparing it and everything, but when i got there and asked for it they said they never accepted the order because they were getting ready to close. So obviously there are some things they need to work out as far as communication between store and orders from the internet.< /Review>< pics>

<text>This is my favorite Yogurtland. Location is convenient. I must say I'm always greeted with a smile &  friendly professionalism by Shift Lead Joy. She's helpful always going above beyond attending to the customers.  Joy keeps the dining area so clean well maintained. Always a pleasant clean atmosphere great experience. Yogurtland Corp. is represented in a positive light with Shift Lead Joy. She's a great asset & should be recognized & commended by her Superiors & HHR.
Thank you Joy for always making my visit to Yogurtland  pleasant one.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< Review>
I went at night around 8:30 and I was looking at the door to see when they closed and it said 9. I wasn’t paying complete attention to my hand actions and I accidentally touched the window trying to open the door . The second I walked in I doubled checked and I asked the lady if they were open and she had a attitude with me . She rudely said “yes.... but you just put your hand on my window and I just cleaned it” and I was like “oh my bad I’m sorry It was a accident” and she just stared at me with the dirtiest look for a while it was so awkward and uncomfortable. She looked at me like I broke the window and then she finally spoke and said “uhh okay yea what do you want” and the entire time I was very nice and polite and she had a attitude with me the entire time. She was a African American women who was no offense a little on the heavy side.< /Review>

<text>We were visiting Lancaster and needed a light lunch. We love fro-yo so found this store. This girl working there wasn't very welcoming. They didn't have sample cups out. We had to ask and she only gave us one each. The yogurt selection was small. It was soon after the opened and the yogurt wasn't quite to the frozen state yet. It was kinda sloppy. Melted quickly. The place was clean. Took credit cards. Easy to find with our GPS. In a small strip mall. Free parking in front of store. WC accessible. Credit cards accepted.<//text><Rate>3<//Rate>< userid>

<Text>First time here. Excellent and friendly service. Very clean and the attention to keeping it clean was to be saluted. Ive never gone out of my way to try one of these places before. That changes tonight. I will be returning to try the many variations available.<//Text>< name>

<Review>Aside from September not providing us with equal treatment as she did with the customers in line before us, she assisted them with their lids and reward program. Whereas, with us she directed us to get our own lids and was not patient with us as we pulled out our reward card and told us to just go to the website. Yet, did not inform why we needed to go the website. So we walked out in confusion and laughter at the lack of customer service to everyone. Other than that, tge yougurt was great!<//Review><Rating>2<//Rating>< UserId.>

It's tiny and often crowded on warm days. Skip any toppers that can go stale in open air because it's guaranteed that those in the topper bar are indeed already stale. Top notch flavors.</Review>

<text>I received some coupons in the mail so I decided to take my babies. Let me just say I will absolutely be coming back. I never write reviews but I just had to for this store. The girl that helped us provided us with the best customer service possible (she even took time to give us a tour of how everything works), invited us to join their point thingy, and invited us to come back to some event this Saturday where they only charge $5 to fill up your cups. Man this store has AMAZING deals! I sure will be back Saturday. Also, morning time might be the best time because there isn’t too many people.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Polite staff, clean tables, delicious yogurt in a wide variety of flavours, tons of toppings to choose from.

It's pricey, but that's probably just because I load my cup up to the brim and put a buttload of toppings on it before I throw it all down my throat in one like a greedy pelican.< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp><time>1541650486948<//time><pictures>None< /pictures><Name>Name Not Important<//Name></record>

I just wanted to say that yogurtland is the shiznit! And I wanted to give it up to the worker today, Joy! She was great and i said a comment that was rude to my mom, and it came out wrong and I just want Joy to know that it wasn't directed to her in any way!!!</review>

I like the flavors of yogurt but I wish the yogurt didn't melt so fast. If you get it to go, it is soupy by the time you get home. The prices have been raised so many times that they are RIDICULOUSLY high now.</review>

I love it here. Being from S.F. It's been a place I've wanted to visit. It's beautiful unique, special place. The people are warm, and friendly. Everyday I go to the beach. I see something different every day.< /Text>

<Review>The Atrium Garden Inn is a wonderful place to stay. My husband and I stayed three nights to celebrate our anniversary, and although we first came as guests at the inn, we left feeling like family. There are so many intricate details in the way the inn has been remodeled and decorated that it feels like a home away from home. The owner Beth puts her heart into all that she does at the inn, which definitely includes the breakfast! She arrives at 4:30am every day to ensure that a warm and delicious homemade meal is made with the freshest ingredients and is available for guests by 7:30am. My husband and I chose to sit at the table closest to the kitchen, and as a result were able to enjoy many intellectual conversations with Beth as we ate our breakfast. Beth wants every person to feel comfortable at the inn, so if guests need anything they are welcome to ask for it. The innkeeper Michael was very helpful and thoroughly explained self check-in procedures when I called to let him know we would be running late and arrive after 8:00pm. In person he is kind and always smiling and has many stories to tell. When we forgot one of our travel pillows in the room after leaving, Helena promptly messaged us and asked us what we would like them to do with it. The inn even has a very sweet cat called Ru that greeted us when we arrived and Beth brings her dog Choco, making the place very pet friendly. Overall the experience was magnificent and we look forward to returning soon!<//Review>< Name>

It would have been better if the Staff could have returned repeated calls regarding a lost item. That was the worst bit about my trip.< /text>

The breakfast was amazing. Eggs, bacon, sausages and home fries. Delicious spinach and feta quiche,  homemade muffins and apple dumplings to die for! Plus friut, yogurt, juices and toast and jams.  Great ambience and price. Would definitely recommend.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

The room was spacious enough for my boyfriend and I, the bathroom was very clean and the check in and out process were quick and easy. Breakfast that came with the room was incredible, everything we could have wanted from fresh bread, bacon, eggs, sausage, quiche, muffins and pastries....this is definitely where I will stay when I’m up here from now on. Great job to the new management.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80803537bce0ca81:0xca5f27291620433d</gmap_id></record>

<Text>I showed up at the tail end of a destructive winter storm that had downed trees and broken doors.  Despite the chaos, Beth and Helena went well out of their way to ensure my family's comfort.  Breakfast was above and beyond, their guidance was on point, and they were even hospitable to my dogs.  Wouldn't stay anywhere else!<//Text>< Pics>

It's an Airbnb now. It was a place to sleep and shower and I was able to bring my dog. Other than that, wouldn't recommend. One "worker" told me the lease was up and I was the last person to stay which is probably for the best.< /Text>

<Text>My husband and I stayed at the Atrium for two days and loved every minute of it. The two ladies that run the place are very kind and patient, and they had great recommendations for things to do in town. The room we wrre in was called the quilt room and was very clean and cozy. The breakfast was delicious! Fresh fruit, great coffee, and good home style cooking. The atrium is in a great location and withing walking distance of whatever you may be interested in. Overall, it felt like staying with family you haven't seen in a while. We will definitely be back.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<user>103068102702700271098</user><Rate>4</Rate><text>Nice large room, great bed. Walls paper thin, so slept very little. Ultimately depends on who is staying there, so bit of a gamble. No one in office, so you just pick up key from lockbox. No breakfast, so technically not a B&B. Nice location, close to beach, and plenty of parking in back. Nice sitting area outside, but may want to bring something to block sunlight out from windows that have only see through blinds. Liked the place overall, just not great if you want to sleep.</text><response>None</response>< pics>

Do not come here if you're unable to navigate narrow and high staircases. The space itself varies based on what room you request to be in, some being WAY nicer than others, so expect the unexpected. We sure were surprised.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

The staff was really nice, and the hotel is located in a good spot, lots of places to eat around.  The brewery nearby is a great place to have dinner in the weekend, they have live jazz.  There is also a nearby ice cream place that serves really yummy home made ice cream.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>We visited for a quick weekend getaway and could not imagine staying in a better location! We were walking distance to trails, restaurants, shops, etc., which was extremely convenient. The room itself was very cozy, the bed was comfortable, and the hosts were extremely gracious when it came to reccommendations. The only shortcoming was the lack of access to a refrigerator. Being from out of town, we were able to enjoy the amazing restaurants but our leftovers had to be left behind. We enjoyed our stay and wish to visit again in the future!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80803537bce0ca81:0xca5f27291620433d<//gmapID></record>

<Text>Clean, comfortable room. Friendly staff. Warm breakfast (frittata, sausage, granola and yogurt) was nice in the morning. In the afternoon, they also served us tea and brownies. Walking distance to a few restaurants and the North Coast Brewery. It's a good bed and breakfast. We'd go back again.< /Text>< pictures>

Really not worth the money. The location doesn't even serve breakfast any more. (We weren't told this until we arrived after booking.) Not to mention we were told breakfast across the street (Cafe 1, great place by the way.) was comped up to $30. They did not honor that statement. The room was tiny, the traffic on the street was annoying and loud. It's next to a run down auto body shop, and the shared bathroom had only two towels. If you're coming to explore Fort Bragg do NOT stay at the Atrium. If this place was $75/night I'd consider it. But not for the prices they charge.<//review>

<rating>3</rating><Text>This is not a Bed & Breakfast. Their new stationery identifies the property as a Bed and Bike (a B&B, just not the kind you might think). I booked a preferred room ("Lodge") over the phone with the owner, but upon arrival 4 months later found that the property had changed hands, breakfast was no longer served, and the new management  claimed ignorance of my very traditional booking arrangement. The preferred room that I arranged had been given to another party. Complaining that I was "out two breakfasts" promised to me by the previous owner  the manager arranged to have two continental breakfasts (muffin and berries) left at our door both days. This WAS done. Also in apology for losing our reservation the owner had management deliver a nice bottle of cabernet to us. So there's that. I regard what happened to us as an unique deal and would not be repeated. Nevertheless, the accomodations are comfortable and each room is unique. Also if you can wangle a reservation in the room named "Lodge" you should probably stay there.</Text>< Pictures>

If you just want a bed with few amenities close to town, this is the place. The room is nice but there was a major miscommunication with the owners and we were put in the wrong room. There are no coffee makers in the rooms, just pour overs, and a tiny refrigerator. The WiFi is not strong and has issues if more than one person is using it.< /text>

We had a great stay in Fort Bragg at the Atrium. We came here to go to the sea glass beach which was totally worth the 4 hour drive from Palo Alto, Ca. We chose the Atrium because it looked nice on the pictures, was close to the glass beach and they allow dogs. We didn't wanna stay at a motel 6 or something. We paid $305 for 2 nights for 2 people plus dog incl. breakfast and tax. It was totally reasonable. The room was clean, the bed was very comfy! The bathroom was on the floor but 2 steps from our room. The service was very nice. Great breakfast with egg soufles, toast, bagels, fresh fruit, coffee, oj, tea.... it was yummy and they have a very pretty relaxing backyard/garden area! We had a great stay and would come back.<//review>

Owner is super helpful and knows her products.  This store is much larger and in a new location then on my last visit  to this area several years ago.  I  love the leather paints and the fabric dyes carried here. Easy to park here as well.< /Text>

I work here, so feel free to ask questions 😊
We try to carry a bit of everything, and with over 7,000 sq ft I think we've succeeded! However, if we don't have it we can order it for you.
We do custom framing, mat cutting, dry mounting, etc., and Brian always does beautiful work. We can stretch and frame pre-painted canvas as well. If you've got a painting that's been hiding in a tube in the back of a closet bring it in and we'll get it ready to hang proudly on your wall!
Classroom space now available! Check our website for the current schedule or to inquire about rental rates.
Let's make some art today!!< /text>

Terrific art supply store with a huge selection of frames, paints and supplies. I've had framing done here in the past and love the work they do.  Won't go anyplace else. Plus the new store has plenty of parking.< /Review>

<Text>Supporting local businesses is really important and this art store makes it easy. I know purchasing certain things may be easier or cheaper from larger chains like Michael's or Amazon but Art and Soul provides great service and an impressive array of art supplies. I was shocked when I saw how much they had in stock! Whatever art phase you're in, watercolor art brushes, watercolor ink, fancy brushes or anything else, this shop has it for you!< /Text><Resp>None<//Resp><user_name>Lorraine S< /user_name></record>

They're also willing to special order. I bought what I thought was a defunct pencil sharpener and the staff messed around with it and made it work. Lovely folks. Surprisingly broad selection for our little town.< /Review><response>None<//response><userid>107134056374253796962</userid></record>

They went back on an agreement for a cash refund for some supplies I bought for some aid work I did back during the fires, would only give me store credit.

<text>The lady who worked here, (I'm assuming she was the owner) was extremely rude. So much so that I left and took my business elsewhere in spite of the fact that because I believe in supporting local businesses and I drove 15 miles on a trip that's purpose was specifically to go to this store< /text><name>Gregory K< /name>< date>

Beautiful place with beautiful people. All different races and cultures coming together together to pray for peace on earth for everyone. But they need to be more clear on their web site. I see that 10 an English mass ok perfect for me. But now how do I get to go to mass do I have to register. It says limited capacity so is it first come first serve what time do I need to get there to be a part of that capacity? Questions that most people will ask but I can’t find the answers on the web site. And I don’t like searching sites to get basic answers.<//Text>

<review>Beautiful church, the organ and acoustics are phenomenal. The social distancing was handled well. I'm sorry I missed the choir. Only issue was that I left the service early and the only exit was locked up tight. I wandered around for 20 minutes till a guard happened to come by as he was throwing a parishioner out.  Seriously. I think he was the guy ruining the service by loudly repeating everything the priest (was he a priest?) said. Isn't it a hazard to have all the exits locked?</review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c2c651d95548c9:0x65e0ac4b47f3f069< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is a wonderful place to visit.  Beautiful Architecture and a nice place to attend mass.  I’ve enjoyed every visit here and am waiting for the chance to join a guided tour.  This is another Blessing we have as Southern Californians.  God Bless Us All.< /Text>

It's not enough to just have believe and have faith, one must trust God. With free will we are given the ability to choose our path, the easy way or the hard way, the long path or the short path. Regardless of the choice, God loves us the same. He loves us in spite of us.

With free will comes responsibility. As long as we are free to make choices and decisions, we can't blame God for when things don't go our way.

Live in gratitude for the blessings of God and you will be blessed with reasons to be grateful.  Blessings.<//Text>

Visited for a Sunday morning Mass in ordinary time. The cathedral has some nice exhibits on the sides and a mausoleum underneath. The interior of the church sanctuary is very bland. The Tabernacle is off in a side chapel. Very plain inside with weird architecture. Great focus on being friendly, which was nice, but we were hoping for a stronger emphasis on the sacred as well. Very casual atmosphere. Choir sounded lovely. Parking garage was convenient.< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>An incredible cathedral that captures the Gothic effect of the tremendous and fascinating mystery of God while also appropriating beautiful, delicate touches to draw one to the sacred. The use of light, construction media, and line in the space leave one feeling both focused, while also comforted and warmed by the tapestries and sacred art. Would delight to experience elaborate liturgy here. Stunningly beautiful and holy!< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMteniwi2j7qZWQQJLOb9caYnFMX18IA8i2pATB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoOb2SoxThmu4gpSc7sd1Hh05Zg6tuAjqrxtSZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaHBtliBxHo8_08qlu-6znpLhR_EnvMkKr_HgZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUQoAGxH51ggbOjf6KoeB5GomTY-W-U7CutUf_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZ3PdKeg0EnCbptsgWd0RAOgMmg63b5xsUhB6_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c2c651d95548c9:0x65e0ac4b47f3f069< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great modern cathedral. Very spacious. With a crypt and St Vibiana's tomb. Service is excellent. A lot of volunteers. Choir, organist, and flutist are excellent. Well maintained and very clean.<//review>

A beautiful physical structure...a huge tribute to our Heavenly Father...and all He stands for! They share their parking lot for Superior Court...(it's close)!
Tours are available and the art-work inside is worth the time...it's a "City Treaasure."
Good weekend trip for kids! Something free to do...that will keep their interest!
Great place to find yourself on a Sunday morning for a full service.<//Review>

Stunning place. Check for the schedule of organ recitals. On a free afternoon of a business trip I randomly wandered past this amazing complex and was very fortunate to walk in during an organ recital and there was maybe two dozen people there. A shame. It was amazing<//text>

The architecture of the church is very nice but plain. I went on a weekday when there were no mass services so it was pretty empty. You are able to walk almost anywhere in the church, including the lower level moslem. The inside is huge and gives you this feeling of being to small. Does not have the feeling of community that I prefer but it does have seating for everyone.
parking in the structure is $24! A outdoor prayer candle is $10!<//Review>

As usual, it only happened once a year around this time on November. The Vietnamese of communities from Los Angeles areas gathered at this Magnificent Cathedral our Lady of Angels in LA to celebrate The feast of Vietnamese Martyrs. Most of the Vietnamese from Los Angeles all came to celebrate this big event. The Choirs were from 13 different Vietnamese churches in LA Diocese . The music were beautiful with close to 200 members. You could see the Vietnamese Traditions on display from clothes to the music. This church was so big you could see it from the 101 freeway and it’s located at the corner of Broadway and Temple . This church was built with the great designs , and it took years to complete. There was a plenty of parkings inside the structure. You could walk around the church to see its beauty. From the front of the church you also could enter from the front on the left side or the right. You could also go down to under the church to see the tombs of people whom were buried there.  And there were small Chapels that you could do a prayer. On the side of this church, you could see the 101 freeway from below and hollywood or china town areas. There are so much things you can do from this Cathedral such as Little Tokyo , LA Music Center and Downtown LA just few blocks away. It is a beautiful place to visit or go to mass at this church whenever you either come to visit or come for prayers you must stop by.<//text>

<Review>Of course it’s a must-see place to visit in Los Angeles, California.
This modern architecture you won’t see anywhere else.
This Catedral is unique.
You should see it, regardless you are religious or not.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMutT07hBIl_03g6iPk0P8wE6XsLSMlYSI2Aqdn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnEjZb_Eith9ytED8RBp11LUfCb2Ti0DU9qcHx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNW26G8ZVvQWT7HchhGjm6WPT9eu3ZxzZSUZD89=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOI0yIDDwxGGoUpTJQ6ky50VcX_WQRNNICmDvfJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUOvE_iv_nfYlCfIpA2FPK8-s9jyX4lyOz-tgH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqk0cAGbizCp5-zSOSkxt1ccKdihBrx3Aq3I81=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7kF8DO8qTpxxQDmAxcd6yq4oG-vk90hyz4Q4O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1kgsrnTDI6voLJBnyGL89GYCzVBB6JS0vZRbC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcfUNoTCV7-GIz-_FZVxv8ocokNciedPT_EK4F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0fR6PBytF7B-ZW_JiRAjB5mKBQfcuvlSj9dqD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6RJ9qJhWPgAj7La367LmLZvso-M7Q_tnQK0bS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMt8b7vi0rXZPUu4m4o5iLGxT26V6ynaTYB6nfT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2c651d95548c9:0x65e0ac4b47f3f069</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>If there is one thing in the world that I like it is a modern cathedral and Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles definitely fits the bill. Worth the peaceful wander around including the crypt next time you are in LA.<//Review><username>Craig Smith</username>< userid>

Beautifully done, I finally had a chance to come by and visit. I love the tapestries on the walk very well executed.

The music sounded amazing and I really enjoyed the experience.<//review>

I saw pictures of this cathedral and it didn’t not seem impressive or visually appealing but visiting in person changed my perspective. This cathedral is absolutely massive. The layout is very untraditional with very modern lines and almost and industrial feeling yet very peaceful. The little chapels contain a variety of treasures and artwork. I think my favorite aspect of this cathedral are the murals lining he nave with the plethora of saints facing the alter. This is a place you definitely want to experience for yourself.<//text>

<review>I always try to visit cathedrals when I travel, and this one was no exception. I have to be honest and admit I was very disappointed. A modern architecture church just does not feel like a church. This concrete abomination has no warmth or character.  Take down the religious imagery and statues and a modern church such as this could be a lunch room, museum or Sam's club. I hate to be a downer, but the archdiocese deserves something more classic and timeless than this. I've never negatively reviewed a church before this, but there's a first time for everything.< /review>< pictures>

Actually from the first view i didn't believe that it is a church.
The infrastructure didn't meat with the idea of what I seen in every place. the modern idea of this like church must be come in every where.</text>

<Text>I was actually disappointed at the poor quality of this banquet hall and not to mention the smell ( they definitely need to clean the carpet or something). I attended a graduation here and although the ceremony was at night it awfully hot and stuffy. Also $22 dollars for parking!!! I think it’s pretty ridiculous 🤷‍♀️</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6VObX2nxNfahZMAz_bWz6XfuSyXCEfRUYN9Am=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbyLk7y_r_KS0ebryrqWQiv94vY8khdq6vt9Jm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdhFG83chxGXmxwenAo75Utddrb7AvuEac5XhL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
The Cathedral of Our Lady of Angels is so beautiful and peaceful. This is a place where you could sit, pray, meditate and talk to the Lord.They have a lovely gift shop.  Remember, that wherever you are God is!

When the enemy comes to attack you, you must stand strong through prayer and supplication. Trusting and believing in Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour. He has the final say! Turn to  God for His help.  He will hear you and answer  you. His Love, Mercy and Grace will protect you.

Jesus Christ is our refuge in times of trouble. Pray, my Christian brothers and sisters, do not lose hope, no matter what you're going through.. Pray!!! God is there  for you. Blessings to you all.< /Review>

Welcoming community at Mass.  It’s great that they have Masses daily.  Would be nice if there was a self guided tour to follow.  Very modern architecture.  Gift shop is nice with some beautiful items, but a little pricey.  If you sign up for their mailing list, they will email you a discount for your birthday month.  But, they won’t give you the discount if you are buying something, it is your birthday month, and you are just signing up.  This happened to me on Tuesday.</text>

I'm sure I'm not going to be in the majority here but I have visited places of worship all over the world and this one feels very cold. I did not feel the warmth of a community inside of these walls. I'm sad to say that but but felt Stark cold and to be honest someone run down. The windows, although slanted, are covered in dust and make the place look shabby. The grounds are beautiful and Serene but one cannot mistake the sound of the freeway roaring by.<//text>

A modern church in the heart of Downtown LA, big church and spacious. It took us quite a walk to find the entrance, it would be good if there is more signage on the direction. There's daily mass service around noon, you can see people are rushing to join the mass. When you get inside, you will immediately humble by the big beautiful paintings and the peaceful serene atmosphere. It would be good if there is guided tour for the visitors, so that we can learn more about the place.</Text>

Until you go in, you won't believe something so big can be so beautiful!

The building with the parking is literally one block long.  One side is the train station, Music Center and the other side is the freeway.  Then you go in and see more beautiful interior.  It's breathtaking!<//Text>

I continuously have a joy-filled experience there, whether at mass, on a tour, or when seeing music events there. The homilies are always relevant and well thought out. The priests and/or archbishop greet the congregation after mass every week as if it was a small parish. I find that refreshing.<//review>

One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church!  A priest saw my son and offered a blessing which we welcomed.  We didnt even ask and we were extremely grateful.  My son has been sleeping during the day and awake at night.  After the father's blessing he stopped!<//Text>

Iconic! Everything about being here is pleasant. They have a very big courtyard...events and gatherings. This sacred place feels like a museum and not the Holy Place it really is. Beautiful layout...aesthetic...and architectural draw. Parking available...they have location that provides some type kitchen food options. Great Must See Location if your in Los Angeles.</Review>

<text>What a huge place. I love that it has parking and it seems it fits so many cars. I went there for the venue and I loved that it's located on the 2nd floor which makes it even more private. Plus I really liked the fact that it has a foyer and it doesn't get over crowded if you have a lot of guest (over 300 people). Great for large events, plus it's so close to Grand Park.</text>< pictures>

The cathedral is magnificent and underneath is just as wonderful. Marble crypts, stained glass arts, and chapels. All these is worth a visit.

Attending a mass is an added benefit. A good way to see Catholic traditions and feel the welcome of a community. On Sundays, there are only two morning English masses and a Spanish noon mass. If you're an early riser, stop for a mass after touring the facility.</Text>

What an amazing place to be! Went to a mass in the beautiful building. The layout and the structure of the cathedral is what will catch your eye. Went to mass during the afternoon and it was a fulfilling experience. Stop by if you're in the downtown L.A.<//Review>

That's a very sad temple. It's much more similar to an events place than a Catholic Cathedral. Modernism doesn't fit to spiritual places.<//text>

Beautiful cathedral. Everything about it is absolutely right and an architectural masterpiece. Having the cathedral in downtown Los Angeles is fitting, especially when you can get away for an hour or so and be at peace, in mass, in meditation or in prayer.< /text>

It is a Holy Catholic Church. It had.... intersting music. The people there nice. The most important person in the Universe, God, pushed off to the side ina different room. Why? I don't know. It is weridly shaped, but it still has The Holy Eucharist.< /Review>

This cathedral is a work of art, from the outside design, to the vastness of the inside. The intricate work on the inside, from the tapestries on the walls, the stained glass pictures, the woodwork, and even the burial plots for those who wish to be buried within the church walls, it is just amazing.< /Text>

Was not prepared for how awesome this place is! Went there out of love for architecture and art and was blown away. Really cool and worth seeing if you’re in the neighborhood for the Broad, MOCA and Grand Park.</review>

A peaceful place, open for all to pray, relax and give the stressed mind a free time. I got to see the popular Organ. Forward description of Organ is copied from Wikipedia: The organ is opus 75 of Dobson Pipe Organ Builders of Lake City, Iowa and is a 105 rank/ 4 manual instrument that incorporates pipes from the 1929 Wangerin organ of St. Vibiana's Cathedral. Dobson's Opus 75 has a total of 6,019 pipes. It is the 89th largest pipe organ in North America and the 143rd largest in the world.<//text>

<text>Architecturally stunning and spiritually refreshing! This is a great place to escape the worries of the world and engage in quiet reflection. Parking in the church structure can be pricey ($20) so plan your trip accordingly or search for nearby lots.

It's a beautiful modern catholic church. Finding parking in the building is very hard, especially between two masses as there seems to be only one entry and one exit.</Review>

<text>If you're truly Catholic and you truly have faith this is the church I truly would suggest you to go to if you love God and love the Catholicism there's many things around nothing if you're not like a True Believer or do you have any other Faith but I suggest any faith of any other religion of anybody to go to this church at Cathedral of Our Lady of Angels cuz it's the Los Angeles Church that anyone should go to if they want to go and pray the rosary or go to a mass cuz it's a really unified Church to go to and it's been very pleasant to visit that church and thank you for the experiences that have been put through God there just to be at that location<//text>< Pics>

It is always a spiritual experience, the parking attended lady was very kind and considerate. She show me a space that was close to the ticket booth as well as the street, which I was going to the County of Los Angeles Hall of Administration of the Board of Supervisors meeting.</Text>

I cried looking at the cross. This was the most beautiful cross I have ever seen. I'm a non practicing Catholic but was born and raised in the church with all sacraments outside of death at this point. I wish I could have stayed longer than the few minutes I had because the feeling I got here was incredible. Outside of the rude people acting as if it was a restaurant and they could talk as if they were at a party? Please observe the signs that say BE QUIET! This is a holy space for everyone to feel peace in. And it's amazing.<//review>

The masses are chill. I grew up in an uptight Irish conservative god fearing catholic family and this definitely nothing like that at all. - And there are shorter masses with less music EVERYDAY of the week at noon. Perfect for your lunch hour if you work close and need some time for God. - It's also Breathtakingly gorgeous. So theres that.< /review>

A beautiful & respectful piece of public archetecture for the Los Angeles community.  I wasn't there for a service, but just wanted to see some of the components of this religious heritage art work piece that has been built for tge people of our community.
I will enjoy returning again to better experience some of what I missed on this, my first-ever visit.</text>

<text>Awe inspiring structure. Great place to worship. You have to be open to a modern and authentic type of Cathedral to really appreciate the beauty inside and out. Only downside was not having a visible Tabernacle or if it was it was hard to find.  Have for parking on site. There is a place to eat and a gift shop. Do go and check it out.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Very pretty and such an amazing Cathedral!! We sadly ordered a tour guide but she didn't end up showing up so that was a bummer... but we walked around on our own and the beauty of this place amazed me 😍 There are  restrooms and a cafe located in a building on the right side of the entrance so that was a major convenience :)))</Review>< pics>

<Text>I don't usually appreciate modern style churches but this one is an exception. I love that they did not overdo the contemporary designs and make it look weird or too artistic. Also, a perfect place to pray and reflect. I just wish that they also improve the altar of the image of Our Lady of the Angels as compared to the altar of the Our Lady of Guadalupe.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Cathedral has become my home church after moving to LA. I've been a regular Sunday mass attendee including the recent midnight Easter mass, which was just magical. I do Xmas Mass with my mom at my home home church, but I'm sure it was just as memorable. Never have I attended mass in quite a spectacular looking church as this, besides St. Peters in NYC.

There is still the familiar cross-shaped architecture as with other Catholic churches. This one has a slight stadium seating elevation that others have negatively interpreted as looking down at the altar. First hand though it's not really bad, so go see it for yourself.

The most appealing aspect of Cathedral is the wide open, huge courtyard at the entryway. I've never seen a church that paid as much attention or dedicated square footage for this. This is also in the heart of Downtown LA so that's double impressive. I cannot speak for the parking since I walk here from home. I can imagine that it's impacted and costly though in the underground lot.</Review><Response>None< /Response><name>JR C</name><Rate>5< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

The reason of Why I went to the church service today is because Jose Jordan lost his partner Russell Knight back on Sunday, November 27, 2016, there was a Special Service that was Reserved for Russell Knight, however, during the service they did Not Mention His Name, but the service was absolutely and totally Reserved In His Name for the Remembrance Of His Death.

They even had his name written in their Notebook as well with Jose Jordan's name mentioned too since he is the only close survivor known to Rusty Knight.

Furthermore, I was the only one who showed up for this Very Special Service today at 12:10 p.m. back on Monday, November 27, 2017.

I just want to personally Thank Father David Gallardo for providing a wonderful service today in memory of Russell Knight.

Sincerely yours,

Howard Paul Shore

A stunning new vision for the Catholic faithful. Not only is it an incredibly accessable cathedral for all of Los Angeles, but it is a jewel of architecture, design, and reverence for everyone to enjoy.  Tours are available, but the Cathedral is open every day for Mass.<//review>

I am not a big fan of "contemporary" church architecture but I have to say that when I visited the Cathedral today it was much more beautiful in person. You can clearly see the complex from the highway and makes you feel that the Church is alive and well in LA. The exterior was a little too protestant for me and I was disappointed to not see any crucifix out in either the garden or right in front of the church itself. The water features are very nice and I like that the grounds are walled off, it is not only safer but makes you feel that you are not in downtown. There is a lady at the information desk who was very helpful and sweet. I thought the garden in front (mainly olives) was nice but was wondering why there were no religious statues, only secular ones (from what I could see)....

The Cathedral itself is massive and very open, which is nice. The mineral stained glass is beautiful and I love the pipe organ. The alter is quite lovely too, although again everything is contemporary, but for some odd reason there were no stations of the cross anywhere. The tapestries adorning the walls where the faithful sit was very nice. My major issue with the design of this Cathedral is that the Blessed Sacrament is hidden in a small room (with NO crucifix present), which boggles me since there (as far as I could tell) was no chapel were Mass could be said, so WHY is it not in a more prominent place? And second, many, but not all, of the alcoves had what looked to me as contemporary secular artwork (which was bizarre and actually quite unappealing). At times I felt that I was walking through a modern art gallery, not a church dedicated to the glory of our Lord. Aside from that, I enjoyed the beautiful sacred space and spending time with our Lord.

P.S. I would have to agree with a previous reviewer that the Cathedral was fairly sterile looking but I feel that in this case the idea of simplicity may be appropriate. Furthermore, I agree that the "stadium" style seats do at first make you cringe since the alter is at a lower level than some of the pews, however, the alter is still elevated from the base floor. I think the idea is to allow everyone to be able to clearly see the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. Although I would not care to see this architectural style to ever be the norm, in general it was nice and went well with the rest of the church.

Besides the Blessed Sacrament not being in an appropriate and conspicuous place ( I had to ask the Janitor and he smirked as if he gets asked all the time) the only "sin" is the parking..... $8 for 25 minutes, that is ridiculous...</Review>

I wrote to the church asking for their guidance about some work and interest that I have in the community and received no response I think this is unacceptable it's been several months and I painstakingly drafted a letter to the head of this place and emailed it to him and his receptionist and his secretary who is directing me to do this and I receive no response it's ridiculous. I was inquiring about a project to help collaborate with police to educate them about non-lethal weapons.</Text>

<text>To me this Cathedral was really a surprise. I'm use to visit cathedrals all around Europe and this one is completely different. The building is quite new. The bells are in the enclosure door, the have a parking and a gift shop as well as a nice garden with animal figures. Funny place. As I said, I've never seen a cathedral like this one.<//text>< name>

< review>
One of the most beautiful places to go when you visit the City of Los Angeles Ca. Each time that I been there is solemn and respectful, is a place to learn while you visit, I have noticed that they have different exhibits quite often, and each one has been magnificent , the Christ that they have in the cross is completely different as the ones we can see in most parts, I enjoy the old school chorus of the Cathedral, and I can tell that if you are looking for a place to meditate after mass or attend to one of the services, and feel welcome and on peace, that is the place to go.I baptized my little boy in the Cathedral and it was unique. Yes I will highly recommend it. And on the plus side if you go on the time of mass, you don’t have to pay for the parking that is inside the Cathedral, just a heads up, go ahead of time at least 30-45 minutes before so you can find parking, because that a lot of times is a headache.
Las misas en español son los días Domingos y son hermosas, si llegan unos 45 minutos antes de que empiece la misa es mejor porque así se estacionan dentro de la Catedral, y también de esta manera no pagan por estacionamiento, porque cobran cuando va uno solo de visita y no hay misa.</review>

<Text>A wonderful place to visit for a little meditation or quiet time. There is a lot of beautiful art in the Cathedral, so you may feel like you are in a museum too. You may even come for a mass and experience the acoustics of the place. Wonderful.</Text>< resp>

Visited the Cathedral of Our Lady Queen of Angels on Temple Street in downtown Los Angeles
For the presentation of the (.Class1 relic The Incorruptable Heart of St John Vianney )... Inside of the Cathedral is both spacious and Respectable.for Mass and Adoration Events This was especially. Moving and
Enlightening . Class 1 Relic for veneration after Mass Plenty of parking .in the attached structure. (seating and kneeling for 500+)
SJV was a great Priest and mystic he could tell a penitent
( One who goes to Confession
to confess his/her sins ) just what those sins were  (are ) and if they forgot any☺ a very moving experience for. Catholics
Very courteous Security Personnel and Knights of Colombus ..bathrooms clean and spacious .Plenty of benches in the . Adjoining Courtyard
Great experience St John Vianney
An Exemplary Catholic Priest for the Ages</text>

Whenever I come to LA, I always make sure to visit the cathedral. Its modern stylings do not detract from the reverential feeling of being in a place of worship. It is restrained and tasteful, with a nod towards the artistic.

The sense of space here is quite something - a real feeling of grandeur takes over when you enter the huge, high ceilinged chapel.

Tapestries, paintings and statues are here in plenty - there is so much to take in and see.

Very much worth a look if you're in the area... And best of all... It's free!< /review>

The church is very beautiful.  It is filled with great Christian art from various artists and very rich in history.  I love going to the church to express my faith and devotion to Christ.  Altho the church's shop keepers who worked on January 8, 2019 on the hours between 2:00 p.m. and 3:00  p.m. are racists pieces of trash.  When I entered the shop one of the workers a female yelled her greetings at me with an angry tone.  She was friendly with other Spanish speaking people.  Her eyes gazed at me through out the time I was there.   When I was checking out with my three red scapular necklaces the woman on the register turned around and commented "i thought it was a bird that takes things" I take that as a great offence, derogatory and disgusting.  As I completed my transaction, for I needed to get out of there for I know that feeling when the shop keepers have set the tone that you are not welcome, like that feeling of a colored person in the middle of the country where a White Supremacist owns the shop kinda feeling.  Its disheartening when the rise of discrimination is quite apparent specially if its affiliated with the Catholic church, and unfortunate when the people who has done such acts are people of color, you would think that being brown and Spanish speaking, in this relevant time, would be aware to not inflict bias, prejudice and coded racists actions and learn that it is simply wrong.  As I was leaving there was a Filipina woman that asked and inform on a reservation and the other lady working the till turned around and looked at her collegue and rolled her eyes.  It's beyond disgusting and very evil to set that atmosphere.  Specially infront of customers, and parishoners of the church.  Other people, just because they do not belong to your own national or ethnic background does not deserve less of respect.  I don't know if I would come back.</Review>

<text>The Our Lady of the Angels Cathedral is magnificent piece of architecture in DTLA.

The Cathedral is able to accommodate over 1000 people for mass. On the lower floor there is a separate chapel where you can pray more privately. In addition to the chapel,  there is also a mausoleum where some famous people are placed in the tombs. They also have a gift shop in the courtyard of the Cathedral.</text></record>

Very beautiful, modern cathedral. Take advantage of the 3 hour free parking when you go to mass to take a stroll through the cathedral and interesting architecture on Grand Ave (Walt Disney Concert Hall and The Broad).<//Review>

I'm very disappointed, I came to mass on a Tuesday at 12:30pm, so the parking lot is free for mass. So I came in 20 minutes earlier to be been on time and the security guard didn't allowed me to park for free.</Review>

It's a beautiful church and the park is very huge. It has a lot of history in this church. Located in the midst of downtown area, this church has been an icon to many tourists in town.<//Review>

<Text>What appears at first glance to be somewhere along the line of uninviting and perhaps too daring for a church soon invites the visitor to experience a space that offers feelings of both minisculity and comfort simultaneously. Upon entry, a slight ascent pulls the eye and body toward the nave, where the visitor is soon presented with an explosion of space.< /Text><Response>None</Response><Time>1517701482689< /Time><gmapID>0x80c2c651d95548c9:0x65e0ac4b47f3f069</gmapID><Name>Kevin Buckley<//Name>< rating>

Probably the most ugliest cathedral I've visited - at least the exterior. The tapestries of the Saints facing the altar is really cool. The tabernacle looks like lipstick.</review>

Great piece of architecture, from the integration of the plaza, stunning interior, to nice little sculptural details in the entrance...etc. Even if you are not religious, it's a sight to behold, well worth a visit</review>

(Translated by Google) Going to the Cathedral is a wonderful experience you breathe peace and tranquility, after visiting it inside and greeting our dear God, you can have a nice afternoon or morning sitting in the little square and visit the Gift Shoop where you can see so many beautiful things, the Girls who are super friendly who make me feel at home, I used to go very often before the pandemic but now things are starting to normalize I will visit her again I love to go !!!! I always buy some coins of Saint Michael the Archangel who is my guardian who I love very much
Hopefully the store is open tomorrow I'll call to see if I go

Ir a  la Catedral es una experiencia maravillosa se respira paz y tranquilidad , luego de visitarla por dentro y saludar a nuestro querido Dios , puedes tener una linda tarde o mañana sentada en la plazuelita y visitar el Gift Shoop donde puedes ver tantas cosas lindas , las chicas q atienden súper amables que me hacen sentir en casa , solía ir muy seguido antes de la pandemia pero ahora  q las cosas se están empezando a normalizar la iré a visitar de nuevo me encanta ir!!!! Siempre  compro unas monedas de San Miguel Arcángel q es mi guardián al que quiero mucho
Ojalá que la tienda esté abierta mañana llamaré para ver si voy</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It is very beautiful .. it is beautiful .. the only thing I do not like is that the priests give the Holy Eucharist in hand and do not even say the body of Christ ... everything is in silence and that does not make me feel good because I feel that our Lord Jesus Christ is disrespected.

(Original)
Es muy bonita..es preciosa..lo único que no me gusta es que los sacerdotes den la sagrada eucaristía en la mano y no dicen siquiera cuerpo de Cristo...todo es en silencio y eso no me hace sentir bien porque siento que se le falta al respeto a nuestro señor Jesucristo.<//Review></record>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It is the Cathedral of the Angels which was completed in 2002. Designed by Spanish architect Professor J. Moneo, the central entrance of the cathedral is a huge blue gate built by Robert Graham, with a statue of angels on the door. On both walls, there are 135 adultized tapestries from various ethnic backgrounds including Korean Daejon Kim from Korea. In the basement of the church there is an underground tomb and a crypt, which is the remains of the bishop of Los Angeles. The cathedral is also a temple and public place with various cultural facilities such as a theater and an exhibition hall. It is an ordinary cathedral from the outside, but it is really awesome if you go inside! The scale is big, but the splendor and beauty of the inside are really hard to express! Something solemn and ecstatic feeling, it is difficult to express in words. I will.

Moneo) 교수가 설계하였고, 성당의 중앙 입구는 로버트 그레이엄(Robert Graham)이 제작한 거대한 청동문이 있고 문 위에는 천사들의 모후 조각상이 있습니다. 양 벽면에 한국의 김대건 신부를 포함하여 다양한 민족출신의 135명의 성인화 태피스트리가  전시되어 있으며, 성당의 지하에는 지하묘과 납골당이 있는데 이곳에는 역대 로스앤젤레스 주교의 유해가 안치되어 있습니다. 또한 성당은 공연장, 전시장 등 각종 문화시설도 갖추고 있어 성전이자 대중적인 장소이기도 합니다. 밖에서 보면 평범한 성당인데, 안에 들어가면 정말 굉장합니다!! 규모도 크지만 내부의 화려함과 아름다움은 정말 말로 형용하기 힘들 정도입니다!! 뭔가 엄숙하면서도 황홀한 느낌, 말로 표현하기 어렵네요~ 강추!! 합니다.< /Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) You will be impressed by the quiet power, precision and bold surface composition of the space that cannot be seen in the photographs. The Gothic church is great, but it should also be a historic building. It is within walking distance from the Walt Disney Concert Hall, so we highly recommend visiting it.

(Original)
写真では伝わらない空間の静かな迫力と緻密さと大胆な面の構成で感動させられます。ゴシック様式の教会も素晴らしいですが、こちらも歴史に残る名建築になるはずです。ウォルト・ディズニーコンサートホールからも歩いて行ける距離にあるので是非見学お薦めします。</Review>

(Translated by Google) Our Lady of the Angels is a Catholic temple built with modern architecture that makes it a different cathedral from those that we are used to visiting in other places.
New materials, a very studied lighting and a sober and pleasant decoration make it a warm and spiritual place that is worth knowing if you visit the city of Los Angeles.

(Translated by Google) Looks like a mall / art gallery. The tabernacle, which is the most important place of every House of God, is hidden and not visible in the central place. Regret to look :(

Wygląda jak galeria handlowa/sztuki. Tabernakulum, które jest najważniejszym miejscem każdego Domu Bożego skryte i nie widoczne w centralnym miejscu. Żal patrzeć :(<//Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Awesome. It's worth seeing. Apart from being stone, modern, elegant and respectful as a Christian temple, banks have recliners. They are not seen because they are folded so as not to hinder when you are standing. It also has spaces for the disabled. The crypt is not similar to any other, illuminated, wide, pleasant.

(Original)
Impresionante. Merece la pena verla. Aparte de ser de piedra, moderna, elegante y respetuosa como templo cristiano, los bancos tienen reclinatorios. No se ven porque están plegados para no estorbar cuando estás de pie. También tiene espacios para discapacitados. La cripta no es parecida a ninguna otra, iluminada, amplia, agradable.<//Text>< name>

(Translated by Google) As far as I can see, they do not lend to the banks.

Or they expect the faithful to do penance while worshiping God. Or, as I suppose, they prefer not to kneel at Holy Mass.

Bad very bad. Gentlemen bishops (do you not want us to kneel before the Blessed Sacrament?

Whoever ordered, consented to these projects of modern churches, which are far from being a prayer in stone, away from God, and left there, to Him alone, sometimes in hidden Tabernacles, who built them and those who consented -and they paid for it-he wanted inhospitable places for God.

They will see. And that insulting exterior. Cubic, angular and full of terrible edges. It produces anguish. Rafael Moneo, how arrogant these modern architects, who are already very old. May God forgive you.

(Original)
Por lo que veo no ponen reclinatorios ante los bancos.

O bien esperan que los fieles hagan penitencia a la vez que adoran a Dios. O, como supongo, prefieren que no se arrodillen en la Santa Misa.

Mal, muy mal. Señores obispos(al  ¿acaso no desean que nos arrodillemos antes Cristo Sacramentado?

Quien ordenó, consintió estos proyectos de iglesias modernas, que están muy lejos de ser una oración en piedra, que alejan de Dios, y lo dejan allí, a  Él Solo, a veces en Sagrarios escondidos, quien las construyó y quienes lo consintieron -y lo pagaron-  deseaba lugares inhóspitos para Dios.

Ellos verán. Y ese exterior insultante. Cúbico, anguloso y lleno de terribles aristas. Produce angustia.  Rafael Moneo, cuánta soberbia estos arquitectos modernos, que ya son muy viejos. Que Dios les perdone.</Text>

Recommended for anyone who wants to be religiously concerned, quiet, hostile and sacred!

Please note that indoor parking is free during religious services.
Good visit!

(Translated by Google) From the outside, this building does not immediately remind you of a cathedral. The inside proves the opposite. Is only quite touristy which seems rather disturbing to the people who come there for what it is intended.

(Original)
Van buiten doet dit gebouw je niet meteen denken aan een kathedraal. De binnenkant bewijst het tegendeel. Is alleen vrij toeristisch wat mij nogal storend lijkt voor de mensen die er komen waarvoor het bedoeld is.< /text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Beautiful Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels ... Very mystical spiritual and solemn Mass ... A great musical organ with an extraordinary sound accompanying the Mass at all times ... Very wide cathedral, high ceilings altarpieces of Biblical passages to size from the wall .... On the altar the image of Christ always with a line of people to revere it ... Very comfortable seats, wide side aisles with images of Biblical history. At the exit of the Cathedral glass wall with the image of angels. And a large central square with garden and fountain, ample parking on the side ... and an environment full of spiritual wealth for the family ...

(Translated by Google) If you look at the exterior, you can see the building similar to MOCA, Walt Disney Hall, and Music Hall nearby, but it's hard to see in Catholic church. Even though it is a large cathedral, it is built faithfully to the purpose of the building, so you can feel godliness and relax. Once inside, it's a strange feeling to forget that it's a huge building. Designed by Spanish architect Jose Rafael Moneo, it was completed in 2002. You don't have to know about that.

(Original)
단순히 외관만 본다면 주변의 MOCA, 월트디즈니홀, 뮤직홀과 비슷한 목적의 건물이라 보여지겠지만 카톨릭에서는 좀처럼 보기힘든 대형건물의 성당임. 규모가 큰 대형성당임에도 건물의 목적에 충실하게 지어져 경건함을 느끼게해 주는 마음이 편안해지는 장소. 막상 내부에 들어가면 엄청난 크기의 건물이다라는것을 잊게만드는 묘한 느낌이 듦. 스페인 건축가 Jose Rafael Moneo가 설계, 2002년에 완공했다고 하는데 그런건 몰라도 되는거고, 종교를 떠나 잠시 들러 둘러봐도 괜찮은 장소.< /text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><Review>(Translated by Google) Los Angeles - (Spanish for "Angels", abbreviated LA, pronounced like Lazarus, also referred to as Los by Vietnamese in the surrounding areas) is the city The largest in California and the second largest in the United States, belongs to Los Angeles County. According to the 2000 Census, this city has 3,694,820 people. The surrounding areas of this city, also known as Southern California, include Los Angeles County, San Bernardino County, Orange County, Riverside County and Ventura County, which is one of the most populous places in the United States with 16 million people.

The city was founded in 1781 by the Spaniards in Mexico with the name El Pueblo de Nuestra de Reina de los Angel de la Porciúncula ("The town of the Queen of the Angels of the Porciúncula River" in the language. Spain, porciúncula means "small part"). In 1821 when Mexico gained independence from Spain, the city became part of that country. After the American-Mexican war, Los Angeles fell into the hands of the United States.

(Original)
Los Angeles - (tiếng Tây Ban Nha có nghĩa là “Những Thiên Thần”, viết tắt LA, phát âm như Lốt An-giơ-lét, còn được gọi tắt là Los bởi những người Việt ở những vùng lân cận) là thành phố lớn nhất tiểu bang California và lớn thứ nhì tại Hoa Kỳ, thuộc về Quận Los Angeles. Theo Thống kê dân số năm 2000, thành phố này có 3.694.820 người. Những vùng lân cận thành phố này, còn được gọi là Nam California, gồm có Hạt Los Angeles, Hạt San Bernardino, Hạt Orange, Hạt Riverside và Hạt Ventura, là một trong những nơi đông dân nhất Hoa Kỳ với 16 triệu người.

Thành phố được thành lập vào năm 1781 do những người Tây Ban Nha tại Mexico với tên là El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora Reina de los Ángeles de la Porciúncula (“Thị trấn của Đức Mẹ Nữ Vương của các Thiên thần của sông Porciúncula” trong tiếng Tây Ban Nha, porciúncula nghĩa là “phần nhỏ”). Vào năm 1821 khi Mexico giành độc lập từ Tây Ban Nha, thành phố này thành một phần của nước đó. Sau chiến tranh Mỹ-Mễ, Los Angeles lại rơi vào tay Hoa Kỳ.< /Review><username>Truong Truong Minh<//username><Time>1462373954027< /Time>< userid>

(Translated by Google) The cathedral on the outside does not invite you to visit it, but inside it is worth it, at least for Spanish visitors. The architect is Moneo, and he has done a great job. The stained glass windows are worth it, and the crypt. There are scenes of the evangelization of California, and San Junipero Serra appears. As part of the decoration of the cathedral there is a baroque altarpiece, from Ezcaray, whose presence in Los Angeles dates from 1927, and justify it to preserve it from the excesses of the civil war. The Americans have no choice, they lie without blushing and they justify everything, as well as the annexation of the different territories belonging to the Crown of Spain.

(Original)
La catedral por fuera no te invita a visitarla, pero por dentro merece la pena, al menos para visitantes españoles. El arquitecto es Moneo, y ha hecho un gran trabajo. Las vidrieras merecen la pena, y la cripta. Hay escenas de la evangelización de California, y aparece San Junipero Serra. Formando parte de la decoración de la catedral existe un retablo barroco, de Ezcaray, cuya presencia en Los Ángeles datan del año 1927, y justifican para preservarlo de los desmanes de la guerra civil. Los estadounidenses no tienen remedio, mienten sin ruborizarse y todo lo justifican, al igual que la anexión de los diferentes territorios pertenecientes a La Corona de España.< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Excelsa. Magnanimous It is an impressive structure. It is the largest in the US above that of New York. Too wide and with interiors full of light and space. Spectacular sound with its organ. It attends different languages ​​of masses and celebrations. The cafeteria even tastes good of food. What I do that fails is to want everyone to read the scores of music to sing together as the vast majority do not know how to interpret.

(Translated by Google) The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, which serves the largest Catholic diocese in America, replaced the Cathedral of St. Vibiana of 1876, which was damaged during the 1994 earthquake. It was designed by Spanish architect José Rafael Moneo between 1999 and 2002. The sand-colored, postmodern cathedral is made of exposed concrete.
The patronage refers to the Spanish city name Los Angeles (the Angels), which stands above the portal with a monumental figure "Our Lady of the Angels", a work by Robert Graham. The portrayal of the angel seems to me very interesting, differs considerably from the classical angelic pictures, and shows the woman with short hair wrapped in a simple long toga-like dress, her eyes closed and her drooping arms turned forward with the palms of her hands, as in the lower ones sinking. An impressive and powerful sculpture. An imaginary halo is formed by a hemispherical indentation behind her head.
From the entrance side and the highway, the central cross can be seen, which was designed as a concrete sculpture in the alabaster window of the altar area and illuminated at night. The architecture of the building is of interesting geometric design, clear forms showing an interleaving and in the roof area has a protruding cover in the front area.
The benches inside are grouped around the altar from three sides. Concentric circles in the floor run through the entire church like sound waves, which gives it a symbolic value. Side alabaster windows create a subdued daylight. Ten side chapels, among them the sacrament chapel, which is not visible from the main room, surround the nave.
The lower church of the cathedral was dedicated to funeral purposes. Here are personalities such as the actor Gregory Peck and June Marlow or the sculptor Robert Graham buried. Adjoining the mausoleum is a chapel where the relics of St. Vibiana, a 3rd century saint, are kept. They were transferred from the old cathedral.
A worth seeing object of the modern religious building, which does without a pompous Atributte and impresses the viewer.

(Original)
Die Kathedrale Unserer Lieben Frau von den Engeln, die der grössten katholischen Diözese in  Amerika dient, ersetzte die Kathedrale St. Vibiana von 1876, die während des Erdbebens von 1994 beschädigt wurde. Sie entstand nach Plänen des spanischen Architekten José Rafael Moneo in der Zeit zwischen 1999 und 2002. Die sandfarbene, postmoderne Kathedrale besteht aus Sichtbeton.
Das Patrozinium (Schutzherrschaft) nimmt Bezug auf den spanischen Stadtnamen Los Angeles (die Engel), die mit einer monumentalen Figur "Our Lady of the Angels", ein Werk von Robert Graham, über dem Portal steht. Mich dünkt die Darstellung des Engels sehr interessant, weicht sie von den klassischen Engelbildern doch erheblich ab und zeigt die Frau mit kurzem Haar in ein schlichtes langes togaähnliches Kleid gehüllt, die Augen geschlossen und die herabhängenden Arme mit den Handflächen nach vorn gedreht, wie in tiefer Versenkung. Eine eindrückliche und starke Skulptur. Ein imaginärer Heiligenschein bildet sich durch eine halbkugelartige Einbuchtung hinter ihrem Kopf.
Von der Eingangsseite und dem Highway aus ist das zentrale Kreuz erkennbar, das als Betonskulptur im Alabasterfenster des Altarbereichs gestaltet wurde und des Nachts beleuchtet ist. Die Architektur des Gebäudes ist von interessanter geometrischer Gestaltung, klare Formen die eine Verschachtelung zeigen und im Dachbereich eine vorstehende Abdeckung im Frontbereich aufweist.
Die Bänke im Innern gruppieren sich von drei Seiten um den Altar. Konzentrische Kreise im Fussboden durchziehen den gesamten Kirchenraum wie Schallwellen, was einen Symbolwert ergibt  Durch seitliche Alabasterfenster fällt gedämpftes Tageslicht ein. Zehn Seitenkapellen, unter ihnen die Sakramentskapelle, welche vom Hauptraum nicht ersichtlich ist, umgeben das Kirchenschiff.
Die Unterkirche der Kathedrale wurde für Begräbniszwecke gewidmet. Hier sind Persönlichkeiten wie etwa die Schauspieler Gregory Peck und June Marlow oder der Bildhauer Robert Graham beigesetzt. An das Mausoleum grenzt eine Kapelle, in der die Reliquien der heiligen Bibiana (St. Vibiana), einer Heiligen aus dem 3. Jahrhundert, verwahrt sind. Sie wurden aus der alten Kathedrale überführt.
Ein sehenswertes Objekt des modernen Sakralbaus, das ohne pompöse Atributte auskommt und dennoch den Betrachter beeindruckt.< /text>

(Translated by Google) I wish I could go to this church once, but it must be a bit far-fetched because I thought that I would never be able to go to the church once, in this church there are many good teachers, especially I like most of Bishop Barron.

(Translated by Google) It is difficult to recognize the church from the desolate appearance, and the cross is preserved next to the building. Welcome to the altar of the original St. Vibiana church. There is a magnificent marble mausoleum in the basement that is the last resting place of Gregory Peck's. Several languages ​​of the 5 million parish residents in the cathedral. I only visited a part. The photo is not clear after using the flash, no tripod can be used.

(Original)
從荒涼的外觀難以辨認出是教堂，建築旁保存着十字架。歡迎你進入原St. Vibiana教堂的祭壇。在地下室有個宏偉的大理石陵墓是Gregory Peck's 最後安息的地方。在大教堂里5百萬教區居民的幾種語言。我只参觀了一部分。使用閃光燈后照片不清晰，沒有三腳架可以使用。</Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I will be old but I do not like the modern cathedrals. They recommended us to go and see her and since we were there we decided to go and look for her. We almost passed by because the truth had nothing to do with a church ... Nose in my opinion did not catch my attention.

Seré antigua pero no me gustan nada las catedrales tan modernas. Nos recomendaron ir a verla y ya que estábamos por allí nos decidimos ir a buscarla.
