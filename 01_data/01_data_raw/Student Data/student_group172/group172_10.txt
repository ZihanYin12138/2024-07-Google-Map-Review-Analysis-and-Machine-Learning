I would give them 0 stars if I could. The large consomés i ordered were only half full, the garbanzos were undercooked and it had 0 flavor. Tasted watered down and was cold. Tortillas took long to come in and were cold. Meat has no flavor. I came in once before years ago. Same issues, very stingy with serving. Not coming back.</Text>

Lamb mole enchiladas are my favorite. One of the best spots in San Diego & very flavorful try them.</Text>

The place was very clean in appearance. The food was a little above average with good presentation. The chips and salsa were a bit of a disappointment because I was chips and pico like you get at most places; however, the 'salsa' is the same hot sauce they give you with your food... plus it was only a very small amount of chips. Main dish was tasty and came out very quickly (I was the only one in the restaurant). Very small menu... like, there isn't even tacos on the menu... kind of disappointed with the small menu and lack of options. Overall, the main dish was very good!< /Review>

<Review>We were anticipating a nice Mexican lamb meal, but were let down. The caldo seemed to be watered down and no noticeable seasoning and bland flavor. Next was the lamb meat for tacos, though it was perfectly cooked, it too was very bland (a little salt would have gone a long way). Finally, the lamb flautas, pretty good, generously filled tortillas, but again missing that special something. Nice lady helped us out, and everything was well packaged to go, I just feel flavor wise, it was an off day.<//Review>< Pics>

Authentic Mexican food with a relaxed home vibe. El Borrego has the best café de olla! I had about 2 cups so, yes unlimited refills. For breakfast I had the Huevos Rancheros and they didn’t disappoint. If you driven by it and said “hmm... that place looks good” I recommend that you eat here. They even have craft beer from Colima Brewing!!< /review>

Good portions for the price and delicious food. Huevos rancheros and mole chilaquiles remind me of home. Green and red salsa has great flavor too. Tortillas are warm and soft. Can't wait to come back and try other menu options.<//review>< pics>

<Review>Yummy home cooked chilaquilles with an egg for breakfast. They didn’t have green that early so we went for red. Homemade tortillas are fantastic. The 2 salsa options were both delicious. The red one has a nice full bodied spice to it as well.

Got 2 asada burritos to go. Ate them a few hours later once we got to our destination. Still bomb.

Looking forward to visiting again in the future!
The lady who helped us was very sweet. The place felt like we were eating straight out of a personal kitchen. Worth trying!</Review>< UserId.>

If you appreciate the taste of good, authentic mole try the mole chilaquiles! I opted for lamb and two eggs over easy. The mexican coffee, cafe de la hoya, was delicious and fresh. Greeted with big smiles, clean, excellent customer service! They serve fresh juice, orange, grapefruit and carrot. I will visit again soon.< /Text>

<Text>Simple looking place. Simple layout, looks like it is a fast food place! Order at the counter and then they bring it to your table. Nice. The menu is painted on the wall, and I suggest you love lamb if you come here. It is the specialty of the house. It is oh so tender and tasty. The salsa comes in two flavors and warm and hotter. I liked them both and found the warm  to be excellent and the hot was a bit hotter than I wanted. The hand made tortillas were excellent and were gobbled up promptly.
The dessert flan was excellent and greatly appreciated! All in all my cousin who is a local, now tells me that this a new favorite of hers! Were were all pleased and stuffed! Coming back soon, I hope!
oh yes, be patient, food is prepared in small batches and is oh so fresh and wonderful.< /Text><Rating>5</Rating>< Name>

<Review>The food it's good but this is not a kids friendly restaurant , in my last visit the owner made my kid feel bad , I have my kid very well educated and I always keep an eye on him specially on public places but it took 1 second of distraction of me for my kid to jump on the chair a he got grounded immediately by the lady sitting in one corner looks like she was starting at him the whole time, my kid felt shy and didn't know what to do, my kid was 4 years by then
I felt bad also because I see others kids and parents being irresponsible and it wasn't my case I was enjoying my kid being nice .it was a sour experience not going back</Review><userid>116479229667188315613< /userid>< gmapID>

<review>Love to eat here! First time I went was for posole, seems like not a lot of places make it. Their food is very tasty. I love the mole enchiladas with a fried egg on top. It is definitely my go to breakfast spot. The staff is very friendly, and if you dine in they will make sure everything is to your expectations.< /review></record></dataset><record>

When there's a big heavyset guy that's working behind there and cooking the food every time I eat that food from their place in the patent of the runs right away and be like I need to look for bathroom real quick before I go in my pants if I eat at that that's only it when the guy is cooking when there was a lady cooking it's actually pretty good food somewhat<//text>

I love El Borrego. It is a lovely, family owned, small business that serves authentic dishes. It may be a bit ‘pricey’ but you’re not paying for fast food, you are paying for a high quality meal made with care and served with love. Corny huh :)

I wish more people knew about this place! Their chilaquiles w mole on the weekends is THE BEST. They’re often sold out if I come for breakfast too late - that’s how popular it is. It also shows that breakfast 2pm on the weekends does NOT reward you with Mole Chilaquiles. Thank you El Borrego <3<//review>

One of the better places to eat in City Heights. Don't expect the typical greasy Mexican food here. The menu features  Southern style soups and lamb dishes in addition to the usual tacos, enchiladas, and nachos. You can't get a California burrito here--but try the Jimador burrito.</text>

I was very hopeful to visit this restaurant. I order sopes, Jamaica, and chips and salsa.  Jamaica did not have refills and the chips were stale.  The sopes were okay but not much meat.  Service was just OK.  I will not be returning.</review>

<Review>Absolutely some of the best authentic Mexican food you can get your hands on this side of the border!  Ran by a beautiful and friendly family who genuinely loves to create delicious food.  It shows in the product!  The mole is amazing, their lamb Barbacoa is out of this world! Their Hibiscus juice is amazing and they do serve beer which is great as well! It was here that I first became obsessed w pork Pibil!</Review>< pictures>

<Name>Chris Chart</Name><userid>112801376615962670237</userid><Text>I Joined the local YMCA across the street, and I was looking for a place to get breakfast after a morning swim.  El Borrego is right across the street.  Oh lord, good bye burned off calories, hello carne asada breakfast burrito.  First impression, the place was full of locals, a bunch of regulars, and it smelled awesome.  They make everything themselves, it takes longer.  I waited 20 minutes for my food but watching everyone else's properly prepared meals I was more excited than grumpy/hungry.  It was well worth the weight.  The carne asada was perfect.  Carne asada juice got all up in the homemade tortilla, but it wasn't greasy or messy, it was just a great quality cut of meat.  Everything was super fresh.  I swear the cilantro and onion must be fixed for each because it has not been cut for more than a few minutes.  Rice and beans were cooked vegetarian style, no lard, rice was firm but not overly so, beans were tasty.
Really great all around.  Can't wait to try the lamb, before you get mad, they also serve vegetarian and vegan dishes, but I love lamb tacos.  The staff was great, you can tell they put passion into the food, this place is legit.   Filling, but made with fresh ingredients so I actually don't feel sluggish after eating the entire burrito.  Definitely a fan.  Will post pictures after next visit.  Thank You</Text>< Pics>

Amazing Food. My girlfriend is very picky when it come to "Mexican Home Cooking." Her mother and her are both amazing cooks and actually it gets a little annoying always hearing how her Mom's beans or her Mom's Sope is so much better than whatever Mexican food we usually try in town. This is the FIRST place where sh'e too busy eating the great food to compare to her Mom's! The Lamb Quesadillas and The Chilaquiles are some of my favorites here. They also have amazing soups and the Enchilada's are sooo good. Basically, you can't go wrong with whatever you order, The cooks and Servers are very friendly and always are willing to suggest something to order if you can't decide.  Also don't forget to try the Coffee, OK Im gonna shut up now, This is definitely my new favorite breakfast spot.< /review>

Lamb chilaquiles hardly had any lamb. 12.25$ overpriced for chilaquiles with a small amount of beans and hardly any lamb. Very disappointed.</text>

Their food is good. but expensive also they give a little bit of the consome like it's just water in the plate no garbanzo beans or rice in it basically just the soup water. Needs improvement< /Text>

<Text>The food is so delicious and tastes authentic. As close as you can get to home cooked. My favorites so far are the Chicken mole enchiladas, chilaquiles and horchata. Lamb especial is okay, the lamb taco and quesdilla are delicious. While the cactus salad and rolled taco are forgettable. Mixiore Of Berrego is delicious but over priced. Borrego burrito is okay, a little lackluster.</Text>< rate>

Horrible! Food is naaaasty and cold. Worst customer service. Restaurant owner charges for everything. Ships and salsa $2.40. (by the way ships taste stale) and if you want more chips and salsa, they charge $1.75. I ordered Chilaquiles verdes (should be named Water with a splash of green color). It had no flavor. OVERALL just nasty. Don't waste your time and money.<//text>

They have definetly gained a new Customer, if you are looking for some good old Mexican breakfast this is the place to go, It is not pricy at all So you wont need to worry about it Being way out of your Budget. Parking is a lil harsh but The walk back to the car will do you good.< /Review>< pics>

Very friendly atmosphere. Was welcomed as soon as we walked in and the waitress was very helpful. I ordered the chicken enchiladas in green sauce and a cochinita pibil taco and both were really great and full in flavors! Was very satisfied with my food and also was my husband. We both reacommend it.<//Review>

This isn't your run in the mill little Mexican food stop. The menu and resturant maybe small, but the atmosphere makes you feel like you're visiting family. All the staff I have seen so far are ladies. Majorily women who are moms, so you know you're going to have the mommas touch when digging in. I can't say which dish is best. However, if you never had actual mexican breakfast then start with having chilaquiles since it is very simple and tasty. Finding parking can be a hassle so be prepared to walk if you don't score the spots in front.<//Review>

<name>Paul C</name><Text>El Borrego is supposed to be mexican food prepared in a traditional way vs the normal fast food experience.  I like it but it is considerable more expensive.  I will visit more often as finances permit.  I have a small issue with consistency.  Sometimes I am really wow'ed by the meal and other times it is just Ok verses excellent.  I want the same wow experience ever time ideally with ever item that I order.  But I can live with it as it is and plan to return again soon.  Also, atmosphere feels cozy, warm and caring.< /Text>< pics>

Great place! Super-fresh Mexican food with vegan options. House-made tortillas, house-soyrizo, fresh guacamole, fresh Juice(!)-- love this place!
Here's what we order for our "Build Your Own Amazing Vegan Tacos" spread for 2 people:
2 orders of Tortillas (3 tortillas/order)
Then a side of each of these:
Beans
Rice
Guac
Soyrizo
It comes with 2 great salsas, and a bowl of fresh Cilantro & onion.
Add a fresh Juice (breakfast), Tamarindo or Jamaica (lunch), or a local beer (dinner).
Before you go: Check the hours.They do close early, and close Mondays<//review>

The menu is very limited. We shared a carne asada burrito. The kid at the register said the burrito was huge. Not true. It was average in size and in taste. We also ordered chips and guacamole. The chips were stale and it was the smallest serving of guacamole, especially for $6.00! We asked for pico de gallo and they wanted to charge for that. Needless to say we will NOT be back.<//Text>< rate>

Mexicanos autentico! Got to try the ensalada nopales. You are starting to see nopales (cactus) on menus. This dish is reminiscent of ceviche with a lime dressing but green. Very tasty.< /text>

(Translated by Google) The enchiladas of moles terrible are of mole doña Maria I paid for something that I hoped was more homemade for the next I bought the same mole and I prepare it in my house my friend asked. Two more tortillas for your food and charged .50 c for each tortilla is fine, there was no problem, it burns me up, it is the owner, an old lady who out of respect, I do not take a picture but she is the only one who is there charging and taking care apart from his daughter
I saw her shouting at one of her employees to the degree that made her cry telling her with these words .. Move the kid for that I pay not to waste time without saying that the other lady who told you are in the United States INDIA. Speak well. On my part, I will not go to that place again, neither I nor my friends, since I understand that she started with a stand. They are also bone warriors of Mexican origin and that they treat our own race so badly and have repeatedly gone and I always have a bad taste in my mouth when listening to this lady and always with new employees because with that character I think they can not stand it
# very bad food
# very expensive
# prepotent
# discriminating
Out of respect I did not say anything because I repeat is a lady of legal age
I would never work with such a pattern. It is true we need work but it is not to be treated worse than slaves

Las enchiladas de moles pésimas son de mole doña maria pague por algo que esperaba fuera más casero para la próxima me compro el mismo mole y lo preparo en mi casa mi amiga pidió. Dos tortillas más para su comida y le cobraron .50 c por cada tortilla está bien no hubo problema  lo quemas me molesto es la dueña una señora ya grande a la cual por respeto No le tome foto pero es la única que está ahí cobrando y atendiendo aparte de su hija
La vi gritándole a una  de sus empleadas al grado que la hizo llorar diciéndole con estas palabras   .. Muévete chamaca que para eso e pago no estés perdiendo el tiempo sin decir que a la otra señora la que le dijo estás en Estados Unidos INDIA. Habla bien    De mi parte no volveré a ir a ese lugar ni yo ni mis amistades ya que tengo entendido que ella empezó con un puestecito  además son de guerrero ósea de origen Mexicanos y que traten así de mal a nuestra propia raza  e ido en repetidas ocasiones y siempre me queda mal sabor de boca al escuchar a esta señora y siempre con empleadas nuevas porque con ese carácter creo que no la aguantan
# muy mala comida
# muy caro
# prepotente
# discriminadora
Por respeto no le dije nada por que repito es una señora de mayor de edad
Jamás trabajaría con un patrón así. Es verdad necesitamos el trabajo pero no es para que nos traten peor que esclavos<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The food is delicious!
The only thing I give it 3 stars for is because it is always a problem to find parking 😒, on such a busy street. They should have an additional parking space.

(Original)
La comida es riquísima!
Lo único por lo q le doy 3 estrellas es porq siempre es un problema encontrar estacionamiento 😒, en una calle tan transitada. Deberían tener un lugar para estacionarse adicional.< /review>

<review>Have to agree unfortunately with some of their recent reviews. I really wanted it to work out as I assume the same with all of these companies that pay them. When you first sign up they mention some of their bad reviews they've received and mentioned the customer had unrealistic expectations. Well I can speak on behalf of my company, we had a couple bucks to try it out and very little expectations, still pretty much a joke. They do less than the minimum. Spent a lot of money. ZERO return. I think their concept is more about making a quick buck vs. really helping companies grow.< /review>< Pictures>

It has been amazing having the opportunity to work with Hawke and their team. After bouncing around a couple agencies, I was blown away with Hawke Media. Ralph, their director of growth is helpful, diligent, and always available. The performance of the marketing team continues to amaze. They are incredibly talented and always up to date on the newest trends. If you are looking to outsource your marketing you will not find a better team for the money. PLUS, their a la carte business model means you aren’t paying for anything you don’t need. Highly recommend!!< /text>

Extremely disappointed in Hawke Media! Prior to hiring them, I had successfully ran ads but had little time to manage them. Thought I'd hire a "professional" team to offload the work... Oh, how I was wrong...

They ran the ads for two months, me pointing out multiple of their rookie (account manager assigned) mistakes throughout the process.

I understand that results are not guaranteed and am completely fine with that but the overwhelming horrendous work they've done is completely unacceptable.

Absolutely no activity from the few ads they've launched and tweaked for over two months. Seemed like a bunch of amateurs work there. They did not deliver on the agreement that they put in place. Have not met deadlines they set. Furthermore, the multiple phases of work to be completed they put in place have not been completed in a timely manner and some not completed at all.

I paused the payment and asked them to complete the agreed upon work before I pay them again. Their amateur response was "we will not do any work until payment is made" REALLY? I paid you for work, please complete it!

I have then tried to connect with them by phone, email and postal mail, have made 15+ attempts. There has been absolutely no response to my emails. No call backs for the voice messages I left. When I was able to connect with their tech support department & explained the situation, the promised call backs never took place.

At this point I gave up... Not worth my time... I would highly discourage anyone looking into hiring Hawke Media.

Hawke Media Offers Poor Quality
Hawke Media Offers Poor Value
Hawke Media Is Not Professional
Hawke Media Is Not Responsive

I have a complete timeline of events with proof of the communication and the ridiculous responses and (lack of response) via emails, calls, postal mail as well as account performance stats before and after hiring them for anyone doubting this review.<//Review>

<review>This agency is the worst out there. Not only do they not follow direction, they waste your money. Can’t follow directions on target or ad copy. Have to follow up for them constantly to make sure they actually do what you’re paying them to do.< /review>< pics>

I have been working with Hawke for the last 2 months and i am thus far extremely pleased with the level of communication their team as provided me. I am using them for our internal affiliate and email management part of their services.  There follow-up and responses to my emails are fantastic, i am yet to have any complaints regarding their team. I have been through 10+ media agencies and have yet to find a company with the level of communication this company offers. I will follow up with results as time progresses.<//Text>

<Text>Hawke has been a fantastic business partner for Alterna's digital department.; I could not have asked for a better more supportive and responsive team. I am always impressed with what they are able to do in often times tight budgets and the exposure they have created for our brand in such a short amount of time. Thank you to their knowledge and ability we have grown our brand significantly across digital and web. I truly enjoy working with them and having them as an agency partner. They are not only talented but a much appreciated partner for this mighty little brand. I would highly recommend them to anyone in need of great service and talent.<//Text>< pics>

Super disappointed. This has really affected our cash flow. I do not believe the reporting is accurate at all. Very expensive monthly cost plus we spent thousands on ads and the returns the claimed do not match up at all. They claimed revenue that was NOT theirs to claim. Though the staff is very friendly and convincing the numbers are a total loss!!< /review>

<Review>Simply put, we love our Hawke Media team! Chris handles our content marketing needs with skill, diligence, insight and efficiency. Our weekly check-in meetings are carefully planned and communicated. I've been amazed at how quickly & thoroughly Chris and his team have educated themselves in our varied and complicated industry.  We have also used Hawke for special projects from time to time designing infographics and collateral materials. They are the best!< /Review><gmapID>0x80c2a4d3b0b78c35:0x70e03cf01db1ab0</gmapID>< resp>

In 25 years of successful business ownership, I have NEVER found a company as honest, helpful and effective as Hawke Media!  Let me explain:

I was having an issue getting my new company "approved" as an advertiser in Facebook / Instagram and I turned to Hawke Media to for help with not only getting this approval taken care of, but also to manage my social media and online marketing so that I could focus on the critical aspects of my business.  For more than a year prior to calling Hawke, I had built a multi-million dollar App for the sole purpose of advertising it on the Facebook and Instagram platforms.  Never in a million years would I have guessed that after my app was finished and included in both the Apple and Google play stores, that my app would NOT be approved with Facebook/ Instagram.  THIS WAS DEVASTATING!!! I tried for nearly a year to get Facebook to respond to us as to why we were denied  or what we could do to fix it and to my frustration, I got no where and more shocking, I wasn't even getting messages back to my questions or concerns from Facebook.

I contacted Hawke and spoke to a man named "Max Finke" and told him about my app and explained to them both my issues as well as what I needed in terms of a marketing partner to ensure that my new app was going to be successful.  After our initial call, Max told me that I would get a call back with their thoughts on how they could assist with my marketing, but first they wanted to see if they could help me get approved for Facebook Marketing.  Within 2 weeks, Max sent me an email letting me know that Hawke Media had worked behind the scenes to get my App Approved and that we were good to go forward with marketing!  I could NOT believe my ears.... But wait, there is more to this....

The MOST unbelievable part of this review is that without Hawke Media and their team, MILLIONS of dollars and nearly 2 years of mine would have been flushed down the toilet and when I asked Max how much I owed them for getting my company back on track after ALL HOPE was LOST.....   His told me that we did NOT owe them anything and that they were happy to help me!!!

WHAT COMPANY WOULD DO THAT?  The only thing they knew about me was my Company Name and my account information with Facebook.  They did not take a credit card up front.  They did not make promises or guarantees to me and they did not give me stipulations that I would owe them anything if they could get me approved.  Are you kidding me??  I could have walked away and never done a single dollar worth of business with Max Finke or Hawk Media and let me tell you something, that is very rare in this day in age!

Marketing has Begun... Lets talk about what happened next:

After my approval to advertise on Facebook the COVID-19 Crisis hit the globe.  My marketing budget was obliterated, my other companies were virtually destroyed and the future of not only my app, but my life (like so many others) were left up in the air.  I called Max Finke to let him know that although I had no words for how grateful I was for them helping me get my company back on track, I was in serious trouble and I am going to need to hold off on any big marketing plans that I was planning.  Max's response was, "Brian, that is not a problem and we are here when you are back on your feet."  Again... This is unbelievable to me that this company had done so much for me and here they are again, genuinely caring about my situation and doing what they could to keep me positive.

After that call, I decided that I would invest in a minimum budget and with the help of Maddie Marten, Max Finke and the Hawke Media Team...

I can honestly say that the results I have seen are ABSOLUTELY OFF THE CHARTS INCREDIBLE and I foresee my company becoming a massive success thanks mostly to them!

If you took the time to read this, then I know you are serious about your company and taking it to the moon.  Let me tell you that if you want results and you want the help of a team of people that TRULY care about you and your company, you have come to the right place!  Call them.</text>

We’ve been working with Hawke for the past year and have had an incredible and fun experience. Our digital marketing presence has grown significantly since we've outsourced a lot of our marketing to their team. It’s been great to work with Hawke we’re very happy with the quality of work they provided.< /review>

<review>Their audit was great, but as the engagement progressed, they acted like an external agency without much accountability for the results and we weren’t able to leverage them to move the needle for us. If you need basic strategy advice, they might be a great fit for your needs. If you need them to execute or manage any projects, I would look elsewhere.

Additionally, they charged us $6000 for for the following month’s services, 8 days after disengaging with them. Essentially we paid for 38 days worth of services that we never were able to use due to fine print in the contract. When they stated that we needed to provide 10 days notice, we then asked Hawke if we could use the extra month of services that we paid for and we got no reply after multiple attempts. We left on good terms initially, but the accounting department kept the $6000 of unused time, which is a big deal as a small business. Buyer beware.

UPDATE 8/26:  Hawke's customer success team reached out to me regarding this review to see what they could do to get me to change the review.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

As a startup coming out of stealth mode in 2018, Hawke Media was instrumental in helping us formalize our digital marketing programs for paid search, SEO and content.  The Hawke team, encompassing each of these areas, quickly accelerated the performance of these demand generation activities. We would certainly recommend Hawke for those companies who need help getting started, or existing brands to revisit current programs for effectiveness.</Review>

<Review>Terrible experience. We paid 13k for nothing.

Facebook ads: our income decreased 30% with them. Every “optimization” was worse than the last one. Even facebook support said the ads were not running well. They said we had to wait 2 or 3 months to see the results, because they had to start from scratch. A total nonsense because our ads were performing well and we already had a lot of data. They tell you to be patient in order to lock you into the next month.

Email: after one month we didn’t see any execution. Literally nothing.

We asked for a refund for the second month that we didn’t use, and they said that they couldn’t do that because they have a 30 days cancellation policy, which means you have to sign the contract for the first month and immediately cancel, otherwise you’ll be charged automatically for the second month. Terrible business practice. So shady.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Hawke has been a fantastic addition to our marketing & ecommerce team. While they are technically an outsourced digital agency, they are truly committed to our success - operating, strategizing and executing as a vested team member. They are experts in digital and brand marketing. The icing - they're also a fun group of people to work with!< /Review>

Not only does Hawke Media produce quality work but they give personal attention and care to each client. It's very rare for an agency to have a month-to-month model - allowing clients to leave at no additional cost if they're unhappy for any reason. Hawke opens up the opportunity for professional data-based marketing to so many growing businesses.</Text>

~No approvals for app installation. Yes, they installed a web app without our approval! We noticed when our sales dropped significantly and when we researched the issue we figured out the problem. Apps slow down websites and impact the customer experience.

~Adwords: We purchased the lower level management fee option of $2k per month based on a monthly ad spend of $1-$10k. This was great because our current ad spend was just under $1k, and we fell within this service level for managing our existing account.

Here are their rates with no fine print on spending.
$1-$10,000, 2k management fee
$10,001-$25,000 20% of monthly add spend
$25,001-$50,000 15% of monthly add spend
$50,001+             10% of monthly add spend

So you can imagine our surprise when the media team, without consulting us, upped our adword spend and we received a $4k+ CC bill. When we asked what happened ~ they said they had carte blanche to spend up to $1-$10k when we signed up for the 2k management fee. Would you have assumed based on the rates above that they could spend whatever they wanted? What about on the $50,001+ no end in sight monthly ad spend? To me, it read as a service level agreement where we choose the budget, & they'll manage the spend. We would have never approved a 4k spend. As a small business, this was crushing.

~Mailchimp campaign work was a mess (and that's putting it mildly).  From promotional codes not being programmed, follow-up newsletter campaigns not being scheduled, and reminder emails not being complete, we ended up spending more time managing this then just doing it ourselves, and the creative was just underwhelming.

~Their webwork needed webwork (lots of examples here, let's just say hard pass).

~Strategy. If you don't know your demographic or competitive landscape, then they'll figure this out and do a wonderful job presenting it. If you know all about your company + competitors, pass on strategy. They won't put out a sales plan to increase your numbers, just tell you all about your business - which is fine if you don't know yourself and want to get to know yourself.

~Billing. They are saying we have a 334.62$ bill outstanding for 3rd party services (that we were not using at the time). You'd think after their 4k unapproved media spend, unauthorized app download, mail chimp failures, they would just waive it, with a "we will try to do better next time". Instead they are sending us emails threatening us with legal action plus attorney's fees.

What we liked! Thus the additional star.

~Katie, the adwords developer was wonderful to work with. Be sure to manage your own budget, and come up with your own strategy.
~Graphics were great.
~James, the account guy, was groovy.</text>

Incredible experience working with the Hawke Media team. They helped build my shopify site, email marketing strategy and execution, as well as SEO and Facebook ad spend. Overall their efforts led to a steady increase in conversion rate and overall revenue. Madison helped every step of the way and was a joy to work with! Highly recommend for business development and growth for companies of all sizes.<//text>

<Time>1506062802979<//Time><rate>5</rate><review>Please ignore Mark Aramli's 1-star review. His description of his experience is way off base and full of inaccuracies.

To start, I want to dispel Mark's implication that I left Hawke because of anything to do with the team. He says, "(Houston) who was inadequatly supported by his support teams. He left the company."

To me, this is the most upsetting part of his absurd review. My decision to leave Hawke was quite possibly the hardest decision I've made in my professional career.

I left Hawke because I had to seize the opportunity of a lifetime to start a company with an amazing co-founder and the power of the BAMF community backing us. Even with this dream opportunity, deciding to leave the support of my Hawke team made the decision personally painful. Hawke has a culture - a real culture built on friendship and hard work. It's super talented, creative, and driven marketers that makes "The Nest" a haven for digital mavens.

Every member of my BedJet Hawke team - from web design to photography to media buying - produced amazing results on tight budgets for a tense client. Unfortunately, the client wasn't used to streamlining the approval process for all the great work we were doing, so a lot of it never saw the light of day.

Lastly, Mark has failed to mention anything we did for on the PR side of things. During the last 3-months, we filled his pipeline with more than 50 PR opportunities in top publications, podcasts, and pages such as Inc., Entrepreneur, Digital Trends, TechCrunch, BuzzFeed, Mixergy, CNN and many more.

Thought I'd do my part to set the record straight.

Sincerely,
Houston</review>< pics>

This is a STAY AWAY warning for companies looking for a quality digital marketing agency -- Hawke Media does not live up to the hype.

I am the CEO of my company and we employed Hawke for our fast growing and successful ecommerce business for six moths in the first half of 2017.   Our company has great ecommerce metrics and is doubling sales year over year -- although none of that could be attributed to work from Hawke.  We fired them after six months for the following reasons:

1)	Inadequate bandwidth applied to all our account services – not a responsive agency by our standards in terms of communications.  Workflow and implementation on everything was slow.
2)	Incompetent, grossly negligent, sloppy work on our paid advertising (facebook primarily) with repeated errors after requesting corrective action be made.  These were errors in copy, bad links, and rookie mistakes in setting up the Ads.
3) Inability to manage to a clearly specified customer budget on Facebook Ads --- without our constant watchfulness, they would have blown way past our requested budget.
3)	Photoshoot services that weren’t organized well with one of the major photo shots totally blown due to lighting errors, and many shots never being made due to running out of time (for poor organization of the day)

Basically every basic digital marketing agency service we used them for was a complete disappointment.  Hawke Media was simply unable to offer quality comprehensive services to us as a new client, and this was after several "course correction" meetings with their management (although we were never able to get any of the partners on the phone with us, even though we asked multiple times).

We operated at a net loss with Hawke Media for the six months we’ve were under contract with them.  This came with a huge opportunity cost of losing six months of our business year where we could have been with another agency that actually brought value to our business.

I have physically visited and toured their offices in the beginning of our work with them.  While I believe some of their earlier clients have gotten value from them (we spoke with one as a referral before hiring), Hawke Media has suffered from being too successful with their own self promotion.  They have grown too fast as an agency with very poor management and quality control.

Our experience was defined by inadequate bandwidth applied to everything we paid for couples with sloppy work and inexperience people on our account.  I don't believe this is an isolated experience for newer clients at this agency.  I can't recommend them based on our experience.<//Text>

This is a freaking amazing skate park, built by amazing people, surrounded by an amazing landscape, in honor of an amazing human. Volcom out did themselves with this one. I rolled around here the other day, first time since I had toes amputated and it felt great. On any sunny, dry day, you'll find talent and lines that you can't find anywhere else! 🙌👊<//review>

Rad skatepark! The bowl is massive and so fun and beautiful! I love rollerskating here. There’s always really good older skatedads and young little skatekids that are so impressive. Good vibes all around.< /Text>

If only every town was fortunate enough to have a skate park like this. This park is big and has some HUGE features. The park definitely matches the riding ability of a lot of the local talent. Everyone is good about getting to drop in and super friendly. 10/10</text>

We have not been to enough skate parks, maybe a dozen or so.

This was by far the best outdoor park we have ever been to.  It was clean, huge in size and features.

If you are visiting Mammoth you need to take your kids here.

It is free as well with restrooms and playground equipment.  Along with plenty of seating and bleachers to watch.<//review>

< Review>
I love this park so much, its so flowy and unique, made for skaters but i ride scooters and they let me ride, this park was made after a pro snowboarder Jeff Anderson had a accident in japan and passed...this park was built in memory by his mother.<//Review>

Would be 5 stars if they allowed BMX. Took a roadtrip to hit all the best skateparks and was kicked out after I was allowed to do one backflip... at least that part was fun..< /Review>

<Review>Just drove to Fresno from the Bay Area in my new car and got a screw in it. Just happened to look up from departing the CVS and pulled in to see if the Goodguys could repair my tire as I saw a screw in the center. The managing partner, Ryan Schmal, was amazing. Very professional and stated that there would be no charge to plug the tire which would take about 30 minutes. The associate that did the work was prompt, efficient and very careful with my new car. Upon leaving the store Ryan even gave me a book about the founder of the company. I HIGHLY recommend this business for your tire needs and more. Thank you to everyone there.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Time>1606798151454<//Time><Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>My family has been going to this shop for years. The old manager was very nice and always helpful. Where we live, our tires get more wear and we drive quite a bit. I went in alone in for a tire rotation and an oil change. Oil change was about $80 (I thought it was overpriced) and they would not rotate my tires for me. They said that the front tires had too much wear and it was unsafe to do rotate. Front tires were barely worn down and only about a year old. I asked them to rotate anyways and they refused. Other family members have had this issue before but they will rotate them anyways. As a 20-something female, I think that they figured that I did not know any better. I will be taking my money elsewhere.<//review>< rate>

<text>My grandson's girlfriend took her car to Goodguy's on Herndon in Clovis for tire rotation which is a no charge and oil change. 7 hours later the bill was $1000. Horrible leaks, oil pressure etc. they told her. These good guys need to change their name to the Badguys.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Called them to get an alignment and tire rotation quote, they gave a good price and told me to bring my vehicle in right then and there. Started with the alignment and then once they removed everything they let me know how low my brake pads were so I was offered their brake package which resurfaced my rotors, better than OEM pads and now my vehicle drives absolutely smooth. I have a Jeep Wrangler with mud tires on it and the services they provided were long overdue, she (Jeep) definitely needed it and she's never driven smoother.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>The guy ( Tim ) tried charging me insurance and mount And balance on 4 tires when I only was buying two. Acted like I was stupid for questioning what he said. The next day when I came to get my tires put on. It took over 4 hours to mount balance 2 tires and put them on the car and aligned. I feel like they worked on other cars or were just lazy. Would not go back.<//Text><time>1578433601678< /time></record>

< Review>
I came in for a tire repair.  It wasn't very busy and I was told that it would take 40 minutes.  After 40 minutes, a gentleman sat down next to me to go over what all he discovered was wrong with my car that didn't have anything to do with the tire.  Then he told me that it would be another 40 minutes until my car was ready!  Evidently, they don't work on your car at all until the "milker" finds other things wrong with your car in order to get you to spend more money.  I was there for 1-1/2 hours!  When I got home, my husband informed me that they WAY over charged for a simple puncture fix.  They are NOT the good guys!!!  They are NOT there to service you, they are there to see how much money they can get out of you!<//Review>

Great repair job. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

When it comes to your car, you hope to find a place that understands how stressful car repairs are. They explained everything, discussed options, and suggested a plan for accomplishing my repairs. 😀

I took my 2018 Highlander in four tires, after the tires were put on they went to go and do an alignment.  They said I need new bolt because they couldn’t do the alignment.  They showed me a picture of what needs to be fix.  It was a phono of my stabilizer bar.  I told them I will take it into Toyota because it’s under warranty.  He was trying to get $150 or $170 out of this job.  Again I told him it’s under warranty.  I will never go back even though I have free rotation and balancing.  Scam artist and if they undid anything from factory they will get the bill from Toyota<//Text>

Such great service!! Made me aware of the special they had going on for tire alignment instead of charging me full price. Then gave me a discount coupon. So saved me almost 50$. I definitely plan on using this service again. Five stars!<//Review>

<review>I came in to have my brakes lights fixed. Four and a half later hours later, they replaced A light with no charge.... for a $110!  They tried to tell me my windshield wipers needed to be replaced, I said hum that's funny because I just had them replaced a few weeks before!?!  I took it to another Goodguys store, Brownrigg on Ashlan, turns out that it was a mechanism underneath the brake that was causing my brake lights to stay on at all times.  Thank you Brownrigg for being honest and not charging me an arm and a leg for a repair. This Goodguys store are not honest and are NOT good guys!  Go anywhere else!!!!!!!!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I cannot speak for the service because I refused to use it but I can only share my experience with the check in service. I had my new tires and I needed only the labor to install them on my car. So I called to book an appointment and ask for the cost. The person who answered the phone told me 60$ to have my tires changed. When I checked in, the bill was over 100$ and I refused to have my tires changed at this shop.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

< Review>
It was awful. Being a little gal, I've definitely had my share of being "hustled"...the same applies here.
I went in to get new brakes, By Myself. I waited in the lobby while they did the work. After a handful of other costumers had come-n-gone, they FINALLY completed the task.... 4. Hours. Later.
Not Only did they steal my large mag-lite flashlight I had under the seat, but now, 3 MONTHS later, my breaks SQUEAK SO Much Louder than they did when I took them in to be replaced. ....Breaks lasting 3 months?? Sneaky Cheats.
Thank goodness for warranties!! Let's see what happens This time....

So, No- I Would Not suggest this location To Anyone.<//Review>

I called up in advance to see how much to put on my 4 new tires I bought from Amazon. When I get there, the manager (he looked like the manager) never bothered to ask me what I wanted done. After wasting 30mn I got an estimate for 699$ including a new alignment. He didn't even see my new tires I have sitting in the back seat and he recommended an alignment even before anyone has taken a look at the old tires. I will never go back . The Good Guys didn't turned out to be so good after all.< /Text>

Go to Firestone or anywhere else! Now I'm stuck with tires that aren't good, one flat and $200 to fix it!

Called and talked to TIM. I explained I was crunched for time and budget... Rather than have me come in and try and squeeze a sale out of me for a new rim, he said the price I was quoted to repair it would be the cheapest... That is what I needed to hear, or I would have spent more hours calling other places .<//review>

She left and 10 miles later dashboard lights were coming on (which is when I got the call).  I figured out they had disconnected a vacuum line and told her to go back there right away.  They confirmed that they had knocked a hose off when checking the air filter.  Unintentional?  Doesn't matter - the scare was already done and they could have probably raked it in if someone hadn't been watching out for her.  I'll never understand why these shops tend to take advantage of people.  They did put it back on, but my suggestion to her, and to anyone else is to be wary of these "good guys" - they're not.</text><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

horrible place. there nothing but crooks who dont know much. i went in with questions about my non working headlight. they charge per the hour. it took them over an hour before they got to it and i was charged for it just sitting in the parking lot then they told me it was a list of problems amounting to a large sum of money if i wanted it done correctly. the catch was i had to buy my new lights elsewhere. after i purchased non refundable lights i took a look for myself and saw the the issue was a fuse. the lights i purchased didnt need to be used! i went back very upset and asked to have my money back. they said no that i was charged for a inspection but the inspection wasnt done correctly and was faulty. i asked them again to tell me what the issue was and after the gave me the wrong info i showed them the fuse and all they said was "oh". the manager refused to give me a refund and was very rude about after he eeven knew he was wrong. DONT GO HERE THERE ARE HONEST AND CARING PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP BESIDES THESE CROOKS!< /Text>

Be ready to pay 35% more on liquor and other  specialty items. Be ready to pay $1.00 more than the going rate on gas.   Water & propane is about $14  for a  7lb tank .  It is  nevertheless  a place I am thankful for because the area doesn't have another store for  7 miles. Friendly and welcoming customer service.</review>

<Review>A very Friendly staff, but prices are taking advantage of the rural area, selection is not bad but could use some improvement. Customers are not allowed to use the restroom  under any circumstances. Also I found that 4/4 times I put gas from here in my new truck the engine light turns on and the fuel injectors get grimy. Overall the friendly staff is appreciated they're not enough to divert an average person from the downsides. I'd only reccomend it to someone who cant make it to the liquor store in lake Los Angeles,  until they improve on the fixable flaws.</Review>< pictures>

Great place in the middle of no where.  We were running out of gas and stumbled on this place that have gas yes I was forced to stop because my caddie was ran out of gas and I still had another 45 minute drive. & kids had to have a potty break. El Mirage saved me from having an anxiety attack...Thanks Gentlemen for being in the middle of nowhere.💙<//review>

The #9 Hot Pastrami is one of my favorite sandwiches on the menu.

The restaurant is very clean and the staff was super friendly.<//Review>

If you haven't tried the #9, what are you waiting for.  C'mon man!
I've been to the original Togo's on 336 E Williams St, San Jose, CA.  Sadly they had to close that location many moons ago but lucky for you and I, there are other locations all over to get our Pastrami, Turkey/avocado, etc. fix.
Hit 'em up and you will become a believer.< /review>

Good food, tasty subs sold here. I like their  sandwiches better than subway. The staff is very friendly and the convenience of pairing with Baskin-Robbins in the same shop is a pleasant bonus. 😊🥪🥗🍨🥤</Review>

It has been a long while since I have eaten at a Togo's.  Unfortunately it will be a long while before I go again.  Upon arrival there was another group sitting down eating their sandwiches.  There was no staff at the counter.  I waited a few minutes until I called out for an employee to assist me.  After three attempts, a seemingly preoccupied young lady came out from the backroom to take my order.  Being  unfamiliar with the menu and asking what my choices were as the sandwich was being made, the preoccupied server became almost surly in her attitude towards me.
For a large sandwich and a medium drink my total was $14. Overpriced in my opinion, the quality of the food was no better than a Subway sandwich.
As I only visit a Togo's eatery thrice a decade, I think I will stop altogether purely based on selection of ingredients, quality and price.  Any employee can have a bad day, but Togo's is not the experience I was looking for.<//text>

<Review>I saw this place as a must try on the news recently so since it's close by, let's go! The inside is definitely super small, it's meant to take out, but you have the option of eating next door at lucky 13. The burgers are delicious and so are the fries! Will for sure come again and try other things on the menu

We stop in every time when we are headed to the Angels game.  Tonight we decided since it was so hot out we would get some cool sandwiches.  Kevin was training his son tonight making sandwiches.  My sons(Mac and Mason)went to grade school with his son.  Kevin walked up and offered us a free sandwich of one that He and his son made.  We gladly accepted.  They have the best sandwiches in Corona by far.

Thanks again Chuck Mac and mason....< /Text>< pics>

Just like at home....I grew up in Togos home town San Jose and chose this Corona Location because its closest to me. Well worth the drive Riverside to Corona, the food hasn't changed at all still better then Subway Sandwiches and reminds me of my home area in San Jose.<//text>

<review>Just walked in and ordered a managers special for $8.79, which was a sandwich and a drink. The lady that made my sandwich charged me $10.99. I paid with a $20. Normally I dont look at my receipt. Good thing I did!! She acted like it was no big deal. Make sure you look at your receipt from this Togos on Ontario in Corona, so you dont get overcharged!!</review>< Pictures>

<review>Togos is a place if you love sandwiches you will love this place. They make the sandwiches to your personal preference.  Club, turkey, chicken,  meatball...they have an assortment.  Great place for lunch! Togos prpared sandwiches for a birthday party and were willing to deliver. Everyone enjoyed the sandwiches very much! Totally professional.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1527195109065, 'text': 'Marsha Johnson-Sellarole Thank you for visiting our locations! come again  🙏'}</Response>< gmap_id>

<review>Hubby and I ate here around 3:30 on a Friday. We were seated immediately. All tables and bathrooms were clean and servers wore masks (contrary to what a previous reviewer claimed.) All the indoors is beautifully remodeled if you remember Yorba Cantina, it is much nicer now!
Food took a little long getting out, but they're a new business so we gave them some grace. We ordered electric fries, electric tacos, fish tacos, and the beignets for dessert. My favorite by far was the fish tacos. They had large chucks of cod perfectly cTheir beer list was good and we enjoyed a fruity IPA "Juicy ??something" and their hef. Loved the hef! We will be back! It's very nice to have a nicer restaurant on this end of town.</review><username>Orn Congdon</username>< Gmap_id>

They have good food here, they have nice wait staff. I like what they're doing, it is nice to have it in your Yorba Linda East.  Fantasy Cafe needs to step it up to make this retail center an even bigger draw. Nice.< /review>

Came in for cocktail, Wow it would of been nice to have my glass filled....not half full. Absolutely No  Atmosphere at this place I've been several times everyone seems a bit Up-tight. The newness will fade and allow  us Locals will continue to go back to Kelly's, and Rembrandt. Enough said😇< /text>

The food is great,  yet they are under staffed each of the last 3 visits to the restaurant.  There are open tables,  yet a 30 minute wait on a Sunday morning at 10:30am.</Text>

<Review>Food is great , prices are too high and the staff service is bad . Also should not have to download a app to put in my reservation when I was standing in line to give the hostess my name. I would not recommend this place to anyone until they get there service  issues fixed .
...... Its a month or so since last review . The service has improved a lot , price still is to much for the amount and quality< /Review>< Pics>

Rather discouraging to sit and sit and sit and wait and then parties sneak in and seat themselves. Thinking management is lacking...
Probably will just call it a night and grab some food from Fantasy Cafe next door.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Favorite barbers anywhere, doesn't even matter who you get they're all good, clean, fast haircuts. Sports on the TV, old style barber chairs, sometimes I experiment with fades or styles and they always do a great job. Best in town!</review>

It's a good place and most of them can give you a decent haircut. But not the guy who usually stands next to the window.  He shaved all the way up to the cowlicks area and made it look like I had a bald spot when I asked for a mid fade.</review>

<Review>The barber shop workers are excellent. They are friendly and skilled.

However, it is expensive. A basic 15 minute fade haircut should not cost $25. Until prices drop to a fair cost, I can't rate this shop higher than 3 stars.<//Review>< Pictures>

I went in today for my first haircut at Magnolia Barber Shop. My hair was done by Chino. The attention to detail, care, and quality was perfect. I will never get my hair cut anywhere else in Santa Barbara. I am so glad I found this place after years of searching for a good place to get a trim. Consider me repeat customer from now on.< /review>

Travis in the chair farthest from the front door takes his time to perfect every cut. They don't take appointments, they only do walk-ins so the wait could be between 5 minutes to a few hours but it is definitely worth the wait. I suggest going earlier in the week.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Looks like a solid neighborhood barber with clean facilities and fair pricing. If you want that crispy fade you may want to explore other options.< /text>

Doesn’t matter if YOU didn’t decide to walk over to the barber immediately, and some other person did. So stop crying.</Review>< pics>

I don't recommend this place.  I walked in politely and said hi, they didn't even acknowledge me.  I waited 90 MINUTES (!) and they picked 3 people ahead of me - very rude.  Not professional and horrible experience before Christmas.<//Review>

I am glad God guided me to contact Omar. Truly a blessing to have come acrossed his listing. He answered my call just after a few rings and although his shop was about to close he willingly volunteered to come immediately to fix our clogged drain. He had replacement pipes which came handy and were not costly. He followed up and arrived in a timely manner. 100% satisfied and highly recommend his services.
Good vibes 😊
Honest and professional 👌
Definitely trustworthy.<//text>

I had them come out for a leak and they quickly found out it was not the pipes but a sink caulking problem.  They also fixed a low hot water pressure  problem. They were able find out it was a heater hose that was nearly plugged. They had initially tho it the had to do a copper re-pipe at the bathroom sink.  They solved the problem quickly. They are very honest. I will call them again.<//Text>

<review>When experiencing clogged plumbing call Omar’s plumbing. They are experts in their field with exceptional customer service, also reasonable pricing. I highly recommended if you’re in need of serves in the greater Los Angeles area.

Thank you guys for great work you do on my mom’s house this morning. My family and I appreciate the work you did in such short notice.

Thank you again,
from the Diaz and Robles family.</review></record>

Omar Plumbing just completed an extensive job at my home, had to replace entire gas lines due to old corroded pipes that caused multiple gas leaks. Omar and David are trustworthy, professional and reliable, very satisfied with the quality of their work which was completed within an exceptable time frame. I highly recommend their services.< /review>

I initially Called Omar's service for a bathroom shower leak. This turned into a bigger job than we anticipated due to water damage. Omar and David  were able to take care of the plumbing issues and recommended an excellent worker to do all the needed repairs. Everyone came on time and were very professional making sure I was satisfied with the work being done.<//review>

<Review>I've had a gas company shut off the pipe because of construction, but they couldn't re open it because of gas leaks. This was Friday night and I needed someone to fix it ASAP. Luckily I found Omar and they came out the next day and fixed the gas leaks on that day. They're nice and easy to work with. I highly recommend them.<//Review>< response>

<pics>None</pics><Text>Not a competent plumbing company, came to fix plumbing issue charged $200 and problem persist two days later. I called and asked them to come and fix the problem and they asked for more money. At this point I will call another company. Never again, don't use them. They do not guarantee their work, others give you 3 to 6 months, they 0 days. Omar stated he does not guarantee or give warranty for his work.< /Text>< rating>

They call you and hang up, they don’t let the phone ring so it makes it seem like you have a missed call. I was called back to back and didn’t get the chance to answer because they hang up. I can’t even call them back. And this is the 2nd day that my medication hasn’t been delivered. I would rather walk or drive somewhere to ensure that I get what I need. I would rather do extra work or extra traveling than use this service. And then they always answer the phone with an attitude. They are not considerate or sensitive of the ailments that they may come across through delivering for people. Terrible service. Poor communication.</review>

This is the type of Pharmacy that you get your prescription filled after someone has called it in such as Hospital or a Doctor's office only. They have high volume and the staff is very friendly and super busy. If you live in the neighborhood or your clinic is nearby this place is perfect. This is not a CVS or Walgreens. Shout out to Bella. She’s very professional and does a fantastic job among all the activity there. Unfortunately the floor manager seems like a very unpleasant person.<//Review>

<date>1614909599610</date><Text>Atrocious customer service. After they failed to deliver my prescription and recorded in their system that they had, I ran on my spare pill stash for weeks. I refilled an old lower-dose prescription at CVS to make up the difference while I tried to get it corrected. It took me another week of failed delivery to get someone on the phone to tell me “you waited too long.” What? I eventually got them to refill the rest of the prescription minus the CVS dosage, which obviously they could have done in the first place. Rude. Unhelpful. We’ll see if it actually shows up.< /Text>< GmapID>

<Rating>2< /Rating><review>I have been a quiet member of this Pharmacy, for so many years of 10+. I haven’t been able to meet any of them, only phone contact all these years ago. These are 1 negative and 2 positives, from the pharmacy taking advantage of my Medi-Medi and that is 1 of 2 positives. The number 2 is the delivery man “SERGIO”, that has been so cool and always professional and he clearly speaks and understands English, unlike most of you. When you all fail to deliver “1” medicine for my “treatment of my anxiety”, that’s a medicine I have been taking for years. I literally have to call them and all with the last one, I cannot even understand why.< /review>< Pictures>

I like Allen's, it takes several. Insurances including medical. They deliver or mail your refills and they do check their voicemail when you leave your information with refills needed. Thank you< /Review>

I've given Allen's pharmacy 5 chances before I'm calling it.   I work a lot and the delivery service is ideal and the only reason I chose them.  5 times they have made mistakes between charging my card but not setting a delivery, setting delivery but not showing etc.  I called in today to find out where my prescription is from 10:37am ( which the manager made a point of saying trying to prove me wrong because i said 10:30) and that deliveries start at 11 and it's my fault I missed it . Fine, although the previous guy said they forgot it.    I was told that they can't do anything about it, they hire drivers and that it's not their problem.  I asked for his guarantee that my next order would be properly handled and he said he can't give me that guarantee.  Somehow it's my fault and my problem by the time were done talking.  I'm done.   Poor customer service and poor understanding of customer relations.<//text>

<Review>I was condescended to and cut off mid sentence multiple times. After trying to calmly state why I didn't understand, the "Pharmacy manager" that was so awful this entire time said something I could not believe. In reference to my not understanding he said in a judgemental tone, "Is it because you are off your medication?" I them asked to speak to his supervisor or boss and he simply stated that he was it ("It's me..." ) and had no boss because "they're an independent pharmacy". I then asked for the owner's phone number and he repeated in a child like sing song tune "Nope! Nope! Nope, Nope!!" He claimes his name was Isaac W. My phone call took place around 9:15 am.</Review><Time>1532709574500</Time>< response>

Sometimes frustratingly slow, but always consistent. I am still peeved because of no "Imprime duo" on their answering machine, causing me to listen again in Spanish to what I just heard in English. This wouldn't be so bad except for the nature of the language, which takes about three times longer than to say its English equivalent.< /Text>

<review>Normally I would be giving Allen's a good review. Whenever the other pharmacies can't help me they can. This time however it was a different story....I went in to get a glucose monitor that CVS wouldn't give me but the insurance said it was covered. I had my doctor resend it to Allen's. I was told that  they would give it to me because  CVS had already filled it (not true). The person helping me was so rude. When I told her my doctor sent them the prescription she said really loud "where is it"?  I reexplained that my doctor sent it to them. She said "Well we can't help you  CVS has already filled it".  She was very loud and not willing to help. I left very frustrated.</review>< response>

<Review>Allens takes care of my disabled son’s medications, and I have yet to deal with any other pharmacy or health care clinic that can match the effort they put out to make sure their patients have their meds. And they treat their patient population with real respect, which makes a real difference. You can’t fake that and I can’t thank them enough for helping my son, whose disability leaves him unable to pay anything at all - you’d never know he was treated any differently as I watch him interact at the counter and on the phone. Allens deserves whatever reimbursement they receive for helping the challenged group with mental illness downtown. They serve with alacrity and skill, and with the emotional wisdom to know that looking somebody in the eye, saying their name, and doing so with genuine regard is a humanizing thing to do. And they do it well.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Allen Pharmacy has been my pharmacy for the past four years.  They have always been prompt with mailing my prescriptions.  At one point, my meds were mailed to me on a regular basis without me even having to call in for a refill request.  My meds always arrived within a day from my call placed to have the meds sent out.  They are very attentive and informative.  I highly recommend this pharmacy for anyone looking for a reliable-trustworthy pharmacy.<//review>

< Review>
Had the 150 point inspection for a car I was buying in Palm Springs from out of state.  They worked it into their schedule that day and gave me a report later in the day.  The report was comprehensive and included exterior and interior inspection.  I had total confidence in the results and had the car transported to me out of state.  My local Toyota dealer is very good and this one matched my experience with my local dealer.  Good job!< /Review>

I had the pleasure of being helped by JERRY RUSHING. Really kind and honest salesmen. You don’t find these too often throughout the car industry anymore. He has been selling / leasing cars here for over 19 years. He also told me all about the area from what to eat, see and do. If you are looking to buy/lease a car make sure to ask for JERRY RUSHING. Thank you so much for your help! These are the type of employees that you must keep and reward. Honesty and kindness always sells! Thank you for all of your help again JERRY! You rock! Keep up the great work! You have a customer for life now!<//Review>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Would give them 0 stars if possible..... Have gone here for service on my Prius fo 5 + years... I have one more oil change left on the plan I purchased.. will look elsewhere afterwards.   and will inspect the vehicle before I leave.  The service at the check in desks are mostly pleasant.   What happens in the garage another story.  Went for oil change...tire rotation and multipoint inspection.  I was give the GREEN check mark on all the following when in fact there were issues with all.
Windshield wipers---  rubber was torn and flapping ..yet I got a green mark

All fluids.....all were at the low level...I was given a Green check ..no
one topped them off as promised in the agreement  see photos...

After the 2 hour wait for an oil change my car sat at work for 3 hours..
I came out to a completely flat tire....had to have the tire changed, take it in for repair....was told it was only that the air valve was not tightened.
Had I driven on the freeway this could have been dangerous.
In the past I have let some little things slide...but this time I'm not a happy camper and see no reason to return.  :(.     I don't think it takes all that much to do routine work.....management does not seem to care.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIVSe3fFD00sSY_HRUFYhwoyD_cHCPCmQySPO1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_TQrsHrNHBqtgPZaolaRGMXSYzOTXCvqi-Liu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

Wonderful fast service, Mike is the best always eager to help and give discounts when available!
If you are seasonal they will get you in quickly for an appointment & have you back on the road in no time 🚗 Prefer this location over Indio location. Much better assistance. Worth the extra driving time to get the utmost quality care.</text>

Juan was amazing very attentive and professional. In the years I’ve been coming I always receive great customer service but Juan exceeded all expectations by going over everything my car needs and my options. Very pleased with his work ethics. I will definitely ask for Juan going forward and will recommend him to my family and friend who also get their car maintenance there. Thank you again Juan for your time. Paulette.</review>

Everyone at Toyota of the Desert was just wonderful! Natalie, Drew, and Jeffrey were all fantastic and made the whole buying process seamless and painless. When it finally was time to come in for a test drive and sign, it really was just that simple!

Thank you all for making this purchase a pure joy! I couldn't be happier with the car or the deal I got.< /text>

My buying experience at Toyota Of The Desert could not have gone better. Vic Lopez & Victor Hernandez made the process painless and straightforward. I got a great car at a great price. If you are in the market for a new or used Toyota, make Toyota Of The Desert your first stop. You won't be disappointed.<//Text>

"Thank you so much, Mike, for going above and beyond this week in taking care of my car service and getting me in and out of there in time to make my doctors appointment."  Mike was professional and courteous and seemed to truly care that I needed to be at an afternoon appointment...he was honest in saying he couldn't guarantee a time for my car to be finished but would try his best.  He was able to get my car serviced in a very timely manner and had me on my way.  I can't say enough good things about this outstanding young man.  Thank you.<//review>

Update:
Is your idea of finding a solution to this issue is to have someone call and inform me that you “somehow” have my plates now and will be same day sending them to an incorrect address? I informed the person of the address error and she said that it will be sent to the correct address and should arrive on Monday or Tuesday. Still no plates and when I call to find out what the issue is this time, I STILL GET THE SAME RUNAROUND. How about instead of offering to correct a service you obviously have ZERO intention of providing, you refund me my money so I can do it myself???

Dealing with this company has been one of the most frustrating experiences I’ve ever had. I bought out my lease August 2020 and have spent the last 8 months being largely ignored by their staff. I have places 37 phone calls to various people, from the very friendly and helpful receptionists all the way up to the GM (who hasn’t answered or responded to any messages). All I want is to find out why my license plates have not arrived. After 8 months, I still have NO ANSWER AND NO RESPONSES!!!
I’d strongly caution purchasing a vehicle from here if you have any thought of possible service help afterwards.< /text>

<Review>I would not recommend going to this dealership. They called us after signing papers that we had to switch to their bank because we didn’t get approved and that we had to sign again. We came to finance and we waited 3 hours and they took everyone before us. Horrible customer service for paying 70,000 for a Toyota Supra! We came back the next day, we told them what’s in it for us for switching to your bank and they said because we didn’t get approved . We told them we wanted our money back since we had to sign again and they immediately said the deal is done with your bank. I would definitely not come back for a car , I would take my money to Toyota I10<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1615840326390, 'text': 'Hello Veronica Renteria,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave a review for our dealership.

Juan Diaz gave us exceptionally professional, courteous and friendly service throughout a 2-day process of repairs we had been delaying or ignoring for several years.  Kept us posted on progress throughout, and I never felt like I was being pressured into repairs I didn't need. And what repairs! Feels like a new car, and it's 10 years old!<//text>

Nate, thanks for being an outstanding salesman. Your transparency is what gave me the confidence to make a deal with TOTD. You made sure that you listened to my needs first and that’s important in your line of work. Also thanks for going the extra mile, I greatly appreciate it. One more thing, shoutout to Steve in financing for some great conversation! 5/5 all day at Toyota of the Desert.
Sincerely, Ché Chang

I went into Toyota of the Desert for regular scheduled brake service. Always Great Customer Service from beginning to end. Took the time to check out the info on my current lease while I was waiting. The Sales help was very helpful in explaining my options. Never “Pushy”. When I’m ready to renew a Lease or buy I’ll be back!< /text>

Definitely the place to go if you want a car ! I went to another dealership in LA and it was absolutely horrific. They say that I was young and tried to scam me and put me in debt. Charlie at the Toyota of the Desert helped me get a great car with a low interest rate, 2021 car, and great monthly payments. Ask for him ! He is definitely a very great salesman :)</Text>

As a first time car buyer with absolutely no idea about anything car related, I can say with confidence that I am SO glad I chose Toyota of the Desert. From the beginning to the end of my car buying process, I was treated with kindness and respect. Sean contacted me straight away and talked me through the entire process every step of the way and went out of his way to make sure I was comfortable and understood everything. I had so much anxiety about buying my first car but Sean was so great that I couldn't have wished for any other person to help me. I couldn't come to the dealership so Sean and staff got all my paperwork and information ready before bringing my car to me! Honestly so grateful for this because it saved me so much time and hassle having to wait at the dealership for hours. I'm extremely happy with the car I chose (2013 Prius C) and with the deal itself. Reasonable pricing- no gauging whatsoever. And let me just say that the cleanliness and condition of this car is unlike anything I expected; The car looks nearly brand new!!?! Not to mention Sean was so nice over the phone and in person and extremely knowledgeable which helped so much. Overall just an awesome person and worker. He went above and beyond for me and i'm sooo thankful!! As long as i'm in the desert I won't go anywhere else for my car needs. Thanks again to the staff at Toyota of the Desert for being so awesome, and especially Sean. He's a real one.</Review>

Took my wife's car in this last weekend (4/10) for a simple service only to be made to wait 2 hours while people who showed up for the same thing after me were being sent off in 45 mins or less. They fixed this problem by giving me a free service next time which was a kind gesture but on my drive home I noticed my car's service light was still on which made me feel they didn't even service my car, so I gave them a call back not even 5 minutes after leaving the service center. I called the service department only to get transferred to the operator 3 different times until finally she was able to find out that ALL of the service agents took their lunch at the SAME time, makes sense right? The operator then jot down my information and told me that someone would give me a call back as soon as their lunch was over. Waited all day only to have no one call me back. I was then forced to call back on Sunday and have the same kind operator try and find someone for me to talk to which was a different manager and tell me "you'll just have to call back tomorrow that isn't my department." I finally called back today (4/12)  to explain the situation and find out they did service my car but just forgot to reset my light and they were going to have me go in again but im glad I asked if there was a way to reset it myself because I feel like this place just enjoys wasting people's valuable time. The girl who was helping me through the process of it was kind at first but then got irritated with me because of my bad signal instead of having patience for me. Its so ironic that when they put you on hold you get a little pre-recorded voice over talking about how they pride themselves in service yet I got everything but that this weekend. They didn't even bother to top any of the fluids off either. I wouldn't recommend this service center to anyone reading this.<//Text>

Update: The manager at the dealership reached out to me and we are in the process of resolving this issue.

I purchased a Yaris at Toyota of the Desert in December 2020. At the time I bought a platinum protection plan for $1595. When I called the company to use the plan I was informed the dealership had sent an email the day of purchase canceling the plan. I was not notified of the cancelation and no refund/credit has been issued.  It seems very shady and I'm still waiting for my money to be refunded. I will never buy a car from them again given such poor business practices and encourage others not to either.<//Review>

They successfully copied our key fob, which was the service we requested. They then did a complementary inspection, which we did not request, and informed us that the rack and pinion needed replacement, a shocking $1500 repair.

To confirm, I had the car looked at by someone else, and he said there was no such issue. This corresponds with the opinion of the mechanic who had looked at the car just a month or so before we took it to Toyota of the Desert. I'm not sure if they just made a bad guess or were intentionally making up an issue that did not exist; either way, it makes me not want to return to this business for servicing.

I'm giving them two stars for the baseline service we requested, but others should be wary of whatever extra repairs are recommended from their "free" inspection.</Text>

<Text>Visually entertaining and appealing with a wishing well in the middle of the building
Usually very accommodating and helpful.
However like most dealerships they tried offering a very low amount compared to the actual value of the vehicle we were trying to trade in.

Maintenance wise they dont seem to be focused on customer service  but give off a more so, how much can I get this person to pay for repairs they dont need kind of vibe.

Overall though the cars they sell are presented nicely and the salesmen do try to get the customer to a vehicle that they would like while also making sure the customer has refreshments. The receptionist however was very unhelpful and refused to lookup the sales record for the vehicle perchanced from them. Nor would she ask for assistance from someone else.< /Text><Time>1619298021305</Time><Resp>{'time': 1619463984868, 'text': 'Hello John Molley,\n\nThank you for your feedback.

Well well well.. where do I start 🤔? I saw a vehicle online that caught my fancy, made my way down to the dealership and guess what .. just guess....It was m.i.a. So I test drove a newer version,but it wasn't calling me. the person who was brave enough to ride with me 😉 took the time to find out what happened the vehicle and that was nice. Fast forward next day I received my car lol well the point of my rant. If you're thinking about buying a vehicle go  to Toyota Of The Desert they're great 😅.  Everyone is awesome they're not just out for commission, they really do take the time to help you and work to put you in what you're looking for.  You have my word on it  I don't like everyone or place😁😆😁🤪. But This place is five stars I don't know why I gave three. 🤔 I must have been mad just purchased and in 2 weeks my brakes squill in reverse wonder why... Enjoying my purchase</Text>

Super seamless and easy experience at Toyota of the Desert, thanks to Ivan! I dropped my Lexus off for a 30,000 mile maintenance. (It’s cheaper to do so at Toyota, than Lexus) Everything worked out great!</Review>

He quickly provided us videos of the cars we were interested in and also made the effort to provide us the most realistic and optimal pricing estimates. He went above and beyond with his communication as well as streamlined the buying process. Big shout out to his extremely supportive manager who made our deal work effortlessly. Also a big thank you to our Finance guy Kacy who got us in and out with us smiling and signing...

Andrew and Oscar were amazing. They made my car buying experience simple and enjoyable. I started at the Honda of the Desert, but wasn’t sold, and didn't feel listened to. As soon as I walked over to Toyota I could feel the difference in the atmosphere. Oscar was the first person I talked to at Toyota and we figured out what car I wanted to test drive. He was in the middle of another sale and got called away. That’s when Andrew stepped in. Andrew was awesome. I knew right away that it was going to be a great experience. Andrew was not immediately trying to sell me on something. He listened to my needs and wants in the car, and helped secure an amazing deal for me with the finance department that was better than the prequalifying deal I came in with. He was kind, and not pushy ensuring that I was walking away satisfied with my new car. I couldn’t be happier with my experience at Toyota of the Desert.</Text>

I was very satisfied with the service on my car repair. My advisor, Alissa Dinnoo, was very helpful and easy to work with. My prior visit this year was also very positive. At this time my repair was made and I was not pressured in any way. I was also given the huge courtesy of a ride home and a ride back which was a really big help to me. I will be returning to them for additional work. Would definitely recommend taking your vehicle here.<//Text>

Kacy Reneau in finance was able to have the documents done prior to delivery. Both Drew and Kacy both knowledgeable and helpful with our car. Most pleasure we’ve had in buying a car. No high pressure on any part of the sale. What they quoted us was what we paid. Other Toyota dealers said that’s impossible but Toyota of the Desert stood by their quote. Will buy another Toyota from them in the near future. Even an hour and half drive to get our vehicle was worth it!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>We had a great experience in purchasing a certified pre owned vehicle.  Please note I place dealers at the same level as going to a dentist.  We found our low mileage Venza on truecar.  It was a great deal according to truecar. After a phone mixup issue, we finally connected.  Given that we live 1.5 hours, I needed what the price would be since truecar prices do not always match once you a dealership. They gave us the price as advertised and we made the trip. We are very happy with vehicle and we bought it.  The staff at all levels were very helpful.  More importantly, the explained everything and made no effort to upsell us though we asked about prices for extended warranty, maintenance, and GAP insurance.  In our discussion, they gave us a fair price on the everything, which we wanted, and explained why we did not need GAP.  We asked about Trade in of our Prius, which came in much lower than the blue book value, which they told us as well.  So we kept the Prius rather than trading it in.  The bottom line is that felt they were very honest and straight forward with us.  Of course, they were also very friendly.    They were worth the trip out there!<//review>< gmapID>

Anthony was AWESOME! My mom and I were looking to purchase cash for a 2020 Camery. After being greeted by a sales man that was “non customer friendly”... I was ready to leave and spend our money elsewhere.
Anthony was INCREDIBLE!!!!...... This was the easiest car purchase EVER.
Thank you Anthony!!!!  You are the TRUE STAR OF THE DESERT!!!<//Review>

Nobody wants to be without their van around the holidays, but my recall needed to fixed. The service writers arranged for curbside service. I didn't have to leave my house, take an Uber, or find a ride there and back. Thank you for fixing my recall and making sure I wasn't inconvenienced. We will be back with our Tundra next week.</Text>

<rating>4</rating><review>Recieved a notice about a recall on my car and a certain date that I needed to bring it for service before I had to pay out of pocket? I was trying to get an answer about that. When I scheduled the appointment and got to the dealership I was told one part to my car was delayed. One of the service reps, who scheduled me the appointment failed to let me know that. I was a little disappointed when I had to drive to the dealership and get sent away because that lack of communication. I was told someone was going to call me regarding when the second part came in and of course that never happened. I called to ask if, first, the part came in and regarding the notice. No one knew.  I was redirected to bring in my car for a inspection and parts to be reordered?? I was little confused in the first place why parts were being ordered and delayed if they had to inspect the car in the first place? That definitely felt like I was given the run around. I was assigned to Mike Flores. At the end he was able to have someone fix my car and told me that the recall should be free of charge.  Overall the service was a little flip floppy. I do have to give credit to the ones actually fixing my car due to the heat. Thank you for that</review><pics>None<//pics></record>

I called the next day to explain what happened and when can I have the result of the inspection. So it starts hear. I told him that I was willing to buy all four new tires but I needed to if it was safe to drive home after the inspection. After 8 hours I payed for 4 new tires and i asked him if it was safe to drive home with the wheel well hanging like it was and he said the it was fine. Also one new tire looked like it was low on air. Found out that it was. Finally we left the dealer got on the highway and guess what happened next. The wheel well cam off on the the highway causing me to remove everything he said would be fine.< /Text>< Pics>

The part department seem to think they don't work in customer service. Always moody and rude, every time I forget why I prefer going to an online factory store, all I have to do is call Toyota of the Desert and I quickly remember why online is so much better. Its not like factory parts are cheap and I guess its my mistake for expecting to speak with a professional. My family has purchased 3 vehicles from here and the sales team is awesome, the parts department has a long way to go. Not worth your time or money.<//review>

Toyota of Desert in Cathedral City always have a great  professionalism in serving their client. I always have the best experience from buying a car, trading in and during car service maintenance, people are very knowledgeable and served you in a very ethical manner. I always refer them with my friends when buying a car especially Mr Jerry Rushing. Thank you Toyota of the Desert.< /Text>

<text>This dealership is was a pleasure to visit. The staff who work there are friendly but never pushy. I bought my RAV4 from sales representative, Jerry Rushing. Jerry was very accommodating and easy to work with as was Steven in the finance department. If you are looking for a Toyota then you won't go wrong purchasing or leasing one from here!<//text>< resp>

<text>I visited Toyota of the Desert on a couple of occasions when I was searching for a truck. I ultimately ended up buying a Ford from the Ford dealership, but that was due to personal preferences with the vehicles themselves. The staff of Toyota of the Desert was nothing but professional and friendly. The salesman I worked with, Ace, was understanding, knowledgeable, and never pressured me to do or buy anything. He followed up with me via phone call at the times that I requested, even if it was a month or two apart. Overall, I had a phenomenal experience with Toyota of the Desert and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a vehicle!<//text>< user>

BE CAREFUL!! When staff stands you up for an appointment they refuse to provide the General Manager's name and contact info. NO ACCOUNTABILITY - except a negative review. I-10 Toyota in Indio is much easier to work with.< /review>

I was recently there due to recalls but ended up buying the full service package they had because my car was due for an oil change anyway, I thought ok great everything’s going to be fixed and great. They ended up “fixing” the recalls but now I turn the wheel and it makes noise, my passenger seat has a stain of oil, the mechanics left either a mask or hair bags in car plus light bulbs and everything from my glove compartment was taken out and just on my seat and now my side mirrors can’t be adjusted. And I still have to go back because they didn’t make sure they had all recall parts in. Very disappointed!< /text>

Tanner,Andrew, and Maria at the Toyota dealership were extremely helpful and I would recommend my friends and family to this dealership . They were able to finalize both transactions , giving us a great financing option on our 4runner while also giving us above market value for our used Mazda . Thanks guys! Made the whole transaction very painless and easy</Review>< Pics>

<Rating>4</Rating><text>I have somewhat been hesitant with going to car dealers for service as a stigma from other reviews I’ve seen about overcharging or trying to get you to spend more than what you really need, but after this last visit, I must say, that I plan on continuing with my business and use of services here for as long as I have my Toyota. After my car purchase two years ago and end of complimentary service with Toyota Care, I’ve had to go back for service a few times before this visit for light maintenance, but looked elsewhere for costly services such as tires for fear of being overcharged. I also always come in and plan on waiting for service for a minimum of 2 hours, especially with how busy they are daily, so I make sure to pack a book or charged phone! I completely understand that this can take longer nowadays since they have to have all of the cleaning procedure to Covid-19, so I was especially thankful that my wait this time to get an appointment the same day, as well as wait time, were much quicker than expected! Marlena is the gal who always seems to be “stuck” helping me whenever I get my service and I thank her for putting up with my questions and concerns! She was even so amazing enough to notify me of some possible faulty service done elsewhere or even attempted robbery of my tires as one of the lugs seemed to be loose. She let me know that she made sure they would take care of it for me for my and others’ safety on the road and has just been an absolute delight for providing amazing assistance and care whenever I pay them a visit! She even recommends the best money saving options for me, as I drive a lot for work and require maintenance of my vehicle every couple of months or so, which can definitely add up! I definitely plan on looking at their other services for future needs for my car, besides just the light maintenance moving forward! Hopefully, one day, when we go past these scary times of uncertainty, the wait times will decrease!<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>Sean Cunningham was the best person to go to if you’re looking for a Toyota! He is very knowledgeable and very friendly. He also is very very engaged in the customers not just the sale of the car. He definitely makes sure you’re happy before you leave that lot! This was also my first car and he helped me get an awesome deal for my 2020 Toyota Camry! I never knew how easy it was to get a car.. thank you so much Sean! Now I have to get busy working 😉!

The work was done on a timely manner. Plenty of space to sit apart plus coffee and water to drink. Hand sanitizers are place all around the area.</review>

I have brought every vehicle that I own to Tire 4 Less with the team. Last week, the Toyota dealership told me I needed to replace a tire on my 4Runner for a nail. I brought it & it was fixed in less than two hours for a fraction of the cost. They are honest, trustworthy, and kind - everything you could ask for.<//Review>

< review>
Update: Last month I took my hybrid in for regular service PLUS the hot weather check up. I'm glad I did. With summer only weeks away, I'm glad my a/c, brakes, and filters are all in tip-top shape!  -- With a hybrid, I only trust my Toyota dealer to perform the service. My recent experience two days ago was perfect. The shop opened at 7am on the dot. The in-take was prompt and professional. Jose did a great job keeping me informed and handling the check out process. I drove away with the peace of mind that my Rav4 will be going strong for another 5K miles. (Toyota of the Desert upholds best practices for the protection of everyone including masks and many hand sanitizer dispensers. The waiting room furniture has been spaced out for social distancing. All efforts sensible and much appreciated.)< /review>

<Name>MVDuds13< /Name><time>1603489532681< /time><rating>2<//rating><Review>Update - Took car in again Sept(2-Stars):
After a couple pleasant experiences and posting a 5-Star review, I am taking the review down a few clicks based on the last experience.
Took Moms car in again due to rattling-knocking underneath, prob with support. Was told there was a laundry list of things to fix on the car, for a total of $4,158 (lowered to $3,950 when I said we’d think it over and review the quote).
* Of course we paid the $150 diagnostic fee to have it looked at and that will apply to service if we decide to have it fixed there.

It’s been a few weeks now, and we still haven’t received an emailed breakdown for the quote promised. Was shown part costs, but not labor. Without knowing how much each specific job is in total separately, especially the one that we brought the car in for, then we are unable to make a decision on whether to fix (2006 Matrix is 15 yrs old) and if so, in what order.
This experience, has opened the door back up to getting the car fixed locally where we live.
We will see how this plays out...
*positives of friendly service and them providing ride share to golf course is why I gave it 2-Stars.
If we get completion on this job, I am still open to raising the review.

This round of service is disappointing!

Original Review in August (5-Stars):
I have avoided Dealerships for decades because of exuberant charges & a couple misleadings I’ve seen.

That being said, I had to take my Moms car in for Recall Work.
I was pleasantly surprised with them wearing masks and putting easy remove tape on door handles to protect against virus spread.👌🏽
*** This is a huge factor. There are local places where we are, an hour away, but I haven’t seen much Covid protection during the repair process.

So, for Recall, the passenger side airbag was replaced free of charge, as stated. While the car was there, I had them fix an issue with windshield wiper fluid not making its way to the windshield. It was a problem with the lines, that were hidden, and it was fixed the same day as the recall work. Everyone I talked to on the phone was very friendly and helpful getting info👍🏽 And Ivan, that I worked with specifically, was fantastic! His attention to detail, friendliness, and professionalism were  much appreciated.

Since this experience was so easy and pleasant, as well as reasonable on the price end… I recently took her car in for another repair item. Once again, everyone on the phones and Ivan who helped me specifically again was on point.

Because of these last two experiences, we have something else on the radar for this dealership when the time comes. So far, so good...

*** Sidenote, since the car was left for a half-day once and a full day the first time… I would recommend getting some golf in at one of the local courses while they do the work if you’re into that.
Since I drove about an hour from Joshua tree to get this work done, it was a great way to pass the time.

Again, we will use them in the future.</Review>< pictures>

I had a great first time car buying experience at Toyota of the Desert. From starting off inquiring on a vehicle online, Drew was a wonderful help and I felt like I was in great hands. Testing driving was awesome and Crystal took great care of myself and the process of paperwork. Anthony and Sandi also helped me seal the deal and I was off in my new 2019 Toyota C-HR. I am now a very proud owner of my new Toyota. If ever needed thanks to Drew I know I can count on him and his kindness! Thank you all😁<//Text>

<userid>118039470499339181335< /userid><review>Remarkable! I have a 2002 Toyota Rav4 that hadn’t been serviced at T.O.T.D. since 2015. My car couldn’t pass a Catalyst Monitor check for a Star certified Smog Check. After driving around as suggested by others, and failing tests still,, I brought it to Toyota. Not only did they fix the problem (I passed today in about 1 minute) but they restored a cracked sunroof, a bad window motor and several other pending issues not related to my initial issue. I owe this incredible service to Service rep Alissa. First, she was attentive and kind, and in these days, practiced appropriate Social distancing as required. Then she was more than happy to search for parts that were nearly 20 years old. From the moment I entered until the time I received my car back, Alissa communicated with me 100% of the time with courtesy and enthusiasm so rarely seen. Thank you all at Toyota of the Desert, and thanks to your brilliant service department my 2002 Rav4 is working better than ever before. I will definately return in the future!<//review>< gmap_id>

I went in early May of 2020 to check out a used RAV4 on the lot, and was greeted by Jerry Rushing. He was attentive and very knowledgeable, made a personal connection with me and my family, was fun to work with, and made my visit to the dealership easy and enjoyable. He is a credit to his team and his company. If you’re in the market, I highly suggest seeing Jerry first!< /Text>

<Review>Our wait while getting our car an oil change was over 3 hours long... at the end we found our that the car had been done for over an hour and we were just waiting for our attendant to complete the paperwork. Later we found out that her computer had frozen so maybe she was just having a hard day... And in the end, we got $20 off of our service fee. So, all in all, at least we got a discount for the long wait - but, if you come here, expect to wait a while.</Review>< Pics>

<text>This is the filthiest child area I've ever seen. Only one block toy in the center of the nastiest playmat for kids to play with. It has a chalkboard that hasn't been cleaned with no chalk to play with. The two benches are nasty. Horrible place for a mom and kids to wait but this is the closest Toyota for us and we are an hour and a half away. Not only that.. we've been waiting for over two hours just for an oil change. We had an A/C check also scheduled and they completely forgot so now we have to wait another two hours.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXNh6AX4HmGH9zT3npYLuzn745oQwsdSQSgIrL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAPGNyAZ5HS-JxjtQfcfCeCzAQxKZ0kJTkJ6L9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>{'time': 1506547302834, 'text': 'Katrina, we’re sorry that our child area was in such a bad condition when you came for service.

<user_name>John Norton<//user_name><Pics>None</Pics><text>Really sad to have had such an experience with this Toyota dealership. Took in my mom's car for a recall service. Was immediately introduced to an unwelcoming tone from service attendent Sylvia. When the car was ready, I again was brought to a very short and dissapointing conversation by Sylvia. When I got in my car, I noticed all of my mom's change was gone from both the cup holders and center box. Really? I can expect this from a mechanic shop, but from a dealer? It's just change, but it shows the integrity of the service workers. I'll think twice about using this location and recommending it to anyone.< /text></record>

Service was disorganized.  Parts person not wearing a mask.  Ladies rest room not clean.  No hand sanitizer at check in desks.  Service took an hour longer than promised.  When I went to inquire, they said car was done, but they couldn't find it on the lot!  Service Manager texted after service to follow up  I texted back to ask him to call so that I could provide feedback, but he never called.  And, lastly, mechanics did not turn off the "Service Due" notice on my dash.  NEVER RETURNING .. and I would not purchase a Toyota because of this service.<//Text>

Decent service while trying to buy that car but absolutely no service after the purchase.  Calls go unanswered and no one returns calls.  Once they have your money you don't exist to them.<//Text>

Service department is an absolute joke, Kylie is absolutely terrible at customer service. Paid $$$$ for service and only had half the job done, when they were hours late on service after it was promised. Go to I-10 if you're in the Palm Springs area and need something done by the dealership.</Text>

<rating>5</rating><text>I purchased my 2019 RAV4 from Toyota of the dessert which is approximately 6hrs away from me, without ever meeting Ed & John or visiting your dealership, & without personally inspecting the Rav4. This was completely out of character for me. My purchase was made possible because of your knowledge, professionalism, service you provided me; your integrity; & your kindness.The car arrived the very next day after we talked, for which I thank you. This was a very quick response.
Customer loyalty & trust mean a lot to me.  I will be letting friends & family know of my great experience & they also can experience the same in their purchases of cars from you in the future. Thank you again for all your help & hope to visit soon & meet everyone!<//text>< pictures>

<Time>1505351991646</Time><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Let me just start off by saying how I really do not enjoy going into a ANY kind of dealership. I had a 2015 Toyota Prius. I decided to bring it in because I wanted to see what kind of deal they had. I honestly went in there not even thinking I was going to buy another car. I did however have my eye on the Red 2017 plug-in Toyota Prius Prime- Premium ( which is the mid model) once I was looking around the lot. Sean Cunningham approached us while we were looking at cars and I thought to myself "oh here we go". It's not any strike against him. I'm just not really big on sales people. His approach was awesome. He was talking to me like a bro instead of those car people that linger over you.

I will have to say that Sean Cunningham ( our salesman ) who sold us this car and also the finance manager that helped us with our back and forth sales figures,  really were AWESOME. I admit I was quite standoffish mainly because I'm really not fan of this entire process.

After ALOT back-and-forth between whether I should get the Prius prime or the regular Prius,  I finally decided on getting the The Red 2017 Plug-In Prius Prime. I am so glad that I decided to pay a little extra to get the car that I really wanted. This car is absolutely insane ( in a good way) The plush leather interior, The 11.5 inch monster display. The fact that it has amazing gas mileage is a huge asset for me because I drive a lot. 25 miles on a single charge on EV mode (without touching the gasoline) once the PLUG IN battery is depleted, the gas/electric engine kicks in. 58 MPG I'm getting on Hybrid mode.

It has an AC button on the keyless key module that you press and hold it. It starts the AC up ( not the circulating fans) The AC before you get in the car?? Whaaaat?? How AWSOME!! And so needed since we live in the desert.

I really appreciate their patience with my indecisiveness. They made the sale go really smooth. I was quite nervous and they just help me through every step of the way. I drove this bad boy off the lot, and haven't looked back. Thank you Toyota of the Desert! David Gregory and Alan McMahon

PS. Take my advice! If you are thinking about getting another car, time to hit Toyota of the Desert.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Had a service done (recall..system upgrade)  during end of the week..When I got home I noticed that my front license plate cover was switched out. I called the service manager Robert. When he called me back he was very friendly and understanding☺. He told me to come in and get a replacement cover. When I arrived on Monday, he was at the front counter reception area, he had me pick out new license plate covers for my car😀. He went up and above..and I really appreciated him doing that, it made my day. Bart the gentleman outside in the service area put them on for me, He was very nice and helpful..Thank you so much😀..As I was leaving another gentlemen, walks up by the name of Ed..he had the best personality ever..he is a shining star⭐..Sending a special Thank you to all 3 gentleman for making my experience truly special..👍😀<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80db032c208d8adf:0x26f09ca597bf8d0d</gmap_id></record>

Great service, had a quick minor issue with a gas door and service writer Ivan Alvarado, though very busy came out to have a look and help fix the issue without the need to send it through the service department as it only needed a $10 part. I bought the part from Parts Dept and Service Writer took care of installation right there in service drive. Quick, Kind and gracious. Appreciate the help on a very busy holiday weekend.<//review>

Very frustrated that I scheduled an online appointment for routine service for 1:00pm  pick up today.  Per the online scheduling it said within a 15 mile distance, I entered my work address and it confirmed.  Now 45 minutes before the scheduled time I called them to see how I can get my keys to them when they arrive... and instead they told me I am too far away and they can't come here and would've cancelled 30 minutes out.  What the heck?<//review>

The last two times my car has needed service I have gone to Toyota of the Desert.  My first time I dealt with Fred who was great.  This last weekend I dealt with Ricky who was great as well.  I expected to have to wait for about an hour and a half but was done early.  I appreciated Ricky’s follow up and follow thru.
Thanks again.<//Text>

I was not shopping at Toyota of the desert but was next door at the sister dealership Honda of the Desert. Both are owned by the same company and both are very clean nice sitting areas drinks popcorn available for those waiting. It seemed to be a good operation but I didn't do any business there.<//Review>

I am very disappointed at this Toyota dealership. I had purchased a car but wasn’t able to receive it that day because they had to get it from another dealership. I was willing to wait one day for it. But on the day I was suppose to pick up my new car, I received a phone call. They told me the car I wanted wasn’t available anymore but they had another car in the same color. Only this car didn’t have the same features as the car I had purchased. I told them I wanted the same features of the car I had purchased but they told me they weren’t able to find one for me. They waited the next day to tell me they weren't going to find a car like the one I had purchased. So, I had asked to cancel my agreement and for them to send me back my down payment. It’s been 3 days now and I still haven’t received my down payment.

If I could give zero stars I would.<//text>

I like this place.  I was treated well when i made a purchase there years ago,  and the service department did good work on my brakes.    My latest Toyota was purchased elsewhere, but only because they didn't have the car i wanted....I still take it to them for service.   A friend also raves about their service department... so a positive recommendation for that shop.< /Review>

Everybody has always been friendly here but we had a deal on a vehicle only to find out the vehicle was already sold while we were making the deal. Months later after having our eventual purchase serviced multiple times there's always some issue and something always goes as not described or promised. Everyone is always friendly but nothing but headaches with this place.< /Text>

I purchased a used certified 2017 RAV 4 in Aug 2018. It looked and ran well. That summer a friend noticed that my back-up light did not light when I was backing-up. I went to the dealership and asked them to look into it. I started this in May 2018. Today, Feb. 5, 2020 the problem was resolved. Over a year and a half I have called repeatedly about getting the part and getting the light repaired. I spoke with Johnny Pipitt in person on 10/26/19, a weekend sharing my frustration with this issue as I had left repeated messages on Ricky Doremus' and Ivan Alvarodo's voice mails. My calls were not returned. I went in yesterday about this again, the part was ordered, installed and I was charged about half of what the charges were. The damage was from the previous owner,  I had no knowledge of it, but I could not prove it. So it was not covered in the certified agreement. Here is my point: Be careful and have any certified used vehicle you buy from this dealership inspected by a trusted outside mechanic.
This RAV 4 was the 3 vehicle I have purchased at this dealership. I will not be going back.< /text>

I bought a new car here, and had never been here before. They had the exact car I wanted, out and ready to be driven, before I was even there. I got a LOT of extra maintenance put on for a good price. I was in and out in less than four hours!! This was a fast, easy, great experience, and I would certainly recommend them! I look forward to seeing their employees in the future! Super nice, honest, and caring!! :)<//review>

The man who helped us was very nice and kind, I don't remember his first name but I believe his last name was Rushling or Rushing!
He was friendly and super kind!!
BUT.....I did not appreciate this man by the name John Lennox he was helpful, but I believe he just took advantage of us being first time buyers.
He added these service agreements to our application which I had no idea were optional (or I woulda had them removed) till I got home. He didn't mention that. There was a total of 3 agreements for an additional $7,755,he sneakily slid in there and me being a first time buyer was not aware of them being optional.
Also he claimed to me that in the warranty service agreement that I will be able to get tires, wheels, and cosmetic damage fixed with no charge. When I get home I'm looking over the paper work and the warranty agreement he gave me EXCLUDES cosmetic damages and only has tires and wheels. This was not a good experience buying our first car from here, I feel taken advantage and being upcharged on things I wasn't aware of.<//Review>< resp>

I recently received a " Bonus Loyalty Offer " in the mail from general sales manager Johnny Pipitt of Toyota of the desert offering me 110% trade in value for my 2017 Tundra. I called and spoke with Johnny and he confirmed that he would honor the coupon. Upon arrival I found the truck I wanted to purchase, took it for a test Drive and was ready to make a deal. Unfortunately not only did Johnny Pipitt not want to honor his bonus loyalty offer but he raised the price from $36,000 MSRP to $39,000. Being a return customer That seems very suspicious to me. It's sad to think that's how Management in that dealership treats customer. If there's a store manager or store owner that can contact me about this I would love to talk to him or her...
((((Thank you anthony@kengarff.com for your kind words. I see you leave similar messages to other unhappy customers that leave your dealership negative feedback. Your employee Johnny Pipitt lied to me to get me in the doors, did not honor the Loyalty offer he personally told me he'll honor and raised the price on a $36000 MSRP truck, is that okay with you? Although I appreciate your time and Google response but please don't ignore this issue.. I've reached out to you, Johnny Pipitt has my #. )))<//text>

Went in last week with my boyfriend to shop for a truck.  We were treated with such great care by everyone we encountered. He found what he wanted and the entire process was taken care of with such ease.  Jerry, Gil, and Jeanette are such a great asset to this company they go above and beyond to make sure everything is explained right and that we left with smiles on our face. Thank you for making this a great experience! Free refreshments was greatly appreciated.</text>

I don't leave reviews.  But on Monday, October 28th, Sylvia Illman and her team of technicians went far beyond the routine great service I expect from Toyota of the Desert.  I had made a mistake and switched times for 2 appointments.  Sylvia, whom I have found delightful to work with, got my vehicle in and serviced in time for me to get to the doctor.  She didn't have to rush and rearrange her technicians schedules for me, a late arriving customer, but she did with her usual humor, efficiency and genuine interest in the customer she is working with.  So thank you Sylvia and your staff for truly helping a semi-hysterical customer worried about getting a cast off her foot meet her needs.   I will continue to use Toyota of the Desert because of Sylvia and her group of technicians dedication to customer service.<//Text>

I waited 4 hours to get the airbag recall fixed because they didn't have enough good parts on hand. Then the service writer failed to inform me that by getting your vehicle washed may crack your windshield......sure enough there car wash cracks windshields, DO NOT LET THESE PEOPLE WASH YOUR VEHICLE or you will end up replacing your windshield at your expense. The service writers need to start informing every customer that there carwash breaks windows. I will not be going back to get anything done from these people. I felt I was misinformed & now I'm stuck buying another new windshield (which I just put in 3 months ago) because the service writer failed to tell me about there car wash breaking windows. I'm definitely not a happy camper.
Since I'm unable to reply to the comment....I will reply here.
It was a brand new windshield 3 months old if the individual who replied to my comment would have read my comment thoroughly enough they would have seen this, so obviously even the owner (who replied) isn't representing the company properly. It's funny how they can let you know if your vehicle needs more work done to it so they can take your money, but they sure cannot go out of there way to let you know that their car wash cracks windshields when asking if you want it washed. Some poor management or maybe it's just another greedy method of big corporations trying to extort money out of people. Why anyone uses a dealership for anything more than a recall or warranty is absurd! Their pricing on parts is double/triple of what you can buy from an Auto parts store & IMHO just as good. Does anyone else wonder how much of that $135 an hour for labor the mechanic gets?<//text>

We wash over a hundred cars per day, and don't have a windshield break unless there is already a chip or crack and we are unaware.  If we know about a chip we don't wash the vehicle so as to not cause further damage.  Also, we apologize for the delay in getting the airbag recall fixed,but we are at the mercy of the manufacturer waiting on the parts."}</response>

Go to Geronimo because he is ethical, polite and professional. He made our experience very enjoyable and we left with the new purchased feeling confident that we closed a fair deal. We highly recommend Geronimo at Toyota of the Desert if you are shopping for a car.< /Review>

Wish I could give them a zero. An employee was rude during the entire transaction. He was going through to do a credit app to give us an estimate and did not disclose that it can affect our credit score. When I called him out for it he replied with "you're tripping". I then explained to him how credit apps work and he miraculously remembered it can affect your credit score. About "2-3 points". Went to Honda next door and got a way better deal then them. If you want to sell cars be decent human being, that's it. Thanks for the waters.<//text>

Awesome service. Although my wait was quite longer than expected, they let me know why. Everyone was really nice. BUT I really have to say they are awesome because they managed to squeeze in my car maintenance the same day I called, which was very much appreciated. Because of their service, I didn't have to backtrack the following day to get what I needed done. Thanks!</Review>

Having my 20k service while visiting the desert. All Toyota Centers ARE nice and this one is no exception. The  ambiance of this particular location is thus far my top favorite 😉.

This was unfortunately our third terrible experience with this dealership. First time we took my grandmother’s car here to be serviced, they didn’t put the engine back together properly and the check engine light came on on the way home. They were very reluctant to actually fix it and tried to say that they hadn’t caused the problem in the first place. 2nd time we purchased a 60k mile service which we were told included a transmission fluid change. The transmission fluid wasn’t changed and the advisor who told us it would be claimed he never said that. Just the other day the A/C blows debris out the vent and then dies. We checked the A/C system and found that the cabin air filter had disintegrated. It was supposedly changed out our last service in February and there is no way a brand new part would break that quickly. The only explanation I can think of is that they didn’t actually put in the new air filter as they claimed they did at our last service. I’m happy to dismiss one mistake. Even two. But this is the third time this dealership has either done shoddy work and/or lied about it. We will not be coming back.</Review>

Try to call for service appt. During summer they open at 9 am. Left name and number. Never received a return call.  Also went mid-week to pick up a Toyota Avalon purchased from there  and there were only 2 service writers with more than 6 people waiting. Left after 20 minutes.</review>

<Review>Bought two vehicles from this dealer in the last few months.  Great dealer, friendly and competitive.  Like the sales staff and their eagerness to make you happy.
Edwin, was a great sales person and happy to help you, even after the sale was complete a few days later.
I am a repeat customer, because of their service dept. which is more important then sales, as that is a one time experience, the service is a continual experience. And they succeed in this field. VERY IMPORTANT
Highly recommend this agency!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
I am writing to express my frustration with the service department at Toyota of the Desert.  Saturday morning when I started the car the check engine light came on.  The manual on the car says this calls for immediate service so I called the dealership.  We had purchased our 2016 Camry from TOD.  It took my over one half hour to reach a service representative.  I kept redialing hoping to speak with a person.  My call kept cycling back to the operator.  It was only when I begged the operator for help that I was connected to a person.  Jose suggested it was probably a gas cap problem but I should bring the car in on Monday.  He said to bring the car in at 9:00.  I considered this an appointment.  However when my husband arrived this morning they said we did not have an appointment and he would have to wait at least 90 minutes for service.  We consider this outrageous service.  Do not buy a car from this dealership unless you can get service elsewhere.  I just tried to post and the system does not allow a posting unless you light a star.  I don't believe they deserve any stars.  Their customer service and phone system are both horrible.</Review>

Run the other way! Fast! I had just signed the paperwork for my new Corolla and asked the sales manager, Amadeus Marcelo, if the interest rate was the best they could offer. He told me ‘if you don’t like it you don’t have to do business with us.’ Seriously? How does this man still have a job? Do NOT take your business here. Horrible sales experience.</text>

<Review>Worst customer service I have ever dealt with. They blow up my phone to try and get a trade in or get me in, run my credit, make an appointment to call me back and nothing. I call and leave voicemails and then they run my credit again but don’t call me to let me know any info.</Review>< pics>

<time>1524385281545</time><rating>1< /rating><text>If I could give this place less than a one star review I would. I just bought a used car from here a week ago, I came home and realized how over priced the car was that I bought. I wanted to return the car and get my old car back. I had read that they have 10 days to get a loan approved for the original contract I signed. I went in there trying to return the car or at least get into a brand new one for the price I paid. They told me no the contract is still in place but could never let me see a loan approval agreement. They tricked me into signing a new agreement telling me it was a way better deal than the first one because they literally couldn't take the car back, So came home and the next day I get a certified mail telling me the original contract is void because the loan wasn't approved. so they tricked me. I am very unimpressed with this place and I would never recommend anyone to every buy a car here. They are very good liars and don't let you exercise your legal right and when you try they act like they are in the right and you aren't. One of the guys actually told me that I was being recorded when I signed the first contact, like I was doing something bad about asking for the loan approval agreement,=. so basically if you're not very educated don't expect this place to give you any kind of "deal"</text>< Pics>

Went to look at used Prius. Had never been to dealership before.  Met a super nice knowledgeable sales person whose nick name is Ace.  Was just starting search and he was helpful, could answer my questions. Id go back.  I gave a 4 out of 5 as I never went in or have never used service department, but the guy a met in sales would bring me back.< /review>

It's okay the problem is the guy who he is in cars is just standing around talking with his friends not helping anyone.  When it's your first time here someone should tell you how the place works and not have you wait twenty extra minutes while you wait on their conversation to end with another service person.  Looks bad for the company.
Wake up people!!!< /review>

We have completed our second lease purchase with Toyota of the Desert.  Oscar, in sales is incredibly kind and professional and exceeds expectations in making his customers happy!!!  Jose in service is just at the top of his game too!  Always remembers me and is patient and kind!!

After letting Oscar know what I was trying to accomplish, he spoke with the finance/sales and they came up with a reasonable deal.  Was it the best deal?  Not sure because we didn’t want any cash spent out of pocket but they were very helpful and Jose in finance was excellent and explained everything and answered every question with patience and respect.  This was a much better experience than the one we had in January 2019.

Thank you Oscar, Santini, Jose and Jose!!< /text>

We took our car in for a recall. We were told the car was due for the 60,000 mile service. I asked what that entailed. We were told radiator flush, transmission fluid changed, fluids topped off, oil change, air and cabin filters changed. At a cost of $325. We thought that sounded reasonable so we said go ahead and do it. We returned 4 hours later. We talked with a different service adviser and he told us we should consider changing our transmission fluid changed next service. I said why? That should have been changed today. He said no thats the 90,000 service. I said well Manny told us that was part of the 60,000 service. When we approached Manny to ask about it he flat denied having said it. I was quite surprised. That being said there is no way I would have had that service done if I knew the transmission service was not included.< /Review>

I contacted this dealership on their website. Had a question about scheduling and another question about service. This was on April 17th. I was sent a auto reply. "We have received your request and one of our certified associates will be contacting you shortly." However NO one has contacted me by phone or email. Based on this I would not rely on Toyota of the Desert for service or sales. My vehicle is 10 years old and I am looking to replace. There are so many other Toyota dealers out there that do contact you. Don't place a "Contact us" link if you don't bother to reply. If they can't reply to your email, imagine what kind od service? I have found a Toyota Dealer that works for me. I have owned Toyotas since the 70s but I will not try again with Toyota of the Desert.</review>

<Review>Best place to purchase a Toyota in Southern California. The service department can use some work, one in particular employee was very rude as I took my truck in to get an oil change. One hour later my truck was ready to go and they did everything but the oil change.</Review>< name>

It was a very pleasant experience. Made it a lot easier for both us the buyer and them the seller to make the deal thanks to prior research online before going out. All the tools provided online on their website were very helpful. Never felt harassed like you usually do when you pull in to a dealer and the sales people almost come and open the door for you to get you out of the car and get a sale done. A+++ Customer service.< /text>

I love my Toyota but I say Buyer Beware... I was very offended by the sales agent remarking about how he noticed my blobs. I was blown away and would not send my family to buy a car here so I can not leave good feedback. Service center here Rocks but the sales team SUCKS...</Text>

Went to look at a used car and ended up buying a 2016 that I fell in love with on the showroom floor. My salesperson Tim Gross was terrific, no high pressure tactics. I felt a little pressure when the sales manager stepped in, and being a single woman buying a car is not easy. We finally came to an agreement and I really wanted the car so that was that. Did I get a good deal? Still skeptical but like I said, I love the car. Tim went over all the features with me so I wasn't flailing with all the technology I didn't have in my old car. Thanks Tim!<//text>

<Text>Worst dealership to work with, very unprofessional people. I had agreed on numbers with salesmen named Drew I even told him to hold a deposit on a Prius. They ran my credit yesterday after I had been working for months with an attorney on an identity theft problem to clean my credit, and had agreed on apr and also had other options. Even this day I was texting the sales guy to find out on my way to the dealership the car was sold this morning.

Even as a joke I told him to hide the key, (usual salesmen strategy)

So once I find out this, I call the dealership to see if there are vehicles similar I can buy since you guys had already run my credit. Crystal answers claiming she's in sales doesn't help me since she's not on a computer. Then she hung up on me. The general manager also hangs on me while I'm explaining my concerns. He goes and offers me a new Prius when I'm explaining what I'm looking for something I had agreed upon.

I was coming from 2 hours far... I was looking forward to doing business with you but honestly, the way you guys work and aren't accountable. You insist on getting a commitment from the customer, but when it comes to helping out, you're the most unprofessional personnel I have ever worked with. One person tells you yes, you take deposits, and the other one tells you no.

However, always the one that ends up losing it's the customer, and now I'll have a lower score all thanks to your incompetent ways and communication problems.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1560447947161, 'text': 'Hi Miily, we are very sorry that your experience with us did not end up being a positive one.

Anthony which i believe is one of their newer & younger coworkers was amazing to work with. He made my feel welcome and very very comfortable. He was so polite and for being new he did such a good job answering the questions that I had and took the time to explain to me my different options. I defiantly enjoyed my experience at Toyota of the Desert and will defiantly be coming back in the future & asking to work with Anthony!< /Text>

<review>The two door Scion tC we just looked at is the perfect fit for my college-bound son.  We wanted to find a safe vehicle that would be reliable and dependable, yet would be fun and sporty for him.  The young man who took care of us, Drew L., didn't try to show us cars that were not right for what we were looking for.  He was so knowledgeable about all of the cars and told us the pros and cons of each car as it applied to my son, from the obvious (our son didn't need a BIG car) to the not so obvious (our son would have fun and appreciate a moon roof).  Drew was a great car salesperson in that he listened to our wants and needs, with our son in mind.  Thanks again, Drew!< /review>< pictures>

Toyota maintenance department is a mess.  They Will pull you to their desk when you arrive and work with four to five different customers/ phone calls while you're in mid conversation.  Went in for oil change and to have my brakes checked due to screeching.  Left and my breaks were still screeching.  Went a second time in the same week because of this. The front clerk told me that the brakes were looked at by the lube shop department and it should've been looked at by a mechanic. I mean, I don't go to a plumber to have my teeth fixed!  So I Had to wait another three hours to have the mechanics take a look at my brakes.  Unbelievable, all of this should've been done the first go around. The clerks have no sense of awareness with parts.  You really have to be on your toes when dealing with this Toyota maintenance department or prepare to waste your time.< /review>

NO SERVICE after the car is sold, I have called multiple times spoke to multiple people (5) and not one returned my call. There was a defect on my car when I bought it,  that was to be repaired. I think their trying to make me/it go away, but no, even if I have to sue they will hold their end of the bargain.<//review>

Multiple issues with our buying experience, although keep in mind the vehicle being purchased was not on the lot when reading this. 1st- the sales person (Angle) was not knowledgeable about the vehicle options as he told my wife and I that it came standard with several items that when delivered it did not have. Such as, leather rapped steering wheel, 7inch stereo screen, and keyless entry on the SR Tacoma that we would have delivered. Minor issues but still not very knowledgeable about the options. 2nd- a copy of the purchase paperwork was not provided on delivery. 3rd- handed off to a sales manager that was not pleasant and should not be in that position due to the salesman being out of the office.

One week later after the general manager left the reply to have me contact him; he did not respond.< /text>

<Review>I was in the looking stages of buying a car. I was greeted by a salesman Drew Lindfield. He was very nice and gave me the info i needed in a proper manner. not pushy at all like past experiences. Drew took pride of where he worked and knew exactly what to do. When i am ready I am going to see Drew at Toyota Of the Desert!!!!< /Review><name>Colleen Flores<//name>< rating>

We’re able to buy our car after coming the second round..  Harry was great in providing info especially with car specs we’re looking, accomodating and was very patient in explaining the whole process. He always wants to make sure we’re comfortable with deal and always have that big smile! 😁😁😁. He’s a jem of the desert! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻< /Text>

So we bought the vehicle and the only complaint I had was once we got to actually buying the vehicle the finance guy told us many lies and got me to sign for a bunch of stuff I didn’t need and told me it lasted till atleast 100,000 miles but not it says it only lasts till about 60,000 and I’m paying extra for that he wasn’t there to make the process nice for us he was just trying to make sure I payed more for something I didn’t need. And later on I had body work done and the body work is very bad when you would expect it to be professionally done. And you expect it to be done right not half way done. They are very slow and not very good at what they are doing what they promise will be done right. Over all good sales man but other than that very horrible slow and low quality. Will not be coming back to waist much more of my time and money and be lied to.</review>< Resp>

I worked with Teo Miranda and ended up getting a 2019 Corolla hatchback and trading in my Hyundai. Teo made the process easy from start to finish.

After buying one vehicle from.them and leading another, you'd think that they would be in tge business of retaining good customers. This was not the case when the lease was coming up on my Scion tC Monogram Edition.

First the assistant service manager tried to put up a smoke screen when I told her for the second time the technicians had indicated they had rotated my tires, when they hadn't. Once, okay, fine. But two times in a row? She did everything to try and veer the conversation to something so completely off topic, that in the end she looked like a bumbling idiot.

I reported this to the service manager by email, that was a couple years ago. He still has not acknowledged my complaint or called me to find out exactly what happened.

If that wasn't enough, I approached the finance manager to locate a car I wanted to replace my leased tC. I had already done all the legwork and found the exact car I wanted at a dealer 25 miles away. He said he would call me the next day and let me know  when I could come in and sign the paperwork and pick up my vehicle. That was a couple years ago, and I still haven't received a phone call.

I reported all of this to Toyota Corporate - and guess what? They ignored my complaint completely. They didn't follow up on it. EVER!

Needless to say, I ended up purchasing a Hyundai instead which, it turns out, has much better premium featured th.c q. I would recommend staying far, far away from this place!< /text>

<Text>Excellent customer service by Ms. Calderón in the Service Department!  Ditto's the excellent professional treatment received from Mr. Lopez when purchasing the car.  The only negative was the lack of any communications responding to my inquiries regarding service. 5-stars for Calderón and Lopez...4-star rating overall because of 0-star rating for extremely poor email communications from Service through Customer Relations through a Vice-President.</Text>< Pics>

<text>First off Ryan Smith is fantastic! 5 stars to him! Everyone was super nice! I needed a car and they were there to help every step of the way! Now I rated this 4 because I had one problem with one person but it didn't effect my whole experience. They were I felt not understanding at all. Just kinda blowing my needs off and just wanted me to buy the car not really caring of anything else. Luckily she is not on the floor selling the car or I wouldn't of bought it there. But I did and for my first time they did great! Cheers to Ryan!<//text>< Pics>

these people need to work hard in their attitude. they speak to you like if they are doing a free favor to you where you can't ask questions cause they get mad and act like  you own them something...Bad Bad Bad attitude rude and unprofessional. other than that 2 hour waiting time is not a problem cause they told me the waiting was long but the attitude  ** starts

Update:

Wendy was super helpful with helping us working through our issues and we have chosen to trust the Toyota of the Desert again for future service and repairs.

Previous Review:

We brought our 2016 Toyota Camry in for service and tires.  We've had nothing but problems with the service department.  Our tires were delayed by a week when they told us they would be in the next day.  They said we needed a major maintenance which included a coolant flush and replacement.  According to the official Toyota maintenance report coolant doesn't need to be replaced until over 100,000 miles.  Our car has only 50,000 miles.  Once we drove it off the lot after the repairs were done the engine light came on an hour afterwards.  We brought the car back in and now they're saying there is a new problem with the oxygen sensor.  This is too much of a coincidence right after pick up.  There's reports of an oxygen sensor going bad from coolant and oil leaks.  Perhaps they may have damaged the sensor  and not taking ownership over it.  We've already paid $1,200 in repairs and now they want another $400 from us.  We have another car that we wanted to bring in for maintenance but now we're terrified that they're going to take advantage of us again.</text>

It is THE only Toyota dealership I will ever go to. Both of my experiences were great. The sales manager that worked with me was Ramiro Estrada. I had placed an inquiry online and he got back to me within minutes and was really helpful and took the time to go into work on his day off because it was the only day I could go to the dealership . That shows true commitment to his job and his dedication and passion for what he does. He helped me get the best deal on my 2013 Camry . I have owned only Toyota cars in the past and I am in love with my Camry . I will definitely recommend Toyota of The Desert to friends and family.

There was also another gentlemen that worked with us I believe his name was Armin Badzak (not sure how to spell his name) . He was very friendly and gave me a good deal on my 6 year warranty on the Camry . He was able to answer all my questions as well as my husbands questions. Very very very friendly man.< /Review><pics>None</pics><user_name>Stephanie Martinez-Garcia< /user_name><Date>1369812802738<//Date><Rate>5< /Rate><Response>None< /Response></record>

It's been over 6 hours waiting for my car to be returned to me for a simple tire purchase. No service, just new tires. I've left messages with Jose Maldonado who somehow manages to attach his name to every service order there, even though I booked my appointment online. One of his colleagues mentioned that he does double the service orders, I now think I know why. He likely poaches all the online bookings and causes this horrendous backlog with horrific customer service. Beware of Jose and don't believe their date time promised. My car was meant to be done by 10.40am, it's now 3.15pm and not even a call explaining why by Jose even when I left him a polite message 2 hours ago to please give me a call and let me know what was going on.

Although this place does a great job, they take forever! You can double the wait time of whatever they tell you. They suckered me in with "All Oil Changes to 50,000 miles for $X.XX." Well now I lose money if I take it somewhere else, but I don't want to wait 4 hours for an oil change. Today I even had an appointment, and they quoted me two hours! For an oil change! Sorry guys, not worth the wait.

**EDIT** And before Toyota replies to my review, I just read many reviews in which you apologize to dissatisfied customers and offer to appease them, after the fact. Instead of offering the squeaky wheels grease, why don't you change your policies and procedures so that customers don't get dissatisfied? Hire more people for service.

<text>I have been a TOD customer for over 25 years, having owned at least one Toyota all these years, and having bought a few through them. I am a big fan of Costco Auto Program, and although TOD didn't participate in that, they always matched prices on new cars, and deals on service. But they no longer seem to care. I recently asked them a quote on a new car, and beyond telling me that it was hard to get, they didn't bother to follow up. If this is how they treat a new car customer, caveat emptor for someone who already bought from them!</text></record></dataset><record>

I brought my 2010 Prius in today for a light bulb replacement, estimate of $90.  Kylee Krael was my Advisor.  Kylee was very knowledgeable, efficient, and friendly.  Kylee found a recall on my vehicle too.  When I picked up my car they had conducted the recall, replaced my "sub harness", light bulb, and washed my car...all at NO CHARGE!   Toyota of the Desert goes above and beyond...and their employees, like Kylee, are all STARS!  Thank you!<//review>

Cynthia in the Internet Sales Dept was wonderful, no hassle sale, in and out in an hour or so. no price haggling, made an offer and it was accepted. was a wait with finance, it would be great if "Internet buyers" had the abilty to deal with just the seller to speed things up and get them in and out right away as i have done so in the past with other dealerships.<//Text>

Quite simply put, our experience at Toyota of the Desert was top-notch.  Krishelle went above and beyond to assist us.  We had a complicated lease return but she made it smooth and stress free.  We appreciate the high level of service she and other employees of Toyota of the Desert gave us.  I can't say enough good about this place.  This is the second time doing business with Toyota of the Desert.  Looking forward to doing business a third time!<//Text>

< Review>
Went there on 1-11-19 to buy a used 2017 Honda Pilot the salesman Alex Viejon was great. When it was time to deal with the sales manager Amadeo Marcelo that is when things fell apart. He was very rude and very unprofessional. He walked away from me twice while we were trying to negotiate a price.. I asked if there was any wiggle room on a car we were trying to buy for $32,469.59 he took the paperwork from me and scratched off the .59 cents pushed the papers back at me and said I let you walk out of here so we did.. On 1-12-19 the next day I went next door to the Honda dealer and purchased the same car at the price I tried to work with him.. My recommendation start at the Honda dealer next door.. I know they are the same company but the sales manager will not insult you.. By the way I had my own financing and no trade in. Amadeo should find another job that doesn't involving working with the public.<//Review>

My experience with the sales person was not bad, he did try to play with me with the numbers, but I had done my math prior to going to the dealership. However, waiting to sign the paperwork took close to two hours. The Finance Manager Ramiro Estrada was rude and arrogant. I would recommend try to avoid him. Ramiro has no sense of customer service. I have a Due Bill for some work that the sales manager promised, the finance manager was not happy about it and tried to continue with  the paperwork without put it on paper until I refused to sign. I will be calling the dealership took get the work on the Due Bill done. I will post another review once the work on my Due Bill is completed.</text>

I went on Sept to get a car now i don't have credit well good credit. So i was recommended to go with this dealership because supposedly there really good at helping you out well they just played with my emotions. I don't want it to be a bad review but i would like to say that i had a lady very nice lady Mariposa help me out on getting a car and got me approve i was so excited . But unfortunate after a month that i was happy with the car they told me i had to return it back. I was so sad I'm a single mother of two with a full time job. So i really need that car thank fully I found an small little dealer that was able to help me out thank goodness . The thing is I don't like the fact that they give u a car with out telling you OH YA MAYBE UR NOT GETTING APPROVE BUT TAKE IT FOR NOW.like why do that to people why not just be honest. there was a guy name victor that took my car back when i had to go leave he was nice but not good at his job, I got a parking ticket through mail that i was in Los Angeles WHAT i live in Coachella I dont even know one down there. Well Mr Victor never took off the car under my name I called and ask if i can have the papers that i had sign off the car victor answer and said o okay i have to go look for them in boxes and ill call u back i was like  in boxes that fast I just sign off the car like 1 month ago and of course never got a call back thankfully i found my copy's and send prove that the car was not mine when that parking ticket happen overall dis-pointed i wasn't going to write a review but i get so many e-mails from them to rate on what a good job they did nope sorry they didn't except Mariposa she was really nice just didn't help as much</Text>

<Text>I came into Toyota of the Desert with no intent to buy at all I just wanted an idea of what kind of car im willing to purchase on my own for the first time. I was approached by a young man named Anthony D. He instantly greeted me and asked me what i was looking for. I let him know my situation and even though he knew i was not interested in purchasing a car in the moment he still suggested many models that matched my descriptions of cars i was looking into. He was a great salesman super smooth and did not make me feel pressured into buying at all. Overall i had an amazing first time experience at Toyota of the Desert. Anthony also handed me one of his employee business cards and we decided that in the future he is going to be my go to guy whenever i decided to make my purchase.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

We just bought a Honda from  Toyota of the Desert.  We found the service to be excellent.  Marcelo Pacibe was our salesman and he was a joy to work with.  He made the whole experience very pleasant.  They offered a very good price on the car and were quick to meet our needs and were very understanding .  The whole experience was a big thumbs up.<//review>

Buying a car can be a hassle but at Toyota of the Desert the whole process seemed simple and  easy I bout a used Toyota Camry. I was helped by salesman Edwin Morataya and the whole time he seemed  to be very knowledgeable of all the products there answered all my questions. That really made  my decision simple . If you are looking for a vehicle look no further than Toyota of the Desert .< /Review>

We purchased a certified used vehicle from here. It took 4 months for them to process paperwork with the DMV to get my license plates. The finance associate said he would only send out a credit inquiry to two creditors since I had excellent credit. A month later I checked my credit report and found they had submitted to over 15 different banks ! Only positive was the sales associate was great, but he was quickly replaced by a sales manager when we started negotiating pricing. I will never return for service or any future purchases again.< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Ivan Alvarado at Toyota of the Desert is my hero. I am on an road trip through the South West and unfortunately ran over a strip of a truck tire on hwy 10. My fender and something under the front got pulled out. We taped and tied it up til we got to PalmSprings. My friend said to just wait til we got home ( as an unknown mechanic might take advantage of me)and saw Jimmy Vasser Toyota but they recommended I check out with the local Toyota to make sure it was safe to drive home.
I was able to contact via their website right away and also talk to service person. I brought my Prius V in and Ivan fixed it all on the spot and said the damages were cosmetic and I should make it home safely. I owe him a lot as he could have had us make an appt ( we are leaving in the morning) charged us diagnostic fee and could have told me they would have to go expensive repairs. He has integrity was very professional and kind and got us on our way. I would refer anyone in the PalmSpring area to check out Toyota of the Desert ! If you do tell Ivan hi for me.

Went in for a maintenance of our Toyota and wanted to see what our options were for possibly upgrading to a bigger car. Not only did the salesperson not attempt to even pull up our payoff amount, or anything pertinent to our situation but we literally had to keep repeating information to him. We want to buy not lease, we asked for suggestions and nothing, etc. Just an awful experience all together<//review>

<text>I have purchased for cars here and I will never spend another dime at Toyota of the Desert.

Three days ago I purchased a used Corolla for my daughter. I had to leave for an appointment during the purchase process and my wife took over for me. At that time the manager , Jeremy, assured me that if anything was amiss with the car we could let him know the next day and he would take care of it. The car came with only one key and we needed a spare.

We were not asking for the keyless remote but just a plain key. They informed me that as the car had not come with a spare key we would have o buy one and that was just their policy. I spoke to to another person further up the food chain and he said the same thing.

This "policy" just cost them a loyal customer. Because they chose to stand on their short sighted "policy" and save themselves a $3 key and ten minutes of time, they have lost a customer that has given them nearly $100,000 of revenue in purchases not to mention the thousands in service purchases.

In addition, they created a person who will not hesitate to let every person they meet know what sort of service to expect.< /text><GmapID>0x80db032c208d8adf:0x26f09ca597bf8d0d<//GmapID><Rating>1<//Rating><Time>1427519170634<//Time><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I haven't been to TOTD for many years. It was because my negative past experience and most of the comments I heard from others were very similar to my own. Poor customer service, untrustworthy representatives, unsatisfied work and so on. For years my impression of TOTD was this and for that reason I never returned or recommended TOTD, "until now.'

My "maintenance required" light came on. The two mechanics I was familiar with were no longer at the shops. I was pressed for time and couldn't think of any other place than TOTD. Reluctant, I found myself pulling into the service department. A courteous young man greeted me then directed me to a service representative. All I could think about was that I was setting myself up for complete disappointment. Not being one to hold back I shared this with Chase (Service Rep.). He could not be nicer. I felt absolutely no pressure to buy anything or even stay for that matter. He offered to have their complimentary shuttle take me to work. Ed The driver was like an OL Friend. We chatted the whole time.
When my car was finished Chase called me with several options. I went in with intentions of only having one thing done but, I left with having several things done. Not once did I feel like I was being pressured. Chase made me feel more like he truly cared and was suggesting options I might want to consider if I didn't want to have everything done at once.

My car feels great. Im very happy with the service provided by TOTD and especially from Chase & Ed. It's because of them I will be returning and looking forward to them caring for my car as if it were their own.

Thank you Toyota of the Desert & Thank you Chase & Ed!

From A very satisfied customer,
Alfredo Gandara< /review>

3rd car I've purchased from Toyota of the Desert.  I ways taught that all car dealerships are crooks...not this dealership.  They broke that mold.  I've always been treated kindly and with respect.  I will never buy another car anywhere else.  Even if I lived on the east coast. I'd fly to Palm Springs and drive my new car home.<//Review>

This was my first car purchase in 15 years.  I dread dealing with dealerships but Toyota of the Desert was a very positive experience.  There was no pressure. The sales person, Maggie Kovaly, was very helpful, professional and took care of every question and need.  She went beyond my expectations. They took care of every issue and concern I had.  The entire staff goes out of their way to make sure their customers are taken care of.  Thank you for making my Toyota Camry XSE purchase such a positive and pleasant experience.   And thanks for the popcorn. I loved the snack. Thanks again.</Text>

<review>Do not buy from Toyota of the Desert! And don't buy a Camry! I purchased a brand new Camry six months ago and had several problems. The engine check light came on at 11K miles (not the maintenance light that comes on for the scheduled maintenance) and I had to pay $110 just for the testing. I have been diligent in getting the normal scheduled maintenance done, but why did this light came on?  This dealer was not able to find a problem or fix it.  All they did was re-set the system and charge me $110 for pushing some buttons.<//review>< pictures>

Don't make any quick decisions. They like to add extended warranties and high priced add-on insurance. Their final offer was 1/3 less than their first. Yes! I was looking at a lease and the payments went from $314/mo to $229 (upfront did not change). I can assure you I didn't do anything but get an hour older while I was there but somehow the terms available changed a great deal. Even at that the terms were higher than those advertised by other dealers. Also asked about buying my existing lease car -- the loan terms were the equivalent of a 15% interest rate -- I have excellent credit. Watch these guys very closely -- their shenanigans would make a thief blush. They do have a good inventory and they smile nice while they are trying to take advantage of you.<//Text>

Unfortunately I can't say the same thing about the shuttle ride home, my driver was great but the shuttle van was horrible, I don't understand how a dealership so big can have such an unsafe shuttle van, the entire van would shake every time we would come to a stop, the shaking was so bad that the shuttle driver would have to shift the van to neutral so it wouldn't shake as bad. I'm sorry to the drive, he wasn't the problem, the unsafe ride was the problem. Good luck service customer seeking a safe ride home or to work!< /text><Rate>1</Rate>< gmap_id>

Million dollar location yet you have to be the one that brings up what's covered under your warranty. One would expect for them to remember what you qualify for instead of you having to dig through it but no. They always seem to forget what you already paid for and want you to pay again.<//Review>

< Review>
Had my truck there for a bout 3 weeks for them to flush out bad gas out of gas tank and fuel lines. When I got it back the engine compartment had rat foot prints all over it and also rat droppings everywhere. They left some hose clamps still loose they where not even tightened up. Oil was splashed all over the fan and radiator . Front of truck and fenders had greasy hand prints all around it. Also the hood had calcium build up from the from to the wind shield. I contacted the dealer And corporate office to let them know that I had pictures to prove what the truck looked like when it was towed in to the dealer And their customer relations person named Wendy told me that their service guys said truck was dropped off that way so that's how I was getting it back. All she could do is give me 100 dollars for a detail. Even after I sent her pictures showing proof of what it looked like and she said no my service guys said that's how u dropped it off. So I guess the way they left some of the parts on motor loose must of bin me too. It's a new 2017 tacoma that looked trashed and their resin for not washing it was because my windshield was cracked. So why not wipe off the grease that ur tech left all over the truck and also why not double check the work the did to the engine. I will never go there no matter what and toyota corporate after telling them also that I had proof and pics of my truck before and after all they could say was "sorry that happen to u" . That was it no help from the what so ever. So basically out of pocket I had to Come up with the money to pay for the repairs to the paint job on hood and to clean the motor and have some one look over it again. Thanks alot toyota ur guys are a peace of work.< /Review>

Spent the weekend in the desert and my Toyota Camry was due for a service. Toyota of the desert is the best service experience I've ever incountered, (12th service), fast, efficient, and a wonderful place to hang out while the car was being worked on. I highly recommend Toyota of the desert.</Text>

Cynthia Tinoco is the BEST! Helpful, easy to work with, honest and sincere. We did the entire transaction over the phone. She always responded immediately to emails, calls and texts. She was able to accommodate me when I needed the car shipped 250 miles from the original destination on the morning it was leaving their lot! Overall a wonderful Toyota buying experience, even more so if you have ever tried to deal with buying a Toyota in Las Vegas!

PS- we got a killer price as well.<//review>

Excellent across the board. I began my search for my perfect vehicle on the internet, and received excellent service and responses through email from the staff at Toyota of the Desert. When the time came I was weary about driving almost 2 hours past numerous Toyota dealerships to get my chosen vehicle, and as it turns out I would do it again. From the moment we parked the service was great, everything moved along at a nice pace, and the staff was open about the sales process and listened and answered all of my questions. The outstanding service was provided by Ms. Cynthia Tinoco. I feel it was definitely worth the drive and I will recommend Toyota of the Desert to all of my friends.</text>

I had the best experience with Toyota of the Desert.
I had to return my lease by May 12th.  I went to Ford because I was a
prior customer before I had to decide weather to return my car to Kia.
I went to Ford twice and they only wanted to sell me a used car with 23,000 or 40,000 miles on it.  They basically told me there was nothing they could do.  My credit is excellent.  Well I finally went to Toyota and Mario De Angelis
was such a pleasure to work with.  He got me a deal within 1/2 hour with what I could afford to pay and off I went.   I am now a Toyota Customer for life.   Thank you all so much.</Review>

From the very start of our negotiations for leasing our RAV 4 Drew Linfield and  Lulu Gil is the winning team . This two individuals handled us exceptional and very professional . If all sales persons are exceptional like them I will definitely give them recommendations. Toyota of the desert are lucky to have them.< /Text>

Hi I'm just writing this email to let you know how disapointed for the first time I am with Toyota of the desert. After buying 3 cars and referring to every single family member. Wich at least 3 members bought a car this year. we visited Toyota of the desert on May 25th 2018 around 6 p.m. met with JD,  we asked him to take us to Mary Pickford to see a truck, that my son liked it on his previous visit and compare to the one in the showroom ,  he avoided taking us to Mary Pickford, for that was a little disappointed being my son first attempt to buy a car he has a good credit and we were willing to sign as a co-signer, same way we did with my oldest son,  , after we saw the MSRP on the truck window on the showroom we decided to go for that truck. words that JD used like  , that's too much truck for you, those words were hurtful , he could have used words like the loan that you're getting is a little bit big for your credit.. after looking at the truck in the showroom MSRP JD realize it was the wrong MSRP in the truck he noticed the truck was lifted and has different tires, he keeps pushing to pick a different truck, because he didn't know what was on the truck what price was it, being the wrong MSRP on the window. 3 hours after not getting any price on the truck we decided to leave, then the floor manager came trying to explain us without any paper on hand what was in the truck even he wasn't sure, what was on the truck, he was just guessing and you cannot make any kind of purchase based on guesses we are willing to come back and make a deal when a truck like the one on the showroom with the correct price on it. just to have my son go through a good buying experience. Thanks for your past service to my family and friends hopefully we'll see you again.

Sincerely

Gilbert Richard<//Review>

<text>I spoke to Jerry. Just like the previous reviews, they tried to play me with the numbers. & then when I called them on it, they became irritated and lashed out with extreme pressure, even providing misinformation regarding purchasing from another dealer. They have a 4k "dealer upcharge" for the Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro, and while there are other dealerships that try to state there is an up charge for this vehicle, I've never been so pressured and talked over in my life by a car salesman. I have also come to find, that Toyota of Tustin, Toyota of Culver City, and Toyota of Redding are all dealers who DO NOT PLAY when it comes to the numbers, and DO NOT have a "dealer up charge". Obviously everyone can have different experience, however my advice would be to stay away from Toyota of Palm Desert. Nobody wants to be pressured, misinformed, or made to feel uncomfortable when buying a new car or truck. Only reason I gave two stars instead of one is because I was told today that the general manager would "reach out" and make things right, because obviously they were wrong to have made me feel the way they did.<//text>< Time>

Got a great deal on a Prius lease - called around to dealers all over southern CA and this one really delivered.

Excellent experience - all went exactly as discussed and agreed upon.</review>

<text>Normally, I don't write reviews of dealerships since there's usually nothing good to say.  Things were pleasantly and distinctly different at Toyota of the Desert with Cynthia Tinoco.  Cynthia, Sunshine, and the others we worked with made for a truly excellent purchasing experience, something that I had assumed was impossible given the many bad days I've spent at other dealerships over the past 30 years. The truck we purchased was exactly what we were looking for, and everyone we interacted with was professional, courteous, and personable.  The whole purchase process took less than an hour and a half, and was completely absent of any high pressure tactics.  I would not hesitate to direct my friends, colleagues, and family members to Toyota of the desert and Cynthia Tinoco.<//text><user_name>Russell Louks<//user_name></record>

I purchased my first Prius at a different dealer but came here for service. Julio is the reason I keep returning. I have a second vehicle from another dealer near Toyota of the Desert and they can't even come close to the excellent service I receive from Julio.
When I mentioned to Julio that I was planning on purchasing a new hybrid and was thinking of a Honda or Nilsson, he insisted I give Toyota of the Desert a shot.
I'm glad I did. We met Maggie who was knowledgeable but not over-bearing at all.
She answered our questions and when I told her I wanted to think about it, she didn't push me.
I returned the next day to test drive the car and Maggie worked to get me a deal I could work with.
I never felt "pushed into" anything and feel I got a fair deal .
Thank you all, especially Maggie and Julio!<//Text>

<review>This place is an absolute abortion when it comes to service. If you want to give them money and buy a new car every time you come in then I suspect you would be treated like a human but if they already sold you a vehicle you might want to get used to waiting in lines and getting the run around on the phone that no one ever answeres but the front desk clerk who knows absolutely nothing about anything. They are snobby and argumentative if you ever express a lack of satisfaction. As well as completely neglegant In there business practices since they decided to send out keys in an uncertified package back to an address that they didn't confirm while they were aware we were on vacation for 2 weeks. This carelessness caused our brand new 2017 tundra to be stolen from directly off the yard since the thief had a full set of keys and 2 weeks of no one there. Do not do business with these people because in the event that something horrible happens they will hang you out to dry.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

My experience in Toyota was one of a kind as a serious buyer i had to find the perfect car that i know i would really enjoy driving, the sales man was very patient with me and that's something I highly appreciate because I didn't wanna rush myself into choice i could possibly regret after some time. Luckily i found the right car for me it's really fun to drive it's a great experience for me, thanks to the sales man who took the time to notice the type of cars that caught my attention and eventually refered me the perfect car for me. I am very happy with it and am thankful to ruben of Toyota of the desert.
Love my new Toyota Corolla iM<//review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Review>Extremely POOR service from Toyota of the Desert.  Incorrect information and endless waits at check in from "Service Advisors"  who know ZERO about the mechanics of a car.  The mechanic did a horrible job.  We are still trying to fix the loud, annoying squeek that was created when he put the car back together.  (We don't live in the area.)  As part of the repair, he replaced the lock on the glove compartment.  When I tested it the entire lock came out attached to the key.  Unbelievable!!  I waited over 2 hours for the pick up service when they told me they would arrive right away.  Horrible place!!!!  If you have to go there for warranty work, realize you will have to return more than once to get the job done correctly.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

We bought my wife's first new car in ten years here and it was so broken that we couldn't take the car home. This wasn't the dealer's fault, but they were asked to fix it before we took possession of the car. Thankfully, they found us a new one which was great, but processed the paperwork on both cars which meant that we had two loans! My wife had to call Toyota corporate to get it straightened out. The first broken car was still in our name! As far as the buying experience, I won't be back. The sales guy started off with the usual paint sealer, security system add ons that jacked up the price and have long been apart of the reason why people hate buying cars in the first place. Having bought cars here and I-10 Toyota, they both are about the same. I'll be buying out of the Valley from now on.< /review>

<Text>Baffled by the glowing reviews here.  Does anybody read Yelp? Or does Google let them cherrypick the reviews?

Twice when I've brought my Prius here for service I've been overcharged--without them receiving authorization first.  Most recently a $330 90K service had an extra $200 added to replace 4 spark plugs.  How is replacing spark plugs not park of a major 90K service?  No explanation, no excuses, just "that's what it costs"

Never again--I'll take my car out of the valley where there's some competition and they'll work to keep you a satisfied customer< /Text>< Rating>

Buying a car is generally worse than a trip to the dentist.   The inefficiency of the process at most dealers is maddening.   Toyota of the Desert, however, is different.  Over the weekend my wife and I exchanged our lease-expiring Sonata for a Prius.  The process could not have been more pleasant.  Your salesman, Tony Spiel, and the folks ivolved with the deal exhibited the highest level of professional conduct I have ever experienced at a car dealer; they were sensitive to our needs, which are shaped by my wife’s serious illness, and are significantly limited.
While we are not currently living in the desert, if we need another car, we will take another vacation week-end and visit your dealership.  Thanks for a pleasant and productive experience.

My experience was horrible. Bad customer service. They took the keys from my wife and I so somebody else could test drive our new car. While we were right there. I needed to contact financial managers, I called ten times and they still didn't get through even after I left voicemails. These people have horrible customer service and Estella, my sales woman, was too quiet and not aggressive enough to even get a sale. She only got one because we wanted the car. The dealership was unimpressing and I recommend a different Toyota. At least the cars they sell are nice, because this dealership is the worst I've ever dealt with, uninviting, and poor at their jobs. Extremely dissapointed.</review>

<review>I  bought  a  Toyota Tacoma 3 weeks ago .. This dealer it's the worst bunch of liars . The  finance guy that help me promise me he was going to match the gap insurance from Altrua credit union and found out he didn't he just said it to  satisfied  me just to make a sale . Waited almost 6 hours then when I was
leaving they had the right truck but wrong VIN number on the contract they had to resummit a new contract again then a week after he calls me saying he has a better deal that my payment will go lower by 4 dollars less but the APR higher .The same week I had a appointment to get the truck tinted and the service desk  Advisors 2 of them were arguing over who was going to do my paper work .

(NEVER GOING BACK TO THAT DEALER AND I DONT RECOMMEND NO ONE TO THIS DEALER )<//review><rating>1<//rating><Gmap_id>0x80db032c208d8adf:0x26f09ca597bf8d0d< /Gmap_id>< Time>

<Review>Both Cynthia Tinoco (helpful at the end of negotiation, post-purchase) and Wade Whittingham (initially structured the auto selection plus leasing options) assisted me in putting a reasonable lease deal on my 2013 Prius c.  The Finance manager to whom I was assigned helped streamline the paperwork smoothly, especially late in the day.  I experienced a swift learning curve in switching from a gas-only to a hybrid-efficient auto, all in all a very pleasant experience.< /Review>< pics>

<text>The salesman brandon that help me to find the  right car was very helpful and the service Manager Sidi help out alot to get me the right price for my car. And the Financial Manager that did my paperwork did a great  job to get me at the right payment on car and get me the extended warranty  on car also. And there was another salesman help me with the Bluetooth  to my phone and showed all the features in car about the stereo and phone features and about the gear changing features. Thank you so much toyota of the desert. I  will recommend  other people that I  know to come your way when purchasing  a automobile  from you!!!😊😀</text>< UserId.>

I just bought a new 2013 Scion X B at Toyota of the Desert. Everything went smooth,  I had been in contact with William Loeb in the Internet Sales Dept in advance, when I got there the ground work was done. He knew exactly what I was looking for. Very happy with Salesman William he made sure we were taken care of while there, he was very proffesional. and until I was ready to drive off explaining everything about my new Scion
X B.< /text>

<text>I was given a price via email by the internet sales manager, Victor Lopez, that I agreed with and I decided to make the drive down to Toyota of the Desert the next day to make the purchase. I informed Victor that I was on the way from Riverside. As I'm pulling up to the dealership after an hour drive he calls me to tell me that there was a deal being negotiated on the vehicle....even though we had just communicated hours earlier on meeting for this vehicle. When I mention this, he tells me, "sorry buddy, but I didn't promise to hold the vehicle for you". Not a good start.
So Victor shows me the vehicle and then we walk into the showroom. After a few minutes, Victor and the sales manager, Santini Pompa, comes over and tells me that the price Victor had emailed me was a mistake, that Victor had looked at the wrong numbers and miscalculated the price he sent me the day before and would not be honoring the deal.
These two sales managers are the type of guys that give car salesman that bad reputation. I wasted a lot of time and gas driving down to this unscrupulous dealership.< /text>< date>

<Review>Dishonest and Deceptive!
When I purchased my vehicle in 2014 I was clear that I was going to put 25K miles per year and thus a lease would not make sense. I was also clear I was only in the area for 1.5 years and could not take the vehicle with me when I left the area, so again, a lease did not make sense. They told me the best thing to do was purchase the vehicle (a Prius) and that as long as I take good care of it and service it regularly, I could sell it back to them, and at most I might be slightly under water. I was told "even a Prius with high mileage will hold its value out here." I was also sold an extended warranty as they said it would increase the value of the car and I could get a refund when I sold it back to them. Of course, I should have realized they would say anything to make the sale with NO INTENTION of honoring what I was being told. No refund and now under water by over $8,500.

Went back in last week and the best offer they would give me for the vehicle put me under water by close to $8,500!!! The purchase cost was about $33,000 and when I purchased it I was told it would likely be worth about $24,000 today. The payoff is around $25,000 and the car is in mint condition, other than having high mileage. Went in last week and the best offer they would give is $15,500!!! Sold it to CarMax for $17,000 and now Toyota is telling me I cannot get a refund on the extended warranty either! Needed to sell the car since I am moving and cannot take the vehicle with me.

Had I known the car would devalue this much I never would have purchased it. Would have come up with some other option. Again, it is clear they will say anything to make a sale and could care less abut being truthful.

For this reason I would advise everyone to NEVER use this dealership. Go somewhere where you might be given accurate information when making a decision. I know car salesman are slimy, but I have never had such a horrible experience with a dealership.

As I said, they are incredibly dishonest and deceptive.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1437163108306, 'text': "Todd, we are sorry to hear that your experience in selling your car was not as anticipated.

<Text>Purchased a 2016 used Honda civic August 5th 2016... Paid with a personal check... Check cleared my bank Aug. 8th. Waiting for pink slip and registration to come from DMV.. August 29th I called the dealer and left 2 messages for call back... No one responded and I called and asked General Mgr. to help me talk to someone.... I got a call and was told that the paperwork was still on desk at dealership... They said that they have to hold paperwork until check cleared... I explained check cleared back on Aug. 8th and why wasn't the paperwork sent to the DMV then... I got the run around and no one ever told me what was going on. I still have not received a reason after talking with 2 office girls and a General Mgr. and the salesman that sold me the car... I paid in full they had their money in 3 days and if I hadn't called Aug. 29th the paperwork would still be at the dealers instead of sent to the DMV...At this point I'm still not sure what's going on.... This is a terrible way to treat a customer...I deserve an explanation...</Text></record></dataset><record>

I just recently bought a car from this dealer for my college student son.. the care is great we have no complaints .. but one thing that i have a complaint about is that when they are back and forth trying to make a deal with you on  a monthly payment   they tell you the price..and they also tell you that it will come with an extended warranty.. but what they dont tell you is thaf it will cost you 2500.00 dollars.. i was very disapointed with that part of the deal.. i sent an email to the fince guy that help us to try to cancell that warranty.. after all the car i bought only has 20,000 miles.  But he never reponded. Then i called and told another guy there what had happened and he told me he would have someone contact me back.. and no one ever did..  i feel so mad and sad that they ripped my son for 3000.00 dllrs.. for a warranty that they never even explained or gave me any paper work as to what was going to be covered or if i had any deductable..i am mad that all they think of is just how they can make more comission from people that work hard for their money..</text>

<Text>Our wonderful dealer Maggie took us through the paces and test drives and we settled on a SCION XB. We had been in a nasty accident a week before and she was careful to guide us in detail about every feature in all of the vehicles we tested.
She knows her stuff!
She made the experience not only easy but often pleasurable.
She was a pro and all business when it was necessary but never lost the human connection that is so a part of a purchase this meaningful.
The follow up calls were not expected and very welcomed. She and Sunshine who helped us understand the console and Bluetooth set up, made sure we were enjoying the car and made a point to say that any glitch we didn't understand was easily addressed if we would bring the car into the on location shop.
And they made the point also that the warranty was in effect and no expense would be incurred for this service.
We had gone to other dealerships in the area and Toyota of the Desert is not only efficient and professional but ultimately personable. We have sent other friends there and they too have enjoyed the congenial and non pressured service.
The very attractive showroom also adds to the buying experience. The team from Maggie to Sunshine, to Davin made the whole event go smoothly and  every concern or question was answered and addressed easily.
You all have a great team there and you know your product. That was a point that some other places never came up to.
We are enjoying the SCION XB ...Only a few concerns have come up. The small amount of in cab storage space, the fact that the USB connection is buried in the armrest console, and that there was no hard cargo cover included in the sale.
These however are not the fault of the sales team.
You guys should be proud of your professional standards and I hope more people can experience this sort of good team work in a personable and congenial atmosphere  as we have.< /Text>< user_name>

I am in the process of buying a car.  I am so pleased with toyota's salesman, Daryll Pryor.  He is soft spoken, no high pressure, considerate, respectful, and very knowledgeable.  Good sense of humor.

Toyota of the Desert, should be very proud of Daryll, because the one thing he does that very few auto salespeople do is make his customer feel that they are his number one priority.

Go see Daryll.</Review>

I had a positive experience at Toyota of the Desert with two purchases of certified used cars, first a 2008 Yaris, and more recently a 2011 Prius. Both times the sales process went smoothly and I got into a car that was the perfect fit. The first time I came to the dealership in an ‘urgent’ situation when my old Saturn was beyond repair, and the salesperson worked with me to get into a base model Yaris that was the perfect start for a newer car. That experience, along with the friendly approach, really sold me on this dealership. When I came back the second time my experience wasn’t as good at first, getting into a certified used Corolla that I had problems with. But, the true measure of a business is how they respond when things go wrong, and in the end they were very willing to work with me. All said, I was able to get into a certified used Prius in pristine condition. I really appreciated the salesperson taking his time to explain all the features, and take me on a test drive where I could check out handling on both uphill and downhill driving. I trust Toyota’s reputation for certified used cars, and the warranty options are great. My experience with their service department has been excellent as well. If you’re an online shopper like me, you will find the ‘Real Deal’ and Carfax links very helpful, and I’ve always seen a good selection of certified used vehicles. Thanks to all who worked with me at Toyota of the Desert!<//Text>

Great experience at Toyota of the Desert!  Genaro Bautista's positive and outgoing attitude made the experience fun! My husband and my credit was not great due to terrible economy in 2010.  We slowly bounced back and stopped by to JUST LOOK at cars.  We figured we still needed time to improve our credit score.  Genaro and manager Shawn crunched the numbers, looked at our job & home ownership history.  Shawn looked at Genaro Bautista and said...get it done.

Well today was my 42 nd birthday and I didn't want the 2013 Toyota Camry Sport Edition that were outside in the lot....I know I was pushing my luck  when I said I wanted the Black one on the showroom floor ( horsing around cause I know that one is spotless, super clean, waxed and immaculate)...... Without hesitation, and without us knowing, Genaro Bautista, had them open the showroom floor doors and it was hand delivered with professionalism.

WOW!  I was playing around....its their show floor model.....bur Genaro took the extra step and said....thats what you want...its your birthday.....its a done deal.   FINALLY!!!!    A business that remembers......NO EXCUSES, NO ATTITUDE, CUSTOMER COMES FIRST.  All my friends already have received a text message to of a photo of my and my birthday gift and a MESSAGE...GO SEE GENARO BAUTISTA AT TOYOTA OF THE DESERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><text>Cynthia Tinoco was my sales rep.  She did a wonderful job representing Toyota of the Desert.  I pirchased a 2012 Prius C (color moonglow).  I have owned my car for a week.  I really love my new car.  The synergy drive of the Prius makes the car a whole new fantastic experience behind the wheel.  I am 72 years old and a retired Air Force pilot.  Except for flying jets, the Prius has been the most staisfying driving experience.  I love the quiet drive and the MPG is fantastic!  I hope in the future the maintenance will be minimal. Only time will tell.  One thing Prius C owners should know when first driving the car home for the first time.  When the key is removed from the steering wheel column, a red flashing light will blink and remain ON 24/7 until the registered key is put back into the steering column.  This is the immobilizer warning light.  It is a theft proof warning light against potential car thieves.  Also, an amber Passanger Air bag light will remain ON when driving the car if no passenger is sitting in the front right seat.  These two warning lights On is normal operation for the Prius C.  The Prius C dealers should prepare new drivers seeing these lights ON is normal when driving home for the first time.  Overall, I would give Toyota of the Desert an A rating...<//text>< pictures>

To get car I want there to get a new car they scratched my car and blamed it on me and when I returned the car back to Deler they did not report Toyota financial 1 month then I had to proof them that I grounded my car 30 days a go so it won’t effect my credit report, if you want peace after buying a car never by your car from this Dealership.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80db032c208d8adf:0x26f09ca597bf8d0d<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
