< Review>
Highway 29 is the best place to buy your favorite Heavy Hitters carts! I know this because I’m the account manager for Mammoth Distribution, and I know they’ve got an amazing selection! They also have a great selection of edibles, tinctures and wellness products, and flower! This place is a one stop shop, the employees are friendly, chill, and are willing to help you find exactly what you need! I love shopping here, I can always find something I want from their awesome selection!</Review>

<time>1580368963088</time><Text>I love this dispensary, the staff is very inviting and friendly, they really know their products as well. They recommended exactly what I needed when I described my medical problem. I trust in their recommendations and will continue coming back to them for all my needs. Also when I've seen them out in the public they remembered me and asked how the products I chose worked and told me of new items I may want to try that came in.  They are my second family and I know they really care about their customers.

This was always my go to place at least once a week mainly because of the employees, they are great especially clarence! Would have given 5 stars but a little disappointed i bought a $65 gram of brass knuckles concentrate cartridge a few days ago that was defective and they did not exchange it, i have had more problems with this brand! Anyhow i will be back but will now check out the other places too!<//Text>

Nice, clean and convenient. The other cannibis shops are in bad parts of town. This shop has specials sometimes of $25 per 1/8th so stock up then and avoid the bad parts of Vallejo at the same time. Vary very friendly and helpful, and knowledgeable staff. Five stars!<//Text>

I tried to go in to another dispensary down the road. Med license in hand and military Id in hand. I was turned away. I was off to find someone more compassionate and I had my proof of insurance proving I was a resident just in case. Didnt need it. The gentleman who watches the door, always holds it open for people as the come in or leave (one of the only places that still hold the door for a lady) signing up or being a repeat customer is a breeze. I never have experienced a wait. Budtenders are usually beyond friendly. They always get my military discount on there. I do wish there were more flavors and options for gummies. Every time I go in the shelves are empty. So, maybe keeping more in stock so I'm not running back and forth from Fairfield so much. I also wish you had cheeba chews. Then, this place would be my one stop shop. Still, the most friendly dispensary in this area w good prices and good product.<//text>

One of my favorite dispensaries. They even have a view of their flowering grow room, where they grow most of their premium in house flower.<//text>

I came to get some CBD capsules for the arthritis in my knees, can't handle any percentage of THC. Unfortunately the vendors that was supplying this could not get their paperwork together so no product for now. I have no idea how the prices and quality of all the other products since that's not what I came for. I purchased a CBD patch that was $30 and was suppose to last 3 days...but it didn't.< /review>

The only reason I went there was because they still had 500mg and 1000mgs of Korova, they don't anymore. No one does to my knowledge. They guys were so stoned it was weird and unprofessional.   I won't be back to buy anything< /Text>

High quality everything! Great flowers, great concentrates, highest quality vapes I've found (golddrop). Not to mention,  their budtenders Geren, Cristina & Clarence ROCK! These guys are knowledgable, friendly & super efficient.  Even better,  they give you a punch card & for every $20 you get a punch, fill up the $300 card, you get $20 off your best purchase or a free gram!
Of 6 other clubs in vallejo, this one is definitely THE BEST!< /Text>< Pictures>

It is my first time visiting this bar, and you have to go! It’s the cutest little spot with amazing food. The food and alcohol are to die for. The service I received was so amazing, and I will definitely be back again. They made me feel welcomed and gave me an amazing experience. IT WAS FIRE!!</review>

<time>1579763874925<//time><rate>1<//rate><review>This has potential to be popular only problem is some of the Bartenders seem to ignore women who they don't know.  I like to go here on way home or when I'm the driver for people I know who are drinking.  I come to have a soda. I have stopped telling people to go here. The Bartenders who are here now totally ignore me when I come in. Tonight I timed her 12min. Only reason she finally served me was because 3 guys came in and she had to go by me to serve them.  I still tip the dollar.  The old bartender was friendly and polite enough to not charge for the soda designated drivers should have soda for free as long as they at least tip.< /review>< Pics>

This neighborhood tavern has been here for a few years. Though, when we stopped in, I found out that it was under new management and they had only been open 3 days. One of the owners was there (there's 3) and he seemed very nice. The server (I think her name is Tara?) is experienced, friendly and nice. I will be going back.<//review>

I have been going to that spot for over 10 years, when it was jollies.. not going to lie, I loved jollies but wasnt the same when it became Thirsty ox. So i desided to go tonight after hearing there was new owners and let me tell u, I was able to meet both new owners and they are so awesome, friendly and make it there priority to know u.. there bartenders are attentive and very friendly. I hope to see our old school bar be great again.. Thank u Camel and Joby for taking on a great neighborhood bar and bring us back!!< /review>

this place is very nice. 5 stars.
Drinks are well priced. Monday madness is the best! 4 bucks for pretty much any drink after 7. Can't beat that anywhere!</text>

If you like dive bars, this is the perfect spit to go. Staff is friendly and the locals are welcoming. Also, it's extremely clean for a dive bar.</text>

< review>
Bartenders are great, beer selection is decent but ambiance is on a downward slope. When it rebranded to Thristy Ox I had very high hopes for this place. Crowd was very eclectic and fun. Younger to older​, a very representative swath of what Oxnard truly looks like but visit after visit it seems to be reverting back to Jolly's. Older crowd only playing old school. That might be want it will ultimate become and that's fine too but it could be so much more.<//review>

I was there today for horse nails. It's a long story but let's just say it had nothing to do with horses. I have brought my chicken feed there, and rabbit food and I bought alfalfa and a couple bales of hay and I buy bird seed there.  They've got lots of fun stuff that's like little gift items but really it's for people that actually do raise animals. Nice employees that are willing to offer good service.</review>

The owner is super helpful and nice.  And the place smells fantastic...like fresh hay and high quality leather.  It is fun to browse the well crafted selection of leather goods and the best place to buy alfalfa, hay, and grain.< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Farm animal feed for wholesale prices!!  I have chickens I buy 50lbs bag for only 13 bucks.  I was paying 15-20 bucks for a 25lbs bag different other places before I found them.  They also have bales of hay and straw for affordable prices.  You pay for what you want, you give the receipt to one of the guys who work there and they will carry them 50lbs bag to your vehicle.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

The lady there is always very helpful and very friendly the worker that will load your vehicle with any supplies that you buy is always nice and friendly and always ask you to help it seems like he never wants to see you carrying things he wants to do it for you it's a place I went to once about 12 years ago and have never stopped going back</review>

Costomer service before the loan vs costomer service after you get the loan. I am a Veteran who for some stupid reason decide to get a loan. I have paid half of the loan in interest and balance remaining for 90 % of the loan. Do without!!!!!!!!!! It is not worth it! You can pay it off  sooner if you decide to they told me. But they want to charge me more money. I am concdering of getting a lawer. Do not get a loan ....do without. Angry Army Veteran!!!<//Review>

<review>I told the lady I needed my checks for Gasoline and she said OK. After she took the checks she gave me this credit card and told me I can buy clothing, food, groceries, etc but that I could not buy gasoline neither cash. I re-estate to her that I needed the money for gas not food, I asked her for my checks back and she said I'm sorry I can't do that and called the next person in line. Never go there. Besides they asked you for too many personal questions that are not necessary like my taxes.</review>< rating>

I still dont understand how complicated it is to read and then double check to make sure the order is correct by the TWO workers who make and package your food.

I ordered two steak bowls one with brown rice and one kids chicken bowl.

I receive ONE steak bowl with brown rice and TWO CHICKEN BOWLS.....

That is clearly not what was printed on the receipt.< /review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Absolutely rude service by Richard H. My check #118
How can he work there with his kind of attitude towards paying customers like myself? I simply asked for separate bags for 3 dinner plates I ordered.
He reluctantly separated the orders. I also asked for additional condiments & denied every request and simply walked away. How unprofessional & rude. Perhaps he should find a different job where he can mistreat customers freely. Food is good, but service is as important. Waba Grill 3028 N Broadway L.A. CA 90031 9:22pm.<//review></record>

My daughter literally spit out a screw from her mouth. I told the employee what was inside my daughters mouth. He acknowledged that it was a screw from a push broom that gets used to clean the grill. He showed me how it was coming apart and management was well aware of this. A maintenence tool that they continue to use. He said there's was nothing he could do because his manager was gone for the day. He referred me to the survey on the receipt? No accountability whatsoever.<//Review>< Rate>

Employees are indifferent. Prices are the same but veggies + meat portions are the smallest I’ve ever received at Waba Grill. Beware that your bowl/plate will be mainly rice. They are stingy with the sauce too. Do yourself a favor and drive to a different location.< /review>

Great napping place. The chairs in the main auditorium are very, very comfortable, and are at a just good enough angle for optimal sleeping positions. My favorite sleeping positions are the quick head down or the Chair Bed. The desks are large enough if you'd like to try out the head on the Hand position. The floor is a little hard for sleeping but it's doable if you really try. Classrooms are great places to hide away and sleep. Only con is that it can get smelly if there's a lot of people.<//review>

<Review>Huge auditorium, host to most webcasted classes that a lot of people end up skipping throughout the semester. Most crowded during midterm and final season.  Recently renovated to improve ventilation. The AV equipment is great too.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80857c25d1ebc261:0x7ed2ddf1d6e6e61b<//gmap_id>< UserId.>

Largest lecture hall on campus with a central location, and a regular meeting place for the largest classes. Numerous general assignment classrooms on each floor of the perimeter. Close to Memorial Glade, Doe Library, Sather Gate.< /text>

I love this place. I hate that google maps can't understand where it is and stop putting it where the University Health Center is!! I'm tired of picking up my packages from 2222 Bancroft Way. Figure it out, google maps this is absurd.<//Text>

This is one of my favorite shopping stores. I always left my credit card behind and the sale associates are always friendly and help me out with it. They help out without my physical card so I just love it!
I dress from this store mostly and I'd recommend this store to everyone who appreciate style, color and good customer service!<//Text>

<response>None< /response><Name>Lauren Gatlin< /Name><review>I love shopping here in Spring and Summer, I love the bright and fresh feel of their clothing during those seasons. They have great clearance stuff but the store fitting room is disgusting! Both my sister and I have a love/hate relationship with this location (in Del Amo Mall), depending on who is working I guess... sometimes we go unacknowledged until we get to the register! The employees can be lazy and into their own conversations which is probably why the store is so filthy. This location also doesn't carry all of the styles featured (even the ones displayed in the store)...</review><rate>4</rate></record></dataset><record>

Subscribe to their email list and they send amazing coupons every now and then that you can use in store. They have decent selection but most of the clothes are for "mature" women. I usually stick to slacks and jackets since none of their tops look flattering on me.<//Review>< pictures>

I have gone 3 times and it's always the same problem. They never add the meat/beef. It feels like I go eat vegetarian food or something. I always order #9 which is a crunchwrap and a crunchy taco. But I only get the tortilla and lettuce and sour cream. I don't know what is going on. They need to step up their game.< /review>< Pics>

Considering that you have to have your food to go taco Bell was really good with the senior citizen discount and bringing the drink out to me since I carried the bag of food out.
This is the taco Bell in Brawley CA and they were very kind and courteous but; I do miss being able to sit down and eat my food while it is SOMEWHAT warm instead of driving all the way home and eating cold food.
That's why you get four stars instead of five.
(I know you have no control over customers NOT BEING able to sit down, inside to eat; I understand.)⁉️

MAYBE THE NEXT TIME 🤞<//text>

<Review>OKay, on the real this place be just like their sauce... FIRE!!! People complain saying that this ain't  authentic Mexican comida pero does it matter? I come here straight after a phat bowl and lemme tell you this establishment hits the spot on my momma. The value boxes always satisfy and on the rare occasion where I feel like a swamp Donkey afterwards it's usually because i've eaten too much. Taco Bell really be making Brawley a better place.

<text>Hi,
I was a guest at this mobile home park in April, and I got hurt staying as a guest. I ended up with a fractured
Elbow and I needed the home owners policy to get medical attention. I have had my elbow fractured in the home and the bedroom door broken as I fell against it. I have not gotten anywhere with this situation, I have a police report and 2 doctors confirming that I was hurt. I also have pictures of broken bedroom door and my arm in a cast. Since I have had no help I will be by to file a report with the police report, and doctors letter to this incident. I would appreciate attention to the matter and I know you have the home owners policy for guest getting hurt, I plan on using it for my medical bills pain and suffering, and I also have a personal injury lawyer to use if the mobile home park doesn’t cooperate. I will be by on Aug 5, in afternoon to formally put in the accident request. I hope you cooperate, the owners are ignoring this despite evidence it happened in the home, and this happened on  your property where my lawyer will hold you liable, if you don’t cooperate.
I’m never staying here again as I suffered a lot. I plan on doing a civil suit with the park and owners for damages after I see my lawyer. This didn’t have to happen had I received policy to get care, it covers guest who fall in the home resulting in injury, I still need an MRI plus  Physical Therapy.
I lost a job not being able to work due to being hurt in the park, I will be coming in office with pictures, reports, and police report for damages. This park is negligent in making sure people are cared for if they are hurt, I’m pressing charges on this incident of being hurt., I will be in touch, I’m remaining silent until I have everything from my lawyer and police to file.
You need to go around at night, when these things happen and people get hurt. Doing day supervision is not enough, and most accidents happen at night. My life has become difficult the last few months, with 2 of them in a cast. I suggest night patrol to break up parties, and people who shouldn’t be there and of course people yelling and causing problems with neighbors. I hope you at least cooperate since owners are ignoring this, and it won’t go away.
I give 1 star for poor security and getting hurt badly on your property. I’ll be in touch soon.
Please up the security before another person breaks a bone falling inside home, or outside with cars speeding over 15 miles a hour. I have been almost hit twice. This place needs to tighten things up.<//text>< Pics>

seriously. . .My family can't park on the street anymore. . the guest parking is a 10min walk from most peoples trailers, and there isn't a single tree over 10' tall in the park anymore. . . How'd you like to spend the rest of your days next to 200kV transmission lines?..</Text>

I've been here over a year now.  These old people are mean and nasty.  It's a click too.  Don't expect people to be friendly,  especially if you have a conservative political affiliation.   Oh,  there's a lot of rules, but only for certain people.   Especially minorities who have civil rights attorneys on speed dial.  Getting new management next month.   Not expecting any changes.< /text>

The rampant nepotism practiced by the management of the community makes this a hostile place to live. If ever you wanted to see the smallest amount of authority that could be abused, simply observe the management.<//review>

Nice Mani & Pedi. I'd would have preferred the massaging chair for the pedi. The manicure fill turned into a full set but it is thin acrylic and feels so comfortable. Quality work. I only got 3 small cuts from the file. It was a good experience on the whole.<//Text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Text>Been to this place twice and the first time, I had the owner do my nails and she did a fabulous job. They can’t do a whole lot of nail art so I had her put gems and they came out soooo pretty. Lots and lots of compliments! The second time I went on a Sunday and even with an appointment, it was busy. They took me on time. A man did my pedicure and he was absolutely horrid! I paid extra for foot pedicure and all the time he massaged my calves and not my feet. Finally I said I wanted a female tech doing my nails and the owner came and did the rest. She did a great job but I felt extremely rushed and didn’t get exactly what I wanted. Highly suggest people go during week day. Other than that, place is clean and prices seemed competitive.<//Text>< pics>

The chairs not only for nails, but also pedicures are extremely uncomfortable. They are fast, but the quality is not there. They charged me $10 to have one tip added to one nail. I did dip and they turned out extremely lumpy and uneven. It was not at all relaxing.< /Review>

I really like this business. Couple things they need to attend to, when someone makes an appointment for 3 people to have mani’s and pedi’s Use an appointment book. We all sat and waited for them to come in. Long enough that water was getting cold.
Also, removing gel or powder the dremel is too harsh. It got so hot. At least 5 times I had to pull my hand away. What happened to the old soak in remover?
I will still use them regardless. 😄<//text>

I was a walk-in and knew I wanted acrylics. I typically like short tips, but Gina the owner, suggested the ballerina tips which are long. LET ME TELL YOU: listen to Gina!!! They are amazing and I’m never going back to short tips!!! 💜💜💜💜</text>

<text>So I absolutely loved the set I received, but I broke a nail not even close to 24hrs after I got the set. Then 2 more less than a week later and a couple days after that I lost another two. Loved the art but the quality was terrible in my experience. And every nail broke so low it ripped my real nail and all broken nails caused me a lot of pain.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I have been going to Blue Polish off and on for a few years. I bring my son (7) for pedicures every few months as a little treat, and I regularly have my nails done. The service is great, clean salon, and very flexible with appointments if I need to change them. Also it’s so easy to book online! I recommend them to my friends and family and my own hair clients.</review>

My regular nail salon in San Rafael is closed due to the ongoing pandemic. I decided to try Blue Polish Nail Spa & am very satisfied. The young ladies working there were all very courteous and professional. Furthermore, they were very well protected and the premises were spotless.
I will definitely be using their services again & will gladly recommend 😊. Thank you ladies!<//review>

<Text>Sophie is my hero!!!  I had to find a new manicurist because mine retired.  Ladies.... as you know that can be beyond challenging!!!  I had gone to 4 salons each one worst than the last. Even though I read great reviews.  I was frustrated and about to give up. I made an appointment at Blue Polish on a suggestion from a friend.  The salon is beautiful, quiet calming and Serene. I was welcomed promptly seated immediately.  All the ladies are warm and sweet.  Extremely courteous!!!  Gold star for customer service .  My nails were done to absolute perfection! Sophie might as well have done them under a microscope because they're flawless!!!  Never going anywhere else.... thanks ladies<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1581951795285, 'text': 'You are very welcome here. Putting a smile on your face is our job.

Lady was rude from the beginning. Seemed like she was in a rush, was aggressive and to top it off I had my finger cut. Not worth the value. I'll be taking my money else where.</Text>

This place was great! The nails were very pretty. They make sure that all of your nails are even and the same size. They also make sure that your nails are as perfect as possible. The ladies are very nice, and they ask you if you are liking your nails so far to make sure you get what you want. They do acrylics for adults and kids! The nails here have a good price point.  They aren’t too expensive. I would HIGHLY recommend you to come and get your nails done at this very nice place!< /Review>

Best nail salon in Santa Rosa. I kept trying to find a nail place that I love. I've gone to at least 5 different salons in town over the course of 3 years and I FINALLY found my favorite spot. The girls are nice and they don't talk bad about people which is rare for nail salon. Refreshing! They are quick & efficient without cutting corners. I won't go anywhere else as long as they keep up the good work and excellent customer service!<//review>

< review>
The first time I came, a few months ago, I was impressed with the quality of service there.  The regular pedicure, massage of feet and hot stones were really nice, and I've been really wanting to come back.  Finally after this stressful month of a friends painful death to cancer, and then the PG&E fire emergency I decided I deserved a treat. I came back, and looking at your menu decided I'd treat myself to the more deluxe, $42 Pedacure. Another client had come in same time as me sitting next to me. I watched in Envy as she got a really nice foot massage, as I'd been hoping for. I asked what kind of pediatrician she got and she said just the regular, commenting on how "great" a regular pedicure she was getting.  I thought well, that must be coming since what I'm paying for includes all regular + more.  But no, she kept rubbing my legs. I tried to let her know I wanted more foot massage but she just smiled because she barely speaks English. Then she painted toes which were fine but not my goal mid fall compared with getting a foot treatment. When I complained at pay time, they tried to argue then agreed to reduce to $35 which was still more than regular and I just accepted not wanting to make a big scene.  They said, " oh next time I give a different lady".  Well, we'll see if there's a next time.< /review>

Terrible. Not what I asked for at all. The tech looked at the picture I showed once, for less than 5 seconds and did what she wanted. When I tried to tell her she said she wasn’t done and that it would be fine. She was filing my mail so hard that she broke it and had to restart. Over all terrible not coming back.<//review>

Felt like a cattle call and my mani-pedi was rushed and done poorly. I originally booked online and selected the services I wanted after carefully considering the options. When I arrived though they didn't even look at what I had selected online when I told them I couldn't remember. The lady (I'm assuming owner) rushed me to make a decision rather than talk me through the options. She told me to go select a color but didn't tell me where to find the colors so I wandered until another lady yelled at me that the colors were in the other room. I had two ladies doing my hands and feet at the same time who barely spoke English. They both left air bubbles in my polish, blank spaces on the edges of my nails, and left jagged, uneven coloring. Two stars because they at least didn't cut me. The place is gorgeous but the service was so bad that I will not be back.<//review>

<text>Love this little nail salon. The girls are all very nice and they give a really great pedicure. The orange slices for the leg massage is a great touch and makes the room smell Amazing.

There have been a couple times where my manicure has turned out with a bubble here and there or peeled faster than other times, but that happens most places I've been to.

I keep coming back because the atmosphere, people and prices are great.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>Going into Blue Polish Nail Spa is like going home. I’m a regular and the women know me. Gina, the owner/manager, is a real sweetie and she keeps things moving along. The atmosphere is usually serene. I try for quiet times and quiet corners. Lisa is my regular nail technician and we have developed a very friendly relationship. She gives great leg massages and pays attention to my needs. I can’t say enough great things about this place.

Now with COVID19, Gina and all are working very hard to keep us safe. Today I had a pedicure. We were both masked with a plexiglass barrier in between. It was so good to see Gina again. It seems like years have passed since I last saw her. Bea gave me a wonderful pedicure. A nice escape from all the craziness of the world. Five stars!!!< /Text><UserId.>108630393367613265990<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

The best manicure and pedicure I have ever had, and that's saying a lot since I have been getting them for over 30 years.   I was in Santa Rosa visiting family and stopped in at blue nail spa.  The service was exceptional, and the foot and hand massages were the best.  Wish I lived here so I could make this my go to nail salon.<//text>

I've been going somewhere else for a long time and have heard great things about this place, so I decided to try it.  It has a more upscale look and feel to it and I like that it has a more spa like feel, then the typical rushed feeling I get at most nail salons.  My gel pedicure was in the copper bowl with a sanitary liner and was amazing.  When I asked them to shorten my nails more, they did without hesitation, unlike my last nail place, which ignored my request. The massage, products and artwork I requested on my nails were done tastefully and even after all that, the price was cheaper than the place I used to go to...notice I said used to.  I love that I felt pampered and didn't have to pay a fortune!</Text>

I love how how they took their time on my pedicure. I have ingrown toenails and they really took their time and were careful. Amazing atmosphere and super relaxing. My daughter got the kids mani/pedi and I like how they took their time and didn't rush through just because shes a kid they treated her as they would any adult. We will definitely be coming back!!!!!<//Text>

My nails were all completely different sizes. One hand had longer nails than the other and some are skinnier than the others and they got the color wrong. They even buffed my actual nail and burned me! Worst experience EVER !<//Review>

Tori did an AMAZING job on my pedicure. I had ingrown toenails on both of my big toes and she gently took care of them. Even though that was time consuming, she still gave me an amazing leg & foot rub. The polish was beautifully applied as well.<//review>

I found this treasure about 6 months ago. Have brought my sisters, daughter and elderly mother and we are all thrilled.  The ambiance is lovely, peaceful, and clean. The ladies are friendly, kind and skilled. They use individual and sterilized utensils and i especially love the copper foot bathes and hot stone massage. 💝💝💝💝💝< /review>

Busy! With my appointment it took close to 40 mins before sitting in a chair. Im sure do to the mother day week approaching.

Quality of work 100% the best.

Nails done May 10, 2019.

Guess what my nails look natural. No fill needed and its close to one month. The gel used on my nails matched my nails. Essentially, the $70 was well worth the price.<//text><GmapID>0x808447fef681d06d:0x59f7882cfdff759< /GmapID>< userid>

<text>I literally I’m so flabbergasted...I just came into this place and I was so wowed at how nice the place was . But little did I know how horrible the service was. I walked in and asked if they take walk ins . Dude said yes so I was like ok sounds good I checked in, sat at the chair I was suppose to then she came to me and said show me a picture of what you would like I showed her literally the most simplest nail set ever which was coffin nude nails with just 2 pink lines on the sides. She said ok sounds good ! I was like ok wow she is really getting to work everything was fine while putting on my tips until she started doing white and pink ombré. I’m not gonna lie the white and pink looked cute but it’s not what i wanted so I told her NICELY that i liked the colors but that’s not what i wanted. I wanted nude nails. She then slammed her hand on the table let out a big grunt then said fine I’ll take it off. She started talking about me in Vietnamese. Little did she know I’m half Vietnamese and I understand . I said nicely that i was just going to go to another place and said thanks for everything. She then pulled my hand again towards her and said no she was going to change it . I said nope it’s fine ill be leaving. I’m not a rude person I always let the nail tech finish what there doing becuz in the end I always love it but it had only been one nail and it was nice but not what I wanted . I wasn’t going to waste her time and make her do all of them then take them off I would never. But sometimes people need to treat people with the decency of respect.</text>< Pics>

<user>105019108817624975951<//user><text>This was our FIRST TIME coming to Blue polish, Due to the fact that my girlfriends original nail salon had already been book . She ended up going in as a walk-in , it was fine at first intill LITERALLY not even  10min the lady who started doing my girls nails Got mad because my girlfriend corrected her ( like anybody else would if. they saw somthing they did not ask for nor want ) she ask for NUDE color nails and lady was doing pink ombre on her ( like okayy so we're  just going to ignore what the client wants? Lol)  my girlfriend than has said in a polite way " i like the color you are doing but thats not what i wanted " the nail lady than slam her hand against the table and let out a "urgh" remark ( like as if it was too much to just start over , OH BTW!  its 1 nail you guys this isnt even a full hand yet nor the 2nd finger yet!!) So my girl than was like in a nice way " it's alright i'll go somewhere else thank you though "  than she yank my gf had and was like "no" ( i was sitting on the bench inside where the window is and seen this with my own 2 eyes i was shook , shook means upset or piss if you didn't know ) she than let her finish taking of the acrylic on her finger and when she finshed my girl said "its fine im going somewhere else " the nail salon lady was acting all nice because she felt or knew she lost a client. (and this day would come that im writing this review.) She than had the nerve this is the best part SHE HAD THE NERVE ( IF YOU ARE READING THIS YOU HAD THE NERVE! and must really think not everyone speaks  vietnames or is vietnames) to talk mess about my girl in Vietnamies to her employees ! But little did she know my Gf is HALF VIETNAMIES!! So she knew your whole convo and umderstood you. ( lesson is dont judge or assume people dont understand  you just cause they don't look a certain way smh  ) We than left unsatisfied mostly my gf because she had never been disrespect like that in anyway! ... But we than went to Today's Nails in Santa Rosa (its my girls original spot plus it down the street from blue polish)  to see if they could get her in ( we figure some people had cancel so it didnt hurt to try to seenin person ) because she really wanted her nails done . and AS ALWAYS. Todays nails never fails her after my gf explain to her nail salon lady what happen she told her " I'll get you hun she should have never treated you like that dont worry you'll be my last client for the day , i got you " End of the story is my girl got her nails done ! And they look PERFECT !  for the right price an Blue polish lost a client. So if you ever have a incident like this...

GO TO TODAY'S NAILS !!! IN SANTA ROSA ! THEY ARE ALL AMAZING!  TODAY'S Nails Is the place they make you feel welcome and arnt akward !</text></record>

Best pedicure and manicure routine ive ever had! They use an amazing scrub for your legs and a super smooth moisturizer for your hands and they rub them both with these hot stones!! Ugh i'm never going anywhere else! Best part is they aren't any more expensive than any other parlor! Not to mention it beautiful inside.< /Review>

We go here and feel the price is good. Each time we’ve been in they ask what we want, I tell them (I’m usually with my daughter) and they come back and ask again, and again. Usually they’ve asked 5+ times before we are done. Pretty annoying.</review>

<time>1550105413563< /time><Rate>1< /Rate><text>So I went and got acrylics done. So the lady who was doing my nail of course asked “ how long do you want your nails”? I said long. So she shows me before she cuts the nail and I said no longer. She said “ no you don’t want them that long and straight cut it. Like wow. I’m PAYING you. I don’t care what your opinion is. Then also the nails were bumpy and she did them so fast and didn’t take her time. One was sideways. I literally paid 50$ well 48$ for some s**t. Also she didn’t fix under the nails so it’s very sharp and all messed up. Id never go again.

And now they literally broke off like they are some Walmart glue on nails......< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

This is the worst service I think I’ve ever had at any nail salon. I was there for a full set and pedicure and my pedi was great, my nails not so much. I wanted my nails on the long ish side and even though when she asked me if the length was good and I said I’d like it shorter, she ignored it and left them wayyy too long. Then after applying the Acrylic powder, she just disappeared for 20 minutes whiteout finishing my nails. I had to leave because I had work in 30 minutes. If I knew it was going to take me 3 hours to do get my nails and toes done I would have never gone. So now I am left with non finished nails and I had to pay full price. I highly recommend trying a different place. Horrible costumer service<//text>

This was the worst leg wax I have ever had in my life. They were extremely rude the minute I arrived. The girl who waxed me had obviously never (a) waxed anyone before or (b) even been for a wax herself. She got wax everywhere except my legs (including my tshirt, even though it was a half leg wax); she missed whole swathes of hair so that I basically need another wax and she burnt me. It really couldn't have gone much worse. DO NOT GO HERE!!</Review>

<review>Horrible service. I believe the manager was the one who did my nails. She was on the phone the whole time, would leave me every 5 mins, I asked her to fix one of my nails and told me to shut up! She left them all crooked and bumpy. Now I have to go to a different salon to fix them. Don’t recommend this place.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><time>1531770821820< /time>< Gmap_id>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I'm happy to say Shake Shack more than redeemed themselves from yesterday's visit. I had an issue with an undercooked burger. When I called and got assistance from the manager, Jasmine, it didn't seem like the incident was much concern for them or how it inconvenienced me. Well today I went back as directed and instead of getting a refund, I opted to give them another try, since that was just my 2nd visit (the day of the incident). Jasmine went above and beyond to make sure everything was good and that I was happy. She comped my meal additions and gave me coupons to use for a future visit. She was very apologetic and topped it off with a smile. Thanks Jasmine and Shake Shack! That's how you do service, and honestly u did more than I would've expected. I'll definitely BE BACK!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

- Cheese burger 4/5
- Chips 3/5
- Service 4/5
If you haven’t tried Shake Shack.... you have to!
There is a little debate on whether it’s better than In & out burger and I think it is.</Text>

<gmapID>0x80c2bf38efe42137:0xf899bef543ef3d70<//gmapID><Review>First I must say I'm a big fan of Shake Shack. Love the quality of the meat and that the meat isn't hidden by too many "accessories" like lettuce tomatoes etc.  That said, I went for "curbside delivery". at this location, which involves going into a parking garage and waiting at a specified set of spaces.  What I didn't expect was to have to pay $20 to exit the garage, especially on a holiday at 8pm!!  Shake shack is great but do NOT opt for "deliver to your car" at this location.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< date>

My family and I just love Shake Shack!  The Montrachet goat cheese and pesto aioli sandwich is to die for.  Sooooo tasty.  The curried chicken salad sandwich with walnuts and cranberries on house made cranberry walnut bread is delicious as well. Our kids ordered the three cheese grilled cheese sandwiches and raved about them. The soups were good too.  The portions are generous, the prices are reasonable and the food is delicious.  This is not fast food, and the cafe is cute but small with limited staff (just the two owners), but good things come to those who wait.  One of the owners, Gerard, bakes and sells the most wonderful breads and pastries at the Montrose Farmers Market. We have enjoyed his baked goods for many years, and we were very excited to hear he opened a cafe right in La Crescenta. Gerard is the nicest man.  And his cafe is lovely and sweet, just like the owner!  Looking forward to becoming regulars at Shake Shack.</review>

<Name>Nars Khenchil</Name><Date>1620867194572</Date><rate>1</rate><text>Very bad customer service. I ordered pickup through Doordash and I always do so at this location. Upon arrival, I wasn’t greeted and stood there waiting for someone to acknowledge me. The young man who was working pick up at around 5:30 PM on 5/12 told me I was at the “wrong place” and that the address for Shake Shack isn’t on Hollywood BLVD- as my app had shown. I have ordered pick up from here multiple times, I am aware of the address. He claimed my order wasn’t there and I had pointed to it before because I saw it on the shelf and he said “Oh you said postmates not Doordash”. Please do not blame customers if you cannot pay attention and listen properly. The attitude I received from him was totally unnecessary and I won’t be coming back to this location- it’s not hard to have good manners and pay attention to what customers are saying. I understand it can get busy but this is not an excuse to treat people this way. So disappointing!<//text>< pictures>

The Lyft driver suggested I try this restaurant because I had a taste for a good burger. The service was excellent from the young man that took my order. The service took awhile, but you can’t expect it to be fast because it is located on Hollywood Boulevard. The food tasted great, the burger had awesome flavor, and everything was hotbed fresh (which is always impressive when it’s at a burger spot). I had a single burger add bacon with fries.< /Text>

<text>Excellent food, covid 19 compliant with outdoor seating. One negative is I never heard them call my name as they called it from the same window as I ordered from. I was told they were going to call my name near the outdoor guest seating.<//text>< rate>

Horrible organized place. We were waiting almost one hour to take out our order. But the worst part is the food wasn’t even tasty.
We got chicken sandwiches and French fries. Everything was so dry!!!! 😖
The best Shake Shack is in Marina del Rey!!< /text>

Chicken bite is average.

Looked up under Happy Hour.....so glad I did. Nice big place, immediately got a seat and ordered. I will say that parking can be a challenge. Lot small in comparison to the restaurant  That being said its worth the hunt for parking. Very friendly staff and food arrives quickly. Order the Mac and cheese, you won't be disappointed< /Text>

Shake Shack is a pretty decent burger joint, despite coming from the East coast. The cheese fries are probably their best, while the burgers themselves can be a little salty. If you're looking for the quintessential California burger look elsewhere, like In-n-Out for example. They do offer ice cream mixes for dessert. This store is steps away from Hollywood and Vine Red Line Station so easy access. Tourists abound here.</text>

<review>BEST FAST FOOD BURGER CHAIN EVER! Shake shack burgers are the best! The soft potato bun and the fresh tomatoes and lettuce with the classic American cheese all work together to create a flavor exposition. While paired with the curly fries tops it off, it has a crunchy outer layer and a soft middle is just what you want. Although it is more expensive than In&Out it's worth the extra money.<//review><gmapID>0x80c2bf38efe42137:0xf899bef543ef3d70</gmapID>< username>

Great selection of burgers salads and dogs. Priced fair, great flavor. Convenient location,  lot's of parking.
One thing they don't do is ask how you want your meat cooked. I prefer medium, mine was more medium well.  Onion rings are crunchy without being over cooked. Casual place with beer and wine selection.<//Text>

<Text>Considering Covid conditions and crazy atmosphere on election night with so many extra security measures and surrounding businesses boarding up their windows, the atmosphere seemed calm. The wait was understandable and lines to wait and order easily managed. The wait was a bit longer for me since I ordered on site versus internet or app orders and so many food delivery companies going to the head of the line. I missed lunch so this highly caloric meal was a well deserved treat.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1604578512276, 'text': 'Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

True, I went on a high traffic day - SATURDAY- and in the summer- but there were so many frustrated people looking for seats that this was definitely impacting the dining experience of everyone else lucky enough to have a seat. In the 30 minutes we were there, we were aoproached 3 times by people asking us if  "we are leaving soon". Several other people were just scanning all of the tables waiting to grab a table the second someone left.  The food is reasonably priced. We ordered Classic Cheese burgers $5.79  but they are small and don't come with frys. Burgers were quite tasty. They also have a free self service water station with small plastic cups so you can have all the free water you want. When you order, you are given a buzzerthat vibrates when it's time to pick up your food - a GREAT feature with such a crowded place.  Restrooms are only accessible with the password at bottom of receipt and are very small for all of the customers. There is seating outside and inside. Overall, I think this would be a great place to try on a weekday, but unless you are willinh to wait and fight for a table ,I would not recommend  visiting on a weekend summer day.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeQPkpQBfRanlXnXG6OfNH_72arQYj9tBJZGBf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPreRffG9ActkfZKCVjbINrxzMKmfxbVu6UXW8T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c2bf38efe42137:0xf899bef543ef3d70< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great burgers, and even better milkshakes. Staff is friendly, and it's well worth a visit. It's not the cheapest place, but as this place is trendy they can get those extra Dollars from their customers. The milkshakes are great, but the cups are ridiculously small. I want bigger cups – think big gulp!<//Text>

Their burgers are juicy and tasty and their onion rings are fries are delicious. Great place to eat in San Francisco! The workers are also very friendly.

The place is not that big and only seats about ten.<//text>

BEST FAST FOOD BURGER CHAIN EVER! Shake shack burgers are the best! The soft potato bun and the fresh tomatoes and lettuce with the classic American cheese all work together to create a flavor exposition. While paired with the curly fries tops it off, it has a crunchy outer layer and a soft middle is just what you want. Although it is more expensive than In&Out it's worth the extra money.< /text>

<Review>This is one of my go-to spots to get a quick pre-show meal before catching a musical at the Hollywood Pantages Theatre. In addition to their delicious burgers, shakes, and crinkle-cut fries, they also serve hot dogs, frozen custard, beer, and wine. Their prices are somewhat higher than other fast food places, but that's because they use 100% all-natural Angus beef with no hormones or antibiotics used. You can definitely taste the difference! I almost always order their Double ShackBurger which is a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce.< /Review>< pics>

<text>Great selection of burgers salads and dogs. Priced fair, great flavor. Convenient location,  lot's of parking.
One thing they don't do is ask how you want your meat cooked. I prefer medium, mine was more medium well.  Onion rings are crunchy without being over cooked. Casual place with beer and wine selection.< /text><user_id>106812886691791247610</user_id></record>

My first time trying this place and they really have good burgers and shakes. I can see the hype. Burgers were super juicy and delicious, the shakes perfectly milky and sweet and the service was pretty good too. It's pricey though but with food that good, it's worth it.< /Text>

Have been eating at shake shack since it was only in NYC! Always been a fan. I always get the Smokeshack because it has hot cherry peppers, which I love, and perfect for anybody who loves spicy. Can’t go wrong with crinkle cut fries and Their shakes are amazing too!<//text>

The parking is 2-hour free with validation (make sure you put the validation ticket first before the original ticket). The burgers, fries, and shakes were good. I was able to eat right outside in the outdoor seating. Overall, good experience.<//text>

<Review>I've eaten at Shake Shack a few times over the past few weeks. The first time I had the chicken sandwich which was superb and today I had the chicken nuggets which were also superb. I'm not a fan of meaty crinkly cut fries, but there's are perfectly well done and crunchy. Oh the honey mustard is really good also.< /Review><name>Mitchell Wapner<//name><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

<review>We loved the food! This was our first time. The employees were very welcoming.  The food was superb.  The French fries were perfectly cooked and salted.  The burger was delicious. The Chocolate Peppermint shake was also delicious... very minty and refreshing,  not too sweet.  Thank you<//review>< rating>

<Name>kalin hayashi<//Name><time>1583706343049<//time><Rate>4<//Rate><text>I have addiction to Shake Shack.  Haters beware, this is a biased review.  Shake shack has become my go to place when I’m traveling to other cities and I start missing home.  That being said, there’s no Shake Shack in my neighborhood so I’m not sure how that became to be. Nonetheless it’s my go to spot for my favorite crinkle fries frozen custard sundae.  If you’re like me and carry around pocket spices, this is the time to pull out some cinnamon. Sweet potato pie sundae. It’s amazing.  I also like their fried chicken sandwich. Makes me forget about the Uber popular fast food joints with Mediocre fried chicken sandwiches. Some which come with a side of hate.  This location gets quite crowded being in the center of tourist town.  The restroom can get quite dirty at times.  There’s parking everywhere but be prepared to pay a lot if you can’t find meters because garage parking is expensive. More than your burger at least.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Shake Shack is very well known for its delicious shackburgers, shakes and concrete. Today I tried the chick’n bites and I was impressed by the way they were freshly cooked and tasted which is far better that any tenders or nuggets I have previously had from other restaurants.< /Text>

<review>The burger here is ridiculously good. Thick, juicy, flavorful and smashed into a inch of it's life. Yeah, the burger a bit salty (and a tad expensive) but it's one tasty treat. A word to the wise: Avoid the boring crinkle cut fries (instead, spend your cash on an extra Patty for your burger). Service at this location is a bit slow (no matter the time of  the day) but it is what it is.<//review>< Pics>

First time there and really pleased with their menu and environment. Tried their classic burger and fries with a white mocha milkshake.

Burger was smaller than I thought but very pleased with the size of the patty.

Good for a quick bite with friends or to watch a game with their TV's.< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I didn't really have any expectations walking into this place. I thought... Yep just another burger joint in the US. I was so wrong... Taking that first bite, it stunned me and took me back in time to when I first had a hamburger. This brought a flood of memories, of times where I had great food. People rave about in 'n' out but honestly, shake shack absolutely smashes it.

4 stars for an amazing burger. 1 star for chips that were crunchy. Why do you yanks on the west coast love soggy chips?< /Text></record>

Nice location with friendly service. Shake shack always has great burgers. The service is what made this location stand out. I ordered a lettuce burger and asked to be noted for egg allergy. So no sauce. When the burger came out, I could see there was cross contamination from the sauce. I mentioned it to the employees and they happily took care of it and made it right. They even apologize for the inconvenience. Great job doing the right thing and taking care of the customer.< /review>

<review>If you're looking for a tasty burger in a hurry the "Shake Shack" is the perfect place for you. Being an out of towner, this was my first time here. My order was taken with patience and a smile. The prices are reasonably and they offer inside and outside seating. If I'm ever in the area again I will be back.</review>< UserId.>

<review>The burgers are smaller than In N' Out, but are much better! Be sure to have the bacon cheddar fries and a concrete (shake). If you are over 21, try the Shakemeister beer! My favorite burger is the Roadside Double, which is a double Swiss cheese burger with beer battered onions and bacon.</review>< date>

Yummy yum yum yum. This is a very nice location. The interior is nice and clean and the staff are courteous and attentive. The patio is nice and has a decent atmosphere and is decently.screen from street noise. As for Shake Shack itself, if you haven't had it and you enjoy burgers you owe it to yourself to give it a try.< /review>

While out with the family and after visiting the Funko Store we walked into The Shake Shack for dinner. Always such good food. I would have given it 5 stars but the cashier was a tad rude, I don't think he wanted to be there. Nevertheless, the food was bomb!<//Review>

The Service: Excellent service. The manager was checking with customers if everything was okay. When he saw dirty trays on table, he helped to clean up too.

The Food: The burger was just okay. The advertised photos look much better than the real one. The buns looked smashed a bit, not too appetizing. However, the fries were delicious.

The Parking: Parking structure with validation< /text>

<Text>Pretty delicious as far as food is concerned.  Actually all the credit to the food, and none to the service.  My buzzer didn't work and they said they called but they weren't calling anyone.  You could tell the service could care less. You could also see the workers in the back chatting and on their phones.  Really sucks to see that they just didn't seem to care.< /Text><name>Marianne Marquez< /name><rate>4< /rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< userid>

<Review>Loved the ambience. Nice heaters outside to give nice warm and cool feeling all together. Very nice cozy place. Loved shroom burgers. One of mine than enough for over person. You must try it. All of their shakes are super great. I tried strawberry . It was perfect. Think and good quantity to fill your empty stomach.</Review>< Gmap_id>

Shake Shack is easily the best chain burger joint you can visit.  I like all the high quality burger places, but this has become my favorite.  We first encountered it in Vegas at NY, NY, then we traveled to New York and tried the one in Brooklyn, then they finally opened one in Cali.  Amazing place.  Don't hold back, pig out.  Shack burger with the giant cheese filled mushroom, large fries, and a 32 oz. beer for me every time.< /text>

Some burgers at other places are loaded with ingredients that can make the main focus drift away from the actual beef. This place is the exact opposite of that. At Shake Shack, the meat is the star. The Angus beef just  has so much flavor that makes it almost irresistible, and the vegetables only compliment the flavor. Perfect portion size. Burgers are a little pricier than most fast food places, but the food is so delicious that it most definitely will be worth your time.</text>

I love the food, but almost every time I come they buzz me too early. My buzzer rings and I go up to the counter, and my food isn't there. Then I have to wait another minute or two for my food. Buzz me when the food is actually ready!!<//Review>

They have WINE! And juicy, succulent tasty food. Good for families. Can get crowded yet this is one of the non-vegan, carb friendly, fill yo belly an feel good type places in Hollywood. The people who work there are very friendly and cheerful. Outdoor seating as well.< /Text>

Extremely juicy meat, with an awesome crust that adds an extra layer of flavour and texture.
The standard burger with meat cheese and sauce is just perfect.
The fries are also amazing, and the fact that they have their own beer produced by Brooklyn shows a lot how amazing this place is.</Review>< gmap_id>

I don’t usually write reviews when I’m eating out at regular places, but now I have to. It’s shake shack, burgers are great, shakes are amazing. Consistent everywhere.

But now, at this particular branch, while I was in line, there was an Asian tourist who was being served by a staff named Allison (her name was on my receipt). Understandably, the Asian tourist had trouble communicating her orders to Allison. She tried her best to let Allison know what she wanted by pointing out on the menu. Allison however was being so rude and rolling her eyes, speaking to the tourist in the most horrible way. Not only that, but she had the nerves to actually talk about the Asian tourist to her colleague right in front of her.

Now Allison, this is a message for you and I hope you read it.
Don’t work in a tourist hotspot if you can’t handle tourists. Don’t work in hospitality if you can handle people. Don’t work anywhere because your attitude is terrible. Now you should also know that I have a video of you being horrible to that customer. Obviously I’m not going to post it anywhere now but I hope your managers do something about you.< /Text>

Shake Shack is a pretty decent burger joint, despite coming from the East coast. The cheese fries are probably their best, while the burgers themselves can be a little salty. If you're looking for the quintessential California burger look elsewhere, like In-n-Out for example. They do offer ice cream mixes for dessert. This store is steps away from Hollywood and Vine Red Line Station so easy access. Tourists abound here.<//text>

I heard about this place from people and media so I was excited to try it and was disappointed, arriving hungry I ordered the biggest burger on the menu  for about $10but I got a kids menu size burger, their potions are very small,and the fries is like those frozen ones you can but from the supermarket. The 2 stars us for the taste that wasn't so bad but still not worthy.</Text>

< review>
Great burgers. Had the smokeshack and a large lemonade. Really great burger, as expected. Have always heard the fries aren't great so I skipped them. Definitely didn't need them with the burger and drink though. Didn't take terribly long to get our food either. Indoor seating sucks. They put tables absolutely everywhere. In corners. Four inches from the exit. Seriously California. Stop putting a one and a half foot by one and a half foot table with two chairs that doesn't match any of the rest of your seating right by the door with only six inches of chair space. Just, don't put that table out, at all.

Outdoor seating is excellent, and there's plenty of it.<//review>

<text>I hate how good shake shack is because anytime I go in I’m sure to leave with an extra 1500-2000 calories added onto me but it’s honestly worth it. The burgers are great and the milkshakes are even better. I usually get half chocolate and half strawberry to get the best of both words. It’s usually pretty busy in here but they do an excellent job getting everyone served quickly and with a smile. I usually take my order to go but plenty of seating in here too if you’re eating in.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCFdefI_jzRZ8aCqbtvqvpwRY24d6jSSDN7YBJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

More like Shake Sh...you know what I mean. This place is just gross and disappointing. How does this even have a 4.3 star rating? The burgers taste like Hamburger Helper and Spam had a baby, and then the baby burger was cooked on a grill at an abandon park using old dirty clothes found nearby as your kindling. I don't know...maybe people like that? The only good thing at this place were the fries and soda. Also, the service was pretty fast considering they were slammed. I do not recommend. This place is over priced and not worth your money.<//text>

If you love a good burger with not too much grease this is the place to go. The shakes are even in a good size portion and very filling</Review>

The order takers aren't the most attentive (they didn't ring up multiple items we had ordered), but there's no denying that the food lives up to the hype. I enjoyed my burger the most. Cooked perfectly and well-seasoned  The fries were surprisingly really good and super crispy. The custard I ordered was pretty soupy (Culver's or Freddy's is better) and the cookie chunks were too big, but I still liked it.</Text>

<Text>Best burgers in LA. Period. No questions. I have tried the Shack Burger and the Smoke Shack. Both are amazing. Can't wait to eat there again before I fly out. The shakes are delicious too. Make sure you try a Shake Shack if you have never before and you will be pleasantly surprised. A little on the expensive side as they do not do combos and each item has to be ordered separately. However the taste justifies the price.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I love the shack shack! Best burgers, cheese fries, and shakes ever! This place is always crowded but they are well staffed and keep the line moving. The only problem is that the seating area is woefully inadequate. It is hard to find a place to sit! Get your food to go and then try to find a place to sit on one of the planter areas outside. The Pantages theatre is only a block away so stop by if you are headed to an event. I am getting hungry just thinking about the great food. Give it a try! As always your mileage may vary.< /review>

So many options! Packed but lots of places to sit inside & out. Would have loved a veggie burger option other than mushroom, but I love just the fries and shakes. Would love to try the ice cream and floats. Quick service and delicious mustard and ketchup. Bring shake shack to Australia!< /Review>

The burgers and fries are awesome! The lines can be long, but the fast service makes up for it. It is conveniently located near Pantages on Hollywood Blvd. It has a nice outdoor patio that is heated and indoor seating as well. I also like the regular lemonade. The restaurant has alcoholic beverages for those who like to have a drink with their burger. They also have shakes and desserts.< /Text>

Surprisingly good. I loved the shake but the concrete was a little too sweet. Cheese fries are lame. Just go for the shakes and burgers. If you are avoiding gluten, you can get your burger wrapped in lettuce just like In and Outs protein style. It's pricier than In and out but 100% angus patties must cost more.< /text>

<review>My friends made me drive across LA to get this. To be honest it’s pretty great, the store is efficiently laid out also so it’s fast.

Burger is comparable to in and out.</review>< user>

Shakes are good but the people should be fired we waited 20 minutes for three shakes and the workers were very rude, one of the workers started yelling at a customer and the people after us got there shakes and food, and people were complaining also the buzzers that tell you when your order is done they didn’t go off. Get new workers!<//text>

<Review>The burgers and fries are great. Plenty of seating outside and inside. The service is also nice and fast. The only reason I won't give this place 5 stars is because of the location. I wouldn't come here unless i was already planning to be in Hollywood. If you are on the strip, definitely swing by here.</Review>< Pictures>

I absolutely love peanut butter and when I found out that I could put peanut butter on my burger I knew it was something I had to do. I got the bacon burger and peanut butter on the side and this combination had me head over heels!!! This meal was so damn good I need to go back and have it again very soon!< /Text>

The bacon cheddar stack is amazing with the white garlic cheese sauce & bacon. I also add a deep fried portabello mushroom too it. The burgers aren't big but they are fulfilling. The white cheddar bacon fries are to die for. And if you have a sweet tooth, try the Black Forest Shake. They also have really good iced tea!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Burger is fine. But a bit overpriced.  Fries is good but recommend without cheese sauce if you are not big fan of cheese. Compare to in n out. I will recommend in n out.<//text>

We also ordered 10 pieces of chicken nuggets and they gave us 8 nasty, over-cooked pieces with an awful taste to them. Gross. The lemonade is supposedly fresh but tastes like Country Time. One of my worst dining experiences in years. No one in my party was happy. I truly don't get why people like it. Yuck. Still starving after spending a ton of money. Have to go get more food.

I was really disappointed with the burger... it was just... flat out gross. The fries were good and there mango coconut shake was amazing.... but I'd only go back for the drink.</Review>

< Review>
It started out a little strange - it was fairly late, there was a long line. My friend and I had only been there a few minutes when a few guys burst in dressed like superheroes and began to roughhouse quite dramatically like a bunch of little children. Not sure if they were trying to capture something on video but it was just a silly mess really. An employee for come out and tell them off (they jumped on the counter). They left after that.

It was uneventful after! I ordered my food and it was made quite quickly (cheese fries and a chocolate malt). Someone came around to check on us as well. Never a dull moment at Shake Shack!< /Review>

<review>I thought the whole overall experience was going to be better. I waited in a 10 minute + line for a sub-par burger. Nothing special, the fries even sucked pretty badly. Not a fan, im not sure why they have gotten so big, maybe due to the shakes and the deserts</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I loved this place!! The bbq burger was delicious and so was the peanut butter custard! The line was really long which almost deterred me but I decided to stay and it actually went through pretty fast. The staff was incredibly efficient and thorough which added to the pleasant experience. I highly recommend!<//review>

<Review>Located on Hollywood boulevard, it is a wonderful place to get burgers and shakes.  The service is pretty fast and there is always enough seating both inside and outside. The only problem is parking.<//Review>< Name>

I love the ambiance of this place, but the burger (or at least the Shack Burger) was nothing to write home about. I did like the fact that the bun was cut in a way so that the ingredients wouldn't fall out the other side.

As for the taste, it was fresh and fatty. The single patty was enough to keep me satisfied, but I can imagine making a poor decision in the future and ordering the double.

I'll give it a three stars for now, but I can imagine that might bump up to 4 (or more) in the future when I try some of their other offerings.< /Text>

<Review>The burger was a very good simple burger. It was really nice to have a restaurant do the basics so well. The shake was also great, which is to be expected from a place named for them. The fries were just okay (I'm sure they would have been great with cheese and bacon). The place was packed so there really wasn't anywhere to sit but there are benches outside if you don't mind eating without a table.</Review>< name>

I wanted to not like the burgers because it's a little pricey for a fast food burger joint, but it's worth every penny.  Burgers are a little charred and it really puts them above the rest around.</Text>

There was a fairly long line, but they're really quick, so we didn't have to wait long. Friendly service, great burgers. It was clean, and inviting environment. It was a little tough finding a table, but we grabbed a table before our food was ready, so no problem.</Review>

I must admit, the burger is pretty good, but the fries....yikes. Refried fries, not worth the 3 dollar parking at all. If they provided 45 minutes free, maybe 3 stars for the combo. The price (12) for a single burger with fries and small fifty fifty  (lemonade/ice tea). I'll just go to in and out. I know their stuff is fresh and they don't charge for parking. And their service is way better, too.</text>

<Text>Shake Shack is a great place to grab a burger and a shake. My favorite item to order is the fried chicken sandwich. Their crinkle fries are also very good, and you have the option of adding cheddar and bacon to them. I take away one star because their food pickup system is slightly broken.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>The food was tasty. However, the food is a little over priced for what you are getting. The place itself is not large enough to hold all of their customers at busy times. When it's crowded, the workers also cannot handle the crowds and make a lot of mistakes.</review>< gmapID>

<text>Perhaps I'm biased, but Shake Shack can never let you down. The shacks they whip up are bar-none in flavor, thickness and style. Their chicken and beef burgers are cooked so well it's hard to believe it's a fast food restaurant. There isn't enough to say about this restaurant other than try it, and you'll see what I mean.</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I wasn’t impressed by their veggie burger, which was more like a deep fried exploding zit than a burger. I’m just saying.... 🤷🏽‍♂️

Burger King, fat burger, umami burger all have better veggie burgers than this place. The fries also are a letdown. I just don’t see what the hype is all about. The service was great, however.</review>

<review>Nothing special about this place - quite overpriced and tasted similar to the burger chain Freddy's (except Freddy's is like half the price)

They don't offer any combos, fries seem like the frozen ones you can buy at Target.

Drinks were pittiful. Take the Happy meal cup and then charge almost 3 bucks seemed to be the owners idea.

Overall a 1 and done never going back.

If you want an amazing burger in the same price range I would recommend Red Robin over this place any day.<//review>< Rate>

Hoa plane was flat out horrible.  Horrible customer service at the cashier.  And as they pulled the trash out the customers dining area with stinky trash. The pricing is super expensive for a burger with no condiments< /text>

<review>The food was tasty. However, the food is a little over priced for what you are getting. The place itself is not large enough to hold all of their customers at busy times. When it's crowded, the workers also cannot handle the crowds and make a lot of mistakes.<//review>< Time>

I am a huge fan of Shake Shack ever since I tried it at the NY location. However, this location does not meet the same standards.
My buzzer went off 4 times indicating the food was ready but each time I went up it wasn't my call. They also got my order wrong.
I'd still go to this location just because the food is still 5/5, but I'm hoping they become more organized for managing orders.< /text>

I ordered a Shack Burger today and it was the best decision of my life . These burgers are my absolute favorite and I knew I liked them but today this burger made my day . It was better than ever. I’ve tried many delicious burgers in my life but this one  is my absolute favorite one. The quality ,the  texture ,the  juiciness is just perfect . Plus I think the price is just right
I can’t get over these burgers . I think I’m gonna order one tomorrow again .
They are just amazing !
And the employees have been really nice every time I have gone .
I have only good things to say about Shake Shack . I even made a youtube video of how much I love these burgers lol< /review>

The hype is just that. My burger was VERY greasy and the fries were meh. I'm an In 'n Out fan, and these burgers don't compare.  The site is very clean, service is good because we the people do all the work and getting a drink refill is do-able but annoying. But the product itself, not great. My kid loves it, so there's that!</text>

<review>Hamburgers, hot dogs, Americana food. The cheese in the picture on the website is not what you get. Don't get me wrong, the burger was good, but not worth the price. Go for an In-N-Out burger instead. If you want something quick just before you in to the Pantages theatre, stop here and stuff your face on a small burger and fries slathered in imitation white yellowish cheese and pay an exaggerated price. Staff and crew are awesome, constantly asking if you need anything. For the amount if time they bother you whilst you got a mouth full of food, they should certainly bring it to you instead of me going over to the counter like I'm in a prison cafeteria line...</review>< user_name>

<text>It's pretty good, they're not just your normal burgers, however,  there are no combos so everything is paid for separately and the price of every single item it a bit much. I usually spend $20-25 on myself.</text>< pictures>

We always go here after seeing a show at the Pantages.  The service is consistently friendly and the food is always good.  I love that some of their menu items donate to a local charity and their partner with local small businesses for some of their menu items.<//Text>

Best french fries and shakes! So savory! If you need to use the bathroom, be prepared to purchase something in order to get the door code. It can be crowded, especially before a show.</text>

Five stars for the milkshake alone. Burger was quite good but the black and white milkshake was life-threateningly delicious. Like, insane.< /Text>

The hype is just that. My burger was VERY greasy and the fries were meh. I'm an In 'n Out fan, and these burgers don't compare.  The site is very clean, service is good because we the people do all the work and getting a drink refill is do-able but annoying. But the product itself, not great. My kid loves it, so there's that!</Review>

I ordered a Shack Burger today and it was the best decision of my life . These burgers are my absolute favorite and I knew I liked them but today this burger made my day . It was better than ever. I’ve tried many delicious burgers in my life but this one  is my absolute favorite one. The quality ,the  texture ,the  juiciness is just perfect . Plus I think the price is just right
I can’t get over these burgers . I think I’m gonna order one tomorrow again .
They are just amazing !
And the employees have been really nice every time I have gone .
I have only good things to say about Shake Shack . I even made a youtube video of how much I love these burgers lol< /review>

<Text>I always get the Shack Stack. You can't get it anywhere else. The line is not too bad compared to other Shake Shacks. However, it gets crowded with people waiting for a seat and they tend to hover nearby.

The area is clean and have both indoor and outdoor seating. Staff comes by and offers to take your tray for you and asks for feedback on your visit. Great stop before or after seeing a show at the Pantages Theater.<//Text>< Pics>

We tried the smokehouse today. The red peppers give it that extra time factor. My son saw a famouse YouTuber at This location. It was crowded, but ran efficiently. Parking is a hot mess. Good luck with that 😊 Quick walk from Hollywood/Vine metro station.</review>

Both the bacon cheese fries and the double burger made with a fried mushroom and meat patties are great!  Can get very crowded but line moves quickly at dinner. Good for a good tasting quick meal before a Pantages show.</review>

< Review>
I've visited this fairly large chain in Detroit, and this particular franchise in LA did nothing to change my mind. Based on my Detroit experience, I probably should have stayed away. I decided to give this one a go, because I was curious if locale would have anything to do with my decision about the Detroit, and maybe this one would be better. I guess the upshot of my whole experience is that the food at Shake Shack is really terrible taste why, and the high prices certainly are a kick in the toockus as well.<//Review>

<Review>Um, Shake Shack is not Nobu. When I arrive there at 12:30 on a Thursday for a quick bite, I am not expecting a Hollywood-style lockout for a "special event". Um, way to jump the shark, Shake Shack. I stay at the Intercontinental on Broadway in Manhattan all the time. You know, the one with the Shake Shack on the first floor, right? They've never locked me out for some BS celebrity event when I was hungry and just wanted a simple hamburger. Now I hate you. I'm boycotting both the Vine location and the Times Square location until such time as you get over yourself and get back to the simple business of serving hamburgers during posted hours of operation. I live in the Hollywood Hills, but I'm never coming here again. Over and out.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Text>The service was fast and friendly. But the cheeseburger itself had a weird aftertaste.  I took a few bites and I was done with it. The fries were good and the chili was ok. But the cheese on your fries is liquid nacho cheese. I know some people like that but I think its gross.  I didn't try the shakes so, I would go back to try that at least.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Out of cheeses, bacon & varoius other ingredients.  Service was really slow, especially  for not many people in restaurant. Got charged for items on burger that weren't  on it. Usually they are better.< /review>

<text>This is a burger joint, a Hollywood version of one, but a burger joint nevertheless. They offer hot dogs, burgers, shakes, coffee. It's a half-a-block from The Pantages Theater, so a good after-theater place. The shakes are custard not ice cream and actually really good, not so thick you can't drink them for an hour after you ordered one as with most ice cream shakes. The burgers are good, but this is not a gourmet burger place.  They didn't ask how we wanted ours cooked, so this may be a place that uses pre-packaged ground beef. However, I don't know that for a fact. We found ours a bit overcooked  for our taste. Also burgers are made for a normal appetite, not huge. The fries were good, crinkle cut, regular thickness as opposed to shoestring. Prices are reasonable.<//text>< Rating>

I like the variety of menu items and the pricing was a bit more than expexcted.

Burger was good but greasy. I'll give it a higher rating only because they were super busy. I think the quality would have been better if they weren't so slammed.

I would go again but would not go out of my way for shake shack.

In n out is still better imho.<//Review>

The burger was good, a little too spicy for my taste. Everything else was basic. The price was the the ridiculous part. Almost $3 for a kids size drink​!?! And no combo meals?!?< /Text>

I like the variety of menu items and the pricing was a bit more than expexcted.

Burger was good but greasy. I'll give it a higher rating only because they were super busy. I think the quality would have been better if they weren't so slammed.

I would go again but would not go out of my way for shake shack.

In n out is still better imho.< /text>

Shake Shack was awful. My burger was burned, the bun was soggy, the milkshake was a combination of bland and odd tasting, and the fries were too salty. But at least it was overpriced.<//Text>

<Review>The food is good that you can definitely start stacking up the sugar calories and fat real quick when you start ordering their rich milkshakes in their triple stack burgers with melting cheese coming out of every side and a bunch of bacon it's up to you what you get but either way you'll be satisfied with the taste that's for sure.< /Review>< pics>

<review>Almost ate here. Decided against it as I entered. Extremely loud, unorganized, messy, and rude staff. All around, I'd give em less than 1 star if I could, and I haven't even tried the food. My friend went ahead and ordered food. Fries overcooked and over salted. Asked for no cheese, didn't listen. She said at least the soda fountain works right.</review>< pictures>

Worst place e to drop by. This clerk with rounf face, beared, short black hair mexium build won’t stop to bug customers. I have photos not sure where to post. Think eat there is heakthy, use mobile is taboo, use restroom is forbidding while fix a sock, hanging  around is trespassing. Why do they put out chairs in the middle of the street?!</review>

Small burgers that are not that special.  Would rather have any other choice,ie. in n out, habit, five guys.  Not worth the hype nor the price< /review>

Burnt and dried deconstructed chicken breast sandwich with spread everywhere except the buns, way over priced no combo meals available. Cold Bacon &cheese fries Definition of WhakShack. I definitely will make my own Chicken sandwiches and gourmet spread from now on.<//text>

I like this place as much as SmashBurger. Simple but delicious burgers and yummy milkshakes. My favorite is the black and white milkshake.<//Review>

<Rating>3</Rating><Review>found this place down hollywood boulevard. my travel companion wanted to go in and get a milk shake. walking into it and was greeted by a very cheerful member of staff. asking if it was our first time and then tryed to sell us a membership card. we only wanted a drink. this took an age to arrive. we sat at a table and waited. must have taken 15 mins for a milkshake and a coke. milkshake was average and the coke was a coke. there wasnt many customers. a milkshake and coke from mc donalds would have been as good. but she can tick it off her list and say shes been there.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Edit: 10/25/2016 Awesome!!!  Google/Shake Shack is using my photo as the main pic!   Discount Shake Shack?

1st time here.  Food is great and so is the service.  Ordered 5 single ShackBurger + PBBB + cheese fries + new BaconCheddar fries with 3 vanilla 2 strawberry shakes.  Good stuff.

So why 5 stars?  I asked if they validate.  Unfortunately answer is no at the moment but one of the manager's Brandon  (not in uni) assured me they should and they will for customers.  For being opened since yesterday, very organized.

Come back?  U betcha!<//Review>

<Review>I have been ordering food in LA for all my life and sometimes you find a pearl of a screw up. So, it's a Friday night, it's raining and cold, and getting burgers for the family were the best bet. We ordered through GrubHub and since the order never arrived, we called.

Shake Shack's staff was unbelievably rude, unhelpful and dismissive of our issue. They didn't have our order, they didn't want to solve the issue and all they did was push us towards GrubHub. So, 1h30 after ordering, we called GrubHub and guest what? It was Shake Shack's fault: their wi-fi is off, so NO orders are getting through, still, they are active on the delivery systems. That's a major screw up, if you ask me. If you have an issue with your system, you should notify the delivery services to avoid problems like this, not just treat customers like garbage.

Good job, Shake Shack! That's how you lose customers faster than it takes your staff to mistreat them!< /Review>< UserId.>

I love ShakeShack !! This particular shop its not the best i've seen. There was quite a waiting line and the amount of tables was limited. But the burguers tho, they make up for everything. This are probably the best fast food burguers you are ever going to taste. I've been told that the shakes are good too but i've never had one. Ps: allways get the chedar and bacon fries.
There is also a shroom burguer for vegans<//Text>

Good burger for a fast food chain (still nowhere near what could be made at home on a grill). A bit expensive for what you get.<//review>

First timer. Ordered single burger. When it came, it was just a puny piece of meat and bun. No fixings, no lettuce, no tomato, no onion, no mayo, no mustard, nothing. Cost $4.99 before tax. What's with the hype? They didn't ask me if I wanted fixings when i ordered, but seems you're supposed to ask for fixings when you order. Overpriced burger.< /Review>

Fries were good, shake was thick, and burger tasted fine, but it's sloppy presentation and seemingly thrown together nature leaves me a bit disappointed from all the hype.</review>

The food is very good. It is a little more expensive then similar types of hamburgers joints, but food is also much higher quality so it is worth it.< /text>

Good shakes, but overrated burgers. The food was good, but it was pricey. Two burgers, two fries, and two sodas will set you back $40.00.< /text>

< review>
I have already reviewed the hamburgers that Shake Shack offers in my review of the West Hollywood Shake Shack. The quality and taste is the same between both of these locations so you can read my review of the West Hollywood location if you are interested in how I thought Shake Shack and In & Out Burger compared to one another (hint: they are quite different so any comparison isn't going to be fair to either chain). Needless to say, the burgers at this location is just as outstanding as in all Shake Shack locations. This time around I decided to try out the Chick-n-shack chicken sandwich and b out am I glad I did. This is one really good chicken sandwich. They coat a thick chicken brest in a mildly spiced batter and fry it to a beautiful crispy golden brown. Someone had posted a picture of their chicken sandwich for this location and I found that picture to be a perfect representation of the chicken sandwich I received. You might notice that the color of the fried coating looks perfectly even (almost too perfect) and that is exactly how my sandwich looked. It was chicken perfection in every bite. Crispy on the outside and wonderfully moist all the way thru. I also decided to try their original Shack lemonade instead of a shake this time around. Their shakes are heaven sent but my waistline and wallet might start to disagree with that if I start drinking too many of them. Their lemonade was really good and is now my second favorite lemonade. Louise's BBQ still serves up my favorite lemonade which very safely sits in a league all its own. This Hollywood location is just as modern, hip, young and stylish as the West Hollywood location but is a bit smaller. I would estimate that there is a bit less than  half the interior dining space at the Hollywood location when compared to the West Hollywood location. They do have a fairly large outdoor patio though and the patio is offset back and away from Hollywood Blvd enough that you tend to forget that there is a busy street about 50 feet away. The patio is offset from the boulevard enough that I find that I prefer the patio dining over the interior (weather permitting) because it is more peaceful and tranquil. So grab a few friends and enjoy a warm early evening on their patio with good friends and good food. You won't be disappointed. I almost forgot. They are a little bit pricey (I can have two full meals at In & Out Burger for what one full mall costs here) but all of the stylish design does come at a price. That is why I rate them at 4 instead of 5 stars. The service and good is 5 stars all the way but I am not sure it is entirely worth all of the added cost. FYI - For some odd reason Google Maps is indicating that the Hollywood Shake Shack is located behind the Dunkin Donuts. While the address is correct, Shake Shack is not located behind the Dunkin Donuts. It isn't even located in that same building (multi-building complex). Shake Shack is located in the next building east of the building that Dunkin Donuts and the CVS Pharmacy is in. The entrance is right on Hollywood BLVD do you can't miss it.</review>

<Text>Great place for well made hamburgers
They messed up our orders 3x but made up for it through fast and courteous customer service. LPT their mushrooms burger is not a hamburger with grilled mushrooms...It's actually a portabello hamburger (veggie only)</Text>< Pictures>

Expected more from this place I rather have in n out, my wife got a rootbeer float and they only put one scoop of ice cream and the burger was salty... plus so much immature kids coming in and out acting a fool and employees not caring for what's going on.</text>

GREAT BURGERS. The service is pretty awful, parking isn't easy (as with most places in this area), so that keeps this from being the perfect lunch place. The line can get pretty long too. But even with those drawbacks the food is SO GOOD that it makes it so worth it.<//Text>

The food is not that grate and it's expensive  I was very disappointed with my meal all I could taste on my burger was the Dijon mustard and also the fake cheese that they use for their fries..</review>

(Translated by Google) it really has nothing to do with fast food! It tastes so incredibly good, you can't believe it. Was my first shake shack that I was in and the best too! Nice staff, clean and nice opportunity to sit outside.

(Translated by Google) Hyper delicious! I find two problems: Lack of parking (And if you get very expensive) and delivery time because it is super full. BUT it's worth the wait, I tried the Smoke Shack and the potatoes with cheese. The latter are rebuenas!

(Original)
Hiper deliciosas! Le encuentro dos problemas: La falta de estacionamiento (Y si consigues carísimo) y el tiempo de entrega porque está super lleno. PERO vale la pena la espera, probé la Smoke Shack y las papas con queso. Estas últimas están rebuenas!!!< /Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) It's a fast food restaurant that's great for resolving meals and taking a walk around Hollywood streets.
The whipping cream is essential for the shake, so it is essential to fry the cheese

<review>(Translated by Google) You can park in the underground paid parking lot and eat it here. Personally, it seems like a good place to stop by on the way to the Griffith Observatory. It is nice that there is a street of stars right next to it.
Anyway, the in-and-out was more delicious. Burger King was better than in and out ...

(Original)
지하 유료 주차장에 주차하고, 여기서 쉑쉑 드실 수 있습니다. 개인적으로는 그리피스 천문대 가는길에 들러서 먹기 좋은 장소 같습니다. 바로 옆에 스타의 거리도 있어서 좋고요.
암튼 전 인앤아웃이 더 맛있었습니다. 인앤아웃보단 버거킹이 더 맛있었고요...</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It was relatively vacant, probably because it was near the outskirts of the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
However, I didn't pour the wine I ordered and threw away the order sheet, so I had to wait a long time until I told the clerk in charge at the cash register that there was no wine. Please confirm the contents of the order with chitin before disposing of the order sheet.

(Original)
ハリウッドウォークオブフェームの外れに近い場所にあるためか、比較的空いていた。
しかし、オーダーしたワインを一緒に注がず、オーダーシートを捨てたため、レジで担当した店員にワインが出てないことわ告げるまで結構待たされた。オーダーの内容はキチンと確認してから、オーダーシートを処分するようにしてほしい。<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Certainly are good burgers. French fries can be improved. And the great beer. A little expensive.

Good burgers. Fries can be better, good beer. A little bit to expensive

Sin duda alguna son unas buenas hamburguesas. Las papas fritas se pueden mejorar. Y la cerveza genial. Un poco costoso.

<review>(Translated by Google) It is located across from W Mall on the east side of Hollywood Street and is a little off the busy street. The store is spacious, the outdoor bench area is clean, and the staff are friendly. The bathroom was neat, but I had to use a password at the entrance. Don't throw away your password as it is written on the bottom of your receipt. Free WiFi provided

(Translated by Google) I made the mistake of choosing a spicy option! Which was unintentional since I know what it is and is not spicy ... It was SmockShake, something like that. It was not a good experience. But the fries were a hit in the meal, they are very good. The soda is refillable as in all the restaurants that I went to California.

(Original)
Fiz a besteira de escolher uma opção picante! O que foi sem querer já que sei bem o que é e não é spicy... Era o SmockShake, algo assim. Não foi uma boa experiência. Mas as fritas deram uma salvada na refeição, são bem boas. O refri é refil como em todos os restaurantes que frequentei pela Califórnia.<//Text>
