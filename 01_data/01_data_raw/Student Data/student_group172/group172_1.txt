<Review>The website needs a little fix somethings need to be updated. But other than that I love this place it’s to closet place to buy YuGiOh cards they usually have all the newest packs. Also the customer service here is pretty good. I honestly wish this place gets more business this place is really cool for table top games.</Review>< username>

Really chill atmosphere. Service is great except for when they are crazy busy with tournaments. Tourneys held here are pretty awesome too. Been here a few times and loved the chill environment. Everything card based is placed.</text>

I was not able to stay to play any games as I was there somewhat early, but I was told they have a very casual Commander/EDH community here so if you're into that they have you covered. A good selection of sleeves can be found here and they also carry Ultra Pro Satin Towers which half of the stores I've been to don't even sell, plus you can get them for a very good price.<//review>< Resp>

This place is a must if you're a huge nerd. You can play whatever games they have there and games you bring for free. They also have a PlayStation. They sell dice and figures among other things. Really lax atmosphere, a good place to chill with friends.< /Text>

This place is an amazing shop to hang out at. There's an abundance of tables for playing the free board games they offer, playing cards games, and etc. The staff are very nice and are willing to help you find out what you need. My experience in this shop has been a blast with friends and hang outs.</text>

Best place just to hang out & play some games. Pokemon & Yugioh prices are always amazing here. Benny's always down to catch a game of FIFA! Great environment, highly recommended people check it out!</Text>

Come play Magic The Gathering here. I guess they have other games but you should sell those other cards back to the store and just play Magic. If you're playing Yu-Gi-Oh you're not living your life right and your mother wants you to move out of her garage, if you play Dragon Ball Z it's because Super Saiyan Goku is your hero and if he went to your JR High he definitely would be your friend. The Blackstone Owl also has a great selection of board games,  D&D materials, and if you're a Magic player with a girlfriend and not a lonely DBZ player, they sell Loungefly Purses and other assorted accessories so you can grab your girl a present while you play Magic the day before your anniversary. If you aren't coming here for all of your collectible card game needs then you should be, get your life together and stop buying those Pokemon blister packs at Target and just get what you need at the Blackstone Owl.< /Text>

Open area with tables to play ccg games. Only carried core dnd books but have a set of dice with purchase. The staff was friendly. Looked to cater towards card games. Did have some board games.<//review>

<Review>Terrible customer service... picked out a quince dress back in January and they said they would have the alterations done by June.... yesterday we had an appointment, we went back and they called us to say it wasn’t ready as we were already on our way. They forced my dad to pay off the rest of the dress or else they wouldn’t schedule us for another fitting which wouldn’t even have been necessary in the first place if they had just fixed up the dress in the 5 months they had to do it...</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>worst place to buy a dress. we ordered my 15 dress back in April and we were told it would be ready by May 28. May 27 we get a call saying it would be ready by June 10. Today we were called saying that the company no longer makes the dress. We had to fight with the owner to get our deposit back.< /text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Worse experience ever. Brides, if you do not want to stress about your dress, do NOT go to this place. They rescheduled me twice and literally worked on my dress while I was there to pick it up. Prices are affordable, but not worth all the stress I went through. Jules, the manager is highly unprofessional, Roxy the seamstress is rude, and honestly the only person who actually took anytime to help and apologize was Frankie. I guess you get what you pay for, wish I would have went with David's Bridal.<//Review>

<Text>Worst place ever! Quincenera dress was not ready on time! That place is a nightmare.  Very unprofessional and unorganized! That place should shut down!  Read reviews before choosing a place! Sadly I didn't do it this time.</Text>< Pictures>

Order my wedding dress on 5/5/2021, my wedding is June 26, 2021 out town so need the dress a week before.they cancel the first fitting made an appointment for two weeks later June 9 to be exact. At 2 on. I get there Roxana the old woman with hair died blonde said it was not ready yet that they will try to have it ready by 4 pm, nwe also ordered the bridesmaid dresses there too and to our surprised the color of the dress where wrong as well, the old woman was so rude and only told us the that was the color we picked we told her no that we had said what colors we wanted and she said no you got what you picked.  Then I told her that we wanted our money back and that i wanted to see my dress she told me no is not ready come back at 4. I walked outside to my cousin told her what I was told and next thing I know they are calling security to tell us to leave. We didn't know why and when ask they just ignore us.. after hours of trying to get at least my wedding dress that i had already paid for we get told to come back at 5:30 that my dress will be ready by then.. yeah crazy if it was not done in over a month there was no way it was going to be done an 30 minutes.. but any way came back at 5:45 waited about 20 more minutes and when I saw the dress it was still not done and it looked like a little kid got it and did some cutting because is was so bad. We told the old woman again and she as rude as she can be did not care.. long story we end up leaving the store with a dress that is cut really bad is not finish and it will take them long to fix I only have 2 weeks and I am going to have to buy another dress...

PLEASE DONT GO THERE YOU WILL REGREAT IT. JULIO DIAS THE MANAGER OR SO HE SAYS HE IS,  IS THE SAME WAY AS THE OLD WOMAN ROXANA. THEY WILL BE NICE TO GET YOU TO BUY THEN AFTER THAT IS A NIGHTMARE..< /review>

<text>The prices are reasonable- something for every range. And me being the only one who needed alterations that seamstress there is a magician. I was worried that there was no possible way to fit it correctly to my body and it just fit me like a glove. Hugged me in all the right spots.< /text>< pictures>

I went in February to get my dress and they told me it would be done in a month. we keep calling and every time no one answers the phone. I have postponed my 16 from July to August and now I’m postponing again because we still don’t have the dress 7 months later…
The customer service is good but i shouldn’t have to keep rescheduling if I fully paid for the dress and it still isn’t done.</review>

In my short time in the store emphasis on short, was a terrible experience, And was not a good one at all!!! Expecting to get quality service, coming in at our appointment time they had us wait an extra 2 hours just to in the end be rushed out of the store with little care on my dress! They claimed to have had spent the extra hours ironing my dress but when it came time to take it home it was all rinkled and crinkled! If it weren't to have had my dressed payed up front I would have walked out of there in a heart beat! They were very unprofessional and very unorganized! They had made "finishing touches" like cutting, and tailoring on my dress with out any prior consultation, and didn't even have my dress tried on! Wish I could put zero stars!!!< /text>

<Text>This Cinderella Closet Store..... Don't come here at all.
Really bad services and on top of that they stole my & my daughter shoes. I came to this store to pick up my daughter dress (Sweet 15). And I forgot my daughter shoes and my in that store. We came back an hour later and told the lady that we forgot our shoes here and request to see the cameras but the lady didn't want to show us the camera. She refused.  I'm 100% sure she had our shoes. My daughter was very sad.
I recommend you not to come to this store because they Never had the dress ready, they will make u come several times, you will be waiting for HOURS even though you have an appointment with them. Because the only way they will see u is with APPOINTMENTS ONLY!!!!!<//Text><Time>1569123290847</Time>< UserId.>

<text>DO NOT COME HERE !! They promise you they’ll have your items ready by a certain date and don’t go through with it. My wedding is in 3 weeks and I still don’t know if my dress is ready. I’ve called over 50 times and no one answers or when they answer they can’t help me Because “the person in charge isn’t there” they always tell me to call back and I do and then they don’t answer again. Don’t waste your time here.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<rating>1</rating><text>One star is too many!! This place is horrible and not recommended AT ALL!!! I came in to order my wedding dress in October! Paid the deposit came back to pay more in November. My dress was supposed to be ready by end of April and NOTHING! I called them non stop the whole month of May and at times well most of the time there phones were not working!!! It created a lot of stress. My wedding was June 1st and I got my first fitting may 23 in which the dress was 2 sizes bigger when in fact they said the dress was going to be made to my measurements... so of course I still had to pay 120$ more for them to alter the dress, which was completely unfair!! They called me to get the “last fitting” three days before my wedding and of course they called me the day before to tell me the alteration were not finished!!! I had to go one day before my wedding to get the fitting and the dress was still not finished. I got there at 11am and left till 5pm....this whole experience WAS HORRIBLE!!!!</text>< pictures>

So disappointing, they only care about the sale. We walked in and we liked a dress but, they only had one size small and we needed a size XL so, they said they could order the dress but, I had to leave a cash deposit of 50% to place the order. Then we had to make an appointment to go back to try the dress a month later. Our appointment time was 10:00 am and we had to leave 3 hours before because we're coming from San Diego. We arrived at 10 am and there are 2 other families waiting for the same appointment time. The doors are locked and the workers didn't show up until 10:50 am, almost an hour later. They gave no apologies, as if they always do that. We had to wait another hour to finally try on the dress because they attended one family at a time. Finally we tried the dress on and it was way too small, when we took the dress off we saw the tag was a size small! What a waste of time! They tried to say the manufacturer sent the wrong size but, that was the same size small we looked a month before. So we had to make another appointment for 3 weeks later, and we had to drive back to LA again. We checked the tag again and this time the tag was cut off. We tried the dress and it fit much better but, it was a little snug. We took the dress because they would not refund the cash, and we didn't want to drive back to LA again. Do not trust these guys with your cash.</Review>

<date>1531508483612< /date><Text>Worst place ever!! Straight out fraud. They told us our daughters dresses were going to be hand made therefore the price $100 a piece. They took measurements and said they would be ready in a week or so. Came back today and come to find they ORDERED their dresses both on the same size and none of them fit on them. They were too big. Now they also want to charge me for alterations to the dresses that were supposed to be hand made in the first place. Very condescending guy in charge, his name is Freddy. He was dealing with another angry customer and was being extremely rude. They do whatever they want since people come pick up their dresses a day or two before so it makes it nearly impossible to take your business elsewhere. Avoid this place at all costs and if you decide to give them a chance have them write everything down on the contract they give you. Whatever they promise and say have them write it down, sign it and get a copy from them.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

She tried getting her money back and they didn’t want to give it to her. Freddy, Julio and the rest of the employees are liars and are so full of it. I’ve seen her try to call numerous of times and they’re always just trying to avoid talking to her. They’re always rude and so unproffesional. I don’t understand why this place isn’t closed down.

I wish I could give ZERO stars. Just talked to manager who treated me terribly. All they care about is making a sale. Their salesperson promised me dresses over a month ago and I haven't received them. Then the manager tells me I will have to pay $40 to get the dresses delivered to me and when I asked for a refund he refused. FRAUD. They also pressure you to pay cash so you have no choice to dispute charges. Manager is rude and doesn't care about customer. He then tells me the salesperson should not have told me they were going to mail me dresses because they don't do that and that he fired that person because of things like that. He fired her but I still don't have dresses and he did not care one bit. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PLACE!!! I have placed a complaint with BBB case # 630165 and hopefully this fraud will stop.</review>

Fiancé drove 3 hours To there store and spent about 500 dollars and didn’t have what she wanted in stores so they had to ship it to us but they charged us 28$for shipping when we received it and we didn’t know about it.

Horrible place!!! I ordered my daughters dress the end of January and I’m still waiting for it today. We leave for Italy in less than two weeks and still no dress! If the dress doesn’t arrive I will be suing them for damages! Stay away from this place you’ll regret it everyday!!!!</Text>

< review>
Roxy's Boutique provided such bad customer service that I would not get married again if given the choice.

On my first visit, the staff was super friendly. I felt welcomed and was happy to have come upon a store with such friendly staff. Boy was I wrong. Friendly Freddy, or so I thought so, sold me up on a dress (which would include the veil and the tailoring) and scheduled my next appointment. A deposit needs to be given just for them to bring the dress.

I called multiple of times to confirm my second appointment which was at 10:30am. No answer. I started to freak out. I arrived on time to find another lady also waiting for the store to open. She informed me that the store had been canceling on her the whole week due to excuses such as "accidents", "the dress not being ready," and so on. I felt horrible for this lady as she was getting married the next day and still hadn't received her dress. The lady and I remembered that staff at Roxy's Boutique had told us they were the same at CINDERELLA'S CLOSET. We walked together and found Freddy providing service to another customer. By now it was 11am! I told Freddy I had my appointment at 10:30am and he was the one who scheduled it. He now claimed that he had nothing to do with the other store, even though he wrote his name on the contract he had given me. The lady and I went back to Roxy's Boutique. It finally opened past 11am. We were greeted by Leslie who told the lady her dress wouldn't be in until 2pm. The lady was furious at the fact that she had been calling the whole week and they never gave her a specific time. The lady for the meanwhile left, and I informed Leslie that my appointment was at 10:30am and she lashed out at me. She claimed and showed me that I was scheduled for 11am in their binder. I tried showing her my contract with the time of 10:30am, but she responded by YELLING, "Us staff have the same rights as you customers!" At this point I wanted to get my deposit back and take my business elsewhere, but I knew that wasn't an option. Leslie fitted my dress and scheduled my next appointment. They ask for the full amount of the cost of the dress before they start tailoring it.

I asked for the day off from work for my next appointment. I called multiple times before and on my way to my next appointment. When they finally answered and told me the dress wasn't ready, I was already nearby (I live 2 hours away). They rescheduled me.

I asked for the day off from work for my rescheduled appointment. When I arrived, the store looked different. I was greeted by Julio/Julian. He informed me that the store now had a new owner (after further conversation with staff, I learned the new owner is still within family/family friends). However, they had my dress. I wasn't able to try it on during my scheduled time because we had to wait for another lady to come. She was a young lady about the age of 17. When I tried on the dress, it was still too long. A tailor was brought in and told me she could fix the dress, but I would have to come back. I was no longer willing to go back due to losing days of work and the commute; This was supposed to be my last visit. I tried getting compensation back for at least the tailoring part of the dress since I would have to pay someone else to fix it, but I was told no refunds were given, even though they didn't do the job correctly. There is a quote that says, "Arguing with an idiot makes two of them," and by this point I was over the whole experience that I just wanted to leave and never come back.  I took my dress and was able to find a tailor as soon as I arrived home. The new tailor showed me how the dress was fixed by Roxy's Boutique, and all the tailoring was horrible!

Horrible experience and customer service. After being sold on a dress by friendly staff, appointments were never on time, cancelations were last minute, tailoring was not correct, and no refunds were given for not completing their job correctly on tailoring the dress. Spare yourself the trouble, panic and anxiety attacks of giving your business to Roxy's Boutique.< /review>

Don’t tell them the date of your 15 because they will give you the dress a week before the actual event or days before the actual event and they don’t care if you’re waiting for them for a long time because they had me waiting until seven in the night to get my dress and I had gone at three They told me that they were going to fix the back part of my dress that was supposed to tie it together and they didn’t they left it without a button that is in the back. They steamed my dress to make it less wrinkled but it ended up taking off the color and leaving marks on my dress that looked very bad and when I tried on my first fitting there was water all over the dress and the  thing that goes under the dress to make it big was covered in like blood or something  The crowns are very cheap when I took my crown home she had messed it up because she said that she use the hot glue gun to put the stones back on and the stones turned yellow and they were silver in the beginning!!!!!!I was very disappointed I shouldn’t have  to Pitchin my own money to fix the crown that’s new But they don’t care about  The things that you buy as long as you get them they’ll give it to you even if it’s ripped my bouquet was part of a packet that they came with but they never told me that those were the only choices I get I strongly suggest you guys choose another reliable place that is actually worth it because I got my dress like three days ago And the stones are already falling off and I’ve only worn it once For the first fitting.I REALLY SUGGEST THAT YOU DONT COME AND SHOP IN THIS STORE PLZ DONT ITS NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!< /text>

Don’t come here they canceled my appointment and they gave me another one and when I got their the dress was not ready nothing was ready . I got so mad . They where bearly starting to do all my stuff and it was annoying and they did not put the same type of flowers to my selves . They have nice dress but their customer service is horrible .I asked if they can put the correct things on it but nothing came out right and  Even if you ask the manger to help you she just rolls her eyes at you and talks to you in a mean voice . Worst experience here I would never come back here .<//review>

This is the best furniture store in the high desert hands down. Their customer service and prices are unbeatable. I have bought multiple furniture items from them and every time its the best prices. Every person that I recommend to them have had great experiences as well. You just have to see it your self, but be sure their prices are the lowest you'll find and for the same products if not better.<//review>

What a hidden little gem! My family and I decided to stop by for a quick second, I'm so glad we did. The furniture is phenomenal and the service is great. Our Salesman, John and Chris, were very friendly and knowledgeable of all the different furniture in the catalog. He packed my furniture and wrapped it to go for me, which was unexpected but a nice gesture and loaded it all for me! It's apparent he made sure that all of our needs were met. I ordered the dressers, dining and sofa sectional and I could choose my own fabric which was very delightful, picking my own color and fabric felt like I was an Interior designer. I also got it in a timely manner and may I just say, probably the best seat cushion I've ever had! Will definitely be shopping to buy from here for now on whenever I need any kind of furniture and would highly recommend to friends/family.<//text>

<Text>I am very happy that my boyfriend and I found this place. Not only do they have great quality furniture for great prices but everyone there is helpful and friendly. Chris and John are great and helped us set up payments for a beautiful sectional and entertainment wall. Our next purchase from them will be a bunk bed set for our boys that we got an amazing deal on. We are very happy to have found a good business with good people to help make our new house into a home. I would defiently recommend anyone to The Furniture Store!<//Text><gmapID>0x80c3665b082faea1:0x9f631df536ab1782<//gmapID>< pics>

We went to two other furniture stores in the area and both were only showing us the most expensive pieces on the floor. Stopped here and 30 minutes later drove off with exactly what we wanted at a price we could afford! We just bought our house, so there is much more we need to buy to make this house our home... The Furniture Store will be getting all of our business!< /review>< pictures>

<text>Went in June 14th to buy a coffee table and matching end pieces. Was told by these two stoner looking kids that it was in stock already so we should be able to pick it up June 23. June 23 came and went and didn’t hear anything. Tried to call and they couldn’t help me over the phone. Went to the store and he tells me that it won’t be in stock till July 11 and that they never give specific dates because nothing set in stone. I guess if you see two stoner looking kids- take what they say lightly.< /text>< Pics>

{'time': 1593411365110, 'text': 'Yes mam sometimes the system does show instock and sometimes there is a small chance there is only 1 quantity but unfortunately our systems do not show a quantity so we can only go based on the information of what the system shows for the manufactures warehouse. That is pretty wrong to call someone or two in this story. "Stoner looking kids" I do not smoke nor does any employees working here. We apologize that you were told an item was instock with the manufacture but there is that chance the system shows instock and is not really in the warehouse. These are clerical errors that we cannot control.  We did give you all the options to give you back your money, wait for the product you ordered to come back instock or choose a different item. You chose to get your money back which is your right. So we are very sorry you had to experience this, this is an error across the world with all stores even walmart. It will show instock 1 quantity but it wont actually be there. If we knew they did not have stock we definently would of told you upfront at the store before purchase so keep in mind that nobody would intentionally sell you a product and give you high hopes that your product is coming by that certain date if they weren\'t certain at the time of the sale. So we just want to apologize and let you know deep and sincere that nobody here at the furniture store would intentionally sell you a product with this kind of expectation on purpose.'}< /Response>

Well first off I ordered some furniture online! Big mistake. Online it said I would receive my furniture in 5-7 days. It’s been 12 days and still have not received my furniture. Every time I call they give me the run around n I still haven’t received my furniture.< /text>

{'time': 1590368960728, 'text': 'Sir if you go to our website at checkout it clearly shows estimated time of arrival 7-10 business days. If you ordered your furniture 5/12/2020 that would mean that it is still within that 7-10 business days. We are not sure why we deserve a 1 star review when our website clearly says 7-10 business days and we have not gone over that timeframe yet. Please call us so we can help you get your furniture as soon as possible. We dont have a customer by the name of Gilbert Tovar in our records no such name has purchased from us.'}</response>

Been coming here for over 20 years bought a couch back in 2002 and it is still in great condition but wanted a more modern style. I’ve shopped around for price and they have the best price in town

The service was great! I will be coming back again to get more furniture< /text>

I am at loss for words and that never happens. All I can say is that R. Kassman’s piano store in Berkeley is now my favorite place to visit and purchase both new and used pianos. Some people think you have to have a ton of space to have/collect keyboards and pianos. Simply isn’t the case. There is something for everyone. I encourage anyone that loves pianos but hasn’t yet purchased one to take the leap. R. Kassman piano store has an awesome selection and they are super helpful and knowledgeable.</text>

<Text>This is where you want to go to buy a piano! Rick showed us a number of options for the upright piano that we were looking for. Rick is knowledgable about how each piano is constructed and why it sounds the way it does.  The variety of choices together with the education made it easy to select the upright that sounded best for the intended purpose: a Baldwin.  In all the service is professional and friendly, the piano offering is extensive and the price is right.< /Text>< rate>

<review>Here's another Steingraeber fan.I bought Steingraeber piano from the R..As described by another customer. Kassman pianos is a shop that sells pianos. I haven't been this enthusiastic about an investment in along time. The feeling is incredible as soon as you work into the showroom . In my grand home ,the piano is completely stunning. I couldn't be happier with the level of service and inventory.👍</review><response>{'time': 1619714409041, 'text': 'Thank you. Yea, Steingraeber is the finest and so glad you are happy with yours.

<rating>1</rating><text>Russell Kassman sold me a piano that was 8 years old and told me it is new! While the piano had no factory warranty, he told me it has a 10-year factory warranty.
I went to his store on Jan 19 with my pianist cousin to buy a piano for my 30th Birthday! He imposed time constraints on us, to rush our discussion making process. We liked a Brodmann PE-121 piano. He told us it is new and it has a 10 year Brodmann warranty. He did not let us take any photo of its serial number with some weird reasoning. This should have alarmed me that he is not being transparent and lying about something, but I thought as he mentioned he is retiring soon, why would he lie as much as he did! We decided to buy it, he told us there is %3 extra credit/debit card charging, so I told him I will bring him the check, he said I need an appointment for bringing the check! At this point I decided to leave, he got scared and said I could mail the check to him. I signed the contract, not realizing he has not put 10 years Brodmann warranty in the paperwork. After I signed the contract and gave him $50 deposit, I took a photo of the serial number(attached)! As I did not like his manner, I started to read his terrible overall reviews(especially on yelp with 89 people 1 star, image attached). I contacted Brodmann and I figured the piano was 8 years old Before Brodmann 10 year warranty policy was made! I emailed him asking for an explanation, he never responded. He has not yet refunded my $50, he ruined my 30th Birthday Gift and he wasted my Time!
Russell is a lier that would do anything to steal your money and he feels no guilt for his shameful behaviors.</text>< Pics>

I was specifically looking for a restored Steinway piano at a decent price and I found exactly what I was looking for at R. Kassman’s piano store in Berkeley. When I went in to do a thorough look-over of my purchase the owner and I got to talking. Great human. I will definitely be coming back for a smaller piano in the future. Awesome place, awesome prices.<//Review>

<text>Best selection of restored and pre-owned pianos in the Berkeley area. I actually buy pianos more frequently than most. I like to find older pianos and restore them myself, so I was especially impressed with the piano restoration efforts of R Kassman’s showroom. This place is like a treasure trove of used pianos and I’m a frequent customer. If you’re in the area and are a piano lover, definitely stop in and say hello.</text><Date>1595229516707</Date><user_name>Brian Otero< /user_name><Response>{'time': 1595252111266, 'text': 'Thank you Brian.

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>I went to the ski shop next door for renting. Just out of curiosity, I wanted to walk around this piano store and see if any set is good for my kids. The owner, a cold and rude person, stopped me in the middle of the store and told me that the visiting is only by appointment. What the hell? This is a place for selling music instrument and making people love music. My kids were with me on the spot. We were so shocked. Besides the environment inside is quite dark and gloomy.<//Text>< pics>

I recently got in the market for an upright and my piano technician recommended I check out Kassman Pianos as they had recently changed ownership. I couldn't have been happier with my experience in the store.

I walked in and was greeted by Ric who helped me the entire time I was there. You can immediately tell that Ric is very passionate and knowledgeable about his pianos, and I learned a ton about the piano I ended up purchasing just in the half hour that I was in the store. I was a little nervous to play in front of anyone as I hadn't played much in quite a while, but he gave me plenty of space and time to just sit and play so I could get a good sense of which pianos felt right for me.

I was also a bit anxious about getting the piano into my apartment since I don't have a big elevator and the staircase is a bit weird, but Ric talked me through what the process would look like for the movers and what we could do if it ended up more difficult than anticipated.

Overall I had a great experience working with Ric. If you are in the market for a piano, you should definitely check this place out.<//review>

<Review>I was driving by and saw bright SALE signs all over the front windows of this store. Having never been to this piano store before, I decided to stop in and see what they had to offer. What a horrible mistake.

The owner was extremely condescending. The entire store had an unwelcoming atmosphere. The owner told me I only had a couple minutes to look around because another customer was coming in soon who had an appointment. "You really should make an appointment," the owner told me. "Well, I didn't know. May I just look around for a couple minutes?" I ask. The owner says yes, and then follows me like a hawk throughout the store. I've never felt so uncomfortable before. It seemed as though the owner thought I was about to steal a piano by putting it in my pocket and running out the door.

Needless to say, I did not even attempt to TOUCH a piano.

There are no prices written anywhere, and the owner does not give a straight answer when asking about cost.

If you need to buy a piano, I'd recommend DC Piano or Piedmont Piano which are both nearby and have much more helpful and transparent service.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>I was rather shocked to read the negative reviews about Mr. Kassman and his store! We had a completely opposite experience there - a Very, Very good one. We went there looking for a piano for our son. While we were there, Russel took great care to listen to us (as parents) about what we were looking for - - and he also took great care in trying to understand exactly the sounds our son was looking for in a piano. He allowed our son to play all the instruments he wanted, comparing and contrasting, and offering intelligent and helpful information about each one. In the end, we purchased a lovely instrument that also looks beautiful in our home. Delivery was flawless. We enjoyed our piano buying experience greatly. Thanks, Russell!!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1535595132579, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind comments.

<gmap_id>0x80857ed1f2457f9f:0xf600dbf352af3223</gmap_id><review>Rude behavior. I called asking about where to find a person to repair chips on the lacquer. When I mentioned it was a Yamaha grand, I was told to call Yamaha. When I asked why since there seems to many people around the Bay Area offering piano restoration, I was told "because they are difficult" and then they abruptly hung up. I guess I won't be buying my next piano from them. Arrogant!
It is unfortunate that their response to my review was to say that I was told that their service department informed me that they only service the pianos they sell. Had I been told that, I would have said thank you and good day. No one explained, just hung up in a huff. Now it's my word against theirs. Of course the customer is not always right but in this case I stand by my review.
I called another piano store and got a much better response even though they also do not service third-party pianos.  They will definitely be on my list of places to visit when it's time for a new purchase.</review>< rating>

My husband and I were looking for a piano for our new home and stopped at R Kassman Pianos and were treated with respect and kindness. Russell, the owner, let us walk around and play a few different pianos to hear the sound and even played us some beautiful pieces on other pianos. He was patient and informative. We were very happy with our experience in the store and ended up buying a beautiful piano that has a gorgeous sound. I would highly recommend R Kassman Pianos to all my friends</Text>

<Text>Russell is a great guy.
After doing several months of research, I knew I wanted a Baldwin baby grand. Which Baldwin, I didn't know. I called R Kassman in Berkeley and the owner immediately gave me a great price on one of the models over the phone. They were very patient with me and took the time to answer all my questions. As another reviewer mentioned, the owner had a great amount of knowledge about pianos and about the piano community in the Bay Area. There were no sales tactics! I appreciated that.
I walked in later that week, played all three models, wrote them a check and within days a gorgeous piano arrived at my doorstep.
I've been recommending R Kassman to my friends and have heard that they've all had good experiences. Give them a call yourself.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>I recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a high quality piano and a high quality experience!
The pianos in the showroom just shine and beg to be played.  We walked around the store as he explain the different types and brands to us.  I sat down and tried several out.
Knowing our budget, Russell took us around to the more "modestly priced" pianos.  We found the perfect piano.  It was delivered quickly to our house the next day.
Russell knows his pianos and was a joy to work with!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Absolutely awful experience. Went in and had a very rude person who essentially made us feel like we should be looking somewhere else. It's taken a while to decide to make a move on a baby grand purchase and I have to say this is one place I will NEVER go back again! Whether you're spending $ 5000 or $ 50000 I think there should be some measure of time and politeness that clearly this sales person lacked.. I hardly write reviews especially when I don't like a business but here I felt so upset after I left that I was to compelled to write one.< /review>

I was so impressed with the selection of pianos and the proprietor Russell Kassman, that I bought my piano there! This was after playing numerous pianos in Santa Barbara, San Francisco, San Jose, not to mention my area along the central coast. Buying a piano is not an easy decision. Many factors go into this decision. I had a decent budget and spent it on a wonderful preowned piano. Without Russell's help, I'm not sure I would have picked the right one. I thought his approach was thoughtful and intelligently presented. I really was impressed with myself...yes myself! I thought it would be much more difficult. I kept listening to the 4 pianos he played for me within my parameters. He kept me at a distance so I wouldn't know which piano he had played. I repeatedly chose one of them. After listening I sat at each one and played them myself. Time flew by, but I suspect it took me nearly 2 hours to arrive at my decision. He even tried to talk me out of the piano I selected, but the twinkle in his eye made me persist. I knew he was doing this for a reason. His theory was that if you are not challenged by looking at potential negatives that he might point out, you may never be happy with your choice.
I am not only happy but thrilled, sometimes to tears, each time I play this piano. I would also like to point out that his guarantee is the best I had seen. There are also a few other perks I haven't mentioned due to space and time constraints.
Within a few days it arrived at home. The movers were really good and knew what they were doing. Once they left I played for hours! It was just what I wanted. I had made the right choice. I can't recommend this "Purveyor of Fine Pianos" enough.
Thanks Russell.< /text>

We had a great experience here. Russell Kassman took a lot of time helping us find a piano for our son. He's something of a character and a shrewd businessman, but also very reasonable. We got a fair price on a great piano which everyone from the tuner to the piano teacher has raved about. I'm sorry he's had such trouble with yelp because his business deserves at least a good look - the selection is fabulous and Russell is very knowledgable and easy to deal with."< /text>

Store is located near a recycling center. Bad neriberhood. Scary experience for ladies! Owner is super rude made customers feel like an intruder who broke into his living room.
1, When I put my hands on one of the pianos, He screams: Do not touch!
2, When I told him my budget is 5-7k, he told me "get out of my shop".
3, When I ask him what's the cheapest price on one of his piano since there were no price tag. He insults my race and told me to "stop bargain, stop playing games".
4, He also insults/bad mouth on another piano seller.
5, He unloads on me about his personal health information, he said he had cancer and he has no time for me......
I felt he needed anger management class, and the cancer could come from the inner stress cause by his impulsive, aggressive personality.</review>

I grew up with a love for Classic Pianos and have always had one in my home. I just purchased a new home and was in the market for a piano. I visited R Kassman Purveyor of Fine Pianos and was very impressed with the quality of the pianos and the customer service. From the time I stepped in the store, I was amazed at the selection of excellent instruments, as well as the condition that every piano was in. Everyone was very attentitive to my needs and took the time and effort to bring out the individual beauty and character of the pianos. The staff was helpful and knowledgeable and did everything they could do to ensure that I was comfortable during my selection process. At the end of my visit I felt confident that I made the right choice.<//Review>

I called R. Kassman on a Sunday afternoon to see if I could come by and start exploring grand pianos, wanting to upgrade from my old upright.  From the moment I stepped in the door, Russell was extremely helpful and attentive.   We spent probably 15 minutes talking, during which he was asking a number of questions, trying to understand my situation, needs / desires, and budget.  He made some suggestions on how best to audition different instruments, and while I was trying a number of them out, he shared his vast knowledge about them – the build, component quality, and so on – which was very helpful information to add to the experiential aspect of playing the instruments.

Once I settled on an instrument and we came to an agreement, he was extremely professional and responsive throughout the process – from the transaction through delivery.  He even welcomed me to go back and play the instrument for a couple of hours in the showroom to get a better feel for the instrument and how I might want it voiced.

I am extremely happy – not just with my instrument, but with the overall experience.  As a piano technician himself, Russell is knows pianos through and through, and is infinitely more than “just a salesman”.  He was more of a Matchmaker – passionately seeking to help me find the right piano for my abilities, setting, and ultimately, my long-term enjoyment.

In addition - what sets a great piano dealer apart is the way in which they go the extra mile beyond the transaction, being there for post-transaction guidance and services to help you get the most enjoyment out of your instrument.  Russell has been a champ in this regard.

Anyone in the Bay Area who is looking for a top quality piano (Russell’s inventory is second to none) with an extraordinarily knowledgeable guide, must put R.Kassmann on their list.< /review>

<Text>Finally a Bay Area piano store that has what I need! R. Kassman couldn't have been more knowledgable and helpful. It's nice to know that people still pay attention to quality and craftsmanship. I felt like my piano was in good hands at R. Kassman's piano store. Their staff got my piano sounding and feeling brand new. I wish I could give them more than 5 stars.< /Text>< Pictures>

Great place to purchase a piano. R Kassman provided my player baby grand and even advised on care and the how to' in transport to my Hacienda in Mexico when we transferred it there. He has been my purveyor and recommendation to friends of high end pianos for decades. He is by appointment only providing an exceptional level of service to the potential buyer unlike the typical public showroom experience. If you are serious about an instrument that is a legacy piece then R Kassman Piano's is the only place to purchase.< /text>

Russell Kassman has an outstanding depth of knowledge of piano instruments. His name is such legend in the symphony scene that I knew that I had to set an appointment and come to this location to see for myself. Upon meeting Russell in person I could understand how valuable his expertise was. I left the store with a greater idea of what it means to be a pianist and of all of the prestige of the profession.

If you are considering the purchase of a new piano, I absolutely recommend that you reach out to Kassman and set an appointment with him.<//review>

< Review>
I've been using Russell Kassman's repair service for years and visited the showroom for the first time recently when looking for a piano for my niece's 16th birthday. I've had nothing but good experiences getting my piano tuned and repaired, and now that I have been to the showroom and made my first order there, I can also say that the showroom and staff are outstanding. They are extremely knowledgeable, the service is wonderful, and they really make sure that the instrument is delivered exactly as it should be. My niece loves her new piano. I wish I hadn't waited so long to stop in!< /Review>

We phoned in and made an appt with Mr. Kassman and glad he is someone who is externally knowledgeable on the subject. After sitting you down to do a needs analysis he showed us the best pianos for our needs and we fell in love with one.<//Review>

<Text>R. Kassman is a true professional. He kept his word every step of the way and he has gone out of his way to make purchasing my second grand piano a pleasure. Can not say enough good things about how I was treated by this fine piano company.

Thank You Again Russell for my beautiful piano. Looking forward to upgrading in the near future.

My husband and I stepped into the store without an appointment and although it caught Mr. Kassman off guard, he showed us around. Seeing as how the pianos were all closed and nicely displayed, I knew that I perhaps should not touch them unless invited. He is very direct and passionate about pianos. I was quickly humbled when he educated us on their mechanisms, sound, and their history. I have shopped around other piano stores before and was disappointed that no other piano store was able to offer me as much background information as Mr. Kassman. It was a really huge selling point to me because I knew this man knew what he was talking about.

<review>Several months ago, I wandered into R. Kassman's store and fell in love with a lovely upright piano by the entrance. It was on sale for an amazing price, and it had an extraordinary tone. I wandered around the store looking at the huge selection. I'm not a musician, nor am I knowledgeable about pianos, but Mr. Kassman was extraordinarily gracious and took the time to answer all my questions, though I was obviously just looking around, and not likely to buy. When he told me the sale price of the beautiful upright, however, I began to consider it seriously. He's actually a wonderful musician, and played a little to show off the lovely warm tone of the instrument. A piano teacher I know then visited the store to look at the piano for me, and had a long and lovely conversation with Mr. Kassman. She advised me to buy it, because it was a wonderful piano at an amazing price. She also played one of the grand pianos. I bought my upright, but it took me a few months to make space for it. Mr. Kassman kept it for me without complaint. When I was ready to have it delivered, the service was terrific. The piano came with a free tuning within a few months. In short, I found this store's proprietor to be entirely professional, warm, and responsive to customer needs. He has a great selection of beautiful pianos, and some terrific bargains during sales.</review>< pics>

I’m writing this with the hope that no one else will ever again fall VICTIM of Mr. Russell Kassman, the store owner/salesman’s terrible temperament, his bias and insults, and his coercive and manipulative selling tactics.

He runs the place like a cemetery. He is knowledgeable and has a creepy passion for his pianos, but for certain customers, he has very little patience (except the moment before you hand him your money), and NO respect, and tons of INSULTS. His prices are ridiculously HIGH,

You will be talked down and kicked out at any time if you have a low budget. “Well, there is nothing else here for you.” For those who are paying $40K or above, he would act like your pet dog.

You will be humiliated and shamed if you are new to the piano/music World. One of your questions might disgust him immediately, and he will insult you and make you feel that you are stupid, and not worth of being educated and explained. He gets aggravated if you disagree with him on anything he says.

You will be yelled at if you missed what he said and asked again. “What did I just say? What’s your problem listening?”

Be prepared to be scolded if you touch anything in this ‘cemetery’ without his special permission. ”Don't touch!! STOP!”.

He tricked me that there was a Baldwin promotion that ended two weeks ago but he can “TRY” to get me the same ‘discount’ if he can backdate, and IF I can pay CASH. Then when I gave him $100 cash as deposit, he asked for my credit card. I must have been be under an evil spell at that moment, when I signed an ALL SALES FINAL purchase contract. (Watch out!!!)

The next day I couldn’t get that memory of insult and humiliation out of my mind. I recognized I was a victim. Then a day later I learned this “promotion price’ was $1,400 (25%) HIGHER than elsewhere. What services one can put in a NEW piano that would worth that much?!?!  You will be dealing with a sneaky and ruthless bloodsucker with NO care for his customers.

I hope no one will make the same mistake I did. Do not let him step all over you, especially if you are Asian. See complaint filed at BBB, Better Business Bureau. You will not get your deposit back easily either.

DO NOT WALK INTO THIS place at all, unless there are no other places where you can find what you want.</Text>

<review>The people at this store are rude as hell! I was talking to a guy who told me his name is "Jerry" at the store and he was literally trying to pick a fight with me, a potential paying customer.

I was later told that his real name is Russell and he has a well known reputation on Yelp as being an obnoxious and Jerk. It's not surprise that out of the 75 reviews they have received on Yelp, 53 of them are ONE STAR!

They deserve to fail or get into all kinds of troubles. God damn this store!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>My daughter and I have been searching for a piano for over 6 months when we visited Russell's store last month and it was an eye-opening experience.  Russell was the first person who gave us a real education on the different brands/models out there and let us try a dozen different pianos multiple times until we settled on the one that really felt like the one that was right for us.  The entire time Russell was listening to what we really wanted, was very honest and knowledgable with regards to brands, their history, technology, etc and remained pleasant and professional, working with us for more than an hour after the store had closed.  He followed through the entire process until after delivery.  You can tell he has a strong passion for quality pianos and really cares about delivering a quality product to his customers.  We are extremely happy with our purchase and felt we were offered a very good price.  Highly recommend R. Kassman Pianos as we experienced dozens of piano salesman during our search and Russell definitely stood out above the rest of them without that typical "used car" salesman approach.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I live in Salt Lake area and teach piano and over the years have sent many of my students the long distance to buy their piano because Mr. Kassman has a collection of instruments and the expertise that I have not found locally or any where else in my travels. This week I again purchased another piano, but this time achieved my life long dream of buying a new German Sauter Grand Piano!! I am thrilled and I can't recommend this company highly enough!

<review>My wife and I met because of our love of pianos. She is a classically trained pianist, and I am a piano instructor that her sister hired for her daughter. Long story short, collecting pianos and other instruments is one of our many interests. We truly enjoy an opportunity to visit a piano gallery, and when we moved to California from the east coast, we went searching for the best piano dealers. We have some extra space in our new home, and were playing the idea of adding to our collection.

We visited R. Kassman Pianos a few weeks ago, and we were very impressed. We have high expectations, and while some of the first places we checked out on the West Coast didn't impress us much, the selection at R. Kassman is beautiful and unique. Nothing typical. I love an instrument with a good story, and there is no shortage of good stories.

Some other piano galleries have lovely pianos, but don't have the expertise to properly repair some of them. It has ruined more than a few pianos I have encountered that just were not up to par anymore because they were improperly maintained. The pianos that we looked at here had been carefully researched and kept in their original state as much as possible.

I saw a few pieces similar to those I had looked at on the East Coast, and when I checked prices, I found that they were priced well. R. Kassman isn't an individual that is out to make a quick dollar from his customers, and I found my knowledge and interest were welcomed here... The staff are just as sharp</review>< Pics>

<Review>I'm a pianist, not currently living in the Bay Area, and I totally agree with the negative reviews posted here.  I lived in San Francisco from 1985 to 2001, and heard tons of horror stories about this guy.  If you walked into his store in SF, all handsome and nicely dressed (especially with an MD or a JD behind your name, or just plain loaded, especially gay and loaded), dollar signs popped into his eager eyes.  If he thought you didn't "belong there", he'd let you know.  This guy is a relentless elitist.  Great pianos, but absolutely shameful service, for some customers at least.  No one should have to put up with that kind of service.  Just saying.<//Review>< Pics>

Bought a gorgeous and brilliantly tuned, white baby grand piano from Kassman.  This man was like some ancient piano mystic when it came to his expansive knowledge of pianos.  When I came into the store, I was greeted kindly and was basically given the grand tour.  Down-to-earth, knowledgeable, and a true master of his trade, Kassman made this purchase a real pleasure.  I highly recommend getting your piano from R. Kassman.</text>

Total scammer. This guy puts piano ads in Craigslist posing as private sales, then replies posing as some made-up person saying the piano's on consignment at Kassman. You go there to see the piano but then he'll say how terrible of a piano it is, how the buyer upgraded to one of his fake Made in China pianos with German or American sounding names, and he tries to sell you one of those. Those Chinese pianos are total garbage backed by fake companies that go out of business every few years, change names, and void all warranty claims. If that isn't bad enough, the guy is extremely rude and condescending.<//Review>

Mr. Kassman is one of the most knowledgable people I've ever met in looking at pianos. I would classify him as a true pro and I appreciate someone who really knows their business. I've been playing the piano since I'm 5 and teaching since im 17. For more than 30 years I've been around pianos and I have no reservations what so ever in recommending Kassman's to any serious piano buyer.</Review>

<text>I bought a piano at Kassman this afternoon, and for me, it was an excellent experience. There's a widely varying opinion about this shop in these comments, and I think there's a good deal of confusion too. Here's how I see it.

Although Kassman looks like a run-of-the-mill piano shop from the outisde, that's not what it is. Don't expect to walk in, take a look around, turn yourself or your kids loose to plink a few keys, and think that since you're the customer, you're always right. You're not. Russell, the gentleman who owns the shop, clearly posts that his shop serves customers by appointment only, and if you can't follow this simple rule, don't be shocked if he turns you away. It might be better if you don't think of this shop as a retail store at all. Really, it's nothing like Walmart or Target, nor is it like most other piano shops.

Russell is a specialist, and if you think of him like he's a Doctor of Pianos (a Pianologist?), you'll do better from the start. Just imagine if you were to walk into a dermotologist's office unannounced, barge into an examination room where the doctor is already seeing someone, declare that you've got an itch you want looked at right away, and that you'll just fidget with the equipment in the office while you wait for the doctor to finish up with the other patient. You'll almost certainly be asked to leave and not come back. What's more, no sensible person would blame the doctor in this situation, or complain that the office gives bad service.

The key to having a good experience at Kassman is to know what you're getting into. You need to be serious about buying a piano. You need to have a budget. You need to make an appointment. Once you arrive, you must be ready to be examined by an expert, and to have your assumptions challenged. You need to have clear opinions about what you're hearing and experiencing, and to give Russell the feedback he needs to figure out what to do next. You don't have to like or agree with everything he says–I didn't–and when that happened, I told him about it as clearly as I could.

If you are willing to play by these rules, you'll get access to a selection of the very best pianos in the SF bay area, as well as the thoughts and opinions of a person who has decades of experience evaluating pianos and matching them up with the people who are looking for one.

It worked for me, and now I'm the owner of a wonderful piano.

Good luck.</text>< gmapID>

I made an appointment with Russell via email, and then when I showed up, he was cordial and asked me to summarize what I was basically looking for, which I did. He then took me to about 4 or 5 pianos that were in my budget range and asked me play the same thing on all of them, which was a good idea, so I could really tell what was different about each piano. He commented on each of the pianos, explaining why they sounded the way they did. Clearly he's very knowledgeable and passionate about the pianos he carries. I think the best way to describe it is that it was a bit of an "experience", which was pleasant- he was kind of like a tour guide, showing me around the various pianos that he carries. For me, this was the kind of piano shopping experience I hoped to have. He also didn't come across as a high pressure salesperson either.

I believe Russell treats his pianos as one might think of fine wines. He also mentioned to me that he hand-selects many of the pianos he carries, rather than calling the manufacturer and simply saying "Send me another model xyz." So he has a personal connection to them. I think you will have a positive shopping experience if you keep these things in mind:

1) Ask first before playing a particular piano. He keeps the lids closed when they're not being played to keep them in great shape.

2) It's probably better to make an appointment first, rather than just showing up, so that he has the the proper time to show you around while in his shop, and you get his undivided attention.

3) Have some idea of what it is you're looking for & your budget range, but also keep an open mind, trust your ears, & be open to a little piano "education" while you're there. Expect your experience to be different from most of your piano-buying shopping trips.

4) It would also be a good idea to research some of the makes that Russell carries, as many of them are high-end boutique European brands that are top-notch, but may be unfamiliar to the average buyer, such Estonia, Sauter, Steingraeber & Sohne, & Grotrian. If you're a Yamaha lover, this might not be the right place for you.

One more point: I think a good analogy might be that many Americans go and visit France, then come back saying "The French are so rude!" but that's because they expect every French person to speak English to them & they haven't bothered making an effort to do some homework & learn a few key French phrases before making the trip.

Hope that helps.< /review></record>

I have gone shopping to R. Kassman twice now, looking for a piano for my daughter. Both times I had set up an appointment, and both times Russell spent a huge amount of time with my daughter, taking her from piano to piano, letting her play, asking what she liked and did not like about each piano, and explaining what is unique about the various pianos ...  The whole journey was peppered with knowledgable and informative comments from an expert. You can tell that Russell is honing in on the likes and dislikes, and trying to guide you towards pianos that match your tonal preferences. My recommendation: if you are shopping for a piano in the area, do pay them a visit. Go there with some time in hand. The Russell tour is a fun and learning experience.

Compared to the other dealerships that I have visited, they carry a wide assortment of pianos, both budget-friendly pianos and high-end European pianos like Steingraeber, Estonia, Sauter, Grotrian etc that are not easily found in the same store, if at all. My experience so far -- there is no substitute for a side by side comparison of pianos to get a sense what you really like. Going to a store like this helps making an educated decision about what you really like.

Russell's tour is perhaps a bit unorthodox. The other stores I had visited typically asked me what I wanted to try. At Kassman, it is more an exploration of the what various brands have to offer in your budget range, and figuring out what suits your style and tastes. If you are willing to explore and figure out what you like, Kassman is the place to go to.

As another poster noted, this store is probably not the right one if you want to just want to go from piano to piano on your own, and just try them out without having to talk to anyone. This is definitely not the Target / Walmart shopping experience. Personally I do not think we could have gotten as much out of the process if we were left on our own -- but I understand that different people have different preferences. Russell carries high-end expensive pianos, and he keeps them is top notch shape. So I understand if he is protective about them, and prefers the shopping experience to be guided tour. However I should not be speaking for Russell.

One further note: Post-sales service has also been outstanding. There were some initial issues that surfaced over the first year or so, which is apparently not uncommon for new pianos. Although I had been warned that such minor issues could come up, it was a bit unnerving when these problems surfaced. Russell took care of these issues, and made me feel comfortable that I had chosen the right dealer to get the piano from.< /Review>

< review>
My partner and I (I am a professional musician) were welcomed warmly by Mr. Kassman, and we briefly explained what we wanted (I wished to replace my current piano, whose tone I had never liked after many attempts at voicing and other modifications). He then took us through a thorough exploration of piano timbre as exemplified by his exceptional stock of instruments.

We spent over an hour playing at least 9 or 10 instruments until we found a magnificent piano that matched our tonal desires and other needs (responsiveness, size, etc.) Mr. Kassman then offered a significant discount from the list price (which was quite unusual for the brand of instrument we purchased, I learned from my research.) We went home and after several hours of contemplation, contacted him with our decision. He stayed open after his posted hours for our return visit to finalize the purchase.

The remainder of our dealings continued to show Mr. Kassman as a generous, professional, and canny businessman. He wrote a very complete and useful appraisal of my old piano. The moving company he uses provided the most careful and complete piano-moving experience I have ever witnessed (and I've seen MANY!) - they spent a half-hour just polishing the instrument (with the included cleaning kit) after placing it in my studio!

I was also pleasantly surprised that the de-humidifier I had briefly mentioned I wanted had been installed and included in the purchase at no charge. And the technician who provided the initial free tuning and voicing spent over two hours at my home, carefully addressing everything I had noted in my first weeks of playing. I also received a follow up call from Mr. Kassman, who wanted to be sure I was satisfied with my purchase.

In response to some reviews on Yelp: I do believe it is important to research piano-buying in advance of such a major purchase. Purchasing from Kassman Pianos is analogous to a purchase from Tiffany or Saks, not to one from Target or Walmart. There is nothing wrong with the latter stores, but an informed consumer will understand the quality of product and service s/he can expect at Kassman Piano. A high-end jeweler will only allow a few items of value to be perused by a customer at any one time, and other customers are asked to wait or return when they can be helped completely. Such is the expectation one should have when purchasing the highest quality instruments made, which are what Mr. Kassman sells.

In sum, I have been exceptionally pleased with every aspect of my experience with Kassman Pianos, and would not hesitate to recommend Russell and his establishment to any serious buyer of a high quality instrument.</review>

<review>This place has always been the go to place to get your oil change around this area. They're quick, efficient, decently priced, and professional. They always top off all liquids and check air pressure, along with changing your oil.

I don't get my oil changed anywhere else.</review></record></dataset><record>

If your needing your oil changed? This is the place to have it done in Lakeport CA. These guys are fast, friendly, inexpensive and will let you provide your own oil and filter unlike some places who want to charge you for all kinds of things you don't want or need. I recommend them to all my friends and family who come to visit us here in Lake Co. California. Wouldn't have anyone else change my oil regardless of coupons or gemicks they might advertise.< /Review>

Really like this place because I bring my own oil/filter in and they take care of my car, even when I shouldn't bring it in so soon, you see I put high mileage synthetic oil in and would bring my car back at 3000 miles or so and the they that I didn't need to do that, so now I bring it in at 7000 miles or so( we both kinda compromised)😀<//Text>

Rudeness must be the norm here. My second experience with rude, obviously unhappy to be at work, people.  I think everyone is entitled to a bad day but same treatment today. I drove away. Will not be going back.  Making an appt elsewhere.  Gentlemen just not snapping and scouling at people is a good policy, even in a small town</Text>

< review>
Sure, nobody wants to be inspected, but if you had to get one then this would be a good place for it. I pulled in for the inspection and my compliments to the officer, because he asked how I was doing, and when I said I was kind of running a tight schedule trying to get to Hollister to make my delivery on time he said we'll try to get you out of here as quickly as possible and he did just that. Professional and personable would be a couple words to describe the man I had the pleasure of being inspected by. Best. Inspection. Experience. Ever. (That's going back 23 years, too.)

Thanks Koop, I made the delivery on time! It was a positive inspection experience that I won't soon forget!<//review>

<review>These guys are polite, thorough, and quick. If you show them respect, have your permits up to date, keep good logs, do your pretrips well, and have your load weights legal, you shouldn't have any problems coming through here.

<review>Here's the thing...after 47 yr's on the road if you have a problem with these scales you quite likely shouldn't be out on the road....find another way of feeding yourself....foolish remarks on here basically gives yourself away and pretty much indicative of your IQ and skills.<//review>< Pics>

<Name>Redding Post</Name><time>1483554975217</time><rate>5< /rate><text>This scalehouse is known for officers with integrity.  98% of truckers are in/out without a glance; 1% are the drivers who have a correctable trailer weight problem and get out with little problem.  The other 1% are drivers with serious problems with loads, paperwork, or attitudes.  Keep your logs up to date, permits active, and weights correct, and you will have no problem.
Yes, being pulled in for inspection can be frustrating, but CHP is required to perform random inspections.  Again, cooperate and graduate.  Check the attitude, convey respect, and you will be treated with respect and given the green light.< /text>< Pictures>

This one of my favorite thrift shops in the Bay Area! March 24, 2021, yesterday, they were open from 10-1. They had someone at the door checking people in. Only 20 in at one time. It is located in Los Gatos—a high end place.

The thrift store is not very large, but it is filled with lots of amazing treasures. This ia one of the two thrift shops in town. What do you think women in town do with their designer clothes when they are tired of them?

There are shoes and hand bags locked in glass cases And nice ladies will open them for you so you can have closer look. If you are on a close budget—they have blouses for $4. Up high on the wall there are designer jackets that don't look worn. There is a rack of Vintage Clothing, and one of Maternity clothing. There is clothing for children and men, but it seems to me that it is mostly women that will score there. Today, they had a display of dolls that were marked 1/2 off. Need glasses or dishes? They have them. They also have knick knacks and jewelery. If you like reading books—they have a lot, but I didn't have time to check them out.

Last but not least, they have dragons!!! I think you might find one that would make a child happy or the child within jolly! A great place to shop for yourself or someone special. I am sorry that I didn't have more time to shop there. Oh, well, another day…< /Text>

I usually found cheap cool toys, clothing, and my favorite books that my family could afford.
Now I am an hour and a half away and I do make the drive if Im heading that way. Travel before traffic! Plan accordingly they close early.
If you want to show your family and friends a cool town, with food/coffee shops and a stop at the thrift store is always a good start, I suppose.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8wZJZMjA9B3365YpWgmmHAz74QiixBq8QeX1Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

They dont let you go in with strollers.
Their rules. Their reasons. It makes me feel unwelcome for my baby who was sleeping at the time and I couldn't hold him the whole time while I was shopping. Meanwhile a lady next to me taking a look on clothes had a double stroller. I just walked away.<//text>< Rating>

Parking is very difficult to find during certain times of the day. They have a parking lot but it is reserved only for their volunteers. Prices on most things are very affordable unless it's a name brand, then they really mark it up. Store hours are a hit and miss sometimes they are closed for a whole day and you have no way of knowing. Volunteers have been rude, pushy, and very short tempered. Sometimes they are nice, but mostly not very friendly or willing to help. These are all things that if they improved, I would shop more often and probably stay longer. But the atmosphere is not very enjoyable. :-(</Review>

Nice store.  Reasonable prices.  Slow checkout.  This place has many treasures and lots of choices.  A small place, but packed to the gills.  You will enjoy finding something here and helping out the cause.   I believe all who work there (or at least most) are volunteers.  Close walking distance from the main street in Los Gatos you will enjoy the walk.  Check it out when you are in Los Gatos, CA.  Sorry they don't sell cats.</review>

<review>Poor selection, with any high ticket items priced through eBay, which kind of ruins the fun of a thrift store. Main reason for one star though was how they were treating a customer who had brought her service dog in, the customer was clearly not at 100 percent mentally, as evidenced by the very loud, uncomfortable argument the decrepit clerk was having with her in the middle of the crowded store. Regardless of what you think of service animals/comfort animals, they are allowed by law to accompany their mentally ill owners into places just like any other service animal, so it really stuck in my craw that the angry old clerk was yelling at this woman (who clearly needed an emotional support animal) about how "We don't allow dogs in the store!" She even threatened to call the police. That's friendly service if I ever saw it (not)</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

You would think if you're volunteering to help a place out you would be happy but seems every single time I've ever gone to donate or even make a purchase here the volunteers are so extremely rude I literally grab my donation bags and walked out. Also you would think for being in Los Gatos this place wouldn't be so grimey and Dusty and stinky and gross but it really is I would rather drive 40 miles to the nearest donation center then to drive 2 blocks and donate anything at this place ever again. I truly believe that anyone that gives this place more than one star must be friends with the person who owns it or volunteers because this place sucks so bad.<//Review>< Time>

There's nothing like a thrift shop in an affluent town, this is a true spot for treasure hunting, get an Armani blazer for $10 or grab some fine china for dirt cheap. They have electronics, shoes, and kids clothes galore. It's very tiny and the staff is 100% volunteer. The majority of them are elderly, so service is not that great, but the finds are. They have two dressing rooms and horrible parking. Hours are limited, and you would be best to bring your own bags. The store is 100% charitable as they fund EMQ childrens counseling services for Santa Clara county.</review>

<Text>My wife went into the store with our five week old baby. As her mother walked through the store, my wife pushed the stroller with the baby and sat down in a chair sat out for customers in the back of the store.  With a cloth completely hiding the act of feeding our child a women came over that worked in the store.

The women told my wife in a very dominant fashion that there are no strollers allowed in the store.  My wife who is very pleaseant and hard to rattle said “I’m sorry I was just sitting for a moment to feed the baby.” The women then proceeded to tell my wife that “I guess it’s time for you to go home than.”

As my wife put the baby in the stroller and proceeded to leave as requested.  This elderly women could not help but to take one more jab at my wife by saying “I said there are no strollers allowed in the store.”

My wife said politely as she always does, “I just need to get to the front door”  and then my wife sat out front in 90 degree heat until her mother who did not hear any of the conversation finished shopping.

I always try to realize there are always things going on in people’s lives that cause them to be angry that has nothing to do with the moment their anger and judgement comes pouring out onto others.  I only wish it did not happen to my my wife who is a wonderful women and mother and wife.  I hope by posting this story it won’t happen to anyone else in the future.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808e35fa6d001ac7:0x579fc399fb0d8388</gmapID></record>

Told me to get out of the store with a stroller (even almost nobody was there), that they do not accept strollers there. No sign on the door!
With babies, you are not welcome because with a carrier you can not try on clothes or carry your purchase. And I already have clothes for about 70$ for purchase, but they even did not let me finish my shopping there. Very unsatisfied!<//Review>

A small little local thrift store with cheap prices. We didn't find the toddler clothes we were looking for, but ended up buying some kid's games and toys instead.<//Review>

Ok so the bartender lady was super nice, upbeat and a ball of sunshine. Then the guy came in... he was snappy with her, and we can see he made her feel uncomfortable. I watched him slip cookies in his mouth then slide his mask back up, straight from the cookie/ muffins for sale.. then he remade a batch of coffee and when the lady served me it was filled with coffee grinds and she had to clean the container, and machine, and make me a new batch to fix the situation. The food was pre-made breakfast burritos or oatmeal and to think this food was sitting wasn't comfortable knowing a 6 hr flight you could get the squirts in a bathroom the size of a locker....<//review>

<Review>Other than friendly waitresses and nice ice cold water I was a bit disappointed...what type of restaurant only has two items "on the menu"? And then when my husband got his burger it wasn't on a brioche bun as the menu said.  Chips no flavor, burger fine. Definitely sad we didn't realize there were no restaurants in the terminals (other than this).<//Review>< Name>

<Text>Terrible service. I asked for a menu and they would’ve give it to me. He told me they had chicken tenders or a cheese burger. I got a cheese burger and it came with lettuce tomato pickles and mayo. This was not told to me. I am allergic to mayo so I could not even eat it. Very upsetting. Will not be dinning here again.<//Text><rate>1< /rate><pictures>None< /pictures><GmapID>0x80deab161457878f:0xd0f5913466b408bb<//GmapID>< Date>

Eat BEFORE security for gates 11-20 or you’ll experience price gouging so bad it should be illegal because you’ll likely be forced to eat at this place. They don’t have a menu with prices posted anywhere and you’ll be told to take your pick between chicken fingers or a basic cheeseburger which will hit your wallet for $16. Want tots instead of chips? That’ll be another $3.  And you want a drink?  Congrats you just paid $25 for a $7 meal.  This is NOT gourmet food, but they'll charge you like it is. And BTW, they’re out of most the condiments. AVOID eating here. Eat before security or go to another set of gates if you have time.<//text>

Only had two menu items available: hamburger or chicken fingers. I got the hamburger which was okay. The chips that came with it were unseasoned. The service was really friendly but slow. Prices were very high for the meh quality food. Would definitely not eat here again.</Text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>As airport food goes, Urban Crave is pretty good. I wouldn't go out of my way for this if it were outside of an airport I fly out of 3-4 times per month. But, as far as breakfast is concerned, this is a decent spot previously in Terminal 2 of SAN and now in Terminal 1. A Bloody Mary and the "Yuppie Wrap" was my usual Monday 6am meal before they moved to Terminal 1. The Yuppie Wrap is a wrap that contains bacon, eggs, cheese, avocado, and fries.  (Kudos to them for not trying to claim this is a burrito.) I usually hold the fries -- not for taste reasons -- but because it makes the wrap too heavy for my first meal of the work week.

When I've flown out of SAN in non-morning hours (which is rare), I've ordered the chili hot dog, which is humongous and also decent -- better than most pub hot dogs.

Best yet, none of Urban Crave's food has resulted in an unfortunate lavatory visit during any of my long trans-con flights.

My biggest complaint about this place is that it is slightly over-priced, even for airport restaurants. Given the lack of reasonable alternatives, I deal with it.

If you like your Bloody Marys spicy, be sure to tell them that when you order.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgEZta2VwcHU1eVaX9LWwZjuU93pPhPHh2Zmq3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiDs9Q41fdtz_JACMuRSp2-xvlVH3Df5ry9qrf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPK8p7XAw1h2DWIK2SYXkW_it83TwqRyqEBUEcD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCe4KD4RhCZ0C4Om_D6B8WwVtwP6VF_ao9P1bj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFioW_TfKcHQlMi1KIuWUHCLuGKhPAMs6fkvk1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvEb4MEuk5r0YtOJk8YlOsx_wtq0spMlj9KpDK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLbsd0EWAg9wWMABIS3kusBqM-VpFUJB5CSndd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBh95mVbdhGwQcfUup4bIn2e0x41NvfgEsASOh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyGCAR1d-ZfQdsaR13BfDLqsi-Uh4Oce7mPqWO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

It was crowded and there were only two people working the front.  After forty minutes my mother went up to the counter and asked if she could order. The bartender screamed loudly at her that it wasn’t his job.  When we finally got our food it was bland, soggy, and over priced.  Whoever runs this place needs a new career.< /review>

<Text>I asked the server if the cheese fries came that nacho sauce and was told no. This is was I received and it wasn't very good. It tastes like chip dip. Also, my partner ordered the chili dog and the server asked what side we wanted and we said we would take the cheese fries with the chili dog. When we inquired about the extra charge we received for the side, the server said she heard us talking about how we wanted them and she was just trying to give us a deal by combining them. Then the server played dumb when we said we understood her to be offering us the side, not trying to make a good deal for us. This place has a cool decor but for the price and quality of food, I'd go to the BBQ place on the other side of the terminal.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO583RkQiGRppgzprbt4fFBUFbR1cyCXFNcSccR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80deab161457878f:0xd0f5913466b408bb<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>When my flight was delayed and I received a food voucher, I was excited to try Urban Crave. I decided on a lighter meal and ordered the Cobb Salad.
First impression was that there was nearly more protein than veg with the egg, chicken and bacon. Second impression was that the veg was far, far from fresh. In fact, I got a bite that was so bitter (it may have been the onions) that I had to spit it out!
I would've done better to go to the kiosk and get a yogurt parfait.< /Text><Rate>1<//Rate>< time>

<Review>After a long week of running a convention, lunch at Urban Crave while waiting for our flight home was the perfect match. Cedar, our server, was excellent. He got it all right, and with a great personality to go with it. The burgers were incredible, and the tots hit the spot. We never thought eating at an airport burger bar would be so tasty...and the Oktoberfest paired with it was icing on the cake!< /Review></record>

<review>Food was cool but poor customer service. I ordered food this morning as I waited to board my flight home. I only had 20 minutes until boarding. Food was done in 10. Cool I had time to eat it at my gate before I boarded. Before I checked my food I asked the cashier for salt and pepper. She tells me there isn't any and that I would have to use the salt and pepper shakers. I grabbed my food to check it to make sure my order was correct and before I was able to do so the cashier tells me I can't sit here and eat. I tell her I wasn't going to and that I was about to board my flight. I felt so uncomfortable I decided not to check my food nor put salt and pepper on it. I just left. No matter how hungry I am next time I will not spend any money with this establishment.< /review><time>1572146714740<//time><GmapID>0x80deab161457878f:0xd0f5913466b408bb<//GmapID><Name>Jeremy Jacob<//Name>< user>

<review>I waited almost 20-30 minutes before my first interaction with the staff. I was waited on after 6 people who got there after me.

The food is nothing special. The prices are ridiculously 50% more than the same item at a different front. How is an "Old Fashion" $20 here but $10-$12 elsewhere?

I wanted to tip $0 but it wouldn't have been fair to all the rest of the staff.

This place really should not be in business. People would be served better at Pete's coffee just behind the wall. This place should be gone and replaced.< /review>< Pics>

We had the American breakfast whole while waiting for our flight. Just what I like for breakfast.  Eggs, sausage, hash browns and toast. Oh, a Jack and 7 double too! Service was just right with no wait for a table! Good to get some decent food before a long travel day.</Review>

I'm a big breakfast person and I'm not a picky person at all either. However today, literally 30 minutes ago, I had the most disgusting, most horrible breakfast at Urban Crave at the San Diego International Airport at gate 11. I ordered The Classic American, I asked for my eggs to be medium well however the eggs turned out to be not only super runny but the yolk was cold I am not exaggerating! The tater tots were smashed together, it looked like a dysfunctional hash brown and had a terrible bland taste. I pray to God I don't get sick throughout my flight. The only pleasant experience was my waitress she was very nice.< /Text>

My sister and I stopped by while we were waiting for a flight... shocking since we’re at the airport. Anyway, we sat at a table waiting thinking a server would come by to take our order. Several minutes went by and no one came, so I went to the bar to order. At the bar several people made eye contact with me and just walked past. Finally I flagged someone down and asked to order some beer. He rudely told me that if I was sitting at a table someone would come to me. Ten minutes later I went to the Pete’s coffee because I was sick of waiting. While I was walking back with my coffee a server finally walked up and asked my sister if she wanted to order something. This place sucks!!<//Text>

<Review>We went to this restaurant for dinner before our flight.  We were rushed by the waitress after stating the kitchen was closing, so we quickly ordered.  We ordered two house margaritas without looking closely at the price.  When we left we saw that each margarita was $20.  Are you kidding me!  I realize things at the airport are more expensive, but this is airport robbery!</Review><rate>1<//rate>< date>

After traveling all day, found this great spot and the bartender, well amazing. I wish I really got his name, I apologize it I got it wrong, but maybe Chris... Anyway, great conversation and next time I am in the SD airport, may need to just stop by for another great conversation on Ireland. Thanks man, needed it after my day.<//Review>

Although they charge $20 for a burger and a handful of chips they're pretty good. The price is a bit much tho.. if they had better prices I'd give more stars..yes I understand they're in the airport but still..<//Review>

Oh my dear dying jesus! If I'm going to pay almost 20 bucks for a drink PUT SOME ALCOHOL IN IT!  Food was not bad, I had the quesadilla, it was acceptable. I will remember to bring nips along with me next time. My waitress was really nice. I felt bad for her because one of her tables left without paying. What's wrong with people?<//Text>

<Review>Cheapest beers in airport I think. We went to 4 places and this was self pour for 58cents per Oz so a 22oz was cheaper than every place we went.
Also love not having to wait for server to fill beer as you self serve and if you need them there’s a pager button on the table!

<Review>Very expensive, even for the convenience of the airport. I'd have been ok with the menu prices if the food was more organic and less processed. To be clear, I was not expecting "organic" to be stated, but I also wasn't expecting chicken that appeared to have been previously frozen and reheated! The meal was subpar for the price. The service however, was exceptional! But the food offerings - my own meal and those of others seated nearby - were lacking in presentation and in my case, tasty satisfaction as well. Not worth the high price of eating close to the gate.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Pretty busy but great service and great food, had a burger with chips which was fresh and well presented. Definitely recommended, not that many other places to eat at that terminal so it was a nice surprise.</text>

People working were prompt enough but the cleanliness of the menus and outermost tables left a lot to be desired. Burger wasn’t gross but utterly flavorless, same for the “aioli spread” and “guacamole”.  Fries would’ve been acceptable had it not been for the $25 bill I paid. I’m gonna go ahead and say it’s a better idea to find the time to stop at an In N Out, Jack in the Box or Chick Fil A before coming to this terminal.<//Text>

The spirit airlines of airport restaurants. Waited an hour for our food. Our server stopped checking on us so I found the manager. He was rude when I suggested it had been an hour since we ordered. I then showed him the receipt on our table that had the time on it when the order was placed...he then returned with cold food and almost as if to mock us, said "hope everything is hot and fresh!" The food, the service and especially that manager with the glasses is below 1 star.<//Review>

<text>Once you pass Security at Terminal-1, this is the only option for hot food. My waitress was good. The hamburger was listed as Angus; she asked me for my preference and I asked if the burger was fatty. She nodded yes so I ordered Medium rather than M-rare. After what seemed a long wait she brought me the burger Well-done.  She offered to try again. I ate it because I didn’t want to wait another 15-20 minutes for whatever would come back. I left her a $5 cash tip so that the restaurant wouldn’t take a split.< /text><user>100914154398551764809< /user></record></dataset><record>

The SD airport should be ashamed of allowing the business to stay open. They’re rude and disrespectful to say the least. Over priced for the quality of food. 35.00 for two sandwiches this is crazy. Your only option for a warm meal in this terminal is this establishment unfortunately. They claim to be a street style food.  I’ve had great street food and this is no way close to that. That would be setting the bar high for them. I would compare it to the lunch that my 5 year old child would make for me.  If I didn’t have low blood suger at the time I would not placed the order.<//text>

We stopped here for breakfast because we had a little bit of time before our flight and were pleasantly surprised. The service was quick and cheerful and the food was excellent! You can't beat this place as far as airport food.< /review>

My friend and I stopped to eat in there before our flight. It was the worst sandwich I had ever had in my life. We ordered the chicken sandwich. The bread was burnt and the chicken herb mush tasted like a greasy grill and nothing else. We could not taste the chicken or herbs. Even though we were starving and that was our breakfast we gave up after a few bits. When we complained, the waitress just said "oh" and walked off. And to top our frustration we still had to pay full price (which is way over priced). Now as we sit for our plane to board we both feel nauseous.

In short I would not recommend this place and if you do go, then don't get the chicken sandwich.</Review>

Second time dining here -- not a fan of the food.  It's bland and unimpressive.  Anyone who's flown through terminals 3-10 knows how AWESOME bankers hill is.  If San Diego Airport knew what was good for them, they'd cut out 30th Street and Urban Crave and replace them with Bankers Hill, they'd be GOLDEN.  For drinks, it's okay... but if you need a meal - build enough time into your airport trip that you can go to terminal 3-10. (Or eat before you come!)< /text>

While I was waiting for my food to be ready an empty seat opened up at the bar so I sat down. The server behind the bar asked me if he could help me with anything. I mentioned I was waiting for my food. He asked me to leave the bar area because there were other customers looking for a seat. Mind you the other customers were a party, not an individual and my seat was solely one. I felt embarrassed and discriminated as I too was a paying customer, but I didn’t deserve a seat. Horrible service and food.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I was appalled by this place. While waiting for my flight this morning, I ordered breakfast here. Three employees started talking about how they had their guns ready and that they were going to use them on Democrats and liberals. This is in an airport and on work hours. I don't know if that conversation was meant to intimidate, but I will never eat here again.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Bartender can't do math or was trying to be sneaky. I gave Jonathan $12 in cash and asked the rest to be on my card. I paid the amount owed, and then he came up saying he charged me under by $10. I didn't think much of it but than my card was charged $22. The $12 in cash was never put in the till until i spoke up about being over charged by $12 if I had been under charged by only $10. After a while he gives me only $10 back.

Had I not caught this error I was going to be charged just shy of $60 for two bottled beers and nachos.

Keep an eye on this bartender. This was a super shady experience.<//Review>< name>

<Review>What a pain these guys are. First they argue about 5 subbing bacon for avocado and then charge me more. Oh and then they forget to add the avocado anyway. I'm on the plane, without what I ordered, down $20. Seriously. Will be challenging this on my card statement. And I hope they refund my card immediately. Disgusting that they take advantage of customers and don't take care of their food. Awful place. Unhelpful staff.< /Review><user>105478157597668290600< /user>< pics>

Very quick service at 5:39 am. The breakfast burritos are made fresh as you order. I got mine in 4 minutes!

I had the Chorizo Wrap which was very flavorful and not so big that I would be bloated afterward. Just enough to tide me over on a 3 hour flight.

Quality-wise it's way better than what you would expect from airport food. I would actually seek this out in the free world if this chain wasn't just in airports.

The price was a little strong at $14, but what do you expect when they have a captive audience. Hands down the best damn $14 breakfast burrito I've ever had though.<//Review>

the food is very good  but the customer service really is terrible   specially if you are an employee of the airport, they attend you last and make you wait and wait and wait for your order and ignore you. The last time  I PAYED 27DLLS for several orders  and I ask for more  sauce  and the waiter literally say to me  WAIT  BECAUSE I NEED TO ATTEND A CUSTOMER FIRST...??? Then What Am I.??? This is at the Urban Crave near gate 49.</text>

We have had good and bad experiences here.  The food is pretty good - for airport food.  The BLT sandwich (which has been discontinued) was fantastic!  Breakfast is alright.  It's really the only place to eat (except cold sandwiches and snacks) in the terminal.<//review>

<review>Awful SAN airport trap restaurant.  Way overpriced. Pint of beer was $11, but without a live NFL game to entertain me. BBQ pork slider  ($14) was mostly fatty gristle, stuff that would even make Oscar Meyer gag. At least server was nice.  Unfortunately place does a brisk business and will probably continue to snag unsuspecting travelers forever.< /review>< pics>

Great place to grab a beer when all the other seates taken. Small terminal so I would post up here and grab a bite while you wait.<//review>

<review>First off - WAY overpriced!!!
Burgers close to $20 plus fries $3. Bloody mary close to $20. Total, two burgers, one with fries, two beers, one bloody mary $81 plus tip!!
Food was very average as was the service. Will never go back. Totally not worth the price. I should have read the reviews - my mistake.< /review>< response>

<review>Service was horrible. I sat down it, sever made eye contact sever times but did not come over, I asked person at bar of there was a server where I was sitting, assuming I wasn’t in their section, she said yes. The same server who made eye contact more than once came over I asked if they had tea. Server snarkly said yeah sure and rolled her eyes and gave me a dirty look. I told her not to worry about it because her attitude sucked. I asked to speak the the manager, explained the situation and all he could say was he was aware she has a bad attitude. As a manager that was an unacceptable answer.<//review></record>

It’s always a horrible disappointment when airport restaurants are a rip-off, but the prices here are just disgraceful. If you’re going to charge $18 for a cocktail, the least you could do is have a clean counter to enjoy it on for a few minutes.<//text>

First of all, it took 30 minutes to get 2 burgers. We had to change from eating there to getting it to go. The burgers were ok but needed some seasoning. And they give you Hunts ketchup? Come on. The chips were also not even salted (watched them make them). Lastly for a place that calls itself "street food" to not have tacos in San Diego is just not right. A turkey bacon club is not street food. Service was friendly though.< /text>

Went to San Diego to visit my son on base and on our way home this was one of the few places that sounded decent. Were we wrong. We ordered 2 nachos and a sliders to go. They said 10min.... 20 min later they were finally done with the nachos but they had put it in a dine in bowl. As we said take out they proceeded to turn it upside-down into the to go box putting cheese, dips, meat, etc on the bottom. Then told us the sliders weren't done. They apparently hadn't even started them. 5min later we finally had all our food. Nachos were soggy, cold, and a mess. Pulled pork sliders I wouldn't even call sliders. Meat was dry but the bottom bun was liquid. They seem to have put 3 buns in, a small amount of dry meat, then liquid coleslaw on top. Never eating there again.< /Review>

I really wished I had seen other reviews before I ordered an old fashioned. It was not a good old fashioned and on top of it, it cost $20.45. Seriously? What kind of whiskey or bourbon are you putting in here that it costs double to $4 more than other pricey locations? Talk about holding you hostage just for a drink.</review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Their classic burger was $17 and about five stars below a McDonald's big mac. They charge extra for fries ($3) too... Oh and they didn't give me fries either and charged me anyways. Burger was cold and came with none of the toppings from the menu, had to send it back. Total joke of a restaurant that preys on passengers stuck in a terminal with only one sit down eatery option. Should have read the reviews before I wasted my time there. Go to Panda Express or McDonald's if you want classic American food. At least they hold themselves accountable.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

It’s been over 20 minutes and I still haven’t found someone to serve me. Customer services is beyond horrible. I stopped one lady to ask if someone will be serving me and she gave me the most irritable look ever. Like she couldn’t believe that I dare asked to be served! Meanwhile all the servers are just walking around chit chatting amongst each other as if they were in a public bar and not work. Wouldn’t recommend this place.<//text>

<Review>It's ridiculously expensive, even for a place that's inside the airport.  My husband and I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries each and nothing else.  We paid $51!!!  Service is slow (we waited around 30 minutes for our order, even when we ordered to-go).  The taste of food is ok, but my burger was cold.  Not going back!<//Review>< date>

Super duper overpriced, even for an airport. This was the ONLY restaurant in this terminal, and they do not offer a kids menu. This was so frustrating as most of the patrons seemed to have kids, and not all kids will eat hot dogs (their only suggestion for us). Beers were $11 a pint and the food was okay, not worth the price. Also because kids aren't allowed to sit at the bar, we were left stalking other patrons who were eating, some who seemed to have staked out a chair and weren't leaving for hours. It seems like the staff could do a better job of moving them along (they would make more $$ too!).< /review>

They said no, but the servers can and pointed at them huddled in the corner on the other side of the restaurant. Went up to them; still didn’t see my server. They said they couldn’t help me. Only my server could.

Had to wait another 15min to pay my bill. Isn’t that what ticket identification numbers are for?

Wouldn’t surprise me if Urban Crave had to compensate someone’s flight for this issue.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Got a chardonnay and burger for 33.00. I feel like it was over priced. They asked me how I wanted my burger cooked and I said medium well. It was cooked well. Why ask of you're going to do what you want anyways. Also the waitress was way more concerned about drinks than getting my food to me. I think I saw it sit on the other side of the country for 5 minutes cooling before I got her attention and asked her to bring it to me, but there really wasn't and bell or alert either to tell her it was ready.  I felt like there was a real break down between the front of house and the kitchen.<//Review>

How can you even call this place a bar/restaurant? Menu is obsolete and contains multiple items missing or not available anymore. Poor service even by airport standards. These terminals should be open to provide more food and drink options to be fair<//Text>

You gotta be kidding me with this food. There is zero vegetarian option whatsoever in the only restaurant in the whole terminal for gates 11-18. My wonderful waitress hooked me up with some kind of hybrid egg sandwich in an effort to help (props to Bianca). The sandwich arrived with raw jalapenos that they hadn't even bothered to de-seed so it was inedibly spicy. SAN should probably consider other concessions vendors  for this terminal .< /text>

Only bar in this terminal. $11 for a shot of Evan Williams. I got the nachos once and it was just goopy cheese sauce on a tiny plate of store-bought tortilla chips with some boiled chicken cubes. I guess it is the airport though, but it is still pretty sad when the food and drinks on the plane are cheaper and tastier.<//review>

Total rip o . More expensive than drinks on the deck at the dell Coronado. Rediculous.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

At first i was happy with how fast my order came out but then i soon noticed that my order was most likely a simple repackage of someone else’s order. Everything was cold so it was obviously left out for awhile. Wish i could give 0< /Review>

<Review>Lucky for them there isn’t any other food option. If your gate is 11-18 at the original terminal of the airport, I would suggest you eat anything before getting through TSA.  The food was overpriced and greasy. The only thing that is worse than the food is the service.
I was here for breakfast.  My coffee wasn’t delivered until my food arrived and the waitress said they had no butter or jelly for the toast and yet other servers were handing out butter and jelly.
You could’ve been just my server, but the attitude was like she didn’t even want to be working.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><userid>109293038349290147402<//userid></record>

Got the bahn mi sandwich... It was slightly bland flavor-wise, although the meat is good, pretty small, and cost $16. Not really worth it, but the terminal didn't really have much option in hot food. It's not that it tastes bad, but hard to justify the cost.< /review>

I am almost angry that this place claims to serve globally inspired fare in a supposed Urban environment. Food is awful and service it's only slightly better. The only concept going on here is raping decent customers of hard earned dollars #metoo and serving bad food in old pie tins.< /review>

Awful and over-priced. Bland burger, side of bland coleslaw and bad customer service. That will be $20 please. Do yourself a favor and get a $10 sandwich from Peet’s or the little market place.</Review>

I loved the burger!! It was a few months ago now but stopped there at the airport and so glad to have eaten there! I got the biggest/juiciest burger. The $$$ is nuts BUT so is everything at the airport I guess. I think it was like $15 for just the burger. The fries were just ok; but overall I would eat there again when/if I'm there. 👍🏼</text>

Lots of complaints here but I had a decent experience. Of course it's over-priced. It's in an airport terminal and there's no competition. What do you expect? Banh Mi was alright w/ fries, Stone IPA on tap. Good pre-flight meal.<//Review>

<Text>The food and drinks are incredibly overpriced for the quality. The service is terrible, but at least that's understandable because the servers are overworked and shorthanded. The only reason they are in business is because airport passengers have no other choice for a bar. Stick with the beer; they can't mess that up.</Text><date>1499189547907< /date><resp>None< /resp>< rate>

<review>Waiting 10min. at a table then go to the bar for a menu a older short lady who I guess is a server tosses another menu onto the table sliding into my lap.While I was waiting at the table an older couple sits down at the next table and with in minutes had a menu and offered if they want water or coffee.. 10mins after that some guy with a black polo with the company name and glasses on his head asks what did I want. I requested coffee then was told I can only get coffee at the bar... But I want food too... any ways by the time it looks like they are starting to get my house coffee my flight starts to boarding. Unfortunately if you don't look like a rich vacationer freshly back from a Caribbean cruise you won't get decent service in the 45min I had for service.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80deab161457878f:0xd0f5913466b408bb<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Very expensive mediocre food.
Pork in bahn mi was pretty dry.
The chicken tenders we're basically big chicken nuggets. The meat inside was very processed chicken and not like a cut off of a chicken.< /review>

Perhaps the worst, most extremely expensive banh mi I've ever had. I saw all of the terrible reviews, so I can't say I wasn't warned, however they are basically the only game in town! This terminal is a scam. The choice is between this restaurant, and prepackaged items. GET THE CHEAP LOOKING PREPACKAGED FOOD. I am sure it will not be good, but it will definitely be better than the awful food that seems to come out of this place (street food? not even close). You will regret it, just like I do. And your wallet will be so much happier. Banh mi = about $18 dollars after tax. In reality it was more like a bad pulled pork sandwich, slathered in mayo and tiny bits of pickled vegetables, and a few sad slices of jalepeno. Good luck, the food choices in this terminal suck.</Text>

Only craving you'll have is to be anywhere else.  God knows they're only in business due to lack of any competition.
Atmosphere:  Crowded, as expected for the sole terminal eatery.  No blame here.
Selection:  Despite the name, there's nothing outside of your typical American grill fare.  Such a shame for a city known being a foodie hotspot.  Hardly anything for lighter meals.
Presentation:  Has the brilliant idea to serve everything on the same pie trays, whether it be sides, apps, or entrees.  Points for nostalgia if you've been to prison.
Food:  I had the fried chicken strips and side salad.  Chicken was processed as hell, pretty sure was frozen prepared, and not freshly fried at all.  Fries were soggy.  I'd be happier if I had gotten McDonald's.  Salad was alright.
Service:  Not especially attentive.  Could of used some more waiters for how busy it was.
Price:  'Hurt me' airport prices as expected.
Conclusion- if you really want to eat in T1, bring some takeout through TSA.< /text></record>

<Review>Bahn Mi was horrible and didn't come with the jalapeno slaw. The meat was most likely boiled in it's own juices and the bread was not actually toasted. It had black bits but far from being called toasted.

Flight delay and needed supper.. alternative staff,  healthy options, a lil pricey but location has a lot to so with that... our Server, Lauren L was attentative, not pushy and never felt like we were lingering as we waited for our delayed flight....also accessible charging stations.  It could have been a 5 with a more artistic menu, but selection were hot upon arrival and tasty. If in the San Diego airport killing time on 2nd fl... worth the extra cost...< /text>

This place is horrible. The food is extremely mediocre for the price and the service is just okay. I am disappointed this is the only option for sit down food and alcohol in this terminal. Plus we are indoors and I'm curios as to why a fly is buzzing around in here. I would not recommend wasting your time and money- bring a snack!< /Review>

I’m giving this review one star because the management of Urban Crave needs to get a grasp on how to run a restaurant.

The ordering process was terrible. I had to repeat my order to the cashier about 3 times. In the middle of ordering the cashier walked away and bagged up another order. Then, after waiting 25+ mins for a plain hamburger and chicken quesadilla and seeing it sit under a heat lamp for 10 mins I come to find that the order was wrong.< /Text>

<Review>Almost the only choice to eat in this terminal. We were told to sit anywhere we wanted and our waitress arrived promptly. Sriracha Mary's were ordered and brought out relatively quickly (and are delish) but they are slow in the kitchen and the folks next to us who ordered after us, received their food first, ours not arriving until much, much later. The food was cold and everything was tasteless! Including the quesidilla and guacamole, very surprising! They allowed a dog to walk in on leash and sit under a table... A little surprising..</Review><gmapID>0x80deab161457878f:0xd0f5913466b408bb<//gmapID>< user>

This is the only place to eat gates 12-18 I believe, it's ok , good Bar, friendly service, if you're expecting a lot , don't, it's the airport. I see some bad reviews and can't believe people's expectations of a place that really should be last resort, or that it's expensive. This place is inside the TSA security check point, eat somewhere else if you have high expectations.</Text>

<text>The worst experience ever. My husband asked for the manager because he wanted to let her know that thay are really pricey and they take advantage of that they are the only place to eat in the terminal so they can charge $17.95 for a burger and the manager had the guts to tell us that if we don't want to pay just don't go to sea world or any other place in San Diego and that if we go to a movie theater and pay $7 for a popcorn we can pay $17 for a burger while the cashier where laughing at us. She was really rude and disrespectful. I don't want to see her face again.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Airport terminal food serving burgers, sandwiches and salad. Service was prompt. Food was decent but pricey even for airports. I guess being monopoly has its advantages.< /review>

<Text>Horrible service. We arrived and sat for 45 minutes before we got our "just above room temperature" food. Others got served ahead of usnober and over. But -- they offered a 10% discount. No thanks. The food was not anywhere near great and the charge to eat there wasnt worth what they provided.  Never eating here again.<//Text>< user>

They have no vegetarian entrees to start with, and then they charge the same overpriced cost for a chicken quesadilla without the chicken and won't allow substituting the chicken for avocado like they used to. Now they want $2 more for the avocado, even if you're not getting chicken. There's no way avocado costs more than chicken, they're just being difficult.</text>

They have no real vegetarian options and only one good beer.  The waitresses hustle though, and leave the check before you are finished so you can board easily.<//review>

No vegetarian options at all.
Layout is not really conducive to table service, just get your stuff to go, it'll be a lot faster.</Review>

Just horrible. Small, pre-made burrito that's been sitting under a heat lamp far too long for $15. Make sure you have an aisle seat on your flight. You're going to be up and down more than a few times.< /review>

I absolutely love this place. My mom put me on to this place about 2 years ago and I haven’t left since. Check out Linda because she definitely has skills. Especially when it comes to getting your bangs done. Never a bad experience.<//Review>

Very good haircut at a great price. Could save yourself some time if you call ahead of time and make an appointment with someone. If it's your first time, go ahead and walk in and see the first person available. They are all pretty well experienced.<//review>

I'm a 30s male and always get my haircut here.  It's relatively cheap and fast.  I've gone with Ruby, Jack and Ken and they're all great.  They take their time to make sure your hair is good, they'll offer a quick rinse and gel it up afterwards too<//Text>

<review>Great cuts at a good price. I got a women's short A line inverted bob (no wash) for $18. It took about 25 mins. A wash would be about $5 more. I never have a problem getting a same day appt, usually within the hour.

This is an all Chinese staff but they all speak English well, but with an accent. They accept credit cards, but I always pay them in cash because they are a small business and I want them to keep their low prices.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< date>

<review>NOTE: Men's Review.

I came to this place after the last shop I went to closed down. I can only say that they are amazing. There is little to no wait time (not sure about women's). Ken is usually the guy who cuts my hair, and I sometimes think this dude once mastered in some martial art. The way he cuts my hair is so high energy. He has great precision and sense of style. The only way I can picture it is like if he was playing Fruit Ninja like a professional, except that he was only cutting hair. Haven't had a complaint in years. I normally prefer Ken mainly for his slick moves, but everyone else here has cut my hair before and they are all great.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Try as I might, I couldn't avoid a hair trim much longer as my hair was soon looking like overgrown weeds. Upon recommendation from a good friend I decided to check out Silver Scissors. The infamous Kathy was booked for the day (even though it was Wednesday) so I decided to go with Ruby. I like the fact that this is a no frills salon and my stylist didn't spend the whole time making small talk. My hair and touch up was $60+ tip. However after coming home I did feel that my haircut was unevenly layered and not blended in as some chunks of hair was hanging more heavily than others, probably since she used a RAZOR to cut my hair! I returned the next week and Ruby fixed it for me, free of charge. However my search continues for a salon to call my own!</Review>

< review>
I actually rarely get my hair cut because I like growing my hair long. If necessary, I usually ask my mom to trim my hair for me or I do it myself. The only times I have ever been to a professional hair cutting studio was when I was in Taiwan. But this summer, my long hair was bother me a lot. My friend recommended this place to me, and I quickly made an appointment. I specifically requested Kathy to cut my hair, (and she is really busy!) so I had to wait a few days before I could be squeezed in. (I was actually wanting Veronica Miller to cut my hair, but when I gave her a call, she was incredibly rude and demeaning. Thankfully Kathy was super sweet!)

Silver Scissors is in the same lot as Chuck E. Cheese's. There's plenty of parking, so if you do come during busy hours, you should be able to secure a spot. Even though I had scheduled an appointment, I had to wait about 20 minutes before Kathy was finished with the client before me. When I walked in, I actually had no clue as to who Kathy was, so I pretty much sat there until somebody called me over. There was a good amount of people waiting in the waiting area - maybe about 5 to 6, but there were about 4-5 stylists cutting hair, so wait doesn't get too long.

I was a bit nervous, seeing as how it had been a long time since getting my hair cut, but everybody was super chill and accommodating. After getting my hair washed , I told Kathy how many inches I wanted to cut off and gave her some clue as to how I wanted my hair to be cut - I honestly didn't know myself. She did a really good job though, and wiped away all of my nerves. I asked for a layered haircut that would be able to frame my face. It seemed like she cut away a lot of hair, but I was really happy with the end result. And then she blew dried my hair for a long time, adding finishing touches, before somebody else took over with the blow drying. At the end, she came back and added some special hair lotion. I was pretty darn happy!

A hair wash, cut and blow dry styled hair came out to be $18 I believe. I think that's a great price! Will definitely be back to get my hair cut with Kathy!< /review>

I've been coming here for about a year getting my hair cut every 3 weeks or so. Jack has been with me the whole way through 3 different styles and finally finding a professional style that is convenient to maintain and fits my facial features well.< /text>

<Review>A week today I visited this salon to get a blow dry and style I called and the lady that answered told me that the price was 15 dollars for what I wanted so I went in and asked her the same question in person for she gave me the same answer 15 dollars. When I let down my hai for her to wash it she said oh my good your hair is pretty long. She started to blow the bottom section and styling it the way I wanted then she stopped and said that she gave the wrong price the for my length of hair they charge 18 I said that it was fine she looked irritated. After she was done with the bottom section she stopped curling it she got the curling iron and she started to curl it with that instead I told her that I wanted my whole hair to be styled with the blow dryer she said that it was to much and she had to leave I told her I don’t like what you are doing to my hair she didn’t listen. I finally had enough and asked her for her name she ignored me and kept on asking her and she got mad and said ok ok I finish your hair I don’t like what she did I payed her and left I am extremely disappointed.</Review>< Pics>

The "fresh spring roll" really owns up to its name with the crisp and colorful pickled daikon, carrots and cucumber. Given though, the fresh veggies and vermicelli in a perfectly wrapped rice paper roll wasn't even the best part, it was the PEANUT SAUCE that got me.

The tangy slightly sweet peanut sauce with the peanut crunches really set this experience apart.</Text>

Would have been better with fresher bread, tasted like old bread, which is a shame because the actual ingredients in the bahn mi were superb. Rest of the items ordered were great. The spring roll was bomb, egg rolls are good too. I did like that they are friendly and greet you as you come in. The establishment looked very clean, would like to come to this place whenever the craving kicks in again.</review>

Ended up here at random due to the change in hours at another resteraunt. I was extremely appreciative of the open bathroom they had for customers. Ordered a beef bahmi and the beef vermicelli. I enjoyed my food but wish there was a little more meat for the order (vermicello). I found myself still hungry after completing my meal. For the bahmi, I felt bread to be a little stale/hard. Pulling the sandwich apart was difficult. I enjoyed the use of eco friendly packing with paper materials. The interior design is nice and minimalist.  I'm sure it would be a beautiful place to lounge at in the future. I suggest pre-ordering online if you are in a rush. I was here around 1 pm. They were experiencing a late lunch rush but prioritized online orders over customers physically there. Took about 25-30 mins for a to-go walk in order< /Review>

Sheesh. I could see myself going here almost every day. It has that right combo of tasting great while making you feel good too after eating. Right balance of carbs, veggies and meat—all with the amazing flavors of Vietnamese cuisine!! Their chicken and garlic rice is just the perfect mix of flavors and huge portions too. I’d place this up there with Cava as my fav build-your-own bowl type restaurant.<//Text>

NEW FAVORITE SPOT ALERT.. I came with a large group of friends and we decided there's not a bad thing on this menu.  I had the garlic rice w/ beef along with the fresh spring rolls. My love for that garlic rice is indescribable. But holy cow the beef was marinated with perfection. Will be back again soon. Like, VERY soon.< /text>

<Review>This place is amazing! Think incredibly delicious Vietnamese inspired food served in chipotle style service station. You create your own bowl of goodness with super tasty handmade sauces and special items to add like marinated cucumbers, cabbage, and flash fried onions. I can't recommend this place enough!

Fresh, fun flavors.  Easily enough to eating a bowl in two batches for thos who love leftovers, but within an hour I was missing it.  I ate the rest of my first bowl same day then went back last night and took my husband to try it. We was finished before I got halfway.  New favorite place.   Sooooooooooo good. Love to support family owned small businesses. Will be back soon!<//Text>

Wow I would give this place six stars. It is SO good. Absolutely a hidden gem - I wasn’t sure as there aren’t too many reviews but I wanted to give it a shot. The garlic rice with beef is absolutely amazing. You get unlimited toppings (def go for the crispy garlic and crispy onion!!!). The staff is friendly. The place is beautiful indoors and outdoors.<//Text>

<text>I was wishing for just one more yummy spot in my beloved neighborhood, and then BAM! My Lai opened up! I've been twice now and find it to be a reliable spot for fresh and fast-casual Vietnamese food. In addition to using fresh produce and vegan protein options, My Lai also has some very tasty pickled toppings like onions and cabbage. They also have a variety of delicious sauces, so make sure you get a sauce or two.The next time I go back, I am going to make sure I get the spicy pickled onions to amp up the spice on whatever I get.<//text><name>Amanda Daninger Shue</name>< user_id>

Traditional Vietnamese fare with a modern twist. They even have an option for "Impossible meat" that should appeal to those trying to cut out animal protein or want to try something different.

I had a yummy chicken bowl which was pretty good but the star for me was the spring rolls. A large helping of protein (beef,chicken,pork or Impossible meat) with lettuce and pickled vegetables. The sauce for the roll was not as strong as I'm used too but the relatively light flavor complemented the spring roll without overpowering the delightful mix of textures and flavors contained within.

I will be returning here to try their other items in the near future!</review><Name>Troy N< /Name>< user>

The food here is so fresh tasty and flavorful and the egg rolls are the best I've ever tasted! Everything is so good here. My favorite new casual eating spot on the westside. Highly recommend you try this place out.<//Text>

Fresh and delicious Vietnamese food. I went with a pork bowl and it was super tender. I’m usually all about the proteins but I highly recommend the garlic rice.</Review>

Yo this place is maaaad good. Casual vietnamese dining thats clean and healthy, finally! Loved the garlic rice and the chicken. The portions are ENORMOUS! I ate it all and I will definitely take left overs next time lol. Seriously though, prices were very reasonable for the quality and how much you get. 100% will be back to the purple chopsticks!<//text>

A little rowdy, but I was there for the U.F.C fight, so that's probably to blame. Although the T.V. screens within each booth is a cute touch. Everybody appeared to be uptight though.< /text>

🤨...Yes I started with that emoji lol...Ladies and gentlemen as a good man stated two reviews before. There was a man lying outside of Qs bar and he drove by and saw this man throwing up. He stated it, he simply drove by meaning he doesn't know the complete story 😏. This man got out of his car, spoke his peace, and is appreciated. But hey come on by and ask for that full story Monday-Sunday 😁...

Ps.

Ask for that security guard...

...I'm that security guard 😏✌🏿🙏🏿</text>

Checks all the boxes. Very fast service, good selection of drinks, good food, lots of activities (pool tables obviously) and a massive shuffle board table all which are managed effectively, lots of space and even an outdoor balcony. My new favorite drinking place.<//Review>

<Review>Awesome atmosphere. Great full size pool tables that are in good quality. Food is decent...I'd consider it average bar food. Staff was friendly and tvs at all ends of the bar. One large projector in the pool room. They run the projector for big games and events. They have a DJ in the back playing a wide variety of tunes during commercial breaks and after games.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2bb5df4075d1b:0x53f31418f3c61ae4<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Decent bar that has a really big space for school events. Didn't get to play pool but they had a few tables set up in a room. The upstairs area is great for large get togethers. It's also in a nice location next to many other bars</text>

The drinks are what you would expect. My favorite part is the pool tables. That was the highlight of my visit. I love the way it is set up and kind of isolated from the bar. I think they have 8 pool tables.<//Text>< pictures>

What a fun place to go! The staff is very friendly and efficient and the atmosphere is very fun! The food is good, the drinks are cheap and there are lots of pool tables and televisions! Overall fun place to hang out with lots to do and great people! The best night to go is on Ken's semi-world famous trivia night Wednesday!</text>

I love going to this place to watch the Dallas Cowboys play,  but every time I'm there... not one single person asks me if I want anything to eat or drink. The waitresses simply stare at me,  smile sometimes... but again, never ask me if I want anything to eat or drink.  So the service sucks.<//review>

<text>This is a good place to watch a sports game. They seem to manage a large crowd well and stay attentive enough to the service. I'm only giving 3 stars because the food is particularly bad. If they can improve the bar food a bit I think this would be a great place.<//text><username>Michael Moore</username>< Resp>

Love Q's..It's my local. They have a great happy hour..The staff is friendly and the crowd is a mix of locals and UCLA students. Qs.is the kind of place you head to watch sporting events big or small or a quick meet up with friends.< /review>

<text>Q's Billiard Club & Restaurant has quickly become my de facto surrogate Chicago Corner Bar (see Ten Cat). The Jameson and PBR flow just as freely, the staff is just as friendly and the crowd is just as diverse and unpretentious.

And they don't look at me crosseyed when I read at the bar.

<review>I've been here a number of times and it's always a chill place to hangout with friends. I'm not a fan of hanging out at the bar with a ton of muted sports screens as there's many better places to do there, but the pool tables are great, just sometimes not well placed so pick a good one. And look up the rates in advance as they are very different through the week.< /review>< Time>

Billards and bar is great. Free pool before 7. The waitresses are awful though. Better to order at bar than deal with attitudes and delay in service</text>

They have lost my business. I went for New Years this year and was kicked out for not tipping the bartender and my friend was kicked out for spilling a beer. I ordered a beer from upstairs and paid with exact change. The bartender responded sharply with, "Thanks for the tip." I quickly replied with, "I'm sorry I'm a student and your customer." My friend also bought a beer and was not given back his exact change. She stole 4 dollars from him. I work at a restaurant, and from my experience that is not how you treat a customer, no matter how mad or busy you are. The bouncer then came and talked to us about our behavior. We were not causing a problem, but from that moment he was watching us. We stood up from the bar and proceeded to go downstairs to play pool with a buddy. My friend tripped on the last step and spilt his beer. The bouncer immediately kicked us both out. I was kicked out before midnight for not having enough money to tip and for spilling a beer. So Q's has forever lost my business.<//Text>

Shout out to the staff at Q's for losing my credit card last week. Then giving it to the wrong customer this week!

I REALLY APPRECIATE HOW MUCH YOU HAVE INCONVENIENCED ME IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME!!!

I wish it was possible to give you zero stars.

THANKS FOR NOTHING!

<text>What started off as a pleasant experience started to turn bad early. Music was hindering communication during dinner. My friend clearly ordered a chicken salad but was given chicken tenders and fries. After they took it back it was clear they just waited five minutes then cut the chicken up and put it on a salad as the chicken was cold on top of the salad. The waitress did nothing to rectify the situation. After that she told us she was on break and another server would be with us but that server never came and we went unattended with empty beers for 25 minutes and still counting as I write this...<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2bb5df4075d1b:0x53f31418f3c61ae4<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I love Qs! It's a bit of a college pool bar, but the employees are fun and very friendly. It's great for sports because they habe a TON of tv's everywhere. Their bar food is surprisingly fantastic. I say surprisingly because I don't know many pool hall bars that have buffalo chicken salad or grilled steak bites. The food is really good. They are very reasonably priced. This is the kind of place you go to rockin jeans and a t-shirt. It's also great to go to if you want to meet new people. Great memories there. Love it!< /Review>

A loud bar that is packed during game days. They will show UCLA games and other sporting matches as well. There is another floor upstairs with a single huge screen.<//Text>

Ok Q's, back for our 11th year of football Sundays and NOW you have NO substitutions for your lousy 3 choices of omelets?  So cheddar or American "cheese" are the only options - Seriously??  Your menu just deteriorates year after year - do you not care about your clientele?  We love you for your proper array of TV's, but this is an EPIC failure...<//text>

Great place to hang out with friends. Two stories and has nice lounge space. The only downside is that you have to pay to play pool, which I think is lame...< /Review>

Edit: no longer a great sports bar. Went there to watch the Lakers game vs warriors (big game) and they wouldn't pay the sounds...wth

Great sports bar, and decent happy hour with many beers availability. Waitresses are friendly and beautiful (LA hot)

Salads suck here, but the rest of the bar food is decent!

Also plenty of pool tables to reserve, game activity nights, and WiFi.<//Review>

THE Brentwood sports bar. Anytime there is a major sporting event, this place will be busy- especially if a Chicago team is playing.<//review>

Terrible employees. Very rude and the customers are loud and annoying.  Customers tend to get very loud and disturb the entire neighborhood. The employees do not care about the residential neighborhood.ASSWHOLES<//Review>

Very noisy bar with pool tables.  Two floors with small balcony on the second level.  There are also couches, a TV, and a foosball (table football, as in soccer)  on the second floor, which beats staying on the first level.  Parking can be difficult so arrive with a cab if possible.<//text>
