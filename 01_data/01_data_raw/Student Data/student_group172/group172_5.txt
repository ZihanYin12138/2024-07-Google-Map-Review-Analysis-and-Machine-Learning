<rate>5<//rate><review>Fun venue.  Saw King Diamond here in December (2019).  There isn't a bad seat in the whole venue.  Decent drink selection (at usual concert venue prices).
The lighting and sound were much better than expected.  When other bands I want to see come here, I will be sure to go again.
1 BIG plus.  Parking is FREE and there is plenty of it...< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNn5tkzuhftaCu4Km1lWMXNesqYfO9pFvDjhr-a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkDhJc3ssjl7KwGnfipQF5DS_XQG3OeJpPwTTs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcrEPqP1AQiKuRnBtI3rfiB0o6khVTX0DHr7Ak=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5L1matk5l-96NL184u3kwnB4izh5CrlMDpKn7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzEX8DlZzGPl_bLtHoiBwLqzZDW1YE0dO7uSS9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUMH1hGD9o6NYSYH86o59GV4rcIHZqJaI8qwhP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHX-8moObNEvJ_3pnnOyGR8qPxtsMZl1do62IF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOp1joVn4LK0OtE93c4EixKVdos0YxvDcRjK1MW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqTF6x0fRic9N8QoAIuD9-LEF9xI_GEm_BZ4I1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

This venue just opened, the few bad comments below are completely off. There are snack carts everywhere. Security to get it was very easy as they had multiple metal detectors and people checking. Alcoholic drinks are what all Live Nation venues charge. Bottled water was only $3 not $4.
And so far the first band that finished up was amazing. Sound in here is fantastic.
I think this is an amazing place to have big name bands play.<//Text>

We went for the Dave Koz Holiday concert.  Excellent venue.  Free parking.  Easy to get to. Every seat is great. Only one women's bathroom on the main floor. Long line for the women's restroom at the intermission. Concert was excellent.<//Text>

Very nice theater. First time I've been there and was impressed. I was in row K and felt pretty close to the stage. Nice layout and look. I'll be looking into other acts they have there in the future<//Text>

<text>We went to Patti LaBelle Concert, which was sold out.  We had excellent seats 3rd row center.  Love the renovations and glad we have a local venue once again for El Cajon.  The staff were smiling, informative and helpful.  The bartenders were also smiling, engaging and did not 'short pour'.  Concert seats are padded and comfortable. Stage acoustics and lighting is good as well.

Ms. Patti was amazing as well as her band and backup singers.   We had an excellent time.<//text><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Best venue in San Diego! Easy, free and accessible parking for the events.Exceptional line up of talent.And the bar is unexpectedly great with more than just beer or wine to choose from. The entire downtown around it has great restaurants and art galleries to visit before performance s.-Best new discovery!< /Text>

<review>Nice venue with plenty of parking. Magnolia is walking distance to several restaurants if you want a pre-show dinner, and there is a large, full bar inside the theater. There are no bad views, any seat will do, but they are a little tight on leg room. The sound system was great. You can skip the VIP lounge, it's oversold, tiny, and probably not what you imagine.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwvn0mhBqUV6waVb7HujjfIPnJjVTr8hUXtb3u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< date>

<text>I'm not sure what can I say about the venue because I have more to say about the show itself. Anyway, it uses the same parking as the court house parking. The place itself is pretty new and well maintained. It has concession stands which serves alcohol. At the event yesterday, it sold popcorn, cotton candy, and cotton candy. Cool little place.< /text><name>Samantha Bielman< /name>< Gmap_id>

<text>The theater was very comfortable. Good sound, and aisles big enough that we didn’t feel crowded, like in many other concert venues. Free parking, reasonable ticket prices, and most shows don’t seem to sell out, so it’s a pretty relaxed setting. Will definitely go back for more shows!<//text><pics>None< /pics><user_name>Meredith Perry<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

Very comfortable venue. Would like to see more and more classic rock and blues and jazz acts here. Small enough that you will find your friends, big enough that you feel like you are at a concert.. Tickets are priced much better than other small/medium San Diego venues.< /Review>

Great to have a new alternative outside downtown and the usual San Diego venues. Can't give that the place was originally built in a different millennium, but provides a fairly comfortable seated concert hall with good acoustics and a "small-ish" kind of feel.
Big downside: only two bathrooms for the entire venue means long lines during intermission.
Also, rather limited options for concessions.</text>

<text>I got tickets for the February 22 show of Sinbad. If you go to The Magnolia website and check out their tickets for events and then go to the box office and get them there you will save a Ton of money. I saved over $20 per ticket and got 2 great seats. If you use other ticket sale websites you pay double the cost per seat plus fees. Best way is go to the box office and they will show you what's available and the price. Worth the trip.</text>< rating>

First time at this venue. Our Art Garfunkel Ticketmaster /Live Nation receipt and our concert ticket said 7 pm start time—so we left North county at 5:15 pm to get here before 7 pm. Got to the venue and was advised that the concert start time is 8 pm. What the heck? We go to a LOT of concerts and never had this situation. Get your act together.</Text>

<Text>Loved the small venue for sure. But thought the sound was better in the restroom than the concert hall. Will try again if another artist appears that I am interested in. Drive from Oceanside for Pat Benetar, she did not disappoint along with her husband  Neil Gerardo.
Also suggest a video screen.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

I enjoyed the seating areas. You have a great view no matter where you were seated.  There was even walk room for people to pass by without you having to stand up. Only suggestion I would make is make the letters bigger for the rows or paint the letters on the floor in front of each row. Some of us have a vision issue when the lights are low. Because the usher's are at always helpful.</Review>

Drinks were really expensive, and I think the venue takes a cut of all the bands' merch sales, thus making tee shirts cost more. My friend had a real problem with a particular security guard. My friend was at the front, in front of the barrier, and this security guard kept standing directly in front of him, blocking his view. Even when he moved, the guard got in his way. Not sure if the guard worked directly for Live Nation, or an agency. This was at the King Diamond show. That's really what kept this review from being 5-stars.</Review>< pictures>

Great venue. Tonight's concert with Pat Benatar sounded better in woman's bathroom than in audience.
Band was way too loud over her, that was a bummer. Bartenders said a lot of people had said the same.
Still a great venue.</text>

<text>Nice place, great acoustics, very friendly and professional staff. My only issue was when buying tickets, I was shown the seats I was getting as being very near the middle of the auditorium, right to left, but I got the 3rd and 4th seats from the side. Good thing pretty much all seats are good.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>Great new venue for concerts and comedy. The sound has been hit and miss Alan Parsons was great Prince keyboards were not audible for half the show. Pat Benitars husbands guitar had only highs no mids where most of the guitar sound should be. Are you using a local mix engineer or do the band bring their own?<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Sound system and/or acoustics in this venue were terrible for the Fan Halen/LedZepAgain gig. So bad we left after about 5 songs of the LZ set. Seen them before and the bands are great, so it's the venue not the bands. Interestingly the sound was decent in the lobby as we left, so not sure what's going on with the place. Won't be returning< /review>

Magnolia, formerly Eact County Performing Arts Center (ECPAC), has been completely renovated and will begin hosting shows mid-September 2019. The theater looks fantastic. Live Nation will manage the venue and has 50+ shows scheduled for the first 12 months of operations . Definitely a must see place for a show. Check it out.<//text>

First impression isnt good security way to much treats you like a criminal, not even unopened bottle of water allowed I have dry mouth so need to sip water instead I was forced to pay $4 for a water, absolutely no snacks there is nothing about safety it's all about money, after dealing with security the venue is very nice seats are comfortable , to bad has to start with a negative experience  go to alot of events and security was the worst by far<//Text>

Wonderful,  fun and tasty day selling at the rummage sale! Lots of vendors with  lots of treasures priced to sale! Boyscouts were selling crepes, nachos, teriyaki chicken, etc. Really good!!!</Text>

Attended the Walnut Christmas dinner dance. The staff was fun, friendly, and entertaining with their skits. The band, Chico, played a lot of danceable music, and we got fed to boot. It was a nice way to spend a dancing evening.<//review>

< Review>
I went to vote.  Much money spent on senior center.  It's a shame we were cramped into a small room to do our civic duty and privilege.  That was quit a  eye opener for city funds to be used for the convenience of a few and not all citizens when we need it.<//Review>

<Review>A group of friends attended Walnuts annual Mother's Day Lunch. It was well planned and catered event, from the decorations to the games and prizes. I would recommend it. Also loved the food and not having to cook and clean up. Very satisfying. M.A. Phillips<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Food was really good for a fast food Chinese chain.
Clean atmosphere.
Parking available.
The only negative point which I will mention, as a mom, the high chairs aren't high enough for the tables for a child to eat comfortably. I fed her, instead of her being able to grab her own food which is fine...</Text><gmapID>0x80dd25c903023c95:0xea76bbd8ddb2388a< /gmapID><pictures>None<//pictures>< Date>

How sad these employees have to sit and suffer. There's gotta be something they could do to make the restaurant more comfortable.

I can't imagine what it's like working behind the counter right next to the flames.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Food has been typically good. This review is for being hung up on. I called to ask if they were delivering tonight, the female employee said delivery was no longer available but offered a 10% off coupon to pick up. I replied that I am sick, so that wasn't going to happen, & she promptly hung up on me. I've been battling the flu for 5 days. Not only am I incapable of driving myself there necessitating delivery, but have no desire to put others health at risk. That being said, being hung up on is not the way to keep customers or to encourage them to return or to encourage others to go.</text>< Pics>

Bad service.  Seems like if they get more then 2 orders and can't keep up. Need better people on taking orders and making sure things are processed first come and first served with online and delivery orders. If you cant handle doing phone and online orders log yourself out.<//Text>

I went to this location for the first time last night and I really liked that the staff accommodated to this cold customer by turning on the heater.It was just great customer service and it was nice to see that the staff really wanted to have their customers enjoy dinner without freezing. Thank you for your great smiles and customer service!< /text>

While we don\'t serve "Rustler Ribeye Steak", if we did, we guarantee we would eat the whole dang thing also, just as you had described. If you are a fan of surprise flavors, our Thai Coconut Curry is bursting with flavor and our House Special Chicken, caramelized in a blend of soy, white wine, and garlic will take your taste buds on a joy ride they will never want to come back from! It\'s entirely possible you reviewed the wrong restaurant, but we would like to invite you in for an amazing meal the next time you are in our area anyway, so we can try and earn your five star review!'}< /resp>

Lane did great! I got exactly what I wanted, would have given them a 5 but I don't think they have AC. Plus they need better chairs. But service is great! Provide water and even add rose petals when soaking your feet. They are also very detailed and careful when doing their job. Found my nail place ♡</review>

< review>
My first visit Fri, 3/1519 and was taken 25mins past my apt time; I should have known then they don’t care about there service. But I still waited because of all the rave my coworkers gave this place. As soon as the male technician DID NOT check if any of my nails were lifting and just applied powder, I knew!! ....2 days later, 2 nails lifted. Went back 3days later to get a refund and she said No! She said why would she refund my $38 for 2 nails. I explained bcuz more will left in a few days and I’ll have to replace the set. She went on and on, I cut her short and told her I been doing acrylic for 20years and wouldn’t have them replace any of my nails for the simple fact that they don’t care how they do them, they cut corners and don’t care water or moisture can get under the nail and created fungus or infections. So I reported them to the BBB, no business should disregard the quality of service they give to customers that pay good money. Simple fact! They improperly perform service to customers and get away with it. Well, not with me! BBB was notified and I’ll make sure they are thoroughly checked.</review>

This place is great! I have been in California now for 4 months,  and tried several nail salons. This is the first one that I was truly happy with.  It was a very nice place, friendly people,  and I can now say I have found a nail salon I will go back to. I love my nails and Julie did a great job!   I will be a regular customer going forward :-)< /Text>

It was my very first time getting acrylic and gel nails. For my first experience I was willing to be accepting of how my nails would turn out to look. One thing I did want, was for the nail color in both my toe and hand nails to match. First, they were trying to convince not  get an acrylic on my toes ( i needed it though as I had foolishly cut them in a weird angle) The manicure was looking great until the color started setting. The gel color did not match my toes. I pointed this out to the manicurist. They insisted it was the same ( my nails on my hand were clearly a bright scarlet red, while my toes nails were of a burgundy/brown color). I pleaded with them to find  the matching color , they're answer, over and over again ( as they kept applying coat after coat) was that the polish read the same name as that of the one they had used on my nails. Apparently when using a gel color that has the same name as a regular nail polish, will be lighter and not the same as they kept saying ( I now know). They finally found one similar to match the color on my toes. I thought they would have wiped off  the red color off, but instead they just put another coat of "the right color" on top. I Got left with what looks like chunky nails. I did not like feeling as if I could not get what I wanted or was paying for. The prices for both a mani and  pedi are more expensive then what I am accustomed to compared to different nail salons I've been to. So, the reason for my three stars? It is a unique - small nail salon.The place was clean with beautiful and simple decoration. Perhaps if I would have kept the first nail color that was applied to my nails, I would have been ok with it, but again I wanted to get what I was paying for . I barely noticed how chunky the nail color looks on top of my acrylics when I got home.  I am willing to give my nails another chance with acrylics. Not sure if it will be this place again though. Would have really wanted them to wipe away that first color to show more professionalism  from a manicurist.</Text>

Place is aesthetically pleasing. Beautiful pedicure chairs, and clean interior; hence giving it 2 stars. I called ahead of time and was given a 'fill' price. Once the gentleman started his work he stated it would be $10 more due to the length of my nails and a repair on one. Ok, I'm already there... agree to new price. He didn't say much, other than telling me to go wash my hands and put my hands under UV dryer. If I may, I'll attach pictures to support my disappointment in quality of work. The tips are uneven, my natural nails underneath acrylic were not filed evenly alongside acrylic edges, he didn't turn my hands over and clean/sand down underneath my acrylic nail where fingertips collect gunk(my normal lady does), the worst part is that the acrylic/gel on my nail bed is so uneven. Some parts of acrylic is thick, bumpy, and I have air bubbles throughout my gel color. I can fix/file some things myself to make it look better but the latter items, I can't. I came here based on reviews I read. I will not be returning and next time my nail lady is on vacation (different salon), I'll wait for her to return. Maybe others have had better service and quality work. I only got my gel-fill, no pedicure... so can't comment on that service. Also, just small details I noticed: no lotion was  put on my hands, nor oil around the cuticles upon completion. Hope my review helps you.< /text>

<Review>I love the service here but they don’t honor appointments you make.  I called and had a 2pm appt for 3 pedicures (me mom and kiddi for the first time) I came at 2pm and all the seats were taken and a pair of people were just starting - knowing we had appointments. They sat me at the far end and my mom and kiddo eventually at the other end.  They didn’t get started on us until 20 mins later.  I don’t know why I even bothered setting appointments when they won’t honor them to walk ins<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><date>1525641396150</date>< user>

Went there for the first time today and asked for a  peddy for both me and a friend...they had the nerve to tell me that they didnt have time for us....what kind of  service is that? Horrible experience specially since I took my friend with me after reading the reviews. Made me feel like a dumbass. Never again will I go there. :/</text>

Good nail designers but pricey oppose to your regular nail salon very polite will offer you bottle water but at that price its expected..Nice if your out to pamper yourself but if you in a rush or on a  budget Id keep looking<//Review>

First time here and i loved it! I'm a simple girl that loves rice and veggies with anything and this is the spot! I got the waba veggie bowl with steak and chicken and a side of dumplings and it was delicious! Definitely would come back!</Review>

There were a lot of staff and very loud. Yet, service was way too slow. They seemed to be confused with their orders.</text>

I placed my order online like they asked. I guess that gives them the liberty to give me a bowl with no broccoli or onions like I specified. When I went back to get my money back they told me the manager would call me back to issue me the refund. I just got off the phone with the manager. I explained again that my bowl had no broccoli literally. She said give me 15 minutes to look into this. Seriously what do you need to look into. I'm a dissatisfied customer and I'm asking for a refund. I took your bowl back. It's been nearly 3 days. Then hangs up on me when I ask if she has my number. Someone hates their job. SMH<//text>

At the Chula Vista location the employees seem very unhappy and unfriendly and that's too bad because it's the closest one to me. I visited a location in San Bernadino/ Riverside on my way back from Big Bear and there was a huge difference in customer service. The other location didn't keep their sauces in the back counter out of customer's reach. They were also very welcoming and personable. CV location is ghetto. The girl seemed annoyed that I asked her to pour me a container of serrano sauce when she only gave me the sauces that came in packets. Oh well, maybe management should go back to keeping the sauces on the counter for customers.< /Review>

Service was good but they put way too much rice and very little steak or chicken. Charge too much for pretty much rice with a hint of meat. Also they didn't put the green onions on top of my meat. They did last time. Wasn't busy inside so they had time.</Review>

Though the brown rice was a bit disappointing everything else I ordered was delicious and on point, best miso soup I have had thus far, and I advise getting the Wabba Rice Veggie Bowl, great value for what you order< /Review>

Poorly managed! The food is decent (even though the miso soup is made from hot water and single serving packets) but the service staff is awful. They would not promptly acknowledge customers standing at the counter and did not supply forks at the condiment section (but had double spoons).</Text>

I came in at 8:28 exact. And they said they were out of white rice, which is my favorite rice. And not only that. The female cashier up front also said they did not have any veggies and that they were closing early. So then I asked politely that if they didn’t mind making me a bit veggies because after the gym I wanted a healthy meal. They said said no making me a face that made me feel so uncomfortable. I will never come back here again. I will be taking my money back to chipotle we’re the employees make me feel like home and wouldn’t mind making me a little meal.</Review>

The concept of waba grill at this location is good. But the employees other then the managed move really slow and some have difficulty with english. The food is always gonna be the same. Just work on the cistomer service and maybe some knife training from what i can see over the counter. And train them on the menu you guys have also. Ive had a moment where i asked for a veggie bowl and the employee was so confused on to why i didnt want meat with my bowl??<//Review>

It was okay - it's a good healthy option (I got a rice, veggie, and salmon bowl), but there's nothing special about it.< /Review>

Fast but too expensive. I was ten minutes away from home, and it was over $120. Definitely recommend if its your only option. Great service though!!< /Text>

No radio, no lights, no nothing. I thought it could be battery related so, I contacted my roadside assistance company that in terms contracted A and J Towing.
The Tow Gentleman: Douglas promptly arrived, greeted me and asked questions about what I think the cause of it not starting could be. After assessing, he determined that the cable from the battery of one of the post was off. Quick fix.

Douglas was very professional and even the dispatcher ( I didn't get her name) was extremely professional as well. Overall, experience A plus. If I ever have any future situations...will see if their services can be utilized.

Friendly, professional and a can do attitude.  Was not an easy tow job, as I was in a parking garage, next to a pillar, and the steering wheel was locked.  Just a pleasant surprise to have him show up, make it look easy, and smile as he drove away to drop the car off.  Hopefully, I won't need em again, but if I do, I am calling A&J Towing!< /review>

<Text>Needed a tow a 3;30 am and dispatcher was rude because I asked if I could ride in the cabin. I understand with COVID that is not acceptable at this time but I asked when I can expect the tow truck since it’s been over 1 hour keep in mind it’s 330 am!

I told him not to start with me that was me getting my service cancelled at 330 am !

Paid for my service as well and had to wait another hour due to this person having a short fuse ...

I think leaving someone stranded at 330 am is correct and I wanted to voice my opinion and unhappiness with this tow service !</Text>< Time>

My car broke down in the middle of the 405 freeway after leaving Nissan of Torrance. I got towed out of the freeway, and the local driver that worked for the state was a great guy. The ETA was a hour, no problem. I was at the intersection of 190th and Harborgate way. The driver Jose Velazco called and had a bad attitude from the start. I informed him I wasn’t familiar with the area as I just moved here from the east coast. He said “You know what? Call canceled” then hung up on me. So I was on the side of the road till 2000 hrs waiting on a different tow truck company. Called twice to speak to a manager about this guys terrible customer service skills, and never got a call back. Zero out of ten, these people aren’t worth a f*ck.< /review>

The tow driver was good but the woman that I talked to on the phone (that refused to give her name) was extremely rude and disrespectful. When. I asked to speak with a manager or supervisor she told me she was it and I couldn't talk to anyone else. I had set up a future time and day. When the truck didn't arrive on time I called to check. She answered and as I tried to explain what's going on she interrupted me and told me it's going to be at least another 30 minutes and if I didn't want to wait she will cancel it and go find another. Then she hung up in the middle of my conversation. I called back and she admittedly hung up the phone and said do I want the tow or not. Because of my time constraints I had to keep it but never again.<//Review>

Picture this, I'm running late to work, low on gas and while pumping gas I lock my keys inside my car on accident! Instant freak out mode. so many thoughts flying through my head, perhaps the most important, "how am I getting to work" I called the local locksmith to no avail, they were rude and couldnt even give me an estimate on when they would arrive. I didnt want to give up and tried to buy a few things from the gas station to break into my own car... I had lost hope and decided to wait for my wife to come get me with the spare key, and was in the process of deciding how to spend my next 8 hours at the gas station since she was at work. When all of sudden, an A&J towing company vehicle pulls up to pump gas next me and asks if I needed assistance. No faster after I said yes, the driver got down and had my door open in less than 5 minutes. Better yet, he was courteous and understanding of my situation. They will forever have my business!!!!<//text>

Worst customer service company I have dealt with. Placed an order in the morning and they tried to change their story before the towing service last minute. Talked to Riña and later her supervisor, Tony, to share the experience and during the conversation, he would hang up on you. I wasted total of 12 hours with these people with their crapped service.</text>

My car was in an accident and was towed to this place. I asked from driver when can I come and get my belongings from the car. I explicitly asked if they are open during weekend, his answer was yeessss!!!! Anytime between 9 to 5.

So I asked a friend to give me ride on Sunday. When I got there, their gate was open also their customer service window was open but they asked me to pay $$90! To get my stuff from car, because it's after hours.

I told them that your driver told me it's okay to come during weekend. You are open. But the guy was rude, aggressive and basically kept my stuff hostage to get $90. I am letting my insurance know that they denied my access to my own car, so probably they can charge one more night.<//Text>

<Text>Absolutely the best Towing company hands down!!! They got to me in a timely manner. Customer Service was excellent! Kemic Santa Cruz went over and beyond my expectations considering the dangerous position I was in. He was quick, efficient and courteous!! I couldn't have asked for anything more!
Great Job Guys!!!

<Review>Had the worst experience with them someone called to have my vehicle towed out of my parking area, driver backed in to tow my vehicle as I had just loaded my grandson into the carseat & turned around to go in front door to grab his baby bag, I came out driver was ready to Hitch up my car and tow away my grandson in car...! I stopped him and asked him did he realize what he was doing and he said all he knew was that he had a call to tow a car from the parking area, I asked did he know there was a child in the in the back in a child's car seat he said that he did not and he apologized. After speaking with him he became polite and we had a conversation but then a very round, Charlie Brown looking fellow approached that was a tow truck driver also from the same company very rude and speaking in an Arabic language then he became irate with me telling me they did not have to tell me anything or apologize for anything and to tow the car with the kid if they had to... i then approached him and said that he was being rude and he needed to calm down and think about what he was saying, thereafter he walked away and the slim driver that I had been speaking with in the beginning apologize again explain his position I understood we shook hands and that was that, but Charlie Brown stayed behind in his tow truck staring at my car as though he was going to seek revenge...

I wish there were something lower than one star. This place is organize crime at its best.  They illegally towed my sons car, would not release it after we provided all of the documentation they required. Once they decided to release it and we paid in full my son was given permission to get his car from the lot and drive it out of the gate.  As he stopped at the gate with my wife to make a final inspection before leaving a tow truck driver who  said he owned the company blocked the gate with his tow truck assaulted my son and forced him out of the gate leaving my wife locked inside the tow yard and would not let her leave. He became very aggressive yelling  and encroaching on her personal space leaving her feeling very threatened. He was intimidating her so badly she called 911 and pleaded for help.  The legal term for what he was doing was clearly wrongful imprisonment and  caused serious emotional distress which can be heard on the 911 call where my wife is crying and pleading for help.  After a race to get the keys from the  ignition of the car, before the owner of the tow company, she was able to lock herself in the car. While cussing and yelling with rage he still refused to let her leave the property and the gate remain closed for quite some time. After about 10 or 15 minutes of my son's grandmother pleading with the owner to let her daughter go free  he agreed and move the tow truck then opened the gate all the while yelling profanities and threatening my son and wife.  They also stole from the car and made false criminal accusations against my son which were later determined to be unfounded by the police.  Their fees are outrageous an unjust.  Unfortunately there is little that can be done through law enforcement when tow companies abuse their power. So angry and frustrated.< /review>

<review>Avoid using this towing company at all costs so you don't have to go through what I'm going through currently to repair the damage they caused from towing my car.  I called Hyundai roadside assistance yesterday and they sent out A&J Towing.  They towed my car to South Bay Hyundai dealership and they found marks on the suspension caused by the towing which knocked it out of alignment.  I called A&J Towing and they said a manager will call me to discuss.  Someone by the name of Andy phoned and was very rude.  I tried to tell him what the dealership told me but he spoke over me and wouldn't let me speak.  Next thing I knew the call was disconnected so I called him back and he said the call wasn't disconnected he hung up on me.  I was beside myself, again I tried to tell him what the dealership told me and he wouldn't let me speak then hung up on me again.  I have filed a complaint with BBB and Hyundai Roadside assistance and they will be conducting an investigation.</review><time>1520361877484<//time>< Pics>

<text>Worst tow experience of my life. Driver got lost in Torrance, CA which in itself seems almost impossible, showed up 30 minutes late after calling me to verify location and get directions. After picking myself and the vehicle up requested I sign a waiver that they would not be liable for any damage they cause to my vehicle in performing their services - tow to their facility / store it overnight / tow to dealer. I refused to sign as obviously if the driver had an accident and damaged or even totalled my vehicle they would be liable. So he turned around and dropped me back where he picked me up, except on the wrong side of the street in a no parking done even after I told him I wanted to be dropped off where he picked me up.</text>< time>

They make money by Stealing our cars, I get it, I got caught/towed, I can own That.

The establishment is Classless - The Cashier Got it my face, hurled labels on how I am "Privileged" how "They got me" and spit at me, luckily for her, the surveillance camera was facing her back, so the Sheriff could not clearly see the incident<//Text>

I had always gone by the wine room but never went in. My friends and I decided to try it tonight before dinner, and it was wonderful! The service was excellent and our host was very kind. We were going to have to wait for a table, but he moved a few things around to allow us to sit immediately. Their tapas plate was delicious (a bit expensive but you get that everywhere in PA), and their wine selection was, no surprise, very extensive! Loved it and will definitely be coming back.<//Text>

Serene downtown Palo Alto stop for eclectic mix of Africa to Monterey County wines with a few knockouts from Napa and Sonoma. Get a panini and you are set. Pro knowledgeable staff add to the allure. Back room fab for a small gathering.</Review>

Real housemade ingredients going into Paninis, Cheese & Charcuterie platters are full and available To-Go, and you can also take a glass to-go or buy a bottle from their Wine Shoppe. 👌🍷🥂< /Text>

Palo Alto secret. Cozy and romantic coves around two real fireplaces to sip the best in wines and food platters. Neat place to chat intimately. Two separate rooms. Quiet one in the back, ruckus in front. Excellent.<//Text>

Great spot, cosy, welcoming. My opinion is that it would be very cramped for big(ger) groups. The biggest group I noticed when I was there was a group of 5. Good selection of wine and appetizers. I'd definitely go back more often, sit by the window seats, and enjoy the wine and ambience.<//text>

Like sipping wine in the most cozy Mission-style living room you can imagine but in the most lively center of Palo Alto.

Very few establishments still maintain the level of service found here: they are patient, very knowledgeable (some make their own wine), and remember you more often than you expect.

They also have one of the best wine bar tag lines ever on their t-shirts.</text>

Such a great place for meeting friends (small party though)or your significant others.
Very cozy and authentic environment and great wine! But the space is widely open and small.
A little bit pricey, but it’s a great place for a date night.
There are some street parking spots, the city parking is like two blocks away, three hours of free parking.< /Review>

Decent selection of rotating wines here. I really like the casual comfortable atmosphere in here. It is a good place to relax with a couple friends after work. Doesn't handle big groups well though. I have done a couple of their appetizers and they all have been good.</Review>

A wine bar that's exactly what it says it is -- A good place to chill out and drink wine without feeling like you're somewhere too bougie. The staff is really friendly as well. My default when I come to Palo Alto. I wish that their menu was a little bit bigger for food, but the cheese plate is great so I'll almost always be happy with that.<//text>

<text>Cool spot, cozy, but great place to catchup with friends.

I enjoy the rotating flight that they offer.

I will say that it is a bit pricier than other wine bars that I've visited. (Looking at $12 minimum for a glass)

Despite the price, they have a wonderful selection.

They do offer memberships, which make it super worth it to subscribe to :)< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><Time>1437763451957</Time>< user>

Went on a date & lost track of time last night when I was here! 3 hours and only 3 glasses of wine! Feel bad I occupied the seats for so long, as this place is super crowded :P Good people - did not ask us to leave! :D  Did not find a place to sit down for sometime, but it was worth the wait. Good selection of wines. Did not eat, but I assume they have good food too. Would highly recommend this place, but..would ask people to leave earlier! ;)<//review>< Pics>

Competitively crowded. We sharked a table and enjoyed the wine. A bit overpriced, and the service was a bit lacking.. We had to seek out our waiter a few times after too much time went by not seeing him. Hummus was.. nothing special.. Cheeses were very exotic and good. Atmosphere very fun and cozy.< /Review>

<text>It's ok. The food is a bit expensive and the service was not too friendly or efficient but the wine was good and the food was pretty good too. It's a good spot to sit for a chat, I'll probably come again.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

We like the wine room. Problem is they're usually very crowded and hard to find seatings specially that they don't seem to take names and you just have to stand around the place waiting for people to leave to take their seats.

Nevertheless it's a pretty nice atmosphere and seatings. The wine and snacks are also pretty good. Get the Almonds plate.<//Review>

<Text>Allthough the atmosphere is pretty OK and the service wasn't bad (it was pretty OK) the wine wasn't that good. And on a second look the room was all about fake presentatoin of self. Don't really like this fake atmosphere. Could be a one off, cause I just visited once.</Text>< Pics>

<user_id>111975404822308274576<//user_id><Text>I hadn't been to The Wine Room in a long time and recently returned on an evening out with my BFF.  Everything was exactly as I remembered: soft dimmed candle lights and comfy sofas; intimate and cozy and absolutely inviting.  I am in love with the ambiance here.

Last time I was here they didn't have an official wine list but now they do.  However, sit at the bar and talk to the wine sommelier.  They will give you great suggestions and even offer ideas that are not on the menu.

On this particular evening, John was helping us and he was a pleasure.  His customer service was top notch.  He helped me chose my wines and allowed me to try various ones until I found something that I liked.  After discussing our preferences with him, he gave us a taste of something off the menu.  We had such a great time that at the end of the evening, BFF and I couldn't even keep track of how many glasses we've had.

The Wine Room is a gem in Palo Alto.</Text>< pics>

a hipster joint for sure! if you are into the wine and cheese scene, you will probably like it.. the place is a little cramped, but pretty much exactly what you can expect from a hipster wine bar in Palo Alto.</text>

(Translated by Google) It is a restaurant with a unique atmosphere where you can relax and enjoy wine on the sofa. Some sweet wines I like, 5 stars.

<user_name>Clara Jornet< /user_name><response>None<//response><Text>(Translated by Google) It is a very elegant wine cellar with an atmosphere, grown-up people. Dinner is expensive, but having a glass of wine and some cheeses has its charm.

<rating>5< /rating><review>Ol Rodeo's store is the best! The meat department is always fresh. The produce is always on point. The hot food department is cooked fresh everyday and with love " and yes you can taste the love she puts in everything she cooks". The prices are great. The staff is always friendly and ready to help even with special request they're always helpful. I go there any and every time I get the chance. I love it.<//review>< pics>

<Text>Love this butcher shop. I always buy my meat here when I'm having a carne asada. Both the chicken and beef marinades are very aromatic and really spark with mexican flavor. The quality of meat is always top notch, never chewy. They also have a ton of other goods like lonjanisa,salsa,and tortillas.

<review>Awesome Carne Asada

Was next door for some yogurt and realized I forgot my coupon.  Heard that sometimes the market had coupon books too, so I figured I’d see if they had one (and they did).  When I walked inside, they welcomed me in and the smell was AMAZING.  I got a few pounds of carne asada, and I’m glad I did!

The carne was awesome, paper thin and super flavorful.  I’ll definitely be back for more!<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80d9584d639cf1bf:0x28dc82049d4efcf< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I drove by this place a few times before and decided to go in and see what they have. Glad I did because the marinated beef steak is so good! It is very flavorful and I have been going to get it once a week now. Their flour tortillas are good too along with their guacamole they sell. The salsas are only okay. If you go to this store, get the marinated beef steak, its a must!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>I love this market and visit them weekly. They carry big beef bones for my big dogs and will cut them up in sizes 5h as t I want. A entire bone is about 10 large bones cut up. For $10 a bag its exceptional.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80d9584d639cf1bf:0x28dc82049d4efcf<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Best value for catering. Feeds 20+ people, beef, chicken, beans, rice, limes, onion & cilantro, salsa, guacamole, tortillas, chips and cotija for around $145! We've used them twice for parties and the food is wonderful and the staff is really nice. Will use them for years to come!< /text>

A small local favorite hidden in East County best known for their warm hospitality and marinated carne asada. Great home style eats, the birria is made fresh daily (best in San Diego) and a beautiful butcher counter with a variety of your favorite cuts. Stop by for your next cook out or drop in for some great tasting street tacos. 😋😊< /Review>

Great place to shop for some good fresh Palomilla & Arrachera meat. Great selection of warm tortillas and all the goods to go with a nice Carnita Asada. Customer service is great as well. Always a good idea to call in your order ahead of time if you have a big order meat to prepare.< /Review>

Any hardware you need you can find it here. I gave it 4 stars because I duplicated a key and it didn't work.. I got a new one with no extra fees but still, it should have worked the first time.<//review>

Central location, well-functioning store. My favorite product they carry is Weatherwash wood stain that ages wood to give the grey barnwood look. Would recommend.</Review>

Don't know what it is but ever since Orchard was bought out our household must return to this store too often. This is simple math, if someone asks for 20 feet you cut 20 foot. This is not rocket science and sad that once such a great place has become rubbish. Orchard train your employees how to measure!

Not to mention it took 20 minutes to get this cut this morning....<//Text>< pictures>

First time at this store (as I moved from out of state). They have a great selection, etc... BUT their customer service is amazing. From the woman in the front asking if you need assistance... totally walked me to the exact item I wanted (could have said isle 4 left side) to the person that checked me out having a real convo with me.  Great job. I will be back</Text>

This is their flagship store for the region and is new after being opened a year or so ago. It's definitely aimed towards the home DIY and maintenance cried and not the building Trade.

It's got an amazing array of products, all of reasonable quality (but not convinced sometimes by the garden furniture section). Power tools, garden tools, paints, screws, bolts, storage, keys, plants, bathroom.... I almost always end up spending more money then I mean to :(

On holidays they have fun kids activities or the front or in the garden centre.

The loyalty scheme doesn't provide any significant discounts so don't rush to give them your personal info.</text>

<text>Didn't have exactly the kind of shovel I was looking for, but I found an acceptable one. The awkward part was getting it sharpened (ALWAYS GET YOUR TOOLS SHARPENED BEFORE FIRST USE--go for knife-edge sharpness!). First dude, an older guy, said he'd never done one before, and then I pointed out that it was listed on their handout on their counter that they do it! So someone else had to come in and do it. Knife Stalkers are better but a bit more expensive. Sharpen even your hand trowels, edgers, everything. Makes all the difference in the world.< /text>< pics>

This is next to the original OSH location and does a good job of giving a warm and nostalgic feeling for what it used to be like, except in an updated way. There are some good pictures near the restrooms which show how life was when this area was known as the Valley of the Heart's Delight.<//Review>

<review>The new store looks really good. I find OSH stores size easier to navigate and I usually find everything I'm looking for.   The floor workers are always very helpful.  I wished they had upgraded their point of sale terminals.  They are so slow.  Also, I find the cashiers not to be very friendly.  I'm not looking for best friends here, but simply courteous and effective cashiers.</review>< gmap_id>

Makes a difference when you can get help right away by just asking any one of several store floor agents;  without paging several times for help and waiting for ever only to find out - nope don't have it.  Amazing experience.<//review>

Fabulous store, goods, and folks. But if you're going to block all but one tiny driveway to the San Jose store during construction and then go block that with a garden dirt delivery truck, why not just close?! VERY frustrating to not be able to get there.</text>

<review>I like the 'new' store organization.  But personnel on floor are under trained, which is annoying to your customers and sure costly to the corporation.  I came in, Dec 5, 2016 around 11 am to buy a small item I needed.  I had to search for floor clerk.  None.  I found my item, but needed someone to cut it (tubing).  I saw a young woman, doing little and said, "I need someone to cut..".  She said, "oh, sorry wait, I have a phone call." I watched as she casually chatted, and was visiting another clerk when she saw me lurking."Oh. sorry. forgot.."  She then took 10 more minutes figuring how to cut the plastic tubes. "Do you want these taped together?" she asked.  I didn't care but it seemed to take another 6 or seven to put some blue tape on the items while she joked with another OSH clerk.  "I'm kind of in a hurry.."  "oh sure, okay." and handed me to tubes.  Then to the check out register.  A girl was buying a soda, and this clerk was laughing joking, talking about something while I stood there, not real patient.  My back and legs were hurting.  Finally, the soda girl got her change and I was processed...30 minutes after I entered the store for a $2 item.  This needs fixing. In San Jose, 377 Royal Ave...</review><Resp>None<//Resp>< pics>

< review>
I have been shopping here for decades. BUT - this location has been going backwards in both stocked merchandise and management for the past 5 years. They have currently not restocked the shelves in a solid 2 weeks. MOST of the cashiers are brand new, untrained and stumble through the check-out process. This means a trip to this OSH location is a total gamble - typically meaning they don't have the simplest of items and you are GUARANTEED an unpleasant wait in line. I got SO frustrated yesterday I simply set what items I COULD find on the floor and walked out. Three registers were locked up with cashiers that had problems - with no management help in sight. Half of what I went there for  - wasn't in stock, after a 2 week wait and a phone conversation assuring me the merchandise had been delivered to the store.

Shop elsewhere.</review>

This is a great hardware store - O.S.H. is a staple in the Valley - and this location, while a little small is packed with an exceptional variety of tools, hardware, materials and all thr other items necessary to create, repair and make home more "Home."  The store is well stocked, well kept, and the service is dedicated to helping get what you need.<//Review>

<text>My favorite OSH. In fact I'm going there today. They have a lot of stuff, and the staff are very helpful. Hey people, how about treating store staff as colleagues rather than as servants?

I've yet to see one of the legendary OSHbots, they always seem to be "in the shop". The primary purpose of the OSH bots was going to be to lead people to the paint department, etc. But a decent map by the entrance would take care of that. Or, even a downloadable smartphone app since most people use smartphones these days.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Excellent lesson by Richard! He explained surfing in  a simple way that I will remember when I get back in the water. I will know what I’m aiming for & when I get it right. Very relaxed & easy time hanging out with a guy who enjoys sharing his love of surfing.<//text>

My daughter got up on the board so many times- so fun!  Definitely recommend this company- and if you can get Richard you should- he was so nice and professional.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dce0130aeeb865:0xac67272a343d6d24< /Gmap_id></record>

We enjoyed our first surfing experience with Kyle. We were able to pop up and catch good waves, thanks to our instructor! We are now planning to get our own board and wetsuit to continue surfing more. Thanks for a wonderful intro to surfing! Will return for more lessons.<//Review>

Easy to schedule, very responsive and communicative, and outstanding service. I bought a 2 hour lesson for my sons 12 birthday and he had an absolute BLAST. It was his favorite gift by far, and after the lesson he was beaming. He had a great time, learned a lot, and it really boosted his confidence. He was up and surfing after just minutes in the water! 10/10 would recommend.<//review>

The 8’ waves way out there were intimidating but I felt prepared with the safety measures he taught me and I rode in that La Bomba Southern Hemi Swell!! Can’t wait to come back for another ride! Highly recommend to anyone interested!!</Text>< pictures>

<review>Dave made a little surfer out of my girl in one session! She was very hesitant, but he made it relaxed and fun so that she fully engaged. She literally didn’t stop smiling the whole time and can’t wait to do it again!</review>< pictures>

Had a blast with this company. My friend and I called and Jason scheduled us for the next day. Our instructor, Dane, was local, knowledgeable, and made sure we had fun. Both my friend and I were able to get up and we had great waves. Highly recommend!< /text>

< Review>
Dane was a great teacher. Our whole experience from booking our daughters surf lesson to completing the lesson was fantastic. We have one other experience with a different company to compare  with and we will most definitely return to Learn to Surf. Dane informed us on wetsuits, the thickness differences and why, How to put on a wet suit and was very patient. He answered our questions on boards and where to buy and what to look for and did not give us the most expensive name brand ideas or options. He shared with us whatt beaches are safe for first or new surfers. He taught our daughter about rip tides and how to ride that out. He was not worried about being on a board himself but totally focused on his student. He finished the lesson at the van and by the end of the two hours we left feeling like we met a new friend. Our daughter was nervous at first and ended relaxed and excited to return for more.  We will most definitely return and bring friends. And who knows the non-surfing fans in our family just might snag a lesson up at big bear too and learn to snow board through Learn to Surf. 😀<//Review>

We can’t say enough about how much we loved our experiences (love it so much we took two lessons in 3 days!) with Learn to Surf. Our 13 year old daughter is a beginner and they did a fantastic job helping her gain confidence and skill. The staff is professional and the instructors are great at their craft, fun, careful and encouraging. They went out of their way to help make our vacation extra special. The Newport and Huntington beaches were beautiful and we consider the surf lessons to be the highlight of our trip. This is a top notch group and we highly recommend them!<//Text>

<review>We had such a great experience! Awesome service. Easy to book. Our instructor Brandon provided great one-on-one help to our nine-year-old daughter. She was able to stand up several times despite a difficult high tide. Definitely a worthwhile way to spend the morning. Super memorable experience.<//review>< Pics>

Wonderful experience!  1. My call was ACTUALLY answered! Jason is professional,  approachable and focused on meeting the needs of the client.  Top notch response and business! After booking, email confirmation and directions texted within 5 minutes.  I knew where to go, what to expect AND my hellcats would be in great hands.  2. No surprises! Great location (even with bigger waves it's shallow and my boys had plenty of "long rides"). Equipment was top of the line, easy for boys to carry and maneuver. 3. The instructor (Brock) was AWESOME!  Engaged two "competitive" brothers (ages 9 & 10) with different learning styles and personalities(!) in a way that left both feeling it was, "the best day EVER!" Brock was mindful of ones hesitation and helped his confidence grow.  He reinforced general water safety and flexible problem solving while also getting them pumped and completely stoked on surfing!  This island girl couldn't be more pleased!  WARNING:  One lesson might end up costing more when you get hooked and then need to go buy your own gear ;)<//Review>

These are surfer dudes, not gift store owners who rent surfboards. The equipment is good for beginners, but their delivery van looks more like they might have a side hustle as housepainters. Again, these are surfers, so don't let the creep van detour you! I mean...these guys do need some help with marketing....but not surfing! Big wave Dave had us surfing right away. Felt very comfortable. He had us in some very manageable waves....my first surfing DIY experience in Oregon left a sour taste in my mouth, but Big wave Dave and Southern California waves made me ready to go again! Highly recommended.<//Review>

I got this lesson for my wife for her birthday.  She loved it and was standing and riding waves in the first 30 minutes.  She said it was the one of the best days of her life. She had so much fun and the instructor was incredibly skilled and friendly. Totally recommend this company!</text>

<Text>Great surf lesson with a bunch of amazing instructors out there I brought a group of my friends down to the beach and we had never surfed before.  2 really cool instructors Chad and Zack took us out for one of the best times of my life.  The boards they had we big enough to float me...im over 200 pounds and I feel like I walked away from the lesson with a new understanding of the ocean and how to surf. Thanks guys I will be back.<//Text>< Pictures>

Even though we ate it quite a few times, Will was really encouraging and helpful when it came to catching waves and giving us foundation skills for surfing. If you’re looking for a place to learn pick these guys over the competitors simply for the price, services, and staff.</text>< user_name>

< Review>
I had such an amazing experience surfing with Will. He is super calm, patient, clear & thorough in his instructions, helpful, and has tremendous physical strength & stamina, which was certainly needed on this crazy day! The current was stronger than I’ve ever witnessed, and the waves were so monstrous, only very experienced surfers could be out in them, so we were restricted to the shallow “foamies,” which were so strong they were literally knocking me off me feet. I would have been carried away numerous times if Will hadn’t told me to get up on the board and he fought the current, dragging me & the board out to the waves. He did this repeatedly for 2 hours!! Dedication and stamina!
With his instruction, I was able to get up with every wave, even if I didn’t always stay up for very long. By the end of our 2 hour session, we were both pretty exhausted, and in my mind I knew it would be my last wave. Thankfully, it was the BEST wave and BEST ride I had all day! I stayed up and rode to my destination, jumping up & down for joy when it was over!! It was EXHILARATING and well worth all the effort! We both agreed that this was the ride to end the day on. I would definitely go out with Will and his team again, and can’t wait to have my three daughters learn to surf with them too! (I’m proof that these guys CAN teach an old dog new tricks.) And I definitely recommend the picture package and the GoPro camera package. It was so amazing watching the videos later, as it looks different on video than I see it in my mind. And you can see what you’re doing right, and what areas you need to work on.< /Review>

Took a paddle board lesson with Dave as instructor over the weekend and had such a great experience! I grew up terrified of the ocean and never learned how to swim. I requested we stay on shallow water and the lesson took place in a beautiful area in Newport where the water was pretty shallow. Before my lesson, Dave showed me how to float in case I fell off the board, which I did! I slightly panicked when I fell but remembered what Dave thought me and was so proud of myself to be able to get back up on my own! Dave stuck around really close just in case so I felt really safe! It didn’t feel much like a lesson, but felt like we were just hanging out having some fun! My teenage nephew loved it too! I will definitely be going back and recommending this adventure to friends! Thank you Dave for helping me conquer my fears!</text>

<review>From start to finish, a great experience.  I was a little hesitant because there's no actual building to go to.  A van with all the boards and wetsuits and even sunscreen parks at the end of the street.  It worked out great.  Jason, who runs it and answers the phone, was professional and friendly and I felt confident by the end of the phone call that my kids were in good hands.  Because I booked for four, he threw in a second instructor for free so they'd all have more of a private lesson.  Next time, I'm including myself in the lesson!  The two instructors were top notch.  They are passionate about sharing the joy of surfing with others and are very knowledgeable.  Brock has an incredible story about how he ended up in Newport Beach.  Unfortunately, I didn't catch the other instructor's name (but can describe him to a tee) but next time we go I'm going to ask for either or both of them.  They got them up and riding waves and I could hear them cheering them on from the beach.  My kids are in their 20's and I couldn't have asked for a better experience.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dce0130aeeb865:0xac67272a343d6d24</GmapID></record>

<Text>We had a great time with Lewis.  He had a challenging setup working with two adults and an 11 year old.  Lewis spent most of his time with the 11 year old as the adults had some prior experience but we all stood up on our boards and rode them in.  The only thing I wish was different was having the option to keep the board and wetsuit for another couple of hours once we were familiar with catching waves.</Text>< gmap_id>

Brock and Jared were great!! We’ve taken about half a dozen surfing lessons all over the world and they were by far the best. They covered the basics of safety and catching a wave, but also explained how to find and catch a wave by ourselves by the end of the lesson. Great way of making the process easy, understandable and safe. We took my 15 year old niece for her first time and she got up on the first try and was catching her own waves by the end of the two hour lesson! Great experience, highly recommend.</Text>

<Review>My daughter and I had a WONDERFUL experience with Learn to Surf. I called  the morning of, having decided to give myself a surf lesson for my birthday, and having a hard time finding anyone who could fit me in. Jason was determined to fit me in. Our instructor, Ben, could not have been nicer. I appreciated that he took technique and safety very seriously in the initial lesson on the sand. In the water he watched us closely and commented on what we could improve each time. When we were struggling with a certain part of getting up, he took us back to the sand to practice again. We were much improved after taking that break to fix our form. It was so fun and we learned so much! I actually loved that we just met them at a van--that I felt there was no unnecessary markup. The van had our wetsuits and boards, and we were able to lock our valuables in. I really liked the choice of beach, as it was a learning beach that wasn't intimidating. We will definitely be back for more lessons from Learn to Surf!< /Review>< pictures>

there were 4 of us that took lessons, first of all we had a GREAT TIME!!! there were 2 instructors, unfortunately I am very bad with names so I can't give their names but one instructor was from the Canary Islands the other was from San Clemente, anyone who is surfing for the first time probably knows that you do not learn to surf in 1 lesson, but I think what you are finding out is are you interested in continuing to learn, our instructors were incredibly nice and patient, as bad as we all were they continued to praise us any time we were even remotely  close to doing anything that resembled surfing, they even praised us for the effort we were giving, safety was their first order of business everything was explained in detail on shore and I felt confident that my family was safe while under the instruction of these two gentlemen, the boards were supplied as well as wet suits, we originally were scheduled to take the lesson at Huntington Beach, when we were called it was recommended that we take the lesson at Newport Beach because the current and waves were not as strong, that turned out to be a great suggestion as the location was much less crowded and the conditions were definitely  safer, I can't say enough good things about our experience, if you are planning lessons these are the right people, thanks for the great time and experience!</text>

Purchased a private 2-Hour lesson for my daughter while in Newport Beach. She is only 6 and absolutely loved it! Repeatedly said how nice her instructor was to her. Highly recommend Learn to surf.< /Review>

First off I have to say that this experience exceeded my expectations 100%! Brock showed me all the ropes and I was up on that board first try! I could not have been more excited! Brock was absolutely fantastic... you can feel his love for surfing and respect for the ocean in how he teaches! For anyone looking for a killer lesson and hoping to get up and actually surf.. these guys are LEGIT! Thank you Brock and of course Jason, for making my little solo adventure
A-mazing ♥️< /text>

I just took my daughter this past Thursday and she had the best experience.  She had never surfed before and was standing in less than ten minutes.  Andy, her coach, was supportive and encouraging.  I plan on going back for my son.  Great time!!!<//Text>

From start to finish- it was an incredible experience. We had a group of 4 with no surfing experience and aging from 13 years old to 39 years old. Everyone in our group was able to ride a wave by ourselves by the end. The instructors were awesome!</Review>

It was my first surfing lesson in the US.
I’ve learned from Brock who’s been surfed 10years.
He taught and guided me the safety and how to surf as a beginner.
I've tried another surf workshop before once, I’ve never popped up.
But then in this lesson, I've pop up many times and I enjoyed it with him.
I felt intimidated about learning new sports before, but now I found it is fun and I'd like to keep try surfing.
Thanks for cheering and guiding!</Review>

Brock was awsome with the kids but I didn't get what was discussed and what I was paying for. I wanted to book off a deal site for a go pro package for my daughter first time surfing so I called to ask some questions. Then I was told I'd get the same deal booking directly. I did that for two days and only got the go pro package for one day and didn't receive photos yet it been two days since. :( really said I didn't get the captures I was looking for.< /Review>

We were on vacation in Huntington Beach and my daughter decided she wanted to learn to surf. We went to a place right on the beach and arranged something for that Saturday. Came back Saturday morning only to figure find that their instructor went to Hawaii. I'm guessing they should have know that before Saturday. Anyway I called learn to surf and I'm so happy I did. She spent two hours with Chad learning about surfing the ocean, feeling the ocean and was up on like her 3rd or 4th wave. One more thing to add to the list of things my kids will never have to look back on in their life and say I wish I would have tried that. If you're in Huntington go locals like these guys way better than the mass market stuff on the beach. Thanks guys.<//Text>

Booked lessons for surfing and paddleboarding for a large group offsite.  The whole operation (main office back-and-forth, instructors, gear etc) was professional and we had no issues.  Our group loved the event and I would definitely recommend Learn to Surf.  Thanks Jason and team! :)</review>

It was really difficult on deciding on which surf school to choose because there are so many options out there on yelp. However, after reading about Learn to Surf and Jason's safety training in the Navy, I decided to go with him. He was really thorough and able to communicate all the terms associated with surfing. I had no idea how complex surfing was, but he broke it down very simply. I learned basic positioning and paddling techniques and half way through my lesson, I was riding every wave I paddled into. I'd definitely go back to learn to surf and I recommend anyone trying surfing for the first time to check out this place.</text>

Justin is super informative when it comes to surfing. He helps you search for the perfect wave and makes it fun and easy to surf. He is all about safety and explains the proper techniques of how to surf. Would highly recommend!< /Review>

<Name>Mallory Tomaszewski< /Name><date>1441488619884<//date><rate>5</rate><text>I have multiple great experiences with the Learn to Surf team in Huntington Beach. As a transplant from the midwest, I felt as a new OC resident learning to surf was a must! Jason and his team of instructors have been able to make me feel comfortable and safe in the water while learning how to paddle and stand up on waves (and I am very uncoordinated!). I have had multiple lessons with Jason (the owner) and some of his other instructors as well. They are helping me perfect and grow my skills as a surfer! Thanks guys!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Professional purveyors of surf lessons...we only hire the best most trained instructors who's main focus is on safety.  I adapted my training program from the training I went through in the US Navy.  I went through both SEAL and dive school training and make sure all my instructors go through a battery of tests to make sure you are safe during your surf lesson.  A lot of other surf schools make outrageous claims of being the best out there, but have no credentials to back up their assertions.  I am college educated and received my degree from the University of Hawaii where I rode every big wave on the island of Oahu.  Come train with us and have the best surfing experience of your life.

Can't say enough about Jason and his instructors. Whether it be a party of kids or 1 on 1, Jason knows how get the job done. If you want an instructor that genuinely cares about each of his students. This is your guy!< /Text>

There's a grocery store right across and a gasoline station, so it is like a one-stop-shop. The restaurant has good customer service, too. The place is big, and you can hold parties where they had private rooms, too. We also call them for deliveries at home, pretty fast and good service! Highly recommended!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

First, it’s reheated slice and indeed not what I expected. Secondly, reheating make the edge harder (maybe good for people who love crispy taste but definitely not for me).
By the way, buffalo wings are tasty but too salty. Hope they can improve that.< /review>

Their pizza is always delicious, but typically greasy and soft in the centers and super crunchy on the edges (I never mind crunch, just greasy centers). Their wings are decent in taste, but they’re extremely tiny. One of ours even came partly torn, like someone had grabbed it and torn it apart. Not terrible, but not the greatest.< /Text>

We were NOT disappointed! The prices are higher than your average chain (like Pizza Hut, Domino's, etc) but the quality is unmatched. Ingredients are super fresh, delicious and the crust is perfect. Service is also really good! Definitely recommend you stop by for a good slice or whole pizza. By the way, the large pizza is REALLLLLY large!!< /Text>

There are plenty of tables and chairs to sit at and a large selection of ready made pizzas to choose from. You can even order your own whole personal pizza with any toppings you like. The pizza slices we asked for were supposedly heated up but given to us cold. The crust was sloppy and the toppings and sauce not very tasty. We were there with a large group and a lot of the others also experienced the same sloppy pizza slices.<//Review>< Pics>

2020: Good place to grab a meal. Friendly staff - as always dab a napkin on the pizza. For as long as I've known a Pizza My Heart their pizza sweat! Great Pizza nonetheless. Love the food and would recommend going there personally but if must try their online takeout.</review>

Pizza is average in taste. Pizza menu covers all the usual pizza favorites, including for vegan and vegetarians. Casual eatery. Can buy either by the slice or a whole pie in person, over the phone, online, and on Door Dash.

Soda is one size, one price with free refills.

One of the few places in Downtown San Jose that is opened late throughout the week.

Street parking only. Walking distance to SJSU.</text>

Food and drinks wise, love their set meal of a salad and slice of pizza with free drink, allows me to eat healthily yet indulge a bit because who doesn’t love 🍕😉 crust is just nice for me, thin enough so it’s not doughy but has substance and is crispy. Toppings are ample and they have a variety of flavours available. Salads are fresh and substantial too for the price. Love that they have free flow sauces! As for drinks, I could get a non sweet option of iced tea which is great.

Wasn’t sure if the Nutella pizza was just because of my group or they actually do offer it, but my gosh it blew my mind and I ate 3 pieces.

Place is also spacious and clean, well lit and centrally located.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMB0u9a7tQcdmC-EnnlaTNani2CWhua4OJ7mVTb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYTiVeshQiqHJzrYc1hgGvZfQR73jocf5ThiRq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9FfI_kJ2zEfplSpuLxzsbJLpL2mxGDbmm5f9Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAmkkdbeS3y19MAHYjGvEKGTOO_kdFtWE0eeEB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLg07dczvxxrsUlzxJg1GlzigCJDG3wCkEPpwq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPAJ6C7TNpA2wq9zlrwEa882D_iwxBm8M1uuTE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEnDv-Dp-HKotmdZbVBFHFuFlYt0vMt7XVvWsu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN97tNAXkgu5hG1gIRv5C46bF7i2_UTpsTcDiEv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVF3LLjRuh4AUSn_FZ1U50HCtcqwUPjrLT6FTT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPd6SychWN7xHZDBM32TcKXJSBNCvAhXe9Y4qbt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdTUxwJor9upZl0PuJMasUmKP2mRuYb5K9P6yz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Great tasting Pizza place near our hotel in San Jose. College vide with students seemingly working in there. A little pricey. Busy on a Friday evening. Street parking, luckily got a spot a block away.<//review>

First time here, visited with a group LGs after a photo walk. Restaurant is quite spacious. You have an option to order Pizza slice which is already made or a whole pie. Staff was friendly, service was reasonably quick. Pizza was very tasty too. Also impressed with how they quickly served our large group.< /review>

Probably not the best pizza for an Italian taste, but for sure they are a great place. We had a party with more than 50 people. They managed everything easily, and were available to prepare some customized pizza for us, even if it was not on the menu. The place is nice and extremely friendly. Accessible to disabled on wheelchairs, and respectful of the environment<//Review>

We bought a large group into this restaurant and they were very accommodating. They were able to provide pizza for everyone pretty quickly and serve beer/soda. There was also a surprising number of seats that worked very well with the large group. Everyone was able to sit down and also walk around to mingle with others. This is a great place to bring a group.</Review>

< Review>
I avoided this place for a while because the prices seemed high, especially for whole pizzas. On "pi" day (3/14) we got a coupon for Pieology. The line was out the door, all day! Since we had planned on pizza for dinner we decided to go to pizza my heart instead. We were NOT disappointed! The prices are higher than your average chain (like Pizza Hut, Domino's, etc) but the quality is unmatched. Ingredients are super fresh, delicious and the crust is perfect. Service is also really good! Definitely recommend you stop by for a good slice or whole pizza. By the way, the large pizza is REALLLLLY large!!< /Review>

Yes the cheese can 'make it soggy' but I can confirm that the big sur, pineapple, chicken bacon, plain cheese, and pepperoni never came out soggy. The extra solidity helps and it is delicious.

Hands down, the best PMH in the Bay. Customer service is always A+ and service is even better, SS even. But regardless of these trying times we are in, Scott makes it all better. He is pleasant on the phone and always offering helpful service. The whole crew here is the best!<//Review><date>1613369572468</date></record></dataset><record>

Recommended- Portabello mushroom is excellent, when it is freshly baked and not been sitting long. I like it enough to come here just to eat only that.

Good - Chicken-bacon.  4th Street pizza does chicken better.

OK - Vegetarian. I prefer Rosies NY Pizza better, on the Alameda.< /text>

We visited this location during a Furry Convention (FC 2020) their customer service was excellent and they were definitely quick to bring food out to use despite them being busy and we ordered two whole pizza. Their pizza itself is also fantastic, really nice New York style pizza cooked right.</Review>

<Review>"like this the most amazing pizza that I have ever had in my life. The sauce is so good that you can taste the love the people put in making quality pizza. The staff is as amazing as the pizza. I left leaving like I New the guy who runs this joint because he recommended the exact pizza that would satisfy my hunger! Will go again and recommend. " wise the owner could play a little bit of interpol or little of the stills on the radio."will go again. And recommend. Also great place to consider taking your best mate for a surprise birthday celebration!< /Review>< name>

Tried this place out one year for Fanime, and now I always get it when I come out. The pizza is great, and is one of the few places where it doesn't upset my stomach, which is great as well! The prices are a bit more than other places, but its well worth it. Only shame this year was that our hotel was too far to order it, which was a real shame, hopefully next year we fix that!</Text>

<rating>4</rating><review>The pizza here is pretty reliably good, esp. if you like New York style pizza that you can fold and eat. I like the specialty menu items, they're creative and have options for both meat eaters and vegetarians. Good value for the money. The booths aren't always clean, but the service is fast and friendly.< /review><username>Jessica Stiles< /username>< user>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>I've been to Pizza My Heart a couple times now. I consider myself a big pizza fan, and I can get pretty excited about certain pizza places. I'm lucky in my hometown to have a large variety of different style pizza joints. There's one kind though that I feel is under represented and that's why I love visiting San Jose. I get excited for Pizza by the Heart because of a couple main things. The first thing I enjoy about this place is the size of the slices. These things are huge, and I think the average person can get a good meal with one slice, but you really need more than just one! The other thing I especially like about Pizza by the Heart is how messy these slices can be. You'll have grease dripping down your fingers, dripping down your chin.. it's a mess. I love it though, a huge greasy slice of pizza. Some might have an issue with the amount of grease or mess you get with these slices, but I love it.. many others do, this place can get pretty busy. I'm a creature of habit and always get the same type of pizza, so I can safely say pepperoni is good. The other flavours you'll have to see for yourself. One star deducted because it's really tough to do a perfect pizza. 4 stars is great though.< /Review>< Pictures>

Nicest Pizza My Heart I've been to. I remember coming here almost 20 years ago. They still have the $5 slice+t-shirt combo. My wife and I have to eat gluten-free now and they have the GF crust option. Quick service, knowledgeable staff and a large clean restaurant. Even got to watch some overtime playoff basketball.</text>

Good pizza with friendly service. After the remodel, the flow is much better. It doesn't get as crowded in the ordering area. There's always a decent amount of pizza by the slice, but it's almost always the same usual suspects. And there might only be one slice of many of the kinds. The pick your adventure soda machine just means the person in front of you will take 10 minutes to get their drink. Big seating area, with many tables.< /Review>

<text>Pizza was hot and plentiful.  Good flavor
Parking can be a challenge though I was lucky as there were several spots available on a Tuesday at approximately 7pm.
Clean inside establishment with plenty of seating choices.< /text><GmapID>0x808fccba2a00170f:0xf8b8073644fd6a36< /GmapID><user_name>Jack Hinshaw< /user_name><response>None</response>< UserId.>

<Review>The Beacon and Black Fig a great pizza for a change.  This small pizza chain has a good product with a unique pizza menu.  Staying in one of the Airport hotels you will need to call in the order because the online system will not recognize the address as being inside the delivery area.    The staff on the phone was courteous and helpful as was the delivery driver who called prior to his arrival.  It was hot and the crust was done correctly (not burnt or soggy). Topping are generously distributed and a small is more than enough for one.
A great find at a reasonable price for the quality of ingredients.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808fccba2a00170f:0xf8b8073644fd6a36< /Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
The greatest pizza place in all of the Bay Area and that is my own damn opinion. This place saved my ass during my wife's pregnancy and we had we're too tired to cook anything. For non locals I recommend the Pesto pizzas and the cheese and mushroom pizzas! And don't forget your salad!<//Review>

<text>Fun and casual place to get some nice pizza with friends. Decent selection of pizza types along with a chill, laid-back atmosphere makes this a great place to stop in for dinner. Plus, the pizza being served on frisbees was a fun little bonus that I thought was really cool.<//text><user_id>100814763190613942272<//user_id>< gmap_id>

Pizza My Heart is one the best pizza places in DTSJ. The location is perfect if you're a student, or finishing up a day of shopping. The staff are friendly, competent, and capable. I was there last Friday. My girlfriend and I each ordered a slice. After the cashier discovered he had burned our pizza a bit, he apologized and offered the burned slices along with our new ones. That may not seem like a huge deal, but I was happy that he offered.

Eating in the restaurant is pretty standard. Unless the place is packed with students, the  volume never goes above a dull roar. The pizza is delicious (I reccomend the Big Sur if you've never tried it), and the prices are fairly reasonable. If you're in the area, it's definitely worth a try.< /Text>

We usually came here to get some pizza before going to the concert in SJSU. Great selection of pizzas and salads and they taste great. There are a couple big TVs playing sports games. The place is not too big and it gets full easily especially if there are some events around or a sports game going on TV.< /text>

Consider this review before eating here. We noticed that an employee was trying to wipe down the counters, but the cloth that she was using touched multiple slices of pizza. When confronted, the employee stated that they “do that all the time”. Also, another employee would use the same spatula to move pizzas onto the stone. Completely unsanitary! Then, my grandmother ordered a slice of pizza, and she has two napkins covered in grease. This place is absolutely disgusting.< /Text>

< Review>
Probably the best pizza in the downtown area. (Although I am partial to the thin - NY style slice (and this is the only good NY slice in downtown - the area seems to lean more to the Chicago style). If you are feeling adventurous and want to leave the downtown area - check out Bibo's NY Pizza - just shy of walking distance from Pizza My Heart.</Review>

Pizza my Heart makes a great slice of pie. Running around $4 a slice, 1 piece is enough for a light meal, 2 may be required if you're quite hungry. Will be taking friends here.< /Review>

Located across the street from San Jose State University,Pizza My Heart is very popular with the college students looking to get a bite to eat or sitting down with friends and family...The Staff are extremely helpful and friendly and they serve fresh salads daily, pizza can served by the slice/whole and they welcome you with a smile,bring yourself,family or friends and enjoy the different types of pizza they serve!!!!< /text>

This place is ridiculous

My sinor father asked to use the restroom

The guy who answered the door told hin they were closed and he couldnt use the restroom

They may have been closed hovever there were at least 15 people inside SITTING DOWN AND EATING PIZZA.

I hope it was worth it to lose 3 customers</text>

Okay.  Nothing special.  I did get $20 from a snob because he thought we were poor and couldnt pay fot our food when a company's pre paid card didn't work.  Also, they ask for a tip for putting your pizza in the oven. Awkward to.cross off tip on the credit card invoice with the guy hovering over.</Text>

Very good tasting thin slice pizzas.  Been coming here for years and so far have been consistent in quality and service.  Popular stop for the SJSU students.  Ordering by the slice from the available pies behind the counter is a pretty good deal, and the servings are generous.  Big Sur and wingnut are tasty picks.< /review>

Our pesto pizza and tomato-cheese pizza was a sad affair. It's unfortunate considering its quite assesscible after class.

(Translated by Google) Great place to eat pizza with other people. The staff was courteous and very helpful. The prices are not low but the pizza is good. I didn't like the bacon and pineapple pizza but it's a personal taste. The sofas are excellent but for up to 6 people per table.

Ottimo posto per mangiare una pizza in compagnia di altra gente. Il personale è stato cortese e molto disponibile. I prezzi non sono bassi ma la pizza è buona. Non mi è piaciuta la pizza con bacon e ananas ma è un gusto personale. I divanetti sono ottimi ma per massimo 6 persone per ogni tavolo.< /review>

(Translated by Google) You can enjoy pizza at a reasonable price. You can ask in a single unit or in the hall. There were three types of hall sizes, but I took it home because there were many minimum sizes. There are a wide variety of pizzas, which correspond to the vegetarian menu, but there was no halal menu. I think this is a good place to enjoy together with many people. It was a very pleasant atmosphere with easy-to-understand explanations by the store clerk, good paste and a lot of fun.

The number of seats is large, so if you have about 30 people, you can enter without problems. There were several seats outside, but there were tables and chairs.

(Original)
リーズナブルにピザを楽しむことができます。一切れ単位で頼むこともホールで頼むこともできます。ホールのサイズは三種類ありましたが、私は最小サイズでも多かったので持ち帰りました。ピザの種類が豊富で、ベジタリアンメニューに対応していますがハラールメニューはありませんでした。沢山の人と一緒に楽しむのに向いているお店だと思います。店員さんの説明もわかりやすく、ノリがよく、非常に楽しい雰囲気のお店でした。

席数は多く、30人程度であれば問題なく入ることができると思います。外にも数席ですがテーブルと椅子が置かれていました。< /Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Good American pizzeria. The place is very spacious and has many tables, we brought a nice group of people and they managed to serve without problems, there was room for everyone. The pizza is good and not expensive for the local average. The staff is polite and very helpful, they even accommodated us on special requests, availability permitting. They make takeaway pizza. They also have some space on the street.

Buona pizzeria americana. Il posto e' molto spazioso ed ha tanti tavoli, abbiamo portato un bel gruppo di persone e ci sono riusciti a servire senza intoppi, c'era posto per tutti. La pizza e' buona e non e' costosa per la media locale. Il personale e' gentile e molto disponibile, ci hanno anche accontentato su richieste particolari disponibilita' permettendo. Fanno pizza da asporto. Hanno anche un po' di spazio sulla strada.<//Text>< user_name>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I loved this pizzeria !! They offer a wide variety of pizzas per serving, among which the delicious vegetable pizza stands out.
In addition, there are national and imported soft drinks and beers.
The attention is agile and cordial.
There are comfortable tables and boxes to sit, also a reserved for private events. The eclectic decoration includes photographs, memorabilia and paintings with the distinctions achieved by this popular place.

<Text>(Translated by Google) The place is quite large, seemingly well-known pizza places to eat in this town.

How to make a pizza dangat amazing, really just made the current incoming orders. And they do not use ovens but use roasted stoves like how to cook real pizza in their home country.

That night I ordered a Caesar Salad. The packaging includes cheese and dressing. Fresh and abundant vegetables, as well as pieces of chicken meat. Equipped with dry bread slices, this salad is really filling.

Vanda and our group's laughter and skilled restaurant attendants made the evening perfect for us, perfecto!

(Original)
Tempat ini lumayan besar, nampaknya tempat makan pizza terkenal di kota ini.

Caranya bikin pizza dangat menakjubkan, benar-benar baru dibikin saat pesanan masuk. Dan mereka tidak memakai oven tetapi memakai tungku bakar seperti cara memasak pizza yang asli di negara asalnya.

Malam itu saya memesan Caesar Salad. Dalam packingannya sudah termasuk keju dan dressingnya. Sayurannya segar dan melimpah, demikian pula potongan daging ayamnya. Dilengkapi dengan potongan roti kering, salad ini sungguh mengenyangkan.

Vanda tawa rombongan kami dan para petugas restoran yang trampil membuat malam itu srmpurna bagi kami, perfecto!< /Text>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) The pizza is really good. No wonder Pizza My Heart just clears the Worlds Best Pizza awards. And no wonder that we received this recommendation from an Italian. Here it tastes at least as good as in Italy itself.

Die Pizza ist richtig gut. Kein Wunder, wenn Pizza My Heart die Auszeichnungen für die Worlds Best Pizza nur so abräumen. Und auch kein Wunder, dass wir von einem Italiener diese Empfehlung bekommen haben. Hier schmeckt es mindestens genauso gut wie in Italien selbst.</review>
