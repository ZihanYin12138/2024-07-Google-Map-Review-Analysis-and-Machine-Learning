Dentist was friendly & informative.

You should take the time to practice customer service skills as well as possibly re-learn how to have a conversation.

As a patient trying to communicate with you was not easy. I had to break down and literally tell you to give me a minute to speak without you speaking over me.
I felt that was not only rude but made it unclear as to what my options for treatment.

If I didn’t call back today, I would not have found the information that helped me when I called today.</Review>< Time>

I had to wait a few days before I left a review I’m still upset. First of all they allowed some person to give authorization for my son to have a filling which also means they needed to give him something to numb his mouth. They spoke to allowed him to sign a consent form and did work on my son’s mouth and after they were done asked me for consent. The doctor then came out and told me I was informed because I signed again they spoke to someone else and allowed him to sign not to mention we are African American. I’m still upset and they need a more diverse staff. I can go on but since I have to work and I protect my peace and space I’ll stop.And since COVID they should be more careful.<//Text>

<review>This is the best dentist and office I've ever been too. They are fair in pricing and work with you if you don't have enough money. The customer service is excellent, when it comes to billing the spell it out all for ya without missing a beat. You know exactly what is being done and how much it cost.< /review><date>1601930118101< /date>< Pics>

<text>It was not a good experience. The problem star in the waiting room, people complaining about the bill and miscommunication. I make an appointment for check up and cleaning and the doctor recommendation was to have a deep cleaning that require antibiotics, I never heard smoothing like that, l don't see necessary. They took more that 20 xray, they don't have updated equipment, I was concern about that.</text>< date>

I have been with Bright Now Dental for two years and have been very pleased with their service, professionalism, and communication.  I have had everything done from twice-a-year cleaning to a new crown replacement.  The Tech staff, Dental Assistants, and Dentists are first-rate.  Making appointments is easy and I have yet to really wait in the waiting room for my scheduled appointment.  The Office Staff is very good as is their communication for appointments.  The Dental staff are friendly and very competent.  My Dentist is excellent.  Her manner and work is some of the best I have ever had.  If you are looking for a Dental Group, I highly recommend Bright Now Dental.</review>

I am really happy with Bright Now Dental in Lone Tree specially with their Hygenist Miss Barbara (smooth and professional) and desk team Miss Joy.  They accept almost all insurance. The main thing that really got me with them is that they are honest and they don't try to rip you off with unnecessary spending.  They don't try to make money out of you and come up with things that will make spend money on compare to other Dental places.    My wife and I was most impressed with their selection of good Hygenist that really care about helping.  Also, they some other Dental places requires you do many things before they would do cleaning on you, spend on this and spend on that before they do cleaning. Thank you Ms. Barbara and Joy, we hope to be working with you for a while.<//Text>

<review>The worst service!
I went in for a cleaning.
The place was empty.
After my x-rays and visit with the dentist, she asked me to wait in the waiting room until the hygienist was ready to take me back for my teeth cleaning. After 30 minutes of waiting, the receptionist asked why I was still here. I explained and she went to find answers. She returned and explained they all went to lunch and asked if I would come back in one and a half hours later!?!?!
Left to never to return.
Maybe she didn't like that I wouldn't pay $1,000 (out-of-pocket) for a filling and crown until I got a second opinion.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<review>Very interesting as I read through the reviews.  I have been coming to this dental office for at least a couple of years.  Like everywhere some days are more busy than others so they staff may not seem as chatty.  I am okay with this as sometimes I am the one waiting and I wouldn’t want to wait longer than necessary just so everyone can feel like they received enough attention.  I travel a lot so the staff does everything they can to work around my hectic flight plans.  They will even work to squeeze me in if necessary.  As to the service I have always felt well taken care of while visiting.  My wait time has been minimal compared to other dentist locations.  I also feel like when I am in the chair I am always given options to my care, bottom line its my teeth.  I have always been presented with the cost (requiring my signature) before I get a procedure done.  I understand the deep cleaning is a pain in the butt and expensive, but even for that I was given an option.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

STAY AWAY.
Went in to get my all 4 of my wisdom teeth extracted on a Wednesday. The surgeon numbed my entire mouth, when I asked if I could swallow the surgeon started he would turn the suction on and would suction the saliva. That’s when the surgeon who was already 10-15 min late walking into the office for my appointment realized that the suction machine in the entire office didn’t work. The office manager then stated that it had stopped working the day before but had gotten “fixed”. I understand that machines break down, what I am totally not okay with is the negligence the office manager had by not checking the machine when she walked in on Wed morning. I was sent home that day with my entire mouth completely numb and a two page list of other surgeons to call to see if I could get an appointment within that week as I had ready requested time off work. Fortunately a completely different office/company was able to fit me into there schedule for the following day. Before leaving this place I was told to disregard a bill I would be getting in the mail for $11, I received a bill late February which was disregarded. Mid March and I received a second notice for the same bill I was told to “disregard”. Not only are they negligent but they don’t stick to their word after making a huge mistake.</text>

<text>The cleaning went great once they actually get started. EVERY TIME I have an appointment they don’t start anything till at least 45 minutes from your appointment start time. Yesterday they didn’t call our name to go back until 30 minutes after my appointment start time. The time before that, they brought us back 30 minutes after our appointment time to sit in the dental chairs and an hour went by and no one had started my cleaning, I had other appointments to go to so I left without my cleaning. So make sure you leave yourself plenty of time because your 30 minute cleaning could not be finished for 2 hours after your appointment time.</text>< userid>

I tried to give them a chance. Was seen about 30 minutes after my appointment time. I have a tooth that is pretty much beyond saving. Instead of talking about an extraction and bridge, the Dr. wanted to do a number of extensive procedures and if that didn't work they could always go back and do an extraction and bridge. I understand wanting to save a tooth, but at some point it just makes no sense. While it's not fraud -- it is very unethical and all about milking you for you what ever they can. I'm actually still waiting [2 weeks now] for a call back with the final cost information, was supposed to be called back the next day and wasn't. I would rather use my old dentist [that doesn't accept my insurance], than work with this place that will take my insurance.</Text>

<Gmap_id>0x808ff8b8fae2aa27:0x3b03472e3fe7e58f</Gmap_id><Review>Earlier this year I took my son in for a standard cleaning -  Day of visit he received x rays, never saw the doctor and the cleaning techs were so far behind he never got his teeth cleaned as it was now over a 2-hour wait in the chair and he needed to get to work in SF.  We were told that a technician called in sick and they were behind. He moved out of the country and never went back for the cleaning.

Fast forward to this month.  I schedule my first visit with the call center – hoping this visit will be better.  I take time off for work (late afternoon so I don’t miss much time), get to my appt with plenty of time to spare (paperwork completed to turn in).

First - the tech who took my x-rays did not seem to care about her job.  Second-The doctor checks my teeth tells me I need a filling and then says they cannot do the cleaning because it’s now too late in the day and there is someone else waiting to have their teeth cleaned and can we schedule another time.  I express my dissatisfaction because my time is valuable also and I specifically scheduled a cleaning with their call center.  They say they can try to squeeze me in on Saturday.  Strike 2.

If I could give this company a “0” I would.  Seriously, who schedules a cleaning with a dentist and the dentist office not be prepared to provide the service.  Two times in a row?  Bad planning on their part to provide for their patients.  I won't go back.</Review><date>1560361715473<//date><Pictures>None<//Pictures><name>Lynn C</name>< rating>

I was super nervous about returning to the dentist. I hadn’t been in 7 or 8 years due to lack of insurance, time, I can go on... But my experience was overall positive. The entire staff was super kind. I had minimal wait time. The cleaning even went well for not having been in years. I look forward to returning.<//review>

<Text>My AARP dental insurance led me here. Very good care and nice staff. Just wish they had name badges to make it more personal. Hard to remember names when visits are so far between.

Dr Thampy is excellent!  I needed a tooth pulled and was referred to her by a friend. I didn’t feel the shot or realize the tooth was out till she told me that she was done! She even called the next day to check on me ! Very thankful for this wonderful service!</Text>

< Review>
I ended up going to a different dentist for a second opinion after coming here because the dentist (here) told me I have an issue with my gum and needed an especial treatment and I need to pay out-of-pocket for anesthetic.  I was surprised when she said that so I seek a second opinion.  After getting the second opinion, it appears that my gum is healthy and no issues.  I do NOT recommend this dentist..</Review>

<Review>They are always very gentle with me and considerate to my needs.  They go above and beyond. My dentist is helping me getting over my fear of being in her chair. I've gone from crying hysterically every time because of being traumatized by Western Dental when they left a file in my mouth and caused me extreme pain, but not at Bright Now Dental. They always make sure I'm comfortable and I so appreciate them😘😘😘< /Review>< pictures>

Oh my goodness how do I count the ways how wonderful Bright Now! Dental is!!!!! The front desk staff---- "especially JOY" was so accommodating, and friendly faces soak up the room 😄I am an old lady and have seen some dentist in my lifetime, huge kudos to Dr. Ebrahimi...probably the greatest dentist I have seen. Awesome bedside manner and he explains everything he does to make you feel comfortable. Please stay wonderful!!!!<//Text>

i have recieved the best care. I had broke off my front crown on a thurs afternoon and was leaving fri early on vacation. I called and they got me in that same day and gave me a temporary fix until i could come back the following week. When i went in that following week, not only did they fixed my broken tooth but worked with me financially to be able to fix my whole smile. I have had the best experience with Dr. Thampy she is kind and very patient. I am a patient for life.< /review>

<text>I was skeptical at first with their pricing until I compared them to others.  My wife had her braces done for half the price our friends paid on getting theirs.  They are also up to date with technologies they use on their clinics.  Everyone is professional and actually care for our dental health.  They always gave us options that works for us best.  They listen and takes their time until we are sure we are satisfied!! I highly recommend Brightnow Dental in Antioch!! They made us feel welcome. Thank Antioch Brightnow Dental Team!!

(Translated by Google) This dentist's office is NOT efficient. I wove a crown in tracy's office and I stopped calling them that if they could wear it again, it is the same company that did my job before. They didn't want to do it. Do not spend your money with Dr who does not want to greet people and they are not cheap to say that money will be saved. NOT RECOMMENDING IT.

(Original)
Esta officiana de dentists NO es efficiente me hise una corona en la officina de tracy y se me callo los llame que si podian ponermela otra vez pues es la misma compania que me hiso el trabajo anteriormente NO quisieron haserla . No gaste su dinero con Dr que no quieren halludar a la gente y no son Baratos para desir que se ahorrara dinero. NO LA RECOMIENDO.</Text>

<Text>I walked in and really was greeted, I was asked to fill out a couple of forms. I only had to wait about 15 minutes before they saw me for a drug test. The girl that administrated the test was very kind. I was only there for about five minutes for the test and I received a follow up instructions from Concentra.

I would highly Recommend them. A+<//Text>< pics>

The doctor i had really made the hole difference, he was a middle age Asian American Gentlemen who did an awsome job. When I had to take the physical he was the first doctor to ever make the hernia check not WIRED or over kill( thank God)......
If your work sends you here relax the people her are on ther A+ work game and will do an excellent job taking care of you.
All you have to do is suit up and show up and they get the job done!</text>

We ( my wife and I both) went in for a job related drug test.Girl ,sorry can't remember name, at front desk was very helpful, curteous, well mannered and quite efficient.  Was only waiting for approx. 15 minutes before being called in to exam room. Dr.s name was Zack. Super nice and very professional. Had to do hair test. Unable to see what was going on behind me so he let me know every step he was doing. My wife and I both had a really great experience. Would definitely recommend this Concentra.</Text>

< Review>
I was in so much pain over last 24hrs couldn't walk or move without pain in lower back. I went to clinic for help to alleviate pain. The staff are compassionate and caring people. Liz is very so helpful with questions or concerns about authorization or paperwork I need. I love that. Dr Wang treated me with dignity and respect and is very compassionate about me getting better! Zack was so gracious and helped me be at ease without causing more pain and discomfort. I had tears of pain that turned into tears of gratitude later that day. I was given a shot for pain ,back brace and ice packs, therapeutic patches to help support and alleviate my  condition. My Spirit was uplifted even during this difficult time! Thank you Jesus for Dr Wang and his staff...< /Review>

<Response>None<//Response><Pics>None< /Pics><review>I went to Concentra for a pre employment health screen. Everything was fine until I went inside to get my blood drawn. The first gentleman who attempted was unsuccessful two times. I can understand this as I myself am a nurse. He apologized and I told him that it was OK. I went to another room when another individual came in the room who was going to attempt to draw the blood herself. I was a little anxious as this would be my third lab draw and she was looking t my veins in the antecubital region. I was hoping she would draw from another place as I had just been poked there. I asked if her if she was going to draw there and she said she was just looking. I remained silent thinking she would alert me when she had found vein and was going to poke me. However, she began preparing her needle and had already swabbed my AC with alcohol. She had palpated the same vein that the previous person had used to draw blood. You could even see the point of entry from the last site. I asked if she could use a different vein. She complied and successfully drew my blood. I was relieved, but was confused when she retracted the needle while only drawing one lab tube. I had been told it would be two tubes. She looks through her orders and realizes she needs another tube. At this point she has to draw my blood again. I was poked 4 times and was frustrated at this point. This lady could have looked at the orders prior to her beginning her blood draw. In fact, this has to be the protocol for every health care professional prior to doing anything regarding the patient.

My second complaint is that I waited roughly 35 minutes in my room after this blood draw for the doctor to come in. I understand that the clinic only had one doctor however the reason I am upset is that this doctor bypassed my position in the que and attended towards another patient. I know this because my room was across the hallway from another patient who came in 10-15 minutes after I had arrived to the room and I heard the nurse who brought the patient into the room tell her that she had two patients before her (one being myself). After 35 minutes of waiting, I opened my door and saw the doctor in the other room. Coincidentally enough the doctor then comes to my room, conducts a 5 minute physical and lets me go. I understand there are priorities and that patients can be seen out of order. Apparently this patient had a cut which needed stitches. Yet, if my physical was only going to take 5 minutes why not just take care of me first, OR let me know so that I wouldn't be left wondering why I am being seen after someone who came in after me.

For the above reasons, I am disappointed with the quality of care provided at this Concentra. And as a health care professional myself, I know that this level of care including professionalism, courtesy, and communication are under par. The detriment is to the patient.<//review>< user_id>

Went in for an employment drug screen. The place is very clean, temperature checks and social distance is well in place. I didn't have a printout of my requisition form so the girl at the front desk let me e-mail it over to her work e-mail. Had to wait a bit, but thats completely normal.  Especially with drug screens. Once in the back they had me store my stuff in a locker and wash my hands. Once again very clean and orderly. Overall a great experience.   Once taken back it took maybe 3 mins. Had me sign and double check my information.<//text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>I went in for physical exam for work. The whole process took 3 hours to complete which is nonsense. The whole testing and what not should have been completed within 30 minutes if they were organized. Dr is good that's the 1 star is for. The nurse that was in charge for my testing didnt show a proper hygiene. Especially in time of covid how could he not use glove while handling urine??? I was horrified. Wasted my whole morning and missed taking my child to school on her first day back. And took 3 nurses and 4 failed attempts to draw bloods. Wasted another week just to schedule to get it done somewhere else.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>Was there last Friday getting a full physical and labs. I have to say, Tech Fernando H. was awesome. He attended me all the way through and was nice, prompt, and personable. I can tell he is very intelligent and he is even gentle with the vaccines, TB test, and blood draw I had to get all in same visit!

Dr. is also very nice as well as receptionist. Overall, had a great experience. Thank you Fernando for being so nice and gentle with vaccines, etc!<//Text>< username>

My first time here and we're very friendly and attentive. Clean waiting area and the restroom too. The have water and snacks for us as we wait to be seen. Also a nice big TV and a movie. Save the Dr and he gave me a crotizon shot on each of knees. It hurt just a little. Since I am very scared of needles. I am still waiting for the crotizon affect to start working on my knees. Some people say it takes a few days or week till it starts working. But over all, it is a very nice place and the workers there, very kind and helpful. I don't know about the physical therapy, since I was not there for that.<//text>

<resp>None</resp><Review>I fainted in the workplace and I was sent here. The doctor that saw me took my vitals and that was it. He was extremely uncomfortable that I had driven myself to Concentra, probably because of liability issues?

He was unprofessional and immature, cartoonish in his reactions about my fainting.

Anyways he refused to let me drive even though my vitals were completely normal and didn't give me a note that said I would be okay to work the next day.

He had me call multiple people in his office to take me to the ER instead of giving me a note himself. I was frustrated that he wasn't confident enough to give it to me himself and was adamant that someone drive me to the ER. I spent 6 hours in the ER for the doctor there to say I was completely fine. Not only was it a waste of time for me- but it was a waste of time for the doctors and nurses at the ER. If I had the choice I would never go to Concentra for a work place injury.</Review></record>

I wasn’t moved to a room until 5:05PM and Dr Rahman spent a total of 4 minutes with me in the room. Dr Rahman wasn’t either prepared and familiar with my referral. The Doctor hadn’t even reviewed my MRI file prior to my examination. Dr Rahman looked at my knee and said “it looks swollen” and said I need to start physical therapy. No standard ligament/joint examination was conducted. Dr Rahman spent approximately 3 minutes in his office reviewing the MRI CD I brought before he returned it.

I did hear the Doctor comment to the nurse as he walked by in the hall; “I’m trying to get out of here.”

I felt completely disappointed by the care at this location and facility.</Review>< resp>

Going to Concentra was a great experience. I drove from Long Beach to their Placentia location for employment screening. The process was fast and easy, I came back for the results and all the paperwork was already faxed to my new employer. Great service, great clinic.<//Review>

I was called in right away which was good but then waited in the room for the PA for about 40minutes and when he came in he was done under 2 minutes! I even asked him if that was it!! If he didn't want to check my eye or ask anything else. I was so shocked to just have him come in shine a light on my eye and say "ok I'll see you in a week, you should be fine" a minute and a half!!! I explained to the PE of the liquid that got I to my eye and showed him a picture of the machine that the solution came from and what the machine is used for. That was my biggest concern. It was the worst office visit experience I've had.  There are more negative details that I experience but will rather speak to a supervisor about it. And to top it off, the information of my visit is so wrong!!!   Unbelievable!!!!</Review>< Pics>

It was Veteran’s Day so I called ahead to check in if they’re open cause I had a stomach ache and was told yes so after I asked if I need Cal-Optima and the person on the phone told me no I don’t need it so I took an Uber to this location and when I went inside they asked me for my Cal-Optima I was like ok I lucky I had it just in case and when I give it to them they told me they don’t accept the one I have so the person at the front desk told me to go some other location I can’t remember well the location she told me but something down State College in a nicely way and she apologize for the convenience. Thats my experience not trying to say they’re all bad in overall.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Review>First and foremost, I would like to thank the staff at Cocentra for taking care of me with my employment screening process.  The staff here was so nice and sincere when I came in for their services.  I'm usually a little hesitant if these types of places because of how rude the staff can be but Concentra caught me off guard with their great customer service and genuine personality.  My service was prompt and pleasant with no complaints.  I would highly suggest this place to anyone who needs to go in for employment screening.  Make sure to ask for Alexis as she was wonderful and genuine.  "THANK YOU" Concentra!!!<//Review>< Pics>

Make an appointment or your walk -in time is likely 3 hrs for a pre-placement physical. My paperwork said walk-ins only.  Not true or a knock on this location.  Staff was courteous and facility was fine, but restroom was being serviced and slowed drug screening process.  Luckily I don't need to use places like this very often.< /Review>

The receptionist was very nice when i first walked in and had a smile on her face. The nurse who game me the TB shot was really funny. There was complimentary coffee in the waiting area which always makes me happy. There was barely any wait what so ever. The doctor who read the TB Test was very nice and humerous. The whole expereince was quick, pleasant, and painless!<//text>

I have received excellent personal care at a time when I was at my most vulnerable and helpless.  My physical therapist, Ryan White is an Angel.  He reassured me that eventually healing was possible, especially if I continued the therapy regiments was learning.  I had four surgeries on both my hands and elbows.  With his assist, I am now ready to go back to work!< /text>

I hate this place! I dislocated my knee cap at work a few days ago... they moved me to about 3 different rooms while I was there cause they were busy and disorganized and was there for almost 3 hours just waiting and in pain. Got sent home with mild anti inflammatory meds and 4 pills of a muscle relaxer to last me till my next appointment which was 5 days later... had a recheck today told the dr the meds they gave me did nothing to ease the pain or swelling then the dr told me I might have possibly torn a ligament since my swelling was still really bad, then I got sent home with no additional meds... I asked the receptionist if I was gonna get more medication since I already ran out she asked the dr and he said I was fine and good to go... how r u gonna tell me I might have a worse off injury than what I originally went in with and not feel it’s necessary to prescribe at least some more anti inflammatory meds (which do nothing for my pain) after seeing my knee is still roughly the size of a soft ball!! Then when I call back later to ask what I’m supposed to do for the pain since they didn’t give me anything they tell me to go back in and pick up more meds, I can’t have anyone pick up the medicine on my behalf I have to personally go all the way back to Anaheim from chino hills to pick up meds I should’ve been given when I was there earlier this morning!!!< /review>

I went for my return to work exam after being off work on disability for 10 weeks. I went on a Monday to the Placentia location. I was told they never received paperwork from my job so I couldn't get the exam. However, my HR person showed me proof that she had faxed it to Concentra the Thursday before. Then when I went back on Wed, I had to wait 90 min before I was seen. People that signed in after me were seen before me. When I asked why that happened, nobody knew why. The HR manager at my job said they have had problems with Concentra saying they haven't received paperwork other times. I think my job should stop using this company for the return to work exams. They seem very disorganized!< /Review>

<text>I waited an hour and a half and I wasn’t seen. I was told it would take an hour and a half total including exam. I complained and was told I could come back another day. I said no I didn’t want to wait another hour and a half. So they rushed me through which was awesome because I had to get my kids from school. The lead nurse there was extremely fast and good at her job I was through the exam part in 15 min. (Physical and random drug test) so total time was 1:45 min.  I think I would of been there 2 hours if I didn’t complain. If the wait time wasn’t so long I would of given a better rating the staff was friendly.<//text><UserId.>111973789275888941548</UserId.><Response>None<//Response><Rate>2</Rate></record>

Showed up around 8:40a and didn't leave til about 11:15am; it sucks that a lot of employers use this clinic for physical exams. Although the physical exam itself only takes about 7 mins, the wait isn't worth It.   Avoid this clinic if you can!</review>< Pictures>

<Text>The only reason why I come here is because this is the only location my acupuncturist comes too. Dr. Robin is great at what she does. She's been doing it for 20 some odd years. My primary issue is with the front desk people. They literally are the worst. The first time I came here it took them 45 minutes to check me out, and my 2nd visit it took an hour to check me in. Their front desk "nurses" all need to be retrained on their guest interactions and their job since they constantly don't know how to tell a patient what's going on, and are continuously mix up files, or they need to be replaced with a crew that is sufficient in these basic qualifications of a front desk personal.<//Text><user>108514330695519521273<//user>< user_name>

They don't seem to know what they are doing as I had a hard time checking in and out where they took an hour to check me out. They just had me sitting in the lobby for an hour after my 5 minute doctor visit until I finally went up to the receptionist Alexis to see what was taking so long and she says I need a follow up appointment before I could check out. I've never heard of a follow up appointment for a tetanus shot. Anyways, the only reason I came here was because my job told me to come for a work related injury but thank God I'll never have to go back there, will just "follow up" with my regular, competant doctor. Would give 0 stars if I could!</text>< Response>

Staff is great and love them all.  But only downfall is their wait time, even if you have an appointment, sometimes waiting 5-50 mins depending on their waiting room if it is full.</Review>

< Review>
This place is not an urgent care facility.  They are a facility most likely for physical therapy related to workman's comp.  I went there at lunch with a pain, and was told $180 just to talk to the doctor, because did not have insurance. I also was advised to go to St.Jude's since they are a REAL urgent care facility, but I was on a bike and in pain and its miles away.  I consented to pay the exorbitant fee, but then was given tons of paperwork with more financial detail than medical history. I realized that this doctor most likely did not give a damn about their Hippocratic oath and only cared about money. I saw the waiting room swelling and I feared a long wait and more charges after a short palaver with a doctor that did nothing for my condition.  I tried to tell staff how I felt but the waiting at the desk was just too long so I just left.  If I drop dead in the next day or two, i guess you should follow up with this facility.< /Review>

<text>Went in at 8am 1st patient in for a DOT physical came out at 11 a.m. Set in an  room for an hour with nobody coming in to tell me why it was taking so long until one of the doctors came in to get supplies and that's when they told me after an hour !

It took last time at the DMV to turn in the paperwork then it did to do the physical  ? and that's waiting without an appointment at the DMV a walk in !</text><user>109138473299751390565</user>< Rating>

They are so inefficient! Long waits and no follow through. I called three times to get results for some blood. Each time they said Dr. Wang will call you back. He never did! They are always running around in the back and so hard to get someone to talk to you. Only one dr in the whole facility. If I had a choice I would use another facility for my workman’s comp issues</review>

My treatment was great, each step was walked through with care and what to be expected. Definitely will be back for continued treatment.

I really like our chiropractor, his name is Dr Marks. In my opinion I prefer his services better than the twin owners. I always go to the Costa Mesa location. Dr Marks makes this location better than Garden Grove. My kids love their electric massage tables as well, they never want to leave the place whenever they lie on them machines.</review>< user_name>

Aside from the great chiropractors, the front desk makes you feel at home. i would highly recommend this place to anyone, you will not regret it.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I cannot say enough great things about Twins Chiropractic that would really tell you just how great these guys are, you just have to see it for yourself. The friendly staff really makes you feel welcome and treat you as family, they are very attentive and caring. The variety of services they provide, being very detailed in their treatment plan and overall guidence has helped me improve my health greatly and eased my discomfort due to aches and pains tremendously! This is the only chiropractor I would recommend in a heartbeat and with full confidence to my family, friends and anyone seeking a fantastic chiropractor. Thank you Twins Chiropractic for always meeting my needs and expectations, keep up the fantastic work!<//Text>

<text>Such a sweet and patient staff. Get your X-ray so you can see exactly what’s going on with your spine. Rolling tables at the end of your adjustment are a plus. So relaxing. Massages available too.<//text>< Pics>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Review>Quality chiropractic care is given here. All doctors and other personnel are very kind and love what they do.

I have not been here in well over a year because of price discrepancies (I am a cash patient). When I originally called here, they told me adjustments would be $30. After the "complimentary" x-ray, they increased the price to $50. For some people this might not be a lot, but for me that is quite a bit of money. On top if this, they continued to call and pester me telling me I'm "overdue" for a visit lol. Wow. I also had to call twice to get them to remove my number from their system so they would stop contacting me.

I know there has to be a hell of a lot more cash patients and they need to know this info! Zero interest in getting a call from y'all to "fix" this so don't bother. Thanks!</Review>< user_name>

I reached this clinic to find a solution to my lower back pain. The outcome after their treatment is beyond AMAZING! The team here works in synergy to simply make you feel renovated. All they care about is getting you back on track into a pain-free wellness.

Integrated treatment is perfect here;

1. Starts by a warm welcome with Madison at the records / front desk.
2. The chiro-practice by Dr. Michael Marks is wisdom and power on his hands. Makes your body/mind allign right away. Add to it the best follow-up advice on stretches for your condition.
3. If you require a core solution to pain N.P. Jessica Kim has the right solution with trigger point injections. When they guided me into this procedure my symptoms decreased and I was able to do movements that my muscles were holding before. After the detailed examination she runs on you, there is no doubt you are in good hands! Top clinical acumen.
4. Then comes maintaining your good results, and here CNA Jennifer is a top player, she's so detailed on keeping your treatment on the spot. I get vitamin B-12 shots via intramuscular and her care is outstanding. If you fear needles; she'll make you forget the pinch. Best injection technique.

Overall the names I mention here make my weekly journey feel like visiting family. THANK YOU SO MUCH, love you all!<//text>

Great place. Young and fresh as a chiropractor place can be. Feels like they are all about great health in all facets, not just chiropractic work.<//Review>

I've seen many chiropractors through my lifetime and here at Twin's I've seen 2 chiropractors and both of them have been very good.... I mainly go because of Beverly, the best massage therapist...</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Twins Chiropractic & Physical Medicine is my go to Chiropractor & Massage Therapy. I go here 2 times a month, and get a massage before my Chiropractor visit. Dr. Marks is patient and kind very helpful in putting me back into alignment. His treatment therapy works very well, and I can tell the progress I have made is due to my time spent here in this office, and the techniques I've learned from Dr. Michael Marks.

Barbara is my masseuse, and she is delightful. She works in the Shiatsu Massage techniques with others to get the knots out and give me a great rejuvenation on the stress that plagues my week. Twins Chiro is my pitstop for living a less stressful, more aligned life. I highly recommend it; and them.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Unfortunately the day I came in I was the ONLY person wearing a mask in this establishment. Everyone stared at me as I waited in line and I stood there for 10 minutes until I left. The barista helped other people behind me and ignored the fact that I was there. I don't know why people are trying to pretend this virus doesn't exist. You will not catch me stepping a foot in here again.< /Review></record>

Best coffee shop in Yreka!  The coffee is delicious!  The baked goods are amazing and made fresh in house!  They have an excellent selection of teas as well.  The owners are delightful!  They have a nice offering  of new and used books and can also order any they don't have with arrival in a very timely fashion.  We love their charming and unique handmade stuffed animals too!  They have hedgehogs,  elephants, cats, owls etc. and they are too cute for words!  We love hanging out at Zephyr, it's a cozy little place to come and sit for a while!< /Review>

<Text>This was my fourth visit and I have to say I really enjoy this place. The gentleman who made my delicious lavender latte even helped me to my seat because I had my daughter in my arms. The marion berry scone was sooooo good. I have purchased a few books there as well.

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>First time I shop here and had a pleasant experience.  The store was nice , clean & was easy to find what I needed for my granddaughter.  I price of the clothing  were so reasonable.   The promotions they had were awesome on jeans.  Almost everything in the store was 50 % off, which was great.  I will definitely be coming back here to shop.</text>< Pictures>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>I tried to return a Gap Factory on-line order at the store.  After the clerk fussed around looking for the order for ten minutes, using my email, two different phone numbers, my credit card, my order number, she told me that she could give me store credit or I would have to return to the store a different day because they were unable to process my return that night.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>You can't make Gap returns at the Gap Factory store if your items are from Gap. I purchased an item from Gap online and tried to return it here but I guess because it's a "Factory" store and they didn't carry the item I ordered, I could not return it.< /Text>< Date>

I've had a storage here for some years now. Used it to store furniture. After checking on my stuff last week I noticed rat poop everywhere. On all my furniture. I'm done here. Furniture is now no good. I also heard a rat running around in the storage next to mine.</text>

They didn't inform me about the past due. Or when I needed to pay. I have never been at a storage unit that we don't pay when I get it. I have had storage units where I pay the day I go in. I have never heard of a unit charging me on the first when I came in on the 9th. That's 8 days that I was ripped off. Worst place, dont come. Also how about giving a courtesy call. When your unit is about to be paid.< /text>

I rent alot of different storage units out and this is by far the worst one ive delt with do to the fact that it doesnt matter what day you start renting they make you pay on the first on the month. I started renting on the 8th i expect to have to pay on the 8th since im paying a full month of service. Every other strong unit i have renting makes me pay the day i get the unit doesnt matter if i entered on the 9th or the 28th im paying for a month not half a month not 3weeks. I want to make this review for future guest to know if you want to rent a month and its the middle of the month of lets say june go somewhere else since they'll make you pay the whole month for just 2 weeks of service. This is sad and i feel robbed honestly never experienced this with any other storage unit. I have one in medera California one in Albuquerque new Mexico one in Indianapolis Indiana and none of them have done this. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!<//Review>

Thee most difficult storage properties to have, if you cant always pay on time. The FEES are ridiculous! $140 in just Lien fees.

<text>Service was fast, but pleasant. Eating area decent and the food had a good amount of flavor.  I thought the price was a tad high $15 for the small with a drink, but worth it for fast, good tasting food and a good size portion.</text>< pictures>

<text>I took my best friend to eat poke at this place. And we both  loved it. It was fresh and delicious. As my friend had never eaten poke she was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food. Loved the whole open concept of the building where the bar is located. And also super happy to see how well cleaners are recycling. People who go here should be more attentive how they put their trash in the can. Place has reasonable prices for the amount of poke you get. Thank you< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQzKe6M72z2Ud9gqdJQEfUgj_xm2KiJ8YvqHQi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<username>Shannen Bond< /username><time>1575993954646</time><rating>5<//rating><Text>My favorite poke bowl in the whole Bay Area by far. The price is reasonable. They have lots of options for meat or toppings, but the highlight of the Poke bar is the kale noodles that they have as an option for the base. They're super good, and works perfectly if you want something lighter than rice, but you're not in the mood for crunchy veggies.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>I've been here a couple of times from the first week they've opened to the present. I'm happy that the quality and flavor has gone up.

I usually get rice with two scoops of salmon, ponzu sauce, and a bunch of the toppings. Mango and avocado are a $1 extra, unsurprisingly. Because my office isn't far, I would just buy an avocado from The Market and slice it myself.

You can build your own bowl, or you can order one of their pre-made ones. The line gets pretty long during the lunch hour, and it can seem hectic putting in your order. And if you're short like me, it can be hard to hear and speak to the employees as the sneeze guard is very tall.  But the line does go fast.

If your base is mixed greens, ask for more of the sauce. The greens are not dressed, so all the moisture will be coming from the fish.

Unfortunately, the last time I ate here, there was a piece of plastic in my poke bowl.  I was really hungry, and luckily I wasn't inhaling my food because I would've swallowed it, and it was really sharp.  I thought it might've been a fish bone, but after further inspection, it definitely was plastic.  I didn't want to walk back there from my office, so I e-mailed corporate, but I never got a response.

I really like the poke here, but I don't want to risk eating a sharp piece of plastic.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOo5S9ZdAB2H4VabY-1r-xlNQjfjowfJfLp4pje=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I contacted them about this but never heard back. Also, it was very hard to find a way to contact them via their website, which is probably by design. Generally good food, but won't be back due to the lack of responsiveness/poor customer service (and sometimes-rancid cucumbers).<//Review>< GmapID>

<Text>I am a regular to this poke bar. But that is going to change now. I loved the food very much until recently. They have new people there who seem to care less when making the poke. I notice they wear gloves but touch everything with the gloves - counter top, shelves, packages, even their dirty aprons and hair. Then with the same gloves they start preparing the food. Then they use their dirty gloves to pick out and touch the mixing glove. These elderly woman even rubbed the mixing glove between her two dirty glove covered hands to open it. Then she slid the mixing glove on top of her dirty gloved hand. It seems they are trying to protect their hands rather than the food. So gross. I was served by this one woman - elderly lady. Her long breaded hair was laying over her shoulder and in front of her chest. The end of it was almost touching the counter. So gross. I got my bowl and left. When I took my first scoop out, there was a long black hair. Oh gosh so gross! There went my $17+ right in the trash can. This place was nice and clean, but now over the last two months new people are ruining it. I hope the management train these new workers hygiene and proper handling of food.  I hate when a good food place go bad because of how they serve or prepare the food.</Text>< Pics>

This is a good takeout place for sushi bowls. My bowl was well filled and there was a wide variety of ingredients to pick from. The overall quality was good, although the fish tasted kind of cheap.<//Review>

Poke bowls done right! Really fresh salmon to this bowl but I'm a little concerned about the amount of waste there is- there's a separate cardboard container where they mix all the Ingredients before tossing it into the bin. Seems overly wasteful to me but good place for a quick bite overall<//Text>

<review>Great addition to the neighborhood.  You get to pick your base (brown/ white rice or salad), your fish (tuna, salmon, others I can't remember), your toppings (more stuff I don't remember, but there are lots), everyone gets seaweed salad and crab.  Then they mix it all up for you with whatever sauce you choose.  It's a lot of food, you get to create it yourself, and it's not too expensive.  The only down side is there tends to be a line most days.< /review>< pictures>

Great poké and huge portions.  I was really hungry and the medium (3 scoops) was more than I could finish. The line moves really fast. It was slammed at noon but much more manageable at 1pm.</review>

A very average poke bar. Their dressings are all heavily over salted and the tuna didn’t taste too fresh.<//Text>

<rating>2</rating><Text>Hint: this place is inside the market next to Twitter. It took me a while to find it as I was looking for a storefront. It has a chipotle concept where you choose a base, proteins, mix-ins, then flavors and toppings. I got the small (2 scoops) of white rice, spicy tuna, salmon and scallop, some random toppings with their house dressing. I thought it was okay. The fish/seafood wasn’t fresh so that threw off the whole dish. I hate when a place is known for something and they don’t do it that well. The flavors and the toppings are good though, but what I actually came for (the poke) was meh. Also, I don’t eat as much as I use to, but the small is too small. I was still hungry after.

Overall, the concept and the overall dish was pretty good, but the poke was not.</Text>< Pictures>

The customer service from the people that work behind the counter is atrocious. I suggest if you go there DO NOT make any changes to prefixed menu. Want salmon instead of tuna for the Firecracker? That will literally cause chaos for them. Also, they need to go work at subway and learn how to run a line. Don't want your tuna/salmon mixed in with the rice right away (don't want it to be soggy if take out), then too bad, because your food goes down the line so fast and away from you, you can't tell them any changes you want. They aren't going fast and efficient, it's just frantic.< /Text>

Experienced extremely poor service with Peter, the operations managet at this poke bar. I got a poke bowl and sat down with my friend. Peter asked us to leave because my friend did not get anything from poke bar. I would suggest that visitors do NOT use this place.</text>

(Translated by Google) Fantastic Food! Fresh, full of flavor and a reasonable size of portions is something worth waiting in line for. A mix of flavors that makes lunch extraordinary! I was really charmed and will definitely look back there whenever I'm in the area. I recommend, recommend and recommend again :)

<Review>I went to the store to look for an offer that my wife said it was online the price was free
W/Elig.port to un'ltd+tax/Act fee
Needless to say that I was wrong
But the attitude from the sales girl was so poor yes my close was dirty but after been working all day having to head out and still it doesn't matter if you don't want to be there look for other job.

<rating>1< /rating><Review>I wish that I could give this place a ZERO! By far the WORST customer service in Stockton, and its the corporate office! They will discriminate against you if you are black and have an expensive device. They will refuse to exchange the device even if you have a warranty and insurance and will lie right to your face and make up a reason why they cant exchange your device. When you ask to speak to a manager they don't help they side with the employee and say there's nothing they can do. It seems like they go out of their way to make your experience as difficult as possible instead of making sure the customer leaves satisfied. If you want to be treated with respect and good customer service DO NOT come here.< /Review>< Pictures>

I recently went into the store and was helped out by a girl i dont rememeber her name but her employee id number is P12637228 and she added name ID & call detail to both my lines without my consent & then lied to me & said my bill was gonna be 90 when in reality its 96 she then also tried to say she gave me a free sim. But that is a promo that is already offerred by metro when u switch and bring in your own phones lol What she didnt know was that i am ex corporate metro employee. I called her out infront of other staff and i was even correct on what features she added. That employee is playing people out of their money. All of them might be slamming customers so if you are going in their to get phones check all your recipts check your my metro account to check your bill and make sure the amount your suppose to pay is accurate. Stop slamming customers and learn how to be a true mobile expert🤡🤡🤡<//review>

< review>
This Metro PCS store is one of the better ones. The employees are very friendly and courteous and as well as very very knowledgeable about their products and they know what is wrong with your phone and how to fix it when you bring it in for problem.
But if they aren't able to fix it they can send it in to be repaired but you would also have to pay a fee for that, especially if you don't have insurance for the phone and I suggest getting insurance for your cell phone because that is the best decision and add-on that you can get for your phone as they can replace it with a new one of the same type and if they don't have the same phone they give you a new one just as good if not better.
You can pay your bill outside on an ATM like machine when they are closed at any time of the day or night.
The only downfall is they can be out of stock on a lot of the better phones. So unless you don't mind waiting, then you can wait until a new stock/shipment comes in with that phone or they can/will order you one.
That store is considered a MetroPCS corporate store so they are able to do much more than just pay your bill and set up a new line.
I like going to this MetroPCS store than any of the other ones. I only go to the other Metro Stores if there's a phone I really really want and it's not in stock at this one. So really, why go to other Metro PCS stores? Unless it's just to pay a bill and it's close to your house, then I can understand why.
Oh, and they do tend to get pretty busy at times which results in a wait time, but that should show that they are good and know what they are doing and worth the wait.<//review>

<Review>My K7 just stopped working so I went on the Metro website to purchase a new phone. Unfortunately, the K20 is not available online so I had to go to one of these horrible customer service places.

I reluctantly went to this store on 09/15/17. The guard at the door was nice and friendly but he is not a MetroPCS employee. Once in the store, the atmosphere was heavy. The employees were all on their phones and there were no customers. I was told by a black guy named Khalil that their "system" was down. It was 30 minutes before closing time. They were playing some ghetto music with a lot of explicit language and bad words.

I went back on 09/17/17 and Khalil was there again and guess what he said? He said their "system" was down again. Man, they need an IT dude there. I don't believe anything was wrong with their computers though. It was 20 minutes before closing and I know that the employees didn't want to work anymore. There were (4) four employees just chilling on their phones. Again. This place is horrible. No one wanted to help and this one girl said it was too late anyway to help.This place is the most terrible place to go to. I would give it zero stars if I could.

I will find another phone online or another cell phone service provider instead.<//Review>< Pics>

I did an LG update on my phone, and it completely wrecked it. I called customer service, but they were no help at all, so I was already mad when I went to this store. Maricela and Eric were awesome! Even though they weren't able to fix my phone, they replaced it with no complaints, and they were really nice.<//review>

They didn't want to accept my passport card because it didn't have my address was looking to get the iPhone I could have easily gave them my address if they ask for it plus I'm the one paying for the phone anyways it's not like I'm getting it on credit if you ask me I think it's just poor customer service<//review>

Don't go this shop. They do really sloppy job. Alawys make mistakes, and just say sorry. That's it. You still have to pay for nothing due to thier mistake. They don't how to properly use their systems or their system is really sloppy. When ever you ask them to do something, the answer is either they don't know or they can't.<//Text>

I don't like metro pcs. I've had an Android for 3 months and it just stopped sending or receiving calls. Had to go to this store for service.45 min trip almost an hour wait in line. They told me it would need to be replaced. They would text me when the replacement came in. Phone didn't work but text does...I thought...No contact for a month so I finally made the trip to Stockton. Again, long wait in line only to be told they sent the replacement back. They said they texted me and it was my problem. The manager was extremely rude. I looked on my text history And there was no record of a text from them. the manager couldn't have cared less. I'm very eager to go to another company.< /review>

I love Orcutt veterinary Hospital and everyone that works there. Sierra, Jessica, Gabby, Allison, and Dr. Forsyth are the best. They have incredible hearts and compassion and they’ve never let me down. You can trust them wholeheartedly with your fur babies.< /Text>

<text>Dr. Forsythe is an amazing person. I have known her for much of my life. You will not find a more compassionate, knowledgeable,  veterinarian. She graduated from the top Vet school in the country (#2 in the world!!!) and practices state of the art medicine. As well, she is just a very good and nice person. If you are looking for a vet in this area, you really need to check out this hospital.< /text><username>Max Salinas<//username><userid>113731553413521414678< /userid><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrGGpXdavxpl8qBZM0ZXMoxz_d_NQPYgNJoGdU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Had a a slight issue with my dogs nail after a trimming here that may have been caused before the trimming and I hadn’t realized it. They helped me resolve the issue very quickly.<//text>

{'time': 1615765742707, 'text': "What is going on with your dog's toenail is not a normal situation and should be evaluated by a veterinarian.  The chart notes from the front desk and from the technician who did the nail check and trim (who is also a R.N., but not a veterinarian and therefore not able to diagnose or treat) indicate that this was originally scheduled (but original appointment was  not kept) as a “check nail “ a few days earlier than the date we actually saw her, and the notes indicate that a nail was already missing and the nail bed did not look normal.  At your dog's age that could be from many causes ranging from trauma (getting it caught on something), or infection, to cancer (nail bed tumor, etc).  This would not result from a nail trim three days ago, even if a nail was trimmed short - nails don't fall off from a short nail trim.  This is concerning and should definitely be evaluated by a veterinarian you trust and have confidence in.  Our technician also documented that she asked you to let us know if the nail was not continuing to improve, so we aren’t sure why you haven’t called to have us recheck it if you are concerned rather than taking this approach."}<//Resp>

<rating>2</rating><Text>Maybe I was spoiled by previous vets, but customer service isn't what it used to be. Before, when a pet had a procedure done the vet would meet with you in a room before you picked up your animal. Now, or at least at this vet, you pay your bill then a tech brings your dog out to you, hands you the leash and leaves. This is not a COVID thing. This is just how they do it here.
It has always made me feel like it is just a money thing, but I never spoke up. I am speaking up now because when I picked my dog up after a minor procedure they wanted to sell me a bottle of pain meds. I declined the pain meds due to the minor nature of the procedure and the fact my dog is old and on pain meds already.
It wasn't until a couple days later that I thought it strange that they did not send antibiotics home with me. I called and they advised me I declined antibiotics. I was upset, but the girl in the office apologized to me for giving me the wrong info. This was an innocent mistake by a new employee. However, the tech she asked should have realized there was something off about me declining a $20 bottle of antibiotics when I spent $320 on the procedure.
All in all it is the doctors responsibility. The doctor should have met with me after the procedure. The doctor should meet with every client after their dog has a surgery.
No harm done. I am just going back to my old vet. Its a drive, but they are worth it.<//Text><user>114839478064482569263</user><Time>1603568099943< /Time>< pictures>

Everyone at the OVH are really terrific!  I love the way the vet techs, the doctors, and those at the front desk take care of the pets as well as their owners.  The only reason I knocked down one star is because of the long, long wait.  Seems like it takes forever to be seen by the doctor and it's this way each and every time we go in.  I don't understand this.  Otherwise, it's the greatest place to take your little ones!</Text>

We all try very hard to share our love and concern for our patients and their guardians, and we are so pleased to know you feel the love.  We also try hard to stay on time, but wait times are determined by many factors that vary from day to day, such as the complexity of the medical issues other patients may be experiencing and what is going on in the back with surgical and critical medical cases.  I know that on your last visit we were concurrently dealing with an emergency for a dog that could not walk.  We ask our staff to let clients know when and why we are running late, but apparently they did not inform you of what was going on, and we are all sorry that did not get communicated.  We honestly do try to stick to the schedule as best we can as we do respect your time.  Thank you once again for your confidence in us!\n\nCheers,\nOrcutt Veterinary Hospital'}<//response>

I’ve gone to this specific vet hospital for many years. They are the best in there field. The staff is kind, friendly and is able to answer any question I might have when it comes to my fur babies /family.
They do great work in our community as well with the crisis of so many feral cats and kittens. They spend countless hours in helping many volunteers in stabilizing these colonies and making it better for all.
I appreciate all there hard work and efforts in all they do. They are truly the real deal! Well done Team! Well done!!!< /text>

First of all, I must say the visit was great.  Both the vet and the assistant were great with my very scared / injured cat and I left the visit feeling as if they really cared.  However, the woman who made the follow-up call two days later was the worst.  She was short, rude, unhelpful, and just terrible when it comes to customer service.  They need to have someone who knows how to talk to people make follow-up calls, not someone who seems unwilling to help or give more advice or options when a customer is asking for it.<//text>

< Review>
My dog has been seen here for about 3 years. There is a newer, young receptionist named Stephanie who has the absolute WORST customer etiquette I have EVER encountered!! I have been in Customer Service for over 20 years and she is the worst I have ever encountered in all of that time. From day one she has been nothing but awful. She's condescending, rude, cuts you off when you speak, is unhelpful, and is just downright terrible! Every time I call I hope I don't have to interact with her and every single time I do interact with her, it leaves me feeling steaming angry. I waited way too long before writing this  review and I will be bringing it to the management's attention. They are permanently losing our business  due to her incompetence and rude behavior. It's truly a shame because the facility isn't all that bad, and being an Orcutt resident, it's the most convenient place to take our dog. To have such an atrocious young woman as the face and voice of their practice is a travesty. The prices are high and the customer service is awful. Also, we boarded our dog here a few times and every time we came to pick her up her bed was soaked in urine and she now has separation anxiety because of the lack of care. I give this place a two-star rating because the veterinarians are knowledgeable and helpful, other than that don't waste your time or money.<//Review>

{'time': 1558726850608, 'text': "I am truly sorry for your experience.  I asked Stephanie about what happened, and she told me this was a request for proof of vaccination and medical records.  She said she provided you with the vaccination record at the time of  your request and let you know the medical record would be available to you once the doctor, who was in surgery at the time, authorized it (medical records are confidential legal documents and their release cannot be done by staff without approval by management to ensure this confidentiality).  She subsequently put the record on the doctor's desk to be authorized as soon as the doctor is available to do so, as per the required confidentiality policy she is required to follow.\nThere is definitely not a lack of care for our boarding animals - they have turn out and playtime with our animal-loving staff at least twice daily, and their attitude and appetite are carefully monitored and charted.  Some dogs are more stressed than others by being boarded, but I can assure you that your sweet dog is beloved by all of our staff, and everyone here really enjoys spending time with her.\nWe try to discourage personal bedding with our boarding patients because it can be fouled in the boarding runs and often requires daily laundering, whereas we can provide our own comforters which are always available, freshly laundered and changed out regularly.  If a boarding animal urinates shortly before they are discharged, we may not have time to launder their personal bedding before they leave.\nI love seeing your sweet dog and have enjoyed providing care to her over the years, and I know she is definitely a staff favorite.  My office manager, Gaby, will discuss your impressions about your customer service with our front desk staff and will be reaching out to you by phone to address your concerns personally.  I would really miss seeing your sweet Calamity as well as you and your family, so please feel free to give me a call if you would like to talk further with me."}< /Resp>

I have known Dr. Forsyth’s for 20 years and first met her when she cared for my special needs Dachshund Klaus. I was so worried about my beloved dog and was starting to feel hopeless about his complicated medical solution. Dr. Brenda was not only a super hero to me, and showed exceptional compassion and empathy, she also treated my fragile little dog with respect and kindness, demonstrating that she valued him as a living, feeling being. When she got down on the floor to make him feel more comfortable, I knew I had found a very special partner in his care. Dr. Brenda is a rare breed and I would trust her with the care of any of my beloved animal companions.</text>

I have never had a bad experience and always recommend her to anyone that asks! No matter how many questions I may ask or how many times I am always treated kindly. I won’t take my animals anywhere else!

Hello Dr. Brenda.  I know that this is not the appropriate way to communicate with you; however, I really need to do this.  My dogs go to Orcutt Vet:  Roo, Richie, Zeus and Goober.  As you know, Roo has special needs and so does Richie.  I was trying to get a prescription for Roo for Pentoxifilline which has been filled in the past by the dermatologists in LA that come up to Pet ER.  They can not come up any longer so Dr. Flores was handling it.  I asked for it over a week ago and still did not have the prescription (Roo has Vasculitis).  So I called in again.  The person  (I think she is blonde and a little older) called me back and said that Dr. Flores had called it in and she hung up on me.  I called her back and asked if she was upset with me and she informed me that everyone talks out front about what a monster I am that I am hard to deal with.  Except for the day I was stuck in the room for 45 minutes (its tax season) I did not know about it.  Roo loves coming in.  I have brought the girls baked goods and put good words in the box out front.  You have been fantastic Dr. Brenda.  I could not ask for a better vet; however, I can not come back and I am so sorry.  I don't even know where to go to find another vet but I can not come back in where people think I am so bad.  I apologized to her and asked for forgiveness and I apologize to you also. I am so sad and sorry.  Thank you Dr. Brenda for the wonderful care you have given to my puppies.  Cheryl LeRoy< /review>

You and your sweet dogs are part of our family and I feel so bad about this misunderstanding.  I have talked with Gaby from our front desk about what occurred, and she definitely did not intend to convey what you have perceived.  I can assure you that our team never discusses anything, medical or otherwise,  regarding our clients or patients in front of anyone who is not staff or in any public part of the hospital, or outside of the hospital - we honor the confidentiality of our clients and patients.  I know you are in the busiest time of year for your business, but I think a face-to-face discussion would best clear the air.  If you could make a small amount of time for us to come pay you a visit to talk it over and put things right, we would gladly come to you.  I sincerely apologize that such a breakdown in communication would have occurred and really hope to help you realize that we truly do value you and care about you and your companions.  Again, I am so sincerely, truly sorry, and honestly hope to have a chance to make it right.  We will reach out to you next week in the hope of arranging to get together.  Most sincerely, Dr. Brenda. (6/9/20 update:  thank you Cheryl for giving us all the opportunity to put things right again.  We value you and enjoy seeing and serving all of your sweet companions.

They know my pet by name and she likes the staff and even recognizes them outside the office. I am in their debt.

<text>There are people who just love animals in general and will do whatever they can to help them. Dr. Brenda Forsythe is that kind of person, and she fills her practice with those who are like-minded.

Some of the negative reviews on here are just pure hogwash/spam.  Others who complain clearly have very unrealistic expectations of what a vet practice that cares looks like. Same day appointments are not easy to come by in a good practice, but those that care will try to work you in as soon as possible, as Orcutt Veterinary Hospital did.

The way that they care enough to address their clients comments and concerns on here should make it obvious to anyone with a fuzzy family member that this practice will treat their loved ones as such.<//text></record>

Dr. Forsythe has been amazing with my 16 year old baby who is dealing with Stage 3 kidney failure and my other 11 year old baby who has megaesophagus and related complications. She was patient, explained everything, and was so great about answering every question I had. She even invited us into the back to see X-rays and explained them to us in detail!

Dr Forsythe and her staff have been there for all of my furry family through all of the highs and lows of being a pet owner.
Their genuine compassion and professionalism I feel whenever I’m there makes me feel like a family member and not a client.
They provide great medicine at affordable prices which is always a plus.</text>

< Review>
My wife encountered really unfriendly office staff and won't go back. So often great vets and doctors are diminished by unprofessional office staff and this was the case during her visit.  I hope they have a chat with the staff.  Also, why keep a dog in the office that is known unfriendly?  Just seems like unnecessary liability.<//Review>

Absolutely wonderful experience! Dr. Forsythe preformed a Miracle on our 2 year old Arabian gelding. He had gotten a pretty nasty gash on his shoulder which was stitched up ounce by a different vet but the sutures had dehisced so we called Brenda to see what she should do & I was blown away at the precision at which she re-sutured the wound. The sutures held all the way till the end & the wound is now healing beautifully with hopefully minimal scaring. Thank you again Brenda!<//text>

We asked if it was an emergency because we were in surgical procedures with patients in the back of the hospital at that time of day, which is why the waiting room was empty and the doctor was unavailable for an immediate appointment.  Our schedule was full and the soonest we could see the dog was at the end of the day, and we gave you that slot for just 3 hours after you walked in .  It was not an appointment slot we normally have in the schedule but we created it purposely so we could help you out with the dog you found.

Unfortunately we did not have a doctor on premises when you showed up yesterday requesting immediate assistance, so our staff did all we could to help by confirming your appointment, pulling your chart from storage (last visit was 11 years ago so it had been archived) , and suggesting places you could try if you needed more immediate assistance.  We work by appointment and the law requires that we must have a doctor on premises to carry out any veterinary procedures.  We are truly sorry we were not able to be of immediate  assistance to you, but hope you understand that we do care and wanted to help.  Again, our hearts go out to you and your family.  Most sincerely, Orcutt Veterinary Hospital'}< /response>

From the moment of walking into the office, Ms. Cynthia,the young lady who helped my girlfriend and I, was very courtesy and professional. When we asked about the availability and sizes of their storage units, she immediately asked what sizes, and what amount of space we will need. After giving her our specifics on what we were going to store, she took us to view 2 of their bigger units so we can get a clear view of what we can choose from.

She was explicit about the rules and regulations of using the lift, and storage units. Which I felt was the most important aspect of the facility.  We selected the best unit for our needs, and the service was outstanding. Although, I only have one suggestion. When asked if there were any discounts offered, she asked if I was active duty military, and when I replied that I am a US Navy Veteran,  she apologized and stated that the discounts were for active duty military.  This in my opinion should also be a discount for veterans as well. Especially if they travel and would need a storage as well because I am a federal employee who travels quite a bit.

Other than that. I think that the  San Marcos Mini Storage company is a great place to get a storage unit when needed for any size storage unit you need. Great job and Thank you again Ms. Cynthia for outstanding service...</text>

Really love this place. Cynthia and David were wonderful. They showed me the property and made sure I was 100% satisfied before getting the storage unit. They showed me it again before finalizing everything. They also let me know about the potential savings and discounts that I could get to save me some money. Would highly recommend.<//Review>

Cynthia and Dave we're both very helpful and informative through the whole process of selecting my storage unit. Cynthia specifically showed me what was available and was also very accommodating. This is by far the best facility I've been to and I will continue to use the facility in the coming years.<//Text>

This storage facility has to be hands down one of the cleanest and most well maintained that I have seen. Cynthia at the front desk is one of the most friendly and helpful person. She made sure the process of moving in was very simple and easy and everything was done quickly. 10/10 would recommend this facility for storage needs!</Review>

I came here for a storage unit and they were very helpful and quick once I arrived. They were also VERY sanitary! They clean their place 4 times a day and all wear masks which is very responsible during these times. The prices for the units are great and storing things using their elevator is very convenient. David and Leslie in particular were great people and helped out alot! I highly recommend anyone in the area to come here for storage.<//text>

< Review>
Was referred to this storage company from a close friend who has one there. I had a tough request for a certain size and a few days later got the call from the manager Dave. They had an opening!!! This place looks super secure, has a clean nice restroom and great hours!!! Can’t say enough about Dave and the service!!!</Review>

The staff at San Marcos Mini Storage are super friendly and easy going. They provide you with all the information that you need in order for a smooth check in. It’s great to see businesses like this stay open through COVID, and of course, practice the appropriate precautions- hand sanitizing, face masks, social distancing. They definitely made me feel safe and I would 100% recommend their business if ever you’re looking for storages pace!< /text>

Wow !! What a great leasing experience. Cynthia’s positive attitude and tone over the phone got me in here and it was just as welcoming inside the office with her and David. The help was amazing but more importantly during such a gloomy time they were overly nice to everyone.< /Review>

San Marcos mini storage goes above and beyond for their customers. Dave the resident manager was of great help from the minute I inquired. Latoya was extremely nice and accommodating, as I arrived 1 hour early before they opened she was willing to go through with the signing process and finished with a breeze. Great people.< /text>

Dave was super helpful at getting me set up with a unit that would suite my needs and was a fair price. I love that insurance is included and that they made sure my weather strip was resealed before I started moving things in. The attention to details like that are appreciated.</review>

< Review>
The facility is easily accessible, clean and the customer service excellent!  La Toya is helpful, courteous and goes out of the way to ensure that the moving experience goes smoothly. She always greets you with a big smile, answers any questions  and helps ease the stress of moving. I would highly recommend San Marcos Mini storage for storage needs!</Review>

I was down the street at a different location that looked less than ideal. I called and David was available for us to come right in and look at units. The price is fair and there service is exceptional. I highly recommend this location.<//review>

After working with several different storage facilities in north county San Diego I wanted to share the great experience I had at San Marcos Mini Storage. Dave & Latoya are both so awesome to work with and they are extremely attentive to all your needs. I would highly recommend this facilities for a safe & secure storage facility with the best attitude and Latoyas smile 😊<//review>

My name is Marcy not sure why my name won't show up. But I needed 10 file boxes I had called other businesses prior but David Haller at San Marcos mini storage gave me a deal and was so exceptional I went to get my boxes from them. I would highly recommend San Marco's mini storage for all your needs.< /text>

Have been shopping around for storage for weeks. Happened to come across this storage units one day. Walked in and talked to Manager David Haller. He is awesome. Told him we would be utilizing the storage for business for our discount furniture shop. And moving service. We were offered Discount because of being a business. The property is clean and secure access times are just what we needed and so close to home and business. Looking forward to having a long business relationship. With David and his team.</Review>

<text>This place is great! Not only is it clean and safe, but we received the best customer service ever. Alicia and Jose are THE BEST! From the initial phone call inquiry to actually going in and selecting our unit, they were friendly, professional, and extremely helpful. They helped us get the best deal for our units and we loved being able to use the moving van, for FREE! I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for something affordable and safe with great customer service.<//text>< rating>

I'm moving from another facility, where my unit was broken into, to San Marcos Mini Storage.
This storage facility is clean, well maintained, well lite, very secure.and professionally run by David Haller. The unit I'm renting is clean.
I would recomend using them for your storage needs.<//Review>

Came in during my lunch to check out a storage unit and Toya and Paul were both amazing team members! Drove me over to the lot and showed me around, I was sold with how professional and friendly they were! The area is clean and I feel safe keeping my belongings there!! Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a storage unit in San Diego County!</review>

I came in on the weekend.  The gal in charge was helping another couple with their rental. She sounded professional, thorough, very helpful and knowledgeable.  As I listened, I noticed she was not 'pushy' or trying to sway the couple in any way.  When it was my turn, the gal helped me make my decision on the size of unit I needed by taking me to the available units.  I have rented other units in other venues in the past, but I felt at ease with her.  Again, she was not pushy and understood my plight [still had a month to go on another unit in another county.]. She reserved my choice [the last one in that size] and I was able to rent it a few days later.  Her customer service was OUTSTANDING and it was a pleasure to have someone work with me without any type of pressure.
As for the premises, it looks new, is very clean and has all the available amenities a storage facility should have.<//Text>

I'll start this review by saying this facility has amazing customer service! There was a change of plans with our moving situation and needed last-minute movers with a truck. We stopped by the facility and David Haller and LaToya Emanuel went above and beyond by helping us find a solution to our problem. They willingly called as many people as they could think of that could help. My family and I were incredibly impressed with their service. David and LaToya were determined to help us - that itself says a lot of who they are individually as well. I have encountered different storage facilities with subpar service but never experienced a facility with such incredible staff. David and LaToya are so warm, friendly, kind and helpful. They made us feel comfortable and put our minds at ease.

I highly recommend this facility as you will be treated with such respect. David and LaToya deserve all the wonderful recognition because they make San Marcos Mini Storage stand out from the rest.</review>

< review>
I'm moving from one house to a small house. I have a lot of extra stuff that I need to store. I picked this place because it was close to my house that I'm moving to. Let me first of all say I showed up with red eyes messy hair dog hair covering my wrinkled clothes pretty much a bum. It's been a long stressful day of packing. Our landlord let us know that our rent was going to go up by $600 so we need to move. I was blown away by the amazing customer service of Latoya. When I walked in she greeted me with a smile. Then she proceeded to ask me what size unit I needed and I had no idea. I thought I knew. I had no idea. So she helped me find one that fit into my budget. She showed me a couple of them we ended up going with the broom closet. Haha. I was with my one year old son and Latoya was kind enough to go into her own lunch to get him a snack. Everything we did was met with please, thank you, you're welcome Etc. She was so kind I am most definitely bringing my family back because they need storage units to just based on her customer service. Thank you again to Latoya. You made my day by being your awesome self. Keep up the great work.</review>

Break-ins are extremely rare at our company; this is the first one I can remember in years. But that doesn’t make it any less painful for you. We did look for the video footage, but as you noted, it was already expired. And we allowed you to examine the dumpster with the hopes that your pictures would be in there. Please be assured that this was not an “inside job.” Our management team is professional and honest. Our other on-line reviews attest to the positive experiences from other customers. Again, I apologize for this incident and you can contact me at kraig@sdss1.com if you would like to discuss it further.'}<//response><gmap_id>0x80dc75508063fb69:0xc87badcdfdc0ffe8< /gmap_id><text>If I could I would give no stars but since that's not an option....
Brings me to great regret to ever store my personal belongings here! I Pay them every month for years to keep my personal items safe  & secure ! What I'm actually paying for is them to record my stuff getting stolen yet "nothing looks out of the ordinary " on the video footage ! And them not doing anything about it AND I DO MEAN NOTHING! I'm sorry miss zamora there's nothing we can do, is what they said ! you mean there's NOTHING your going to do , there's no possible way to get my daughters baby pictures/ family pictures / my mom who is no longer with us her only memories I had to share with my kids , family members who are no longer with us all of my memories of my childhood gone just like that ? Definitely an Inside Job or they know who did it and there are covering their tracks .  Filing for a police report was not much help either there was time sensitive footage ( which the storage facility did not mention to myself or the officer who took my report) so I had to take their word for it , it took  10 days to even get a call back from the detective " I'm sorry but there's nothing I can do since there's no footage anymore it's a lost cause " are you kidding me ? It's no murder case but these stolen items my stolen items are mine ! I've searched the storage facility dumpster no luck and the surrounding areas dumpsters as well ! Well Thanks for nothing Mini Storage San Marcos and San Marcos Sheriff Department, only for the amount of suffering and stress you have caused me just as my depression has seemed to be controlled I've yet spiraled back into it countless sleepless nights and the feeling  of sense of security and trust is gone ! So please anyone who stores with this facility or any other company I would check on your stuff and make sure they are actually doing there lock checks etc! Because your stuff could just vanish into thin air just like that ! ALL I WANT IS MY PICTURES KEEP THE REST ! KARMA WILL CATCH-UP  I PROMISE YOU AND IT BETTER BEFORE I DO .........<//text>< user_id>

Not familiar with the area I found this site on the internet.  I called and was impressed with the response from the gentleman's answers.  I reserved a spot by phone because I liked the idea that it was a month to month contract as I only need it for one month.  Also because of their policy I was given 1/2 off for the 1st month.  When I arrived and made contact with the office staff, I was impressed with the professionalism.  I very much like that my items are insured while there, the security, the cleanliness and location.  I highly recommend it.<//review>

$20 administration fee and yet they can't throw in a free lock (compared to $15 w/free lock). You gotta ask for permission to use their dumpster cuz they don't want to clean messy dumpsters. They lend you a truck to move but only for 1 hour and an employee has to drive it. The truck isn't available on Sundays which is the best time to move for most people. It's expensive compared to other locations which offer more, you get 2 months at 50%, but you HAVE TO pay both months up front then it jumps to ridiculous rates (that's how they get you).<//Review>

I’d like to briefly address them:  The administration fee is standard in our industry and the $20 that we charge is lower than the national brands.  It is true that we manage the dumpster use on our properties because we feel that keeping those areas safe and tidy is important to everyone.  Our moving truck is a popular service and most people are pleased with how the program works.  We were voted San Diego’s Best storage company the past two years and we are not out to “get you” or anyone else.  We offered this customer 50% off the first two months as a promotional tool to make storing with us an even better value.'}</Response><GmapID>0x80dc75508063fb69:0xc87badcdfdc0ffe8<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>As I am about 500 miles distant, San Marcos Mini Storage helped eliminate stress by the services they offer. Their free truck and driver is absolutely indispensable, as I'm so distant and I have two surgeries pending (do call them ahead of time, to know time slot, since time slots are reserved for truck and driver). I'm informed the manager himself drove the truck (NO LABOR PROVIDED, of course (of course), merely free truck and free driver, yet are VERY USEFUL EVEN WITHOUT LABOR PROVIDED, one cannot reasonably expect a free driver and truck plus labor be at no charge) and the front desk accommodated my requests and the extreme stress at an "impossible situation" was handled with merely three days of planning (extreme stress) and from so remote a location (they did require the local acquaintance of mine put their name on the contract, as security, since I couldn't be present, and they'll switch the contract to my name when I visit face to face). I'm glad I located San Marcos Mini Storage, kindly do refer them/mention them if you're so "connected to mention them at the right time." They offer move-in specials, also, on select units, and were very respectful of my "distance" needs, courteous AND nice, like they like where they work. THANK YOU, San Marcos Mini Storage representatives! I learned to firmly compliment where compliments are due.</Review>< Pics>

We have been renting two storage units here for more than 5 years and they have more than doubled the rental rate. Gate access hours are unreasonably short.</Review>

Dave has been amazing at helping set us up with the right size of storage.  The place is always amazingly clean and everything works wonderfully.  Dollys are always where they’re supposed to be and I can’t say enough great things about this storage facility.<//review>

(Translated by Google) The young man who attended to me is my kind and courteous showed us all that interested us and we chose one ... everything very clean and the place is always guarded ... the only thing that I would have loved is that it was 24 hours ... good promotions and then Another girl arrived and equally kind and smiling, that is to be grateful ... that they always receive you very well ... even the boy always offered us fresh water entering ... Great. Anyway highly recommended.

El joven q me atendió es mi amable y cortés nos mostró todos los q nos interesaba y escogimos uno..todo muy limpio y siempre está vigilado el lugar..lo único q me hubiese encantado es q fuera 24 horas..buenas promociones y después llegó otra chica e igualmente amable y sonriente,eso es de agradecerse...el q siempre te reciban muy bien...hasta el chico siempre nos ofrecía agua fresca entrando..Genial. En fin muy recomendable.😃<//text>

< review>
Used to eat here a long time ago, but had to put them on the no fly list cause they kept getting orders wrong. Thought I'd give them another chance today cause my daughter suggested it. Thought they might have fixed the problem. But no! Went through drive thru. What a train wreck! Cars stacked up everywhere after the drive thru waiting for their orders. Employees running around in a panic (seriously) trying to find which order goes where. My order visited 3 other cars before I got it. AND THEY GOT MY ORDER WRONG AGAIN!!! They forgot my daughter's entree. We had to flag down the poor girl who was desparetly trying to match orders with cars. She said, "okay, I'll bring it right out."  Nope. We saw her continuing to literally run around to match up other people's orders. She forgot about us. I don't fault her. She was beyond stressed. We never got the rest of the order. This store is so badly managed and the extra drive thru business during the pandemic didn't force them to fix what was broken. They are apparently happy running a broken business. UNLESS YOU ENJOY DISAPPOINTMENT, STAY AWAY FROM THIS STORE! STAY FAR AWAY!!!!! McDonalds used to be the fast food industry standard of excellence. But these days, they have fallen so far from being the standard. We should have gone to Chick-fil-A. They are the new industry standard. Lesson learned!</review>

I was in the drive thru by 10:30am but due to the line I couldn’t order until 10:32am and they told me they couldn’t make breakfast after 10:30am even though I was only 2 mins late and already in line at 10:30am! So then I had to wait in line just to get nothing!< /Text>

This location has learned how to organize and coordinate between drive thru, cashier and food pickup.  Lines go fairly fast and everyone inside is wearing masks.  Food is hot and good. Occasionally one must drive around the side of the building to pickup food, but that makes it more efficient for everyone. Edited minor typo.< /text>

I was put out in front in spot 1 to wait for "HASHBROWNS" 10 minutes later I went inside, to witness 4 employees standing around watching an employee fuss with some machine. Then what appeared to be the mamager said " we have 4 bags that someone can take out. She had to say this 3 times before an employee turned to take them. I grabbed my bag and left. I was very close to being late for work, when I should have been there early.< /Text>

Absolutely the worst. They never get my order right and I am always asked to pull forward and wait even for something as simple as a coffee. Not only have I had to wait many, many times, but then I have been given an order that is completely wrong which means pulling back through and more waiting. My average waiting time here is 17 min aftet I've been asked to pull foward.< /Review>

The manager Trisha or Trina couldnt hear The exact name was extremely off putting. I found her behavior towards her employees to be appalling and found myself offended. She was screaming at them from behind the counter and treating them more like cattle than people. It was unpleasant and actually ruined my meal and makes me not want to go back to this location. You could see the dread on the staff. Also it was slow and I blame it on her mismanagement of the order queue. My food was cold when it came out. It wasnt super busy either. I pity the employees and hope you find someone to teach her leadership and make them motivated to work for their leader.

Could have butchered the name. Whoever the leader was on 12/15/19 at around 9:15pm<//Text>

This will be the last time I go here. I don't like to have to walk through the gross mini-mart to get to the restaurant.  The place inside was filthy. Lots of uncleared tables, trash all over the floor, grubby fingerprints on the windows, doors, metal surfaces, etc. Several people were getting upset at the staff because their orders were taking too long. They asked me three times whether I wanted it to go or to dine in, and each time I said 'to go'. When they brought my food out it was on a tray. Just one of several irritations.

Their drive up menu prices are always less than what they charge you at the drive up window. The menus inside are difficult to understand. Most of the time the fries are cold and stale and the burgers are a squished mess.

Very sad for such a huge, family-oriented company.<//Review>

Ordered at Drive thru: no McFlurry listed on the menu. I asked the cashier that I do not see any of the McFlurry listed. He responded that they have Oreo or M&Ms. (ok, M&Ms) I just paid $2.90. Then went to the second window. The lady asked if I ordered the M&Ms McFlurry. I told her yes. She handed out and I was shocked! She was already walked away before I could say anything! Is that how you fill the ice cream in the cup? See picture.<//text>

The Mc D's on willow and nees was horrible, Nasty dirty, took 18 minutes to get a frappe.  The person taking orders didnt know what they were doing.
Food was piling up, and mo one knew who it belonged to.
Unacceptable.
Wont be going to this one ever again.< /Review>

<response>None</response><text>The dirty McDonald's I have ever been in. I mean dirty. Every time I go there it's always filthy and the trash cans are always overflowed. Specially not the kids area. That's the only reason I go there because of the kids area for my three kids. This week I took the whole family including my wife who has never seen me clean the tables off for the restaurant. Yes I cleaned off seven tables before picking up my order.  She even told the manager what I was doing.  Her disappointment was they were trying to give her old cold fries.  So we waited and got our fresh fries after we finished our meals.  The only thing that was appropriate was an opollogy for the fries being late.  Hope they can change. It a nice location to have a dirty fast food place.  Good luck.< /text>< pics>

Customer service is horrible. The girl tried to give me the wrong order. When I said no she dropped it in my car. When I went in to complain, the manager, Crystal, ignored me and acted like I wasn't there. Then I saw a girl in the back picking her nose right by the toasted buns. This place is discusting. Bad food bad service.</Text>

First bad experience here yesterday. Must not have has adequate staff. They provided the wrong burger and the fries were not fully cooked. 2 small meals and one large meal was $21, not worth the poor quality.< /Text>

<user_name>Rohan Kodali< /user_name><Review>One of the most filthiest, smelliest McDonald's restaurants I have ever seen in my life. The floors and tables are very dirty. The kitchen looks like there is lots of oil and grease and food spilled all over. There are flies and mosquitos all over the place, bathrooms produce a very horrible smelly scent that can be smelled outside the bathroom, and the convenience store attached mainly sells liquor/beer/Marlboro cigarettes. Also, the icecream machine almost never works here. There were quite a few times when I have wanted to try the stoopwafel Mcflurry or get a hot fudge sundae but could not because the icecream machine is broken and nobody cares to fix it. I do not even know why such a badly run McDonald's like this one even exists but I think it should be inspected and closed by the health department. Or this McDonald's should at least be completely demolished and rebuilt/ remodeled and the convenience store absolutley needs to be shut down. Probably the convenience store is playing a major role in keeping this particukar McDonald's extremely filthy. Also, my orders always take way too long to be made here.< /Review><Resp>None<//Resp><Date>1563647991990</Date><pictures>None</pictures>< Rating>

If I could give them a lower score I would! This place was HORRIBLE! It had been hit and miss in the past but it is one of the few locations with a play area inside where we can all get some relief from the 110° weather. When we walked in the kids immediately went back to the play area they had and all 3 came back out and said, "they didn't want to play in there because it was too hot". Mind you, we live on the other side of town and only come here because it is so nice for the kids to play in a protected environment. We decided to sit just outside the play area on the other side of the wall of glass separating the two areas of the restaurant. My wife and 3 children went to order our food, that was okay but the ice cream machine was down with a polite sign stating that the machine was down so no shakes or Mac flurry drinks. Only coffee bases drinks. FOR CHILDREN! I don't think so! Ordered our food and proceeded to pour our drinks.... No ice! In either of their two giant bins attached atop of the beverage dispensers. So we politely ask to have our cups filled with ice only to have not one but two employees argue with us and assured my wife and I that only one of the two work and we would have to get ice out of the "far one". We both politely told them, "No.... they are both empty"! We did get ice after a little haggling with the counter person, went to our table to wait for our order. In a reasonable amount of time a very nice young lady brought out HALF OF OUR ORDER. My wife went up to the front and asked the young lady for the rest of our order. She asked for the receipt, which my wife handed to her and the young lady again, just wanted to question my wife. THE LADY JUST BROUGHT IT TO OUR TABLE and she asks, " Did you go through the drive through"? She politely told the young lady, " the order was just brought out to our table and the order number is still on the table". Meanwhile everyone else's order is now getting cold. No offer to give us fresh hot fries because now the fries we have already received are getting cold while we wait for the staff to figure out what to do. I have experienced bad service from this particular location several times, flies, dirty tables, extreme heat in the restaurant. This one takes the cake! I will NEVER return to this location again! The prices are just as high as any sit down restaurant and I don't understand why they can't run the air conditioning in the play area, they certainly have the money. I may just never go to McDonald's again, period!< /review>

80% of the time they put cream instead of sugar in my coffee and many times they give me the wrong food in my order. This is very frustrating when you are at the drive through window. I always have to check everything to make sure they didn't mess up a simple order. I don't know how the words sugar and cream translate into Spanish but it might be a good idea to hire English speaking employees.<//text>

<review>Every single time I order drive thru, they always make me pull ahead to the mobile order spots and adds an extra five-ten minutes. What's the point of having a drive thru when you can't even complete someone's order? All of the staff are rude and don't even apologize for the inconvenience. Absolutely horrible. Just go to another location.</review>< Pictures>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>This particular McDonald's used to have good customer service and management. Lately EVERY time I go thru the drive-thru I have to wait out front in parking place for my order which takes FOREVER! (And sometimes they forget you.) The last two times they have brought me someone else's order. My hamburger was dry and the meat had definitely been sitting there. Whenever you are asked to pull around and wait be prepared to have VERY COLD fries. This unfortunately is just the Drive-thru problem now let's go inside. I used to like to take my daughter in the kids area to play but it has gotten so dirty in there and your can literally smell the germs lol. I think they wipe down the tables and that's it. They sweep don't think they mop and when was the last time you guys cleaned the actual play equipment? Aside from that the temperature in that room in the Summer is extremely HOT and Winter is extremely COLD completely different from the inside of the restaurant. Not at all fair to the kids. When you order at the counter you can tell the employees are scrambling like there is no order on how things work. ( I blame management) because of this the frustration of staff is high which brings down the quality of customer service. There really needs to be some additional training on quality of food, customer service, and cleanliness of the play area. Oh by the way I asked for the new donut sticks which this location advertised on thier menu board and was told they didn't even sell them! I'm so confused about the false advertisement. Get it together Willow and Nees location because this is very sad.< /Text>< Pictures>

On a Saturday afternoon, I ordered a Quarter Pounder Deluxe combo with a large coke. When my order was ready, I was given a Quarter Pounder with cheese: no fries no coke. They compensated me by giving me large fries for free, and also gave me the large coke (it was paid for). I had to wait 10 minutes for the Quarter Pounder Deluxe, which was very inconvenient. By then, my fries were cold. I don’t plan on visiting this location again.</Review>

<review>Very unorganised and chaotic my visit was awful .  I went through the drive-through and they told me to wait for the rest of my food and ended up waiting for over a half hour before I went in to talk to the manager and she tried to ignore me.  The rest of the staff was very nice but the manager was very rude.< /review></record>

If u have kids, just throw me out in the playpen and soak up some calories. Convenient hand sanitizer dispensers is nice. However, it might not be the best place for those that don't have/aren't around kids. The staff does a pretty good job keeping things clean. Also there's a gas station/minimart that shares the building. 4 out of 5 stars on a good day.<//text>

Play structure is amazing here, and separate from half of the restaurant. Food generally takes a little longer, and apple pies take 20 minutes that last two times.</Review>

When I finally complained,  and threatened to call the Health Department,  it was repaired.  The ice machine is always down,  The ATM machine is down alot.  They always have  a sign stating they are only taking cash.  Who is running this franchise????  The other McDonald's on Nees and 1st provide a much better run establishment.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
You order a Banana milkshake, you get Strawberry. You go back andthen return with a Mango crushed water-ice thing... What is so difficult about a Banana Shake?  The French fries was kindy like French salt with some fries in between. Don't they educate the people working there?<//Review>

Cashier was rude. Pretty sure he hates life. Waited 10 minutes for a to go order and realized the bag on the counter employees have been shuffling around and digging in was in fact, mine. No number was called as I was right at the counter listening. Food cold and stale. Won't be back to this location.</Text>
