Solid spot for coffee!

Bright, modern, clean shop with good coffee, a few noshes, and fresh flower bouquets on offer! Service was quick, and the coffees were delicious. They use Stumptown coffee, not sure about the tea. Menu is simple but has just about everything you’d need. They have some outdoor seating available, and it looks like post-covid will be a nice spot to sit inside too.</review>

They have great coffee and great sandwiches for bagels, and the service is fast! I've been here a couple of times, and they're consistent with the flavor of their coffee, their bagels. They had the friendliest and most welcoming workers I have ever met. I highly recommended their latte, and this coffee shop is a must-visit!<//Text>

This shop serves the best chocolate, coffee, espresso, and cappuccino that you will ever satisfy in! The atmosphere is pleasant and cheerful. This coffee shop never fails to entertain and amaze me. After a long day of excursion, this is the best place to kick back and talk about your day. We love their coffee so much!< /Text>

Coffee is robust, smooth, excellent. Matcha latte the best I’ve had in all of the west side- they use ceremonial matcha- creamy, just the right amount of grassiness without being bitter or weak. Drinks are excellent all around and folx are kind, patient and friendly.<//text>

< review>
I loved the coffee shop after going in today for the first time.  I found out that it is family owned which of course was music to my ears considering I want to open up a coffee shop one day in the future.
The coffee was a little on the expensive side.  However it was worth it.  (I payed $5.00 for an ice coffee).  The only thing I didn't like about it was the fact that there was no place to charge your phone or laptop.  I would still recommend the coffee shop if your out with friends on a lazy afternoon.</review>

The atmosphere was clean and bright and open. I've only tried an Americano so far, but it was perfect.< /Review>

<review>I really enjoyed the hot vanilla latte with CBD in it. Nice flavor and light foam. I’d like more information on where the CBD they have comes from since there’s many makers of it and not all CBD is the same. Some manufacturers of CBD can be pitting little to no CBD with toxins.</review>< Pictures>

<text>Do to logistics I had to look for a bigger unit. As soon as I got there, the lady at the station (Valery) was extremely serviceable and helpful as I was inquiring for options. She helped me to select the best of all with transparency and took care of the whole process. The customer service and the attention was outstanding and the units and location are on point. I totally recommend StoragePro. Thanks Valery..😉<//text>< pics>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>The staff were very friendly and helpful, the facility was clean and secure. Unfortunately the opening of the unit was too narrow for my trailer due to the angle at which I had to enter , there was less than 6 inches on either side and I have a 22 foot trailer and a crew cab long bed…. Needless to say my rig is long and although the isles are wide I was still unable to come in at an angle that would allow me to safely enter the unit without jackknifing or scraping the sides of my food trailer. The manager was awesome and tried to contact another tenant that was in a larger unit to see if he wanted to downsize but was unable to get ahold of him. Thank you for all your effort to try to accommodate me.<//Text>< Pictures>

We finally located a large enough Storage Unit yesterday to accommodate the rest of our belongings that will stay behind (from house, yard, & garage) after our initial truckload made it to Texas. The young lady at StoragePRO in Vacaville was friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, courteous, & cooperative! Couldn't ask for better service, especially in the trying times!<//Text>

I chose Storage Pro from a friends recommendation & I’m glad I did. From being shown different sizes of units, which also gave me a tour around the facility,  to being offered 1 of 2 promotions when filling out the contract, The customer service I received from Mackenzie was very genuine & made me feel this was a great decision! The office was clean as well as the storage units and the security of the location put me at ease. I highly recommend this place.< /Review>

Let me just say how pleased I am with this place!  I have used storage facilities in the past, but this one was like no other.  The units are extremely clean as is the whole property itself.  Another plus is that the unit’s ceilings are very high.   It is also a very spacious property with so much room to load/unload and not have to worry about blocking the flow.  But let me not forget about the customer service I received!  From the initial confirmation phone call down to the regular interactions on the property.  This place exceeds expectations!</text>

Great big spaces and the girl who helped us was very nice BUT when we were told all about the prices and types of units it wasn’t until after we rented it that now you have to pay extra a month to use the outlet in our unit. Then we got a 15x48 unit yet we measured after renting it  and the entry way door is only 12ft wide and the inside is only 14 feet wide. Feels like false advertisement to me to me. We even measured the things we needed inside and we got a 15 ft wide for a reason.  Less space and more money for an outlet. Beware< /review>

Please feel free to reach out to us at (707) 244-7867."}< /resp><text>I'm very disappointed with Storage Pro, Walnut Ave., Vacaville.  Signed up for first 3 months 50% off for a total of $39.00 per month.  That was great!  Then yesterday I was going to pay my 4th month rent which should have been $78 and when I went to hand the lady the money, she said I owed $164.  I told her that was incorrect, that I had signed up for 3 months 50% off at $39 so my regular rate couldn't be $164.  She said that they did not have that type of promotion and made no attempt to try to figure out a solution to this problem.
I called the corporate office and was told I would get a call back today from the district manager for the area but did not get a call back. I'm going to find my contract (if there was one) and contact the Better Business Bureau and perhaps they will be able to help me get this resolved.</text><user>101859423336670057745< /user></record></dataset><record>

Ashley and the 2 others that helped were great.  I only remember Ashley's name because she was the first one to help us. she was very diligent and actually walked out on the property 2 shoot maybe 3 times to make sure we were getting the units we needed as close together as possible!!! Love her customer service love the kind upbeat energy and the go to attitude and just because I'm horrible with names doesn't mean that the other 2 werent just as fabulous. Thanks ladies you have made this the best storage experience in all my 25 years of storage facilities!!! I will be applauding and recommending u to everyone!!< /text>

This place is new and still has "brand new" prices/move in deals. Reasonable hours, I like the fact that access hours extend past store hours, so no rushing to be done with your business before close of business. Staff was friendly and courteous, very explanatory, and I am confident the rental period will be as smooth sailing as the experience I had with them today. Thanks storagepro.<//Review>

<text>We recently purchased a 38 foot Formula powerboat and were looking for an easy and convenient location to store it.  Over all length with the trailer is about 45 feet!  Unfortunately storage solutions for a boat that size are limited!  StoragePros had a beautiful easy accessible unit that is both convenient and affordable!  Thank you and looking forward to a long relationship with them!

It is a good park, located 3 blocks away from downtown, the playground is in good condition. However, there is plenty of homeless people sitting or sleeping on the picnic area. So, unfortunately the kids wont be able to eat there or hang around.< /Text>

I tried to take my Daughter there to play in the playground. Unfortunately it was overrun with homeless and unsavory characters.  I felt   uncomfortable and feel like it's unsafe for a little girl to play. As you can see 11 other people thought this was a issue.< /Text>

It's a nice park, no bathrooms tho. There used to be a lot of homeless people but I believe that have moved on. I wish that they had a water fountain that had cold water, because it gets so hot in the the summertime.< /Review>

<Review>Overall you can tell the area is trying to keep it clean. Good equipment, nice mulch, mostly fenced. Biggest drawback is the homeless that collect on the other side of fence.</Review>< time>

I truly enjoyed the atmosphere on the 3 path bar tasting and wish to go back for dinner in the eating room in the future. The bar become quite exciting thinking about that it's far a three Michelin big name eating place. I actually desired to like this experience however it changed into marred with the aid of one in all our pals who wanted to drink wine which was quite accurate, but the cocktails appeared a long way more exciting as there had been many handmade flavored liquors in evidence and the barkeep became very informed. I did enjoy the meals, but again hypercritical feedback marred this issue as properly. splendid service and high-quality memoir meals gift on the stop. hope to go back inside the destiny.</Text>

I really enjoyed the atmosphere at the 3 course bar tasting and hope to return for dinner in the dining room one day. The bar was quite interesting considering that it is a 3 Michelin star restaurant. I really wanted to love this experience but it was marred by one of our friends who wanted to drink wine which was quite good, but the cocktails seemed far more interesting as there were many handmade flavored liquors in evidence and the barkeep was very knowledgeable. I did enjoy the food, but again hypercritical comments marred this aspect as well. Great service and nice memoir food gift at the end. Hope to return in the future.< /review>

< Review>
We like a lot hanging out. Yesterday we arrived in this delicious restaurant which we didn’t know before. We enjoyed a lovely evening there with great food and a professional crew and a great cook. We  added this restaurant in our list  and we shall surely visit again soon. We highly recommend.< /Review>

<text>We had dinner inside the kitchen and got to see the disciplined team work and skilled chefs working side-by-side. The best part was perhaps actually engaging with the waiters and cooks as they were all stellar people with interesting backgrounds. We had fun conversations alongside excellent food.

The atmosphere of having dinner inside the kitchen is special and I've only done this at Alexander Steakhouse before in the past when they were still doing it.

Head and sous are also very involved with their craft, was totally involved the whole time with perfecting each dish...

Would definitely recommend due to fine dining and service.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXvoEZN8-2fTLMLneSsBEz9483SwuME3w3S506=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMV5xRKA7rZXN_MVyzy-ApdTxOWGA4oI7cbmUv9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3olPKAen0sxq0D-0WVQfALu_5sPL_qe19j9yz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAyWkMv4MGGq-H7IuqR6YI133Yh4D9lWOfIWoU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfLj8FfsVjDg7eSmeN6pjcAq1ea3iL12rI_Qpx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyULeDBA_-25EFJnLY3ixhuBhcEP_8c1h2uFBw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4V1ezADtS5updEkGBkydXLuDBedehPSP_rS-f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5Tuio6Ly5Vx0X5QT0lbzHC3qrQ22gSnou9Wlh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqFoOVzluXNXJUd8ZCjjKBlnE0h6V8wIEDAnUK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPunRaTstuL4ZFTbOZW1TRPrNQVKZZpMzzLlgum=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80845a0cff5dcc35:0x461758da6096d1c9< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<date>1555224788838<//date><Text>Oh my word!  My sweetheart got us a reservation at the Chef's Table in the Kitchen, and were we ever treated to every conceivable delight the restaurant has to offer!?  I'm really sorry I can't tell you much, as things were very rapid-fire as staff brought one thing and then another, and we were treated to bits of delightfulness that were "extra" of what went out to the tables in the dining room.  This place is worthy of the most special occasion, and I was extremely fortunate that my significant other wanted to share an evening with me, and The Restaurant at Meadowood.  Just look at these photos and try not to find your mouth watering!</Text>< resp>

What a great getaway spot! The atmosphere and outdoor dining was wonderful. Felt one with the nature! The service and food was exceptional. My favorite dishes were the abalone and cod. Still thinking about them the day after... I would love to come back here again.< /Review>

For our 20th anniversary we chose 20 of the best restaurants in the Bay Area. Meadowood is clearly one of the best, but not 5 stars for both of us. Meadowood is definitely at the top end of high-end restaurants, and the man at the gate assumed we were heading to the grill when we pulled up in our 15-year-old Minivan for dinner. Certainly that was a safe assumption considering the cost of a meal here.
Meadowood is exactly what you expect from a top quality restaurant. Everything about the experience is polished. After the meal we were even invited to tour the amazing kitchen and found out that you can have a special meal in there!
We had a huge variety of dishes, many of which were the best of their kind among all the great restaurants we have been to. Like others have mentioned in their reviews the desserts are not quite up to par with the rest of the meal. The Oil Oil Pudding we had was great, but the candied garden was not special.
Why not 5 stars? Certainly the meal and experience at the restaurant were 5 star quality, however my wife had severe stomach issues after the meal. She often had stomach issues after these large tasting menus, but this was beyond that. I had no issues at all, and the meal had so many different items that impossible to know what the problem was.</Text>

<Review>One of the most beautiful dining rooms and kitchens I’ve ever had the pleasure dining in.

The dining room faces out into the Forrest and you really get he feel for cuisine which focuses on foraging for ingredient in the area.

Service was top notch, staff were very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.

Wine and cocktail list was extensive.

The food however was lacking in my opinion.
I can’t fault the execution or technique but the flavor combinations for many of he dishes we not to my liking. And the foraged ingredients....some should have stayed in a the forest. I do understand the philosophy and concept of foraging, but if the produce isn’t up to standard or unavailable from foraging, I’d rather source from farmers and producers instead of risk sticking to foraging for the sake of it.

But then again this was my first time dining in a restaurant whose focus foraging and may have unreasonable expectations before coming here.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOg7xK-wJiKlnSVvcgy6pamaFXSUrBVbZQz5bg0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIro3KMpT20xoOppHjEJ4Q9rENt2l5dPl8mCKS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwtAXHXNkOilN9p9Ug0Ozlow6XZJVTRI8ltJV3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4uWTE-mdgHs0xz6_Z_7xc2MTklfKsmqE3cf84=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJiY03pxAHnvfeDhsCWMVEMzKqZF7ZyahHb9mQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQAorCJxeciU5lp_E1TGR_UUNjfnheu-V504Sl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBTw9EMx38ZMu0FW9-tt4Zj0Fpp7lPCBY434Vr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODqyfUui_0WT_92m_VqIMdCs2FPbZ3erf-EAOa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMd2M6o6hwQ6hFkaJ-qhsejA72imVYNAEkXVKfM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZE4htEWvUzR9KyLePtc42jeov2fRwuVJo1CRP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXrIFe2SaC9noNcJajMZO_eLwq3y1x4ulg7Ntv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipManRAxcX8NQZIqcaFt69gsGML1F9Vg79hENcV4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1-Q_RFs6vUXZAr502mPmbAwpNxxNZuiYlFdx0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQbK0a3Tb3-MRS8Ls8RQV-exAxGA3CBeOJ6Wrx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbucKGylMCtpUwL_CZ8QZVCSD7DcNB13mHkrVD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlnbqyqj7wYNJhO4B8944G1EJMHJE0rRmPVpbB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjiGoeBc6myFdfoS3YmXIYp-TTCUTcaDazkQvg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8XVD4HEZmPRyqb2_yI_WOJbTRUNp_lK7xaM7H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOG5IeZblijo0pOTfZDXquwyCnu5vwAFDXltU8i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGk-MaAyqekmC2ylVnKrBEuW8ntKkZLrI_f_3f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN08p9_RwqZYpOBDaiT8_BXIlVNga4DBJLmvoRR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

The definition of a 3-star Michelin is "exceptional cuisine that is worth a special journey". Unfortunately the Spring '19 menu did not meet this high bar, and it is with some consternation that I write this less-than-perfect review, because our experience here was quite wonderful.

So let's begin with all that the Restaurant had done right -- the ambiance, the location, and especially the SERVICE. The Restaurant at Meadowood is itself nestled within the resort, up a short but scenic tree-lined drive. The gate man, the valet, the host were all very friendly and attentive, and we were promptly ushered into a calming and serene location -- exposed wood, solid stone, leather chairs, perfectly placed lighting, Zalto glasses, and even a faux tree. The service staff was superb, wonderful (but also appropriate) wine recommendations by the Somm, followed by a consistent and delicate dance of 6 plates hitting the table within 10 seconds during each of the 16+ times they were served and subsequently cleared -- mesmerizing to watch. Also important, taxes and gratuity are included (and the staff helpfully mentioned this again at the end of the meal), saves one from the anxiety and mental gymnastics of calculating a living wage subsidy, guilty of not doing it properly, or the regret of overdoing it.

TL;DR: this place was fancy a-f, and tasteful at it.

But alas, the crux of Michelin's guide (which navigated us here), is one based in cuisine, and the majority of the dishes left something to be desired. The theme, for the Spring '19 menu, is likely one rooted in ingredients, farm-to-table, hyper-local, [insert buzzword], there is no presentation, no flair, no frills, no pizzazz -- which is something we have grown accustomed to with Michelin "destinations" -- a Disneyland for your mouth; a Broadway play for your palate. This ... was much more simple. Perhaps zen?

Prior to the meal, a basket of fresh vegetables was brought out -- perhaps the same that went into our dishes? We were not sure. On asking why the asparagus is white, the presenter just rehearsed the same line (but I Googled it -- it was because it was sun/chlorophyll deprived -- by growing completely submerged in soil or covering with a tarp, the result is a more fibrous and milder ... asparagus).

The dishes were brought out one by one, properly spaced, interjected with the few bottles of aptly paired wines we had ordered. However, few were particularly memorable: 1. the salad roll tasted... green; 2. the baby potatoes tasted... like my garden potatoes; 3. the beignet chestnut had a good texture; 4. the miso oyster nasturtium (a perennial weed) was fresh; 5. the white asparagus was cooked and chilled to perfection, the pacific rock crab and wild onion flavorful; 6. the escabeche of broccoli clams tasted of al dente broccoli, and fine textured clams; 7. the caviar smoked tendon cultured butter sabayon was DELICIOUS, like a perfectly integrated red wine it just all melded together -- this was the single dish we probably came for; 8. abalone and cabbage, meh; 9. local sole cover crop, meh; 10. duck tea followed by pekin duck, had much better in Beijing, the risotto (specifically noted that it was made with CA rice! i.e. Cal-rose which accounts for more than 90% of rice consumed in the US?) was on the salty side and did not quite showcase the duck; 11. the slow cooked pork collar, interesting kohlrabi texture but taste was lacking; 12. black truffle veined blue cheese with beeswax pear and charter oak bread -- this screamed "lazy chef", the blue cheese completely overpowered any truffle aroma, olfactory or taste; 13. yogurt cultured with almond blossoms rhubarb sorrels - not sure what the almond flowers did for this dish, but the presentation was somewhat pretty, tasted like yogurt; 14. bay leaf ice cream with a chocolate ball over a bay leaf sprig - good and unique ice cream flavor, perfect texture; 15. last bites - cute box, but snacks were reminiscent of Asian grocery store knick knacks.

In sum... good food? Yes. "Exceptional cuisine that is worth a special journey?" No.</review>

<Text>Wholeheartedly deserves all three of its Michelin stars. Unlike other restaurants of this caliber that I have visited the restaurant at Meadowood focuses on presenting ingredients in their whole and nearly complete form. The creativity and effort that goes into each dish is stunning. Service operated like a highly coordinated and well-oiled machine. The parking can be a bit difficult if there is another event like a wedding taking place at the same time. Plus tax and tip a bit over $700 makes this a place that I will only visit once every decade or so but I'm glad that I came.</Text><UserId.>109072435332370961533< /UserId.><time>1525585130958</time><name>Bill Strathearn< /name>< rate>

The restaurant focus on quality over quantity with thoughtful dishes driven by fresh ingredients. We attended one of their 12 days of Christmas holiday dinners featuring guest chefs. The meal was fabulous, integrating flavors from the guest chef with favorite Meadowood classics.</review>< pictures>

<Text>I had such a wonderful experience at this restaurant. Dillon and Aitor were great at suggesting cocktails and explaining dishes on the menu while keeping things light. The ambiance w/outdoor seating was done exceptionally. The food did not disappoint. My highlights were the Black Cod and the Alabone but all other dishes were still quite tasty. Am looking forward to the opportunity to return already, glad to have been able to attend.<//Text>< user_name>

<review>Wow, 3 Michelin stars and they earn it. The food was incredible and what was even more amazing was the level of service and attention to detail. Every staff member knew in-depth information on virtually all facets of the dinning experience and knew our names. On the food side, he had a 4 item tasting and it was great, couldn't get a res for the whole tasting but I definitely will next time I'm in Napa.< /review>< gmap_id>

My wife and I had the wine pairing and the elevated wine pairing so we could share and try all of the options. We even got to go behind the scenes and meet Chef Christopher Kostow.

One of the best fine dining experiences in the Bay area. Kitchen seats will get you insights on how the restaurant operates and the way your plates are prepared and curated. Spots are extremely limited (4 per night) especially for the weekends. Advance reservation beyond a month is necessary.< /text>

The entire staff was exceptionally friendly, professional and seemed to enjoy the experience as much as their guests.  The food and wine was an absolute delight.  Each serving presentation was as unique as the dish itself.  The servers were very creative and authentic in their delivery and explanation of each course.

<Text>My husband made Valentines plans for us to stay at the resort, and to dine in the restaurant.  We were told that only the bar area was available, despite being resort guests. He assumed we would be seated at a table in the bar area.  We were literally seated at the bar for dinner..... only viewing the bartender and bar!!
No ambience, or Valentine’s theme.  He spent over 500 dollars for small bites of chef creations!   It was absolutely ridiculous ...... so bad that I never plan to return to this restaurant again.   Btw.... the dessert on V/day was butternut squash cake!!!!   Pathetic.  We were not told the menu prior to dinner.  Given the resort, we assumed it would be good.  So not true!!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Wow great food and fantastic service. Did the wine pairing with dinner and it was amazing the combination that the chef and somilier came up with. I wish I had inquired about how many wines came with the tasting prior to getting them as there was a solid 7 or 8 glasses. Expensive but would definitely go back.</Review>

My girlfriend didnt finish half of the meals from the chef's 16?13?  course tasting menu. Overall for the price I thought I was going to be blown away, but was not. You can tell the vegetables and the produce used in the meals were of the highest quality, but just the food made was truly 1/5 stars in terms of TASTE only. I was really disappointed. I would absolutely avoid, never would I come again.</review>< gmapID>

<review>Now I know why this place got its third star. The food was great. I still remember my reaction when I took the first bite of the Japanese horse fish dish. It was that good. The service was excellent. Our waiter knew exactly how to be attentive without being intrusive. What's not to like? OK maybe the decor wasn't so hot. But then I'm not into interior design. As long as a restaurant's got good food and good service, I really could care less about the decor. And Meadowood definitely nailed it in both categories.<//review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80845a0cff5dcc35:0x461758da6096d1c9</Gmap_id></record>

<Text>This is a hard review to write, because on our first experience I would have surely given a five star rating, consistent with its Michelin stars. But, sadly our second experience was anything but five star worthy. The staff, quite contrary to what we have previously experienced, was not accommodating and verged on being rude. I must also point out that the waiter we had had at a previous visit recognized us and went out of his way to come welcome us. So perhaps we had a few people on a bad night, but bad nights aren’t supposed to happen at Michelin three stars at those prices. Plus, we had talked guests into joining us because we had raves about the service. We were, to say the least, disappointed and a bit embarrassed. Perhaps worst, my wife wrote a thoughtful note to the Resturant describing our experience, not expecting any accommodation, but assuming we’d get a response. But nope, not a word. Too bad.  A sad indication of decline???   Perhaps they can handle 2, but 6 was not good.< /Text>< Pics>

Mixed review of the Grill, not the restaurant. On the deck was excellent, chicken soup was the best ever. Menu was limited and they could not get my hamburger even close to OK. They took it back three times, no go. Fries were good, servers couldn't be nicer. No charge for the burger.<//Review>

We were expecting to be wowed, but were underwhelmed. Service was impeccable and the space is fantastic, but none of the dishes or the paired wines stood out nor were memorable. For this amount of money in a place that’s lauded by all the critics, we would expect more amazing flavors and a more creative presentation of the dishes.</Review>

Incredibly disappointing.

We dined here maybe a year and a half ago and where blown away.  We insisted our group of friends try it on our return visit and deeply regret it now. The menu started out ok with Loads of vegi options but ended with a thud of toast and cheese.  The entire group was disappointed with the meal and wondering what we paid for and hard to grasp the grand finale was toast.< /review>

I can't  speak to the dining room experience but we were arriving in late and opted for the 3 course tasting at the restaurant bar. First off understand that they force you to eat at the bar - force is not too strong a word as we asked to moved from the bar to empty tables in the bar areas twice (due to drunk patrons coming into the bar and ordering scotch over my shoulder). Each time they refused and refused in a snooty and pretentious way. Keep in mind this is a $520 prepaid non-refundable three course tasting menu. Why they wouldn't move us and get us away from the noise in the Rotunda and the drunk scotch drinkers is beyond me. The courses were minuscule and we left there hungry and angry at the experience. I shared our frustration with the bar manager and his response was come back and we will do better next time - but didn't have the decency to comp our pre-dinner cocktails. With so many great choices for excellent food in Napa - steer clear of this restaurant - you have been warned.<//Review>< Resp>

One of our top five favorite restaurants in the world. The combination of creativity in developing the dishes with perfect execution is rare! In addition both the flawless, discrete service and the understated decor create the perfect atmosphere for a special evening!<//Text>

< review>
We planned a very special meal for my in-laws’ 44th wedding anniversary and took them to the fine dining restaurant at Meadowood. We assumed this would be a lovely evening and exceptional meal considering the high ratings and the premium pricing - we were VERY wrong. The meal was awful! Each dish, starting from the first bites (amuse bouche) were texturally wrong and bizarre tasting. Even though, when asked by the servers if we were enjoying the meal, we honestly told them that the seasoning and flavors were not right, we were charged full price at the end of the night and were never offered any alternatives or any compensation of any kind. Even a very modest self-respecting restaurant would offer to bring you food of some kind that you would enjoy! No such thing happened here. We were thoroughly underwhelmed at the quality and overall flavor of the meal, and ultimately we felt so bad that the anniversary dinner for my in-laws was ruined! We will NEVER be able to recommend this restaurant. We have dined around the world at some of the finest establishments, including The French Laundry (which is comparable in price), and we have truly never experienced a meal that was this bad - absolutely inedible - and SO expensive.  Unless you enjoy soapy, burnt-tasting food, you’ll be wildly disappointed and seriously regretting the purchase.< /review>

<resp>None</resp><text>Unlike French Laundry, I was blown away by almost every bite of food at Meadowood. The service was as good as it could have possibly been and the dining room was spacious and comfortable. The seats at the tables were also large and comfortable which is something that is often overlooked, and something that is very necessary when you sit down for three hours for a meal.
The only disappointing thing was the wine list being marked up 5x, but that is almost to be expected at highly rated restaurants.< /text><user>115619047556375390506</user><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

<text>Absolutely one of my favorite dining experiences on our trip.  You must make reservations and you must dress well.  We saw a guy and his date get stopped at the door because he was wearing shorts and running shoes.   But what made the whole situation amazing was the restaurant staff some how got the guy some pants to wear.  That just the level of customer service you can expect.  We had the fire side snacks and arrived early so they let us sit out in the deck to enjoy the sunset and a cocktail.  The fire side snacks were amazing.  They were servrd in 6 cources I believe.<//text>< Rating>

Not a good experience. Very high priced, which we don’t mind for a truly incredible dinner. But this was not. The chef’s main course was cow heart... disguised as “Wagyu beef”. They weren’t up front with what it really was. So if you want to spend thousands of dollars for a dinner of organ meat, this is the place for you! Worst dining experience I’ve ever had.</review>

<rating>5</rating><review>We have been to several other three star Michelin restaurants and always consistently amazed at how ingenious the food is and how amazing the service can be. The Restaurant at Meadowood is no exceptions to this. We are here and had an incredible experience from the moment we walked in the door. Great handoffs from parking to cocktails to table. Once we gave our name, we never needed to say it again. Everyone knew is by first names, incredible. We had a tasting menu, some dishes weren't to our taste, as could be expected, but all were incredible explosions of flavor and creativity. Finish with amazing wine, dessert, coffee and it leaves an incredible aftertaste that will make you remember for years to come.<//review>< Pics>

Was here for a friend's wedding and given that it's one of two Michelin star restaurants in the bay area, expectations were high... and met. Food was excellent, service was what you'd expect and the location makes it unique (although the heat that day was blistering).

Highly recommended.<//review>

<text>As a guest of Meadowood (a beautiful 5 star resort) I was shocked and stunned at the lack of creativity and quality of the dishes. The food was awful, came out on similar plates for each meal and flavors were bland. Very disappointed and wouldn't be surprised to see the restaurant lose it's Michelin rating.< /text></record>

Christopher Kostow is a creative genius backed by a seasoned kitchen staff.  We were amazed with this rare discovery during our first visit in Feb. 2014, but the real proof of the pudding was in the second encounter.  We were not disappointed this year (Apr. 2015) and actually felt the overall experience was better than last year.  The unassuming Chef Kostow graced us with his presence at our table and invited us to his kitchen.  He is very innovative and each tasting course was a visual and sensory surprise. Freshness was the order of the evening.  Service was outstanding and friendly (thank you Olin and dining room staff).  We have frequented several Michelin one, two and three star restaurants in France and discovered Meadowood to be on a par if not superior in its own right.<//Text>

<Text>This used to be my favorite 3 starred Michelin restaurant. Just recently had dinner here for my birthday and comparing to the last time I was here around this season 4 years ago, I'd have to say that I am somewhat disappointed. Everything was prepared and executed well with fresh quality ingredients as it should be since it is a 3 star Michelin but seems more like a 1 or 2 star restaurant instead. Nothing was too overpowering or too salty or too sweet which is good, but this time I didn't see as much innovation, creativity, or heart as I did 4 yrs ago. None of the dishes really stood out except maybe the first single bite amuse bouche of the savory beignet and maybe the first fish dish. I was getting sick of the 3rd raw/cured protein tasting. Textures were one-noted, I wish there was some crunch or something charred/grilled. There was this banana foster dessert without the banana on top, instead they used an eggplant (this might be considered creative but I miss the actual banana flavor!) otherwise the icecream and whiskey caramel sauce were delicious. Since it was my birthday, the card and special bday treat at the end were a nice gesture but we never received any menus to take home like the waiter had promised us when we were first seated. Last time I was here, we were given menus by the end of the meal and I couldn't get enough of one of the best desserts I have ever eaten of all restaurants which was such an amazing magical original combination of flavors of pandan leaf, toasted rice, lime, apples, and carrot malt all in a glass to drink. Why can't they do something incredible like that anymore? Seriously I was so disappointed and we were also taken back to the kitchen, lots of young cooks working hard...really what you are paying for is a lot of staffing and dish washing with well cooked but average tasting food. Food was good and nothing in particular we disliked, but not GREAT which is what should be expected for the price and the rating of this Michelin restaurant. They did try different combinations of ingredients and flavors but really nothing special. I would have rather had authentic home cooked meals by my family or eaten at some ethnic mom and pop hole in the wall. Guess I was just dreaming of my previous experience years ago which is why I had to come back. Sorry just not worth it and I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone especially if I wouldn't go back there. I almost felt uneasy there too with all the staff kind of acting and putting on a show from a script. Sometimes some people want to be left alone without small talk and other times it's appropriate, all that just felt too forced and overbearing. We understand you want our table for the next guest, we really didn't need to see the kitchen, just don't forget to give out menus< /Text><GmapID>0x80845a0cff5dcc35:0x461758da6096d1c9</GmapID>< Rating>

My husband and I celebrated our one-year anniversary at the restaurant at Meadowood, and it was a five-star experience from start to finish. Upon arrival, we were directed to the main lot where a helpful valet took our car. We were then greeted by name and escorted out to the patio overlooking the golf course, cocktail menu in hand. The hosts were gracious, helpful, and made us feel like our night would be really special, which it certainly was.

We were fortunate enough to eat at the chef's table in the kitchen, which is more expensive than the tasting menu in the dining room but well worth it because you get to witness a three-Michelin-star kitchen in action throughout your entire meal. One of the chefs delivered a personal explanation about the food and its preparation with each course. The courses start with lighter fare, move into the heavier and more meat-centric dishes, and finished with dessert. Each course was inventive and delicious. We had 14 or so different courses total, split up by a personal tour around the kitchen.

The service staff at Meadowood also delivers a stellar experience that highly compliments the amazing cuisine presented by Chef Kostow and his team. Everyone who helped us was extremely gracious and attentive, from pushing in our chairs to clearing our plates at the exact right time. The sommelier was highly knowledgable, being sensitive to our budget but also giving recommendations for wine that truly enhanced our meal. Another Meadowood bonus is that they have recently introduced a $40 tasting menu of bar snacks which does not require a reservation. The service staff did mention that on busy nights it might be hard to get in, but that we could certainly always call when in the area and they would do our best to accommodate us.

In total, this was one of the best culinary and cultural experiences we have ever had. It costs a pretty penny, but it is one of those once (or maybe twice!) in a lifetime experiences that surpasses its hefty price tag. We will hopefully be able to come back someday!</Text>

The food is made from a lot of local ingredients and very creative. The mash potato and caviar dish is my favorite and simply explode in your mouth.

Service was very good but with a few hiccups here and there. They do have an onsite sommelier that talks about different wines and does a great job.< /text>< Pics>

I was really excited to experience another michelin starred dinner in beautiful Napa Valley, but I can only say that the food was terrible.  Not one of us in our party liked ANY course.  Save your money and enjoy the French Laundry instead!<//Text>

<Text>This restaurant violates the labor laws of California by paying a "stipend" to its interns instead of the minimum wage. Please don't patronize them until they do.
........................................................................................................
For-profit employers must pay the minimum wage--not a "stipend"--or they will be sued by the Department of Industrial Relations!
Internships Are Not Free Labor!
What many job seekers and employers do not realize is that, unless a job meets certain conditions, to their interns under federal and state rules (not a "stipend," whatever that means!).
The recession, and the resulting loss of jobs, has prompted people of all experience levels to apply to companies for internships. Often they are willing to work without pay.
While many private-sector employers offer paid internships, others, inadvertently or by design, do not treat interns as employees. Instead, they label them as trainees, assistants, or learners and provide little or no pay for the work they perform. (Some offer "stipends," whatever that means!)
Federal Criteria
The federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) defines an employee broadly as "any individual employed by an employer." The FLSA definition of employ includes "to suffer or permit to work."
In 1947, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the FLSA definition does not make employees of all persons who, without any express or implied compensation agreement, may work for their own advantage on the premises of another. (Walling v. Portland Terminal Co., 330 U.S. 148.) This may apply to interns who receive training for their own educational benefit if the training meets the following six criteria (see U.S. Department of Labor Fact Sheet #71):
--The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to training that would be given in an educational environment;
--The internship is for the benefit of the intern;
--The intern does not displace a regular employee, but works under close observation of existing staff;
--The employer that provides the training from the activities of the intern and, on occasion, the employer's operations may actually be impeded;
derives no immediate advantage
--The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the completion of the internship; and
--The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship.

The U.S. Department of Labor has consistently applied these factors in response to questions about the employment status of student interns. Whether or not student interns at your organization are employees under the FLSA will depend upon all the circumstances surrounding their activities.

What Employers Should Do
In general, employers must comply with all FLSA provisions and with state laws that are more restrictive in favor of the employee or require higher pay. Employers who are planning to hire unpaid interns must review carefully federal- and state-law criteria for determining whether a worker is an employee.
If an intern should have been paid as an employee, the employer may be liable for not only wages, but also for any overtime pay, employee benefits, meal and rest periods, and penalties.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80845a0cff5dcc35:0x461758da6096d1c9</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<time>1493236412514<//time><Rating>1</Rating><Review>I want to warn you all, my fellow fine diners, about my horrible experience at Meadowood. With so many fine dining and casual dining options in the Napa Valley, I strongly urge you all to look elsewhere for your culinary needs or else risk the same problems I had during my visit and subsequent communications with management.

In a nutshell, my wife and I went to dinner with our friends [another couple] and all of us disliked EVERY COURSE of food. Nothing was even close to appealing except the tea cookies that came with one of the dessert courses. For over $1400 for the four of us without any alcohol, this is simply unacceptable. Please bear in mind that we frequent Michelin starred restaurants and understand how great food tastes [we had been at the French Laundry the night before which was tremendous and also Epicure in Paris three weeks earlier which was also marvelous - as any establishment with THREE Michelin stars should be]. The fact that not one of us liked any of the numerous courses of food is almost hard for us to believe and we left the restaurant in shock that we all felt the same way.

After reflecting on our evening, I had my travel concierge reach out to the restaurant’s management. Meadowood’s assistant director, Chitra Samanta, proceeded to tell him that my group was intoxicated and argued with each other outside. Yes, you are reading this correctly - instead of addressing the bad food - they went after us personally. After some simply questions from my concierge, Chitra admitted that her staff said we had not had any alcohol with our meal, that they had not addressed the alleged intoxication with us, and that we had not made any staff or restaurant guests uncomfortable. They just “felt that way” - basically trying to cover up/divert from the issue at hand.

At this point, I called Chitra and spoke with her myself. I calmly relayed our disappointment and addressed each of their unfounded issues with our party [it is ridiculous that we were put in this situation in the first place when it was a problem with the food!]. She agreed to speak with the head chef and restaurant director about what she called “your side of the story.” A few hours later I received an email [not even a phone call] stating that they were not going to do anything about our negative experience. Instead, the email insituated that our palettes were not up to par with their food!! Unbelievable!

It is clear to me that Meadowood cares more about keeping our money than doing ANYTHING to resolve this horrible situation. They insulted our characters with baseless claims of intoxication and poor behavior, which are totally false. FOOD LOVERS BEWARE! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AT MEADOWOOD!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80845a0cff5dcc35:0x461758da6096d1c9< /GmapID></record>

This was my first Michelin 3 star experience, and the dinner was really good overall.

After a few amuse bouches, our meal started with surf clam (gwai fei pong at Chinese restaurants) with avocado and lardo. I loved the flavor combination as avocado and lardo added a nice richness to the clam. My only complaint about this dish is that the surf clam was minced up. I really think it would've been more interesting if the clam meat was cut into large, thin slices, because the surf clam's natural firm texture would've created a nice contrast with the softer avocado and lardo.

The little mini brioche that accompanied the clam was also pretty fantastic. It had a rich and buttery flavor, but it was still soft and fluffy. Mmmm so good.

My favorite dish of the night was the abalone on smoked peppers and eggplant. The abalone was perfectly tender and not rubbery at all. There was no hint of fishiness, and its delicate sweetness was complimented by the fragrant smoke in the peppers, eggplant, and brothy sauce. I really enjoyed the execution of the dish as well. The crisp sides of the abalone with the soft eggplant and runny sauce created really deep layers of textures. I kinda wish the dinner was just multiple servings of this course.

The poultry and vegetable broth was also surprisingly good. While some thought it was too salty, I liked its boldness, and it had a strong umami flavor. The vegetables gave it a balanced sweetness, but I'm not sure if the bee resin did anything. I've never had bee resin before, so I wasn't sure what to look for. What would really take this broth to the next level would be a little ginseng. Maybe it's my Chinese taste buds, but I think just a hint of ginseng bitterness would've added some more complexity and balance to the broth. Regardless, it was still really tasty.

I think the only other memorable dish was the brillat savarin cheese, which was the last of the savory courses. It's very rich, creamy, savory, slightly salty, but not very sour which I liked. I can't say I cared that much about the handmade rye bread (Tartine's country loaf tastes better), but the cheese was delicious.

The rest of the dinner was either weird or underwhelming. There was this strange cereal dish in the middle of the meal that felt out of place. It was various grains in Oaxacan corn flavored milk. Maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough to appreciate its inclusion, but I didn't like it. The pork collar and squab courses also didn't feel very special. They were served with their typical complimentary fruits like figs and berries. I thought the seafood courses were way more delicious and creative.

While not everything was perfect, there were some very memorable courses that made the experience worthwhile. Yay Meadowood.</text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Meadowood is a luxury hotel near the Napa Valley, and The Restaurant is the restaurant of this hotel. Chef Christopher Kostow specializes in California cuisine. He combines creativity and ingredients to showcase the freshness of the season's ingredients and his ingenuity.
Some people think that Meadowood is one of the most worthy of Michelin's three-star restaurant. The environment and the dishes complement each other. The chic of the utensils adds a bit of history to the dishes. Tasting Menu is priced at $330.

(Original)
Meadowood本是一家靠近Napa Valley的豪华酒店，而The Restaurant便是这家酒店的餐厅。主厨Christopher Kostow格外擅长加州料理，他将创意与食材完美结合，既呈现出了当季食材的鲜美也显现出他极具风范的巧思。
有人认为Meadowood是最值得一试米其林三星餐厅之一，环境与菜品相辅相成，器皿的别致更是为菜色增添了几分来自历史的厚重。Tasting Menu价格为$330。<//Text>< Time>

<Text>BEWARE of a recruiter by the name of Farrell Pompa! She sent me to a client location, and lied about being provided with the necessary equipment needed to perform the job task. 2 weeks in, and I still didn't have the proper equipment stated during the hiring process. She didn't even tell me about the client giving us a day off, after I spent 1 1/2 hours driving to the location. And STILL 4 YEARS LATER! I'm  being penalized for it. Whatever she wrote in my candidate file, is preventing me from getting a job from any aerotek. After COVID, and many clients needing workers, you would think that they would try to staff as many people as they can. After multiple calls, and interviews, I still have to explain myself for what she wrote in my file. I wonder what would the California EDD office have to say about Aerotek denying people jobs, when they are willing/able to work. DISGRACEFUL!</Text>< pictures>

<Review>I agree with Intidada's review...this staffing agency does not care about employees and they aren't a good resource for medical office work. My recruiter actually lied to me about a job. It was supposed to be a 6 month contract working remotely, when in fact it was only 2 months remote and the commute was very long from where I live. When I called her out on it she dropped me as an applicant. Before that she had threatened to CANCEL an interview when I criticized the way things were being handled. Also, it is nearly impossibly to contact many of their field offices.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
They care more about their contracts than they do the Employees, when an Employee is treated unfairly they rather remove the Employee than correct the situation so they don’t loose the contract, sad but true, Employees are nothing but a number to them.

I heard that their top recruiter even said to one of the shift leads whoever wanted to get unemployment let me know SO WE CAN FINISH THEM.

I laughed at that because unemployment is a worker’s right to get if he becomes unemployed.

They really need to check their main top recruiter.< /Review>

these guys have to be the worst agency in history. twice i have worked for them. and twice they have placed me at underneath the barrel companies. stop working with startups! they are STARTUPS! they have absolutely no idea what they are doing! you are wasting good talent by throwing people under the bus! they dont return emails they dont return calls. anyone looking to break into the aerospace industry, please. dont accept any positions with these people. you will get thrown on third shift somewhere in the desert for 15$ an hour 7 days a week.</text>

< Review>
The recruiters of this company would like to just get your resume and have all your references to ask/search about you but nothing happens after all. No job interview, No job open position to be offered to you. JUST WASTING YOUR TIME AND YOUR REFERENCES. Also, they do not answer your follow up emails and phones after a while.<//Review>

Appointments are required, but it's hard to set one since they don't answer their phones.  Bad experience overall with their tech support, as well.</text>

<Text>Apparently they don't know how to do their job because they stop answering phones and replying to emails if you don't get the job. Also weren't very helpful when it came to preparing to meet their client. They make you send in your resume and idk what they do to it, but I had it perfectly laid out only to see it completely messed up when they sent it to their client.<//Text>< Pics>

I have three experience with them. They care only until they think you have a chance to be hired. If the potential employer don't choose you (doesn't matter  if before or after a face to face interview), they won't let you know!!! Just stop to communicate with you. All experience were the same.<//text>

<response>None</response><rating>5</rating><Text>I worked for Aerotek going on 3 years, my first recruiter working out of Aerotek in City of Industry, placed me at a company called Ceilings Plus.  My recruiter's name for that location was Aileen a young lady who's a very caring individual, with anybody she dealt with. I personally believe she will go a long way in this life.
One month later I was placed at Principal Plastics a small family-owned business in Gardena, California by Araceli Delgadillo of Aerotek of Torrance. Being a principal Plastics was another story, there were three employees there of my own Mexican race who were probably the ones responsible for giving the name treachery its meaning! Now don't get me wrong, I never said these three were lazy they worked hard,  we just didn't get along.
And the majority of employees at Principle Plastics were excellent people especially the seamstress Dept. And so were the men & women of shipping, who were led by two supervisors of high quality, one of them is Blanca.
And last but definitely not the least my boss; Ramon very good man, like myself ex-army. So mellow I could not have ever imagined him ever being a drill sergeant & actually I don't know if he ever was.
I wonder how Luna is doing talk about a beautiful dog and as mellow as her master.
Truth be told I do miss this place very much, and I thank Aerotek Torrance for my experience there.
Once leaving Aerotek I went back to work for Dov Charney La Apparel formally American Apparel after 3 days of being there Ernie a supervisor for maintenance cause me to get (breaking my scapula) hurt. Preparation for my surgery is now underway but when I heal I plan to go back to Aerotek, the men & women staffing Aerotek are of excellent quality and they live and work by their moto; there people are everything!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

You're just another number to them. I was placed on a temp assignment that displayed gross favoritism and extremely poor management and when I asked for assistance in reassignment, they directed me to the Aerotek website to search for jobs on my own. They simply didn't care and you can never get anyone on the phone. Had to call for  hours to get a single recruiter on the line. A horrible mess of an agency.<//review>

After i requested a raise, took about a month to see it.  I tried calling the phone will ring for ever.  Have been calling for about a week and NO ONE will pick up.  Not only that but 5 of the employees that i used to stay in contact refuse to respond to my emails and calls after the raise.  Most unprofessional consulting firm to work for!  Don't even try.  They will make 100% on top of you (for processing your payroll which is mostly computerized and that's all!!!), stiff the client with an exorbitant bill and refuse to answer you after you negotiate a raise which takes ALOT of effort!
I will be making complaints on LinkedIn, GlassDoors, Indeed and other websites regarding this company's unprofessional,  unethical, nefarious  behavior.<//Text><user_id>106612022575917039462</user_id>< pictures>

I have yet to get fully paid. Its been a whole month! Alot of lies, misdirection, and a whole lot of stress. They tell you anything to get you off the phone. I needed money to survive. That's why I applied. I was literally starving i got this job so I could eat! If you have kids don't work with them your kids will STARVE! its soo  much more, but to save time if you have classes that need to be paid off, hygiene products, money for bills this is not that job! Im soo serious!<//review>

The recruiter name araceli is very rude and unprofessional. She cursed while interviewing me and confessed that majority of the jobs want Mexicans only. I'm not gonna get deep into details because I don't wanna bash her online but my advice to anyone who "doesn't look Mexican" don't apply with aerotek, atleast not at this location because you'll be wasting your time while the people who "look mexican" start work the next day</Review>

<Review>They called me offered me a job . They just told me they will call me back. It's been a week and I said no to other job offers because the one this company offered was better and better pay. But never did they email me or call me or anything . I had to call 2 days later. And the same thing . Never called me back. They dont care if they help u get a job . If they dont call and send u to work that same day dont expect anything from them . I worked for this company before and it took almost 3 weeks to get paid by them. They never return emails . And just forward calls around and laugh about it</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) They have only answered me once and I call several times in the day and they never answer me. Call at the time I call, they don't answer so they have receptionists if they never answer 😡

<Text>Absolutely the worst wings and french fries my family has ever eaten. The boneless wings were soggy and tasted like frozen wings.  I had little to no sauce on my bone-in wings.  The french fries were soggy and the onion rings were burnt.  The cashier couldn’t remember a thing I said on the first try.  I had to repeat myself on everything I ordered.< /Text>< Rating>

My family and I had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant. The customer service was incredible and the food was delicious! The restaurant is really nice, however they currently only have take out and delivery due to the pandemic. We will definitely be back< /review>

The wings are not good at all,very dry. We could not finish them because they were so dry. And the favors, wow no very nasty. The only reason I gave them a one is because of the girl that had taken are order was very nice.</text>

Honestly the steak fries and nachos are amazing. But sadly I cannot say the same for their wings. Little bland, dry, and not the best looking wings I've had in a long minute. Beer is served here and a ton of televisions around the place, probably the BWW of the area. They do have a pretty cute logo too and a roll of towels on each table so you can stay spotless.< /Text>

Me and my best friend went to Chiki Chiki Wings and sports yesterday on April 8TH.
The food I ordered was horrible. I paid $41.00 dollars for teriyaki wings that were un--eatable , due to being over cooked; the Steak fries were not steak fries instead they were regular, hard and cold; plus the meal was missing two ingredients that came on the platter of the order. Unfortunately I believe it was due to the fact that we were black; reason all the person's that were dining were Hispanic's.
The only good experience I did received was from the waitress who took my order; she was kind and considerate

Outside is rough but we were coaxed in by the 4.3 star rating to check it out. Upon coming in, it seemed nicer than the outside with the exception of some loud hood music playing from the kitchen which overpowered the dining area and sports TVs.

The girl who greeted us was wearing a beenie cap looking blazed af. Next, we sampled 2 of their sauces. Mild and hot Buffalo which both tasted like chef boyardee tomato sauce. We opted out of the 20 piece to give the lemon pepper and pineapple a shot.  Should have never ate here.

When the wings came out they looked like Tyson freezer section wings and tasted, smelled bad. We ate half of our fries which were over seasoned and left 8 out of 10 wings. This place is ratchet af. 🤮< /review>< Pictures>

The wings are delicious! And they have great prices. place to hang out and watch the game with friends. The only thing that was a bummer was the .75 charge if I used my card instead of cash. I had the zucchini, fries, and mozzarilla sticks also. Quality food and great customer service< /review>

Very Clean, Food Was Good, Really Liked the TV displays.

Service could of been better but just seemed like the girl in the front needed help. She was doing multiple positions.

<Text>Clean place & staff seemed nice enough. They could really use some vegetarian options. Roasted cauliflower with wing sauce would be great, or keep some veggie wings (or burger) in the freezer. They don't have an IPA!? Nothing local. Domestic beers, and their imports were all Mexican. Tons of TVs and cheap cover for the UFC fight!</Text>< response>

First of all the hamburger was hard and not good at all hamburger meat was defenetly old...Not worth 10 dollars...Boneless wings were ok but they were chewy. The only good part about this meal was the fries. Defenetly won't come back not worth the 60 dollars we spend.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Very warm inside with little ventilation other than fans on the table. After being outside on these hot days walking in to rest and eat was not a good experience.
Ordered chicken tenders and they were not good. Some frozen food set up to warm when ordered. The battered outside was horrible,  I couldn't even separate the chicken from the batter.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Cons:
1.no one answers the phone when trying to order!😤
2. short hours open
3.its hidden location in a questionable area.
4. outter traffic view presentation lacks

Pros:
1. The inside of this place is unexpectedly NICE!
2. ALL sports were on TV (I'm a hockey person so that was nice)
3. Prices are fair
4. Portions are fair.
5. Good variety of wing flavors are available.
6. Polite waitresses/ cashiers
7. CLEAN ALL AROUND 👏👏
8. foosball tables inside!

Personal intake:
We LOVE the steak fries!! The fies in general are delicious!! The cashiers/waitresses could use a more "yay" tone &uniform. I tried the lemon pepper and bbq wings, they were just okay unfortunately. Montzerella sticks were on point. Free refils on soda is a plus, beer selection is good. And in general I think the location does not do this place justice or exposure it deserves.

AND PLEASE ANSWER THE PHONE!! I hate waiting so I'm the type that calls to order ahead of time. And not answering just makes a hungry person pissy. After my 5th try I get thro, not cool.< /Review>< pictures>

Very much wanted to enjoy this food. I had an Order of 10 bone in wings with 2 sauce flavors. The sauces tasted lazy and they were poured on extremely over cooked wings. I guess the burned food explains the long wait time.</Text>

<Text>Wings had a funny smell. They had a frozen taste. The fries were seasoned better than the wings were. The mango habanero sauce was not good. The Asian kick sauce was good. The ranch dressing was like a paste. I had to use a fork to spread it on the wings. The service was good unfortunately the wings were not!👎👎</Text>< Pics>

The atmosphere is really. I wasn't crazy about their chicken wings. The sauces we're just okay. The chicken wings had no seasoning; prior to the sauces being slathered on. Can't tell you about the rest of the menu. I only ordered the ten piece wings. The Asian sauce was good. I also got honey barbecue. Didn't care for the barbecue sauce. Customer service was great. Very friendly staff, The Women's bathroom was very clean.< /review>

The ranch cups are very tiny and not enough for your orders, if you want more ranch you have to pay for it  $ .80 cents per tiny cup of ranch, when  I received my order always is incomplete and I have to remind them what is left and they looks mad when you let them know, the wings  are getting worse every time I go:  oily, less flavors, very  dry, bad flavor, for all this and more I didn't enjoy eating inside the last time,

Bone in garlic parm wings are delicious. Ranch is great. I’m usually skeptical about the ranch at some places , this one goes great with the wings. The fries are good, and well seasoned. They have AC. You can play foosball and they do serve alcohol.</text>

This place use to be good when the old owners were in charge. With the new owners the food isn’t as good as it use to be. The chicken tenders are super oily and when you add flavor they only put a little bit so you taste more oil than anything. To top it off they give you the tiniest cup of ranch I’ve ever seen, it’s not even enough for 2 wings. The fries are still good, and probably the only thing worth buying from here, although sometimes they are over cooked and oily but that’s rare. Oh and let’s not forget the Cowboy fans who don’t let you in and fill up the whole parking lot.

Save yourself the trip and go to wing stop or Buffalo Wild Wings if you want some decent wings, this place isn’t worth your time or money. It definitely needs to change owners again.</Text>

The wings were alright, not the best I've ever had. The onion rings were not very good because they were so saturated in grease and for the quality of food it is very over priced.</text>

<Review>Little known spot for delicious wings and things. There is hardly ever a wait and the food always comes out like they take their time making it. Not like other busier places like Wingstop or BWW, where it takes forever to get your food and have to wait a long time to be seated. Their sauces are all pretty good, and if you like spicy, some of them are super hot. Overall a hole in the wall legit lacking the clientele it deserves.< /Review><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

< Review>
Chicki Chicki opens at 4 pm. I don't know too many places that open at 4 pm, atleast not wing places. One one hand, the lemon pepper wings were delicious, on the other hand their mild wings were flat out terrible. I couldn't get enough of their lemon pepper, it was mostly a dry rub but did have a little wet rub to it. The mild sauce tasted more like a mix of spicy ketchup and spicy barbecue. I'm a big guy and I seldom leave food on my plate but I had to leave the mild wings, it was that bad.

I had french fries with my order and they were hot,crispy and really well seasoned. With an order of wings I would definitely welcome a larger side of ranch but that's just me. The young lady at the counter was super friendly despite being the only person working the register and dining room. I can definitely see myself coming back for more lemon pepper wings and French fries.

The dining room was nice and spacious and relatively clean. Again, the young lady working the register was the only person working the front so I'm cutting her some slack. There were plenty of tables and plenty of TV's but the volume wasn't overpowering.  Also, their prices are a bit better than most other wing places. I just wish they opened earlier than 4pm Monday through Friday.<//Review>

<review>Was good until some new stuff are too stuck up, even sat down for a over an hour and not once were we checked up on for anything. Old staff was friendly and considerate. Also it's slow in here very little people so it's not busy where we cannot be helped. Update of next month. Now the owner decided to rid of the 6dollar buckets for budlight due to some idiots fighting so now old customers pay for it? Will not return again.< /review>< pictures>

Waitress was rude when she took the order. It took them about 30mins to bring out our food, place wasn't busy. When asked for refills she made wait and went to the kitchen and sent someone else. I been coming to this place for a quite some time and never had any problems untill today. Also menu and prices have changed. Not coming back.</Text>

Place is too small and these small businesses next to it suffer because when football season starts they take up all the parking.<//Review>

If this place wasn't so pricey and served more diverse alcohol other than beer, I would give it 5 stars. However, they charge for jus about everything, even 75 cent to use your Visa card. I can see debt card fee but credit? Anyhow, my rating is based on comparison to Buffalo Wild Wings, wings stop and Lord of the Wings. There wings here were awesome. Nice size wing with plenty of flavor. Of course, they charge you for extra dipping sauces, but there ranch was no hidden valley lol. It was good as well, not thin or watered down. I would definitely come again especially during game (baseball/football) nights. Plenty of Tvs to watch whatever sport interests you.<//review>

Personally my dine in experiences have been splendid with service and food being parallel in quality. Just recently I ordered delivery and I wasn't really happy with the turnout . Thinking the place opened at 10:00 a.m I went there to find out they open at 12:00 pm but they start doing deliveries at 11:00 so I called and set my order at 11:20 a.m and food was delivered just five mins before 1:00 p.m . "To the owners of the place". If you guys aren't truly committed to good service in delivery and or are unable to provide such an awesome service similar to dining in . Then you shal no longer provide that service .It only hurts your reputation and good quality food.

<Review>The service here is extremely rude  The girls there couldn't count the money correctly took about 30 minutes for two burgers when I went to ask about how much  longer very politely I got a very bad look from the cook and felt like he messed with our burgers. The girl who served as started laughing as we bit into it we didn't finish the burgers and I'm going to call the city and get a health inspector in there.</Review>< pictures>

My man is big on wings and I'm not a fan of those big franchise wing spots. After looking at the reviews for this place I convinced my boyfriend to give it a try. I must say these are by far the best wings I've ever had. I would have given them five stars but they did get my order wrong. I additionally ordered carne asada nachos and they gave me Carne asada fries. They were very good but I was looking forward to my nachos.<//Text>

This place is GREAT! I was in the mood for some wings and I wanted to watch the UFC fights so I came here on a Saturday and I was blown away with the ambiance, the service, the food, and the cleanliness of the restaurant. I highly recommend this restaurant.<//Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) If you are going to eat there, do not take a $ 100 dollar bill to pay $ 12 because they will not serve you, you have to consume more or they will not sell you anything. I wanted to pay three coffees and they did not sell them for not bringing change unfortunately it was the only thing I had so I will not return.

(Original)
Si vas a comer ahi , no lleves un billete de$ 100 dolares para pagar $12 porque no te van atender ,tienes que consumir mas o no te venden nada .quise pagar tres cervesas y no me las vendieron por no traer cambio desgraciadamente era lo unico que tenia asi que no regresare.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Their desserts are not very sweet and flavorful. The flavor is very mild unlike other desserts I have tried in different places. If you want sweet and strong flavors I wouldn’t go here. Their service was very good. People who work there are very friendly.<//Review>

This place is a gem.  As you enter the front door, immediately the alluring scent of freshly baked bread envelopes you in happiness. Today is beginning of Persian new year. The glass cases are filled with delicious sweets. I frequent every few weeks for the barbarian bread. It’s heavenly.</text>

AMAZING cafe!!!!  It is owned by an incredibly nice Persian guy named Sam!!!  The pastries are homemade!!!  It is very popular!  Thanks Sam for sharing your culture with us.  We felt your genuine hospitality and felt like we visited another country.  The cream puffs were the best I have ever tasted.  Many people were buying 5 loads of bread each.  They would smell the bread as they got into their cars.  It was so good.  Super yummy Persian tea too!< /text>

Today we tried their Barbari and Sangak but fron the moment I saw the bread it was one of the best persian breads in bay area or maybe US. Staff were friendly too, next time hopefully I'll try their coockies.< /review>

The eggplant dish was awesome! Beware, the red spice powder on the hummus is NOT just some paprika for color - it is deliciously spicy! The "eggs with vegetables" is a very dark spinach flavor, more like a souffle, I didn't much like it.<//Review>

I'm pretty much addicted to the Sangak bread. The reason for just 34 stars is that I prefer the "Special Sangak" which requires being lucky that they have it, or calling in an order. Unfortunately their phone system (cell phone?) is pretty bad and sometimes times they can't hear you. Nice place, nice people, I just wish they'd get a better phone. I note some reviews calling them out for bad service or being rude - something I've never encountered or seen. Sometimes there is a single worker slaving over the oven and trying to help customers at the same time. Have some patience folks. I say "Hi!" and smile, and that's what comes back.

UI upgraded from 4 to 5 stars because since my initial review they have increased production so the Special is almost always available.</text>

I used to be a custmer for this place until one day the owner told me he don't need my money in terms of coins. Honestly, I feel like a homeless or somebody who cannot afford to buy his $3 bread. What a dushbag! Not recommend anybody to visit this place where people did not respect for themselves.< /Review>

< review>
The bread is exactly what you'd expect Sangak to look and taste like.  I'd give it a 5.

The service however is horrible.  It is a bajillion degrees in there due to no AC to speak of and the huge oven running and it being San Jose.

So I usually order and walk out, double check to make sure they know it's my order, and the moment you step out they give your bread to the next person.  You can go back in and they lie to you saying, "oh it's cooking, it will be right out" but that's when they start your batch.

Walk out again to catch a breath of relief, even if it is 90 degrees outside, and your order is given to someone else again, and new lies about how yours will be out any second as they double-check with you, "How many did you want again?  And what kind?" And you watch them start that many again from scratch.< /review>

The owners are extremely rude. This is in regards to the bakery. I would rather pay double the price and support a establishment that understands customer service. Take the service out of the equation the bread was average.</text>

Good sandwiches but I had to return my meals in two different occasions (I been there only 4 times) cause they served the wrong sandwich.< /Text>

We have gotten countless breakfast burritos here. I used to love pre-ordering and pickup on my way out of town. But several months ago I ordered a veggie burrito they gave me a fully loaded MEAT burrito and it was disgusting biting into that. Threw it away and was already on my way and pressed for time, I couldn’t go back even though I was now hungry and missing my breakfast. Frustrated, I called the Deli. They said no worries, we will comp your next burrito. So I went back to redeem about a month later and they didn’t have record and made me wait 30 minutes while they called the manager and the manager had to call the person on staff the day my order got messed up, and then they still wanted to charge me extra for choosing a different burrito that costed a dollar or so more. I found this whole situation frustrating, hence me taking off a few stars. They are expensive but I’m willing to pay the price for a good breakfast burrito, but not if they treat customers like this. I emailed the company many months ago with no response. My husband keeps wanting to go back but I say no way. I like supporting local businesses, but only when their customer care is a positive experience.<//text>

<Review>I like to think of myself as a connoisseur of breakfast burritos.... a burrito bravura if you will... and i have to say that this burrito far exceeded my burrito expectations. Almost makes me sad that my digestion processes will only allow me to retain this deliciousness for 6-12 hours before expulsion. The pickles are the size of enormous cucumbers and the fishy fish tank provides hours of entertainment. 6/5 stars</Review>< Pictures>

The place is really cute and based on the reviews, we thought we'd get some really great food. I had the potato soup, which costs $10, and it was rancid. They gave me a refund, but the sheer fact that a bowl of soup even costs that much in the first place is ridiculous. I expected it to be some seriously gourmet potato soup, and it was absolutely disgusting. The staff tried it too and agreed with me. The staff themselves were great, but I just can't see myself going there again after this experience.</text>

<Text>It was my first time there. I very much enjoyed it. Very friendly people, good menu variety, build your own sandwiches, icecream...and all day breakfast. I had an awesome BLT with avocado. You can eat inside or outside among the redwoods on picnic tables. You can even bring your dog. Very nice quiet setting.<//Text>< Pics>

Even though I was willing to pay for the whole egg... their "policy" prevented them from separating the yolks from the whites for me (siting cost effectiveness).  So... if you have high cholesterol and are in the mood for eggs, do not go to The Palm for breakfast.<//review>

Great lunch spot for your sandwich cravings. They have a coffee bar, serve gelato, smoothies, and have decent snacks and drinks, including local wine by the bottle for take away. Everything is pretty delicious and satisfying. It is a little on the pricy side, the  staff are friendly (they are all pretty young, like highschool/early college age), the service can be slow sometimes, but it's a very popular lunch spot for the nearby businesses and school kids.<//text>

Their sandwiches are a little pricey and have had better elsewhere however they make great smoothies and will go back for those for sure. Cute out of the way with patio and small seating area inside. Nice aquarium with big colorful fish. Next time want to try their breakfast...looks delish.< /Review>

Im of the old school thinking that a customer in the store is more important than one on the phone. Instead of me holding when im there first surely you can ask the call to hold. Maybe im just hangry.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Time>

< Review>
If you need the job done, look no further! Rick is the REAL deal!!. He responded promptly and when I explained my situation, he was compassionate and was up for the challenge. He communicated with me throughout the whole process. Rick served the papers on his 1st attempt. He takes pictures/videos and, as a customer, it gave me peace of mind. And his fees are very reasonable. Give him a call...don't waste your money with anyone else!!!<//Review>

I've used different process servers before, and I can say Rick is a professional through and through. He's got the best rates, works the hardest, is the most responsive, and is the most thorough in his work.

He is NOT the kind of guy who does the bare minimum, gives up at the first sign of difficulty, and collects his check. He will hustle for you. And when it comes to his kind of work, you need people who'll go above and beyond.

I don't normally write reviews, but he's so good that I felt that I owed it to him. Two thumbs up.<//text>

The Sheriff's department was not serving my court ordered temporary restraining order fast enough so I was recommended to contact Rick.  He's professional, well mannered and gets the job done fast.  I hope to never need to hire a process server again but if I do Rick will be the first one I call.</text>

Expert, excellent service! We will gladly reccomend and seek their business again! Rick was thorough with his job and incredibly patient with us, and my mother and I are extremely grateful to him for his help. He's easy to work with and very reasonable, go with him if you need a great process server! We look forward to working with you again Rick, thank you and happy Independence Day!< /review>

If you need papers served, I would highly recommend going with Rick.

I'm dealing with my first small claims case, and I needed my papers served to the defendant. I tried using the sheriffs to serve the papers, but they told me that they tried 3 times, where they heard people inside with the tv on and the dogs barking, but the defendant refused to answer the door. After 2+ weeks, I received documents from the Sheriffs office that they could not serve the papers, due to the defendant being "evasive."

I then reached out to Rick... told him what had occurred and provided him my papers. Soon after he was able to get the job done.

He's fast, efficient, thorough, and most importantly.. He gets the job done! If I ever need this type of service again, I'm not bothering with the sheriffs. I will be going with Rick again.</Review>

When it comes to serving legal documents Rick is the perfect guy! Highly responsive. Handles the job professionally and sends photos on the spot showing the awesome job he does. I highly recommend him. I have tried other servers and no one was able to serve my deceptive partner. He was able to get him and in the right time. If it wasn't for Rick, i would have been still lost. He is always in touch, gives great feedback and you don't have to chase him for the documents or anything, unlike others! Look no more, this is the perfect guy for the job! Especially if you have no time. He would go out of his way to get it done right and save you. A life saver!<//text>

Rick is a class act. He came to the rescue of a good friend of ours, who's husband had been less than civil. Rick showed up to our house. First off he's  exactly what you would imagine a bounty hunter to look like. Rugged, Steady and can handle himself. Our friend just escaped a toxic relationship and was very nervous and fearful about serving her husband. Rick was very empathic towards her and reassured her like he'd been her friend for years. She immediately calmed down and felt 100% better after she handed Rick the paper work. Within a few hours Rick texted us photos of the husband in question reading the paperwork. It was all very quick and effortless. 100%, I will refer Rick for any process work I ever have, or ever hear of anyone needing a delicate matter dealt with effectively.<//text>

I called about 10 process servers in LA who either did not return my call, were too expensive or gave me the brush off. Finally, I found the man to get the job done! Rick was extremely responsive and timely -- and fortunately for me, knew exactly what needed to be done and completed the job quickly. He is very relaxed and professional, which was reassuring after talking to so many folks who couldn't be bothered to return my call much less help me. He communicated with me throughout the process and saved the day! I highly recommend that you hire him.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I 100% recommend LA County Process. The sheriffs made 4 attempts to serve over the course of a week, shortening the amount of time I had left to serve and I needed my papers served as soon as possible. Rick immediately contacted me when I made my enquiry, the very next day he came to pick up my papers and made his first attempt to serve. It took a few times, but Rick is relentless and doesn't give up, when he says he will get it done, believe him. Not only that, he talked me through the next steps of what he was going to do and made recommendations for myself as well as the courthouse impeding closure. He's given me piece of mind and I'm so happy with his service PLUS after care. THANKS RICK!</review>

<review>Reached out to LAC Process for a quote and he contacted me back within 20 minutes. Thoroughly impressed with how quick he got the job done! He did a stake out since it was the only address we had on file and served respondent the same day we hired him. He also sent pictures as proof the respondent was served and filed the proof of service in court the following day. He kept me in the loop and is a true professional. I would definitely recommend his business! You won't be disappointed, excellent customer service and gets the job done in a flash.<//review><gmap_id>0x80c2bf70a421fa01:0x6860e5e888d8bf04</gmap_id>< username>

Excellent service! Rick was a pleasure to work with after a very poor experience using a different local process service company.

I would highly recommend hiring LA County Process to "get your guy". The next time I need to have someone served in the LA County area, I will be calling Rick.< /Text>

I’m a realtor who was sued by the lawyer of a prominent person.  I needed to serve that prominent person as a witness.  They were avoiding service.  After trying various unsuccessful process servers, I found Rick, who made it happen.  Rick has passion for his work and I would recommend him with the highest recommendation.

Highly recommended!  This is your secret weapon for court filings!  Rick can handle any court filing in the county, he knows where to go, gets there in time, and usually texts a photo of conformed copies before mailing the originals back.  Rick has done several last minute court filings, the same day, and goes above and beyond expectations!  One time he got the assignment at 11 a.m., printed the documents for me at Staples and he add exhibit tabs to a large motion filing, and he still made the 4:30 filing deadline.< /review>

I highly recommend LA County Process! Rick works very fast! I reached out to LA County Process on Friday night. Rick responded to my request promptly (within the hour). By Saturday afternoon the person I hired him to find was served! I emailed the documents to him as a PDF attachment.  After a  brief stakeout, he found the person I needed to  be served, sent me a photo of him to confirm his identity, and even sent me a picture of the service! He emailed me the proof of service document I needed for court.

He was very transparent about the cost. There were no surprises when it came time to pay.  I sent him the payment thru Venmo and the process was complete!

If the person you need to serve court documents to is ducking the Sherriff, call Rick at LA County Process! He'll get the job done!<//review>

<text>I’m a realtor who was sued by the lawyer of a prominent person.  I needed to serve that prominent person as a witness.  They were avoiding service.  After trying various unsuccessful process servers, I found Rick, who made it happen.  Rick has passion for his work and I would recommend him with the highest recommendation.

<review>I’m in the process of purchasing a home and requested Emory’s Plumbing & Camera inspection in order to get a better idea of the state of the plumbing of the home I’m buying. However, I was not present at either inspection because I was on the East Coast for work.

Emory Plumbing did what was expected of them; hence, me giving Emory three stars. They conducted an inspection and provided results. However, the manner in which this was conducted and the quality of the report left more to be desired. The visual inspection was completed without any issues. But when it came to the camera inspection, the technician could not complete it because there was no clean out. So, the technician had to come back another day to complete it. Therefore taking more time out of our day. I wonder if this could have been avoided if there were more detailed questions asked of me when I made the appointment and issues like this were anticipated by technicians. Additionally, Emory gives their clients time windows (standard, of course), but having to make another appointment for a house I don’t own was an inconvenience to many more people than just my real estate agent.

Considering that I could not be present for these appointment, it would have been helpful to get a quick phone call from the technician to give me a summary of the state of the plumbing. I did not need a full list but a courtesy call would have been helpful to assuage my concerns about the plumbing of the home I am about to buy. Instead, I had to call multiple times and when told that I would receive a call back, I heard nothing from Emory. When I did speak to someone, it was not even a technician. However, she did have a good grasp of the issues but could not speak to the specific detail of the home’s plumbing. Her customer service the best out of the all the people I dealt with, but it did not come without a bit of prompting on my end.

I received the report 48 hours after the inspection. The report consisted of 1 page just stating the issue and a repair cost estimate. There were no pictures, no detail about the proposed repair for items that were more technical in nature, no explanation of the repair cost estimate nor did they include labor in their estimate. In sum, a substandard product.

I would like to give Emory Plumbing the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps had I been present for the inspections, I would have had a better experience. But when I explained my situation, they did little to address my needs. It does not take much effort to return calls nor to provide a bit more detail in a report. I would recommend that Emory review their inspections reports to provide more detail and be more transparent in their repair estimates and to include an estimate on labor costs. Additionally, I would recommend that Emory improve their customer service procedures to include a follow up with their clients.< /review>< username>

< Review>
I had a really good experience with this company. I was trying to save money on getting a new toilet installed. They were the best price I found after calling 4 other companies. But wait there's more. With a good price also came good service! Which is kinda hard to find. The service technician didn't drag out the appointment, he was very informative, and left my bathroom better than he found it. I definitely will be using them again!!!!!!!</Review>

We have used Emory before after our previous plumbing company just started not responding and not showing up.  They were very responsive from the get-go. On this go-around, we needed our tankless water heater serviced.  The plumber was extremely friendly, got the job done and explained the process and results to my wife thoroughly.  She actually commented that she's never had such a good experience with a plumber.  We will continue to use Emory for our plumbing needs.</Review>

Wow!  What a fantastic experience!  I called Emory and they showed up within 15 minutes. Both Carlos and his partner were extremely polite and courteous.  They took care of the problem within minutes, explained the issue, and made sure the bathroom and their work area was spotlessly clean before they left.

I cannot say enough about how impressed I am with Emory Plumbing.  Although I hope not to have any future plumbing issues, if I ever do I will not hesitate to contact Emory.<//Review>

We busted our main water line from the street over the weekend and called Emory based on positive past experience replacing our gas lines. On Saturday evening, Jose was on site within 30 minutes to assess the situation. He had to pick up some extra parts and returned to complete the job to restore our water in under two hours from when we called. Great turnaround time, up front about costs, and great service. We felt comfortable with Emory despite what could have been a crisis over the weekend. Look forward to working together in the future.<//text>

I needed repair fast and Emory came to the rescue quickly and professionally. The office scheduled the appointment with ease. The same day service promptly came at the expected time. Carlos inspected the problem and gave suggestions for the possible complications that might occur. Either way with confidence he reassured me he could complete the job and he did! Carlos got right to work and within a short time finished the work. He cleaned up with a smile all in 30 minutes or less.  Job well done and overall great experience. Thank you Emory.< /Text>

<text>The water heater in our rental unit died leaving our tenant without hot water.  We called Emory Plumbing in the morning, were quoted a fair price, and they replaced the water heater before the end of the day.  They handled everything for us including contacting our tenant to confirm the schedule.  As an out-of-town landlord, I highly value their exceptional customer service and fast response.  The problem was fixed and our tenant was happy.  Thank you Emory Plumbing for a job well done.  We will continue to rely on your company as our go-to partner for plumbing related needs.<//text></record>

<Review>I've used Emory Plumbing 3 times in the last year to clear clogged drains and replace old rusty pipes.  I can highly recommend them and will continue to use them when I have plumbing needs.  I especially appreciate the way Carlos took care of the problems and communicated with the cause of the problem.  They responded quickly, effectively, and are reasonably priced.</Review><rating>5<//rating></record>

<text>Great Service.  I had Emory come to my home to disconnect an exterior gas line going to a grill.  They were very professional, completed the work in a timely way, and configured the gas line and capped it so that I has easier access for future use.   Highly recommend this local company in Mission Valley.

I cannot rave enough about the incredible service I received from this company and its individual employees.   They came after hours and once we realized the wrong size tank was delivered Francisco came the next morning at 6:30 AM once the warehouse had opened to install immediately so my family could have hot water to begin the workday. They went above and beyond the best service possible and I have already referred them to several of my friends. My husband is a real estate agent  and he has even added them to his “go to” directory for all home repairs. Look no further, everything you need is all with Emory plumbing.<//text>

<text>Emory Plumbing was referred to me by a family member who has used their services off an on for many years with great results.  They lived up to their reputation with my first service call.  After two handyman had tried to troubleshoot a malfunctioning shower and advised I'd probably have to rip out the handle mechanism by making a hole in the wall, I called Emory for a third opinion.  Their plumber showed up on time and did not leave until he figured out what was wrong and fixed it. (..and it did not require making a hole in the wall but instead was a faulty part).   I was very pleased with their professionalism and expertise and won't hesitate to call Emory first next time.</text></record>

Very gracious after I bungled our appointment.  Had a bad clog in a rental property at the start of a week-end and my tenants were anxious to have service ASAP.  Called several plumbers.  Booked Emory for a Monday appointment, but then got a response from a plumber able to respond ASAP, so I went with him.

Unfortunately, I completely forgot about having made a Monday appointment with Emory.  On the Monday of the scheduled visit, they called to confirm the appointment.  Luckily I was able to take the call right away and tell them I already had the service performed and was very sorry I neglected to cancel our appointment.

The Emory rep. I spoke with was very gracious which made me feel less like an idiot for failing to cancel the appointment.  I understand time is money in a small business and customers who don't keep appointments can be costly and very annoying.  I felt terrible about my oversight, but was quite relieved that my error was caught before they arrived for the service and that they were more than professional in the face of my error.

Plumbing urgencies can be very stressful:  Not only is it important for a plumber to be able to quickly and competently solve the technical problem, good ones understand the anxiety of their customers and can successfully relieve the stress.</Review>

We tried everything to unclog our sink before we called Emory. Not only was our kitchen sink unclogged within an hour, but the technician also gave us some really great tips on how to dry out and keep the area under the sink from molding.< /text>

I would like you to consider to take your review down as it is pretty untruthful. We came out to service you last Friday with a technician who has 7 years of tankless experience (just because he is young that does not make him incompetent). He completed some research and I, personally, called you on Monday to check in. We did have a discussion about your PRV and you informed me that it was fairly new and that the tech had mentioned some other options. I told you, no problem, I would get with the tech and complete more research and call you back as soon as I had further quotes. You called for me today, not even 24 hours later, in which, my apologies, I was out in the field for most of the day, and, apparently weren\'t satisfied that I wasn\'t able to call you until later in the afternoon. Please understand, it will take more than the one day, you allowed for, to complete the necessary research for a problem that you have had for quite some time that several other plumbers have also not been able to identify and fix. Also, we do not appreciate you making it seem like our estimates are out of line. Pressure issues are often the main cause of water hammering. You just happened to have a 2" PRV, which, is an abnormally large and pricey valve that typically range from $500-600.00 prior to any industry mark up. Please feel free to google that to verify my information. Please reach out to our office if you are interested in receiving those other quotes, but, at this moment in time all research on your project will be stopped until we hear from you.\n\nIn the highest regards,'}</response><time>1551226187054< /time><gmap_id>0x80deaad13bd9ff21:0x51a1d70e76bfb14e<//gmap_id>< text>
Disappointed - Look out...plumbers and used car salesmen. Most plumbers are looking for easy quick jobs to make a fast buck (and over charge).

Tried 3 different plumbers do diagnose and fix a water hammering problem in a business with a 90 gallon tank and tankless unit.

EMORY advertised as being a commercial plumber. I requested a seasoned professional in hopes of getting someone who's been around. Instead a got a young guy who vaguely appeared to know what he was talking about. He did diagnosed the problem and discussed a couple ways to fix the problem. Stated he would forward a quote with pricing per each fix option.

I got a phone call from the receptionist with a $1000 quote for a fix we had not discussed. She stated the tech spoke with co workers who made the suggestion on the fix. What they suggested replacing was a virtually new regulator. No one asked me how old the regulator was or if it had been replaced.

This is the problem I had with the previous two plumbing companies...suggesting replacing/installing  random parts for big $$$$.

To make matters worse, made two phone calls in an attempt to speak with the tech...no return call. Requested a manager give me a call back...no return call.

It appears, if you need a new hot water tank, a leaky faucet or something basic, you'll be ok with EMORY. But if it's anything complex, make sure you get at least 3 quotes.<//text>

I cannot say enough great things about this company! I drive by their location every day from work and finally had a reason to call. The dispatchers were courteous and efficient. I was given a window between 12-2 and Brandon was at my house at 12:15 with a courtesy call. All my drains had overflowed, I had raw sewage all over the floor. The technicians worked tirelessly over a period of two hours snaking, cleaning, and hydrojetting (didn't know this even existed) my lines. They came out for 96/hr which I thought was extremely fair with an additional (slightly more expensive) charge for the jetting. I will definitely use this company again and recommend them to anyone. Thank you Emory!< /text>

We discovered a bug in our IT that was causing calls to be dropped and have since been able to fix the issue. If you ever have an additional problem we would love to help you take care of the problem and be reviewed based off our plumbing work instead of technical difficulties. Best of luck!\n\nIn the highest regards,'}<//Resp>< Pictures>

The fragrance always attracts me from far.  The taste never fail.  It's enjoyable to sit outside and have a double burger with milk shake in hand! It's okay to spoil myself once a while! Life is good!<//review>

<Text>You know what you get at In-N-Out but this place is still delivering quality food for an amazing price. I may suggest that you get grilled onions instead as they usually give you an entire raw onion half. Grilled is way better and you still have the fresh raw tomato and lettuce to balance your burger!<//Text><Rate>4<//Rate><Resp>None< /Resp><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMalMy9yd1T7LF5kCVWyu5N2mJ8cCCxwz2-RpqN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics></record>

<Review>There is always a line of cars now in the COVID-19 season, you know it is a favorite eatery. I went there, not many times because I hate the line, because the burger is so tasty that it is different from all other big fast food chains. You know it immediately even before you enter the place since your nose detect it and the heart of your stomach wants it. Hard to describe but believe me, people don’t do lines for nothing here in LA, a capital of all foods from around the world!<//Review>< Pictures>

Tight location in Westwood Village. Challenging at first in finding the drive through. But, still the great taste of an In N Out Burger you expect.< /text>

Still cannot get over how perfect their burgers are. Toasted bun, crispy lettuce, crunchy pickles and patties are just the right size. Fries could be a bit more cooked but when covered with animal style, it’s all good. Also love their small size drinks. The perfect fast food experience< /review>

8 February 2021: I love the Burgers, but I do not like the fries that much.  The best fries ever is an Israeli Jewish fast food restaurant in the city of Burbank, name: Tel Aviv.

The second best fries is Red Robins, large wide seasoned fries.  In and Out burgers get 5 stars, fries 2 stars, but this is just my opinion and the famous slogan is "Opinions are like butt holes, everybody has one."<//review>

This In N Out is closest to where I live but the trick with the Drive thru is finding the end of the line or the entrance (alley next to Fat Sal's) if you've never been before. Often the line goes around the corner on Waybern so heads up.

I love the shakes, obviously love the burgers and my go to order is a 3x3 with whole grilled onion and well done(extra crispy) french fries animal style!

<text>This place serves the best vegan burgers with the friendliest service every single time. I have never been disappointed. I wish they had more locations but they are worth the drive!!! The Sriracha aioli is amazing on the tots or fries! And their shakes are delicious!!!  The only thing that could make this place even better is yellow chillies for that bit of spice with our .< /text>< pics>

The people taking my order were very efficient and friendly. I got my food right away and everything was correct.

I would defiantly recommend coming here. So good!<//text>< pictures>

Don't let people from LA trick you into thinking the food here is good. The meat is tasteless and overcooked. They only eat here because it's cheap. Any fast food tastes better.< /Text>

I used to work in Westwood right behind In-N-Out so whenever I’m back I stop here. Burgers are good for what they serve. Fries are only good if you get animal style.

You get what you pay for to be honest. However pretty decent. Staff are always friendly and work hard.

Thanks In-N-Out for always providing excellent service!</review>

<Date>1602988875221</Date><Text>Never been so offended by a restaurant. Unfortunately all it takes to not have your order taken at an establishment as an African American male is to have a caucasian male accuse you of cutting in line with no proof or witnesses. Apparently their words carry just THAT much more weight. Not only will I not be coming to this location but I won't be giving this company any more of my money from here on out. Have loved the burgers for decades but cannot bring myself to spend another dollar with a company that could condone such behavior.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2bc847ebd9929:0x84c4fbfd2dbf86e2</Gmap_id>< username>

Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to the first ever Dom-In-Out (TM, copyright, patent pending) meal. We have replaced the buns on the Double Double with slices from a Dominos thin crust pepperoni and jalapeno pizza, making it perfect for all you health-conscious carb counters. I have included step-by-step instructions and photos to help you create this glorious masterpiece.

Step 1: Purchase Double Doubles
Step 2: Purchase Domino thin crust pepperoni/jalapeno pizza
Step 3: Remove buns from Double Doubles
Step 4: Apply extra sauce to hamburger
Step 5: Place pizza slices (pepperoni facing in) where hamburger buns used to be.

Yum.</Text>

The burger bun was soggy, the pickle was stringy and no tomato.
Also - the french fries were burnt  and in small tiny pieces.
It was the worst meal I have ever  purchased!<//text>

<text>It’s an average sized In N Out, serving average In N Out burgers.

But I would absolutely kill for an average In N Our burger now that I’m in an area without any In N Outs!

Good quality is amazing for the price. Buns toasty, meat freshly made on the day itself. Any special requests are easily accepted without fuss.
I hear Animal Style burgers are the thing nowadays. Mustard sauce added to the buns and fried for a longer time

Service is alright I guess, food was made in an acceptable time.

5/5 recommended!!</text>< pictures>

<Text>This place is waaay over estimated! The burger was fine, but the fries were horrible. And on top of it, this place was PACKED! I waited 45 min for my food, and probably there were 20 people in line in front of me and 30 behind me. I thought they are giving something for free. It was my first time at in-n-out so I decided to wait. After waiting for so long and after getting my food, I was very disappointed... burger shack and many other places are way better then this...</Text><time>1552278301050</time><Rate>2</Rate>< Response>

Great service like usual ~ they are also quick to place your order. Usually long drive through lanes, but going inside seems like a shorter wait time< /Text>

< review>
When I first come to LA, I didn't know about In-N-Out burger and didn't come here.  But everyone says this is MUST-GO place when I visit California, so on my next trip to LA, I came here with my family and order hamburger and french fries.  I normally don't eat hamburger, but it was soooooooo food!. It was just hamburger and nothing special, but it was very tasty and I and my family eat at least one meal at the In-N-Out burger every time when we visit LA.  I wish they make a franchise nationwide.<//review>

Everyone I could see was masked and gloved. Order taker out in the line stayed minimum six feet from cars. Line still moving just fine. And the cheeseburger was even better than normal. Maybe it's just been a while, since the lines of late have been impossible.< /Text>

This location is the classic In-N-Out burger joint. Very neat and clean inside despite the busy crowds always streaming in.

Customer service was great. Price was fair. And the Burgers are incredible. In-n-Out is also doing a wonderful initiative to stop human trafficking in the community of SoCal. They will match whatever you donate x3. Respect.<//Text>

<text>Service was swift, food was freshly prepared, and there wasn't an insane amount of people waiting in the drive-thru lane like usual.
I've never had a bad food experience at this location but I rarely go because the wait time inside and in the drive thru are usually unbearably long.
Note: there's no private parking lot. This is a college campus serving location. Expect long waits when school is in session and weekends. Parking lots in the area are fee based or pay station meters.</text>< pics>

In and out is probably the best burgers in the west coast. Price is very reasonable for the quality burgers. The fries are also very unique. Fresh cut and fried so you can definitely see the difference from other fast-food fries.< /Review>

In-N-Out is of course an experience. The cashier was kind and the food was scrumptious. If you ever go to California go try an In-N-Out burger or In-N-Out anything. You won't be disappointed.</text>

Never a problem even with the long drive thru line. Good customer service.   My only thing would be for some signage posted where the drive thru begins because if there isn't already a long line that extends into the street, you wouldn't be able to find it at night.</text>

<Text>Always gets the orders wrong and this is really ad because of my food allergies. Never buying from this place again and had enough of this terrible customer service and disregard for food allergies. You even tell them to not put any of something then when you open the order you notice little sprinkles of the things.</Text>< user_name>

<Text>Customer service is five stars. The food, however, was not what I expected. This was the first time I've gone to in and out. To me, it's comparable to McDonald's, but this places sauce is better, the bread is better. But I was not moved by the meat. It was really thin and I barely knew it was there.< /Text>< Resp>

<Text>It is great food for the first time in LA, and I would say they are just exclusive other than that nothing too special. One thing that i am not pleasant about is that they order put everything in burger instead of meal which cost few dollars more. The atmosphere is great and would prob come back again in few years</Text><gmapID>0x80c2bc847ebd9929:0x84c4fbfd2dbf86e2</gmapID><Name>Lingju Lin< /Name>< user_id>

There service was good, but I just can't get in to the burger style... too much cheap cheese and the "spread" (dill pickle slaw of a sort) just makes the burgers too gooey. It's not bad, just not my style. Oh, and the fries were a bit weak... not at all crunchy like you would expect... especially during lunch where you'd think they'd be fresh.< /text>

Always fresh every time. Enough said! This location does get super busy with a long drive thru but they're pretty good about coming to your window to take your order. It would be good if they can add a lane for people trying to park and eat there because you have to wait in the drive thru line until you can get in to park.</review>

<text>Always a huge line inside and in the drive through. But they seem to get through orders fairly quickly. Food is always accurate.
I love getting a protein style burger (wrapped in lettuce) here or a burger with no bun with fries.  My brother encourages you to try a shake from here.  I like the lemonade they offer.<//text>< pics>

Good location but every time I go I have to circle the block and wait on an seemingly endless line of cars that wraps around the block. They don't have their own parking lot thats free to park so keep that in mind.<//Text>

As in n outs go this location is very average. The drive-through line inconveniently lines nearby streets, causing a traffic jam and constant honking. The homeless loiter outside or sometimes inside. The staff is friendly.</text>

I would give 0 stars but it wouldn't let me. I came in from out of town with a friend and we ordered food at 12 at night and when we got back to hotel we realized they gave us no straws, shorted us a burger and put onions on it when I said no onions cut im allergic. We were the only ones there at the time so not sure how they messed it up.</review>

<review>In-N-Out Westwood - the one thing about INO is that they are clean and consistent.  Other than that I occasionally go to INO out of convenience, but to be honest, I find their burgers a bit tasteless.  I compensate by ordering extra spread, onions, and tomato.  It helps, but it still lack in flavor.  French fries are good when cooked well-done and fresh!<//review>< user_name>

<Text>Burgers, amazing. Fries, solid. My gripe with this place is the extreme irony of a fast food establishment that routinely takes upwards of 30 or 45 minutes to get patrons through the drive through queue. It is a travesty. I don't understand where the inefficiency stems from, because if you order from the counter inside, you can get in and out pretty quickly. Someone please help me understand how this is possible.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<Text>This is my home in n out, I probably go here the most. Kevin the manager is so kind and generous, if anytime there is a problem, he finds a solution. Food is great but service is better. Came here for a wedding photo shoot and the staff was super friendly and allowed us to do as we pleased. Just expect a line cause this place is always crowded!< /Text>< pictures>

For out of towners you have to experience it once.    Fast food at is fatty and disgusting worst but oh so good.    Burgers are good.   Try the not so secret "Animal Style" which is not on the menu.   Basically cheese, grilled onions, and thousand island dressing.     Order the fries well done so that they are crispier.    Shakes are really good.    Not sure why this is such a "thing" but worth a visit if you are on a budget.    If not, go to the Korean BBQ next door.</review>

<Review>This In n Out is larger than most, it has both inside and outside seating. There are plenty of seats and there is always someone coming around to clean the tables and sweep the floors. The atmosphere is busy and loud with most of the patrons being UCLA students. Of note, as it's in downtown, there are paid parking lots nearby and plenty of paid street parking.

Between 4 individual orders, we got our food fairly quickly. No difference in taste from any other In n Out. I went with my normal double double,  half strawberry half vanilla milk shake, and animal style fries and have no complaints.</Review><Rate>5< /Rate>< Name>

< Review>
I love In N Out!! This location is amazing too. The design of the restaurant is amazing. I always order a double double with grilled onions and "animal style" fries. Their shakes are pretty good too. My only complaint is that the drive through line is so long. Sometimes stretches over a block on the street.</Review>

The 2 stars is not for the food and service. Always excellent food and service. The drive through is horrible. I'm a project manager so I pick up lunch for my guys and time is valuable. I spent about 15 minutes trying to figure out how to get in line for the the drive through. There are no signs to guide you and the entrances to the drive through are in no way related to in and out. Aside from that there's absolutely no parking only 2 compact and a handicap spot in the back. If your a UCLA student it's an idle walk to have food but if your driving by or happened to check Google maps for an In-n-Out donot stop st this one.< /Review>

<Text>Employees here don't work as fast as at other In-and-out's, probably because they are UCLA students. This means that if you're not at the drive through you're going to have to wait a little bit longer than when compared to other locations. Otherwise things are good.</Text>< Pics>

Burgers are average, yes, they are inexpensive because the patty is super thin. Fries are probably the worst you can get around. House lemonade is very good, shakes are ok.

I just moved to LA and this is my first in-n-out. Honestly, it didn't taste bad or anything, however it just tasted like ordinary fast food burger and I felt like I had gotten a juicier patty at some other franchise. So yeah, it's not bad but nothing special either.<//Review>

Your places are always pleasant anyway. However the one there in Westwood (near the UCLA campus) gives of the energy and presence of some sort of major even instead of just another burger joint.
Big shouts out to your image consultants crew! 😄👍<//Review>

It's got pretty good food at best, but seems very overrated. The burgers themselves taste like fast food, the fries are limp and not excellent, and the shakes are fairly good. The staff is friendly, the lemonade is excellent, and the prices are good. Really, go because it's California culture, not because it's amazing.<//text>

It is one of the largest and most efficiently run of the franchises. The place although busy moves the line along very quickly. There are plenty of tables and they keep them clean. Staff is friendly and work very hard to satisfy customers requests in an efficient and friendly matter. Value of food and service is very favorable. The only problems I have encountered or when they are training newbies and they have not talking my order correct but they Rectify that right away.< /text>

It's In-N-Out. What's not to love? The only problem with this place, like most In-N-Out locations, is that it's so good there's often a long line. I recommend going in; the drive-thru is VERY popular.</Review>

Ordered at 2:32 PM received food at 2:47 PM Anthony Cashier took my order I noticed that he was touching cash and giving out cups without washing his hands. His hands repeatedly would touch the lip of each cup he was handing out. Fries were cold and stale staff seemed annoyed at my request to have pepperchinese, spread and ketchup from the back instead of where they place it for self serve. During the 15 minute wait I noticed that the food runner kept on sneezing and covering his mouth with the same hands he was serving the food with. I did not see him washing his hands at all instead I saw him hiding and rubbing his nose. Staff should receive more training in regards to health violations. I did not eat my food after witnessing these events. I did speak with Michelle who identified herself as the manager on deck. I will not be returning to this location. I went to Chick-fil-A instead<//Review>

Normally I would give 3 stars, but I figure if I give 1 management is more likely to actually address this. This is your average in n out, except for the fact that the fries are so incredibly inconsistent that I've gotten everything from fries that crunch like potato chips all the way to fries so raw they were room temperature in the middle. On the plus side, the fries being garbage has made me cut way down on my fast food intake, so maybe it's a blessing in disguise.<//Review>

<resp>None</resp><text>Honestly, good burgers. Gourmet quality burgers for a fast food price in a fast food setting. Much more economically wise than going somewhere like shake shack, my only issue with In N Out is the lack or slow modernization of the tech in the store, especially in the drive thru.< /text><UserId.>109246107783129427134</UserId.>< gmap_id>

It was good but I usually have to sit down to eat my burger with both hands this one I was able to take the paper off hold with one hand and walk outside and eat it and still walk to the parking lot and back with it finished and my fries still a decent temp. Not bad for being busy...<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
Being a student at UCLA, I've been here more times than I should. Never really got a problem except for the one time when their water from the soda dispenser smelled like bleach.
Also, why 1 unisex + 1 female restroom? Make them both unisex! I had waited a few times for the unisex restroom to free up while the female one was unoccupied.<//Review>

Had to try the famous In-N-Out Burger. Thankfully I went with a local who clued me in to order my burger "Animal Style" (with sauteed onions and special sauce). It was delicious but a very long wait (20 minutes)which seems common. Also the food was very greasy.<//text>

Not the best burger but it sure as hell beats McDonald's. Hey, while you're here, try this. Take any number. If it's even, divide by two. If it's odd, multiply by three and add one. Repeat this. Do you always get back to one eventually?< /text>

<Review>Kids who work here are always friendly, kind and helpful. Location is very convenient, within easy walking distance of UCLA. Their drive thru is very fast. I love that they offer lettuce wrap and grilled onions. Lunch time is very busy, the line goes out the door. The menu is simple and quality is high. You must buy one of their T-shirts, they are classic.</Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< Response>

It's a staple of Southern California!  The go-to place for convenient, delicious, and CHEAP fast food!  I love In N Out, and I come to this one on Sunset all the time!  It's full of so many...interesting people due to its location in Hollywood, but I love it!  It's so fun coming here.  In N Out burgers have such amazing value and taste so delicious!!!  If visiting, don't ever miss out on visiting an In N Out!<//review>

Outside design of this In-n-Out looks like they tried to make it look like a McDonald's, it looks out of place. The inside of the establishment although should be every other In-n-Out. The big lettering and sloping ceiling create a exciting yet chill environment. The quality and service like always is top of the line.<//text>

<Review>Definitely one of the nicest In-N-Outs I've been too. They offer a small menu of consistently quality food. Love it or hate it, you always know what you'll get here.

As for me, I'll take an animal style burger, animal style fries and a neopolitan shake.

Yum!</Review>< Pictures>

<text>I wish we had this chain on the East Coast.  This location seems to be pretty busy both at the drive through and the dining room.  The menu is simpler then simple but very tasty.  I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a burger from a fast food chain.  But the uncomplicated methods seem to work.

One thing I do though is add juice to the drink menu.  A little better than sodas but still.<//text>< pics>

Burgers are great but when you get a lettuce wrap the burgers are alittle salty. Also they keep forgetting my order and putting sauce when I ask for no sauce.<//review>

I don't eat burgers anywhere else but IN-N-OUT. Wonderful place to grab and eat my favorite- double double and wash it down with a mighty cup of ice water (no soda for me). Not too crowded inside. I visit once a week.<//text>

<Text>Biggest in n out I've been to. Great food, as usual. There's a ton of students, of course, especially at night on the weekends, so if you're not ok with the slightly drunk, obnoxious crowd, then I recommend you to not come here. If it doesn't bother you, then definitely come here. Seats are almost always available.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

They really need to improve the set-up of this In n Out. Been here a couple times. There's very few spots for parking which makes the drive-thru line incredibly long. A good note on this visit though, my walk-in order To-Go came very quick (3 numbers before me), and it was delicious.< /Text>

Gets really busy due to local UCLA crowd. Delicious burgers, fries, and shakes - can't beat the price either. Line for drive-through forms down the street during regular meal times. Nice outdoor seating in the front of this location too.< /Text>

Sure there is new competitors that pop up to compete with in-n-out, but they have along way to replace a great 4X4 animal style, with extra crispy fries at in-n-out.<//review></record>

Probably one of the most Iconic In-N-Outs in the state, I've very rarely had a burger from here that's less than perfect (and I've visited a LOT).  Because it's so good, it's frequently busy and loud inside.

I typically drive through to save time, but even the drive through is typically very long.  The line often extends into the street and affects traffic, despite the employees taking care of customers very quickly.  Additionally it's a bit of an odd drive through and can be tough to get into.<//Text>

I love In - N - Out. The food is fresh, simple, consistent, and (in my mind) good. That being said, the atmosphere and food can differ slightly from store to store. The Westwood store has good food but the fries are often under-cooked (ask for them crispy!). It also gets EXTREMELY busy being across the street from UCLA. I don't know for certain if parking and going in is faster but it certainly seems that way as the drive-through line often takes close to half an hour when they are very busy. I would recommend going during the non-peak hours.</review>

There’s something wrong with quality control at this In-N-Out. I’ve had very undercooked patties, undercooked fries well, and other issues at this location. Have had to complain multiple times to customer service. Losing confidence in this location.</Review>

Staff we're extremely nice ,
Very clean ,
Big spacious ,
And everything was done in a timely manner
**And the most important food was perfect **

Some downside is the price seems a little higher than other locations and it's not clear where is the entrance to the drive thru .<//Text></record>

<review>In-N-Out is a staple, a classic. There's good reason why this place is a legend. The food is always consistent and always fresh. I've had better fries, but these ones are actually fresh and real.  My favorite is a protein animal style double double with banana peppers. Absolutely delicious.< /review><user_id>116579609121253458406<//user_id><Rate>5</Rate><Time>1448814822352< /Time><gmapID>0x80c2bc847ebd9929:0x84c4fbfd2dbf86e2</gmapID></record>

Can't ever go wrong with In n Out!  As an ex employee I've seen behind the scenes. Everything is broughtvin fresh. Meat and produce doesn't sit in the store longer than 48 hrs. Always fresh and the customer is always right.<//review>

You've heard it before, this place serves up the best fast food hamburger in the business. This place in particular, located steps from UCLA, has its hands full, but hits it out of the park consistently.

Very convenient location for this excellent California burger chain. The food is as great as ever but service was a bit uneven. The drive through is a little hidden and goes via some back lots; it's relatively easy to miss the turn from the road.< /text>

Delicious burgers with a drive-through. My favorite is a 2x2 protein style with grilled onions and sliced chilies. Their chocolate and strawberry milkshakes aren't bad either. Sometimes the wait can be long during rush hour when all the undergrads rush in<//Text>

<review>Best burgers in town!! In N Out it is. Out of all locations i'd say that this one is the nicest one just because of the design and the spacing they have. We always come here to have lunch before we go study for an exam. Come by here for great vibes & food. Go Bruins!!<//review></record></dataset><record>

I may be an outlier, but I don't understand what the fuss is all about with this limited-menu chain. Shakes are too sweet, fries aren't crispy and the burgers are just OK. For the carb phobic, you can order your burger on lettuce instead of a bun. There are two off-menu items that I know of, animal style fries--covered in sauce, onions and cheese--and grilled cheese. But beware: there is nothing grilled about the grilled cheese, a slice of American cheese with lettuce and tomato on a burger bun, all drowned in the signature sauce. On the plus side, servers are friendly and polite and the restaurant is very clean.<//text>

This place/fast food chain has fame to make the best burgers of the city.
Most people from LA prefer them to Mc Donald's and Burger King's ones.
Good and cheap. Give them a chance and you will not be disappointed.</Text>

<Review>Few other burger places deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as In N Out.  It might be the only place you can’t over-hype, it always exceeds my expectations.  I’d eat it every day if I lived close enough to one.  If no one has mentioned it to you yet, get your fries “animal style”, thank me later.<//Review>< pics>

<pics>None</pics><review>It's in n out, a west coast staple. Their burgers are great in their simplicity. Their fries are crisp and wholesome. Sweet shakes and a killer secret menu round out the amazingness that is In n Out.
Protip: if you like fries, order them well done, they will do a double fry on them and in my opinion, makes them perfect
Specific to this location, the drive thru is weirdly placed, behind the store and around an alleyway. Look for some arrows on the ground in between the in n out and the next door building< /review>< Response>

This is not in n outs fault directly... maybe they should just open five more locations on that block to meet the demand.... lol<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2bc847ebd9929:0x84c4fbfd2dbf86e2<//gmap_id></record>

<text>Too many people rushing in and out...hence the name right? But seriously, they need to slow down their pace and actually care for the food they cook up. The bread is usually burnt, and they just smash everything together really sloppy as if they were trying to get it out the door as quickly as possible. I've been to other In-N-Out burger joints and they have tasted amazing. This just ruins the name for that company.</text></record>

<text>Best part is the low price for a big crispy burger with fresh lettuce and tomato.  Worst part is the crazy long line ALL the time!

Also, if you drive through, they give you paper place mats and the food in a vintage style cardboard box!  Very retro!< /text>< UserId.>

This location was VERY busy when we went. Orders were being taken by staff members walking to each car through the drive thru which made our wait time only about 10 minutes max. The fries were not my favorite, they seemed to have a stale taste, the burger was quite good (the spread makes the burger for sure)!<//review>

In-N-Out is always and excellent quick meal. Their animal fries are absolutely the best fries of any fast food place in the area.</Review>

It's an In-n-Out, what can I say. The burgers are fine, the fries are disgustingly limp. It's always that way. Very consistent. Some people rave about them, so if you're one of those, you'll like this one too.<//Review>

The food lives up to the quality of the chain, but your wait time will be 30+ minutes.

Seriously. I've gone there at odd hours in the morning. 11:00 am. 3:30pm. Super late at night. It's never been fast. The line seems to block traffic on Gayley 24/7.

I once tried to "race" my partner by going inside. I beat his waiting in the car line - by 2 minutes.

If you want food in ten minutes or less you need to go somewhere else.<//review>

I've heard the hype, so I had to check it out when I got the chance. Put simply, I'm a convert. I got my burger animal style and the fries normal, and they were both amazing. Sadly I didn't have room to try one of their shakes. Next time, whenever that may be!<//Text>

Terrible friend. Cold. Replace ement fries the same. 3rd time (I waited 15+mins (forgotten?) and had to remind them.) animal fries hardly warm. Yes the toppings were hot but not the fries. Awful experience.< /review>

<text>HOME OF THE BRUINS! This In-n-out is just minutes from campus and offers the classics: single, double double (my personal favorite), animal style fries. I recommend a double double with grilled onions and animal style fries. If you either want to feel old, reminisce about your college days or just hanging around in Westwood, this is a great place to watch drunk UCLA students and people watch especially after midnight. Entertaining experience.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>In n out is always consistent and has no issues for me but there is a big issue with the drive through system as well as the parking situation. If you do get lucky and find parking I suggest you go inside to order because it will take less than 5 minutes versus the 30+ minutes at a drive through<//Review>< Resp>

Okay, I had the unortunate experience of dealing with a real bad customer service. Without elaborating too much. With that said, I wish there more organized custoemr service experience during peak hours especially during the weekends. Just knocking out one star. Other than that, all good and still great food.<//Review>

The food is standard for In-N-Out.  Horrible parking lot in the rear with one handicap space and two others (very cramped).  Street park and walk over if you want to eat indoors.  Good number of tables inside.  Small amount of outside seating out front.  Drive-through starts on Gayley Avenue in an alleyway and loops around the backside.   During busy times, the line extends out into the street and down the block to the light.  Usually packed around lunch and dinner.  Short or no line at the drive-through between 10:30AM and 11AM.</Text>

Hadn't been in years.  I was at the Geffen playhouse and was craving the burgers it wasn't how I remembered them to be.  The meat was so thin it was like they took a party and split it in half and called it a double double.  I don't think I'll be craving them anytime soon.<//review>

One of the many things I love about Cali! I can have In-N-Out burgers 365 days!  The animal style is yummy, loaded w sauteed onions and dressing that beats Mickey D' big mac any day.  I'm a east coast'er, so I envy all my So Cal friends of this gem. Milk shakes are good too! Fries need a little work but I have a feeling they are healthier than others fast food joints (cooked in beef fat).  I would give up Shake Shack any day, any time for an In-N-Out to be in NYC... Always a first stop for us upon arrival to LA!</Review>

There is a secret menu that is not so secret such as the animal fries (french fries with their special sauce and cheese). You can also get packets of their sauce to put on your hamburger if you ask.</review>< Pictures>

Double double protein style and animal fries. That is all you need. Per usual, there is a wait, but they do a great job of providing fast and friendly service.</review>

This review is based on the two times I visited this place, once when they first opened and once again just about a week ago.

I was not impressed with the quality of the burgers!
The prices might be a lot more affordable than most burgers places in the area, but I think quality trumps price any day.<//review>

Pure perfection!

Only problem is they can't keep up with the demand.  This is not only their busiest but their most profitable location in all of California.

At times the the line for the drive-through goes around the block so if you're in a rush you may be faster to park and go inside and Order.<//Text>

<text>Be aware that there is zero parking in this neighborhood. Just past in n out is Le Conte St, and if you turn right on Le Conte and go a block, there's a public parking lot. It's not free, but if you're in a pinch it works and it's not a long walk. :)< /text>< Pics>

Best burger in this, or any, Universe. You can get a costlier, fancier, or bigger burger, but not better. Period. And they'd get 5 stars but about 1 of every 3 visits they get something wrong...<//Text>

I mean. Anybody who loves burgers has heard stories. Being from Boston I'd never had the chance. Once I got to LA I had my heart and stomach set on a Double Double Animal style with fries. Totally amazing. Every word I'd ever heard was true.< /text>

Look up the not so secret menu before you go. I enjoyed a 2*2 animal style. Milk shakes are heavy duty.</Text>

I love In-N-Out, but this one in particular is so crowded it's terrifying. I've been to a good number of these restaurants but this one is one of the busiest. It also takes a while for them to clean the tables so you spend a good amount of time looking for a clean spot to eat after waiting for forever to receive your food.<//text>

Yes, the line is long but come on... Worth the wait. In-N-Out does burgers the way they should always be made. Consistently good and righteously priced.< /Review>

if u r looking for a real tasty juicy classic style burger then this is ur destination, the burger is amazing in a way that ordering one burger would never be enough, and their classic fries is amazing specially if u added melted cheese on it and the service is always good and full of hospitality, so whenever u crave a burger this should be ur first place to pop up in ur mind, i highly recommend it<//Review>

<Review>Everything is like all In-N-Outs, the service is good and fast, there's always space which is nice and the animal style food is just as good as elsewhere. I recommend it if you just want a burger and some fries.< /Review></record>

<text>Great burgers, especially for the price. Always a stop when I'm on LA. Line up is quick, just a small wait on the food.</text>< pics>

<Text>Most overrated burger joint in Los Angeles. I'll never understand the hype that the sheep of the "Follower Generation" have built around this place... The burgers barely rate a notch above McDonald's in size and taste, and there a countless burger spots that surpass this place in every way, shape, or form, that I can't do anything but laugh at the marketing slaves waiting 35 minutes in the drive-thru for their "fast food" burger.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2bc847ebd9929:0x84c4fbfd2dbf86e2< /gmapID></record>

<text>In n out burger is always worth a trip and is the best fast food around! But please google the secret menues because otherwise they dont have sooo much different variations of the menues! Take the biggest size of beverage as the price value difference is super good for it. The workers where all really friendly even when they are really busy! Enjoyed my stay there and the food!</text>< pictures>

<Review>Awesome service and the great food In-N-Out is known for. As it is near the medical facility and UCLA don't count on parking. The drive thru while prompt does regularly have a line arround the block. Gotta get some In-N-Out!<//Review>< Pictures>

Is a good change from regular McDonald's burgers  though there's not a great selection. Ask for animal style fries, those are off the menu.<//Review>

In n out is famous so of course you have to come and try it if you're not from around here. I usually see the line coming out the door but it moves quicker than you'd think so I'd definitely wait it out if you want that yummy food :)< /review>

No parking. I ordered outside then found a parking spot( there is only two) I told genteman with pad outside to change order to eating in. He said sure. I paid inside and told casier that I ordered outside and I wanted to eat inside. He said sure no problem. I sat for a while without hearing my number. When I went to iquire the sane cashier looked at me like I was a Martian. I explained everything again. He went to the the window area and grabbed the old order that was sitting there for a while and brought it to me. No apologies. I asked for a new order and waited again of course while others picked up there food . No apologies. Wow</text>

<Review>Love the food. Consistent quality that iconizes the SoCal experience. My favorite combination of items in one order is a 4x4 burger, animal fries, and a neopolitan shake, with a bunch of peppercinis and ketchup and spread sauce for dipping and, well, spreading.<//Review>< resp>

Pillar of Westwood. Prepare for long lines at the drive through as it can be enough to back traffic up into the street during peak hours. The fries actually taste like potatoes. Real ice cream shakes !< /Text>

<Text>One of those pit stops in LA that you have to go to.  As an original San Diegon, this restaurant is one that I miss often.  The burgers and fries are under $2 and the "Secret" combinations are an eye grabber.  You can get the "animal style" burgers or fries which includes cooked onions, some special sauce and cheese.  Make your burger a "double double" for for two patties or just go with a "single" if you're not that hungry.<//Text>< pics>

It's In n Out. What else do I need to say? Best bang for your buck on a freshly made burger.</Review>

My go-to In-N-Out @ Westwood.  Horrid street parking (if you're even lucky to find any, as this is Westwood after all).  Menu is simple and standard with burgers and cheeseburgers.  The patties are small and thin, so don't expect anything too special, but it's still a step up over McDonalds/Burger King and the likes.  The fries are tasty.  Good bang for the buck, but not as healthy as advertised.  Almost always packed.</Review>

<review>Whenever I return to LA, I must visit In-N-Out at least once. The prices are shocking considering the value (how is a cheeseburger $1.90??), and for a fast-food restaurant, the quality is quite outstanding.

The fries were overdone and turned to dust in your mouth. Hoping we just got a bad batch and that is not how they normally are. Burgers were only ok.< /text>

I would normally give In-N-Out 4 stars, because the food is solid and at a reasonable price. However, this place does not have enough parking and it can get super crazy with the drive-thru line, so one star off for that.<//text>

This is my local In N Out so I've been here plenty of times. Food is pretty average and what you'd expect from any chain. Occasionally, they don't always cook the meat all the way through so I'd make sure you double check just in case. Wait time is pretty average. Staff is generally pretty friendly and bathrooms as well as the rest of the restaurant are always clean. The drive-thru spills out to Gayley and that combined with people stopping for Fat Sals, etc. it's kind of a hecticy traffic area.

Also, unbeknowst there is actually a couple parking spots behind, right in between the store and the drive-thru line. If you're lucky, you can park here or it's a great spot to park your motorcycle if you have one :P</text>

They make the protein style burgers proper here ✨👌. A little busy at times, but apparently they also give out free hot cocoa to kids when it's raining! That's golden ✨👌<//Text>

<review>Your typical  In-n-out, for better or worse (better for me, since I love the chain). Nice design and a good amount of seating, although service can be slow (and fries slightly undercooked) due to hordes of students.<//review>< Pictures>

I was told to order the "double double animal style" due to the huge hype and was forever dissatisfied. There was no flavor in the meat. Couldn't taste the sauce and the fries was extremely stale. Horrible experience and I still hold Whataburger "a Texas burger chain" to the top of the list. In-N-Out burger is not even better than the double quarter pounder from McDonald's. Very sad, I will not be back to this burger chain. I see why they are so cheap. 👎<//review>

The burgers are good, I'm not a fan of the fries though.  The wait is also usually brutal.< /Review>

I live in n out! This one just suffers from lack of parking and if you decide to use the drive thru, if the line is long enough you might find yourself parked by fat Sal's.</text>

The drive-through line can get a little ridiculous during rushes, and there's not much room around here to park. Pretty standard In-N-Out. Cheap, tasty fast food.</Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) In n out burger, which is very popular in the United States, is really people every day. Many tourists come to try it out near Beverly. I won’t say much about many burger guides, the restaurant atmosphere is very warm, and the service attitude is also very good! !

(Translated by Google) Needless to say, in-and-out. Fresh tomatoes and lettuce and delicious patties 🍔

I always order an animal-style item, but it's nice that it's just under $ 3 and it's kind to your wallet. Sometimes I go when I want to eat a hamburger.
Drive-throughs are always lined up and scared.

(Original)
言わずと知れたインアンドアウト。トマトやレタスがフレッシュかつパテも美味しい🍔

私はいつもアニマルスタイルの単品で頼むのですが、３ドル弱とお財布に優しいのが素敵。たまにハンバーガー食べたいなって時に行きます。
ドライブスルーもいつも並んでてびびる。<//Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) In-N-Out Burger Point near UCLA. I went to lunch, but there are more than 10 cars in drive through. -.-

I pay $ 10.5 for a public parking lot, and I get a $ 3 basic hamburger.

It takes some time to make immediately after ordering, the soft feeling of bread, the overall taste is just plain. However, fried potatoes feel damp -.-

UCLA 근처 In-N-Out 버거점. 점심 때 갔었는데, Drive through에는 차가 10대 이상 대기중-.-

퍼블릭 주차장에 10.5불 주고, 나는 3불 짜리 기본 햄버거 먹음ㅋ

주문 후 바로 만드는지 시간이 좀 걸리고 빵이 부드러운 느낌이고, 전반적인 맛은 그냥 보통. 단, 감자튀김은 눅눅한 느낌-.-<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQFWMegB6gJ0amy2WoSHtWEzCLC4Ec3h94WAIy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyU1e69ff302ODBif9cm86t-VOxVx_wNENDeyW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

(Translated by Google) The staff are friendly and the food is delicious and it came out quickly, but it wasn't that amazing. It's just like a fresh burger, and I can't say that Korea has a huge difference from in-and-out sub-burgers.

(Original)
직원도 친절하고 음식도 맛있고 빨리 나왔습니다만 그렇게 엄청나게 맛있는가 그런건 아니었습니다. 딱 신선한 버거라고 표현할 만한 정도고 한국에 인앤아웃 아류 버거들과 엄청큰 차이가 있다고 할 수는 없을것같아요 감자튀김은 좀 별로구 패티는 더블더블로 드세요 그게 훨나음<//text>

(Translated by Google) I had a double double combo. I didn't feel better than I thought. Good amount. The girl ate well. Not much french fries. It's spicy looking like a little pepper.

더블더블 콤보 먹었음. 생각보다 느끼하지 않았음. 양도 적당함. 여자도 거뜬히 다 먹었음. 감자 튀김은 별로. 꼬마 고추같이 생긴거 매웠음.< /Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) In and Out is so delicious.
Because of the head office policy to start cooking after order entering,
It takes a while, but it's fresher and more delicious.
The french fries were so crunchy and good.
The freshness is so important that it's only a few hundred kilometers in the west!

(Original)
인앤아웃 너무 맛있어요.
주문 들어간 뒤에 조리를 시작하는 본사 정책 때문에,
시간이 조금 걸리기는 하지만, 그만큼 더 신선하고 맛있어요.
감자튀김도 너무 바삭바삭하고 좋았어요.
신선도를 중요시 해서 서부에서도 반경 몇 백 킬로미터 이내에만 있다고 하네요~ 추천합니다!< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOX3AWniSWa_oEoVZ5uHUDMxRUhU1oDO1hrCmNm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEPbp18wReWh3iMn5pMBJqjffJAhXT053CmzIi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPf6tTIYZ8AE4kb3KxAQ6E71_fQt98jJTVWghOL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

I recommend eating it without adding onion.

(Translated by Google) What to say if this is THE must-have fast food in California. The menu is clearly very simple so do not expect to have a plethora of quirky burgers of any kind. Burger, cheese burger, double, fries, ice cream and soda. Simple clear and precise. The advantage and especially the strong point of in nout is undeniably quality and hygiene. They are so proud that you can see everything that happens in the kitchen and those from any fast food. I recommend at least test once but do not hesitate to watch before rush hour because you can easily have 30 / 40mn waiting.

Que dire si ce n'est LE fast-food incontournable en Californie. La carte est clairement très simple vous attendez pas à avoir pléthore de burgers 🍔 farfelues en tout genre.

Ils en sont tellement fiers que vous pouvez voir tout ce qui ce passe dans la cuisine et ceux depuis n'importe quel fast-food. Je recommande au moins de tester une fois mais n'hésitez pas à regarder avant les heures de pointes car vous pouvez facilement avoir 30/40mn d'attente.< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) I came home a little late, wrapped my wife-daughter and three. 1 double double, just 1 burger, 1 fry, 1 of cola, I really enjoyed it. The burger buns were so crunchy and moist (the inside and the inside) were so nice. I couldn't order onions for roasting, and I missed the order of spread sauce with fry sauce, so I'm going to go back.

다소 늦게 집에 들어와서, 와이프-딸아이랑 셋이 포장해서 먹었습니다. 더블더블1개, 그냥 버거 1개, 프라이 1개, 콜라-중 1개, 정말 맛있게 잘 먹었습니다. 버거빵이 바삭한 느낌 + 촉촉한 느낌(겉과 속)이 함께 느껴져서 너무 좋았네요. 양파를 구이식으로 주문하지 못했고, 프라이 소스로 스프레드 소스를 주문 못한게 좀 아쉬워서 다시 가려합니다.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>(Translated by Google) California specialty burger. In-N-Out Hamburg (in and out of Hamburg) is a local fast food restaurant on the west coast of the United States. It was first created in 1948 by Harry and Esther Snyder in Baldwin Park, California. The current In-N-Out is headquartered in Irvine, California, and the chain stores are located in California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Oregon and Texas. In-N-Out's menu is open to three types of burgers: burgers, cheeseburgers, and "double-layer cheese" (two pieces of beef, two pieces of cheese); French fries and drinks; and three flavors of milkshakes. Lettuce and tomato are placed in the burger, and the customer can choose to put the onion. In-N-Out's burger contains a special sauce made with Thousand Island Sauce.

In addition to the above public menus, In-N-Out also offers some meals that do not appear on the public menu, which customers can order at any In-N-Out. These meal items belonging to the In-N-Out secret menu can be found on the company website. These secret meals include "double-layered beef burgers" (two-layer beef patties, no cheese slices) "3x3" (three patties, three patties), "4x4" (four slices of beef patties, four slices) , Neapolitan ice cream, Roasted cheese (two-piece grilled cheeseless cheeseburger), protein wind burger (cheese burger with lettuce lettuce instead of bread) and animal wind Burger with french fries. 3x3, 4x4, protein style, and animal style are all In-N-Out signature dishes and registered trademarks. There are two grilled cheeses, fried onions and special sauces in the animal-style French fries; the animal-style burgers contain lettuce lettuce, tomatoes, pickled cucumbers, and mustard sauce. [10]

Another feature of In-N-Out is that customers can specify any number of patties and cheeses in a burger (the fare increases are required by the customer), but since 2004 a customer requested 100 pieces of meat in a single burger. After the cake and 100 pieces of cheese [11], the burger shop decided to ban four patties and four burgers.

加州特色汉堡.In-N-Out漢堡（出入汉堡）是美國西海岸一家地方性的連鎖快餐店，於1948年由Harry與Esther Snyder夫婦在加州Baldwin Park市首次創建。現在的In-N-Out總部位於美國加州爾灣市，而連鎖店則分布到了加州、亞利桑那州、內華達州、猶他州、奧勒岡州與德州。In-N-Out的菜單公開有三種漢堡：漢堡、起士漢堡、與「雙層起司堡」（兩片牛肉、兩片起士）；炸薯條與飲料；以及三種味道的奶昔。漢堡中放萵苣、番茄，並且顧客可以選擇放入洋蔥。In-N-Out的漢堡中放有一種特色醬料，以千島醬製作。

除了以上的公開菜單，In-N-Out還提供了一些沒有出現在公開菜單上的餐點，顧客可以在任何一家In-N-Out點選這些餐點。這些屬於In-N-Out秘密菜單的餐點資料，可以在公司網站上查詢到。這些秘密餐點包括了「雙層牛肉漢堡」（兩層牛肉餅、沒有起司片）「3x3」（三片肉餅、三片起士）、「4x4」（四片牛肉餅、四片起士）、那不勒斯奶昔（英语：Neapolitan ice cream）、烤起司堡（多加兩片烤起司的無肉起司漢堡）、蛋白質風漢堡（以萵苣生菜代替麵包的起司漢堡）以及動物風漢堡與薯條。3x3、4x4、蛋白質風格，以及動物風格皆為In-N-Out招牌菜以及註冊商標。動物風薯條裡有兩片烤起司、炒洋蔥以及店家特殊醬料；動物風漢堡則含有萵苣生菜、蕃茄、醃小黃瓜、芥末醬現煎牛肉片。[10]

In-N-Out原本還有一道特色是顧客可以指定一個漢堡中放置任意數量的肉餅與起士（加價需顧客自付），但自2004年一位顧客要求單隻漢堡中放置100片肉餅與100片起士後[11]這家漢堡店還是決定禁止四片肉餅與四片起士以上的漢堡<//Review>< response>

The worst thing is that they call each order by its number, which is fine, however they do it at full volume which is quite annoying. I can personally tell you not to spend time searching for this place and choose any other burger restaurant.

(Original)
Son más famosas de lo que se merecen, son pequeñas, son mas económicas que en otros lugares, no las puedes pedir con tocino. Lo peor es que llaman a cada pedido por su numero, lo qur está bien, sin embargo lo hacen a todo volumen lo que es bastante molesto. Personalmente les puedo decir que no gasten tiempo buscando este lugar y elijan cualquier otro restaurante de hamburguesas.<//Review></record>

<text>(Translated by Google) To try if you are in California, it is the most famous chain of hamburgers. Remember the old 80s fast food even in red and white furnishings. The sandwiches are of 3 types but delicious and the chips have the distinction of being cut fresh and fried. If you are greedy, try the fries with Ceddar, onion and their pink sauce! Cheap !

(Original)
Da provare se siete in California, è la catena più  famosa di hamburger. Ricorda i vecchi fast food anni '80 anche negli arredamenti tutti rossi e bianchi. I panini sono di 3 tipi ma squisiti e le patatine hanno la particolarità di essere tagliate fresche e fritte. Se siete golosi assaggiate le fries con il Ceddar, la cipolla e la loro salsa rosa! Economico !< /text>< rating>

Very well attended (Westwood and UCLA)
The card is minimalist and the products are fresh.
The service is excellent for a fast food because it has many people behind the counter.

We are not wrong when we go in and out.

<Text>(Translated by Google) I would say that it is one of the best fast food hamburgers I've tried to see because the potatoes were a bit past and they did not know very well.

On the other hand I loved what in the drink dispenser they gave lemonade that the truth is that it was very tasty and refreshing.

The prices are very affordable.

(Original)
Diría que es una de las mejores hamburgueserías de comida rápida que he probado a ver porque las patatas estaban un poco pasadas y no sabían muy bien.

Por otra parte me encantó qué en el dispensador de bebida dieran limonada que la verdad es que estaba muy sabrosa y refrescante.

Los precios son muy asequibles.</Text>< name>

(Translated by Google) One of the best burgers in Los Angeles, good quality and cheap, is that no matter when you go, there are not many people waiting in line.

洛杉矶最好吃的汉堡之一，物美价廉，就是无论什么时候去，排队的人都不见少。<//text>

(Translated by Google) I'm full even though I've only eaten one double.
Honestly, Animal French Fry feels a bit.
At first, I wasn't good at French Fries, but I told him to eat Animal Fries.

(Original)
더블더블 하나만 먹었는데도 배부름.
솔직히 애니멀 프렌치프라이는 조금 느끼함.
처음에 프렌치프라이로 잘 못 나왔는데, 말하니까 애니멀프라이도 먹으라고 더 줌.</Review>

(Translated by Google) For a fast food restaurant, this one in Westwood is no different than any other in’n’out burger in the US. Waiting times here are shorter than in the other smaller stores, clean, spacious and the toilets under control are very clean. The food typical of a system catering - but something special here. The chain is largely and with a few exceptions only in the California area.

Für ein Fast Food Restaurant ist dieses hier in Westwood nicht anders als alle anderen In‘n‘Out Burger in den USA. Hier sind die Wartezeiten Gefühl kürzer als in den anderen kleineren Stores, sauber, großzügig angelegt und die Toiletten unter Kontrolle sehr sauber.

It is very fashionable among UCLA university students. The atmosphere is fresh and simple, unpretentious, it is still a hamburger shop, but the mystery lies in discovering the secret ingredients. And I can not say more.

(Translated by Google) A classic among classics. You can't leave California without trying a hamburger from this hamburger chain. The delicious freshly grilled veal makes your burgers make a difference. They have a "secret" menu that you can watch online. I recommend the neopolitan milkshake and the protein burger (hamburger wrapped in lettuce instead of bread) and the animal style fries.

Un clásico entre los clásicos. No puedes marcharte de California sin probar una hamburguesa de esta cadena de hamburgueserías. La deliciosa carne de ternera recién hecha a la plancha hace que sus hamburguesas marquen la diferencia. Tienen un menú "secreto" que puedes mirar online. Recomiendo el neopolitan milkshake y la protein burger (hamburguesa envuelta en lechuga en lugar de pan) y las animal style fries.<//Text>
