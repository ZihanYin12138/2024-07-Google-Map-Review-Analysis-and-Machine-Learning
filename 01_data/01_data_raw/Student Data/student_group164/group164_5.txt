<Text>I have found this product to meet my needs for document signing. With the changes of working from home and less personal contact over the past year and half it has been nice to have this product. The clients state it is easier to understand and use than other document signing programs.</Text>< Pics>

<text>I have had an excellent experience with setting up and using eSign Genie for the small insurance agency I work for. I had a dedicated representative walk me through how to use the site, and he worked with my schedule since I had to break it into multiple days due to a busy couple of weeks at that time. He was patient and answered all of my questions. I have not had any issues with the Genie going through "Maintenance" during working hours or any outages that lasted more than a split second - can't say that about any other software or applications we use daily. It is simple to use, and has many great features including adding your company logo to your documents. It was a small learning curve with my team, and I have had no complaints about it at all!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The website and software are very easy to use.  Our customers have been satisfied with their experience using it on their ends as well, with virtually no issues in the signing process.  The branding options stand out among other e-sign programs and are easily customizable.  It is a very good value for the service.< /Review>< userid>

We use eSign Genie at Custom Fitness to limit client attrition associated with resigning contracts and to lessen the friction for new clients as they become members. It allows us the ability to gather legally binding electronic signatures from both our local and non local clients. The software is easy to use and customize which helps us not waste time on the set up of documents.</Text>

As a Licensed Professional Counselor working independently, I found what I needed in HIPPA compliant Document e-signing with eSign Genie.  I can import my own documents and templates to send to my clients.  They can sign from their phones or other devices.  Works as expected and the price was within my budget with all the features I needed.< /review>

First and foremost, the platform is incredibly user friendly! The home screen makes navigation easy and I can keep it as surface level or in depth as I like. As the main admin I am able to make adjustments to all the settings and assign users to different levels of abilities. I love the auto-reminders and status updates.

Additionally, I love that I can see the progress of a document. After it is sent, I can open the pending document and see if the signer has viewed it. I can also see how much of the document has been completed, which allows for easy tracking and time management.

My absolute favorite thing is how quickly the team works to get everything running smoothly. I've only had 2-3 times where the system was down or there was an issue and within 5 minutes it is always up and running again.< /Review>

We've been using eSign Genie, often daily, for a few months now, after changing from another comparably-priced software that we used for a year.  eSign Genie has proven more straight-forward for both ourselves and our signers.  We send agreements to guests who need to sign, input information, and return quickly.  The learning curve is easy, setting up our templates and email messages is easy, and it is easy to line up the text boxes so that they look perfect in the documents (that was one of our frustrations with the other software.) We have contacted the company once with a technical issue that they resolved and haven't had to contact them since.  We compare that to all the times we contacted the previous software support team for help (and they were great to work with) further supporting our recommendation that this software is truly user friendly.< /review>

This is truly an awesome and affordable product for proposal e-signatures

The software makes it super easy to connect your existing documents and send them to customers for e-signatures. I've used other platforms that were 10x the cost and this performs just as well.

With my usage of the platform, I really haven't found any cons. My needs are relatively simple - easily track and send proposals to customers for signatures. Loving this so far.< /text>

My law firm has used eSign Genie for about three years and we couldn't be happier with them! The platform is easy to use for both my firm and clients, the price is very affordable for all of the great features that you get, and the support staff are incredibly helpful and responsive if you need help. I tried out many other e-signature platforms, and none were as robust and affordable as eSign Genie. Without a doubt, eSign Genie is the best and we look forward to continuing to work with them for years to come!< /review>

I've been using eSign Genie for a little over a year now and I have nothing but good words for this service.

I'm in the rental real estate business and needed an e-signature platform that integrated well with our Google drive based documents. I also wasn't willing to pay the outrageous prices some other services were charging. When I found eSign Genie, I was surprised to see that it checked off all the boxes for us.

And to top it off, the 2 times I needed support, I was quickly taken care of by their excellent customer service team. A quick chat was the only thing needed to get me set up.

Highly recommended!<//text>

I have nothing but fantastic things to say about eSign Genie. As most people who have priced out or use electronic signature software know, the major players in this field can charge exorbitant corporate/enterprise pricing.

Esign Genie is not only affordable but their Product Service/Account Management team is fantastic. Chris was very easy to work with, very knowledgeable about the product, helped us set up, and get going quickly. The software itself is much more user intuitive than others I have used and we were able to get documents out to our clients less than a week after purchasing.

Overall great product with wonderful customer service.< /text>

<review>I am a solo bankruptcy attorney who needs clients to be able to easily review and sign documents that I file with the court and use with other attorneys.  eSign Genie has made it very simple for me to create signable documents for my clients that they can access through an email or text message link.  The web site is easy to use and it only takes me a few minutes to create the documents.  This has been a lifesaver for my firm during the pandemic as in-person meetings have been restricted.<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808fb5a6ab955555:0x1f60331a2b889aa8< /gmapID></record>

eSign Genie is very easy to set up and use. They have a very knowledgeable staff who are friendly and ready to help. The software allows you to set rules to delete incomplete forms automatically and much more. I had some trouble getting started, but the great guys at eSign Genie helped me figure out what I was doing wrong. We needed a way to digitize membership forms and they have become a simple solution to a big problem. eSign Genie is by far the easiest to set up and the most cost-effective product on the market. Thanks, guys.<//Text>

We have used eSign genie for a number of years, but since Covid began it's literally used daily. It's simple to use, the site is easy to navigate, and customers don't have issues using it.  If I had ever had any issues I was able to chat and issues were resolved instantly. I would highly recommend for any type of business.< /review>

I use eSign Genie for rental leases on a small multi-family property. The thing that originally brought me to them was the "Pay As You Go" feature.  It's much more affordable for me since I only need 20 documents a year.

At first I found eSign Genie to be a bit more confusing than what I was used to with a different and much more expensive doc esign company. Now, I can navigate their system like a breeze. My tenants are able to execute the documents quick and easily so I have no complaints.

I definitely recommend eSign Genie for a small non-profit organization like mine looking for something affordable and easy to use.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>eSign Genie has been fundamental in aiding our organization to stay in compliance with various government agencies, especially now during the Covid-19 issue affecting all of us. We have several people working from home and they have employees that they manage, out in the field. It has been a challenge to disseminate documents for signature and tracking to make sure they are returned on a timely basis – following up with snail mail originals. eSign Genie has absolutely changed the way we function and do business since this is all now done virtually and has relieved a lot of stress on managers and the organization’s home office employees.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>The document creation interface was smooth for both individual documents and bulk templated documents. The bulk documents I needed signed (by hundreds of different signers) was exceptionally simple to accomplish. The resulting signed documents were praised by the Legal Dept. Also, the delivery of the signed documents was smooth.

I tested 3 document signing services for a project that entailed resolving debts with 361 subcontractors stemming from a customer bankruptcy. I need to deliver a notification email and the Debt Resolution Agreement to each subcontractor, Some were for negotiated amounts and some were for standard % amounts, eSignGenie.com allowed me to do both functions with similar preparation. The resulting signed documents simply appeared in my inbox in a format I could forward to accounting with little or no other work needed</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808fb5a6ab955555:0x1f60331a2b889aa8< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I've been using eSign Genie for over two years. They've made a lot of improvements to it since I started using the product. It's easy and fast to use and the user interface is very intuitive. It compares well with others I've used as a recipient.
The pay-by-document pricing is perfect for my infrequent needs.< /text>

I was looking for an esign program that I could just use as needed. Many other's were monthly subscriptions, etc. I use this to esign service agreements with new customers. We only need it every so often, so this was a good fit for us. And comparatively I find it inexpensive and easy to use.< /text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>This software has all the features that were important to me. Like conditional fields, multiple signers and when updating a form or application you don't have to start over again. The software is VERY flexible.

Creating a document that is easy for a client to understand and complete is a game changer. We are already experiencing a higher document completion rate than when we were with either DocuSign or Adobe (echosign)

eSign Genie has been a total solution for all my e-signing needs. Since I'm in the financial industry many of my documents need to be signed. Allowing our clients to sign online without printing , scanning, faxing or emailing anything is a game changer. There are many options out there for eSigning and I've used several. However, eSign genie has the best software, the best customer support I've ever seen (Lisa is who helps me most of the time and she is AMAZING) and all at a price that is a fraction of the competition< /Review>< Pics>

I decided to sell my own home as it was to hard to swallow giving away over 20k the last time I did. So I needed a solution to esign as there are a bunch of documents you have to deal with during the sale of a home. It worked great and the cost was very reasonable. The UI was simple to learn and understand, even intuitive. And when you run out, you get a message and purchase 5 more. I would use this even if I needed a subscription. Excellent product. I work in software and usability, cost and intuitive UI is the gold standard. I think eSign Genie has set the bar high.</Review>

<Text>I'm very satisfied with eSign Genie. I am CEO of a small research nonprofit. Our studies require that we use CFR 21 part 11 compliant document signature and storage software. eSign Genie's template designer and programmability combined with their level of support and professionalism set them apart from more established brands such as DocuSign and Adobe Sign which require larger subscription purchases which exceeded our project budget.< /Text><gmap_id>0x808fb5a6ab955555:0x1f60331a2b889aa8</gmap_id>< pics>

<text>I found most esign programs offer the same features and I did not find any of them hard to use . The real selling point for us with Esign Genie is there SMS signing feature and customer service We have many clients who do not check their email regularly ,forget their passwords or just do not have email at all . Esign SMS capabilities stopped our need and lowered our expense of mailing out contracts . Our client sign rate do to this SMS feature is about 97% .< /text>< Pics>

I chose eSign Genie for the API features. For a one-man shop looking to automate steps to save time, this company was hands down the winner for me. eSign Genie support has always been spot on and helped me set up API integration with Lodgify & Zapier. Now my customers receive contractual tailored documents within seconds of completing an online transaction with another SaaS product. Even aer the documents are signed other SaaS products are updated and other workflows initiated.  eSign Genie is essential to my operation.< /text>

I've tried similar electronic signature platforms before, i.e. Docu***n. And for  my purposes, I have found that eSign Genie fulfills my needs and has features that I wanted, but did not find with Docu. Best of all, eSign Genie is a fraction of the cost of Docu. Frankly, the price of eSign Genie led me to try their platform, but the performance of that platform has created a loyal customer! If you are considering switching platforms, you should definately give eSign Genie a try.</review>

Our company has multiple locations around the state of Washington.  We are a non-profit that operates on grants so we need to provide signatures on many of our reimbursable documents like time sheets, expense reports, contracts, etc.  We used to have to scan and send documents for signature and then email back which was time consuming and inefficient. With eSign Genie, we have cut the time in half it used to take if not more.< /review>

I used to come here all the time but I noticed that they have recycling for the disposable vapes, not only that but the last few disposables were bunk.. the last two in a row died a day later and tasted NOTHING like label said. It’s too expensive to buy them here for way more than they sell for online! Only to find out they’re bunk!! Not happy! They were all grape tasting. Idk but it seems kinda fishy.. I either shop online or go the extra steps to Twisted Roots by McDonald’s it’s worth it to know ur getting a valid disposable. Just saying.<//Review>

Worst customer service. Saw the owner trying to fight a customer because he told him to put his mask up, customer put his mask up over his nose it fell down and he started yelling at him. Customer asked owner to calm down owner said he was going to take him outside and beat his A@@.</Text>

<text>Pretty nice place for everything smoking related. I went there to see what vape juice they had, and Paul was the guy that knows the vape juice. He is very knowledgeable about the juices. Not the greatest selection of mods if you are looking for that. But good selection of juices.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Stopped in today to get a bottle of e juice fully expecting to pay 20 bucks for a 60ml bottle but ended up paying only 10. The guy working helped me pick out a flavor (I’m a picky person). Unfortunately, I had accidentally purchased a bottle with no nicotine. I came back in to swap it out and they didn’t have that flavor in my preferred nicotine strength so I chose another flavor that happened to me more expensive. They didn’t charge me the difference for my inconvenience and even threw in an extra bottle. Very fair prices, incredibly friendly and helpful staff, definitely the best place to purchase vape stuff in the area. Highly recommend this place. Thanks!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>Tony and John really know what they are doing they treat everyone with respect where other stores don't. They are honest and their prices and products are great so if you're looking for a better place to buy smoking products this is the best on the Monterey Peninsula.

Liked this Subway. Wish they would supply their customers with a restroom. Understood their reasoning. But remodel so it's accessible by customers. No one wants to walk over over to another business while waiting for food.</Review>

Subway is a good way to build a healthy take out.  The vegetables are usually decent...the meat is another thing.  Out of necessity, the meats have to be pre-cooked, but it affects flavor. The cold cut meat should be replaced...it is not worth paying.  The overall experience at any Subway for me depends a lot on the staff.  Some are so much better than others, even if the food is just ok, the staff can make or break a decision whether or not a customer returns.< /review>

< Review>
Are doing for Chris light and his fellow crew of thugs that think their gods and can do what they want the most unprofessional people I've ever experienced and when they win an officer of the law that our community with points looks you in the face and lies to you that's just a bad cop there's good people and bad people and there's good cops and bad cops we should not allow our community to put up with these bad cops as these Sergeants do I am not posting pictures of what mr. Officer two-time officer of the year did to my car and I wonder why they don't have body cams on to record what they do no supervision when you let bullies run wild on the street even religious artifacts are not safe from being thrown in the trash<//Review>

Called the other day because I needed to file a report and the officer who called me back was extremely rude and not helpful at all. Your job is to serve and protect your community, yet someone from your community was calling for help and you treated me like dirt. So very disappointed.</text>

I've had multiple bad experiences with these "public servants" now. I called them to help with the theft of my store and I've had an officer call me and say he just drove around the building and didn't see anyone but I walked outside while talking to him and he wasn't even at my store,then I said well they're still inside my store; he told me he'd "turn around" and come help. Two hours pass then the customer walked out with store merchandise.
Every time I call for help they act very rude like I'm wasting their time just to get a simple no trespass order since that's what the police officers told me to do when I'm catching repeat thieves. This department is very lazy and refuses to protect and serve<//review>

<resp>None</resp><Review>In my personal experience with this department The lack of training in dealing with domestic violence, children, and special needs, needs to be addressed and more education needs to be provided. In my personal experience with this department it has made me feel uncomfortable uneasy and upset to think if something happens I have to call them. I strongly support law enforcement but this department would benefit from more program training in dealing with the public.< /Review><date>1568971347956<//date>< Pictures>

As fine a police force as you'll find anywhere. People in Citrus Heights go up to the cruisers to tell our officers how much they appreciate them. The story goes that when one of our officers asked a transient why he kept coming back to Citrus Heights, he answered that the police were so nice here. The chief of police has won the Paul Q Wilson award twice, which recognizes community policing. So proud of these men and women.</Text>

Got my fingerprints done there today for a background check. These are some of the kindest people out there. Building is also cozy and well kept. 10/10 would recommend getting arrested here.< /review>

<Review>I just witnessed a moment every citizen would appreciate. Not the sad arrest of a negligent mother, but the way the policeman handled the child in the back seat of the vehicle... as if it were his own child. He embraced the child with love and protection, putting the child at ease in a potentially traumatic moment. Bravo. Thank You CHPD<//Review></record>

Thank you officers for your quick response tonight. It was not an emergency situation, but I was happy to see you guys at our building when I called your non-emergency number to report after hour loiterers at the  Sylvan Oaks Library. People are uncomfortable returning their materials to the depository when there are people hanging out around the library building at all hours. There is vandalism on the outside of the facility, especially when people hack into the electric outlets and light fixtures to plug in their electronic devices. These "campers" also leave trash all around the building, which has to be cleaned up by the library staff, especially after Sunday and Monday when we are closed.< /review>

Typically I have had nothing but good experiences with the Citrus Heights Police Department.  Unfortunately, today has been the exception.  This morning at 6am my husband came out to find his car had been broken into.  We understand this is a small case, but there have been multiple car break-ins around the area and we have the description of 2 suspicious men in our area.  We were told that an officer was being dispatched to our home to dust for finger prints and make a report.  It has been over 4 hours and no officer.  We called once and was told they would be to our home within an hour.  When that hour came and went, we called again and were then told 'sorry our officer is on a bigger case'.  We are homeowners, tax payers and members of the community.  Pretty sure that our tax dollars go in part to fund our police.  Today, I can say that I am dissatisfied with with police response and based on this lack of response it seems the cars in our neighborhood will continue to get broken into and I guess we will all hold out hope that their crimes do not escalate to something more serious!</review>

<Text>Recently, I received a traffic citation from a Citrus Height's Police Officer. Like most drivers, I did not enjoy receiving the ticket. However, I must say that the officer was so polite that I wanted to invite him to my home  for my back yard barbeque that I was speeding to. Kindly, with a friendly smile on his face, he declined my offer.

Several years ago, guy had to give me a ticket. I made a right turn on red, had not been in area in a long time. Used to be able to turn on red. The cop was showing off for new recruit. My first ticket ever in my life of driving for 40 years. Really sad day. Stay away from C. H.< /text>

I LOVE them!  Whenever I have had to call about a suspicious vehicle or illegal parking or whatever,  they have responded!  I love having their presence in Citrus Heights and seeing them pull over people for talking on their cell phones.  I feel very protected living here.  Calling them about a cable issue,  is NOT the police problem. Call the cable company to report it!</Review>

I had a attempted break in couple days ago. Fortunately, I was home and handled it. Tonight, I requested a K9 unit to search my house because transients are still trying to break in? Did they leave or hide something? The CH Sheriff department very polite, respectful, and understanding after clearing my house. THANK YOU

These are situations we love and respect the police, why don't we EVERYDAY?</Text>

Citrus heights police department would not respond to a call I made regarding my upstairs neighbor who was also an employee of the apartment complex. I had seen a fiber optic cable hanging from their apt pointed directly into my unit. I than rented a scanner to detect further surveillance equipment which it did directly over me in the living room., Citrus heights PD would not respond saying " people don't do that in citrus heights." I suffered further trauma at the hands of these same neighbors/employee to the point where we moved out. This would have been prevented had I established this police report and arrest. The same employee than went onto make a key to my apartment and I suffered further trauma and stress. Instead of her being fired and arrested we moved out of the complex. A few months later I was harassed by an officer at a house we were living at down the street off Sunrise Avenue. The officer said he had been notified by neighbors that I was a squatter and said that I didn't belong there. I had to have the owner call him to verify me as a resident of the home even after I showed him bills with my name on them.< /text>

Second most unprofessional LE personnel I have ever dealt with.  If I witnessed a CHPD in distress, I would turn my head and walk, scumbags are on their own. Sac Co Sheriffs are a complete different story. I would go out of my way to help a sheriff.Would not surprise me at all if the populous started revolting towards CHPD and their Nazi mentality.

By the way, I had one experience with an Officer Jones whose conduct was  exemplary while conducting a traffic stop on me for speeding. Very professional, and personable.

Just let it be known that we have multiple videos and photos of questionable conduct just waiting for that right moment, and I cant wait for that moment.

I was in a car accident and requested an officer come by to write a police report. The dispatcher refused to send anyone over. I asked her about 3 times explaining that i need someone over and she responded that if there are no injuries we send no one. Consequently, my car has not been fixed from the damage due to both of us having liability and the other driver getting arrested the day after he hit me for drug possession. This happened all the way in MARCH! I have a hole in my car that looks like a shark bit through it! When i go to base its the laughing stock of the whole facility. Thank you CHP. I should've stayed in WI where they actually respond.<//text>

<Text>PERSONALLY, I HAVE ONE BAD EXPERIANCE WITH THE CHPD. I WAS GOING THROUGH A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE WITH MY KIDS FATHER WHEN I WAS 20, (I AM 29 NOW). THEIR WAS AN ICCIDENT ONE 4TH OF JULY @ 3AM , MY KIDS FATHER AND 2 OTHER MEN KICKED DOWN MY DOOR AND PROCEEDED TO GRABMY 2 BOYS OUT OF BED. I HAD A COUPLE GIRLFRIENDS STAYING OVER FOR 4TH OF JULY AND I YELLED TO ONE OF THEM TO CALL 911. DURING THAT PROCESS I WAS FIGHTING TO GET ONE OF MY KIDS AWAY FROM HIM. THERE WAS YELLING AND SCREAMING AND MY FRIEND HAD THE PHONE RIPPED AWAY AND DISCONNECTED IN THE MIDDLE OF SPEAKING TO THE 911 OPERATOR 3 TIMES AND THEY STILL DIDNT SEND ANYONE  OVER RIGHT AWAY. THE COPS DID NOT SHOW UP UNTIL 30 MINUTES AFTER THE GUYS LEFT WITH MY CHILDREN. THEN ONE OF THE POLICE OFFICERS HAD THE NERVE TO TELL ME, "YOU NEED TO TELL TE DISPATCHER THAT ITS IN EMERGENCY" REALLY? I THOUGHT THE SCREAMING AND THE PHONE BEING DISCONNECTED 3 TIMES WOULD HAVE EEN A GOOD SIGN ALONG WITH ME NEEDING TO EVEN CALL 911 TO BEGIN WITH. I KNOW THIS DOESNT SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE CHPD, BUT THAT NIGHT JUST HAD ME LOSE FAITH IN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>Sacramento Bee published an article stating the Citrus Heights Police kill more people than any other community in California. The Grand Jury results were that the traffic camera system is rigged. They only serve themselves and their profit. I avoid Citrus Heights when possible.< /Text>< Pics>

This is an amazing, secret find. I love Salvadorean food and they make it completely authentic. If you're not a functional hispanophone, it may be tough - I didn't hear much English (if any) but 100% worth it. They were patient as I muddled through my Spanglish and pointed at pictures on the menu.  Food was delicious and the ambiance was quaint. I will be returning!<//text>

My name is John, and I’m a online reputation management consultant right here in Waukee, Iowa. I may have even been in your business at one time or even worked with some businesses near yours. Here’s the Deal: I can help your Restaurant improve your online reputation. Your customers are seeing what others have to say about you before ever walking through your door and the bad apples leaving these reviews are ruining your  good name online. In fact, nearly 70% of your potential customers are consulting reviews and ratings before making a purchase decision. I’m sure if you had your way this isn’t how you would choose to represent your company on the  internet. I can work with you to suppress, directly answer, or in some cases entirely remove this negative press.If you buy my service, I can get you tons of legitimate 5 star reviews that will make your restaurant look like it’s the  best in town. Costs?I can offer you services from a simple one -time cleanup to an ongoing monthly reputation management  strategy. Whichever way you should decide to go, the costs involved are nothing compared to what this kind of negative customer-generated content is costing you every month.

(Translated by Google) It is a new restaurant but it is at the level of others around it, they are very restful and they consent to the customer with what is needed. The food is 100% excellent and its price does not exaggerate when charging people they are aware I hope they never change the quality of their customer service thanks small savior to the front and do not change

(Original)
Es nuevo restaurante pero esta al nivel de otros al rededor son muy hamables y consienten al cliente con le se necesita.la comida 100%exelente y su precio no exageran al cobrarle ala gente son consientes espero nunca cambien du calidad u su atencion al cliente gracias pequeño salvador para delante y no cambien< /Review>

<user>116924114817823620052<//user>< Review>
Ordered the fried fish curry. The curry on the side made the fish still crispy when it arrived which was nice and you could control the amount of curry. The popcorn chicken rice was yummy with a tea or soy boiled egg a bonus. The appitizer was popcorn chicken fried tofu and tempura. The tofu was seasoned well and i really love popcorn chicken the tempura im not a fan of but its just that type I dont like there was nothing wrong with it. Plan to get take out here again.<//Review>

<Name>QingQing Chen</Name><text>Been to the restaurant for sooo... many times, always being qualified by the food, drinks, and service! Sizzling platers and the sauce that come with it was so good! I got an sizzling NY Steak medium rare w/ black pepper and mushroom sauces, it was yummy. It comes with the salad and soup, the quality and everything was good enough for $13.99! The service was great as well, introduced new drinks, give advise and even warned me NY STEAK was lean, don’t recommend for medium well, will be chewy. For people don’t like to eat with blood, take you time to chewy.
For the drink I got the signature milk w/ boba & pudding, it was so tasty! And my friend got the sea salt foam Green tea, the foam was so good as well, recommend this place! Must try!<//text><user_id>108830463583530442939</user_id><Rating>5</Rating><date>1583976134078< /date>< response>

<Text>This place has been here for 5EVAR.

I've been here maybe 4-5 times at most though. More so when I was in high school because a lot of my friends were all Taiwanese natives and wanted to eat home food that wasn't too far away from school.

The most recent two times was with boyfriend and it was kind of late for Diamond Bar/Walnut and we didn't want to go too far. This place was still open on a Friday night. The interior and everything else inside is def old and could use a remodel or two (it seriously looks the same as it did when I was in high school and that was a decade ago).

I ordered their popular sizzling plate, black pepper chicken, but I opted out of the rice and spaghetti. Not sure if anyone realize just how little the meat portion is, I'm suspecting what you mostly get is rice/spaghetti because the chicken was tiny. I was actually quite disappointed because I've had this dish elsewhere with no rice/noodles and the meat portion had always been a good solid serving (size of the sizzling plate). Their chicken was maybe 1/3 of the sizzling plate, most of it was filled with sauce and grilled onions. :/ Definitely wasn't filling and a little too saucey for me (felt like I was mostly eating grilled onions with black pepper sauce).

There wasn't anything spectacular with the service, took our order, served us our order and that was about it.<//Text>< pics>

< Review>
They cant seem to commit to their closing time posted and have very confusing situation with the way they decided they are partially closed? And how they may or may not be willing to accommodate. Gone a few times at a still reasonable hour maybe around 8:30pm - 9:00pm (although they claim 10:30pm closing) and had this frustration often. Its very inconsistent and inconvenient, most places just CHOSE a closing time and stick to it and its usually at the top of the hour so that its not confusing or inconsistent and not just random intervals between that time as they see fit. This is a huge drawback.
Like if you wanna act like you are closed when the kitchen leaves then JUST CLOSE ALL TOGETHER AND FINALIZE IT AT 8PM AND CALL IT A DAY. Its a shame because the food and especially the drinks are more unique then your average Lollicup or Tenrens but i guess ill just spend money else where.< /Review>

<text>Good Taiwanese food at a low price. I had the lunch special which reminded me of bento meals from Taiwan, which came with soup and a beverage. The service was friendly and fast. I intend to return regularly. There is a small surcharge for credit under $10 per I think it is very reasonable.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

I've been here ever since I was a little girl as a local in Walnut. However, the last time went here with my mom the waitress was mean until she found out that we spoke fluent English. We also asked for a vegetarian hot pot, but it was made from pork broth so we got terrible stomach aches. We asked if they could just season the soup with mushrooms instead, but the waitress gave us a terrible attitude. She didn't even ask the chef. She just loudly and slowly replied, "IT'S PORK BROTH!" I also went there for their only real vegetarian food the first week of starting school at Mt. Sac. Their vege curry was artificially flavored, making my body feel swollen.<//review>

Went there a couple times, and usually goes alone. Every time they would ask the number of customer, that's the most basic. Then it takes them about 5 mins to get the menu, which I don't know why it takes so long to do that. There's not really a lot of tables taken, but the service is just slow. If the whole restaurant is full, then I understand. But five tables taken and there's two servers? Please, that's just not acceptable. And when the customer's done with their meals, they would either slide the empty plate aside, or they would just leave the unfinished food aside. With that, you should know that they're done. But no, you don't notice anything, and let the customers waiting. It took me about 20 mins to wait for the check. I was sitting there watching the servers doing nothing but chatting behind the counter while other customers are waiting for their drinks. If two people isn't enough for the job, then hire more servers, or just keep your eyes open.<//Review>< Pictures>

Great Taiwanese fusion food.  I go for the casual, fast service with clients. Nobody is ever diappointed.  I recommend the chicken or pork sizzling platters.<//text>

Food made me sick, then and there and made me throw up. The management's response was that I was lying and tried to charge me for the $7 sick soup.

I had to escalate the matter and the response was not paying for the soup, but to never return. Not a problem, I wont be coming back to this B graded restaurant.<//Review>

{'time': 1604981229782, 'text': '(Translated by Google) Thank you for your personal opinion. First of all, what you ordered was fried chicken chop instead of pork chop. We will check when the second meal is packaged. There is no problem. It is your business to use your teeth as a whetstone. If you have a bad mouth, you can go to the dentist. If necessary, I can recommend it to you. Furthermore, what you ordered is Appetizer, fried Taiwanese sausages. It is indicated on our menu (1). If you want to read it clearly next time, order it again, and our price is $3.50 instead of $3.99. Don\'t be mistaken. Deep-fried kidney beans are "fried". We do not sell "raw" food, and when we give you another meal, the green beans do not have the original packaging. Where did you see it "expired"? Is it possible that the supermarket is run by your home and deliberately sells expired food? In the end, normal people should have never eaten pig food. Of course, we have never eaten pig food, so I don\'t know how pig food is. Since you can compare meals with pig food, it means you have a lot of experience, and you must have enough knowledge and knowledge about pig food. Here is a statement: You don’t need to deliberately come to the business to find faults and retaliate. You also need to spend money to buy uncomfortable, why bother! No matter for whom or for what you deliberately slander us, we reserve the right to pursue your malicious slander and slander this time. We do not rule out that if there is another malicious slander and slander similar to this time, we will take any effective measures. Legal proceedings.\n\n(Original)\n谢谢您的个人意见，首先你点的是炸鸡排不是猪排，第二包餐的时候我们会进行检查，是没有问题的。您要拿您的牙当磨刀石是您的事，您牙口不好可以去看牙医，如有需要我可以给您推荐。再者，您点的是Appetizer，炸台式香肠，我们menu上标明了(1), 您要嫌少下次看清楚再点，以及我们的定价是$3.50不是$3.99哦，不要搞错。炸四季豆是“炸”出来的，我们不卖“生”食，以及再给您餐的时候四季豆并没有原有包装，你从哪里看到它“过期”了？难不成超市是你家开的，故意卖过期食品？最后正常人应该是没有吃过猪食的，当然我们肯定也不会吃过猪食，所以猪食是怎么样的我就不太清楚了。既然你能拿餐跟猪食做对比，那就代表很有经验了呗，那肯定是对猪食有足够的了解和认知了。在此声明：不需要故意来商家找茬报复，您还需要花钱买难受，您何必呢！不管你是因为谁 或者 为了什么 故意来诬蔑我们，我们对您这次的恶意毁谤和诬蔑保留法律的追究权力，不排除之后如果再次发生类似这次对商家的恶意毁谤和诬蔑会采取任何有效的法律诉讼。'}< /Resp>

(Translated by Google) The hard stone-like pork chops, are you using it as a sharpening stone? Sorry, our mouth is not so good. 3.99 Eight small slices of sausage, stuffed between teeth? Deep-fried kidney beans, the beans will linger after expiration, and pig food is nothing more than that. Come on, Ollie!

(Original)
硬的跟石头一样的猪排，您是用来当磨刀石吗？抱歉，咱牙口没那么好。3.99八小片香肠，给人塞牙缝的么？炸四季豆，这豆子过期都蔫咯，猪食也不过如此。加油，奥利给！</Review>

The staff were extremely friendly. Bakery items looked delicious. I had a hard time picking which items to get. I picked the cream puffs since that’s a Wisconsin State Fair favorite. Cream puff, cupcake and eclaire tasted amaIng. Everyone should go there!!< /Text>

<text>Really good coffee and food but long waits. Sometimes 15 to 20 minutes for a coffee. Love this place but very slow. The owner needs to hire more people or set it up better for workers.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Smaller shop compared to the Eureka locations but offers the same great coffees and delicious pastries and treats.
Best coffee and pastries/cookies in Mckinleyville!</Text>

I am totally hooked on their Chocolate Decadence Torte with the raspberry layer, and they put coffee ice cubes in their iced lattes  - awesome!! They have several good non-dairy alternatives, great scones and sometimes offer “second day” selections (always good) - I notice and appreciate the little things :) Staff  are always pleasant and go out of their way to be helpful - so glad the McKinleyville shop is open again, even if it’s take out only!< /Review>

< Review>
I enjoy the atmosphere, coffee and scones at Ramone’s, but one thing that really bothers me is that they  serve coffee in “to-go,” cups even when people are staying in to drink their coffee.  To reduce waste, I’d really like to see Ramone’s change its policy and use glass cups if people are staying there to enjoy their coffee.  That’s why I’m only giving them 4 stars.  Next time you go to Ramone’s and are staying in, PLEASE ask them to serve your coffee in a reusable, glass cup/mug.<//Review>

People are lovely.  We stop here first every time we go to the coast to run errands.  Actually I shouldn't be telling you this because I hate waiting in line.  About to order a birthday cake and will update (maybe).</review>< name>

<text>Substandard. I usually try to find the silver lining but it's hard with this one. Patrol one is a security company that my HOA requires for insurance purposes. But sadly there really isn't a security component. They come into my gated community. They look for vehicles that are parked outside of the garages in the community. Even residents are required to park in their garage. If you are parked outside you get a ticket to warn of the violation. You can "safe list" your vehicle a couple times or that of a guest. If you have a couple violations your vehicle may or likely be towed. Those are the rules. Safe list can be online but is not a guarantee....my two telephone calls were met with a bit of bad attitude...the security aspect doesn't really apply with this company. Essentially they are parking enforcement.... with bad attitudes and a communication online that is iffy.</text>< Pictures>

<pics>None</pics><text>The truth is that parking is the most contentious item with which most condo associations must deal.  My association was having an extremely difficult time keeping outsider from parking in our limited spaces. We also had residents who felt entitled to store vehicles in all areas.  Now all residents are allowed to park one vehicle in our open parking area and all outsiders are warned twice and then towed.  Our parking situation has improved markedly.  It is also true that some of our residents resent the fact that are not treated specially.< /text><name>Don Kolman< /name><userid>116884067484688232607<//userid><Gmap_id>0x80dcd96c47e76db7:0xe294adf67e564a06</Gmap_id>< response>

Had my vehicle towed from the complex that I live in.  So now I'm stuck with a $400 ransom because I need to get to work. Rude, unhelpful, horrible customer service that deflects blame. Go out of business already, and make the world a better place.<//text>

<Review>A parasitic company that leeches off of neighborhoods via HOAs. Loves to charge as much as possible whenever possible with no mercy. They don't care if its your car or not. The purpose of a patrol company should be to keep unknown cars off the street, not fine the people who live there as much as possible. They fine you 50-150$ per night if you dare to park your own car in front of the house you live in. HOA's work with these cancerous companies to make more money and it should be outlawed.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I live in gated community and my car was towed away at midnight.
$340.00 to pay, no call nothing to warn. And I have an account with all information included my #phone.
The WORSE website one can imagine. Worse people ever, too. Rude.<//text>

Been living at Resident community for 2 years, with the same car parked in the driveway & street. I understand to tow cars that haven’t moved.

But to car that they have seen in the drive way for 2 years and a few nights it has to be in the street so my daughter can leave for work in the morning out of the garage.

Have some common sense</Text>

This company is not good. I wish our HOA would get cut them off. They pick and choose who they tow and just drive by many car's not listed and get way more them there number of warnings if the person doesn't have enough time to do their job. Big community and 10 minutes to do their job is ridiculous. Paying for a company that doesn't work<//text>

Called in at 11:50 PM, to safe list my guest's vehicle and she knew who I was and all that because I gave her the community I live at and was asked the password and when I gave her the information, she tells me it doesn't sound familiar and so I told her again and she started asking me if it had any capital letters in it and I flat out told her that I would think she would know that by now and added, I don't see why this may be an issue because I never had an issue with this before! This is where she started having an attitude by raising her voice, saying she didn't like my attitude and I, in return told her she is the one with the attitude because I told her she was raising her voice at me and added I had been very cordial and respectful and that I was going to hang up which I did!  I find that this individual's attitude was cold, hostile, and unprofessional!  She obviously demonstrated very poor communication skills and this is not a way to treat people at all, especially, if they're in business!< /text>

The worst company in the entire world. Called them about a neighbor who doubled parked their massive truck and their motorcycle in one spot to the point that they were over the line and were about to scratch us and all they did is give no care and tried to tell me they don’t have a contract to do anything about it. Yet I’ve seen them two countless other cars in the community at night. Or maybe it’s just when it’s convenient for them that they decide to do their job. Laziest people in the world, and the rudest from countless experiences. If you own a property please don’t hire these clowns.<//review>

<text>Awful customer service. Louisa hung up on me.  When I called back she would pick the phone up and hang up again. I called back three times and she did this. On the fourth time she just left it on hold for 18 minutes. All to try and safelist my own vehicle. Appalling. So discouraged for our community that we have such an awful patrol service representing us.<//text><gmapID>0x80dcd96c47e76db7:0xe294adf67e564a06<//gmapID>< user_id>

<Review>The guard said he called the tow company to move a car that was in our spot. After an hour and a half and it now being 4:20am, no tow truck arrived. We called the towing company and they said no one ever called them even though we signed off on the paperwork. After a ton of phone calls the issue still remains.

I spoke with James on 7/14, who is a representative at Patrol One. I called in order to safelist my vehicle. He was very rude and end result hung up on me. I understand policies are in place, however, I feel customer service was extremely lacking. I do not recommend Patrol one in the slightest. Very unprofessional.<//Review>

<text>We moved into our new condo at Rancho Del Marr located in Temecula California at the end of September of this year. Since moving on site at the property patrol one has asked us to change all vehicle registrations to match our new current address, they said we cannot have any PO boxes or any other addresses on our registrations. Even the vehicles that are being parked in the garage at all times they forced us to change. Since our registration is valid on all three of our vehicles, we had to pay a $22 fee to change the registration for each vehicle. We also went into AAA and had the registration Changed but that was not up to the expectations of Betty the worker that was helping us.AAA does not charge a fee to charge her registration, but the DMV does. So now we are out $66 and our parking issues have still not been appropriately addressed. I would like to be considered for a reimbursement payment on my dodge challenger, I just went and paid $22 today to have that registration updated per your demand. I have also received a parking citation after being told my vehicle was safe listed. I assume from the reviews that I’ve read about your company this email will be ignored.This is not how business is handled, the homeowners association for Rancho Del Marr should seriously reconsider their business with patrol one.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

This company is a joke. Have lived in the same residence for the last ten years, and all of the sudden they change the call in process out of nowhere. Not only do they barely provide a service of security, but they go out of their way to tow cars to get their kickbacks. I’ll absolutely be filing a complaint with my HOA.<//review>

Very lazy!  I live in Newport Coast within a gated community and all vehicles must be on a safe list witch my brand new car is we did it the second day I brought it home.  We have email after email clearly showing this is the Vin.  Well the Top Flight Security was to lazy to get out of his little Corolla and check the Vin so he had it towed on this fine beautiful Saturday morning.  In return I had to pay $500 to get it out of the tow yard.  The response from the security company was we make mistakes all the time sorry.  Well that's not going to be good enough for me.  See you soon Patrol One.< /review>

Patrol-One is the most unprofessional organization I have had to deal with.  Their customer service is abysmal.  I have already spent over 20 minutes on hold, call 4 times.  Phone is answered and immediately put on hold, even after trying to put in the specific extension of our "rep" Fallon Paquette.  Tried going straight to customer service spoke with someone, I felt like I was wasting their time, they decided they didn't want to deal with my problem and put me on hold for another 14 minutes before I hung up.
Once I got a live person, it's not about customer service but them telling you how you screwed up or didn't do something right, even when their system is not intuitive, logical or helpful.  Horribly unprofessional company and unfortunately as a resident, I don't have any choice in having to deal with them.  Possibly why they don't have to try.< /Text>

Horrible customer service, this company has zero interest in being helpful to the people who live in the communities they sign up to patrol. Very shady company as well, they will work out deals with H.O.A. board members to not punish or tow their cars while strictly enforcing rules for everyone else.<//Text>

This company was hired to patrol my community. Their service is horrible, but better than their customer service. In the time they've been employed by my HOA, I've never actually seen them in my community. If you report issues to them using their website, they send security officers days later. If you call them, they are rude and unprofessional and still send officers days later.<//review>

<review>If I could give zero stars I would. The worst security company ever!! Don’t know how they’re in business. They don’t respond in a timely manner and are heartless people trying to make a buck. They left several citations on my daughters truck which I had paid the permit fee but apparently they needed another piece of information to confirm the application. However, they failed to inform me that that’s what was holding up the authorization even when I called three times asking what was still taking so long! Of course they didn’t tow it on a weekday when you can get it out of the tow yard. They wait til a Sunday morning when the tow yard is closed!? Wow!! I wish our HOA would fire them right away after reading all these complaints!

<review>My HOA recently hired Patrol 1 to manage parking in our neighborhood. We are still in the warning period and nobody has been towed but i feel the need to save another community from dealing with this incompetence. Getting this company on the phone is next to impossible and when you do they either dont know what is going on or are rude. They take forever to return calls or emails and you often get conflicting information. They left 2 notices on my Mother in laws vehicle, one claiming the car isn't safelisted (it is) and another claiming that it appeared the car was being stored on the street. My mother in law drives her car on average about once per week to the pharmacy or store, and has disabilities but it is NOT being stored. We are currently on hold (25 minutes and counting at 9am) to get an explanation AGAIN even though they have confirmed our cars are safelisted twice previously. The representative has now picked up (approx 35 minutes) and called my husband a liar until he cited an email cc'd to them as proof. There appears to be a culture of bullying callers and poor customer service and if you check the message from the owner on the website, you will see it comes from the top. This man appears to have a loose grip on the actual laws but seema to hope his attitude will stop people from advocating for themselves. A few words of wisdom;

TO HOA's you have an obligation to choose an honest, fair and at least pleasant company for the people, the HOMEOWNERS who pay in to allow you to hire a service. THIS IS NOT THAT COMPANY. I am not saying this as a person that has been towed or has a bone to pick, so you can trust my review.

TO PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING WITH THIS JOKE OF A COMPANY.  Follow up all phone calls with an email detailing the call you just had, because they will lie or play dumb. If you can, download a recording app and let the person on the phone KNOW that you will be recording the call for your owns records and would that be okay. If they don't consent, insist on an email confirming all details discussed and if that is refused, again send your own email confirming details of the conversation.

In closing, I would NOT recommend this company to any HOA and will be brinig this up monthly to my HOA and sharing it with friends and mommiea on my mommy groups, some of which are on their on HOA and can prevent from hiring this company to begin with. RUN, DON'T WALK AWAY FROM PATROL 1.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Very rude. FAQs on website detail that they do not have to produce anything to demonstrate violations given. Just their word is sufficient. They ordered my car to be towed after one violation. I discovered my car was towed about 30 minutes later. Call tow company and I'm told it will be $516 to pick up on the same day (j&m towing on Hamner). I called Patrol One to inform them I only received one violation and they say they issued two. With violations left on windshields, I can understand a small piece of paper can fall, much like a small piece of paper can fall with the safelisting number .... Why is their word alone sufficient and not the resident. Why is J&M towing able to charge so much for their service (rep at tow company said a regular tow is $75)?<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

This company serves no purpose other than to scam residents. I  put my car on the safelist at night and woke up to no car as it had been towed, it cost $300 and has not been reimbursed. Maria and Christina are extremely rude and not helpful and lack all human communication skills. Next stop BBB and small claims court.</Text>

<review>Patrol one is a theif and crook company.  I'm taking them to court for towing my car without any warning.  And against my apartment policy . I have to pay 285 as a cancer survivor with 7 kids and was in the hospital a day before for high fever.  My daughter was trying to leave for college and couldn't find her car. She woke me up and I called patrol one and asked to speak with the manager and she was very rude and told me my car had no parking permit visable and there was a past warning back in February 18. I told the manager that per the agreement of my apartment gou need to give us a warning every 30 days and it passed from February 18 to March 25. The patrol one manager argued that from February 18 to March 25 was only 28 day.  She couldn't even use a calculator to find that it was 35 days. I called the Santa Ana Police and I took an incident report and I am for sure taking them to small claims court .</review>< resp>

You dont say there is nothing i can do if i paid you money for permit. Please educate your employees. Your employee just told me to park outside of the property if i dont feel like it. I would bust your head open. Sounds like someone doesnt like working there. Fire them.</Review>

They patrol my apartment complex and they have they're own assigned parking spot but for some reason he thinks it's ok to park in the visiting parking when it's almost impossible to find an open parking space, when he's assigned a spot for his bucket of junk that leaks oil everywhere. Since he was parked in our visiting parking spot, I parked my car in his space. Before he left at the end of his shift this morning @3am he gave me a citation for unauthorized parking, so my car could be towed away. I would go out of my way to say hello to our security guard and offer him cold bottle water, even offer him a plate of food when I would BBQ. He knew that was my car, plus my freaking front door is less 25 feet from the parking lot. $2,750 a month and still goes out of his way to get your car/truck towed away!!! This is straight out wack and scandalous, I would never recommend this company to guard anything or anyone!!!! 👎👎👎👎💯🖕💯<//text>

If I could give them negative stars I would. Patrol One works with our condo complex to regulate parking in the complex. That would be fine if they actually followed the rules. If you live in the complex and you have more than two cars to fit in the garage you are required to buy a sticker for your window. Patrol One has towed my brother's tow more than once WITH his sticker in the stated area of the windsheild. I also get warnings on my car even though I have the sticker for over a year. They never refunded us for the towing of my brother's car and all they said was that the sticker was not visible enough. They have terrible customer service on top of it. The website is always down so putting your car on the temporary list is practically impossible but if you don't put your car on the list by 10pm they will more than likely tow you.

If you are looking into an apartment or condo complex or anywhere else that contracts Patrol One to do anything I would run far away!<//Text>

IF THERE WAS A NEGATIVE INFINITY RATING, THATS WHAT I WOULD GIVE. My vehicle was towed from my personal property, from my own garage. Yup, right from my driveway. My association Action Property Management told them that it's my right to park in my OWN driveway. Patrol One 1) doesn't read the rules, 2) are THIEVES WHO WORK HAND IN HAND WITH TOWING COMPANIES LIKE TOWS RUSS TO STEAL CARS ILLEGALLY< AND THEN CHARGE THE CAR OWNERS $$$$$$$$$ TO RETRIEVE THEIR OWN VEHICLES FROM JUNKYARDS. MOST DISGUSTING BUSINESS, NO REMORSE, FLAT OUT THIEVES. If anybody is drafting a class action suit against them, count me in.</review>

Zero stars AGAIN.... seriously our cars are safety listed permanently and they continue to put notices on them. We have a new car and it’s safety listed and they put two notices on it and SCRATCHED IT ... employee was monotoned and could care less when I called this morning. STOP TOUCHING MY VEHICLES.. still extremely unprofessional and RUDE.. ZEROOOOO STARS!.... they where caught by my camera system leaning over my brand new car to put a parking ticket on a car that had a handicap plaque up... and the guy scratched the side of my car.. BUT because I can’t PROOVE. Other than the video of him leaning on my car they won’t do a damn thing! The Manager was snooty and rude wouldn’t transfer me to her Manager. I hope our HOA terminates then come February! DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM AT ALL! They are extremely rude and unprofessional PERIOD<//Review>

Zero stars. Patrol-One towed my car despite being "Safelisted" in my community. When asked for a record of my call, which "was recorded for quality assurance," it couldn't be found. I'm out $300 and no way to ensure they won't do it again. Don't let them into your HOA!<//review>

Dirtbags. My vehicle was clearly marked with a permit and they claimed it was not viewable from their guards angle of sight. People should come together and file a class action suit against these dirty crooks. They protect nobody, they are simply a money hungry company obviously paid off by the towing companies they use.</review>

<Text>If i could give negative stars I would. They are the worst patrol ever, and maybe the most useless. I would rather trust a guard dog more than them. They towed my car for being parked there for one day. No notice no nothing. They just towed it. I call them and they say "there is nothing we can do, we can't bring ur car back" Unreliable unproffesional and straight up thieves. They work with the towing companies to tow cars even if there was no violation. I'm sure they can't even find their ass. If there is a lawsuit happening count me in.</Text>< gmap_id>

It's a nightmare dealing with them. Took forever for them to pick up the phone, said someone else was on the listing as current tenant so I couldn't safelist my car. Excuse me I am right here sitting in my unit. If I am not the one why am I paying rent every month? One of the agents basically hung up on me. 🙄️ the worst.</text>

However, they never provided notification and when trying to explain this to her, she basically said the conversation was over and was going to hang up.  She is the rudest individual you will ever meet.

They had our car towed (a resident) with a note and copy of the lease in the dashboard on the night I had to drive my wife to the hospital to give birth to our second child. The placard said 72 hour parking and our car was parked for less than 5 hours.

They left the unregistered white truck double parked in the alleyway.

They let drunks hang out all night by the dumpster.

But they can sure make paying customers/associations miserable.

Michael who answered the phone could care less.

Associations, if you hire this company be prepared to get complaints.<//Text>

<review>These guys are a complete scam artist!! They are in cahoots with tow truck companies ( Coastal Towing changed to OC towing changed to IT Towing after so many complaints and lawsuits) They only tow cars nothing else. They dont monitor properties for theft, noise disturbance or anything else. They dont follow HOA guidlines and rules. They have towed my vehicles twice and this is the final draw after OC towing now IT Towing has caused well over 6k in damage to my vehicle. See you guys in court.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Yeah, this is pretty much the worst security company out there... they rival the TSA in stupidity and lack of common sense.

I have experienced the most incompetent and unhelpful security guards in the Casalon (Quail Hill) community than any professional security service I've ever known.
They often sit parked on their cell phones, do not provide a secure community, are rude to residents & homeowners and have very bad attitudes.
They must have some arrangement with Beach Towing because they are quick to tow and harass residents. This review is on behalf of the community who supports this post.
As a homeowner, if you leave on business for 4 days, you will find your car towed even if you are parked correctly.
Management needs to be reviewed and this company needs to be investigated. Something is not ethical and this company is going to face a heavy backlash from residents who will no longer tolerate paying high HOA fees for this kind of service. Absolutely terrible service and this company should be avoided.
They are not operating in the homeowners best interests and causing residents heavy fines/ fees from illegal towing.<//text>

All I see is ppl complaining about a security company that does there job. Incase you haven't noticed its against the law to tow a car without a warning. So they obviously do there job cuz they have given me warnings in the past and I respect that they are doing there job so I move my car and not do something stupid again. So technically I do give this company 10 stars if I could cuz they do there job.< /Review>

This company has cleaned up our neighborhood of vehicles illegally parked and discouraged those parking in the street just to keep their driveways clear and their garages full of junk.<//Review>

There rude and tow anything they can find. They changed our policy without any notice so now we can't even park where we live. What's the point in living somewhere when you can't have family or anyone park safely without getting towed. It's ridiculous!< /Review>

<GmapID>0x80dcd96c47e76db7:0xe294adf67e564a06<//GmapID><Name>Lia Borja<//Name><text>(Translated by Google) Of the worst, be careful and have an emergency and leave your car in front of your open garage, with open doors yetc. because they don't care that they see a fireman in front of your house and take your car, arrogance first and foremost. Bad service if you speak on the phone and you can never finish filling out your application for a "safelist" permit because your website is obsolete! bad, bad, bad, bad. And to my misfortune we already have many years with this pseudo-service.

(Original)
De lo peor, cuidado y tengas una emergencia y dejes tu carro en frente de tu garage abierto, con puertas abiertas yetc. porque no les importa que vean un bombero en frente de tu casa y se llevan tu auto, prepotencia ante todo. mal servicio si hablas por telefono y jamás puedes terminar de llenar tu aplicacion para un permiso de "safelist" porque su website es obsoleto!. mal, mal, mal, mal.

Small little corner store that has everything you need. Has a large selection despite its small size it has fresh mexican sweet bread, hats gloves wallets and a little of everything else. I was surprised how many things this store has, good customer service as well<//review>

<review>The user-friendly capabilities of my MW2 dashboard is my favorite. The reputation management is astonishing. I get to see important statistics at the first glance of this dashboard. Especially the listings. The listings I think are the most remarkable statistic with count on citations and even mentions. Thanks so much MW2!👍< /review>< user_id>

They also helped us migrate it from an old domain to a new domain, optimize the website for SEO and refine our social media and blog. When we pushed the new website live, we saw a great jump in rankings for some of our biggest keywords. We are very proud of the new website and online presence. We greatly enjoy working with MW2 Solutions and highly recommend them to others.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Have had a great experience with MW2l Solutions since day one. I've worked with them for 4 years now and also sent them many clients. My favorite part is the constant innovative marketing initiatives they take to stay ahead of my competitors. Lately they even go over the weekly reports with us on the calls. 5 stars! Great results.< /Review>< Pictures>

Not only are they experts in their field, but they cut through the wasted time I've experienced with others. I went from needing a partner to launching campaigns on multiple channels in weeks. That would have taken months with other agencies. Beyond the unbelievable launch process, they have grown with my team and continue to provide expert advice. I highly recommend working with Mark and MW2.</Review>

<user_id>110617868586022177730<//user_id><review>MW2 taught our company that to be successful on social media you need to post a nonstop stream of relevant content and engage with customers across all social channels, for each of your clients. But that is way too time consuming and why we never could do it consistently. MW2 gives us a custom dashboard that not allows give us custom content to share based off of our target market and keywords but we can post to all platforms in one place and schedule posts out for months at a time and then put them on cruise control! Our following has increased at least 20x since we hired them.</review></record></dataset><record>

The most hands-off experience. They set up my custom MW2 Dashboard right from the start, their social media team help me get all synced and now I can handle it all in one spot and see reports of how I’m doing. They have saved me so much time and money and my business has grown by over 35% in just 9 months.< /Review>

MW2 took the time to explain every moving part of our digital marketing when I had no background in it. MW2 pays attention when it matters, not when it’s just complicated.<//Review>

MW2 Consulting has been a great asset for my company. Before we started with them, nobody could find my business or know how to reach me. Over the course of the first 90 days of doing business with them, we saw an exponential growth to our client base and have been pleased well beyond that on the results that we’re getting. I attribute our growth directly to what they have done for us in social media, SEO and mobile marketing. They do exactly what they say they will. Glad they were referred to us.< /review>

<review>We got here about 20 minutes after they opened. Only two other lanes were bowling. Only one staff member on site so there was a lot of waiting around for a lane and for food. It was fun, though, once we got everything set!

They didn't clean the lanes between uses until more staff came, so best to come at 5 pm when they'll be able to sanitize the area between different parties.

Could be cleaner, there were areas that had dirty footprints on the lanes, but with the limited staff they did the best they could.

Value for money was okay for bowling these days. We'll return at a later time but before league which came in around 6 pm.</review><Resp>{'time': 1621025715289, 'text': 'Hi Jen, the health and safety of our guests is our top priority and we’re so sorry to hear this.

Didn't have to wait long, lanes were ok wish there was more seating area at the lanes. And was pricey. Paying per game per person and $5 person for shoes.. Has a bar and billards and arcade for the kids  put prizes are not the best. Did an open tab for drinks but waitress only came by once and we were done playing when she finally came back. Didn't try any of the food.< /review>

I have to say, I'm pretty impressed! I have lived in Buena Park my entire life and have driven by this bowling alley soooo many times. I never went until Thursday night with some friends.
It's a really old bowling alley. My grandparents bowled here in their younger years so you can't expect it to be fancy at all.
The rates of their prices are awesome! It's per person, per game and the price fluctuates depending on the time you go. The great part about paying per game though is that you can take your time. The place I usually go to is by the hour so you have to bowl fast. I have my own shoes bit I think my friend said the shoe rental was $5.

The bar is open and you can order food. However everything is fried so if that's not your thing, eat before lol. I'll be back !!!<//Review>

< Review>
Today I did a series, a photo essay, if you will. I was walking, and then I stopped. I recently moved to Fullerton, so I wander. It was depressing, though. How would Mr. Lebowski feel if they took away his right to roll? Walter would be livid, I can tell you that.

It was a lonely place on this, the first day after a hellish nightmare that lasted a whole year. Let's pray that those marble looking Brunswick balls roll again, and the monkeys 🐵 get their jobs back setting up the pins. We've spent too long in the gutter. May all our 4 10s split ☮️</Review>

They have servers who come to your lane to take your order for you. I think they try and help you if they’re around just because they’re nice.< /Review>< Pictures>

This spot has been a local spot for me. They got bowling of course, arcades, pool tables, and bar and pool table area for the adults. Restrooms are not the greatest but cleaner than other places. The employees were helpful and keep checking up on you for drinks, food, or game set up. I would recommend checking when they have specials through out the week.<//Text>

<Text>This place is great, good prices friendly service... it makes me.feel like forest gump, but Jenny keeps trying to kill forest and he never seems to notice in this parallel universe version. And the moral of the story is that stupidity and honesty pay off in the end, as you long shut your eyes run fast and hope for the best.< /Text><user_name>keithen77</user_name></record>

< Review>
Just had my daughter's 15th b-day party here and couldn't be more pleased! From the get-go, the planning and event was amazing! Used their website to plan the party - it was super easy and I was so amazed at how affordable everything was. When we arrived, I was even more impressed with how the party was set up! There were tables with decorations, a personalized lighted sign with a birthday greeting, and the party associate, Vanessa, couldn't have been any nicer! She and Adriana, our server, checked on us frequently to see if we were pleased and having a good time. The manager even came by to see that we were being taken care of! The kids had a fantastic time; bowling, video games, food and fun...what more can you ask for. I was so happy with how everything turned out. My youngest daughter even asked if we can go back for her birthday. I highly recommend having your next party here. We will definitely be back. A hidden gem indeed.< /Review>

I needed a ball in a hurry and their pro shop (Parkins Pro Shop) had such a great ball driller. His name was John English, and his knowledge was incredible...he not only drilled my ball, he explain some corrections, in my grip, that I didn't even know about. I used it that day in my league, and won a side pot for the first time.</review>

<Review>Old bowling alley. So if you're looking for an authentic place that's been there since the beginning of time Carter Lanes is for you. If you blink twice you'll miss it cuz it's right off the freeway. It's not bad for a $6 beer what do you expect at a bowling alley? They are there to make money off concessions that's the only way they remain in business so keep that in mind bowling is still fun who doesn't love to go bowling especially Rock and Bowl they have a great rock and roll there.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>Came here for some bowling and a drink or two. It was a fun atmosphere. People in the lanes near us were nice. We were able to have a conversation with some random people. Employees could afford to put a little pep in their step. Had to ask for a lane reset 3 times when the machine racked them wrong. Not a big deal. I'm sure I'll keep coming back. The rates have gone up recently or something though, I haven't gone in at least a year but I remember it being like half what I paid this time around.<//Text>< pics>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>We attended my friend's daughter's b-day party last year.  It was so pleasant.  We ended up hosting our daughter's birthday party on 9-12-17.  Our waitress Destiny was super nice and very prompt with all of the food/drinks we ordered.  The Manager Jonathan was amazing.  I would say every 30 mins he would check on us to make sure everything was going good.  It was a busy night so it meant a lot that he took time out of his busy schedule to check up on us.  Not to mention most of our guest arrived very late.  The manager added some free time to our bowling.  Like I said AMAZING crew at AMF Carter Lanes.

My kids loved it because they paid for it. And enjoyed every minute of it. There hard work paid off. The whole family had fun the price was very good for rentals of lane and shoes the music is loud but not to the piont that you can not hear. I will take them again and this time to eat and i will try to check out the Tuesday special. Hope this helps.</Text>

<review>The place is a little dated in its decor,but the staff is great! I usually go with a group of friends for college night on Thursdays(thier website has more info on this). They have special deals for practically every day of the week! The bar always has any drink I ask for, the food is standard bowling food (pizza,nachos,fries..etc). They also have pool at this location there's always a free table, with two in the bar area and 4-5 behind the register. Overall this place is a fantastic place for families, friends, and even league players to go to.< /review><Name>Melissa Smith<//Name>< Pics>

Fun place to visit for a work outting. Bar prices where fair. The main negative is how short staffed they where before 6pm.<//Text>

Been on a bowling league there for over 11 years. They have remodeled and painted inside an out. It's to bad that they haven't put more money into fixing there bowling machine's. Always lanes breaking down, or your ball gets stuck back there, an it comes back with a nick or scratch, some times the pin setting is off to, (missing a few pins, on your first throw.) Now that they blocked off customers from eating in cafeteria, we have to wait longer for service girls to come down to take our orders. Poor girls are running ramped. (Need more, servers during big bowling leagues playing). Oh an a BIG THING never fixed entire 11 + years I've been there, they have never fixed the girls bathroom sinks. One side only drips water, other one is a little better, but not by much, which ever side your on, the soap is empty or broken, so you have to run to other side to get soap or hand towels. So yea your walking with your bowling shoes on, now bottoms are wet from drips on bathroom floor. You gotta be careful bowling after that, you can slip and fall, or it stops you from gliding when you throw the ball.... Food prices are high $, but isn't any place, movies, bowling, park attractions. Etc.....
Other wise I love my bowling league family.<//Text>

< Review>
Bowling alley is way too out dated for the price.  At $6.50 a game I could go to almost any other bowling ally in Orange County and get a better deal.  The place looks like it was last updated in the 60s and is in desperate need of new equipment.  The only reason I will go back so because of Ramon in the Pro Shop, he is very knowledgeable and friendly to new bowlers.  Has great deals and can custom drill your ball to your hand.  Unless they update their facility or drastically lower the price, I will not be bowling there again.<//Review>

To spend some time away from food focus events,  and to get a bit of exercise as well as use your brain,  yes I said it, we went bowling.  Strategy on how to get the pins down.  Technique is key but so is jumping up and down with a spinning pin not sure if it wants to fall or not,  sure helps... not really but it's fun trying. Great way to spend time with love ones. #datenight #familyfun</review>

Has bowling, pool, and some video games. monday through thursday are discounts on bowling. Pool is $10 per hour. My only complaint is that bar was closed earlier in the day and there was no way to even get a coke while playing a game and no snacks either although pizza, wings, drinks are advertised. I think it gets busy on the weekends. Weekdays are good time to come to beat crowds. Staff are friendly and helpful.< /text>

No frills bowling alley. We had a good time but the place lacked atmosphere when we were there. It seemed understaffed and the poor girl that served us, and who was incredibly polite and helpful, was running around doing everything including drinks on her own.< /text>

Clean lanes, pool tables on the side and a lot of parking. They do have a cafe and bar and a designated family area on the right. Always have events going on like Summer VIP 3 games every day of summer for $55.</review>

My, how much this place has deteriorated over the last decade. Went in for a practice session and was shocked at the condition of the house. Approaches looked like they haven't been replaced in 20 years, and the machinery was filthy to the point I had to clean my ball in session for it to maintain its effectiveness. The kicker was barely 5 minutes after completing my prepaid games, having another group come down before I could finish packing up. Disappointed would be a vast understatement.</review>

<review>Im giving it a 2 because the balls kept getting stuck.Not a Very good Variety of balls.The sizes.Also complained & was never moved or seem like the problem wasn't being fixed throughout at least the 2hours we were there.There was also an extra lane open rite next to us.We were a Party of ten with two lanes & our other half of the fam played double of wat we played because of the stuff getting stuck & having to wait for the only ball I could fine to fit.For eveybody on our side.Kept having WAIT FOR THE BALLS TO COME OUT & IT TO CLEAR.Seemed also like I got somebody's shoes that had just played.They were damp & had an Odor.But otherwise we tried to make it as fun as possible.Next time we are going somewhere else.<//review>< pictures>

It also happened to be league night so there was a 45 minute wait. We played pool for a little bit in the room behind the registers which I noticed was a little drab and needed some fixing. The ceilings were peeling in some places, as were the walls, and it definitely could use some new lights. We finally got a lane, played 2 games and called it a night. I feel like the  lanes ckjkd use a little update but overall not too bad and the prices weren't too crazy either.< /text></record>

Without a doubt one of the worst managers that I ever dealt with in this industry. I ask for the regional manager's name and contact information and he refused to give it to me. I get he has a lot to hide but this is completely unprofessional. There are issues with this house that I would like to address and I have no response. The manager's name is John Smith.

<text>Liked AM Carter Lanes but bad experience with front desk when l. I was sent a  $20 coupon. Bowled 4 Games and 1 pair of shoes. 4.49 per game X 4 $17.96 plus 1 pair of shoes Minus the coupon I should have been charged  $ 2.25 I was charged $17.96 and Only discounted $5.00 on a $20 coupon. Very poor business practice and I just signed up for online member ship that morning. The attendant was argument I've and Also charged me a game when My nephew has a Summer pass . I was shocked the The Company sends me an online coupon abd the attendant made up his on rules. Really enjoyed the Bowling alley the lines but he ruined the good experience we had up until that point.

the place is not classy.  Overall clean but a bit dated.  Great deals for bowling on fridays after 5.  The food was surprisingly good for a bowlung alley.  They could use more waiters - there was only one lady helping all lanes-  i will go back.</Text>
