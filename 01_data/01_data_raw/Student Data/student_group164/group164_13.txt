<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I purchased my first firearm here over a year ago, simply because I saw an add online and they had what I wanted for a excellent price. That was the best decision I could've made. The staff was informative, helpful, and kind while helping me through the process. Since then I have purchase numerous, firearms, accessories, and other items from the shop and every encounter has been beyond stellar. The staff is sharp and welcoming, the store is always tidy and hospital, and it's genuinely just got a really great vibe. My favorite Gun store by far.</review>< Time>

<text>Have bought a handful of guns and other items here. In my opinion, hands down most friendly and knowledgeable staff I’ve dealt with. No question is a dumb question ( even though it may be), and if the person you are dealing with doesn’t have the answer, they find someone who does. I definitely do a majority of my shopping at Redding Guns, and will continue to in the future.</text>< pics>

Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. I pop in here and there just to BS with these guys from time to time. They get alot of good stuff in as well. I was able to score a CA legal Keltec sub 2000 from them during the height of this buying frenzy. If you're looking for a new firearm definitely give them a look. If you don't see what you want on the shelf they can probably order it for a great price.  Can't recommend them enough.<//text>

<review>I was looking for a super rare gun for months. I called Redding guns late 2019 asking if they had come across. They said that it’s probably not going to happen anytime soon. Sure enough just a couple weeks ago (05/2020) they called me to tell me they had one on consignment. Keep in mind, this is a super busy store that would normally have no problem selling this rare piece. Needless to say, I now have it and I am super grateful to Tyler and his team. They are VERY professional, knowledgeable, and just easy to work with. Prices are very fair too. I’ll be going back here for any FFL related stuff for sure.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< gmap_id>

Redding Guns is the quintessential small family local business with a knowledgeable and courteous staff. Don't let the words "small business" dissuade you, Redding Guns is anything but diminutive when it comes to their variety of firearms and accessories. We have purchased several firearms from Redding Guns and refer all of our friends and family to them for their firearms questions and needs. We weren't surprised when they won the Best of Redding Award for 2016 in the gun shop category. We highly recommend Redding Guns to anyone looking for a one-on-one shopping experience that can't be found in the larger sporting goods stores.< /Text>

I had the pleasure of purchasing a firearm at Redding Guns. The staff is very knowledgeable and I paid less for the same gun I found at some of the other shops in town. I would recommend Redding Guns to anyone looking for great service and great prices.<//text>

Tyler & Rob are the best. I drive 228 miles from Hayward to deal with them. Have purchased many items from them. Even when I made a mistake, they fixed it there on the spot.

< Review>
This is Darla, the old manager of Deli Delicious #18 on Ashlan and Blythe. I would really like to apologize to the people I offended by having a baby in the shop and not wearing a mask on those days. I wasn't thinking as I was left with my abandoned grandson and couldn't find a sitter, also I didn't plan to be there as long as I was with him.. again, I sincerely apologize to you!!< /Review>

I've lived in fresno for almost 10 years and been a loyal customer the entire time but I'm done. I've tried to go to the location on Ashlan 3 times now in the last two weeks and they've been closed every time! I get that they had reduced hours because of Covid but other restaurants are opening back up so why aren't you?  What restaurant closes at 4:00 on Sunday? I don't know how you stay in business.</review>

< Review>
My wife forced me to do this because she would be very upset if did not. A more surreal incident took place a little over 3 weeks back. I am a certified CEN in the medical field. Furthermore with the incident , a young man , an employee, had seemed to have passed out in the back of the store. I was in the store while this all took place. Suddenly you hear him screaming his fellow co-workers  name; over and over. The young man was in the front , totally ignoring his injured co-worker . It completely angered me . I’ve seen cases as such and him not helping the injured young man did NOT sit well with me. The young man was on the floor in the back for minutes and minutes pleading for help. When I looked in the co-workers eyes as he was working WHILE this young man was well on his way to possibly losing his life, he looked like he was under some serious instruction. Smh. It’s not right. I love that shop but I will not allow myself to eat at a place where they do not take care of each other. There was a lack of leadership and it was not the employees’ fault. Do better guys.<//Review>

<Review>Great sandwich full of meats and sides. My son says their fries are the best in town-nice and crispy. Only reason it loses a star is that 4 lunch sandwiches shouldn't set me back over $40 (no drinks)</Review><UserId.>108314538692393083526< /UserId.>< Pictures>

<rate>1</rate><Review>This location is the worst place to go. Customer waited over 35 mins for there order & was only 2 sandwiches & a soup which that did not even have for them.  I waited 20 plus minutes & then was told the soup I ordered was not available after waiting so long ask why tell me this now & not before when I ordered the soup. The 35 min. customer had the same issue.  Paying $5.00 for soup they did not even make or get ready is out right wrong . They did not want to refund us the money only said sorry. After this issue I ask for the Main Manger & ask for our refund . They only refunded the soup, & the excuse was where new we didn't know after the fact. Plastic containers all over the place floor was covered with food & trash, dirty. Place should be shut down for the Health inspector .. Do Not Eat Here. Will be a mayor lawsuit if you got sick.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Super slow today Darla left two of her employees alone when they got busy. She didn't lead by example by washing her hands when leaving cashier area touching everything and didn't wash her hands after she told another employee to do so poor services today!< /Review>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>I’ve been hearing a lot about management and the maltreatment of the employees and i’m starting to think it’s true. As a person who operates and runs a local food business I could say that I was utterly disappointed in the lack of cooperation the manager had with her employees. I came in one time and right as I came in I did not feel welcome nor did it look like the manager wanted to be there. It was during lunch hour and the employees who looked young and probably are young kids where working their a** off while their manager was sitting at a table doing nothing to help or be productive. I feel bad for the people that work there. deli delicious is a great franchise company and this place gives it a bad image. disappointed to say the least and I hope corporate does something about this soon.< /review></record>

<rate>1< /rate><review>They are super unorganized and do not keep the location clean.  It took them over 30 minutes to complete my order because they misplaced my order and because they didn't have already prepared tuna mix and had to make some more.  Additionally they let people inside without a mask.  Not ok especially because of the current Covid-19 situation and the fact that's a requirement for businesses to stay open.< /review>< Pictures>

Maybe it's just me, but I bought 2 half orders sweet  potato fries and 1 full order beer fries. Fries are now served in a paper-like envelope. Half order filled
one-quarter of the envelope = 14 fries and full order filled one-half of the envelope = 18 fries.
I used to look forward to the fries and didn't mind the up cost. But I didn't get the quantity for the cost.

I currently work here and it’s true. I am emotionally DRAINED from this job. I’m only 19 and I’m constantly involved in the management’s drama. I come to work to do my job and ONLY my job but something new happens everyday. Being talked about, being mean mugged, being talked to horribly & treated unfairly. @Brian Luna, I thank you for speaking up first about her “talks” of the employees while in the shop. I’m one of the 5 she talks about. @Cedric Williams I especially want to thank you for bringing up that incident. The boy that passed out on the floor is my boyfriend. It’ll be a month in 2 days and nothing has been done or spoken about by the management. I am very hurt and disgusted with this, with everything. There’s is a lot more I could go on about but I’ll stop here. Thank you guys again for getting the word out.</Review>< Rating>

<review>Usually my go-to place for sandwiches. Today though I was quite disappointed. The meat was sparse on my sandwiches, but seemed to be abundant on a group that the employees seemed to know. Kiki was also quite rude and impatiently took my order. I only know her name because the group I mentioned before hand referred to her by name.< /review>< pictures>

We drove past a couple times as the entrance is set back a little on the deck. The staff was great with information shared and selection was superb. Found what I had been looking for, for years!! Shocked, excited and happy with our purchase, even though its on the higher-end price wise. If its something you love, it makes you happy and life is easier to manage because of its medicinal benefits....the small cost increase is not only okay but acceptable because no one else has it!</Review><UserId.>108247295361577663931< /UserId.>< username>

<review>Helpful very knowledgeable staff. My favorite among the 4 or 5 shops in the area. In my recent visit 3 days ago, they had a table set outside where you can peruse their products. They have curbside pickup for online orders. Or you can call them if you need assistance with your orders.< /review>< Time>

Well stocked and clean convenience mart. There is a subway sandwich shop inside also. The employees are nice, fast and helpful. Even when its super busy, which it is often,  they get people in and out of there rather quickly. The gas is always cheaper than the Chevron right across the street.< /Review>

I meet with friends this nice place often! This is my favorite spot to pass a nice evening.  I go to this spot routinely. The food is excellent, the staff is helpful and the charge is reasonable. I enjoy being in this restaurant over a tasty meal.<//text>

This place never gets my order right. It's so bad, I started to blame myself for their shortcomings (I told myself it was my fault  for not checking my order before walking out the door). On this particular day, I ordered teriyaki chicken and sweetfire chicken. I got orange chicken and plain grilled chicken with no teriyaki. I am very unhappy with the lack of customer service/satisfaction provided by this particular branch.< /review>

Yesterday was the first time we came to that good restaurant. But It is definitely not the last. We had a good time with the efficient service, with the first-rate  cuisine and wine and with the honest pay. We will definitely return there again.</Review>

Order dinner for my wife/parents/in laws. $60.00 worth of food was broccoli and walnuts. Where’s the beef???!!!! And where is the old shrimp that has been sitting under a heat lamp with the coat peeling off and in the bottom of the box. Just sad and pathetic really. Thanks for disappointing my family and myself. I live right near this restaurant and probably won’t give it my business after this. Sent a complaint to corporate to see what they choose to do and will make an update accordingly.</Text>

<Text>This place used to be a good one but with the time typical business mind kicked in and now I have noticed they are serving very less in the bowl. I took pepper chicken and found I had 4 pieces of the chicken and rest were just celery and onion. Also, noticed the guy who was serving, Looks like they have instruction from owner to maximize the profit. The serving tray had merely the content for 2 people and he easily served three in front of me and all I can see was left over celery and onion. We are not stupid to pay you 7 dollar for that celery and onion. I know the TH school is almost closed for last 7-8 months and your income is impacted but that doesn't mean you start doing unethical work.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><user_name>Sanjay Shahi</user_name></record>

< Review>
Like others have said, food quality, order accuracy and portion sizes have diminished over the past few months. I ordered on-line and they were paying more attention to those going through the serving line. One  of my kid's meals was totally wrong (they gave us two of the same kid's meals but not worth it to go back to the store) and the chow mein was very full of cabbage.  One of our orange chicken bowls barely had any chicken.  Understand things are challenging during Covid but need to maintain quality control now to sustain your business in the future.< /Review>

<user_name>Lauren</user_name><Text>This place has taken a turn for the worse. They've adopted a severely reduced menu with equally reduced food quality. They also now don't give refills or free samples, making this an overall poor value for low quality food.

They've also adopted corporate policies that make no sense. They've decided that giving away free food is a risk to my safety/health. But somehow paying for it makes it safe it eat! This particular location also now only employs sheep who follow these policies without questioning them. The result is poor food quality, lack of care for customer satisfaction, and overall very poor service.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I don't usually stop at this Panda Express, I eat at the one in RSM. I really like the food and that it is quick and easy. I was in the area so I stopped here on Saturday afternoon for a late lunch. The orange chicken is always good and I also got beef and broccoli. Both were fresh made, they were bringing out hot new bowls to replenish the supply. The orange chicken was tender spicy and tasty. The broccoli was just perfect avd a generous helping of beef. Wow a great lunch. This Panda Express is also very good. Good friendly service and great hot food. Highly recommend</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Gmap_id>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>This is one of the better Panda locations.  Food is always fresh and delicious.  Occasionally,  like tonight, the wait for a dish is 5 minutes (usually it's just 2). That could have been because there was only one cook this time. Price is reasonable and parking is free.  They are located at the end of a strip mall.< /Review>< Pictures>

Don’t even bother ordering online, it is much faster to go in and wait in the line. I ordered my food online and told me to be there at 6:10. I was there when I was told to be there and waited ten minutes past my time while my food just sat there in the back while they helped those in line. The guy did offer me drink, but all I wanted was my food to be ready and not cold when I got it.<//review>

Food is ok but the two entrance doors slam incredibly loudly everytime someone walks in. They could easily take care of it by hiring a repair man to fix/replace the hydraulic door closer.< /review>

Waited for over 20 min for the cook to make fresh string & chicken. Not cool when price of place went up a lot. A lot of onions and very little chicken.

Average food. Line is ALWAYS too long.  You need to specify that you want them to make the order when you place it over the phone, not put your order at the back of the line of orders when you make your way to the register to pay. It'll take another 10 minutes. 🙁<//text>

I have gone twice now.
One time, I was just before closing.  The girl counted the people behind me, and devided the portions between us. My order was half of what you get at other Pandas, I walked out!
Being it was late the first time I thought I'd try a second time long before closing.  The portions were small!!  Half of what other Pandas give you.  The cashier could not understand how to make change, after I gave her change to get a bill back and no change.
I will not be going back!!< /text>

< Review>
So I always get my cream cheese ragoons with my meal. The girl ALWAYS rings it out in a way that makes it harder to remove an item if I don't have enough money on my card. That happened today. I wanted her to remove the ragoons but she had to go find her manager to completely scrap the order and redo it. Heres the catch: her manager WASN'T EVEN IN THE STORE!! She had to go outside and I stood at the register for close to five minutes. I didn't even get my food because she too long. Another thing, the employess don't seem to want to be there. They have a bland expressionless face that makes me feel unwelcome.< /Review>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>It's Panda. Always great food. But the robotic service is terrible. "Can I offer you a sample", "Any eggrolls or wontons", "Would like to donate". After years of service, the same lines still come out of their mouth. I absolutely find that type of service dissatisfying and inauthentic.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dce98833fd8759:0xa2e8f3b7c26fd8ef</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Megan was supet helpful. She gave me the back history of the fridge and was very knowledgeable. She was patient and even took the time to clean off scuff marks from the fridge. She was also very accommodating with the delivery time.< /text>< pictures>

After looking for a washer for over a week now, I found one on Facebook. I contacted Simply Appliances and they were very friendly and helpful over the phone as well as in e-mail messages. I was able to make go over the agreement via e-mail and make an over the phone purchase. My experience with them was great, well over what I expected, that after going to pick up the washer I also picked up a dryer. Definitely do recommend Simply Appliances. Keep up the GREAT work !!<//Review>

First, their customer service guy (CHRIS) looks like a baby thug who dresses and talks as if he just got out of continuation school. Immediately upon entering the store, he was very rude, condescending and arrogant. As if he owned the place and used it as a cover for his drug business and couldn't care less about the appliances or those customers who came to purchase them. My father just died and my family is struggling, so to make a $1k dollar purchase on a refrigerator that didn't even work is a joke. This "appliance" business is a joke and a scam, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!< /review>

We did order a part, however, you failed to call us back for 3 months, even after multiple attempts to reach you, and, in that time, all warranties by us and the part manufacturer expired."}< /response>

Sold me a defective refrigerator. I paid to have it serviced 3 times for the same problem. Now it’s worse than it was when I purchased it. They refuse to take responsibility for it. Avoid this business.<//Review>

This is the first negative review I have ever written.

The used fridge we purchased arrived with a broken thermostat. We've had warm food for a week, which is fine, a risk we took buying a used fridge.

A repair tech came to look at the fridge (no charge per 30 warranty, awesome!) Unfortunately he entered our home without a mask. When asked very kindly, even apologetically, to put one on tech responded that he never wears a mask, and doesn't have one to put on.

I called the company to ask if they were aware they were sending unmasked techs into peoples homes. I spoke with Chris on the phone who said yes, they were aware. Yikes!

It feels extra hypocritical because they have a "Covid-19 Policy" of only dropping off the used fridge OUTSIDE of the house for the safety of employees. Call me cynical, but it would seem that this company has used Covid-19 as an excuse to save time and labor when convenient for them, but doesn't actually care about the health of staff and customers.

So, again, if you are into unmasked strangers entering your home, this is a great company to work with. If you care about personal/public health, not so much.</review>

All employees within our company have been reminded of our mask policy, including Chris who is one of our newest employees. That being said, our delivery policy has always been a drop off service only. It is not something we've changed or diminished due to Covid-19.

Awesome prices with a cheap delivery fee, great customer service and very clean store. Best and easiest experience I've ever had buying a refrigerator. Their warranty is great too, and hassle free. I'm happy I finally found an awesome used appliance place!< /Text>

<Text>We just moved into a new house and our washer went out. We quickly called Simply Appliances and spoke to Rachel. She was very friendly and sweet. She let us know they do a 90 warranty. First 30 days is they’ll swap out and piece and do the repairs, after that the rest of the 60 days is 30% off. And they also do a 10  day swap out if we don’t like our product for just a $35 charge. Thank you for being so fast and hopefully this refurbished washer works for us.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Went to look at fridges at Simply Appliances yesterday, and I don't know what the people on here are talking about when they say the employees had "great customer service". My husband and I walked into the store and the worker lady made absolutely NO eye contact and never even asked if we needed help with anything. There were a couple people there that the lady helped, and after they left, she just completely ignored us. Never did she look up once from her register. We were going to make a purchase, but since she pretended like we didn't exist, we walked out after looking around for 15 minutes! This is too bad because the customer service was trash and she had absolutely no customer service. Would've rated them ZERO STARS if I could!!!<//review>

< review>
I ordered a whirlpool washer and dryer set for a nice price here on a Monday or Tuesday. I get a call the day of my delivery on Thursday or the day before to be notified that during the technicians inspection my dryer is missing a lent trap, so what else am I to do but have to deal with their not checking sooner. They order the part and due to Covid I'm now having to wait to receive my part later than a few business days for it to ship. The salesman sold me used rubber hoses for $6, used doesn't equate to not useable at all or broken. Hoses should be good for about 4-5 years rubber , I figured those weren't  good at all to begin with and she sold it to me anyway; she sold me defective hoses that I couldn't use at all; water shot everywhere. After writing the manager I explained the lent being missing, her reply was she'll contact me when the lent trap is in. Ma'am to make things right out of good faith you should at least have someone drop it off to me or mail it to me. The hose were bad, lent trap missing what else? That's like selling a bike with no tires, if things were missing to the machines you had out on hour floor then why have it out for sell.Thank God you have a job everyday and this doesn't happen to you. Good luck in the future with your business.<//review>

<Text>Don't waste your time and money. I bought some appliances and the washer was broken from the very beginning. The charge you to go there. I can understand but we weren't available to be there at the time. Also you never mentioned about extra charge if we missed the the appointment. We running STR Business in by law because the Covid-19 we can't get access to the  property if our guest don't agreed. Also I went to buy another washer and I explained to your worker about the issue but I didn't have the receipt because was inside of the property. The lady that called me was really rude and had actitud at the phone and asked me for more money because we missed the appointment. We have 50+ properties and love to have connections with locals small business because normally the service is better. I'm really sad it turned that way.<//Text>< username>

<Name>Dean B<//Name><Text>They always do perfect repairs. Took my Sabre here a couple of times and the prices are very reasonable, the repair work is consistently great and done quickly. Never any follow-up issues. Other shops fix one thing, then break another. Also, brought in my Bike today because the foot-shifter was loose and the dude helped me out on spot and fixed it for free in 5min. Highly recommended.<//Text>< user_id>

New rider with my first bike and I took it here Saturday morning to get some help to install some aftermarket frame sliders, GPS tracker, and fender eliminator. NO PROBLEM AT ALL for the pros who work here. Got it back the same day and even received some lifeprotips for the bike and for me as a new rider from Brian. Absolute top notch service and will definitely be my no. 1 spot for any service in the future.< /text>

I should have brought my bike here first! I recently purchashed an 87 Honda XL600R . Ran great for 50 miles then ignition system failed. I replaced nearly every component down to the pulse generator which happened to be the culprit. Brian checked out the old one for free and that's where the problem was. Brian and Luis always took time to answer questions and were fair and upfront about any work estimates. Highly recommend Honda of Glendale! Thank you!< /Text>

There was some confusion around holiday hours, best assume they will be closed on any holiday Saturday.
It threw a pretty big wrench in my plans but Brian was very apologetic and my VFR800 is purring again. I definitely plan on using Honda of Glendale for future service and suspect this will be a 5 star rating eventually.<//Text>

<review>I brought my '98 Valkyrie in for valve stem replacement on the front wheel. Brian the mechanic also noticed that the back one was bad and was happy to replace it even though I arrived within two hours of their closing time. He also noticed a shifter seal leaking oil and called me to see if I wanted him to change it. Again, he could have had me come back another day but since I live about 60 miles away he completed that repair as well. The prices were fair and I am beyond happy with the service and the way I was treated. I will definitely make the drive there anytime I need repairs on any of my other Hondas. Thank you Brian!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I bought my second bike from here in 2018 after taking 7 years off riding. From purchase, to returning for maintenance every few months, to having my bike stolen and sent here for repairs, this place and the family that run it are top notch.

I rarely write google reviews, but for a place where they are consistently friendly and courteous without a hiccup, I think they deserve one. Brian has really honed his craft to pure perfection and I would look nowhere else for the best advice.</Text>

As a new rider I was pretty nervous and hesitant while shopping for a bike. I was really put at ease by the entire staff at Honda of Glendale, and especially by Brian, who was incredibly patient, friendly, informative and helpful while I came back multiple times, asked a thousand questions, hemmed and hawed, and was not sure what I wanted for a long time. Brian gave me zero pressure, zero "upsell", only excellent, patient advice -- and a GREAT price on a new bike, with much less dealer fees than any other places I was looking at. When I finally purchased a bike, I didn't feel safe riding it home through rush-hour traffic -- so Brian agreed he would deliver it to my home on his flatbed the next morning for an incredibly reasonable fee. Everything about my experience here was excellent. Brian also gave me several very welcome riding tips (lane position, etc) that I still think about every time I take a ride.< /text>

Brian the "owner" is a complete joke.  He has absolutely no customer service skills and plays games.  I called him multiple times over the last two months and asked if I could put a deposit down on a new bike.  He informs me the bikes aren't in yet and he will call me as soon as he gets any information.  I have called and left my info with Brian personally and today I was informed that they sold the bike to someone else less than two weeks ago and they won't be getting any more in.  His lackadaisical attitude towards a $4,000 transaction is appalling.   I have shopped at this location for years for everything from spark plugs to tires and they have lost a loyal customer today.
You should be a little more humble and apologetic and less argumentative with prospective clients, especially in this market.< /review>

I have also contacted Honda of America to inform them of shady business practices.  I'm pretty sure the "owner" sold the bike in question to someone he knows...and just didn't wanna man up to it.  Instead he blamed it on the "girl up front"...

Unprofessional owner, took 2 bikes for service. One needed a valve adjustment and the other one didn’t. The owner which is also the mechanic is in a rush all the time, he is not focused on the instructions you will tell him.. as a result he ended up doing the valve adjustment on the bike that did not need it and charged me for it.

Also the common scam that a lot of places do including this one is to sneakily damage the innertube And tell you that it wasn’t their fault. The bike was at their premises when it got a flat tire it was perfectly fine when I brought it in. Ended up changing it and charging me for it without even a discount.

Never taking my bikes over there again with dealerships you’re either very happy with the service or very unsatisfied and unfortunately with Honda of Glendale has been the worst experience for me. Their tuneup he’s not good cleaning and lubing the chain a 10 year old would have done a better job.</review>

Brian and his team at Honda of Glendale are honest, reliable and the prices are absolutely fair.

As a daily rider I have to be able to trust my machine and one of the most important ways to do that is through professional maintenance.

When I have any work done here I know it will be done right the first time.

Excellent quality of service, no BS and fair prices. Couldn't ask for better mechanics.< /review>

When I used to live in Montrose I was working on my 75 cb550 and had some issues on it after getting all of the engine reassembled and all that. I gave him a call, he said to ride down to the shop. I roll up, he pulls out a mechanics stethoscope takes a listen and gives me tips on how to better set the tappet distance and so on. All for free. That earned my respect for him forever. He’s worked on my bike and got it in perfect shape and has always done the best work. I know, because he puts the same attention to detail as if it’s his own bike. I recently got some new Pirelli tires for my 14 cbr 500 and he gave me a great deal on them and set them up quick. Honestly don’t even read any more reviews. It’s wasting time that you could be on your bike and getting more miles. Just go here and tell Brian “thank you for existing”.<//text>< pictures>

got me a Badass ruckus from that spot.. Brian Storm is a great, and so is the family.. great shop to buy a bike. ride-or-die!!! .  I have been riding this RUCKUS for 5 years now and it is a great product... Buy from this family owned business.... Once again,, Brian and his crew do a great job taking care that customers are helped. Always with a greasy hand shake.. and a fair price... And a fair deal... Ride it. Go Honda strong.. keep up the great work. Thanks again.. almost 10.000 thousand miles on a  ruckus. And I go no where else..</review>

<Text>The folks at Honda of Glendale provide some of the very best customer service I've ever experienced. I took my 2014 Honda CTX700N for its 8K mile check-up, and Luis (front counter) and Brian (mechanic) took great care of me and my bike. This is the first time I've had my bike serviced since I bought it used at 6.7K miles, and Brian's the only mechanic I'm taking it back to—he's got it running better than I've ever felt it run. The prices are reasonable and competitive, and their work is top-notch. I highly recommend Honda of Glendale for your Honda bike's needs!</Text>< Pics>

I gave Honda of Glendale a shot after the North Hollywood Honda location closed. I was pretty nervous, knowing it's difficult to find honest mechanics.

Never had any major problems/breakdowns on my '00 Fireblade, except of course usual wear/tear. I keep my Gem maintenanced, and never had the same problem for what I brought her in for. Prices are fair, and with the work they do plus outstanding turn around times, can't complain and well deserved.<//review>

Brian Strong went above and beyond to diagnose and repair my 1986 Honda CH150 Elite Deluxe. Parts were not easy to find but he and his parts specialist managed to find everything needed. Having such a rich knowledge from years of experience along with an honest desire to serve their customers makes Honda of Glendale a cut above the rest. My Scooter has never run smoother or been more fun to ride. Thank you Brian!!< /review>

<Response>None< /Response><review>BEST SERVICE IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY!!!
Brian is the best.  He listens, and his his explanations are thorough and easy to understand.  Brian knows everything there is to know about Honda Motorcycles.  A 5 minute talk with Brian completely restored my faith in Honda Motorcycle.  My first was a 1989 Hurricane in 1994.

My 2014 Honda CB500X was losing oil, and the color looked off, at just under 5000mi.  Temple City Powersports, where I purchased the bike, had no explanation for the symptoms and were happy to charge me $98 to check for leaks. If they did not find any, I would owe $98 for them to tell me what I already knew; it's not leaking.

Brian explained why I was losing oil and that the color was nothing to worry about.  It's only 500cc, and riding it at 6-7k rpm on the freeway, at 75-80mph will cause some oil loss.  I happily paid $70 for an oil change, because I knew it was in good hands.

Bert's Mega Mall tried to charge me for a Valve Clearance Adjustment at the first 600mi service.  Over $200 more than the proper service should cost.  They did not check to see that the Maintenance Schedule has changed, but I would have paid for their oversight.

Honda of Glendale has good prices for their new bikes.  You can't go wrong here, if you own a Honda motorcycle.< /review><user_name>K. Moore< /user_name>< gmapID>

Nice place compared to some other motorcycle dealers in the area. Never got pushy during the sales process and pretty straight forward with maintenance. I called Brian telling him my bike felt "off" since I brought it in last and he told me to swing by so he could ride it and take a look. Pointed out my chain tensioner was off and adjusted it for me in a few minutes, and I was on my way. Nice people!< /Review>

Was having issues with my bike I bought brand new from here. Well that was a mistake. Mechanic kept saying it was me. I took it to another honda dealer and the clutch was totally out of wack unadjusted and the accelerator gas line. I honestly expected more but its ok Im just glad to be alive and glad I found another shop that cares about me enough to have my brand new motorcycle in operational condition. Its jist sad that I remoeved my 5 star review saying I love my bike for this. Beware<//Review>

My discussions with Brian about the bike are spot on and he is a straight talker. Some things cost more because they are more complicated, and I understand that. He's also done some troubleshooting and corrections that would have taken me a long time to figure out that has saved me a bundle. I go to this shop because I trust them and they do good work. They don't recommend things I don't need to do and do a mechanically great job when
they do. The only issue I have now is that the shop is now getting busy because of good reviews...but I am happy to give credit where it is deserved. Thanks Brian.<//Review>< Pictures>

I had taken my bike to pch power sports with the same problem I took it with to Honda of Glendale.  Pch blew me off. Honda if Glendale immediately and without fuss got the whole of Honda's problem solving team on it and we're really clear about timelines and good about calling me with updates.  I'm massively satisfied with them and highly recommend this wonderfully managed and run shop.< /Review>

My daughter blew up her CR 85 over New Years. I contacted Phil in parts who helped me order everything I needed and had it there the next day. I sent my wife in to pick up the parts and while she was there Brian cleaned up they cylinder while she waited. Great customer service!<//Review>

<Review>I just bought a 2013 Honda CRV. I love my car and had a great experience at Glendale Honda! Jay, the internet manager, helped me to find the color I was looking for at a great price. Not only was he helpful with my purchase, he also picked me up at the Mini dealership the next day in Studio City where I dropped off my lease. He also checked in with me a few times since buying the car. That's above and beyond! Based on my experience with Jay and the rest of the team I definitely recommend Glendale Honda!! Happy hunting!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Gmap_id>0x80c2c10e6c767a7b:0x1eda558dc61757fc</Gmap_id>< username>

• Prices were honest.
• Work was done quickly and efficiently.
• Vibe and a welcoming atmosphere improved over past visits
• I will be back again

**Update**
December 2017
It was the first time meeting Brian today, who was pleasant to deal with over the phone yesterday and had an appointment wide open for me today.

Dropped off the CBR for an oil & filter change plus brake flush. To my surprise Brian had me in and out in just over an hour. So kudos on that, considering most shops don't have that kind of turnaround. Of course it all depends on the workload of the shop, and so I consider myself lucky today.

The vibe and experience today was a night and day difference in comparison to the other times I have stopped in at the parts department. Luis was in good spirits and Lamon was a hoot. I suppose it's all in the company you keep which can lend a difference to the atmosphere one makes for its customers.

Additionally, I was able to take a walk around the showroom floor and chat it up with Brian. Lowdown is he's one of the owners and the shop has been family owned since the early 80's; it's always good to be able to support local businesses.

Upon pickup we discussed some adjustments and minor tweaks to get more performance out of the motorcycle and better longevity out of the motor.

Prices were reasonable for the work and time put in on the motorcycle; it didn't cost me an arm or a leg. And Brian did make a suggestion for going with a higher performance brake fluid, but was not pushy about it which I appreciated on both fronts; both for the performance recommendation and for not being pushy about it — subtly is key.

All in all, I think I will be back. And I would like to be a repeat customer as long as the consistency in service is there and I feel like I am met with honest work along with a second family and home for my bikes.

I am not sure where the shop sits with the riding community, but I could see a future wherein the shop plays host to a club or host their own events & rides to increase visibility and engagement within the motorcycle community — especially amongst Honda riders. That would be amazing.

I've never been a fan of their parts department. Customer service is just not their thing.

I never felt welcomed at the location when dealing with the parts department in person or on the phone. I have always felt like I'm inconveniencing them or that they have better things to do with their time than to deal with customers.

How does this inspired confidence in me, especially when I need some service done or better yet, when I am in the market to purchase a new motorcycle? It doesn't.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Went to get an oil change, rear tire mounted, and check engine light inspected. The staff from Sales, Parts and Service departments were very friendly and courteous.
Knowledgable and quck service staff. Brian (Bryan?) Serviced my bike and he was a pleasure to speak with. He was very understanding and gave me great customer service even though i had severly neglected my bike with regards to maintenance. Definitely recommend this place and will be going back for my next service/maintenance needs< /Review>

Expensive, worth it? I think so, basically if you actually want it done right, come here. 6th, maybe 7th set of tires  I'm buying. I've never had tires actually balanced till I got it done here. They know their stuff for sure and test your bike afterwards too. If I were to get anything done, these are the people to go to< /review>

I use to like this place but for some reason I stopped going here at this donut location, one of the reasons is because I usually find myself very uncomfortable coming here now since I feel that every time I go in there one of the Chinese women seem to ignore me and they just act as if they don’t see me knowing that I’m standing there waiting for customer service.  The Chinese woman is just moving the coffee pots left and right and moving the cleaning cloth pretending  that she’s cleaning she’s basically just ignoring me I don’t know why and it’s been two times already that I noticed that they are slow to attend the customers and the donuts are just cold and stale I like them nice and warm don’t like this place very much no more.<//text>

La Donut is by far the best donut shop in Anaheim and most of the O.C. Every time my family and I buy a dozen from La Donut we are amazed at their consistency. They're always fresh and delicious. No exaggeration. We've tried all of the classics and have never been disappointed. Their price is usually less than $9. You just can't beat them. They only accept cash and have an ATM inside for your convenience. Well worth it!</Text>

A nice family owned donut shop. The earlier you come in, the more variety you will find.

Location: The location itself is within a small plaza off of Anaheim Blvd. Parking is a bit limited, but not too much of a problem.

The Food: The Donuts here are really good. They also have bagels, ice cream, ham and cheese sandwiches, coffee, hot chocolate, and anything you love from a classic donut shop. Their cake donuts are amazing. My personal favorite is a pink donut they have with white icing, delicious! The owners always give free donuts with any donut purchase. A dozen is about $6 and a large hot chocolate is around $2.25, which is huge.

The most important thing to remember when visiting this donut shop is that they do not take credit cards, ONLY cash!

Overall good donuts, the owners are sweet, and good selection.<//review>

<review>I don't really have much to rate them on. I've only stopped in once on my way to work. Got a donut, it was good. Lol
They do have relatively inexpensive sandwiches/breakfast sandwiches, I haven't tried them yet though.</review><user_name>Gerald Oliver</user_name><GmapID>0x80dcd6304b6feb1d:0x65f621a737399893<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Great Fresh Donuts and Delicious Breakfast Sandwiches...And They Serve Boba. Your usual donut shop with fresh, big donuts, but also make great breakfast sandwiches. I find myself going here because it's well worth the money versus going to McD's, Carl's, and Jack for breakfast that leaves me unsatisfied. For about the same money, or cheaper, you can get sandwich like you might make at home. Whether it be on bread, bagel, or croissant (the best way and most filling) and if you want ham, bacon, cheese, egg, AND chile or any combination of those, you could pay anywhere between $3 - $6 dollars. Usually takes a few minutes for them to make it fresh. No "pre-mades" under heat lamps. Believe me....its worth it.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dcd6304b6feb1d:0x65f621a737399893< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>This site is my favorite restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I like it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to this restaurant. when  I want to go to a good dinner, this restaurant comes right away to my mind. good and varied  food and a rich cuisine.helpful crew, and pleasant mood. In addition to that, the tariff is reasonable. I suggest this spot with great pleasure.</review><Gmap_id>0x80ea698c7998f52f:0x2a8a96e47d8d3268<//Gmap_id>< Response>

<Review>We went to see a show on Friday the 13th. The show was great but there was a guy at the table next to us who seemed to have a stroke. The staff there responded swiftly and got him the attention he needed while also calming the crowd around him. They were so professional during the whole thing that I would just like to give them the attention they deserve. Thank you to our waitress who saved that guys life by helping the Dr in the crowd and getting whatever she needed. Thank you to the President of Stars who was also there to tend to him, and when the firefighters and ambulance people got there, he calmed the crowd the best way he could: swiftly and professionally. Thank you to the actors who I'm sure didn't know what was going on but dealt with the surprise intermission, and afterwards, kept going on like it was planned that way (and most of them were kids too!) Great job all and thank you so much!</Review>< Pictures>

We go with a group of friends regularly and always have a really good time. Food is always good and the shows are professional through and through. Oh did I mention how funny some of them can be... Humorous or not, we always have a good time!< /Review>

Everything was awesome and the play was good. I only have one complaint.  My tickets said the show starts at 6:00 p.m. however that was untrue dinner started at 6:00 p.m. not that show.  But that is a minor irritation and nothing worth dropping a star for. The actors are awesome and they always have a quality act< /review>

If you want good food a belly laugh a great cry and all around experience, invite friends and go you won't be disappointed. It did take a little long to get the food out. Other than that it was the best time ever it was worth it.<//text>

Recently experienced this place for the first time and was amazed with the venue. Had dinner and watched Prisilla Queen of the Desert and it was one of the best ever. Really happy this town has a gem such as this one.</Review>

< review>
Lunch approximately $8.50 for two item with lo mein and a drink.   Noodles tasted not so great to me, chicken and sweet sour pork wasn't too bad.   I have been here about 5 times. Very filling and has a variety to choose from.  Arrive early because when lunch time ends at 2:30 the food looks like it has sat around for too long</review>

<Text>I worked here for 6 years,  and I definitely say this without bias, this is one of the fanciest most expensive dinner tickets in town, great choice if you're a socialite. Make sure you stick around to mingle in the lounge after the show, and meet the cast!</Text></record>

Good food. Good price. Good service. No indoor dining due to pandemic. Either pickup or use Postmates. Definitely following COVID19 guidelines. Support local businesses. Will come back to pickup more food in the future.< /Text>

<text>This is our go-to local thai food spot(especially since covid!) We love this place. Food is always delicious and the staff is always very friendly. We usually order some of the following: yellow curry with chicken, green curry with tofu, pad thai, fried wontons, and mango sticky rice. It is all sooo good. I crave the fried wontons all the time. Yummmm.<//text><gmapID>0x80c2c4150cb253dd:0x3b1a0b8f645788f2< /gmapID></record>

Every dish I have tried here has blown my mind a little. This is exactly the kind of unassuming, but excellent, restaurant I live for. If you’re not afraid of a fish with bones in it, you must try the crispy catfish. (You should try it even if you are afraid)< /text>

No frills Chinese restaurant, but the food was great. We had the sesame chicken and chicken chow mein and both were full of flavor and didn't make us feel gross after (aka not greasy). Nice people running the place. Definitely recommend.< /Text>

<text>Great food and customer service!
It's a cozy and relaxing/romantic restaurant.  The lights and music are soft. The place is clean and the food is delicious and fresh.  Prices are really good. I had salad, rice, tereyaki beef and an egg roll for $11. It's one of my favorite restaurants. Its like a little jewel in the community. I highly recommend.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

(3.5-ish) I think what makes this place and out is actually the price. It seems like reasonably priced Thai food but you're going to get only reasonably flavor in the food. It definitely doesn't taste disappointing, but you may find more interesting flavor profiles at Thai restaurants in Pasadena, San Gabriel, or other predominantly Asian areas.</Text>

<text>Fresh made food is awesome. The wait was worth it. I'm very picky when it comes to Orange Chicken. This was perfect. If your in the area stop in and get a bite. Nice quite place. Staff is not very friendly but the food makes up for it.

One of the few Thai restaurant in HP that serve good food. The wait staff service is amiable and generally impeccable . The interior design/space is plain, small and banal. Now let's get into the food. They serve great (e.g., beef veggie) and affordable food/beverages. They have an A grade from the LA's Dept of Health. Overall, I highly recommend Thai Fantasy for lunch and supper.<//text>

Horrible experience. I tried to order for delivery and my total was $14.95 and the very unfriendly rude attendant refused to send my order because of a $15 minimum . I offered to pay the 5 cents to which she said was not able of doing this. Bulls**t Customer service.</text>

Good, fast, pleasant. Pretty basic, just what you'd expect from a Thai place.< /Text>

I, too, am very picky about Orange Chicken. One of the best things about Thai Fantasy is that if you have a particular way you would like your choices prepared, the chefs will do their best to meet your expectations. I REALLY DO NOT LIKE the typical orange chicken on most Asian or Fusion restaurant menus in the vast Los Angeles area. Most of what I've experienced is doughy mush balls like what you might get at a Panda Express, for example, or any of the countless strip mall buffet / fast food, barely Chinese places that exist in abundance around here. I like my orange chicken extra crispy and Thai Fantasy has yet to disappoint me. If I order vegetables in brown sauce, and I like their brown sauce even if it is a bit salty, I request that my order have very little sauce. I don't like to waste food, so I make it as clear as possible exactly what I'd enjoy and on only a very few occasions when I was "experimenting," did I get a menu item that was unsatisfying. I for one am not a fan of fish heads. They make me paranoid, like they're staring at me with that one cataract clouded eye! I say if you give a place like Thai Fantasy a fair chance, have more than one meal there before giving them a bad review. The staff, servers, and food prep chefs will extend every courtesy to make sure that everything about your meal meets your expectations. They have done so for me 99 times out of 100... and that one bad experience I had... I believe I was so drunk, unlike how I am normally, that I ordered something so far out that my digestive tract was unprepared. That night I, like others who have left reviews here, worshiped at the feet of the porcelain Buddha! I didn't blame the food, I blamed the booze and my stupidity. As for the folks who got bad meat or ill prepared food, I hope they realize that restaurants that have been in business as long as Thai Fantasy do not, and cannot put up with such customer dissatisfaction. Don't you think they'd be out of business in a heartbeat if their food was always so very  bad and the service always sucked? Here's an idea, if you get something bad, that you don't like, or that might taste odd, or  that smells like poop: SEND IT BACK AND GET SOMETHING ELSE! Seriously, did someone really struggle with bad meat, finding 80% of it terrible? That means they continued to sample it even though it was awful. Why? This is America where no one who can afford it should ever be dissatisfied with a meal anywhere! In conclusion,  I really like this place. I'm just sad that so many seem to have had a bad experience while eating at Thai Fantasy. I'm not crying, but I could be...<//Text>

<Text>Step into the past. This is a classic Italian restaurant. Raised pizza holders, everything drenched in marinara, tall tufted black seats, wood panel wall covering, family meals, wine deals, dim lighting, it’s fantastic. If you love old style Italian food go here. I will definitely go back and bring friends with me. Next time I will update and add photos.</Text>< pictures>

A bit oily and greasy pizza I had, I dont think it was the same served to the other people there as they looked better! Still not a bad taste.</Text>

<Text>Have you ever wanted something so bad!!!!  The Hot Pastrami sandwich has been one of my favorite things at La Bella’s for years.

Today, we got to sit inside among the atmosphere and charm that we deeply missed over the past year.  The take out is really good, but dining in is way better..

I had a hot pastrami and fries.  Hot, fresh and it tasted much better than I remember.  The bread was so fresh and the pile of meat was awesome.

We sat in the bar area with two other people and then a group of five came in.  Plenty of space for eating and “my pod”.  The bar tender was great and the food today was exceptional!!  I have been coming here for over 50 years and it is very consistent and sooo good!!!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Rate>5</Rate>< userid>

<Review>I used to go to La Bella's a lot. The cheese on their pizza is delightful. Juicy and cheesy. The pizza melts in my mouth. I love it. I feel entertained when dining here.< /Review>< pictures>

Wait was a bit long and we kept being told 10mins or we're next. But it's a delicious place to eat and it was also a baseball game night. So that affects the wait more. But once we were in the food came fast and the service was great.<//Text>

Normally the food is good, and the service is friendly. We got a waiter with a serious attitude though and sadly didn’t even stay for food this time. The manager and the host apologized, so hopefully better luck next time.< /Review>

I definitely miss the Roast Beef Sandwich being on the menu but that got removed due to COVID and the Beef prices I'm sure. The Hot Pastrami is incredibly delicious as is the Italian Combo Torpedo, the Lasagna and the Chicken Alfredo Pasta. I am a big fan of their Garlic Bread!< /text>

La Bella's pizza has been around for years. Went back to Chula Vista for a visit and decided to try la Bella's again about 35 years after my first visit. It was really good. The pizza was tasty. Service was good and the outdoor seating was comfortable. Parking was plentiful in the back of the building. The chicken tender appetizers were a favorite at our table. When in Chula Vista on third Ave I highly recommend stopping in.< /Text>

YES! Home environment good pizza good down to earth service! This place is big too! You get dining area with table service or a small pick up with a counter to grab a quick bite as well as at the other end a bar with TVs....followed by a whole arcade game area! Alchohol available at all of these by the way. The pizza stuffed and cheesy very quick and delicious ! Loved it will be back<//text>

Pizza recipe has changed; dense, less cheese, no fresh yeast smell (sad). Ok craft beer selection but specials run out. Been a customer 30+ years & hopefully it's just staff challenges.
Photo has tomato paste peaking out.</review>

Been going here for years. I've even rented the room upstairs for special events. I went last night with my girls and the food was it what it used to be, maybe they're just warming up after the pandemic. Service wasn't the best either. I hope they pick up their game because I really love this place it's a part of Chula Vista history.<//Review>

When I eat pizza or lasagna when I’m home in the San Diego area, I eat at La Bella Pizza Garden in Downtown Chula Vista. The location is on the MTS 929 bus route, is very close to other downtown businesses such as antique stores if you want to browse after eating. It has outdoor street seating cafe style where you can drink your favorite beverage & watch the sunset, have your lunch or dinner. For the sports fan there’e A sports bar where if you love baseball that’s the place, remember it’s a San Diego Padres baseball, San Diego State, U.C.L.A. & U.S.C. For division one college sports as those are the home teams.< /Review>

This place is surely one of the most pleasant restaurants in the region. Every time I come there I am truly happy. They keep their very high  standard service and the topmost level of cooking  they give. You no doubt will love this restaurant. Highly  recommended.</Text>

< Review>
Pizza has lost its quality and my chicken wings were cold. The pizza was partially cold so had to reheat the pizza and wings in our oven. Worst,  we both ended up sick that night.... we will not be going back unfortunately after so many years of enjoying their food.</Review>

The reviews may have been right, unfortunately, I didn't order the pizza. I order baked lasagna....which turned out to he baked cheese, with two noodles. Great sauce, but not lasagna.
Was not charged, left disappointed. Great service.</Review>

<text>The building with the games seemed like a lot of fun but overall I've never felt so discriminated against in all of my life visiting this restaurant.  Also the main building smells weird. My friends and I were racially profiled and treated less than human and told that we couldn't be served outside and couldn't drink outside when another couple was served and allowed to drink wine outside.  It makes no sense. We were not unruly and had 3 small children with us at the time.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoiiKy8TjU9KCRk-6fiWpSW4uldX6EJQA1ysiY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

It was good not great. Be careful when booking on open table, there seems to be some confusion as to whether you belong at the Cafe or Garden. We checked in at the Garden and told to go to the Cafe, then told we should be at the Garden. Fortunately, the staff at the Cafe was much friendlier than the Garden and sat us.

Wings are lightly breaded and fried, the buffalo sauce was very good. The pizza was good, but have had better.<//Text>

<Text>The reviews may have been right, unfortunately, I didn't order the pizza. I order baked lasagna....which turned out to he baked cheese, with two noodles. Great sauce, but not lasagna.
Was not charged, left disappointed. Great service.<//Text><rate>3<//rate><user_id>105260599908469354296</user_id>< Response>

<Name>Audrey Pacheco< /Name><review>I made a reservation through their website knowing that it was outdoor dining only and when I told them that the woman at the front with the short blonde hair was very rude and brushed us off to call the manager. He, as well, was very rude in how he answered me and saying there was no such thing as reservations at this location. He then looked it up on his computer and was able to clearly see and tell me about the reservation I made. Decided not to eat there because of how much attitude they both had.</review>< user>

I order from here regularly but tonight was the first time there was an issue with my order. Not only was my problem handled with literally zero trouble, they had the replacement pizza at my house in less than 15 minutes, and sent me an extra pizza! The food is excellent, and though I haven't been to the restaurant itself in a long time, I do have tons of fond memories about eating there after soccer games as a kid.

La Bellas Pizza has been in business in Chula Vista longer than I've been alive and it's clear to see why. They're a local business who takes care of their customers and their food is great. What more could you ask for?< /text>

Very retro, sitting here was giving me flash backs from the eighties. Great place for  a family meal. It feels a little dirty and looks like the carpets haven't been cleaned since the eighties. But the the service was good and the extra cheesy pizza is delicious and they have some great beers on tap.</review>

Been coming here for about 10 years now. Great food, great service.  The chicken parmesan is good but some of the hot sandwiches are amazing,  the meatball sub is my personal favorite. The shrimp scampi linguine is another excellent choice.  Don't miss out on the garlic bread!!!<//Text>

This is one of my favorite pizza places in and around San Diego, perhaps second only to Filippis.  I can't vouch for any of the other items - all I get here is pizza and antipasto, and it's delicious. Service in the first dining room is usually fast and I'd call it no nonsense vs friendly, but a good experience none the less.</text>

<time>1581011519170</time><rating>1< /rating><Review>I went there on 2/4/20 for lunch, Holly waited on me and was very friendly in fact the service was the best part. My only complaint is she never asked how the food was. I viewed the photo gallery online of the food and the pizza looked good with lots of cheese. I ordered a large “Papas Favorite” with extra cheese. When I received it I asked Holly if this was extra cheese as it didn’t even look as cheesy as the ones in the photo gallery but she said it was. I asked that the cheese not be burned which they didn’t but the crust was not fully cooked at all. I was hungry and ate it but it was like pizza at a Chinese Buffet I know this Papa was completely unsatisfied. I didn’t say anything to Holy because she didn’t ask and at that point I knew she didn’t cook it and I just didn’t want to take it out on her. I still gave her a good tip and gave my leftovers to a homeless lady across the street. I wish I had gone to Dominos at least then I would get what I paid for and it would have tasted a whole heck of a lot better! This was my first and last time here, I’ve already told those I work with and others in the building to avoid it! One guy said they had good sandwiches, lol!! Sad I’m sure when Papa ran the place it was authentic, not like a store bought frozen pizza!!!!<//Review>< pics>

Anyways, she told me that it's fine and since it can't be just the two of us, to invite some friends. I didn't have many friends at the time, so I asked a friend of mine that knew her if she wanted to join us and she agreed and asked if she could bring her boyfriend, which I knew well, and I said it's fine. At this time, the friend that came with me mentions that she didn't bring any money and neither did her boyfriend. Great, I thought.<//Review>

I love La Bella in Chula Vista. I am a long time native of this city and this place has been a memory of mine with family and friends since I was a young child. Its family orientated but also has a bar and is a laid back casual setting for ALL ages. The food is super delicious. The bread is so good and the employees are friendly and very courteous. The place gets packed on the nights mostly on weekends but there is always parking because people come and go quite regularly here. You can park in the back and enter behind or go up the ramp to the face paced more kid friendly dining area. I love the fettuccini Alfredo. Super damn good you can add chicken or shrimp but the sauce is mouthwatering. My good friend TOMMY works here as he has for more than 10 years. He is good friends with the owner. I highly recommend this place for any occasion or just take out or have it delivered. You won't be disappointed!!! God bless you and be kind to others please...you never know what exactly a person is going through and nobody is qualified to criticize or judge any other person as they themselves are not perfect.💛💙💜💚❤< /text>

Their best food item is pizza!! I have the fettuccine without meat and I did not like it. I also tried the garlic buffalo wings they were okay but very sour. The garlic bread is sourdough and doesn't taste much like garlic bread.</Review>

I been dining here off and on for a long time, since the late 1960s. The food has always been good, especially the pizza. I prefer a medium Papa's favorite, as it seems to be cooked perfectly every time. The large is very good, but once in a while is not cooked quite as perfectly as the medium size. Pastrami sandwich, and lasagna are other favorites. Antipasto salad great, too. Prices are good. One of my all-time favorite places.</review>

This place has been in Chula Vista forever and we finally got around to trying it out.  We ordered an online takeout pizza,  antipasto and mozzarella bread.  When we arrived to pick up our order it wasn't ready yet. They apologized and let us know that the online ordering isn't always trustworthy. They got us the pizza as fast as they could. Overall, the food was delicious with decent portions.  Also, their customer service was fantastic.<//review>

They have really good salads, party combos, and the sandwiches are good too. The only thing is I think the wings are over priced, they are good but who wants to pay almost $20 for a dozen small wings. The pizza is good too but the cheese has a lot of salt in it<//Review>

In a random spot down in Chula Vista but worth a visit. Huge portions. Incredible food. The Original wings are probably the best I've ever had. They have them down to a science. Calzone is more like a stuffed pizza. Sandwiches are insane. Will definitely return.</Text>

La Bella's On a Saturday Night:  We had no waiting,  arriving close to 7 p.m.
Comfortable,  not crowded. We ate on the dinner side (not arcade).
Service was friendly and prompt. Food was delicious. We had a cheese and Papa's Choice (?), fish & chips, Philly Cheese steak, and spaghetti. Everything came at the same time (oh, after our salads). Timing was great!!
Again, service was great. We will be back!!</review>

Delicious food at this Chula Vista landmark (as far as I am concerned). Tony, Mike, and Stan are doing a great job with the place and the community really supports them! I love the pizza and lasagna. The servers are very attentive and friendly as well.</review>

<rate>5</rate><text>I always love La Bella's pizzeria!  It's one of those places that you know you'll have a great time.  You know the food is always good and the family vibe is always inviting.  It's perfect for any occasion, for any reason really.  It's part of the fabric of our community and has changed with the times while staying true to it's original feel.  If you haven't visited in a while bring the family in for a treat.  If you have never had the pleasure... what are you waiting for?  Don't miss out on a spectacular meal at La Bella's, truly one of Chula Vista's hot spots.  Only downside in my opinion is parking.</text>< pics>

< Review>
Driving past this eatery looked interesting enough to have dinner with my family. We orderd the Kitty style 4 to taste there basic menue choices. First came the antipasta salde which was desent along side the butter toast  that had no garlic. Spagittie with red sauce and pizza followed out immediately. The pasta tased as if they poured it stright out of the can. Pasta left  Strange after taste. Very unsettling. Our server Cristen gladly offered us alfredo pasta to fix the issue, but it was even more dissatifying calling her back over asking for the check, and a box for the pizza and salde. Once again Cristen offered to fix the problem with take home frozen brownies to take home and enjoy. Once at home we thought thrird times the charm we opened the brownies and realized it was extreamly undercooked. My 5 year old son started vomiting. Cristen has great customer service too good to be comming up with excusses for her bossess recipes that are flavorless and disgusting.< /Review>

The food was amazing. The service was outstanding. It was the Family restaurant. But, things change. The staff changed. The food, while still good, is no longer amazing. The service is friendly, but not outstanding. The arcade says it all. The old days are over. Not bad. Maybe even pretty good sometimes. I guess we have to settle for that.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Awesome, We have La Bella's Pizza at least once a week. It is our go to Pizza Place. Unfortunately, the pasta dishes pale compared to the pizza. We love the atmosphere and the servers get to know you and its nice. We love La Bella's Pizza.<//Text>< GmapID>

<username>Veronica Ramirez< /username><response>None</response><Text>I have heard some really good things about La Bella.  Family members rave about the  how good the food is here.  I have ordered pizza for take out and I love the fact that they use a lot of cheese.  Today was my first time eating in so my expectations were high.  The place was surprisingly packed for a weekday night. I ordered the spaghetti with a meatball.  I really was expecting a really good Italian flavor.  What I got is far from it.  I think they forgot the spices altogether. It tasted like tomato  sauce over wet noodles. It was so bland that after 3 bites I just didn't  even want to eat anymore.  This is not a good representation  of  a good Italian sauce.  My husband ordered the lasagna and I had a bite.  Delicious!.  Even the side of sausage with sauce had more flavor than my spaghetti.  I guess I'll  stick to the pizza and lasagna.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

LA Bella's been around forever and is a staple of Chula Vista. The food is just as good as it was when I was a kid. If you live in Chula Vista, you know what LA Bella's is. And if you don't, I don't even want to know you. 😄< /Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Even on a crowded Friday night the waits to be seated or served are almost non existent. The food is great, I've had the calzones, the pizza, and the lasagna. Of all different sizes and can say they've always been delicious and more than enough to fill you up. If it's a small party I recommend getting smaller size portions. We ordered a large and a medium sized pizza and lasagna for four and had left overs. The building itself is on the older side and could probably use a renovation but I prefer that sort of coziness. Service was excellent and we would return any time.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80d94e0816297829:0x49b71ed43c3e5c8a< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Been coming here for years!! Food is is always great, service is hit and miss.
Today we walked in and older gentleman handed us 2 menus and said sit anywhere.
Welp, 15 minutes later we are still sitting, mind you only 1 party of about 8 in the room, another party of 3 already had to go boxes and appeared to be serviced by the bar waitress.   When we asked who was gonna service us (since nobody acknowledged us) the bar waitress tells us the person serving party of 8, which we only saw 1 time. Have the decency to at least say you will be right over, bring water, or for that matter have someone else offer if you cant handle it.
So needless to say bar waitress AND guy who told us to have a seat all placed blame on one another. Instead of apologizing and offering to fix it. BYE PEOPLE, yes we left! We drove over an hour to get here and is always a favorite, but looks like I need to find a new favorite!<//text>

A true community favorite. I don't remember a time when it wasn't there. Its not enough to say that it's a 3rd Avenue staple, but rather it's turned into 3rd Avenue's foundation.
The reason is simple, the food. Yes the owners and workers are nice and hospitable, and yes there's something for everyone a simple sit down restaurant, a full bar, arcade for the kids and place for special events. All of this is great, but without the freshly, handmade pizza and amazing cheesey bread and astounding pasta none of it would be worth it.

Try it for yourself, you'll see why we locals love La Bella's and why we would never want it to leave.
P.s. I always get the out of this world lasagna! Highly recommend it!👌🏻✨</Text>

Friendly atmosphere, good food! I ordered a chicken salad and it was huge (delicious too). Chicken bites were also delicious too. I hope I get to go back before I leave Chula Vista :)</Text>

Great establishment, great food and great atmosphere! Servers and staff are kind and prompt. There are 2 buildings, the first is a large dining room and the second is another large dining room with multiple pool tables, dartboards, tons of arcade games for the kids and a jukebox. My family and I dine here often and always have a positive experience.< /Text>

Two separate bars and family dining areas, kid zone, pool tables, banquet rooms, they also deliver. 5 stars for the delicious food, 4.5 stars for the amenities, 3.5 stars for the customer service.

This place has changed a lot. About half the games are not working and the food is very nasty. We paid about $55 for a very small family meal the pasta tasted very gross and the sauce tasted like it was straight out of the can. This is a perfect place for playing pool or just drinking on the weekends with your buddies. But to go out as a family to eat your money will be better worth elsewhere. I have been to better places that sell sandwiches and pizza and wings and spent less than $50 and received a better meal</Text>

<text>This restaurant is a staple in Chula Vista! We have had many family gatherings here. We love their pizza and the antipasto salad. When ever we come we eat on the Cafe side so the kids can play games. My husband and his friends like to go have a beer and play pool. I would highly recommend this place the prices are amazing for how great the food is.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80d94e0816297829:0x49b71ed43c3e5c8a</GmapID></record>

This place is amazing. Every time we visit San Diego this is a wonderful go to for dinner on the first night. Their pizza is to die for, the staff in the front are always pleasant and very friendly to interact with. If you're in the area I would highly recommend dining in or grabbing carry out. It's very filling so a small/medium is great for just two people!</text>

La Bella's is a Chula Vista institution. They are always busy. Reasonable prices, good food. Nothing fancy, families, parties. Metered parking with some free parking nearby, but meters free after 6 PM and on Sundays. Restaurant is split into two building; one has pool and game room.< /text>

<text>The pizza there doesn't look like much when you get it but once you bite in,  it is amazing how many toppings they cram in each bite.  I took my whole crew out to lunch. About 18 guys 1 gal and they are all hard working large shipyard workers with mean appetites. Only 5 pizzas and a few pitchers of soda and every one was stuffed and left satisfied. The pizza was cut into thin little slivers but each slice was loaded with toppings.  I ordered a 6th meat lovers pizza and no one had any room in their bellies and ended up taking it home with me.  Took me all weekend to finish it.  I invited the crew to lunch thinking it was gonna cost me 3 or 4 hundred bucks to feed them... It ended up being closer to $150. Everything was delicious, service was amazing, and everyone left very satisfied.< /text>< pics>

I've been coming here for more than 20 years and the food never disappoints. Before I sit down I always order the garlic cheese bread as it's always made fresh and is delicious. They now have a games side which is great for the kids and parties. Pool tables,  NFL TVs, and a bar for the grown ups makes it a great atmosphere. Definitely a local favorite and hidden gem</Text>

< review>
La Bella's is one of those places that gives me a familial, small-town feel in the Southbay. I've come here in the past for a school banquet, family birthdays, and a graduation celebration. This time around, it was for a going away dinner. We showed up on a Friday evening needing a table for 12, no reservation,and checked in on the 3rd ave side of the restaurant. The lady said there was a 1 hr wait, but had us check with the newer side with the games. Luckily we did, they were able to seat us right away. They have vegetarian friendly options, I got the eggplant parmesan. It was cheesy and good!! The Texas toast that came with it was yummy too. They could work on getting better tasting tap water, and making the long tables not too close to each other, it was hard to get in and out.

Other than that, they have pool tables, arcade games with tickets for prizes, a medium sized banquet room to rent for events, a bar, and TVs for sports. Staff was super friendly on both sides.<//review>

Best dish on their menu!!... Sandwiches are also a good option!
Pizzas are ok. Great family restaurant with a  bar and a game room in the back. Very busy on weekends.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<text>This place always delicious. Great place to grab some Italian/American food. Service decent, but attention to detail can be improved. Gets 4 stars because it's in desperate need of renovation. I think the original furniture from opening day is still being used. Seems dirty</text></record>

I live out of state now and haven't eaten here in 15 years. But it's amazing. The lasagna is to die for. I practically lived off it growing up. I'm pregnant and sniffling because I miss their lasagna and garlic bread so much, Haha. Will definitely be my first stop if I ever make it back to Chula vista.<//Text>

Food good and prices aren't bad.  Really liked the staff. Reminds me of a small Dave and Buster's but featuring italian food in a more casual atmosphere. Lots and lots of seating and a cute game area. I heard there is a back entrance, but I parked and walked in the front area that has the games.  In front is street parking and after 5pm you can park in a small lot next door<//text>

<Review>I really enjoy how there is a full Italian restaurant, then there is an arcade part. But, the only thing that I disliked that I gave it a 4-star is that there is no pepperoni pizza. But, other than that I really love the place.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80d94e0816297829:0x49b71ed43c3e5c8a<//Gmap_id>< response>

<Review>Excellent pizza. Excellent service. La Bella's pizza has the most cheese of all pizzas w/o ordering Xtra cheese. I love it. I've been going there for about, 40 years. This pizza has always been as delicious as it is today. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND, LA BELLA'S PIZZA.</Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< date>

She didnt bring out our pizza even though it was sitting there for about 20 plus minutes. I watched  another waitress get the pizza , walk over to Amber and waited til she told  her which table the pizza belonged to. So it was cold when we got it. She didnt come back to refill our drinks. We had to go to the register to get them from someone else.  Amber didnt return so we got tired of waiting and walked back to the register to ask for our bill. She finally returned to hand us the bill to sign and before my sister could finish signing it she pulled it away from her. She was rude!!!!! I could not believe the poor service! It was very upsetting.
We have been customers for years and this was the worst service we have ever recieved here.<//text><gmap_id>0x80d94e0816297829:0x49b71ed43c3e5c8a< /gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Name>

<review>Delicious, delicious pizza, and the sandwiches are also great. I have great memories of this place and it will always be the gold standard of pizza to me. The place is more expensive than most of the chain pizza joints, but you get what you pay for. I know guys that can put away a whole Pizza Hut pizza, but will be good eating one or two slices of a La Bella's pizza. They have a great beer selection, but you will have a long wait both to be seated and served on Friday or Saturday nights.<//review><rating>5< /rating>< name>

La Bellas food and services are excellent, our family and friends have had Birthday day partys and Anniversarys going on 16 years. My only complaint is the mens bathroom smells of pee and pee on the floor I'm sure it s stems from the bar guys half drunk and cant hit the toilet hand blower not working and no paper towels. Have brought to management attention  but no results. But don't keep that from eating there very good restaurant.< /text>

La Bella Pizza is a fun and delicious place for yummy Italian food. It's a staple in Chula Vista and has been for years.  All the natives know about La Bellas.  It's old and the hype is real.  My favorite dish is the Papa's Favorite Calzone! Oh my goodness, so fantastic.  Their prices are so affordable for such great quality of food. Their pizzas are to die for and the antipasto salad is so good too.  If you want to have an event you can reserve the top floor.  I went to a bridal shower there. Or you want a fun spot to watch the game on the tube or play games, they have an adjacent building where they expanded the pizzeria. It's a must visit for Chula crowds.</Review>

<gmap_id>0x80d94e0816297829:0x49b71ed43c3e5c8a<//gmap_id><review>La Bella Pizza is a fun and delicious place for yummy Italian food. It's a staple in Chula Vista and has been for years.  All the natives know about La Bellas.  It's old and the hype is real.  My favorite dish is the Papa's Favorite Calzone! Oh my goodness, so fantastic.  Their prices are so affordable for such great quality of food. Their pizzas are to die for and the antipasto salad is so good too.  If you want to have an event you can reserve the top floor.  I went to a bridal shower there. Or you want a fun spot to watch the game on the tube or play games, they have an adjacent building where they expanded the pizzeria. It's a must visit for Chula crowds.</review>< Rate>

My only complaint is the mens bathroom smells of pee and pee on the floor I'm sure it s stems from the bar guys half drunk and cant hit the toilet hand blower not working and no paper towels. Have brought to management attention  but no results. But don't keep that from eating there very good restaurant.< /review>< rating>

<text>Utterly and completely disappointing.

Went here because we had heard the pizza was awesome. Okay, we'll give it a shot.

We walk in and the lady who took us back to the dining room said "you're server will be with you eventually, we're busy." Hard to believe considering there were maybe only one or two other tables filled.

Server did show up shortly thereafter which was nice. We ordered a pizza to share.

For anyone who has been underway on a Navy vessel, you know the kind of pizza you get on the line for  "pizza and wing" night or if you have to stay out for a weekend because port ops can't support securing you to the pier. Yea....this pizza was eerily similar to that stuff. Flavorless crust and toppings (something I didn't know was a possibility).

Had to eventually go ask the bartender for a refill on our drinks because our server disappeared after delivering the pizza.

Maybe this place is worth a visit if you're coming for a beer and to watch a football game. Absolutely not worth coming for the food.< /text><pictures>None</pictures></record>

< Review>
Worse customer service ever received it was my first time did not know what seating or anything was about. I asked at the front if my family and I could sit anywhere and we were told yes we could seat anywhere. Once my family and I sat we were rapidly questioned by Ana one of the Managers if we had reservations, then went on to say because if we didn't we couldn't sit there, it was not the fact that we could not sit there it was how she approached us with the worse attitude and demeanor ever. First and last for my family and I. I then asked if her manager was available she said I am the manager than I said there is someone above you she then answered well no, told her we were taking our business elsewhere where she than answered oh well I'm sorry, but I don't have seating on this side you are going to have to go to the other restaurant side to get some seats, with that attitude and rudeness no thanks. She said they had nothing to do with the arcade area and that the employee on that side did not know about the seating that they had nothing to do with them, not a way to Express yourself about your employees especially a manager. This place lost customers and 350 dollars which is what we spend elsewhere. Never again< /Review>

I love the breakfast pizza from here but was craving bacon. Ordered simple bacon and eggs over medium. Service was slow. I could hear the staff talking about their weekend. Coffee was luke warm n when meal came bacon was burnt to a crisp(uneatable). Server never came back to check on me. Will stick to the breakfast pizza from now on<//text>

Wish this place was better. The dough is meh at best. The sauce to cheese ratio is absolutely horrendous unless you want a little sauce and crust with your cheese. Greasy due to the over cheesing to boot. Oh anf if you want a calzone, go elsewhere! Their idea of a calzone is a regular pizza with the dough equivalent of another whole pizza on top! Whoever thought that was a good idea obviously hasn't ever had one before. I could go on and on but I digress...</Review>

Oh and yes! Finally a place for people who care more about the flavor of a milk alternative, rather than soy's impact on estrogen levels. They should change the name of almond milk to "almond bum milk'. So gross. Anyway, they also have all the regular dairy and soy out for regular coffee. For sweeteners they have trivia Stevie which is the one that tastes good instead of metallic, regular sugar and agave.</Review>

I've looked for over 45 years, no one, is better than the La Bellas. I always order pizza but it doesn't matter what you order spaghetti lasagna whatever it's all good. It's a restaurant where you feel like the people that work there are people you know, chances are, they might be.<//Text>

<Text>The pizza is absolutely delicious. I haven't had any issues with anything in their menu.

Fun fact. There are two parts to La Bellas' location. One is a traditional restaurant that's quietly welcoming and the other is a sports bar, game room, and arcade all in one. I like both equally.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

La Bella's is always a great time. Friendly staff and great beer selections with some yummy food selections. Hot boneless wings are delicious. White Sauce pizza is a favorite. (To those that don't like pepp under cheese, ask for it on top. It's not that difficult).<//Text>

If you like a lot of cheese on your pizza this is a good place to go.  They carry the usual variety of dishes for an Italian  restaurant.  I usually order a pizza or the hot pastrami sandwich witch is one of the best that I've ever had.<//Review>

<Review>Ordered $60 tipped $10 and the pastas had barley any sauce and zero flavor. The fries were soggy and cold. The pizza was decent, called to let them know and they simply said they’d give me a credit next time. So $70 down the drain, still hungry and I’m 98% you can’t eat an IOU.< /Review>< Pics>

<name>Avser</name><Text>good food but i think you have to go to the resturant to benefit from a HOT meal. all three times i've ordered a pizza the delivery time was said to be 45-and hour. all times took and hour and a half and one time they didnt even deliver until i called them about it which means i didnt get my cold pizza that i now have to microwave for and hour and 45min.. my food is always cold when i get it. their delivery is garbage and i they charge you a delivery fee. i no longer tip the driver and i might even stop ordering from there all together or at the very least go into the building and wait for them to bake my pizza that will take 20min.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Time>1564278591530<//Time>< UserId.>

Standard Italian cuisine, but done quite well. There is a decent selection of vegetarian options, the interior is comfortable and clean, and our servers were great. Wonderful history in the place as well.</review>

La Bellas is a Chula Vista landmark. Sure they have been around since the 1950's, but I must be honest and say that their food is very mediocre and lacking. I find their pasta generic, their pizza too greasy and their service just okay. They do have a great sports bar in the back as well as a newer game room that has arcade games and pool tables. But if you're looking for a good pizza or pasta dish in Chula Vista, I recommend filippis pizza on Broadway. It is far superior...</Text>

<Text>La Bella's is the premier family run pizza restaurant in Chula Vista.  It's been there since the 50s and even expanded in recent years to open include an & games wing of the restaurant.  Their pizza is the winner as the cheese it really good and the crust is more like a party than bread.  They have a lot of other Italian dishes to choose from as well lots of different torpedo sandwiches.  It's a great place to take the family or just pick up a pizza to go.  They also deliver to a limited area as well so as long as you live close enough they'll bring it to your house.  Anything on the menu is fair game and you can place orders online at their website too.<//Text>< Resp>

The service was great. The food was semi decent. Everything from the carpet to the tables has probably been there since they opened in 1955.< /review>

I've been going to this place since I was little.  The food is consistently good, particularly the pizza.  I've noticed over the past couple of years the service quality has gone down a bit.  The newer gaming side stays cleaner and well-kept, but the original restaurant shows its age.  Restrooms are almost always in need of cleaning.< /Review>

< Review>
so we were in Chula Vista and was craving pizza and we couldn't decide what pizza place to eat at so we asked around and they told us to check out this place. I thought it was gonna be super touristy but it turned out to be okay!!! We ordered a small pizza and you can add and subtract toppings as to your liking. We actually were going to take the rest home on our flight back to CA but when I looked up, the pizza had been finish. Wine selection with the pizza is also delicious!<//Review>

Classic heart and soul of Chula Vista. Grew up here and was one of the things I looked most forward to visiting. Lasagna was great. Wife enjoyed her pizza with gluten free crust.</Text>

<review>This place has a great rep, yet the food and service leave little to be desired. I've been in the industry for 25 years and have never been so disgusted with the service and in food in any restaurant as much as this one.  I'd rather sit out front of a little caesers and the food and service would be better.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

It so sad to see a Chula Vista classic turn into a disorganized mess, but that’s La Bella's in the face of any sort of crowd. One time they even moved me in the middle of a meal after already seating me twice because she needed those table for larger crowd. Not to mention they screwed up our order and lady’s attitude was as unprofessional as her service, she was childish, confrontational and rude. The people working the food area on the game side all acted like they had a stick up there but because they had to work a crowd. If I wanted someone to demean me while I ate, I would have stayed married and I wouldn’t have had to pay for it either. Lol. But I will miss the old La Bella’s that I remember growing up, even if it is long gone, in place of this Las Colinas' Grad program.< /review>

<text>My family and I have been coming here for years. It's a gem of Chula Vista. My favorite pizza is the, 'Papa's Favorite' this comes with Cheese, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, olives and we add jalepenos. This is delicious! The buttery crust is amazing. The environment is laid back and kid friendly. The service is friendly and welcoming and the prices are affordable.</text>< pics>

Food was not very good, service wasn't either.  A bit pricey, and really not worth it in my opinion. Beer was excellent though. Atmosphere was lively with TV's and sports going on.  I would not go back.</text>

<text>I love their pizza..it is the best!! Tonight I was going to try something different. A burger and fries. I phoned in the order then called back after realizing $25 was a grip to spend and that the total should have been $15. Dude couldn't explain why it was that much, so I canceled the order. I've never had this happen before here, so it won't stop me from ordering again. But I will be scrutinizing that bill from now on...< /text></record>

Nice visit. Good food. Frustrated that it is a loud place and that waitress insisted on talking so low our table couldn't hear anything she was saying to us. We observed the same issue at her other tables and even her manager reacting to her whisper on the floor.
Think about your job and atmosphere and boost it up girl!< /Review>

First time visiting this place, when we came in the staff coordinator welcomed us and asked how many, we told him we were 18 but 5 more came to meet us so total 23, he quickly went to see how much room he had since its Saturday night, he also asked if we had a reservation but we didnt even thoe we called ahead but no reservation was made, everything was well coordinated, almost everyone in my party wanted to go play at the arcades so we ordered food and went to play while it was getting ready, everyone liked the place, we had a great time, but I feel like waiters need to be patient and wait until we are fully done eating, one of them came and asked me to grab our pizza stand and I did so he tooked the pizza stand and left me there holding onto the pizza pan, there was bearly some room in my table to set it down so another guy came to help, is not a complaint just a quick advise to help out wait until we are fully done, if you dont have enough, maybe invest a little more to give customer better service and satisfaction overall great first time!< /review>

Cockroach!!! Went with all the family and had a good time food was good and service was great too but at the end of the dinner I saw a cockroach walking on the table across from us that grossed me out after eating all that food. They really need to fix that problem.</text>

We used to love having our family nights at La Bella Pizza until last night. Rude waitress! One person can definitely not make you want to go back! Keep your personal issues to yourself, and don't give the bad vibes to your customers! Sorry Bellas' for 5 less customers you will no longer have going back.</Text>

This is my third visit to Bella. I won't mention the previous two just yesterdays dilemma. What's worse than going out to a meal and it not having it go the way you would like? Recommending the place to family and spouting off how great it is and then having it not go the way expected. First off (how I dislike to use that term) the food has been, is and probably will be great for a long time. The waitstaff however is another story altogether. We ate in the first dining room. We were greeted right away and were asked for our drink orders. It was obvious that our young server was new to employment and to the service industry. We were a table of four. We all ordered sandwiches. Forty-three minutes later the first sandwich came. Five minutes later the second sandwich came. When asked what the problem might be the server immediately stated it was the 'boys in the kitchen'. I had full view of the kitchen's service window. There were a lot of stares our way and I was actually a little embarrassed for the server. My guesstimate was that the server just forgot to turn the order in and she was frazzled because of it. For minutes later our third sandwich was delivered. Five more minutes later my sandwich finally arrived. I applaud the 'boys' in the kitchen for banging out the food as quick as possible. The food was incredible. Unfortunately in the restaurant business there are two factors in my opinion, service and quality of food. Bella, you're wonderful. Server(s), make note of how the well seasoned servers at Bella handle their tables. Good luck...Thank you, Jay<//Text>

And by lately, I mean we still go here 2 or 3 times a year since moved out of the So. Bay. One day the cheese was lacking. We went back 6 months later and it was abundant again. Growing up in the area in 60s and 70s, the amount of cheese on their pizzas was always the treat.

The food was great as always but our server was absolutely horrible. I have been here several times and have never seen such poor service. Our appertiser  came with our food. One member of our party didn't get her food until everyone else was almost done eating. We ordered drinks when we sat down and didn't receive them until 2 mins before our food came. And it took almost 45 mins to get our food. The waitress was a heavy set dark haired lady who obviously didn't care about her job. She just kept blaming the kitchen and bar. We could see her just standing in the kitchen drinking her drink and not caring about her customers. We had taken family there that was in town from Michigan. Like we always do. Guess next time it will be Felipe's....<//review>

Well we thought we would dine in, cuz delivery has been horrible. Dine in wasn't much better. They weren't busy, our pizza arrived "warm", it should have been popping hot? Think we will find a different pizza place. So dissapointed!!!
Update: we tried again, dine in service ..never going back. How can food be luke warm??? Just a terrible vibe, the don't care attitude. To bad<//text>

<text>Such a good time everytime we go and everyone is so courteous and maintains a constant hustle for such a busy place. For $50, a huge pizza, a big appetizer, a pitcher of beer and a pitcher of soda is a deal!!! Thank you to Thomas at the game center for having such a great attitude and being so hospitable while my kids run around.<//text>< pictures>

The pizza here is delicious. One of the things I like the best about it is that it's layered. So the toppings are placed on the bread and the cheese is melted over it. I wasn't too fond of the salad here. So stick with the pizza, you won't be disappointed. Plus, the prices are very reasonable and the portions are generous.< /review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Review>I had my wedding reception here and I was truly not that satisfied. The food is great and great place to eat but I do not recommend parties here. There's so many regulations here that they don't tell you about firsthand. The booking is horrible, you're only allowed about 1-2 hrs before your party to set up, even the day of they still want to book before or after yours which is ridiculous, you can't even enjoy your special day, they charge for every bottle you bring in that's not theirs. They don't allow candles to be turned on. Then I worked on a slide show for about a month to show our guest and they don't help you set it up plus they didn't even have the cords available. I was so mad, I couldn't even show it. Do not have your parties here, not worth it.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

We had a awesome time !!! I booked my grandson's birthday party here in the game room side and it went great.  The people that had the party before us went a little over their time slot but they got everything cleaned up very very fast and and worked with us because that made us run a little behind as well. The food was great and the service was fast especially with them knowing we were on a schedule with our tables. This was the 2nd year of having our grandsons birthday party here he has always had it at Johns incredible pizza before that but after having it here last year his mind was made up this is his Birthday spot . The food is soooooooo much better and it's way easier to keep an eye on the kids plus for the adults their are pool tables.  (Well not just for adults cause my grandchildren play pool also) Either way my opinion is this is a great place for a birthday party for kids.  They will have a Blast and your not stuck eating pizza that tastes like cardboard ( Win Win )</text>

When I told the waiter all he did was take a napkin, remove the pesky critter, briefly apologized and left as if it was no big deal. My husband mentioned it to the manager and he also just apologized.

One of my favorite pizzas in SD. The front part looks a little old but the back part is new and even has games. Beer selection is decent and whole pizza prices are similar to most non pizza hut, dominoes etc. Definetly worth eating here.< /text>

<Text>An institution in Chula Vista.  Pizza's iffy, especially on a busy night, when they tend to hurry the pies out of the oven.  The calzones are a good option, as is the french bread pizza.  La Bella's has really come into its own as a craft beer joint in the last few years.  They run a decent selection of taps in both sections of the restaurant.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Great place for some pizza, beers, and some pool table fun. You can bring the kids to the arcade section and be worry free. The food is good but the selection is basically pizza or wings. The only drawback is that if you dont make a reservation you will be stuck waiting, even if you do you cant be there for long because they will force you to move if there is another party waiting. Parking is also scarce so I would recommend getting there early or youll be forced to pay for parking in the surrounding streets. Great place for an afterwork beer if you can find parking and a spot at the tables.</Text>

Delicious food and good service. Be aware that the calzone is basically a pizza with two crusts. Huge portions!</Review>

Pizza tasted like someone threw cheese on top of sauce and a cardboard crust. The place clearly needs a renovation or has started as there was at least one room that looked to be for storage. Service was good, food was just very meh.< /Text>

Staff bring food out sporadically, it doesn't taste great. The staff won't serve alcohol to the table. No music but great tv's. The staff is friendly shout out to Liz who talked with us and made us feel comfortable. And small bathrooms.< /review>

<text>Ordered and said it would be ready in 20 minutes. Went to pick up and they couldn't find my order. Had given to someone else and had to remake everything. Had to wait another 30 minutes on my order only to get home and discover they didn't give me the extras toppings I paid for on the remake.<//text>< UserId.>

<text>The hostess was rude and unprofessional, the wait was very long and not worth the food they serve.  Their pizza taste just like a frozen boxed regular pizza, their spaghetti had no flavor.  Although their chicken wings were very good, and the waitress did an outstanding job.</text>< Pics>

Food was great but I felt that the staff was not as friendly as usually and they were not efficient as the food took a very long time to come out. Not sure if this place is declining. I also found it really annoying that the waiters were hanging out in the back instead of waiting on tables<//Review>

< Review>
I went there for the first time on 1/10/15, It was AWESOME. The Service was superb, and the food was deliverd hot. It was excellent through and through. It's my new home for Italian food, especially PIZZA!
The prices were fair. The wine list is excellent as well. Try the Riunite red, if you like full flavor without an after taste, very pleasing on the pallet.<//Review>

Great pizza, nice server staff, great beer selection  (sometimes they run out of the ones I want). Minus one star because occasional inconsistencies (servers and cooks), nonetheless food is amazing and the management works pretty well to make sure everything is running smoothly.<//text>

This restaurant is my favorite place to get pizza in the south bay area. The place is generally busy on the weekends. I think that is a good sign they are doing things right.< /Review>

<Review>Food was great but I felt that the staff was not as friendly as usually and they were not efficient as the food took a very long time to come out. Not sure if this place is declining. I also found it really annoying that the waiters were hanging out in the back instead of waiting on tables</Review>< Pics>

The toppings listed online don't match their menu so even though we made sure the pizza we ordered did not have onions the pizza we got was covered in them. When I called to complain that we got the wrong pizza the manager told me they had no control over the pizza description from the online menu sisnce it was through a third party. Why even offer that then? This was just an expensive disappointing experience. The employee that answered the phone offered to get the manager so they could send the correct order but the manager got on the phone and said it was not their mistake and they didn't have the delivery drivers available to send out another pizza. We will not be ordering from here again, there are too many great restaurants in this area to make that mistake again.< /review><Response>None<//Response>< Time>

I only have one complaint - my chicken primavera had way too much cheese sauce. It was so over powering I couldn't eat it.<//text>< time>

Delivery order was cold, so sent it back. Called the manager and she argued with me saying it was  not cold, and that I was ridiculous. Never ordering from them again or eating there. They are very rude, all of them.
Watch out, some one in these reviews on this page or the next posted that they ate there and saw a cockroach! We are sooo lucky the food was cold and sent it back. If not, we would have never known another recent customer posted a bad review, and said there is cockroaches there. Yuuuucckk!
Disgusting and on top of that they are super rude now. My mom had been a loyal customer for over 30 yrs!
She said "they lost me forever". Tomorrow we are going to post on all our social media and call our friends and family and tell them never to buy from them again. Ask them to call their friends and family, and do the same also. SAD!!!<//Review>

There were many items on the menu that they were out of or hadnt prepped yet. I dont know if its cost cutting measures or poor prep but it was inconvenient. The server wasnt that knowledgeable about the menu either. But the staff was young so what do you expect when they're used to dealing with messy nosy kid parties. We werent part of that, but its was a deer in headlights look the whole time. Food was good.<//review>

This place is a dump. food, service and the dirty old dinning room are disappointing. They claim to be best pizza in Chula vista I dont think thats the case.  You may be able to find best CV pizza down the road at either of the two other Italian restaurants. Avoid this place unless you enjoy rude employees, roaches running across your table as happend to me. The food is not terrible but not good either. This place did use to be decent unfortunately not the case anymore.< /text>

The wait was crazy (like 45 min) and then they forgot how many in the party and tried to put the 5 of us in separate tables. The place was pretty dirty and not really that fun (for us or the kids) by the time we finally ate the food was good but after all that it was too little too late< /text>

<user_name>Alicia Sepulveda</user_name><Text>I went for my birthday and food was great however service from the waitress could have been better with asking us more often if we needed anything; one of the items I ordered which was a sandwich took forever to get to our table, and also waitress could have seemed cheerful and made me feel more comfortable if she looked happy to be there working; and there was no dessert at all for me to enjoy after my dinner which to me was horrible that not one dessert item was available.</Text>< pictures>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><rating>1</rating><Resp>None< /Resp><Review>Went to La Bellas for my daughters bithdate on 1/11/18. After eating i asked for boxes for left overs, they were brought. The boxes had roach droppings (poop) and an actual bug came cralwing out the box on to the table. I told the waitress and the manager and they didnt seem to care. All the manager said was " Sorry, we will clean them up" Like really, this is a very sanitary issue. That makes me wonder how roach and bug infested they are in their kitchen and storage area. Enjoy your meals  </Review>< gmapID>

I used to come here all the time during my community college days and order the lasagna with a long island iced tea. Those were definitely the days. Now I have to worry about cholesterol and sugar content. Pfft. Anyway, the back area is catered more toward families and larger groups and it has plenty of arcade games for the kids. They also sell gelato in the back game area.

In general, beer and other adult friendly drinks are cheap here and most of their menu is comfort food. My favorites include their lasagna, pizza, and cheesy bread! Ask for a side of Frank's Red Hot to dip the cheesy bread, it's amazing.<//Text>

< Review>
Horrible the restaurant part seems to cater to senior citizen. The clam chowder was potatoe chowder the friday lunch special was tasteless.  Waitress Kathy was rude to the 7 power.  This was my first time and my last time. Wouldnt recommend to a  homeless person. Really want to rate zero .<//Review>

Great place. The Original seating area is cozy. Darcy is a great waitress that always says hello to me even if I'm not seated in her area. There's a bar with tv to watch games.
The new Area can be a little loud (at busy times) but its a great large area, able to seat lots of large 8-10 peeps tables. Tv's for games. Pool tables & arcade games. My son loves playing after eating, allows us adults to relax & chat so we domt have to leave right away.
Pizza is Very very good. Lasagna is good. Family makes cannolis fresh. The Wings, yes the wings are very tasty. Many choices of Wing sauce, we usually get them on the side.
Great Staff also. Food is served pretty timely.< /text>

<Review>The management was completely unprofessional and disrespectful. I will never book a party at La Bella’s again.

I made a reservation for 3 tables at 2:00 pm in the new game center side of La Bella’s for Saturday November 22, 2014 for my daughters end of season soccer party. I arrived a little early at approx. 1:30 in which I was told my reservation was not until 2:30 however 2 tables were available and I was able to prep the cake table and setup our trophies. I asked the manager (James) when the third table would be ready as there was a party occupying the table and he said it would be available by 2:30. I was not exactly pleased with my party having to wait 30 minutes for our table but let it go as our entire party had not arrived yet. As it got closer to 2:30 I again asked our assigned waitress as to when the party was expected to depart in which she said they only had the tables until 2:30 and ensured me my reservation was for 3 tables.

Once the party left and the table was cleaned and set my party occupied the table. About 15 minutes later the Manager James came and informed me that I did not make reservations for 3 tables but 2 and we needed to move. I argued that I in fact made reservations for 3 tables and knew for a fact that we were expecting 35-40 people (each table seated only 15) and needed at least 3 tables. He said we HAD to move. He was very unapologetic and when I said I would give a bad review for this online he shrugged his shoulders and rolled his eyes and said he didn’t care (great for business!). He then made our party move from the table. We had to eat in shifts so everyone had a chance to sit down to enjoy their food.

The party that was seated at our third reserved table also complained to the same Manager (James) because they had made a reservation for more people than the 15 seat table could seat in which James responded “can’t the parents go sit somewhere else.” REALLY! They informed us that they made reservations for room in the back of the restaurant which another party was in. They kicked us out of our reserved table because they made a mistake!

We were offered no apologies by management whatsoever for the inconvenience. I apologized to the waitress and let her know I knew it was not her fault when she responded “Don’t worry this happens every Saturday.” Well at least they are consistent! I am team mom for my daughters team and will never bring our team parties to this establishment nor will I ever recommend this establishment to any other teams.< /Review>< user_name>

You are met upon entry by a cacophony of joyous rambunctious jubilation. why not, it's some of the best pizza around and their chicken wings are something extraordinary, not to mention a friendly staff, good prices, parking is a bit shaky but what are you going to do.<//Text>

You are met upon entry by a cacophony of joyous rambunctious jubilation. why not, it's some of the best pizza around and their chicken wings are something extraordinary, not to mention a friendly staff, good prices, parking is a bit shaky but what are you going to do.</review>

<text>The management was completely unprofessional and disrespectful. I will never book a party at La Bella’s again.

I made a reservation for 3 tables at 2:00 pm in the new game center side of La Bella’s for Saturday November 22, 2014 for my daughters end of season soccer party. I arrived a little early at approx. 1:30 in which I was told my reservation was not until 2:30 however 2 tables were available and I was able to prep the cake table and setup our trophies. I asked the manager (James) when the third table would be ready as there was a party occupying the table and he said it would be available by 2:30. I was not exactly pleased with my party having to wait 30 minutes for our table but let it go as our entire party had not arrived yet. As it got closer to 2:30 I again asked our assigned waitress as to when the party was expected to depart in which she said they only had the tables until 2:30 and ensured me my reservation was for 3 tables.

Once the party left and the table was cleaned and set my party occupied the table. About 15 minutes later the Manager James came and informed me that I did not make reservations for 3 tables but 2 and we needed to move. I argued that I in fact made reservations for 3 tables and knew for a fact that we were expecting 35-40 people (each table seated only 15) and needed at least 3 tables. He said we HAD to move. He was very unapologetic and when I said I would give a bad review for this online he shrugged his shoulders and rolled his eyes and said he didn’t care (great for business!). He then made our party move from the table. We had to eat in shifts so everyone had a chance to sit down to enjoy their food.

The party that was seated at our third reserved table also complained to the same Manager (James) because they had made a reservation for more people than the 15 seat table could seat in which James responded “can’t the parents go sit somewhere else.” REALLY! They informed us that they made reservations for room in the back of the restaurant which another party was in. They kicked us out of our reserved table because they made a mistake!

We were offered no apologies by management whatsoever for the inconvenience. I apologized to the waitress and let her know I knew it was not her fault when she responded “Don’t worry this happens every Saturday.” Well at least they are consistent! I am team mom for my daughters team and will never bring our team parties to this establishment nor will I ever recommend this establishment to any other teams.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

After waiting for an hour and a half for a table that we were told would take no longer than 40 min, my girlfriend and three young children were placed into a booth where not even the waiters knew what was going on. We had our first waiter who took our drink order then left. right after him we had another waiter come by and ask for our drink order. with her we placed our appitizer order. we then had to flag her down later to place our food order. while waiting for our meal a child pulled the fire alarm and the staff as a whole had no idea what to do. if there had been a real fire we would have all probably died because the staff sat around joking and laughing while the alarm was going off. it was aroung this time that we saw our original waiter bussing tables, that would explain the wait for the table and our food that we could see in the kitchen are. once our food arrived it was less that subpar and gave us all stomach aches the next day. when i approached to manager about it he had an excuse for everything and compted my drinks and appitizer very unhappy with this place now. if i go to drink and play games maybe but i'd rather go somewhere else.</Text>

This place is a crapshoot. Sometimes the pizza here is ok, but the pizza we got delivered today was undercooked, doughy, pasty, and just lukewarm. After it was in my oven at 400° for 15 minutes, it was less gross, but still not good.< /text>

HORRIBLE place!!! The customer service was awful! And this new kid messed up our order after we kept asking him to go ask for help. So then we called after we got our food and of course it was all messed up. the maniager for on the phone, his name was Patrick and he apologized and also said that he would take care of it and then we could order again on them while we were still in town So we called the next day to order and Patrick got on the phone and told me it was a $6 credit after we spent over $30 the night before and tried to act like someone else was the one that did it. $6?!? Really!!!! And not to mention this joke of a manager(Patrick) was so rude and just hung up the phone. NEVER ORDER FROM HERE, EVER!<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Good place to enjoy with the kids but the place needs more waiters to keep more clean the areas.
Good place to hang out with the Nino's but they need more servers to keep the place cleaner.

(Translated by Google) Delicious food, in the menu they already offer packages already thought:
We ordered one consisting of Salad 🥗 Caesar, Pizza🍕 MARGARITA, Very rich Pasta by the way, Wings and 2 jugs of Soda.
We went to celebrate a birthday, and since it was a weekday we considered Bella Pizza to be a GOOD OPTION.
There is also Fun for ALL Ages, pool tables, and all kinds of slot machines that mostly cost 50 ¢ per game
A rich and pleasant experience!

(Original)
Rica comida, en el menú ya ofrecen paquetes ya pensados:
Nosotros pedimos uno que consiste de Ensalada 🥗 César, Pizza🍕 MARGARITA, Pasta muy rica por cierto, Alitas y 2 jarras de Soda .
Fuimos a celebrar un cumpleaños, y como era entre semana consideramos que Bella Pizza era una Buena OPCIÓN.
Además hay Diversión para TODAS las Edades, mesas de billar, y todo tipo de maquinitas que en su mayoría sale en 50¢ por juego
Una Rica y Grata experiencia!< /text>
