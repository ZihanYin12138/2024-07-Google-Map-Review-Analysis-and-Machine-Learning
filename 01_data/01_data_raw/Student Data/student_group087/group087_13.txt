Located in a strip mall this place leaves a lot to be desired for the prices they charge.

CONS: Service was slow and server forgetful.
Had to ask for a fork and drinks twice. One she took orders only came back once to ask if anything else was needed and there was only 2 other couples there eating.
To get to the restrooms you have to walk thru a service area where food is located and the men's room opens directly into that area!!!
The restrooms are disgusting. Caked in grime along edges and corners of restroom floor.
Food was just ok.. probably better at Panda Express or anywhere else.

PROS
The chef was great and friendly</text>

Absolutely the best and my favorite place.  Everything is made fresh.  I want to keep this place a secret,  but it's not fair.  Far above all other all you can eat places.< /text>

<Review>I've eaten here many times over the last 15 years I've lived in OC. The food is always delicious, well cooked and seasoned if you're after the teppan fare, and the staff is super friendly. I wish I could do more for this business than leave a positive review but this place is a pillar of the community and deserves all the support in the world in these hard times.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I am absolutely blown away that this place has 4 stars.. I live right down the street and decided to stop and get some sushi to-go. $35.00 and 25 minutes later, I finally leave with 5 different rolls. Get to the house and immediately notice a funny smell coming from the boxes. I proceed against my better judgment and immediately spit it out. EACH AND EVERY ROLL TASTE LIKE PLASTIC. Both I and my buddy tried each roll and couldn't stomach the taste enough to even swallow the roll... Half the fish was discolored or obviously dyed, The rice was undercooked.  There was a plastic smell and taste, in each and every roll. (It is hard to describe, but trust me, it was not edible) All in All. Huge waste of $35.00 and time. Will never recommend or step foot in this location again.  I recommend everyone does the same unless you want food poisoning...</Text>

I always enjoy (eat too much!) my experience when I come here. Steve and Jun are friendly and they make you feel at home. We like the sushi so much we have never tried the tepan or regular menu. This is my go to sushi joint.< /text>

A very good fresh experience.  The fish was cut fresh for each order, unlike many other restaurants that have started precutting fish before they get busy.  They also spread out orders to keep a constant flow instead of serving everything at once.  Very good experience.  Enjoy some green tea ice cream for dessert.</Review>

Great little neighborhood restaurant. Grew up with it down the street from my home growing up.  Reasonable prices. Great food. Teppanyaki and Sushi!! You want bougie  fancy?! Go overpay at Benihana!! Never had a bad experience in 44 yrs.  Family place with a good friendly atmosphere!! The “Cheers” of a local neighborhood Japanese restaurant.<//review>

Not what it used to be. I went here many times until I moved to Seattle 15 years ago. Been a long time. Visited recently, and was disappointed in the lack of show. No fancy knife tricks, no big flame no funny jokes. Nothing. Just cooking. It was alright, but the steak was dry< /Text>

The fried rice is amazing as well as most of the teppan dishes. The sushi was not great though. Just average and the rolls we ordered were slightly worse.</text>

Lived up the reviews. Big on fish, small on rice, and nicely made and presented too. Very good value with kids eating at half the cost of adults. Wish we lived closer but will definitely stop there again the next time we are heading to LAX.</Review>

The best and my most favorite Japanese teppan bar in town.  Good prices and great food.  I have been going there for 30 years and even though they have had a change of ownership over the years, the food has NEVER been less than perfect.  I always get the Hibachi Steak and Shrimp.  Comes with a generous New York Steak and around 6 - 8 shrimp.  Stir fried vegetables with bean sprouts, miso soup and I top it off with a frosty bottle of Kirin beer.  I'm so very hungry now...<//review>

Wow..... I really thought that the food would be better tasting. The portions are large but the flavor is pretty plain! The service lacks extremely..... Our server just sat around and did not care to give any customers attention.. She had a frown the whole time we were there.

I would pass on this restaurant and find another one around the area. .<//text>

The selection and pricing of what is offered (sushi and traditional Japanese eatery) was definitely fair for what they offered in terms of quantity, but was definitely lacking in quality.

Overall anything cooked from this place is good; however, with lack of good central air or great refrigeration for their fish, I would err on the side of caution when getting their raw sushi, especially on a hot day.

Entering the restaurant, the temperature inside was definitely a problem as it was hardly different from the outside (~100 °F).

As it was so hot outside and in, the effect of the heat was completely noticeable on the sushi. Overall the cut rolls offered were fine as any major fish flaw was covered up by their pairing and combination of sauces and seasoning; however, all nigiri served was questionable in edibility and quality. From first taste you can completely tell that the fish is "dead." It lacked flavour and freshness and felt almost as if the fish was old and stale. The nigiri also fell short at the fact that the fish itself felt luke warm and not chilled (as if the fish was left in the outside sun).</Review>< pics>

Fresh! made to order sushi! all you can eat at a fraction of the price of your downtown sushi joints!.. The decor isn't much to look at but the sushi, the chefs, the value and the service is awesome!

The sushi and sashimi are excellent. Whether you order the all you can eat or individual items from the menu, you will not be disappointed. Everything is fresh. My favorite role is the Stinky Garlic Shrimp roll.< /Text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><pictures>None< /pictures><review>I was hungry for a sushi snack and called in.  they said lunch was all you can eat. so i waited till i had more time to enjoy a full sushi meal. When i finally stopped in i was surprised at the empty teppan tables ( ill have to go back during evening for that) and the sushi bar semi full of customers.. looking over the all you can eat menu was impressive it had a nice variety especially for the price which is a couple dollars less than most places I've been for all you can eat . looking around as we waited for our order the restaurant was decorated OK, but it could use a remodeling, (the floor, ceiling and walls have an aged look, a few new ceiling tiles and a fresh coat of paint would be an improvement). the food was nice. all the sushi was fresh and full flavored  , the octopus was prepared perfectly and wasn't overcooked or rubbery at all for example.  there is a good verity of rolls as well.  overall it was a nice experience and i plan on returning repeatedly for more of my delicious favorites of sushi< /review>< user_id>

Terrible visit! We came to Sagami Tei for a family reunion. They sat us together and we told them that some of us wanted all you can eat and some of us didn't. Now after telling us it was ok to all sit together one of the older ladies came back, after some time had passed and told us they had to split us up anyway and not just next to each other in the booth one over, but like all the way across the restaurant split us up! They said that it was their policy for AYCE eaters to sit closer to the sushi bar, even though they told us it was alright. I'm assuming so they could spy on us. I just felt like if our families wanted to eat at separate restaurants we wouldn't have gone out together. The whole point of a family reunion is the get together, ooooo my husband was so pissed he started to walk out. We totally would have but we all had small, hungry children with us. So we ate at opposite ends of the place! This is not how you should run a business if you wanna STAY in business in my opinion. Smh.</text>

<review>My boyfriend and I have been here three times just to give it a chance.
This place doesnt even deserve one star. The food is ok, the service is horrible. Takes forever to get your food while the sushi chef behind the counter stands there and stares around the room or is too busy talking to other staff in the back. The wait staff doesnt give anyone the time of day and just stand around watching the TV.
The last time we went there we got seated in the corner of the sushi bar. There were nats flying around the bar and our food the whole time we had to keep swatting them away. Dont even get me started on all the dust and cobb webs. We wont be returning, we really wanted to like this place.< /review><user_id>101887691915707885017< /user_id>< time>

<text>I have been here atleast 30 times and the food is good for the money. Yesterday went in with the family for a birthday and it was absolutly terrible.
1. Called ahead for seating when we arrived they did not have enough seats
2. The server was really slow to the point we had to leave without eating after 45 min.
3. He called him self the manager but acted like a 12 year old

If you want good sushi and good service we ended up @ TOSHIS  they are on magnolia & talbert
way way better all around experience.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I'd actually give this a zero if it was possible. The fish was meh but the service took forever. People that camenin after us got served before us. And the servers basically wouldn't give us the time of day. Forget this place.</Text>

Wow, the food was incredible! I was at the beach for the day and looking for a place with vegan options. Ordered the vegan chicken tacos and was floored at how good they were. Chips and guac were bomb too but those tacos!! Seriously, I would drive back just for those!< /Review>

<Review>100% recommend. Food is nominal and but priced right. HUGE shout out to the owner. This person cares about their business!

We were there during an off day and cold + covid restrictions.
Owner closed early as there was no traffic/business in the evening.
We were too involved with our conversation to notice but the owner stayed for what seemed like an hour or more until we left.
When we got up she politely asked us to help move in the table for her and let us know why she had asked us. It was then we realized she had been there waiting for us. Greatly appreciated!
This is a new spot a will visit frequently when I am in the area.<//Review>< pictures>

**NOT VEGAN /VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY**
Ordered the "Vegetarian Nachos", asked to switch chips for Fries. Instead they got the order all wrong giving us Asada Nachos. I asked for a refund and was denied, the owner started arguing with my friend and I then went around the counter herself to take out 15$ for us to go away. Also asked for no sour cream.. rude cause I cant have dairy. This place was sooo unprofessional.<//Text>

Vegan-friendly restaurant, owner has been in business for 20 years and is a vegan herself. No chicken stock or fat used, they sell vegan ice-cream, etc. etc.  The food is DELICIOUS, great service, I would highly recommend.<//text>

Combination of authentic Mexican along with a few American favorites. Food was delivered fast at a good price. The employees were nice. Nothing to complain about at this small, seaside, Mexican restaurant.< /text>

Small taco shop. Awesome location, right off the beach. Prices were reasonable for the location. Portions were good, speed was a bit slow, food tasted great. They prefer cash, but they take card as well.</Text>

Food was OK. Pretty greasy, small portions. They will lie to you and say they don’t take American Express because their “machine is old”...until you walk away. Then, magically, they are able to take it.<//review>

Great service. Great quality food. Tastes authentic although the salsa could be spicier but I guess for the clientele in this area, it's good. Definitely recommend this place for a quick bite :P</text>

<text>More like a taco stand with a few seats and really good food at a fair price. We ordered a set of tacos, chicken burrito, chicken quesadilla and steak burrito. Everyone thought their food was very good and the location is perfect for taking the food down to the beach. The service is very friendly but with only one cook it can be slow.< /text>< user>

The cashier was honestly like real dumb I don’t know how else to put it nicely, when I got there there was a family waiting because she had gave them the wrong change or forgot it I don’t know. I ordered really simple drink and somehow she managed to actually mess it up I felt bad for her at first but I see the problem.<//Text>

I love both our Jamba Juice locations here in Stockton! But, I must give props to our March Ln one. Emmanuel is always top of his game, when I come here, whether I order inside or online. He goes the extra mile to provide great service! To all the other staff members as well, I always feel welcome when entering AND when leaving. Even during this COVID-19 crises, with the sign on the door as to how many people can be in at once, they do a great job POLITELY getting people to follow these rules. Keep up the awesome work, you all! I love the great personalities and professionalism here! Great hiring on the part of the hiring manager!</Text>

<Review>I frequent this Jamba Juice every week and the staff had improved greatly. Before the customer service was sub par, but recently the stores have been more inviting and lively. The staff is extra courteous and helpful. I look forward to my visit each time.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpwgSsqX2J_W_l3DRHB-d0PYDgLe_9CMuYKK8L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNomPXkCs9d0qsFghYV0ybMT5iHPxYOyxMwSdwA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

<text>You know I usually like Jamba Juice and from a service perspective they were spot on! However I tried the new Electric Berry Breeze and what began as a wonderful burst of berries turned into your least favorite pop cycle in the twin pop bag. You know the one you eat on the hot day, only because it's hot and you need something cold to cool you off, but it doesn't have much flavor. You would not be eating it, but it's 103 outside and you need something to cool you off. Of course you discover this loss of flavor on your way home so it's too late to complain but you are super unhappy with your choice...yep this was my last trip to Jamba Juice...< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

They are great at the service they provide, also their drinks are pretty amazing. The only suggestions I would make is:
1: Customer service needs a little more work.
2: Pay more attention to detail to the orders.
(Our drinks were marked wrong)
Having to make suggestions -1 Star
Other than that, keep up the wonderful work guys.<//Review>

To the owner;
Thanks for your concern. This is not a reflection on your facility as a whole. Its just my experience at this one.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80900c2c16180947:0x2e34316b53802246< /gmap_id></record>

Very fast service, however constantly gets my order wrong. Could slow down since the place is empty when I’m there. The customer service is good though. Two stars because I’m sick of my incorrect orders. :/<//Text>

<Text>The place runs from 75 to 80 USD a night, so it's affordable. I stayed two nights and it was safe. The rooms have cable, flat screen TV, fridge, microwave, and has lots of mirrors around the bed. Very good for people going to fashion district.<//Text>< time>

I've never been a guess there,but a good friend of mine has. It looked pretty clean and it's currently being remodel so it might actually end up being a good little spot to stay in after its complete.<//Review>

But if you pay a little extra u can have your own bathroom & shower.... Great Mexican food nearby  & there's a pool hall downstairs with some  nice señoritas inside ... & if they like you .... You might get lucky & 1 of them will come up to the room...

<Review>Yummy, fast and friendly, and nicely priced. Boba milk tea (black) is perfect! Not too sweet, strong tea flavor and perfect boba texture. Pineapple smoothie is sooooo good!< /Review>< Rating>

Anyways... The drinks are cheap and the tables are less. Usually crowded (in the back) between 3pm to 6pm, because thats when the students be off from school. Also this place has free WiFi if you are wondering.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3R9xruoxNf9NUfi8UR68E0Yc5FNnrd0SzE9_7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEaKoeyXNgK1RbMCRBzDB60IlJOiFWrbbINoZO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2da51316139e3:0x75530d92a4d98311< /GmapID></record>

<Text>Yo this place is hella good. The drink aren’t expensive, the old man is super nice, the food was good. I know its probably frozen food but his house spicy sauce is amazing.

Tried and true! Boba express was the boba store of my childhood, and it’s the best place ever. I love Brenda so much! And their drinks are delicious!< /text>

It was made with real fruit also so it was worth the price of $4.10 with tax. Also, the lady who took my order and made my drink was really friendly and made my drink pretty fast. And she filled my cup quite a lot. It is cash only here which is kind of inconvenient but overall, very good service and quality! Definitely coming back again soon!<//Text>< rating>

<Text>I used to come here to study and do my work. You can get in by it front and back door. I like their boba milk tea, honey green tea with boba and iced coffee. Cash only. The owner is always friendly to me. Recommend this place!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

(Translated by Google) Boba milk tea, very tea scent, it is worth a drink! Of course there are other products, the boss is very kind, I will always have a cup when I pass by, chat with the boss, by the way, she is very human!

(Original)
波霸奶茶，很有茶香味，值得一喝哦! 當然還有其他的產品，老闆娘很親切，我路過的時候總會來一杯，順便跟老闆娘聊聊天，她很有人情味!😋👍< /review>

I enjoy my time there and want to go back to try what I wanted to order... so many good things it was hard to decide.....<//review>

Comfort food in the heart of the Tower district.  Plenty of parking on the west side of the building.  Fresh baked chicken pies all day,  either for here or to go.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnQIMe59Yg9nIlhJeruFuaGxy4xg70it_ABi8K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuFDM6AgsOcDWHWgmSBQ4QXwbiP_hyVbbQ7-2t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhHEXerN2xGs63UeBsQPy322Mh_B0Sa4DyCcTP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPJ0DY-rmZIYJW_8PWSTg2PD0vVmP-1jIq0bMh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7GDxk2qvKtwRlEUFehuRH87LwDJt1-rvRwXjW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-PafAL7K2IaVqjXMLHG0LNGnLw34ehF82yAGi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9Fg-LVwbfF-Ev8mgYLSQq74kzIhY82IwW3her=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNX-y7ghiQPF91UZxvFnQhooNLRI77R8fY9EJvV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFpmoJvk49vwA_1IwYpeoxKNSAnAPmQNMud4l3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWdMjWN4oQjkoH0apzkvbSws57KQ2Bxf2H7_mS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOeNN3u2tP0jchCiKM0_ZbwWgoWabr9WcjOJ-0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Can't tell you about the food because we left after waiting for over an hour for our breakfast, and the place was almost empty as you can see in the pictures. We just paid for our drinks and left, not worth our time and frustration.< /Review>< pics>

The staff was very easy to speak with. The portions are perfect, even for a big eater like me. The coleslaw was great, probably some of the best I've had and I've been eating home coleslaw recipes for 28 years. I like that they used the same gravy for the pie as the potatoes. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for something wholesome and conventional.<//text>

Things have definitely changed with this business, sadly. Dinner no longer includes dessert due to costs! Chicken pot pie size is at least 20% smaller than it used to be - but with the same price!

I would recommend you go to Casa Corona for a nice hearty Mexican meal, instead!< /review>< date>

<text>This place needs new cook management. I went for am interview. Everything went great. But I had history with the cook. Personal history. I feel someone like that will sabotage my way into a good job. I am more than qualified for this cook position. I believe this is also a reason for food not being up to quality of expectations. Very petty as well. Great place. I think they just need someone else with less of a chip towards the world in order to get up to par.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Best chicken pies around! The staff is wonderful, I Love their server Kathy to pieces! Their Banana Cream Pies and Chocolate Creme Pies are the best. Get the Chicken Pie Dinner, it's definitely the best deal on the menu! They have rice pudding that is just like mom used to make and the bread pudding is to die for.< /Review>

The best chicken pot pies you will EVER EAT! The place is a real throwback in time when "homemade" was the norm in the resturant business. Their chicken dinners are great too! Fun place to eat lunch!< /text>

One of the best restaurants in town for home cooked food. The best chicken pot pies ever . Highly recommend those. The best biscuits and jelly. The best breakfast! Love the bacon and eggs or the omelets or the bacon scramble. A lovely jem local spot in town. Best ever. Must try! Been going here since i was a little girl.< /Review>

Some have said the vintage decor',etc. puts them off,but we love that Chicken Pie Shop is not the run-of-the-mill,overpriced,trendy eatery.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>My wife and I did fell like we waited awhile for the order but when it came we did enjoy it. The chicken pot pie was tastey, I believe it has some white pepper in it. The restaurant is very large and would work well with large groups.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80946751fe2a442d:0x15ab387f294a1f01</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I have only had the chicken pot pie. It was sooo good. The crust is flaky and perfectly baked.< /text>

I love this place! I came here with my dad  many times when I was a kid, and now I have taken my son here too. He got a kick out of the decor, and I got a throwback to my childhood! Of course, we had the chicken pie dinner. Still as delicious as I remember, and I was happy that my son not only enjoyed his meal but was full too.</Text>

<Text>Kathy, our server was great. Waited a long time and it wasn’t that busy. Breakfast was terrible, half cooked hash browns, served cold. Gravy was sour, biscuits and eggs were good. Owner needs to replace the cooks. I mean breakfast is a no brainer!!  very very disappointed.< /Text>< response>

One of the few things I miss about Fresno. You could constantly count on these chicken pot pies being as yummy as they were the day or week or year before. I'm saddened to hear the owner wants to sell it. I hope they keep it the way it is.</review>

This place has been here since my childhood I'm an adult now and it still looks the same and the chicken pot pies are heavenly. You can eat them there or take them home and bake them there.</Review>

Remember when your $30 car wash package included interior cleaning (dash, doors)— well that service isn’t included and is now a “detail” for and additional $30 more.  And since the Prices aren’t posted, I had to ask for the menu.  You do get a vacuum service and they will “dust your dash” …
I asked about the changes (just curious) and they informed that they’re “corporate” now. Nice employees. I just didn’t like that the pricing and what you got for the price was so vague.<//review>

I wouldn’t even give it one star. I signed up for the monthly membership as I just purchase a brand new car. I got the wash and the inside looked great. When I  went home I realized that the trim around the tires was still completely covered in dirt. I called and spoke with the young lady at customer service. She was short, rude and stated that was not a service they provided. I was confused as this was clearly visible from 10 feet away of the car. I would assume anything visible would be considered part of the wash. I drove back to the location and spoke the manager. He seemed apologetic and had the car washed again while stating that he apologizes because his workers “don’t know what they are doing”.  Car was still dirty around the tires. The worker was kind enough to use a rag to quickly wipe down the area.... Well unsatisfied but grateful they re washed the car as I still had to go home to completely clean the area.... it gets worse. I soon after realize there is a long scratch on the right side from the rear tail light to halfway the passenger door. It was in a wave motion to where when it was being dried with a dirty towel, it scratched the car. Took the car back and spoke to the manager. He was unapologetic and didn’t seem to care. Said it wasn’t their fault... Truly worst customer service and lack of professionalism. My car is less than two months old with a large scratch across the passenger side. Completely disappointed and frustrated with this experience.</text>

<Review>Not a good wash, especially for $24.00 actually it was pretty bad. After 5 minutes off the wash Line they said ready. Road grime, bugs on bumper still on dude don't even bother raising the wipers to clean under them. Asked to get cleaned and was told I need a wax service. Manager tried to make it right but honestly even then, still not good. This is my first and last. This wash was as good as a $3.00 gas station automated wash. But with ArmorAll'd tires.

Don't waste your time.< /Review>< pictures>

Went in for car wash. Paid for service #2. They took same amount of time as they would for basic car wash. I doubt they did brake dust removal, undrbody wash and I didn't smell any fragrance in the interior of my car. They need to make sure employees are aware when customer pays extra for sevices.<//Text>

<Review>I wouldn’t give a start at all if I could. I paid $60+ dollars or something for a good car wash and instead got a greasy car inside. My touch screen un cleaned, dust left behind. No surprise they finished in 20 minutes maybe when I hadn’t washed my car in months ! I would of asked for a refund and get my car properly washed but they’re not even worth except their review.<//Review>< Pics>

Apparently it's a la cart, as I was told they don't clean rims, even though I paid 60 dollars for inside outside cleaning. The smerk on the kids face will make sure I never go back, check out their work, they weren't even busy
I'm just to busy to put up with sub par service< /Review>

I spent $110 for a hand wash & wax, all I got was water spots & scratches with a dirty bed of my truck. I have 4 deep scratches on my truck now, & it looks dirtier me leaving than coming in. I want my money back<//Text>

I took my car in today and paid 25 dollars what I remember they use to do a pretty good job. Walked out today very disappointed . They finished too quick and didn't even clean the inside they left it pretty bad . Windows all spotted . Even my daughter said " REALLY MOM ITS STILL DIRTY" . Couldn't even say they were busy place had 2 customers before me . 😞</review>

<Review>Be careful with your stuff at this place. The first time i found something missing from My car here i gave them the benefit of the doubt. Now this second time its like “really”. They do a nice job car wash and oil change but having this happen really brings a customer down.  Things should not be going missing.< /Review>< username>

<review>Apparently it's a la cart, as I was told they don't clean rims, even though I paid 60 dollars for inside outside cleaning. The smerk on the kids face will make sure I never go back, check out their work, they weren't even busy

I brought my car to get the interior washed. My dash board my air vents were dirty ! On top of that I brought my car in with no lights on at all on my dash and I get it back and my air bag censor was on ! The second manager kept saying it wasn’t them there was no way but then how did my light turn on ! My husband and I have been coming here for years and all of a sudden this business is trash! Do not come here!  The second manager Mario was super rude told me to quote “use common sense” so rude. Not professional</text>

<Text>This use to be my every week car wash for my three vehicles about twelve years ago. Even they broke things in my cars a couple of times back then, I still visited them because they use to do a decent job in cleaning them. I stopped going here about five years ago because of them getting very sloppy. Within the last five years I took one of my cars here about five times to kind of find out if they've gotten better, but I guess they didn't because I visited them on Monday 10, 2020 and they've even gotten worse, my car looked like it was washed/cleaned by a five year old. Without mentioning the clerk's attitude. Horrible. I don't think I'll even consider this place as my last resource. Too bad businesses like this that started doing a good job, end up this way. I wasn't going to write a review but I was really disappointed when I saw how bad they've gotten.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Paid 60 dollars for a wax on my exterior and it wasn't worth 60 dollars. Came back for my free wash and got lectured by an older worker for not going to the cashier first, it was a simple mistake and I got it fixed but he still lectured me when I got back. Bad customer service and pushy upsells that aren't worth it.< /text>< rating>

< Review>
The fact that they asked me for my address to save in their system for a simple oil change with out giving me a proper reason other than "We need it for your recipe." is concerning. I don't know about you but I will not put myself in a situation where my identity is at risk. They didn't even have a paper to state that my information will be safe and will not be sold to 3rd party companies. I left! Don't become a victim of possible identity theft at this place.< /Review>

Worst service ever. $25 for nothing. They didn't even vacuum the car in a decent way. $5 tip just because the guy was waiting for it. But the car is dirty inside/out, a Clorox wipe would work better than this place.

Got home and saw that my car was not wiped down dry even the inside was not wiped clean. Regretted giving $5 tip so I went back to complain and supervisor called  2 guys to fix what the 1st guy failed to do.

<review>I just paid 160 dollars for an exterior and interior wash that came with a wax job. I was told the car had water spots that weren't gonna be able to be removed unless I paid 70 more for something they had to do with acid in order to remove the stains when I refused he brought it down to 50 in the end I said no and was given the car with the water stains in the front bumper. I went home to simply get some wax I had and removed the stains myself.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user_id>108601159808251318091</user_id><Resp>None< /Resp>< Time>

<Text>First off if I could have given 0 stars I would have! Took my car to have a regular wash,  I was then convinced by one of their workers to have it detailed and waxed for 59.99 which I agreed to. Being that the job was done so quickly and by the looks of it (still had dirt and smudge marks) I questioned what exactly was done to it. The worker couldn't seem to give me a direct answer and just said it had been put through the machine. After regretfully giving a generous tip I came and realized the "wash and so called wax job" was worse than I thought. Clearly upset I called to speak to the manager although I was unable to speak to him I explained the situation and was told if I left a my name and number a manager by the name of Mario would get back to me. A whole day after and still no phone call. I regret taking my car in for a "wash" at Mission car wash, and I should have known better due to the fact that this was not the first time I've dealt with something similar at this same car wash. I feel that I was taken advantage of and do not appreciate how unprofessional they are, and could not even return my call. Super dissatisfied and will never have my business again.< /Text><UserId.>104912463454178760939< /UserId.>< pics>

<rating>1<//rating><review>So I've been bringing my cars here for oil changes for a few years now. Decent oil change, nothing special and it comes with a basic wash. So I decided to get the 60$ wash and wax as a treat and honestly it was worse than the basic one. There was still a bunch of dirt on my car and steaks of the black wax that I didn't notice until I got home but the more I checked the worse it looked. It also looked like they barely even dusted off the inside which they usually wipe down. Overall just a shoddy job and I will no longer be reconnecting this place. Will not be going back.</review>< Pictures>

My local car wash, I come here all the time. They have an unlimited wash program that us well worth it if you use it. The only issue I see is that they sometimes rush through the drying of the cars. But other then that, they get the job done<//review>

So after talking to the guy for the best price for my car since I only really needed a clean in the inside of the vehicle since it’s A NEW CAR  CLEANED I go to the cash register for the guy to tell me that he suggested for me to get a package that cost $24.99 instead AFTER HE CHARGED ME ALMOST $40 FOR THE CAR WASH I DIDNT NEED! THEY WASHED IT ANYWAYS! WHEN I ASKED IT HE COULD CHANGE HE JUST SORRY I ALREADY CHARGED YOU CANT DO NOTHING. “OH OK THANK YOU LAST TIME I GO HERE”

I had an unfortunate experience with this car wash group this morning. I went for a car wash because my windshield wipers don't have the rubber on the blade. I specifically told them NOT TO USE the windshields for that reason. Now, I don't know if that information was relayed to the other men outside (there were about 5), but upon driving I started to notice specks and white looking smears--at first I thought it was just because it was not cleaned properly, but upon gazing closer, I realized that they were indeed scratches and little specs of glass were falling. Now, I understand things happen, and perhaps it was an accident, but the manager very defensively straight out said, "there's nothing we can do..." Ummmmm very rude and highly unprofessional. There are more things I can critique him on, but perhaps that would be unprofessional of me as well. Feedback however, should never be taken and responded with a, "there's nothing we can do". Not even an apology was inserted in the repetitious words the manager was using. I asked my boyfriend, who comes here religiously, if he's ever noticed workers using windshields to clean the windows and his reply was yes, they have used them in the past. SO now I'm very upset at and distrusting of them because I strongly suspect this was done as a result of taking it to people that I specifically instructed and unfortunately trusted them. Once again, I specifically made it clear not to use them but I don't know if this was said to the rest of the "team". In addition, they tried to tell me that perhaps the automatic windshield wipers went off. My model year is a 2009 and I have it set on manual (the right side of the flickering switch not the left switch where automatic lights are).....that was the second strike because that was their attempt to present their alternative cause to the problem. As a behavior analyst, I see this as poor communication and a lack of set contingencies on their workers (this reflects the manager, not the workers). This wasn't my first time being dissatisfied with their services, but this truly is a big disturbance, as evidence of this post. I hope to get in touch with their superior to talk about the manager and his response. Nonetheless, I hope they change for the better.<//Review>< rating>

I had a 2 car monthly pass but they got really sloppy so I cansoled my membership. They can use better management to inspect the finished product.sometimes the car will dry it self just by sitting in the sun and hasn't been dry so you have to tell them get all the water spots off your car .not good that tells you they are not paying attention to what they are doing...< /Review>

<Name>Casey Rocke</Name>< review>
Staff is very nice, place is well kept... but I spent $125 for a #1 wash & Super Shine Detail waxing and when I got home (2.8 miles away) I had to redo the windows, clean old bird poop from high on the back window, wipe down the floor mats, clean around the edges of the trunk and vacuum the hard to reach area between the seat & the door.

I just get really frustrated that I can never go to a business near my house in Sylmar because they all seem to be staffed by people that are overworked, treated poorly and are miserable at their jobs because of poor management.< /review>

<Text>Car wash service was very poor today and I even paid extra for dash/ door cleaning for very poor service.  Glass window streaked.  Dashboard with finger prints. Dust still on vents. Front fender not cleaned. Not sparkling clean at all. I will not pay for this type of service.<//Text>< rating>

< review>
The cost of a car wash is exaggerated plain and simple too expensive, and they don't do a good job they rush to get the next car to get the tip, I took my BMW and to be honest they didn't do a good job with the vacuum nor the wipe down on the seats or the center compartment I paid for lotion on the seats in the seeds came out looking the same as they do without lotion my final words it's wash the car yourself it'll probably turn out better or simply take it to a different car wash where they take Pride on what they do< /review>

I was a very loyal and happy customer here at Mission Car Wash for years. This morning I took my car to get a car wash it was about $20 when I was called that my car was ready I got into my car and I noticed that the dash was not clean I asked the guy for a towel  so I could do it myself the manager notice that I was cleaning it myself and asked if there was a problem I responded with no problem they just forgot to clean the dash. His response to me was that the $20 car wash that I had gotten doesn't include Dash cleaning and that for another $10.99 they can shampoo my Dash. I told the manager that I have been going there for years and they have always wipe down my Dash I did not like his respond as a customer his job as a manager is to keep me happy and the way he handled the situation was completely wrong I'm not asking for anything free I was just asking for them to clean my Dash like they have for many years so I hope this review can help you make a decision< /Review>

The best car wash in the San Fernando valley! The reason why i love this car wash is because the workers clean every single part such as the cup holders and the trunk of my car and if they miss a spot then the manager has them clean them again. And it's also quick because two workers dry and clean each car. The perfect car wash to go to =D</review>

Beware: if they're unhappy with you voicing a complaint the MANAGER MICHAEL will ask you to leave and threaten to call the police on you.

I took my truck to be washed and they damaged the Father's Day gift I had just purchased and left inside the truck. When I noticed it and went back to complain the following day Michael the manager was dismissive about what had happened. I explained that I had just purchased the gift and it was perfectly fine before visiting the car wash, and upon leaving I left the gift in my truck and didn't touch it again until the following day. Michael swore up and down that it couldn't have been any of the employees there, that they don't have malicious intentions. I understand accidents happen. None the less, GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE would have been to replace what was damaged or at the very least refund the cost of my car wash. Neither option ever came up or out of his mouth. Instead I was asked to leave because I wasn't settling for his answers or I'd have the police called on me.

This car wash has been going downhill for years. Officially done with this place.<//text>

<Review>DO NOT GO HERE UNLESS YOU WISH YOUR CAR TO BE DAMAGED !!! So I can only wish Yelp allowed us to assign 0 (zero) stars. This car wash uses antiquated machinery and does not use hand wash methods like high quality car washes. Despite the use of old machinery - they charge as much as better hand wash - and worse yet they do not stand behind their service. I took my Cayenne into their facility and the old machinery pulled out the gasket trim around my left head light assembly. The gasket was left in pieces - now please understand it went into the Mission Car Wash intact, and had been through hundreds or car washes without a problem - yet Mission's equipment ripped it apart. When I showed the evidence to the store manager - he said I had a faulty car and the trim/gasket was rotted. He then said he would have a representative from the corporation in Bakersfield call me. That person was the Regional Manager (RM) who called me 3 days later. Well RM was no customer service guy - he claimed the gasket was rotted - and scoffed when I said it went in to his machinery fine and come out damaged. THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU. He even refused to refund my $20+ bucks despite my promise to post on Yelp. He said - we don't care what customers say on YELP. Well all I can say is the RM certainly could care less about customers. DO NOT GO HERE UNLESS YOU WISH YOUR CAR TO BE DAMAGED and do not expect the high-paid Regional Manager to give 2 cents!< /Review>< date>

Derated to one star from three stars about a year ago.

Hadn't gone back in quite a while.  Now I remember why.  Place is going downhill like it's on the Mexican overdrive.

Go somewhere else.  You will get a higher quality wash from those automated do-it-yourself car wash.

Most of the employees look like they are not happy.< /review><name>Raf M.</name><time>1540166889869</time></record></dataset><record>

The greeting staff gets 5 stars since they tried to help me close my van back window that suddenly got stuck. They went ahead and sealed it with removable tape. Worked out perfectly! I had to instruct the employee who wiped it down to remove the tape from one of the windows. Because it was hot and I assumed he did a great job with the interior I tipped him $10. Once I looked at the interior I noticed he only did a rush job and didn't use ArmorAll which I paid for. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to discuss it and had to leave. I won't be going back.

They do a good job at a reasonable price.  Know what you want when you pull up, as the initial people you speak to try their hardest to get you to drop a lot of cash on detailing services regardless of what shape your car is in or what you ask for.<//text>

Edit: went back talked to assistant manager after i spoke with mario car was redone and came out better then it was before they still missed a few spots but nothing i couldnt fix 4stars just because i know they did try and was good customer service from managers/owners wouldve 5 stared if was done right first time around

Original reason for 1 star:So i show up ask for the 160 detail car wash. ofcourse get upsold for a "clay bar and wax" special for 200 shouldve left then. But hey while i was waiting they tried to re upsell me for the 280 detail car wash turned it down. Then they kept coming back and telling me i should do it. Shouldve left by then so many red flags. So They do the "200" special when i come back my car seats feel soapy and wet still a stain my passanger seat,cupholder is dirty they got something into a crack of my buttons next to ac. Thats what was wrong with the interior now the exterior. It had waterspots and dirt so much for $40 extra for clay bar and wax<//Review>

Payed 80 bucks for a detail in my interior. It was just drenched in dressing. Found my rear carpet still with trash. Rear cup holder with trash. Dirt and dust left on edge of air vents. Rear bumper was left with dirt on is step. I left couple things on the rear  behind my seat for storage and everything is missing. Sons legos and some other expensive stuff are missing. Searched my truck and nothing. I would understand if I payed twenty or thirty bucks for the wash. But I payed 80. Could of just done a half ass job self<//Text>

Car washes are ok. They don't allow you to put gratuity on your credit card. I find that to be very poor business. So, these hard working guys go without a tip. Not cool. It was suggest we buy something on our debit card and then they can do cash back. Really?! Well, that's convenient for the owner, but not the customer or these hard workers. Smh.<//Text>

<text>Its ok I guess, I wasn't having my car washed, my daughter was having her car detailed, it took awhile but I reckon that's a good thing. The waiting area is ok, I mean its a car wash. They have a few recliner type seats that are comfy and some that are not. All in all, not too bad.< /text></record></dataset><record>

This place use to have great service at reasonable prices. I stopped today for a car wash and man, what a mistake. $50.00 for a manual car wash because I had a truck.  Fine, no problem. Does that include washing my mats and cleaning the inside? No, thats $50.00 more. Huh? I declined and only got my truck washed.

Last time Im showing up.<//Text>

<review>This is the best ripoff ever from a job done the worst way possible. This is the 1ST and LAST time I take my truck to this place call car wash. It's more like car trash. I pay $30+tax to clean my truck and ended up like a $10 car wash or worst. Please don't take you car to this place if U want the job done well. And the people that work there not friendly at all.< /review>< userid>

I have my car shampooed 6 months ago and paid 110 dollars I was told the moldy smell was from the wet shampoo and would go away the next day it never did I figured I would give them an opportunity to rectify the problem and I brought the car back again to have it shampooed I asked for some kind of leniency and was told sorry this is the price if you do not like it you can go down the street and have your car wash somewhere else never spend your money where it is not unappreciated stay away from this place.< /Review>< GmapID>

I work for Lyft and a passenger threw up in my backseat. I went in to get my seats cleaned and the manager told me that it will cost me $500. I told him you have signs all around stating that it's only $52.  I don't know if it was the fact that he didn't want his workers cleaning up throw up but either way it's bad for business when you turn away a customer and lie about the price. I worked as a janitor  and I've clean things worse than throw up. It's a shame that you treat customers this way and you should be ashamed of yourself.</Review>

The worse car wash I ever had!  I paid $22 + tip to get in my car & see my third row seat folded down and my stuff I had organized thrown about. Then I open the hatch and it was full of trash and not vacuumed. Windows smeared AND THEN I realize my entire truck is covered with watermarks and dust!  It looks like they let the sun dry it and left it that way. Not to mention they forgot my air freshener.  I am so upset and will NEVER EVER waste my time or money here again. I want a refund and and I will never be back. Your workers know better than this, this is extremely offensive and upsetting to be taken for granted this way. Lousy service!< /text>

<Review>I paid 45 dollars for wax job and some spots had white stuff on them still and the inside of my car looked like it wasn't cleaned at all. And instead of throwing out my trash they put it all under my seats and my cup holders were still dirty with trash in them. Disappointed and won't go there again. The sales person in the beginning was super pushy and no one likes that. Tried to sell me first some package for 100 dollars that's not the way how unless I ask for something like that.< /Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) They really do not leave it well ..... for what they charge ...... at the moment when they are drying it manually they leave it dirty with their rags body parts in what I was waiting for my car returned two cars again to wash why they did not leave it well pay more attention change your dirty rags more often for clean so that they give bad image

(Original)
En verdad no lo dejan bien..... por lo que cobran ...... al momento cuando lo están secando manual mente lo dejan sucio con sus trapos partes de la carrocería en lo que estaba esperando mi carro regresaron dos carros otraves a lavar por qué no lo dejaron bien pongan más atención cambien más seguido sus trapos sucios por limpios para que den mal imagen<//review>

(Translated by Google) They did not vacuum the back of my car, before taking it, I lifted the car seat for them to do so and not even so! I spoke by phone with a Stephanie who no longer told me that I needed the receipt and told her the receipt they keep it when they deliver the car to you, and then said come and talk to a manager, the person was very rude without any customer service and with a powerful voice! I will never return also the prices are very high for the quality of service they provide!

(Original)
No aspiraron la parte de atras de mi carro,antes de llevarlo  levante el  car seat  para q lo hicieran y ni asi ! Hable x telefono con una Stephanie que no mas me dijo que necesitaba el recibo y le dije el recibo se lo quedan ellos cuando te entregan el carro , y dijo pues venga y hable con un manager , la persona fue bien ruda sin nada de customer service y con una voz prepotente ! Jamas regresare ademas los precios son muy altos para la calidad de servicio que brindan !<//Text>

The most petty managers and employees work there. They want to charge $3 for a side of mayonnaise. The mayonnaise packets are a different brand of mayonnaise and taste different.

At a different time someone was asking for water but they were too petty to fill the container. I bought that person a $2 bottle of water.

On another day I asked for cucumbers on my sandwich. They wanted to charge me for a 1/2 a salad.

This used to be a nice place to go. I  started going there almost 40 years ago and loved it!. But now it's a miserable and horrible place to go. 😭

STAY  AWAY  until there's new management/owner maybe another 40 years or so. 🥺< /text>

I've gone to this togos for many years and typically all is good,   but today's visit was a little un- nerving.  2 out of 3 employees  were wearing  face mask, while the 3rd was not wearing a mask yet was taking orders over the phone continuously standing  over all the food.  I will not be returning to this togos eatery.    You think these restaurants would take things more seriously.</review>

I showed them the online order receipt and they acted like they didn't know what to do, and didn't care. We had already paid for our sandwiches, and they acted like they didn't care. One of the employees wore a mask, but it only covered his mouth, masks are supposed to cover your mouth and your nose. Very poor service overall.<//Text>< Pics>

Togos has a wide variety of sandwiches. I am a big fan of their turkey and avocado sandwich. Togo's has modified their menu over the years and I think it is pretty current with today's trends.  The people at the counter were nice and very efficient. The restaurant was clean and well cared for. Our party of four enjoyed our lunch.<//review>

Good service and  sandwiches, but a small place with a small seating area, that needs some maintenance on the seats.
I like the people who serve you and will go back again, mainly for take out.< /Review>

Typical delicious Togos, I love their meatball sandwiches even if it's a little bit of a crap shoot if you get really fresh ones.  This specific Togos has above average service and a patio where you can sit outside in nice weather.<//Review>

< Review>
Review is based entirely off food.

I rate this place five stars based solely on my food experience. This place is similar to all the fish fry places you’ll find anywhere in the area. Nothing special here. However the food is consistently delicious. I’ve never had a bad experience throughout all my visits and I continue to enjoy my occasional lunch. Fish is crunchy yet moist and flaky. I really enjoy the potato salad even though it’s just a store bought potato salad. Again, nothing special about this place but consistently delicious.</Review>

<Review>Pass by Louisiana fried chicken over 20 times saw a white piece of paper on the window and didn't think nothing of it it was the end of the month and I know traffic gets close to the restaurant but I never thought it would be close for every me and my mom gone today who is talking about it for over two weeks we're going to get some fried fish well got there it's close A staple in the community I leave out of Gardena just to go over there to get my fried fish. So upset we wanted fried fish but the prices keep going up one month will go there in the price will be $25 for family and next thing you know it's $35 so what happen</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c2b42eb0dbf713:0x2919a71e1ff8a882< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>This is the best fish and chicken place in LA!
The apparence is a bit worn but that doesn't take away from the specular quality of their food. Fresh fish and chicken every day and great sides to choose from. My personal favorite is their Mac n cheese. Highly recommended.</review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Delicious food, good customer service, and clean premises. Always my go-to for a tasty fulfilling meal.
I really having nothing negative to say.
They could probably season the fries a bit more, but other than that you can't go wrong with this place!<//review>

<text>I came here for the fresh fish. They have a small parking area, enough for 4 cars and there is unmetered street parking as well.
The building itself is a bit dilapidated annd seating area well worn and quite frayed around the edges.

Once you get past appearances though they offer great food choices!

Fresh fish in display counter. Select and they prepare it for you.
I had a 3 piece lunch special for under $10. Whitefish and fries with a can of soda. Prepared nicely and delicious.

Sometimes the hole in the wall places still have the best deals!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<text>We got here about 20 minutes after they opened. Only two other lanes were bowling. Only one staff member on site so there was a lot of waiting around for a lane and for food. It was fun, though, once we got everything set!

They didn't clean the lanes between uses until more staff came, so best to come at 5 pm when they'll be able to sanitize the area between different parties.

Could be cleaner, there were areas that had dirty footprints on the lanes, but with the limited staff they did the best they could.

Value for money was okay for bowling these days. We'll return at a later time but before league which came in around 6 pm.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< Review>
It was nice to have bowling since it has been a long time. I know this is not something that the staff can do, but so many people who do n9t even bring mask. Sanitizer everywhere which made me felt safer.< /Review>

During COVID-19 this establishment has been diligent on cleaning and disinfecting all surfaces and bowling balls in the entire building. I will definitely be returning soon.</text>

<Review>Didn't have to wait long, lanes were ok wish there was more seating area at the lanes. And was pricey. Paying per game per person and $5 person for shoes.. Has a bar and billards and arcade for the kids  put prizes are not the best. Did an open tab for drinks but waitress only came by once and we were done playing when she finally came back. Didn't try any of the food.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
I have to say, I'm pretty impressed! I have lived in Buena Park my entire life and have driven by this bowling alley soooo many times. I never went until Thursday night with some friends.
It's a really old bowling alley. My grandparents bowled here in their younger years so you can't expect it to be fancy at all.
The rates of their prices are awesome! It's per person, per game and the price fluctuates depending on the time you go. The great part about paying per game though is that you can take your time. The place I usually go to is by the hour so you have to bowl fast. I have my own shoes bit I think my friend said the shoe rental was $5.

The bar is open and you can order food. However everything is fried so if that's not your thing, eat before lol. I'll be back !!!<//Review>

They really did great with remodeling,  I just think that is way to expensive  they charge 60 for 2 adults and 2 kids there 4 and 6 it's too much, if you go do it through gruppon .before they had there 2 hour deal. And not no more.< /Text>

I was walking, and then I stopped. I recently moved to Fullerton, so I wander. It was depressing, though. How would Mr. Lebowski feel if they took away his right to roll? Walter would be livid, I can tell you that.

It was a lonely place on this, the first day after a hellish nightmare that lasted a whole year. Let's pray that those marble looking Brunswick balls roll again, and the monkeys 🐵 get their jobs back setting up the pins. We've spent too long in the gutter.

<review>This spot has been a local spot for me. They got bowling of course, arcades, pool tables, and bar and pool table area for the adults. Restrooms are not the greatest but cleaner than other places. The employees were helpful and keep checking up on you for drinks, food, or game set up. I would recommend checking when they have specials through out the week.< /review><resp>None<//resp><pics>None</pics><rate>4< /rate><time>1578439217864</time>< username>

< review>
Just had my daughter's 15th b-day party here and couldn't be more pleased! From the get-go, the planning and event was amazing! Used their website to plan the party - it was super easy and I was so amazed at how affordable everything was. When we arrived, I was even more impressed with how the party was set up! There were tables with decorations, a personalized lighted sign with a birthday greeting, and the party associate, Vanessa, couldn't have been any nicer! She and Adriana, our server, checked on us frequently to see if we were pleased and having a good time. The manager even came by to see that we were being taken care of! The kids had a fantastic time; bowling, video games, food and fun...what more can you ask for. I was so happy with how everything turned out. My youngest daughter even asked if we can go back for her birthday. I highly recommend having your next party here. We will definitely be back. A hidden gem indeed.</review>

<Review>I needed a ball in a hurry and their pro shop (Parkins Pro Shop) had such a great ball driller. His name was John English, and his knowledge was incredible...he not only drilled my ball, he explain some corrections, in my grip, that I didn't even know about. I used it that day in my league, and won a side pot for the first time.< /Review><UserId.>102671196731238390436< /UserId.>< Response>

Old bowling alley. So if you're looking for an authentic place that's been there since the beginning of time Carter Lanes is for you. If you blink twice you'll miss it cuz it's right off the freeway. It's not bad for a $6 beer what do you expect at a bowling alley? They are there to make money off concessions that's the only way they remain in business so keep that in mind bowling is still fun who doesn't love to go bowling especially Rock and Bowl they have a great rock and roll there.<//text>

Came here for some bowling and a drink or two. It was a fun atmosphere. People in the lanes near us were nice. We were able to have a conversation with some random people. Employees could afford to put a little pep in their step. Had to ask for a lane reset 3 times when the machine racked them wrong. Not a big deal. I'm sure I'll keep coming back. The rates have gone up recently or something though, I haven't gone in at least a year but I remember it being like half what I paid this time around.</Text>

Good times great staff and drinks. Food is not bad either for a bowling alley.  Little bit out dated inside and has that old school bowling feel.  My best buddy rolled a perfect game here once. There is a lot leagues to join if your into that.</Review>

We attended my friend's daughter's b-day party last year.  It was so pleasant.  We ended up hosting our daughter's birthday party on 9-12-17.  Our waitress Destiny was super nice and very prompt with all of the food/drinks we ordered.  The Manager Jonathan was amazing.  I would say every 30 mins he would check on us to make sure everything was going good.  It was a busy night so it meant a lot that he took time out of his busy schedule to check up on us.  Not to mention most of our guest arrived very late.  The manager added some free time to our bowling.  Like I said AMAZING crew at AMF Carter Lanes.

Can't wait to refer family and friends!  Thank You Guys!!<//review>

Fun times for the family. Food is way to pricey for the amount of food given. Taste ok when you're hungry...<//Text>

My kids loved it because they paid for it. And enjoyed every minute of it. There hard work paid off. The whole family had fun the price was very good for rentals of lane and shoes the music is loud but not to the piont that you can not hear. I will take them again and this time to eat and i will try to check out the Tuesday special. Hope this helps.</Review>

Been on a bowling league there for over 11 years. They have remodeled and painted inside an out. It's to bad that they haven't put more money into fixing there bowling machine's. Always lanes breaking down, or your ball gets stuck back there, an it comes back with a nick or scratch, some times the pin setting is off to, (missing a few pins, on your first throw.) Now that they blocked off customers from eating in cafeteria, we have to wait longer for service girls to come down to take our orders. Poor girls are running ramped. (Need more, servers during big bowling leagues playing). Oh an a BIG THING never fixed entire 11 + years I've been there, they have never fixed the girls bathroom sinks. One side only drips water, other one is a little better, but not by much, which ever side your on, the soap is empty or broken, so you have to run to other side to get soap or hand towels. So yea your walking with your bowling shoes on, now bottoms are wet from drips on bathroom floor. You gotta be careful bowling after that, you can slip and fall, or it stops you from gliding when you throw the ball.... Food prices are high $, but isn't any place, movies, bowling, park attractions. Etc.....
Other wise I love my bowling league family.<//text>

< Review>
Bowling alley is way too out dated for the price.  At $6.50 a game I could go to almost any other bowling ally in Orange County and get a better deal.  The place looks like it was last updated in the 60s and is in desperate need of new equipment.  The only reason I will go back so because of Ramon in the Pro Shop, he is very knowledgeable and friendly to new bowlers.  Has great deals and can custom drill your ball to your hand.  Unless they update their facility or drastically lower the price, I will not be bowling there again.</Review>

Strategy on how to get the pins down.  Technique is key but so is jumping up and down with a spinning pin not sure if it wants to fall or not,  sure helps... not really but it's fun trying. Great way to spend time with love ones. #datenight #familyfun<//text>< pics>

Has bowling, pool, and some video games. monday through thursday are discounts on bowling. Pool is $10 per hour. My only complaint is that bar was closed earlier in the day and there was no way to even get a coke while playing a game and no snacks either although pizza, wings, drinks are advertised. I think it gets busy on the weekends. Weekdays are good time to come to beat crowds. Staff are friendly and helpful.<//Review>

Reasonable prices, friendly and prompt service, and a clean well-maintained facility.  Some of the balls have defects, but it's just a few.  Overall, it's a great place I plan on visiting again.< /review>

I went with a friend, so I don't know if it was too pricey.  It was so fun, since it was my first time bowling. I had a great time, and the drinks and food were fantastic. I'm definitely going there again soon. 🎳🎳🎳🎳🎳🎳🎳< /review>

Clean lanes, pool tables on the side and a lot of parking. They do have a cafe and bar and a designated family area on the right. Always have events going on like Summer VIP 3 games every day of summer for $55.</Review>

My, how much this place has deteriorated over the last decade. Went in for a practice session and was shocked at the condition of the house. Approaches looked like they haven't been replaced in 20 years, and the machinery was filthy to the point I had to clean my ball in session for it to maintain its effectiveness. The kicker was barely 5 minutes after completing my prepaid games, having another group come down before I could finish packing up. Disappointed would be a vast understatement.</Review>

At $12 a person per game i thought this place quite a rip off cant rent lanes by the hour anymore either. For 4 peopke thats almost 50 bucks a game. No thanks, the lanes and atmosphere look great but i aint spending money like that to bowl</Text>

Im giving it a 2 because the balls kept getting stuck.Not a Very good Variety of balls.The sizes.Also complained & was never moved or seem like the problem wasn't being fixed throughout at least the 2hours we were there.There was also an extra lane open rite next to us.We were a Party of ten with two lanes & our other half of the fam played double of wat we played because of the stuff getting stuck & having to wait for the only ball I could fine to fit.For eveybody on our side.Kept having WAIT FOR THE BALLS TO COME OUT & IT TO CLEAR.Seemed also like I got somebody's shoes that had just played.They were damp & had an Odor.But otherwise we tried to make it as fun as possible.Next time we are going somewhere else.</Review>

< Review>
Drive past almost everyday and finally decided to give it a try on date night. It also happened to be league night so there was a 45 minute wait. We played pool for a little bit in the room behind the registers which I noticed was a little drab and needed some fixing. The ceilings were peeling in some places, as were the walls, and it definitely could use some new lights. We finally got a lane, played 2 games and called it a night. I feel like the  lanes ckjkd use a little update but overall not too bad and the prices weren't too crazy either.</Review>

Without a doubt one of the worst managers that I ever dealt with in this industry. I ask for the regional manager's name and contact information and he refused to give it to me. I get he has a lot to hide but this is completely unprofessional. There are issues with this house that I would like to address and I have no response. The manager's name is John Smith.

Liked AM Carter Lanes but bad experience with front desk when l. I was sent a  $20 coupon. Bowled 4 Games and 1 pair of shoes. 4.49 per game X 4 $17.96 plus 1 pair of shoes Minus the coupon I should have been charged  $ 2.25 I was charged $17.96 and Only discounted $5.00 on a $20 coupon. Very poor business practice and I just signed up for online member ship that morning. The attendant was argument I've and Also charged me a game when My nephew has a Summer pass . I was shocked the The Company sends me an online coupon abd the attendant made up his on rules. Really enjoyed the Bowling alley the lines but he ruined the good experience we had up until that point. This is The AM ON A LEMON STRESS IN ANAHEIM< /text>

the place is not classy.  Overall clean but a bit dated.  Great deals for bowling on fridays after 5.  The food was surprisingly good for a bowlung alley.  They could use more waiters - there was only one lady helping all lanes-  i will go back.<//Text>
