<Review>Great napa store, largest one in the area. They have lots of stuff in stock that most others don't carry. Friendly knowledgeable staff. It's the only parts store I'll use when I'm in the area so yes I absolutely recommend these folks.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< name>

This particular Napa went from being the best place to being the worst. They have literally not honored their battery warranties, won't accept batteries for core charges even though they say they will, and just straight up are unethical, and unhelpful now. It's sad.<//Text>

Went to pick up a part that napaonline showed in stock at this store.  When I arrived, the salesman said they had 2 in stock.  He went back to get the part and came back and said they didn't have any in the back when he looked.  Wasted my time driving all the way out here today.  Frustrating!< /text>

<Time>1552967357520<//Time><rate>1< /rate><text>Sadly a really good customer service turned horrible
Larry did a great job finding something for me and had it shuttled over same day.
He did not know the policy that I was supposed to pay for it first.
After several calls the item was not in when it was supposed to arrive
Cody answered each time and could not locate it. He explained that it was supposed to be paid for and it would not be arriving.
I was not pleaded  since I wanted 3 hours to pick it up and could have gotten it by that time somewhere else. I asked for a manger so I could get it shuttled over asap.
The biggest jerk ever Manager Wes located the item and blamed me for being upset and wanted me to explain why I was being rude. I explained that Cody told me it was not possible to get my item without paying and I needed it that night. Wes was so condescending and self righteous. He has no understanding that a customer who is told an item is arriving and then is told it is not going to be delivered might be a little stressed and upset.
Wes needs training as a manager. Customers will be upset and a good manager defuses rather than argue with a customer about the internal policies. How was I supposed to know I was supposed to pay first? If I was told I would have gladly done so.
All Wes had to do is state that Cody was correct that the policy was to pay first but it was still shuttled over. He could have been better and understood the error was on their side.
I was able to scramble and find my item at another store.
Never giving my money or business to this store.
To Larry's defence he asked the procedure to another co-worker when he was getting my item set up for transfer. I could hear him asking. Possibly Wes.
Thank you Larry for efforts.</text>< Pics>

Anyway, I just needed a battery and Declan was very helpful and provided solid advice of things to consider when replacing it. I purposely went there to get an Optima Red Top for my Outback that loves to consume batteries like french fries. Once again, great service by mechanically-experienced staff.

<Review>I was looking for a headlight. After standing and looking for over 5 minutes I had 2 employees walk right past me and not say a word or ask if I needed help. I then approached the front desk where 3 employees were "helping" one customer and 3 others were doing who knows what on their computers. Once they were done with customer they all admired some amazing picture on another employee's Instagram account on their phone.
I'm going to order off of Amazon, and won't be back at this store.< /Review>< Rating>

<Text>Never had problems until today. I walked in to receive some pricing on a battery. Lady was blunt and to the point, made no apologies for being so absolute. It was bordeline rude and disrespectful. I walked out and walked back in to purchase some additional products. I noticed she was helping another gentlemen, the service he received was 100% better than what I received. Dont know what the issue was. Just disapointed.< /Text>< pics>

Everything they sell here is double the price. The staff is not bad but not as helpful as autozone. If autozone doesn't have the part and you can't wait for it to come in online, go here.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Maybe I picked the wrong day to make it my first visit.   Walked into a lady screaming at other employees.  Most of them with shock and disbelief on their faces.   I am glad she disapeared and some one else helped me.   I won't return soon< /Review>

<Review>Ive enjoyed magic wok for years.  I loved it when it was located on lincoln back in the day and now on mckinley.  They are generous with the quantity of food they guve.  The prices are not too high.  Cant say anything bad about this spot.  Love the coupons in the mail.  Keep it up.< /Review><date>1559548717434<//date>< user_name>

Came back for a different dish and the same tough and chewy.
Also, no condiments, and they charge for Chile.

Not worth the money or disappointment!< /review>< Pictures>

My family and I eat here regularly.  The food is always good and retated regularly.  If for any reason you want the food made fresh just ask.</Review>

<rating>1</rating><review>My boyfriend and I were craving Chinese so we came to this Magic Work and I noticed that the tables weren't wiped down and there was old food just sitting on the tables and on the ground. I dismissed it as perhaps the people had just left and the workers hadn't gotten to it yet (which was still weird considering the whole place was empty except for us). We got our food and took it home and ate and I instantly felt something wrong with my stomach and I got sick and my boyfriend did as well a few hours later. We won't be back. The Grade said "A" but maybe they need to send another health inspector through.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>Chicken was hard, visited right before dinner time, old food, portions have gotten smaller (smaller box, and they pad the meat section with noodles and more rice), I know this place has been here for years, but come on , its Chinese food,  it's cheap to make, you have one employee in the front and one in the back, going to Golden Chopsticks from now on.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I scheduled an appointment that I told the scheduler would be for a compressor replacement on my LG refrigerator, Conner’s being the LG authorized service rep.  The appointment was two weeks out. I had already trouble shot the refrigerator with the service manuel, and knew it was a bad compressor. So I ordered a new compressor and dryer directly from LG. Connor’s called the day before the appointment to confirm and I reminded them that it was to replace the compressor and that I had already acquired one from LG.  They proceeded to tell me that it was against their policy to install parts that they did not supply.  I mentioned that they were OEM purchased directly from LG still in the box. The caller checked with the manager and informed me that they would not install parts purchased by me, and asked if Wanted to cancel the service call.  Fortunately I was able to find a repair shop out of Fowler that was willing to charge me just a little bit more to travel to Visalia and install my parts.  Needless to say I am less than satisfied with the service that was offered by an LG authorized service company.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

We looked into the details of your service call and it does appear that there was miscommunication that led to our representative telling you that we couldn’t install the parts you purchased. Normally, it is our policy to not install any parts that we didn’t purchase ourselves as many parts sold directly to consumers online are non-OEM and are made poorly causing them to fail more quickly. In this case though, since the compressor was and dryer were provided directly from the manufacturer, we should have installed them for you. We apologize for the confusion and inconvenience, and we would be happy to discuss any concerns you have regarding your service with us. Please feel free to give us a call at 866-316-3002, and have a great rest of your day.'}< /resp>

This company by far has given our household the best experience, we used previous companies in the past that have been a mess; so bad, that it is hard to trust just any appliance repair company. They were a little more pricey than the local competitors but when you want the best, you pay the best and every penny was well deserved. Thank you Connors appliance, we will definitely recommend you to all of our friends and family.</Text>

This is the 2nd time I've need some repairs.  One for my freezer and then for my dishwasher.  Jeremy came out on both repairs.  Both times he did a great job.  Told me what the problem was and the cost of the repair.  The part had to be ordered he called the day it arrived and came out to install it.  Couldn't ask for a better, nicer and professional person than Jeremy.  GREAT JOB.< /review>

I called Conner's appliance repair for an estimate. They are way too over priced. They charge $79 just to come look at your machine. I called 559 appliance repair instead. Their estimates are FREE. The guy came out looked at my washer and had it fixed in 20 min. He did an amazing job and I haven't had any problems since.<//review>

I called Mr. Appliance of the Central Valley and they scheduled a technician to come out within a few hours of me calling. Jeremy showed up and in a few minutes diagnosed and fixed my refrigerator. Problem solved. Fridge saved. Thanks Mr. Appliance of the Central Valley!</Text>

<Text>We bought the most expensive washer and dryer (separate units) on the market at Home Depot with both having separate top and bottom loaded compartments, steam washing/drying, wifi-control, etc. All the bells and whistles, about $3.5k for both. The washer stopped working, not something I'd expect for the price point after less than a year of owning. We lost the receipt so can't have it covered under warranty, lesson learned... I expected a VERY high repair bill IF it even could be fixed. Conner's diagnosed the problem to be a circuit board that can't be ordered by anyone who isn't explicitly associated with the manufacturer and I thought, "oh great, we're gunna pay probably hundreds for an analysis and still be stuck with a broken washer..." To my VERY appreciative surprise, Conner's charged nothing for the diagnosis. That's a stand-up business and if anything else ever breaks in my home (first-time home buyer here) that they can work on I'll be glad to call them first and give them my money because I definitely feel like I can trust that they won't overcharge, upsell, or otherwise take advantage of us. If anything I feel like we took advantage of them for providing the service, time, gas, et cetera at no charge. I don't often review businesses but if I do they're usually for extremely bad or good experiences. Conner's definitely earned their 5 star review today.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x8094c3934932fb31:0xccf3bcfce9272bdd<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Mr. Appliance is the perfect example of the type of service you HOPE to receive when making this type of call. I had someone out to look at our washing maching, assuming we'd be spending upwards of $250 to fix the issue (a loud rattling noise). The gentleman who came out was super friendly, knowledgeable, and took his time researching the issue. Ultimately he explained that, while it was annoying, the vibration causing the sound was not causing any harm to the washer. And while he could order parts to fix it, the cost would be high, and it wasn't necessary if we could deal with the noise (which we can, since the washer is in our garage). He then took the time to share ways we can easily extend the life of our washer, to get several more years out of it before needing to purchase a new unit.

Ultimately, we ended up HAPPILY paying the $75 consultation fee, and I've since recommended Mr. Appliance to a ton of people. The service we received proves this company understands that being honest and trustworthy will result in a lot more business than taking advantage of customers who aren't very knowledgeable in the product they're seeking help with. It's never a good day with a large household appliance breaks down, but I am thrilled to know we can call on Mr. Appliance when it inevitably happens.<//Text>

<review>Edit 7/23/21: I used to think they were great, but that's no longer the case. They have not only taken much longer to get their orders out, but they don't pay attention to cooking times. I placed an order through doordash for a single basket of chicken tenders, and the dasher was forced to wait for nearly an hour at the restaurant before getting the order because they didn't bother to cook it. On top of that, the chicken was RAW! If my wife didn't habitually tear her tenders in half, she wouldn't even have noticed before biting into raw chicken. This is dangerous and unsafe.

If you've never had a problem with them, keep ordering. Maybe they pay more attention to cooking pizza than their other menu items. But I can't trust them anymore.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGHoAAsRe6gjCqesZj-SONH4Uq2BoRvlcOO-kl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqZx2PFXdWKv8ZO_OioPl_2wy8FmEbgUwjpXp-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNU1Fuz8nqHGJFLmsbGjVxb7TLPsf2kf4AhKSx0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Gmap_id>

<text>We tried this place for the first time after living in Santee for over 5 years and we are glad we did. We ordered the 16 slices not realizing it was going to be ginormous! (The name should’ve given it away, lol) We got the meat lovers to give it a try and we enjoyed it. We are a family of 5, but I think it would feed us for the next 3 days. It really was a lot of pizza 🍕 Enjoy!</text>< time>

First time I've heard of this place, but I appreciate Google's advice. I was in search for pizza as the kids did not want anything else and didn't want to go for a quick and easy (hot and ready) pizza. I've had all the Giant NY pizzas around here and this was is very good. Really generous on the toppings and very friendly. The kids really enjoyed the pizza as well. I'll definitely try the other items in the future.<//text>

Reminds me of one of my favorite pizza spots back East for the good dough and clean taste in the dough. Many people’s dough out west has a chlorine or two water after taste. Not here at all

Also very nice and good prices and speed< /text>

Really delicious pizza. I’m new in town and not familiar with other local spots, but their pizza was so amazing the first time that I’m going to have at least a third time. The crust is tasty and the ingredients are fresh. They’re also really accommodating and nice! We used Uber to deliver to minimize outdoor activity. Great experience!< /text>

Tried to call to order based on the photos here. I tried to order the 2 2-topping xl for 22.99 as the flier says. I was told that they could only give me 2 1 topping pizzas for $28. Feels like bait and switch, no thanks.<//review>

<text>The owner was so friendly and made us feel welcome. The restaurant is extremely clean and decorated so nicely. We ordered the spinach and pesto pizza and it was absolutely divine! I also enjoyed my antipasto salad. We will be going back!</text>< pictures>

Ordered the bbq chicken Hawaiian pizza. Man the crust was tough chewy as a big laffy taffy candy. Not sure if they skipping on the ingredients on thier dough or Uber Eats waited to long to pick it up. Either way this was the last time I order food from here. I ended up giving the rest of the food to my dogs.</Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>I went Saturday night about 8. Ordered 2 slices with pepperoni. I asked how big the slices were. He showed me using his hands. I waited about 15-20 minutes. The box he handed me was light so I opened it. It had 2 slices in it. It was like he took 1 slice and cut it in 2 pieces. It was like $8 and each slice was less than 2” at widest point.
It tasted good but it was the most expensive pizza I’ve had. I probably won’t go back. I feel ripped off.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<rate>4</rate><Review>2nd time we have ordered! As a former server at Sanfilippos La Mesa Blvd. I have high expectations.  Bronx pizza isnt cheap however products are good. They dont skimp. What I can say is that I received 3 notifications that my order was adjusted yet all I saw was price increases. Takes a good hour for the pizza delivery which I'm fine with so long as my pie is cooked and correct. Four  today's order quite foughy . I asked for well done and pie was cold in middle. Spent 70 bucks for an 18 inch pie a med antipasto salad missing a paid for extra dressing and garlic cheese bread. Over all I think this place is pretty good. I'm a tough cookie. I want what I pay for and at 70$ plus 20%tip I do expect perfectly cooked pizza and any extras I paid for. Still beats Fillippis in Santee hands down.</Review>< Pics>

The slices are enormous, the crust is proper east coast style and delicious, and the owner is super friendly. So happy that we finally have a real, non-chain pizza slice place in Santee! We look forward to coming back many more times, I highly recommend you give it a try too!</review>

I ordered online at 7:09, the estimate was that it should be ready between 7:25-7:35, when I got there at 7:30 they told me it should be right out.

Obviously you were lying to my face & think my time is worthless since that that point the (thinish crust) pizza couldn't have even been in the oven since it wasn't ready until 7:58.

I was literally on my phone trying to cancel the order when you brought it out. Try respecting your customers, then maybe it'll at least matter if you're food's any good or not (which it was just ok).<//Text>

<text>Ehh. The park could be better maintained. Dry grass and trash everywhere and the beaches where the skate park is has all kinds of inappropriate drawing and writing. This park lacks maintenance.< /text>< Rate>

<review>We discovered Joan’s Pumpkin Farm really last minute and this little place was packed with an amazing time! There were many things for little ones to do and be entertained with. Every single worker we met with was so kind and made our experience there such a memorable one for all our family. I can’t wait to go again next year and make it a family tradition :)</review><Time>1609528464772</Time></record></dataset><record>
<Rating>2</Rating><GmapID>0x808fddd7b00c8567:0x4e4b26cc01248f86<//GmapID><Text>We drove thirty miles to this pumpkin patch because it had one of the best reviews in the area. The farm was spacious which is great during a pandemic and you can take some great photos because of the scenery. However, it doesn't make up for the lack of diverse pumpkins (size and color), the underwhelming maze, and the use of Native American culture as props. We ended up leaving within an hour and went to a small, local pumpkin patch which we were happier with. Overall, it's nice but not worth the drive for me.<//Text>< Response>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>In the month of October we always bring a visit to Joan’s farm. This 11/12 months of the year cattle ranch turns pumpkin patch in the month of Halloween.
There is plenty of space for a lit of activities for the kids. The pumpkins are plentiful and beautiful.
Here is where kids can learn about how vegetables grow and cattle is herded.

Go check it out!< /Review>< Pictures>

This is the best pumpkin patch in the area. There's lots for kids to do including a petting zoo, hay ride, play area and usually a bouncy house or two. There's also lots of shade providing relief on hot October days.< /Text>

We have visited every year for 9 years & this farm never disappoints!  Staff is so friendly & the selection of pumpkins is great.  Plenty of fun stuff for the kids at a reasonable price.

Do yourself a favor and don't miss this Pumpkin Patch🎃< /review></record>

We had a sunny breezy weekday for this excursion and enjoyed our visit. 2 large pumpkins were $25 total and should have been $32 according to the price list. Looks like the place has seen better days. Everything looks a little run down. Very dusty. The animals did not look very healthy. But there were pumpkins - lots is them - and many happy kids running around. Concession people were grumpy. Parking and port a potties were a long walk from anywhere. Like I said, all the children visiting appeared to be having a great time which is the whole point!</Text>

So cute, a great place to bring children. So much environment, for a little, or a lot. It's as cheap as you make it. I kick em a couple bucks so they dont struggle. But kids petting livestock and getting to see other kids is great.<//text>

We visit every Halloween season. There is a great selection of pumpkins, big and small. The staff here is friendly and fun. Lots of activities for the kids, including a petting zoo. It can get a bit crowded with preschool field trips, and it's a little off the beaten trail. It's worth the drive out there, though.< /Text>

This place is a cool place to take the kids. Its only big down fall is that they dont have a place to wash your hands after you use the porta potty there and that they where kinda dirty.< /Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>Looks like I'm not the first one to have online ordering and customer service issues with this company.

I placed an order for some xener diodes on 8/23/17 and have not received anything. I called during their listed business hours and ended up leaving messages because no one would answer. Multiple inquiries were sent online, and I got one response back saying that they would check on it.....I have not received any sort of response back.

If you plan to order online with this company and haven't before, I would highly advise against it.< /Review>< pictures>

I accidentally found this place I live in Hayward and my mom had a dentist appointment half a block from here and I took a walk with my 6 year old and saw this place I’m being honest at that moment I’m like, I’ll risk it because I really wanted a hair cut I just couldn’t find the place and OMG it’s been over a year now and I still go here and I’m actually making an appointment today highly recommended and they’re so good and super fast... and I don’t trust just any salon to cut or dye my hair..</text>

I don’t know why other people like this place, I felt disrespected and not listened to. The haircut she gave me was awful and I will have to have it fixed elsewhere. Wouldn’t recommend this business to anyone.< /Text>

Nice place and decent pricing. A bit busy on Sundays, but most of the time you would wait for 10-20 minutes.<//review>

<text>I highly recommend this place for hair cut. Especially Kayla, she did what I exactly wanted and I feel Awesome. I asked her to trim my hair I thought it will reduce my length, but she cut exactly how much I asked her to.
Thankyou Kayla, I love it😀</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>I go here for haircuts. Chau, the owner, is great. They always do a fantastic job on my haircut. Some days are very busy, so many call ahead, and they're great on their times. Great people to chat to, and you hear them know their customers on a first name bases.<//review><resp>None</resp><user_id>116046037012502620028</user_id><user_name>Jayson Jackson</user_name>< Pictures>

I present Chao, the owner,  with a picture of how I wanted my hair look like after the cut.   She spent only about 15 minutes to cut my hair and charged me $20 (only include hair cut and blow dry).  Shampoo will be another $15 more.  I am upset and disappointed not only with the price, but it does not look like the picture that I showed to her before the hair cut start.  She did not follow the picture to cut my hair and she wanted to charge me more if I wanted her to make any changes.
FINAL WORD:  IF YOU WANTED YOUR HAIR LOOKED LIKE THE WAY YOU WANT, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE and do not go there.  OTHERWISE, YOU WILL BE UPSET AND DISAPPOINTED LIKE ME.  NOT WORTH IT.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Worst hair cut ever! I have thick hair with lots of body and she only spent 5 minutes cutting it and butchered it. She didn't even part my hair down the middle or thoroughly brush my hair or even wet it! Don't go here if you are a woman! Worst hair cut ever!</text>

<rate>5</rate><text>We weren’t super hungry but wanted a quick bite so we purchased the hummus plate appetizer and the boneless chicken kabob. Good thing we didn’t get two kabob orders because the chicken kabobs came with so much food! It was delicious. The meat was very tender and quite fresh.  I love the bold color from the saffron in the dish. Would recommend this neat eatery with rugs on the wall and blue velvet couches which make it extra cozy and warm.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3v1hDMZJPvnW9TPapOlatCOCIiEq-KqNmi4_A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7cvOBlzZ8SGG8Jpu2xQmrAxy5_eC5OjG5ySQJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOw_pnG_E0XrOChgEuddSKlzSh0ZCys1f6c_NcJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9BsOLGDhXE1JwQ94fx-AO0jsINvmja64HFQoD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

<text>Absolutely Delicious! The Beef (filet mignon) kebabs I can't stop thinking about. Tender, lean, aromatic. The rice was melt in your mouth perfect and the grilled veggies so flavorful. Try the lentil soup. Very generous portions on everything we ordered. A plus that they are quick off/quick on the 101 fwy.</text><name>Michael A<//name>< pictures>

Persian food at this place - delicious. Excellent spot to spend time alone or talk business. Had a friend come into town and she asked me to take her here again. This place has a nice atmosphere. I can see why they have so many good reviews.< /review>

They have beautiful decor inside it’s got kind of a romantic feel to it. The service was really good they were very nice and attentive. The food however...not the best. The koobideh tastes a little off and the chicken kabob wasn’t very flavorful.</text>

Charming little Persian restaurant with food and service all A+ quality. The tadik was a little too crunchy for my liking and the joojeh kabob wasn’t served traditional and wasn’t cut into pieces and was kind of one large chunk that was orange but the koobideh kabob and fesenjoon was worth going for again.</Review>

The food here was absolutely delicious. I was craving Persian food for the longest and Kaban Persian Restaurant was in the area where I was so I read the reviews and couldn’t resist to try them out. All I can say it I will come back. Great service as well.</Text>

Update: Four visits, four excellent dinners. Great kebabs, hummus, and shirazi salad. But they've added a beautiful version of Fesenjian and some other of the more complex Persian dishes. The Fesenjian, chicken in a crushed walnut, pomegranate sauce, was intense, sweet and tangy.
Attentive, personal service from the owner. He cares about his food. The price is quite moderate for the consistent high quality.< /Review>

I often come to this location, but I wanted to commend them on all the things they are doing to keep customers safe during the pandemic. Julisa helped me today and you can tell that she was trained well. I ordered a smoothie and one of their bowls. She took care to not contaminate both items. Washing utensils in between. And everything tasted fresh and yummy.</Text>

I waited for a little over 30mins just to get my 3 drinks and only for them not to taste right! It was so irritating especially  since it was a mobile order! And I checked in at the front when I walked in is my mobile order ready? They said no. So I approached the girls 25 mins after I walked in and they said “we gave that order already”. Will I’ve been here for more than 20mins n you have not called my mobile order. And all I get was sorry we’ll make it now. I Will not be back to this shop again! Disappointed and irritated with this shop!</Text>

I love Jamba juice in general, however this particular store struggles with its customer service. The several times I have been there have always resulted in for line rude girls that don't care about their jobs.<//Text>

The service started out great. However, when another customer pointed out that the staff's ponytail was getting on the fruits she just looked at the other customer and ignored her. She didn't acknowledge the other customers comment or try to fix her hair. She just whipped her hair around and continued fixing drinks. Yummy right< /review>

<Text>Fast but messy . Order a large order of drinks from them one day. I knew there was some of the product on the lids when I got them. But when I took them out of my car, the front passenger seat was covered in jamba juice. It didn't spill, but all the the stuff that was on the lid got all over the place. And the ones on the front floor were ok because they were in a box.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1563796789140, 'text': 'Thanks for the feedback, Rj Huie.

Edit: within 3 days of posting this review I was contacted by Jamba Juice.  They apologized for the experience and asked me to go onto their customer survey page and give the details of the events above.  I did, they reviewed the stores video of the date & time I gave them. They then called me back, apologized again and in so many words said this is not the way it's done & that they will be dealing with the management to fix the problems. They are also sending me 2 smoothies.</review><resp>{'time': 1530802701873, 'text': 'Andrew Bitners we are sorry to hear about this and appreciate feedback.

Bad quality - orange juice I got from this place tasted like lemonade.
I came back to ask if there was a mistake - but no, as per the workers "oranges are not in season" (November).
Service was not friendly at all.< /text>

Definitely always great food!!! Our favorite family spots when we come out to Oceanside! It's the most requested spot from our kiddos! Who can complain when the kids can enjoy their food while the parents can enjoy a nice cold beer 😉!Their food is delicious! From the all day breakfast or a good bacon avocado burger 😍.Great portions too!! Their menu is so good you can order a different meal with every visit lol. Their service  is AWESOME!! Definitely a favorite 💙</Text>

Great food for anytime of day.
The breakfast is awesome and I personally like the biscuits and gravy with half bacon and half sausage. The French toast and breakfast burritos are good as well, be careful with their hot sauce. The coffee is usually not burnt as well.

The French fries are made perfectly and is only outdone by the onion rings which are the best especially when compared to a restaurant or bar, be sure to ask for ranch with it.

The smoothies are awesome and can compete with Jamba juice so get the mango smoothie.

There are also beers on tap. Plenty of IPAs for me which makes any meal here feel like a restaurant, sculpin and stone stand out for me.

Mask are enforced which makes me happy, so be sure to bring one.

The drive through was made for a compact vehicle so be sure to take the turn slowly when getting your food.

I'm giving this place a 3 because it was very clean, very social distanced, and the french fries were good. But the burger and drink-- I'm still trying to get that awful taste out of my mouth!!!! Do not recommend.< /text>

Customer service is excellent! But don't order any burritos, they come with iceberg lettuce which equals watery burritos. In any case who puts iceberg in burritos?< /Text>

Angelos has great food.  Only thing that sux is the portions have gotten way smaller for the price.  The price was worth it for the big portions.  Beef up your portions back and we will be back all the time.</Text>

<text>Their menue has a WIDE variety of really, GOOD food. Comparable to deny's prices but better quality and plenty of it. Good drive through service. You can sometimes spot the owner helping out around the place.
They serve breakfast all day, burgers, tacos, steak, gyros, acai bowls, ect... Like I said WIDE variety on the menu.
Also, nice variety of different drinks.  Including surprisingly good coffee, and other specialty drinks! I recently ordered an Americano, tasted really smooth, and with a good strong flavor!</text><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80dc6e35c448f34b:0x88acab4dd60a70d2<//GmapID><name>Brianna Parton<//name><user>114850997714945941405</user>< Rate>

<Text>French toast is amazing my only wish would be for the girl at the window would be more polite & friendly she did not greet us with a smile and now that I'm thinking of it she did not greet us whatsoever not even a simple smile. And then she hands me my order and that's it, she didnt say have a nice day or thank you i actually thought we had another bag of food coming so i stayed at the window

<Review>Food was good and the wait time was good. My disappointment was the amount of french fries and onion rings that were served. I remember back in the days they would serve you in a big container when ordering onion rings now it's in a small bowl. Same thing with fresh fries. Carne asada quesadilla wasn't all that great. Meet was supper dry and veggi toppings were definitely sitting out for a long period of time. I understand times are changing but that's what made this restaurant different, was the of fries, onion rings, etc they would serve! I paid almost 30$ for a Monster burger, carne asada quesadilla and a side of onion rings. I honestly don't think I will be coming back. Their customer service was good.<//Review>< Name>

Food is great and in big portions.  Have been coming here for years. Luv their grilled chicken 🥪 sandwich..maybe because the pickles add a bit of salty, sour  taste. Their Gyros are huge and sooo good. Definitely recommend this place.<//text>

It wasn't the worst burger I've had, but it was not the best either. The Service was mediocre, the price was a bit on the high side, and the burgers were like hockey pucks.</text>

We would go there for breakfast on Fridays. Nice place to eat, relax and enjoy the surroundings.  Not at all far from the beach or anything else you may need. The owner always treated us well & even brought us extra food just because we were there so long.<//Review>

Tried ordering through drive thru for the first time to see what all the fuss way about but when ordering the person couldn't get drink orders and when correcting order at the window person at the window was rude asking to order correctly at speaker before arriving to window. Asked to make drinks larger and she made it clear it was going to be a different price (which we knew). Decided it wasn't worth all the hassle and went to in n out instead and had better food and better customer service.<//review>

< Review>
The restaurant had a huge selection to choose from.  The food was pretty good a little bit greasy but it is a burger/ breakfast/ Mexican place. The service was quick other than the confusion from the guy in front of us. This place has got the best after partying food near the hotel by far. There seemed to be a steady flow of customers in the drive thru.  I would try it again< /Review>

Although pricey like everything in Cali, you actually get your money worth. Large portions. Great chat meal is you are into that or good meal period of you not on the health tip. They do have salads and I did not try one. Everything that came off the grill appears better than the pictures presented. Unfortunately I did have a rather long wait while walking in to order compared to drive thru. It seemed as though they were more focused on that than those inside. Part of the new norm with Covid I assume.< /review>< gmapID>

As busy as it is, they have it together pretty well. They keep cool under pressure and thats how you can tell that the service is genuine. The reason why I gave four stars instead of five was for cleanliness, they could use more frequent cleaning of the dining room, such as designating an employee to pick up the empty beer glasses every 15 minutes if you know what I mean.< /text>

I got breakfast burritos. 3 of them fed my 3 kids, myself, and my husband. They are quite large, but the price does reflect that as well. The line moved extremely slow, and the cashier at the window wanted to send us off without our full order and tried to argue about it. Handed the receipt to show we did have other items, and she finally gave them to us. But did not give back our receipt. Food tasted great, customer service is a bit lacking. Not sure if I will be back.<//Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>I stopped here for a Gyro sandwich combo on Saturday, June 7, 2020. I paid $13.53 for the worst meal I have ever had. The Gyro was dry and I couldn't even chew it. The fries were hard as rocks and cold. Plus with only one person in front of me in the drive through I waited over 25 minutes for my food. Talk about throwing money away. If you want good food at Angelo's go to the one in Carlsbad. This one is not run properly!!!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Pleasant surprise, should've been coming to this place a long time ago. Only went to drive-thru, but looked clean from the outside. Outstanding burger (1/2 lb double cheese) A+; fries were baked so B; vanilla milkshake was on point so A. Will go again. Highly recommend.< /review>

First off drive thru cashier didn’t even tell me my total. Secondly she couldn’t even count the cash correctly and literally over charged me which a cashier anywhere should know how to count correctly. Lastly my zucchini fries were 100% burnt and inedible which is ridiculous. Never come to this location unless you want to waste money and get nothing in return!<//Review>

The food and service here is phenomenal. They serve my favorite burger San Diego North County and they are my top choice for a milkshake in all of Southern California. The menu is a bit all over the place. Regardless, everything is very satisfying. The staff is incredibly accommodating. Specifically, I recently arrived less than five minutes from their closing time because it was erroneously listed online, and the staff treated me with kindness when they could have turned me away. In case my recommended hours change has not taken effect; Sunday-Thursday closing time is 11pm.</review>

Ordered half pound combo Burger. The meat was 2 patties overcooked. French fries was excellent but way too many. Very pricey. $$$ Hamburger should have been one thick large Patty. 👎<//Text>

I have a Chevy Silerado that doesn't do sharp turns and the median in between the speaker and the window is super tight. Had to pass the window and back up to get my food. Took near 10 minutes to get the sandwich. That, though was so good. Breakfast sandwich was super tasty. The quality if the food at all Angelo's locations are top notch. It was huge too. Worth the price for sure. Yum.</Review>< pics>

Best fried zucchini I've ever had. However - the dining room and bathroom were filthy. The service was limited to calling your order number out when your food is ready.< /Review>

Walked in from beach cottage and ordered two breakfast burritos, sausage and ham, and an order of pancakes, Wow, lots of food... Picked up some peppers at the counter and a cup of coffee, and back to the cottage. Was really surprised at the amount of food and how good the burritos were, we had the other halves the next day. Pancakes good also... Friendly service and quality and quantity were appreciated. We will be back.. Pooch loved em also...Thanks...< /Review>

<text>Food is great. Portions are huge. Inside appearance looks and feels dirty (not clean). Bathrooms are locked from non-customers so I was surprised when I walked in and they were disgusting. The bathrooms were filthy and smelly. Graffiti all over the walls and I felt gross after being in there. If they clean it up I’ll delete this review but I can’t recommend a place that feels dirty to be in.< /text>< rating>

Yes the food is good.  HOWEVER....I WAS charged $413.00 for a Gyro combo meal that was only $13.00.  As soon as I found out, I went to clear it up and the the worker who took my card disappeared.  I waited for a manager to come from another location only to have him say, we will refund your card...No, thank you, I'll wait to clear it up now.   I'll take cash.  I waited and it was eventually cleared, but you can't make those kind of mistakes....< /review>

Menu is huge! People working were friendly and got my order correct. The burgers were huge, even the kids meal one. I would say they are the middle ground between in n out and five guys. In quality, value and price. Which to me is a good thing. I would definitely go back to try more things on the menu.< /text>

I go to this place when I'm in town. They have Variety of options to choose from. This last time when I went I ordered the breakfast sandwich with ham. Was good till the last bite which had a hair in it. I dont know if they use hair nets but I would recommend that to prevent hairs in the food.</review>

<review>First time experience.. I ordered a 1/4 lb cheeseburger combo. Apparently they have a deal that you get a free burger with a combo purchase, however it's only if requested (as written in tiny joke of letters on their banner). I missed out but not bitter as you'll see why. Burger was mediocre. It's like a frozen patty with minimal seasoning and the bread is large, making for an impressive size, but the sauce was thin and I don't need or want a 1/4 head of lettuce in my burger). Fries are beyond plentiful which is nice, but I was given four packets of ketchup for about a pound of fries (which didn't have enough salt and I normally don't like my fries salty).</review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>Best place to customize your meal because of all of the ingredients. Excellent portions; each meal fills me up, and I believe I have always left with leftovers. The last item that I ordered was the lamb and beef gyro combo. I didn't even know they sold zucchini fries.< /review>< Rating>

<review>I'm giving this place one-star because zero stars is not an option. The food was so greasy, way too overpriced, and the service was ridiculous. I think I've been to a different location and it was a little bit better but this specific location was very unpleasant.

Great food, fast service, fanominal staff, and cheap prices. If you ever find yourself in Oceanside you have to stop by this place. I know you can't see it, but there's a 2lb hash brown underneath everything 😁😁😁.</Review>

They still use the same care as when the family opened the first restaurant and the tradition continues today.
Generous portions, lots of variety on the menu and made fresh to order.

Looked at everyone else’s plates and they were filled with food. So 2 adults and a 10yr old shared a chicken tenders platter with drink...only $11 and it was enough for all 3 of us. This picture was taken after we already ate some. Staff was friendly as well. Fries were greasy but delicious!! Everything made fresh!< /text>< pics>

<text>I love this place especially for breakfast. But they also serve for the world's best hamburger with fries.

Surprisingly my only complaint is that there is too much food served :-) that is only makes you fatter than you already are :-)

Seriously this is a great family restaurant and your kids will love it.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I went to a Hilo’s this morning about 10:30 a.m. and I asked for the 101 with all bacon and I asked for bacon and egg meal that large Mexican woman at the cash register gave me the 101 as I asked then instead of bacon and eggs meal I got steak and eggs and got charged for it and the steak was over cooked anyway but these cashiers need to speak better English and pay more attention and repeat back the order I was very disappointed in my meal that I didn’t ask for won’t be going there anymore!</Review>

This place is iconic, they have several locations in Oceanside and have been serving great food since 1971. This is where locals go for huge servings at affordable prices. They serve breakfast 24 hours a day and the plates are HUGE.<//Review>

Everyone loves Angelo's. It's a staple of the local area/culture. They have a huge menu with everything from hamburgers and gyros to burritos and breakfast platters. The food is always reasonably priced and I'm always happy with how much I get for my money. That's probably the biggest selling point for me with this place. The only thing I have against Angelo's are their hamburgers. They put a lot of lettuce and tomato on them, and they just seem to be missing some flavor or pizaz overall. Just my preference though, and everything else is excellent. They even added beer to their menu a few years back.< /Text>

<review>The burgers are huge and very tasty and they give you an enormous amount of french fries with the combo.  The chocolate milkshake tasted like it was made with real ice cream. We had planned to go to In and Out but saw Angelo's on the way and decided to try it.  We were so glad we did.  It was far better than any meal I've had at In and Out.  Definitely will go back in the future.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Hungry saver the other night... Google said they were closed but the drive thru was very much open, so we were happy. Their food has always been a favorite of mine, especially the zucchini fries. They always give you a lot, so you never are still hungry. Staff is nice but can be "real and raw" sometimes but I like that sometimes. Just need to update site.</Review>

On the other side, the food selection is huge you can get Mexican, Greek  or American. The food portions are massive and most important of all it's tasty!
The prices are some of the lowest food prices in the area.
If I'm back to San Diego I'll make another stop here for sure.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

The place might not be the cleanest, but that gets drowned out by the amazing service and food. Ive tried many of the shakes and they taste good, although I'm sensitive to dairy and it usually sends me to the bathroom. The zucchini sticks are great, they were the first zucchini fries I've tried however. The burgers are quite large, if you're looking for something different, I would definitely recommend one of the taco plates such as the fish tacos. The owner has been there for 40 years and he still runs the grill, cash register, and everything. He's a great guy!</Review>< Rate>

Usually I'm very happy with my visits but today i checked online to compare pricing for various restaurants and found Angelo's to be the best.  Imagine my surprise when i walked in to find them not only higher then posted online, but they absolutely refused to match the prices on their own menu, but they also refused to give me the contract info for their absentee boss.  I was told that he would be in around lunch time when i was trying to get breakfast for my family.  How does lunch time help me get breakfast?

I have been a customer of this location for over 10yrs and don't think I'll ever be back.  How difficult is it to match the price and make sure it gets changed?  If you want to post your prices online it is your responsibility to update them.  If you don't then you should be willing to honor the posted pricing.  Extremely Bad Service!!! Very unhappy.<//text>

First was a burrito I ordered with no cheese as I'm lactose intolerant that had cheese loaded in the end I finished with. The last visit they got the order almost correct besides they forgot my brothers hot dog and tried to tell me they didn't when that was the only thing that wasn't on the tray... They made it but it took an additional 20 mins for a plain hot dog that the original order took 25 mins.

Ordered 5 shakes. All more closely resembled flavored cold milk. Very watery. I understand they were busy, and we were holding up the drive thru, you can at least ask us to pull forward and park, and do them right instead of fast.<//Text>

I go here often with my parents because their fries and zucchini fries are so good! Customer service is great too. I like that they're open pretty late so if I'm hanging out with friends we could just go here to eat. I went here with my friend last week and it was here first time and they were kind to even give us candy with our meal. Now if I go back again with my parents I hope I get a another lollipop!

Great burgers, fries were a lil bland. They weren't that busy wen we got there, but it took them a long time to even acknowledge us standing there. It was about a good  15 mins before they finally took our order.  Need to wrk on their customer service skills to be honest.</text>

I would give 5 stars if going off the food alone , but the quality of service is hit or miss . Been coming here for years since a kid . Recently waited in line to order for 10 minutes,  not one person behind the counter made eye contact with any of the customers in line or took any orders . Ended up leaving . Sad cause the grub is awesome and vary large quantity.</Review>

<user>117906463289844495665</user><Time>1472146824690<//Time><text>Usually I'm very happy with my visits but today i checked online to compare pricing for various restaurants and found Angelo's to be the best.  Imagine my surprise when i walked in to find them not only higher then posted online, but they absolutely refused to match the prices on their own menu, but they also refused to give me the contract info for their absentee boss.  I was told that he would be in around lunch time when i was trying to get breakfast for my family.  How does lunch time help me get breakfast?

I have been a customer of this location for over 10yrs and don't think I'll ever be back.  How difficult is it to match the price and make sure it gets changed?  If you want to post your prices online it is your responsibility to update them.  If you don't then you should be willing to honor the posted pricing.  Extremely Bad Service!!! Very unhappy.</text>< user_name>

<text>I'm from Utah, and we have a restaurant called Crown Burger that's amazing. The menu at Angelo's was similar to Crown, only with Mexican food. I was excited. I ordered a gyro plate, and it was fairly tasty (nowhere near Crown Burger quality, but with the same price). I was unimpressed with the service, however, and the place was dirty. Also, the salad came out with huge veggie chunks that looked like a 5 year old had cut them, and the lettuce tasted like it hadn't been washed. So, the food is okay, the place is filthy, and the service is a joke.< /text>< userid>

<text>I never had a bad experience like some of the comments. Burgers are good and filling. Love the onions on them. Onions rings are not that great but good. Milkshakes are bomb. Fries are pretty good. And they always give you a ton of fries. Lots of variety on the menu. Cheapest bean and cheese burrito around and huge. Recommended to try it out and get your own opinion on the place.</text></record>

One of those divey hole-in-the-wall places that has excellent food in a huge menu with the variety of Mexican food and traditional hamburgers. Yum. Last time I had the veggie burger and it was excellent and this time I had a breakfast burrito again excellent.</Review>

Easily pulled in off the Interstate
onto the Coast Highway and Windward Way.   The proprietor,  Angelo,  working behind the counter was very helpful and friendly.  Super clean burger restaurant with one of our fav's, homemade onion rings. Angelo has an interest in gardening, tending beautiful large Elephant Ears, a lemon tree, and other tropical plantings around his business.< /review>

Maybe it was just because they were busy . They had a great looking menu way to many items maybe the cooks are over whelmed with many items cooking all at the same time.< /Text><Date>1499657695483</Date>< Rate>

What's the thing about Angelo's. It's different. It's unique and it's only in oceanside. They sport the red and yellow. Which at first I thought it was an In N out. But the Hispanic version! There menu is creative and diverse. From gyros, to burgers and burritos. Breakfast all day. Unique desert menu. Your eyes are glued to the big sign in the drive through trying to decide what to pick. The price maybe be a little. But the portions sizes. You will get it for lunch and dinner. You will see these locations scattered as if it was a field of flowers. Don't be fooled. They good. I call it one of Oceanside's unique talents. Whether you dine in our hit the drive through. It's good. The staff has your back when you order extra ranch, unlike other places that charge you a nickle, dime, and if they super stingy. A quarter. Have your wallet full and a deep appetite. Try this place out!</review>

They should use gloves when they prepare your food. Dirty restaurant/tables. Food quality has suffered over the past few years.</Review>

<Text>Do. Not. Eat. Here. This place is a health hazard! I'm sitting at a table enjoying some so-so French toast when I feel something up my pant leg. Imagine my surprise and disgust when I stand up and shake out a 3" long 1" wide cockroach!!! The 2 employees try to kill it but fail as it runs into the kitchen!!! Then I'm told, "I'm sorry, sir. The door is open." Like, I guess it's ok now to have cockroaches in your restaurant if your front door doesn't close all the way.<//Text>< pics>

This place is so shockingly dirty and run down it amazes me they are not closed by the health department. They have not repaired so many broken tiles and other surfaces, exposing difficult to clean/porous surfaces, that I am sure roaches must run rampant at night. The staff allows the trash to pile up and spill out of the receptacles and the floor under the mats the cooks walk on looks like it is never cleaned. Soda station also looks hard to thoroughly clean and likely a perfect spot for bugs. Absolutely gross. That said, great fries. I tell myself I am building up my immune system when I gather the guts up to grab an order and get out before I psych myself out to the point I can't eat them.
Bottom line, they seem to be busy enough so why the owner doesn't show his/her clients enough respect to remodel or at least provide a clean setting is disrespectful in my opinion.< /review>

Went for lunch at Angelis. My friend and I both ordered gyros plate. The Pita bread was hard. The gyros was dry.
Too expensive and most of all I observed  the food handlers do not wear gloves. The owner should insist on a healthy enviorment.  Never again.<//review>

Where to start. Ugh, I was the decision maker on this one and I failed miserably. The floors were sticky and so dirty. We decided to eat outside which was a great idea because it was warm inside. The food was not great, not even good-like I said I failed on this one. We will never eat here again.</text>

<review>Really good food but very dirty bathrooms. Review would have been a 5 if the bathrooms would be clean or at least smell clean. I have been to this place multiple of times and at different times of the day so I know it's not the "lunch hour rush"< /review></record>

<review>A local small chain restaurant serving breakfast and specializing in burgers. Food is ok - not bad but not great. Servers are pretty friendly. Unfortunately most of the tables needed to be clean. Trash recepticles were splattered with ketchup. Bathroom with lots of graffiti. If owner payed attention to these issues it would make a big difference.</review>< pictures>

Very good breakfast of 3 eggs, 2 bacon (crisp, good), 2 tasty sausages and 2 sourdough slices for $5.50 (special)?! Awesome! Sure, the place could use a renovation but then the prices would have to go up. I wish they would give it a moderate sprucing up and scrubbing, though. Overall, I say yay!<//text>

Burgers and fries are a thousand times better than in n out, but the only reason it doesn’t get 5 stars is cause the drive thru is incredibly slow.. it’s easier to just go inside, but otherwise it’s worth it!<//review>

Food was reasonable, prices were good, menu selection was enormous.  Guy at the drive-thru window was very friendly, but service was terribly slow.  Wrong food orders were coming out of the kitchen one after another.  We were told that everyone on shift (except our drive-thru window guy) was new.  I totally believe it.  I don't wait that long for food at most sit-down restaurants and I have surely never waited that long in a drive-thru.  I would have left without my food if I did not have a line of cars  blocking me in and I hadn't already paid for my food.< /text>

Average burger place.  A bit pricey.  We ordered for delivery through Door Dash, and we didn't get everything we ordered.  They shorted us one burger and one drink.  Never doing that again!</Text>

The burger was great, besides that they got the entire order wrong. Sour cream on all the things we asked for none, guac on some, not on the food we asked. It was $40 we had to throw away because it was just too far a drive to get back........ But, it did LOOK amazing.<//Text>

<review>Had the Huevos Rancheros and was disappointed that there was no meat.  The portions were generous but there were 4 tortillas with an egg and veggie paste.  However there is a wide variety on their menu and they are open 24 hrs.  Maybe just chose the wrong selection.<//review><Name>Randolph Fong</Name>< userid>

Can find combo deals and a good spot on front of a flat tv if you want to catch the game. The Mexican food is eeehh, iced coffee is better on the picture, and the bathroom is right there where u sit so a lot of times you get that bathroom smell run through the place. Inside and outside is a unique bar sitting area you can sit at and the location is perfect for a day at the beach off of coast highway.< /review><name>Damien LierOmen<//name>< Date>

First time customer here. I ordered a side of fries through the drive through and was thoroughly disappointed. The portion size was ideal, but the fries themselves were under-salted and over-oiled.

On top of that, the ketchup packets were covered in oil, which made keeping the mess contained especially difficult.< /text>

First of all my order had a written receipt. On my hand-written receipt was my order a turkey burger no pickle no onion no tomato. What did I get a turkey burger with tomato and pickle. Then they forgot to give me my ATM card back so I had to go back to the store and pick it up. This is my third time there that I've had a problem so I'm not going to go back because I give places three times and that's it.< /review>

<Response>None</Response><text>They certainly aren't stingy with their fries, and they're crispy too, I tried the pastrami burger and was unimpressed, from now on its gonna be a hamburger for me. The pastrami just added too much bulk and the flavor didn't go very well with the hamburger.< /text>< userid>

So I went to order and straight from the beginning this women taking my order was rude, then I ordered bfast figured how bad can they mess up a couple eggs and potatoes?????? Got my food took a bite and wasn't good at all but I said well I paid for it might as well finish, about my fourth fork I find a large piece of metal in my food. Showed it to them they asked if I want a new plate I said no I want my money back. Even after they saw the metal they were rude.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Garbage.  I've been going here since 1999.  As well as some of the other locations.  I used to love this spot.  This locations manager Tony is a looney toon and doesnt see how poorly everything is being cooked these days.  Half cooked bacon.  Little to no cheese all clumped at the bottom of a burrito.  Hash browns are the worst any where.  They should be classified as mashed potatoes.  The pico taste like cooked veggies.  Everything is rushed and these delusional cooks would never eat this garbage...ever.  black rotted avocado.  They dont care..there location is so good they will get business no matter what...so they just dont even try.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I normally don't wright reviews but this place was so bad I feel it is my patriotic duty to warn people of it so, here it goes.
I ordered the bacon monster combo and my wife ordered the chicken burger. the hamburger was large but the patty was about 1/4 inch thick. The overwhelming majority of the hamburger was lettuce and bun. The lettuce comprised the majority being approximately 1 inch thick. After removing the lettuce I was left with a pretty unimpressive burger, fires and a coke for $10.00. The chicken burger was very thin as well and dry and tasted like leather. It's been sitting in my stomach like a rock for 2 days now.</review>

Takes forever and they ALWAYS mess up my order. Just spend $20 on a shake, a burger combo, and an order of onion rings. I get home and the french fries for my combo are missing. You'd think I'd learn to check my bag... but I shouldn't have to. Overpriced and bad service, boo.< /Review>

<text>This place is crawling with extremely agressive homeless. We just encountered a homeless man who demanded money, and would not stop following us until we bought him food. He blew cigarette smoke into my 9 year old daughters face. I told management, then we left. Manager was nice, but said he couldnt make the guy leave. He even followed us back to our car. Called the Oceanside police who stated they would send someone out when they can.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>THIS RATING IS FOR THIS ANGELOS IN PARTICULAR.
I believe the owners/managers name was Tony... very rude. the other angelos I have never had a problem at.. good food, accurate orders.
I came here for the first time... got the wrong order and then was treated terribly like it was my mistake. not good and will not return here. would NOT RECCOMEND.</text>< Pictures>

<date>1448866435319<//date><review>This place is amazing. I've been coming here for almost my entire life and these guys have only disappointed me a hand full of times. Their burgers are great; especially their big mouth burger. The Gyro is hands down the best Gyro you can buy around town; even beating out these specialty "Greek" restaurants. Their fries are amazing and they're better with thousand island dressing. Their portions are insane for what you pay. Grant it, not everything is amazing on the menu but you definitely get your money's worth in terms of portion. I consider this my home away from home since for up until recently, I would eat here at least once or even twice a week. Things I recommend: Gryo without onions or tomatoes, chili cheese fries, regular fries, big mouth burger without onions, carne Asada burrito, California burrito, their salads are friggin huge, breakfast burritos and any breakfast plates with pancakes.</review><gmapID>0x80dc6e35c448f34b:0x88acab4dd60a70d2</gmapID></record>

During nights on the weekend (friday, saturday) the service is pretty good, you get your food prepared fast and correctly. During the early afternoon times, mainly weekdays, it's very different. I went in on a Tuesday afternoon a little after 1 and ordered a turkey burger combo. The lady just dropped my bag on the counter, and walked off. When I looked inside, the fries were pretty burnt-- as in black at the ends, hard and dry. Also, you can really tell the restuarant isn't cleaned too often; the countertops are dirty, so are some of the tables and the walls near the front counter (didn't see anywhere else). They also had a man outside the establishment asking for money staring inside. This was all on the same Tuesday visit.<//Text>

We spent $40 for three people (even splitting an order of onion rings). Only to be charged $.75 per thing of ranch? Huge pet peeve!< /text>

(Translated by Google) Good place for breakfast with a variety of food and good taste, the bad thing is that the food has a bit of excess fat but I do recommend it!

(Translated by Google) Coffe tastes horrible, nasty food and expensive, never again👎

The coffee tastes horrible, bad food, bad bacon, should give better presentation in the dishes, it takes away the hunger just to see the dish, bad experience traveling from Los angeles to San Diego, I do not recommend it.
