<Review>Was at Calvary Chapel last weekend with my husband. I needed to walk out to use a restroom (couldn’t hold) and two gentlemen at the doors wouldn’t let me back in saying “I would destruct if I get back in”...doesn’t matter if my husband was still inside... Interesting that the pastor was preaching about the doors in church are always open. I don’t really want to say anything negative, the pastor was cool and interesting to listen to... I just was very surprised such thing happened, not sure who created such rules for this church! Strange feeling.... even though, at first sight I thought “what a cool church, and community overall”
It was second time I was there, first time for actual service.<//Review>< date>

From the moment that I first walked in the door ~8 years ago, to now, this weekend, I have felt blessed with sense of fellowship and community that I have not felt with many other churches. This church offers amazing family and fellowship in Christ, and I recommend it to all who are nearby and are looking for a church, wether it be for just passing through the area, or as a more permanent church near home.</Text>

This church is a true bible-believing Jesus-following people-loving community-based congregation. It is easy to feel known here, and the teaching pastor, John Randall, is a great teacher. I would highly recommend checking out this church if you are in the area and in need of some good teaching and fellowship.

God bless, Jesus love you! :)< /Text>

<review>Pastor John teaches the word of God and is one of the best communicators of the Bible I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. If you want to grow in your walk with the Lord and know the truth, this is the fellowship you want to be a part of. I am so grateful that God has raised up such an amazing, caring, and Godly man to shepard his sheep.  All glory be to God!!!< /review><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

<Review>CCSJC is a friendly, welcoming church!!  The teaching from Pastor John Randall is unique in the way that he doesn't waste time telling a bunch of stories,  but always begins with asking everyone to open their Bibles to the Holy Scriptures! He doesn't bounce around from one book one week to another book the next. He continues where he left off the previous week. That helps in teaching and learning Gods Word in context, which is crucial when studying the Bible! Pastor John is passionate about who the LORD is and desires for all to come to the saving faith of our LORD & Savior, Jesus Christ!! I can't say enough good things about this church and i thank the LORD often for leading us here!!</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Many years ago I bounced around from church to church including Coast Hills, Saddleback, Capo Beach, Mission Hills etc. I came across this one and from that point on, I found my church home. Pastor John actually came to my house and baptized me personally at the beach by my house. I don’t know if any of these Pastors at these other churches would of done that. This was the only church that I went to that I actually felt connected and plugged in. I suggest, if you were like me looking for a church to call home,  try giving this church a try. Pastor John is a phenomenal teacher, you won’t be disappointed. God Bless 🙌< /review>

The Spirit of God is among them. Just from one day I felt the love and peace of Christ from the pastors to the ushers. They made me feel welcomed having never known me. If that wasn't reason enough to come back, they teach the word of God. I'm thankful the Lord gave me such peace to be there.<//Text>

I'm new to the area currently looking for a home church, I recently came and visited this church with my wife and infant son. My family and I left so out of place, the ushers didn't greet us making us feel not welcomed. They didn't talk to us until we tired to enter the sanctuary with our infant son, a man told us we weren't allowed to be in the sanctuary and were taken to this separate room with a projector to see the service cause our information infant son would interrupt the pastor during the service and he was trying to convince us to leave our son with in an infant class. First of all, I would never leave my infant son with strangers especially, the first time at this church, when I been to churches where the parents are allowed to bring their babies into the sanctuary to worship and hear the word. A church should have be loving first, everything else comes after. I would never come back to here again.<//text>

CCSJC is THE CHURCH for those of you that are looking for a BIBLE teaching church with a Pastor that sees himself as the Shepherd of his flock and teaches, preaches and loves them accordingly; who practices what he preaches and whose wife loves the Lord as much as he does and shows it in her participation!!!!</review>

<text>I had a great experience here. I had to get an oil change done and my squeaky brakes checked out. The team here took my car and gave me a time estimate. I decided to walk around the area while they worked on my car.

When I got back, before they started doing the work on the brakes, they showed me what was happening and allowed me to make a very informed decision on how to proceed with my brakes. The fact that they waited to put the wheels back on my vehicle until I came back from walking around to explain to me what was going on is a testament to their commitment to customer service. The pricing is fair, the people are honest, and the timeline they provide is accurate. I will continue to come here.< /text>< Pics>

Came here due to emergency on my 2002 chevy cavalier. Engine vapors and leaking fluids. The guys here took great care of me and the vehicle. Charged me honest rates. Will go back in the future.</text>

Excellent repair shop. I know a little about cars, but not much. They are always willing to explain exactly what's going on and how to fix what I need with the budget I have. Very straight forward and genuinely good people.<//review>

I have been going to hai for over 25 years now. They are great at repairing my cars. Never had any problems with any of the repairs. They have saved me a lot of money on repairs compared to other shops. Very honest. I highly recommend them<//Text>

I can't say enough good things about this gem of an auto repair shop in my neighborhood near University Heights. Whether it pertains to my Dodge Intrepid, or my aunt's Hyundai Accent - whether it's a cracked radiator, rusted out heater core, or new axle shafts (CV Joints) Hai's has never let me down.

It is a pleasure to deal with Brian Diep, service manager. Brian always gives me options, keeps me informed of time frames, and turns his work around quickly and fairly. Their pricing in competitive and it remains a friendly and well run neighborhood shop. Highly recommend Hai's!< /Text>

When we moved to San Diego we had some major car issues. Finding a new mechanic when you don't know anyone in town is never fun and always stressful. So happy to have found Angie, Brian and team could not be more pleased. Have been going to Hais for about two years now they are trustworthy, honest, hardworking and accommodating. They have treated us well from oil changes to body work. Thanks for everything!< /review>

It doesn't have curb appeal or gimics and gizmos to draw you in,
But what it does have is hard working, dependable mechanics who will get the job done. So if that's what your lookn 4, then that's the place to get yourself a good family mechanic.</Text>

I have been coming to Hai’s Auto Repair for 5 years from now. I could not be more pleased. They ALWAYS take care of my car, efficiently and fairly. I don’t write many reviews, but Hai’s deserves one. I trust them completely with my car. They always clearly explain what needs to be done and give me options
when it is possible.  Bottom line: their prices are always fair, the service is great and they are wonderful people.<//Review>

<Review>What a great automotive shop: full service, including transmission repair, engine overhaul; they do it all, small or big repair. They do oil changes, smog check, brake service, tune ups. They are a one stop shop for anything you need.they are competent-- they do the job right the first time and above all they are honest and priced reasonably. I love this shop. There is a reason why they are highly rated on social media.  Try them. You will be hooked. Don't waste your time going anywhere else.< /Review>< name>

Fantastic! Paint job looks great! Super fresh  looks like it just came from the dealer! And, there were no unexpected "surprises". Any work needed outside the quote was done only with authorization from us. Brian and his Mom was very knowledgeable and helpful. We were treated very well like family and will definitely go back for any other services. I'm a real customer and this is a real review. Dont get it twisted! Thanks again Brian!

Brian and the team at Hai’s are great. I had an electrical issue with my van, many places refused to work on my van because of its age (1990) but Brian happily took on the job and fixed the short I had in my electrical system for a very reasonable price. He was great at communicating with me through the whole process<//Text>

Hai’s is the only repair shop in San Diego that I trust wholeheartedly. They are extremely knowledgeable, honest, expedient and reasonably priced. I have taken my cars there for over fifteen years. They’ve always done an excellent job no matter if I brought them my BMW, Mercedes or Sable. I recommend them very highly. Unlike other shops Angie, the owner is able diagnose any problem within minutes.</text>

<review>Very courteous and fast service!  The price seemed really reasonable and fair, especially compared to other mechanics I have seen in the past.  They explained everything to me clearly and did not push additional services on me.  My car is old, so they just  took care of the immediate issue and discussed the other potential concerns with my car.  I like it when mechanics take the time to talk to you so that you understand what is going on with your car.  Overall, I had a great experience and will go back the next time I need an auto service.  I definitely recommend!!</review>< time>

Skilled mechanics who are competent with both newer and older model cars.  If they don't have the part they can get it...American, Asian and European.  Fair pricing for the work, everything itemized clearly on invoice. Honest quotes, will call you if they find anything unexpected before doing work and try to help you stay in budget. These folks are happy to show you defective part & explain the problem in plain English.  Worth my driving across town to keep my vehicles running strong.<//text>

These people are awesome!!! I’m from Northern California down in the area for work. I was stressed when my front end started to make noise and was hearing metal on breaking . They took my car in first thing and did a full inspection and showed me the new parts I had just had put on were defective. They got me all new Genuine parts from Honda and fixed everything. There price was great for the work they did and they still gave me a discount.Even though it was a wheel issue they did a full car inspection for me being that I drive so much which was awesome  . They were great staffed ,friendly and very fast . I highly recommend , and I don’t recommend anything rarely and find the negative in everything but here I can’t find a thing . I wish they were in Northern California for sure would stay a customer.. 32 years in business and now I know why . Stop by for any auto needs you have< /review>

<Review>BEST PLACE IN SAN DIEGO! We’ve been going to Hai’s since 1992 and they have always served us well! A little Vietnamese “mom & pop” auto repair place and they have always been fair, very reasonable prices and honest. We lived in the Hillcrest area for years and when we moved further away we tried using other auto repair shops but Hai’s has always beat the other places in price and quality. I highly recommend Hai’s!!< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80d954e64e0c1f25:0x9b17cd794f2f2b1c</Gmap_id><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

<review>I had just moved to San Diego, CA from Texas and had to complete all of the requirements to become a resident....get my license, register my vehicle, etc.  In order to finish my vehicle registration I had to get a smog test and saw that this place had good reviews.  I went and was please with the quick, efficient, and excellent customer service.  It was a little busy when I went, but the attendant was honest and gave me an estimated time of completion and was right on time.  I will definitely keep them in mind for any future Auto repair needs.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I did the smog test, oil change and tire rotation of my car here. Friendly people lower rates than surrounding locations and great service.
It was really quick and i was just relaxing half an hour down the street industrial grinds coffee shop.<//Review>

I have been coming here since 2004. The one time i went to closer mechanic because i moved,i sorta got ripped off. Honest,reasonable,competent. If it's not fixed the way it should be, they will make it right,usually with no further charge. I consider them a gem. I have been keeping them a secret from newcomers but since i'm moving out of state,give them your patronage. Can be very busy if you come in on certain days. I honestly will miss doing business with them!< /text>

Was delighted with their no nonsense approach.   I've used Hais many times through the years for all sorts of jobs - from break jobs to smogs.  Always leave feeling taken care of and that's why I return.
The family that runs it are good people - AND they really know their stuff!< /Text>

They are my mom and pop auto repair spot. They are honest and helpful. They replaced my starter and the new one was defective. They sent a mechanic to where my car was to look at it when they determined that it was the starter they offered to have my car towed at their expense. I have an older car which breaks down often and they always find the part.... always. I like them and would recommend their service.< /Text>

<text>Hai's Auto Repair II, Inc. provided excellent service the minute I brought my car in for a smog check. I arrived midweek at 4 p.m. and only had to wait 20 minutes. And while I waited they had free WiFi, so I was able to use my Nexus to read. Next time I need any car service, I will come to Hai's Auto. They offer complete car repair service on any type of foreign or domestic cars.< /text>< Response>

I pulled in to get a smog check.They had me drive right into a bay. I was in and out of there in less than 30 minutes. This crew seems pretty solid, and I'll be recommending them to others.</Review>

<response>None</response><Text>I am surprised at the good reviews on here..
Woman is rude to customers

I do not want to sit on here and rant and rave on my very bad experience with the woman who runs this shop

Basically the woman flat out lied to me
Kept getting crossed up in what she was saying ...
Claimed to have spent two hours working on my carburetor that needed adjustments and quoted 100$ if she fixed it

Then when I go to pick it up, said she could not fix the problem and still wanted full price
Then said thy they do not do work on carburetors ????!?
Then I asked her what she did do during the two hours and she just closed her eyes at me  and got upset raising her voice saying ah looked at it

Over all horrible experience from the phone until I left ....

I am very disappointed in her. She was dishonest to me.
I would in no way recommend going here.

{'time': 1562051408937, 'text': 'Elijah,\n\nI will not let you slander our reputation without stating the truth.  i will clear up the story so that is is more clear for the public to know from a mechanics point of view then legal.\n\nFrom the beginning, you called me asking for a quote on a repair that was diagnosed at your own mechanic that you\'ve known and trusted for years.  I provided you with this quote so you can take out a loan to do the repairs.  You stated that you needed a car to rent so you asked if i can cover your rental cost at enterprise so you have transportation during the repairs.  After, you tow the car into my shop.  It has no compression in any cylinder.  It did not start, it had to be pushed.  Next, during the repairs, i found hole in your story such as you changed new spark plugs.  I showed you in person that they were old.  You even had a leaking radiator that you were aware of but wanted to replace yourself.  It was obvious to me that you had history with your truck and seemed as if you knew what was going on.  After the repairs, the car ran (in which it did not when it came in). The truck sometimes shut off while idling however you brought the car on empty and i could not even test drive it.  So please do not act like we did nothing for you.  In the end, it was misdiagnosed why your mechanic that you trusted so much.  But it did run which it did not when it was towed in.  We even did extra repairs and did not even charge you but we\'ll let that go for now.  Later we found out the the car was properly diagnosed at a different shop, MONTHS BEFORE you took it to your mechanic.  But you IGNORED IT.  Understand if were already diagnosed a bad motor, WHY would not get quotes for a valve job?\n\nAs for the legal matter and the "violations" i received.  When we visited with the Bureau at the beginning of the matter, there was no citations or violations issued.  When later we went to court the violations were only due to the language of the writing not the repairs of the vehicle.\n\nAs for your spending $3200.00 with us.  600.00 was on the rental in which we covered for you although you busted the windshield and of course your credit card was not on file therefore i paid for you busted windshield costing me almost $400.00.  Then, we let you borrow a personal car in which you blew the engine, costing me a rental i use for other people.  It was not our responsibility to help or provide you with a rental but because you came recommended, in which i did regrettably make the mistake of doing.\n\nLastly, as for the court issue.  You are nothing more than a cynical money hungry person.  You threaten us with your "legal sources".  Now, you state you want $10,000.00 to settle the case.  Of course i will appeal.\n\n-Brian'}</Resp>

I got the zetton soy ramen which was nothing special besides being the restaurants moniker. The broth was a little to strong and just didn't blend together well. The chashu was good and they give you a decent amount especially if you order extra. The noodles were chewy but the ramen as a whole wasn't perfect but good for a ramen fix<//text>

I lived in japan for about 2 years as a United States Marine. I missed the culture and the food, and honestly every time I enter in I'm always greeted with a smile by the staff and always given a welcome in Japanese. I know a tiny bit of Japanese and I try my best to respond in Japanese. (I hope the staff don't think I'm being rude :P). But anyway the food taste exactly as If I was back in japan. That's why they will always have me comeback again and again. Rated 5 stars.<//review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>The noodle wasn't cooked completely, had some crunchy taste. The inner part of the pork on the soup was cold. The soup itself tasted awful, it was smelly. The restaurant was full with some gas smell.  I really don't recommend this ramen place.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>First time visit.  Great customer service and big portions, with good prices.  Ramen noodles was smooth and good flavor.  However, the soup was bland and the habanero dipping sauce wasn't even hot. Chili oil tasted stale.  The meat wasn't fresh.  It tasted like it was prepared several days earlier and then warmed up with the microwave.  BTW: I don't think this is a Japanese Ramen restaurant because the wait and cooking staff were Latinos and they were speaking Spanish.</Text>< pictures>

The Ramen is awesome. Order the spicy garlic TanTam. Ambience sucked. They had heavy metal and grunge playing the whole time I was there.< /Review>

It was finally open after coming several times at the wrong time, don’t know if it’s new owner or what but it wasn’t as good as before and now you get sat down with menu, get up to order and pay, get up again to get your ramen and  get up again for forks, hot sauce, water, to go container. Definitely not coming back...</Review>

I live by the college, and make sure that every Thursday night after class, I stop in and grab myself a bowl of ramen with my friend. I've haven't skipped a week in two months and have no plans to stop any time soon. Great service, great food, great prices.<//review>

My wife ate pork salt ramen and I ate bibimbap early this afternoon.

Both order taste good and the servings are geneous. Price is reasonable.
We share food as we always do.

We plan to be back pretty soon.<//Review>

That have a good ramen.

If if you are around the neighborhood and crave for ramen, this place is a good option. Although I believe their original location in costa mesa tastes better, this place serves a decent bowel of ramen.

Tips: if you go during lunch hours 11:3 to 3 pm, you can enjoy a small bowel from a few choices for 2 dollars.</review>

This restaurant was highly recommended by a friend who lives here locally so we had to try it! There are a few different options and they all sounded great. We ordered 2 different types of ramen bowls and a wide order of the chicken fried rice. All of it was absolutely delicious!! Best fried rice I've had in years. The green tea wss also awesome, we ordered one hot and one cold and both were refreshing. Staff was very friendly and accommodating . Service was quite fast as well. If you like pho or ramen this place is a MUST TRY!!< /Text>

It was just okay. There are defiantly better ramen places near by. I personally didn't care for the broth and as much jabanero miso as I added, I never got it to be any spicier.< /text>

<Text>Fantastic!! I just had the miso ramen. I substituted the pork broth and it was amazing! If I lived in LA, I'd be back at least once a week. Glad I gave it a shot.

The menu has an extensive list of ramen varieties, including Korean themed bowls and vegetarian broths. They also have donburi and Japanese curry options.< /Text>< Pictures>

Zetton on it!  Zetton on it!

Ramen Zetton, the popular Costa Mesa ramen shop, has a new branch nearby me in Cypress.  For their soft opening, Ramen Zetton has priced their ramen bowls from $5 - $7.  Being a ramen lover & not one to pass up a discount, I hurried down to Ramen Zetton, eagerly awaiting slurping up some piping hot ramen.

The traditional ramen condiments are well represented - chili oil, white pepper grinder, vinegar, red chili pepper & house made spicy miso chili paste.

The house made spicy miso chili paste has a definite kick to it.  Not for spice weaklings.

I went for their signature Sesame Miso Tantan ramen ($7, reg. price $8.50)-

The tantan ramen broth is thick, almost curry-like.  Adding the entire jar of spicy miso chili paste, the broth became almost akin to marinara.  Plus, a splash of vinegar, some chili pepper, a drizzling of chili oil, freshly ground white pepper & a splash or 2 of vinegar. The vinegar is what really kicked the flavor profile up a notch.   Hearty & rich, the sesame miso tantan consisted of a special blend of sesame & miso, chicken broth, green onion, ground pork & vegetable puree.  The ramen had a good bite to it.  My preference would've enjoyed them more al dente, but I was not disappointed with the wonderfully thick broth & juicy chunks of ground pork.  At $7, a delicious bowl that's a must get!

Not feeling soup today?  Ramen Zetton's simplistic menu also has various rice dishes & gyoza for your consideration.

Service was good.  I arrived a few minutes before opening.  The father of the owner of Ramen Zetton was running the place.  The cook called in sick & one from the Costa Mesa location was brought in to save the day.  My water was refilled on a couple occasions & I was even given containers of the spicy miso chili paste to take home, w/o asking.  Not a place for large groups, seating is minimal with a few tables, booths & bar seating.

Parking is in private lot.  Hard to spot from the street, Ramen Zetton is located behind Oodles of Noodles Pho Restaurant & adjacent to Poki Roll.

Hurry & get down to Zetton!  Ramen Zetton serves up soothing bowls of ramen that are priced cheaper than their competitors.  The sesame miso tantan ramen was a winner & I'm eagerly anticipating trying their other ramen offerings.  I can't procrastinate, though, as I want to take advantage of Ramen Zetton's soft opening pricing.  Hungry for soup? Check out Ramen Zetton!

Highly recommend!

<name>Pete Shieh</name><time>1470258053632< /time><rate>3< /rate><Text>Former place for Cambinos and Teriyaki Monkey Wave rises Ramen Zetton. If you've been to this location, you would know how small this kitchen and seating is. I would say it seats about 24-30 people max.  Lots of parking in the lot, near by Icon (For you craft beer people)

As for the Ramen, prices are still discounted for Classic ($5), Old School ($5), Special Salt ($6), Special Soy ($6). Of course, we tried one of each.  The noodles for the $5 are thinner (Chuka-Soba), while the Ramen for the $6 are thicker. The broth for the Classic tasted packaged, the Old school Shoyu had a light soy (my favorite) and the Specials had this Vegetable broth which was a bit too much I thought.

Non of the broth tasted in depth, unlike those day long tonkotsu broths but for what you get, it's okay. The chicken that does come with the noodle tasted like shoyu braised with sugar and that was just okay too. Kitakata is nearby, personally I would go there instead.

Service here with one person is pretty awesome I have to say, even with a packed house.
Yep check in gets you free soda currently.  I will have to make another trip to try the other noodles.< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
My mom originally found this place and bought her bedroom set here and it has lasted 20 years. I recently decided to look into getting a headboard but much to my surprise I found actually what I was looking for. I was greeted by a warm friendly face and got all my information and told them we would be back. I ended up going to serval different places but they didn't compare to this company so I ended up back there the next day and ordered my headboard frame with shelves. They did have it in stock and we set up an appointment for delivery and install. I had an afternoon appointment and they were able to squeeze me in earlier than expected and I was so thrilled. They were very good and took no time to put it together. I am completely happy with my product and I would definitely recommend this company to anyone. Thank you for making my first experience a great one.</Review>

We moved to Stockton recently and needed a new bed frame for our Avocado mattress. I looked up different furniture stores and chose this one based on it's reviews. I wasn't disappointed. Staff was helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. They pointed us to quite a few options they had available, since we needed a frame that would support around 600lbs (it's a heavy mattress, and we're not lightweight people). Delivery and setup was a breeze, the guys were great and quick.

We'll be back here for sure when we're ready to really get the new house set up. Their selection is great, I loved a lot of the furnishings they had to offer. Especially a gorgeous chandelier near the front door.

Definitely recommend.</Text>

Simply fantastic! This is the place to go in the Stockton Area for furniture and mattresses. The product selection is absolutely amazing and the prices are great!!  This is a family run business and they treat all of their customers like they are part of the family, too. Thank you to Emmie (owner) and her team. We'll be sending our friends to your store, too. Great job!!!<//review>

I was referred to Home style furniture from my friend. They were very happy with the wonderful service. I had to to find a low bed, for my husband in a w/c coming out of hospital. Emmie found just what  I needed

The mattess and temp frame was there just in time
I ordered adjustable frame and they delivered and set up for us, when came in.
The men who delivered were very professional and polite thumbs up !< /Text>

< Review>
I bought couches from here a few years back, they told me it was leather but they where vinyl and it started tearing apart within a few months.  I got a glass dinning table with chairs and the bolts off the chair legs started loosening up very cheaply made.  I bought a bed for my son, luckily nothing ever happen to it since he never slept it it.<//Review>

A few years ago I went to Home Styles Furniture with a friend of mine who was buying furniture for her new home; so when my husband and I brought our new home I just had to go shopping at HSF! I just love our new house and how I have decorated it with HSF! Thank you for being so affordable to furnish my whole house practiclly 🤗💙💙<//Review>

Service was ok, as so was the delivery and set-up. However, the quality of the furniture isn’t the best. Especially the bedroom mattresses. A total waste of money. Also do not fall for the “warranty” it’s nonexistent.<//Review>

We've never had a bad experience at Baywood.  Wendy is a delight to work with!  The grounds are kept in great condition, the food is always excellent, and the staff is always friendly.  We enjoy photographing weddings here every year, and continually look forward to our next.  If you're looking for an indoor-outdoor venue in Humboldt County, you should really take a tour of Baywood.  You won't be disappointed!<//review>

I would love to rate you 0 stars as my boyfriend finally got a chance to go play on your esteemed Golf Course only to turn his back for five minutes while on practice green!! (Couldnt even make it to the main course)  to have his red novelty Scotty Cameron putter cover stolen off the ground where his items were clearly laid. He calmly asked two older people (Alumni) walking your course if they or someone else had seen it. The response was that if he asked one more time for his items your pro manager would take care of him. If you allow elderly to stomp on your grass as if manners and human decency trumps being polite. My heart aches and your business will fail. We as a new generation on the course as well deserves respect.  I BOUGHT HIM THAT FOR HIS BIRTHDAY IN MARCH. To just steal from someone who was out there just trying to have a good day KNOWING DAM WELL you have no idea what this person is going through! yet you decided to take what was not yours I will be getting everything back as you have a list of memebers and i plan on speaking with you directly.< /Text>

we showed up right when they opened and they were happy to serve us. they have a pretty big menu and a lot of options including food as well. their customer service was welcoming and nice. although i don't have children i think it's cool they have a small section for kids. i would like to return after CoViD times and enjoy sipping coffee inside next to the plants they have for sale.<//text>

A couple vegan options are available,  as well as traditional food items such as a great brioche bacon bfast sandwich.  little slower due to covid,  but worth the wait to help keep the small delicious spots open.</review><time>1613757109945< /time><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

Lovely little coffee shop for the hipster crowd.  They literally serve avocado toast here and it tastes amazing.  Their coffee is made well and there is a great variety of cold brews to choose from.  The decor in the cafe is very trendy and there are outlets at most of the tables so that you can plug in your laptop and complete the vibe of this cafe.  Service was friendly and we had a great experience here.  Will definitely be back.</Review>

<review>This is such a unique vibe and a nice low key place to relax, either on your own or with a couple of friends, or focus and get some quality work or study done. There is usually plenty of seating options depending on what you're looking for. One of my favorite spots for really good avocado toast and lots of variety when it comes to selection of drinks. I've been a few times and the menu changes up slightly which is nice to keep the food options fresh and add some variety. Although the location has more a of an industrial feel to it than the typical plaza or strip mall, it’s easy to find by following google maps and there is plenty of parking options. They have a play area and activities for parents who want to relax while spending some time with their kids and the clientele that comes here seems to be cognizant of not making too much noise. Service is always great! They’re polite and helpful with any questions. Service is pretty quick considering everything is made from scratch. If you want a coffee shop with a bit of a twist and a menu that’s not like the brand names, highly recommend you try the Dirty Penguin.<//review>< UserId.>

Everything about this place is amazing!

From the customer service, to the drinks and appetizers, to the design/decor, and the vibe of the people.

Staff/Service: 10/10, very friendly & accommodating

Drinks: I've drink most of their drinks and its definitely a 10/10  obviously this is based on my preferences.

Pricing: it's at market pricing within the local coffee shops obviously not your $1.00 gas coffee price but mediocre.

Even the owner is very nice and friendly.

Come here with my friends on the regular basis.<//review>

Fabulous place in every single aspect:

1. Fantastic coffee. My oat milk latte was well balanced & super delicious, my husband enjoyed his oat milk cortado and almond croissant. We were there in the morning and even came back in the afternoon to repeat our drinks (& almond croissant :)
2. Wonderful ambience. While enjoying our delicious drinks we were happy to chat in a relaxing atmosphere and watch our 9 year old son playing at “The Little Penguin” corner (inside the coffee shop). He loved the board games so much that he didn’t want to leave :)
3. Awesome staff. Their hospitality went far beyond our expectations. They really care about you! We’ll definitely come back again!<//review>

< review>
I've been here about 4-5 times already and I've tried a few items, lattes, cappuccinos, egg salad sandwich, and for my little one some teddy bear toast. Today I tried the vegetable quiche. I haven't been disappointed yet. The food is really good. The quality is there and the presentation is always nice. A big reason why I do come back is because of the play area. It allows me to sit and watch my little one play while I enjoy some nice coffee and brunch. Being a nurse and mom, I do appreciate the fact that I see the play area disinfected through out the day. I also see the have events for kids and story time which I haven't attended yet. Staff is nice and friendly and layout is modern and trendy. You don't have to have kids to like this place. It has a little bit of something for everyone.< /review>

Fantastic!  This is a great coffee shop!  Amazing coffee and espresso drinks and the owners are very cool.  Look at the photo and tell yourself that isn't what you want right now.  100 stars!< /text>

Cool place to have conversations, study alone, do some work. Mini kitchen play area for kids is super unique and thoughtful. So glad this cafe was recommended via Yelp as a hot new spot several years ago.</review>< resp>

This place has a very friendly and easy going vibe. A few moms with kiddos and the rest a mix of people. The coffee was delicious, but the best part is the staff. They are so warm and friendly, and April is a ray of sunshine.</text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

It was a great experience, first of all we walked in and they had a Pearl Jam song which was pretty cool since we are fans. The creme brulee coffee is delicious. We ordered the avocado toast and everything bagel sandwich, very tasty.  The place is kid friendly and very clean. Would definitely be coming back.</text>

Best hidden cafe, lovely atmosphere. The chef is great we always make sure to chat with him when it's not too busy. Bruschetta has the perfect texture. This is the best brunch place. The music selection really ties the food and decor together perfectly. Me and my girlfriend's favorite date spot ;) see you soon.</review>

Worked from here today and it was awesome.

Atmosphere so good I knocked out all my work for the day without even realizing it. They clearly care about customer satisfaction by the samples and overall feeling you get being there. The drinks were way better than most cafes I've been to in LA. Keep it up Dirty Penguin!< /text>

Best coffee shop I've been to! It's a hidden gem in Chino Hills and is super hip. Their drinks are amazing and their space is very beautiful. Best of all, the people that work there are extremely nice and kind, providing superior service. Make sure to visit this place if you're in the area, I highly recommend it!</Text>

It's a bit tricky to find if you aren't familiar with the area, it's behind the Roscoe's. In the building that says Dentist, there's a little pink 🐧.  The staff was suuuuuper helpful and nice. I got the ice coffee and so much better than Starbucks. Definitely coming back< /Text>

First timer...My daughter told me about The Dirty Penguin Coffee Co.,  WHAT KIND OF NAME IS THAT?? The funny fact is that is located across the street from my office!! so I decided to check it out. Great place, Great Coffee, Great Service... and the guy who helped us has a great personality and SUPER DUPER customer service. Am I going back? off course YES!!!!< /text>

<Review>This is the best hidden gem in the city with the best coffee in the county. Not only are their brews amazing but THEY USE STUMPTOWN!!! Also, they have a room for spin class and are working on another secret project in the back room. If you're looking for a local spot where you can meet the owner and have a good conversation I highly recommend this place.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dccd49a4de4cc1:0x5a9a7c4c8858dd43<//gmap_id><Name>Anthony Atticus< /Name>< date>

My fav little coffee shop in Chino Hills! Service is very friendly and warm! Coffee is very good! I have the Vanilla latte with honey and four shots of espresso! Their brunch menu is delicious and a must try!< /Review>

I absolutely Love the new decor and the Little Penguin play area for the kids is so ADORABLE! My 3 children love the little penguin area as well as the little penguin menu items. The avacado toast is by far one of my Favs, and I love the Specialty Lattes!!! 😋Kudos to the New Owner, thank you for making this space cozy for all in the community. Oh and the Storytime on Friday for the kids is AWESOME!!!! Thank you again for all that you are doing!

<Review>Been here several times since moving in the area. Staff is very attentive and have a good variety of coffee. Stumptown coffee is always a great choice. Also have both cold brew and nitro cold brew on tap at reasonable prices!</Review>< user_name>

Totally chill place to enjoy some Stumptown coffee and avocado toast. If I shut my eyes I could have sworn I was back in Portland enjoying some coffee and food. Stop by and check it out.<//Text>

Came because of all of the great reviews and left extremely disappointed. Prices are high and I couldn't finish my chai it wasn't good at all, couldn't finish it. More of a young hipster place to hang out and finish homework than a good place to get coffee.< /Review>

<Text>First time visiting The Dirty Penguin today!  I was on my way home from a meeting, looked up on Yelp to see what was around, and their great 5 star reviews caught my eye.

I can be an annoying customer. I know that. I ask a ton of questions, but the owner and rest of the staff were very friendly and accommodating. I already had two coffees in the morning, so I was suggested a Dirty Palmer, which was excellent!

Next time I go back, I may just order it again. Along w a kombucha.

The place was busy with customers, doing work on their laptops, drinking drinks, chatting... it's a great atmosphere in here!  I love finding places like this and letting people know about shops like Dirty Penguin. My friend saw it on my Snapchat and was excited to say the same good things about the owners and shop!< /Text>< Response>

The Dirty Penguin is the best little kept secret in Chino Hills.  This is what a family owned and loved business should feel like, and this little slice of heaven is more than a business transaction, it is an experience, perfect every time.  Great job Dirty Penguin owners and staff!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

The Dirty Penguin is killing it! They serve Stumptown Coffee (the best roasters EVER). I used to to drive 25 miles to get my Stumptown fix but The Dirty Penguin brings coffee to the a whole new level!
The staff is friendly and attentive to their customer's needs. I love the simplicity of their menu. Nothing crazy, just great coffee. Their WIFI is blazing fast, they have an amazing environment, SUPERB pastries.
Their attentiveness to detail, quality, and service is impossible to beat. Hands down the best coffee shop ever!</review>

Arlene makes the tour amazing. She is so informative, funny, kind and oh so sweet with my 2 kids. It was a cold day, but that didnt stop her in giving us a good tour. Staff is great, and the history is nothing but amazing. 100% recommend<//review>

If you come to Julian , you must go to this place and take the tour of the mine . It is fantastic and facinating to know the history and how they did it. Our tour guide Daniel was worderful!! Super knowledgeable and funny !  It is only $15 per adult and believe me it is worth every penny👍😃</text>

<user_id>105661527201504228063< /user_id><review>We had the tour guide by the name of Daniel AKA Mountain Man.
He is comical in a rough spirited way.

He was very patient with me as I have walking problems.

He tells good stories.

Makes you part of the tour.

Thank you Mountain Man.

The mining company is lucky to have you.

It's a fun trip for the whole family. Not really recommend it to young children. My 4 years old son just wanted to kick dirt for the entire tour. Older children would have a whole lot of fun because you'd walk through the same tunnels the miners worked. The admission fee is totally reasonable and the guide is quite knowledge too. The gift shop also has interesting items for sale. I recommend it for your next trip to Julian.< /Review>

< Review>
Eagle Mine is not only a fun and interesting place to learn about California History, the people running it  couldn’t have been nicer!  We visited yesterday with my 93-year-old Mother.  We were greeted with friendly smiles and treated like honored guests.  One staff member even offered to stay up-top and visit with my mom while my husband and I toured the mine. We didn’t take her up on this, as we have been down the mine before and on this visit just chose to wander around the property and look at all the cool antique mining and farming equipment.  We also enjoyed the gift shop with its collection of unique jewelry, books and doo-dads.  As we left, I felt badly as I realized that we hadn’t actually given the place any business even though they graciously allowed us the use of their very clean restrooms, carried a chair across the grounds specifically for my mom to sit on, took several pictures of us and repeatedly checked to see if we needed any help.  I hope that letting everyone know about this wonderful place and its lovely staff, helps make up for that by bringing The Eagle Mine more visitors.  We will definitely be back and will bring kids, grandkids and friends to experience this tiny step back into California History.  Thank you Eagle Mine for your kindness.
PS – I don’t think I left a review from three years ago when my husband and I toured the mine, but that was a great experience as well.  I highly recommend it!< /Review>

Lovely informative experience for my family. Going into a legit mine 400 ft in a mountain and going out the other side was epic. Fun good mining and actually seeing gold in all our pans but it’s catch and release.<//Text>

I feel like they close early sometimes if there are no more tourists coming in. Anyway Daniel was awesome he's knowledgable and funny. For $10 it's worth it my family enjoyed it, I enjoyed it. There are 3 parts first the introduction and history of gold mining, next is when you can actually try doing it in the water i believe its called gold panning? not sure and lastly when you finally go inside the tunnel it's a walkthrough and it's cold inside no joke.</review>< pics>

<Review>If you take a day trip to julian I highly recommend going here. From start to finish it was about 1 hour. We had the best tour guide, Daniel. He truly made the experience so much more than normal. We had 4 kids in our group. He included them in holding rocks, picking on them to answer questions and filled all of our minds with amazing facts about gold mining and the history behind not only the property but the town of Julian. Every person on the property said hello and goodbye. It really was a great experience for our whole group. We had ages 2-40 and everyone loved it.<//Review>< Pics>

I went up B St. instead of C, turned right and joined C at the Baptist church. I found it an easy hike and thoroughly enjoyable! At the mine I was one on one with "Daniel" until others arrived and he gave me a wonderful talk on mining the gold, silver, and copper from the high mountain. How it was extracted to particulates. I found it fascinating and then we moved on to gold panning which he instructed well and is well versed! When it was my turn . .
well, nevermind! We then moved on to the mine itself and some of the equipment involved in dropping into vertical shafts. About 8 more people had joined at that point and in the mine we went, even going into another shaft and another level of a second mine! It was awesome! We exited out of the second mine. All in all it was a fascinating and magical experience! I highly recommend it. I would go back. I am excited enough to take my friends! Definitely take a child, it's a great exposure to our local history!</Review><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Just visited the Eagle Mine and I have to say it was phenomenal for me and the family. The excitment of going there was fully satisfied. It is worth going out there and seeing this marvelous historical place. The tour guide was very knowledgeable with the mine and its history. He taught us how to pan for Gold and my kids were finding gold pretty quickly. It highly recommend this mine adventure to enrich everyone that visits there knowledge about San Diego but specificaly Julian. All of my expectation were met and will return from time to time. This will be a place that when family visits me I will rush to get them to go. Over all it was an amazing experience and journey. Thank you Julian family and thank you to the workers and guides.

YES THEY ARE OPEN! Great place for a short day trip.  The entire tour is about an hour and offers great fun and some real history of Californias Gold Rush. Great view of the town from the picnic area. The mine itself is nice and cool even during the heat of the day. The staff here is friendly and knowledgeable. The only downside is you don't get to keep the gold in the panning station. But that is the only downside to all of this.<//Review>

Sheer waste of time. The whole tour has nothing but one small tunnel with 1 or 2 machinery. I wonder how come they are still taking so many families inside the closed space during this Covid times. If you are planning to go to Julian don't make a stop here.</Review>

A MUST SEE!  2017 marks the 50th anniversary of the Eagle & High Peak Mines, the mother lode of SoCal. Lovingly preserved by Craig & Paul Nelson, the grandsons of the original miner, for its educational and historic value since 1967. Bargain day trip!!! $10 admission has remained the same for three decades. CASH ONLY.  Professional guided tours, led by a real miner and prospector. Our guide, Matthew, a credentialed geologist whose immense knowledge of geology, Julian's gold mining history, underground operation, and milling process, made a very interesting and .  Tour 1000 feet of underground, hard rock tunnel, and relive the history of the 1870 mine amidst the authentic tools and machinery used.  Steep stairs inside the mine, more than half-way through, so I had to walk back with my real service dog, but the tour was complete enough for me.  My husband continued on and was impressed!  See gold bearing quartz veins, antique vehicles, tools, implements and a huge rock and mineral museum.  Big gift shop in the barn, great for rock hound enthusiasts and beginning collectors. Simulated boot hill. Shaded, pleasant picnic area. Gold panning facilities (gold is recycled for the next visitors, so you can't keep it,) and quick how-to demos. Only six blocks off Julian's Main Street, you can drive or walk in.  Plenty of pea gravel parking, buses okay.  Special arrangements made for geology students (groups), colleges, schools, and film industry.  Clean restrooms. Real (professionally trained) service animals only, allowed inside the mine.  I look forward to my return (loaded picnic basket in tow), to bring my adult kids and grandson for a day of family fun.</text>

Cool little mine excursion. It would be great if they had a video or media showing the mine in operation that you could watch before the tour. My little one enjoyed walking through the mine and gold panning as he has learned about the gold rush this year in school. Our tour guide didn't seem all that interested or knowledgeable though, I think maybe she was filling in for someone else. Several times in the tour she remarked how she didn't remember things or she had weak knowledge of certain aspects of mining. It made the tour less enjoyable. A friendly enthusiastic tour guide would definitely make this a 4 or 5 star stop. It's fun to learn about local/regional history.< /text>

Entering the mine was great and good place to take pictures.
The cost is 10 USD per adult (kids have other costs can't remember)
Basically is a well explained tour inside the mine with great information and at the end you can search for gold in the water and sand stands (don't take what you find)
I was impressed by the mine.< /text>< GmapID>

<review>Wow! It was a wonderful and informative tour.  When you're on the Main Street strip in Julian and locals tell you that you can walk uphill to the Eagle Mining Co., please drive up there, it's not a short hike. We go to Julian all the time but, I've never been on the tour; for $10.00 for adults, $5.00 for children, it's worth every penny. There's a good luck rock wall the Miner's of yesteryear used to rub before their shift; make sure you give it a rub. I got an orb in one of my photos!  Enjoy.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Very interesting place to visit. They have a small store with local gems and jewelry along with some attractions are worth taking a look at. One thing to know is they ONLY TAKE CASH for the walking tour of the mine ($10 for adults).

Definitely recommend Eagle Mining to anyone passing through this area.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQXrkD1ouO7SnngclEVOwUqTgmHFFMOELzTcmL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

So we go up to pick apples in Julian like all the other 50,000 people this weekend and realize all the orchards are closed for u-pick. So we go into a little orchard market named Wynola Flats owned by Mike, our new friend, who tells us to check out this Eagle Mining Company.  I'm thinking "This guy Mike knows a lot about apples, and about honey, so yeah, we'll give him a shot on his gold mine recommendation".  So we drive there, bypassing the hordes of people waiting in line for pies in downtown Julian.  First thing we notice when we get out of the car was the owner inside of the shop waves us in and asks us if we want to go on the tour. Of course we do. So we sign up. Cheap, only $10 each. You can spend more on a Kombucha in Los Angeles for this price. We start our tour and our guide starts taking us on a mystical journey into the realm of 1870s hard-rock gold mining. We learn about the rock crusher, the separation process, and he takes us into the gold mine. This is not your grand-pappys ten cent gold mine. It's the real deal. We got deep into this thing, all the while at each bend learning something new about how these hard-core miner guys mined for gold back in the day. At the end, we even got to pan for gold. REAL GOLD. So I'm acquiring a new hobby and adding "Gold-Panning Pan" on my Christmas list. I learned more in this one-hour tour than my entire elementary school education. Maybe high school as well. And it was only ten dollars. Consider what you can do with ten dollars. Forego that next Kombucha, skip the pie lines in Julian, and head to the Eagle Mining Company. You'll be glad you did!<//text>

Awesome tour with Craig! Panning for gold was really fun. The tour was not rushed at all, nor was it a cookie cutter experience. These guys were raised at the mine and know everything about the history and operation. Really educational and super cool. What can beat a legit gold mine from 1870? Not much. Highly recommend!< /Text>

The tour was thoroughly comfortable and informative, not touristy at all. Guide very knowledgeable. Dusty, authentic, sometimes astonishing paraphernalia was sprinkled throughout from when the mine was in full swing.</text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>Craig gave the best tour ever! The mine is owned by his family and he transferred all the passion for the mine into the tour group. The mine itself is so cool. Everything you'd imagine an old gold mine should be. And it goes through the mountain and spits you out pretty close to where you went in, so you never have to backtrack. They turn the lights off at a certain point and that is always lots of fun. What a cool experience it was to tour a real mine and hear about it from someone who was so passionate about it. Seriously, if you go on this tour - ask for Craig!</Text></record>

Was an enjoyable and educational experience and our tour guide Christie was excellent! We learned how to pan for gold as well as going into the eagle mine and Highpeak mine from the 1870s, was insanely cool! Great prices for group tour and private tours.</review>

He was so excited about everything,  very knowledgeable and sincerely cared about the people. We said our daughters name once and he continued to say her name as he spoke to her. There was a bit of awkwardness when the owner interrupted our tour to keep telling daniel to do things in a different order which seemed weird. The woman at the desk put the groups together and just added us in with the group. But it seems like to improve the experience the staff needs to better communicate.  Thanks again daniel for a great day!</Review><resp>None<//resp>< date>

i came here with low expectations and left quite inpressed for the quality and educative time we spent. particular kudos to our tour guide Matthew since he made the tour interesting with down to earth jokes. highly recommended if you have couple hours to spare while you are in julian. btw make sure you have cash as it is cash only for admission.<//Review>

<Text>NOTE: CASH ONLY
My family and I had a great time. We were short a couple dollars as we didn't know about the cash only policy. The kind gentleman was super kind to just let is go anyways.  We had two your guides, both of whom added to the pleasant memorable experience. The first gentleman who forgave our cashless goof up he is the outside the mine tour where the prices to extract the precious metals from the ore. Very knowledgeable. Duane took us into the mine. I am so grateful for how great he was with my 4 year old, keeping her interested. Great guys. Also I just love the geology that we get to learn first hand and actually run our fingers across.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVvMV9fuq6Uqyq2j2wDaUAj3mvo8bNc8TI5uzY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

Great tour! Friendly guides. Just leave really young kids or those with mobility issues at home—getting through the mine with the uneven floor and up a ladder isn’t easy for everyone.

Bring cash! $10 for 13 and up, $5 for kids as of 1/2020.<//review>

Off season, December, they didn't answer the phone or it was the wrong number, so we almost did not go.  But so glad we went to "check it out" anyways as we were extremely impressed.  Jerry gave the mine tour and was very knowledgeable and well versed, as if he was once a miner himself.  Highly recommend this for the whole family or if you are just going solo.  All three of our little ones enjoyed the experience, especially the panning for gold at the end!< /review>

<name>Melissa Dee</name><Text>In spite of my claustrophobia and fear of the dark, I actually enjoyed the mine tour (beware: it is tight and gets REAL dark in there). The tour guide was knowledgeable and funny and it was absolutely worth the $10. They have panning in front, but don't expect too much- its just a demo, really. However, inside they have a gift shop where you can buy some flakes of gold, gemstones, & jewelry. Parking was tight and the road up was a little bumpy but in general it was a fun way to spend an hour.< /Text><resp>None<//resp><Rate>5< /Rate>< Time>

<Review>Didn't want to do the tour. My daughter just wanted to do the gold panning. We're told 10 dollars. We go to get started and they told us not to take anything we find. I thought if you found something that you could take it. Anyways didn't found anything. Lady told us tour was leaving. Told her we just wanted to do the panning. Said we couldn't do it only the tour. I've already paid for it. So they don't even know what they offer. Then she's on the phone telling someone that only people taking the tour are allowed to park in the parking lot. Not a lot of parking and people having trouble getting out as cars have cars behind them. Would not be coming back.</Review>< GmapID>

Interesting place. The tour guide to use is ROBERT. Robert is the most knowledgeable and passionate person there, he has lived by this mine since he was 4 and he and his dad (a building inspector) knew everything about the goings on of the property through all of the years. One of owners was strange and very money oriented, even pulled out the wads of cash from cash register and proceeded to count it while i was there to pay. It was so awkward with owner there, it ruined my experience unfortunately. I would go back however, if I knew owner would not be there and Robert is. He fact checks everything and takes his time, often lingering past the 1 hr time frame quoted. His humor and passion made all of the difference in this very interesting mine. For Robert a 5+star rating, for the commercialization of a cool part of history by one of the brother/owners, a -1 star.< /text>

This would have been a great tour if the owners would limit the size of the group.  I think we had around 30 people crammed into the mine and I had difficulty hearing parts of it because we were strung out so far.  Our tour guide, Matt, was excellent and gave us a great deal of knowledge on the geology and mining, but our experience was severely hampered by the size of the group.<//Text>

This is a great spot. The owners do a lot to make this work.  I will say, it has changed more recently.  I'm not sure why the museum area has been neglected as it is.  In fact, the word neglect doesn't even go far enough.  They seem to use it as a giant scrap closet now- absolute shame in my opinion.  Visitors have no idea what they are missing out on.  They do not know that their tour has had 15-20 minutes shaved off the original tour.

If you stop in, look to meet Craig.   This man pours his heart and soul into this business.  For him, I doubt he sees a business. I'm sure he sees much more.  I say this because noone would work as hard as he does just for some money.  When I mentioned that I was surprised that the mines weren't dustier, he told us that he walks down the tunnels every day before the tours with buckets of water.  The water helps to hold the dust down.  Now, this man is pushing 50 and stood before us with a cast on his foot.  He had recently broken it.  But his dedication does not allow him to stop. He is dedicated to creating an experience.   He is dedicated to keeping this place alive.  This dedication is something I very much respect.

One last thing, I see others saying they only take cash for the tour.  That is simply not true.  They take cash,PayPal, or check for the tour.  For items in the shop, I believe they will only accept cash.</Text>

<time>1565717334639</time><Rating>5</Rating><text>We visited this gold mine with a group of other tour guides from the San Diego Tour Guide Association. We have many visitors to San Diego on our tours asking us for recommendations on what to do in San Diego. After spending a day sightseeing in Julian, we can now absolutely add this destination to our list of things to do while visiting this mountain community.  It is authentic and educational. But this was more than a history lesson, it was an experience.  You see firsthand the realities of what early miners endured during this historic period of American history.  It was an hour walk in the mine and then there are mining activities outside the mine.  This is not a re-creation of something like a movie set.  This was the real deal.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dbd00e112e4949:0x9efeaa4112383d0d< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Lots of fun and history highly recommended. Only 10.00 bux per adult 8per kid I think? Well worth the money and time. History with a lil bit of gold panning getting to see up close old mining equipment and machinery. Got to talk to the owner learned a lot more about Julian than I knew before. Bring the kids or just get out for the day. They have facilities there parking may be an issue. I'm pretty sure there is other parking available was pretty much full when we arrived just didn't see another lot. If you happen to be in Julian you gotta stop by and take the mine tour. Owner and staff are super friendly and helpful!< /Review>< Pics>

My husband and I took a day trip to Julian today. After spending the morning walking in and out of every single shop, we found ourselves with nothing to do after lunch so we asked our waitress what she suggested and she pointed us towards The Eagle Mining Company. And we are so glad we listened!!
The property is an actual mine from the gold rush! Our tour guide was AWESOME! He was funny and entertaining and SUPER knowledgeable on the mine and the mining culture. The tour lasted an hour and was worth every penny of the $10 ticket!!
I wish I had known that they have picnic tables with umbrellas! Perfect picnic spot!!!<//review>

Today we went for a tour at the Eagle & High Mine as a large homeschooling group. We fully enjoyed it! It was a great hands on educational experience. The Nelson family was awesome at educating the kids on their developmental level about gold mining. Everyone was fully enthralled and was captivated by the history to be learned there. The experience really helps you understand the day and the life of a miner as you walk through the mine. We look forward to returning next year for another gold mining tour.</text>

Being in the mine is amazing.  Super cool.  I'm 6'2 and at the end you have to walk a while hunched over to get out... so that was a bit tough, but worth it.  Ask about the gold that is STILL IN the mine!!!  You can see it at times!< /Text><GmapID>0x80dbd00e112e4949:0x9efeaa4112383d0d< /GmapID></record>

<user_id>113534231040068727078< /user_id><Review>I took this tour today. I got there just before 10 AM hoping to be done by 11 as I had other activities I wanted to do before heading back home. Unfortunately, the tour took a good two hours. I was not prepared for that. It depends on who your tour guide is. I had Craig who supposedly is the owner. He is very long-winded, boringly so in my opinion. He's very knowledgeable and proud of his family history but it would have been more enjoyable for me if he had shortened his spiel considerably. I felt like I was being held hostage inside the mine as well as did others that were in my group. So be forewarned, if you get Craig you're going to be there for a good two hours. I heard that there are other tour guides that are much better. You might want to check to see who your tour guide is going to be before you step into that mine.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Included with the tour is learning the basics of panning through sand to find gold. We went as a family of four.  All of my boys had fun.  My favorite part was touring the Mine.  We will most likely visit again.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

The tour is informative and the guide is excellent.  The mine is well-lit and in good shape.  It is a quarter mile journey through the mountain -- in one side and out the other -- with a bunch of cool things to see and hear about.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

This place is AWESOME! Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and informative. Rather than a Disney-type make believe experience this was the real thing . You not only go deep in the mine which has been virtually untouched for a century, you actually see the tools and remnants of how the miners actually left it. The tour concluded with seeing the original rock crushers and a chance to pan for gold (but they would t let us keep it :-( we met the owner on the way out who walked with us and shared his story of his grandfather who started the mine and how he lives to introduce everyone to mining and this special property.<//review>

The tour states it only goes for an hour, but prepared to be there for 1-3 hours. The guides are great and have first hand experiences in the mine, as it was owned by their family.

This place was the high point of our visit to Julian. I thought it would be the most touristy place, but it turned out to be the least touristy place. The tour is actually of two mines that were run from the 1870s until the depression. Our tour guide was tremendously knowledgeable and oddly passionate about mining. He taught us a lot of things, from the history of this particular place and how it led to Julian’s growth, to the actual mechanics and economics of mining.

We were truly impressed. Plus, it was fun! There was just enough walking to burn some of those calories from eating apple pie and drinking apple cider, but not enough to deter older visitors or people who don’t like walking (although there is one narrow and steep passage that might be tough for older folks).<//Review>

Coming to Julian without touring this mind is a serious loss. Our tour guide was excellent, and they stagger activities so we could jump onto a tour right away. We got to gold pan, take a tour of a mine and a stamp mill all for 10$. What apples?<//Review>

To be honest, I wasn't sure what to expect, but my wife and I really did enjoy our tour this past weekend. The guide was informative, and the entire experience was surprisingly educational.

Only thing I'd "warn" about, is that this is a REAL mine, and isn't terribly comfortable for a tall person to move-around in. You can wack your head pretty easily if you're not careful, and hiking-out the last (fairly long) stretch while hunched-over wasn't comfortable.

Still, I'm glad that they left the tunnels alone, rather than modifying them for tourism. It made the experience all that more authentic!</text>

I came out here primarily to try my hand at panning for gold. Didn't turn out to be a great panner. Others found gold, but it's catch and release. 😟
The gold panning + tour seemed about perfect length at 1.5 hours. Tour guide was very knowledgeable, and kept things moving at a good pace.
The mine, as an experience? Worth the $10 for an adult. If it's hot out? Even better. It's so much cooler inside. It's a great experience. If I was a kid again, I would have dreamed of exploring all the 11 floors of mine shaft!< /Text>

<Text>I wish I could give less than one star. Website said tours were one hour and they were 2 hours. 30 minutes were interesting and 90 minutes were painfully boring. We were in a claustrophobic tunnel and they make you wait there for another group to go, the waiting was uncomfortable because the tunnel was narrow and around only 5 feet tall, your feet WILL hurt.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Our guide in the mine was great, but the greeting staff, store staff and staff educating visitors on "Stamper" were uninviting, cold and seemed to demonstrate a preference for certain customers.  Luckily, we only had to engage with these prickly staff briefly.< /Review>

Really great experience. You can't help but put yourself in the shoes of the miners who worked the very dirt your standing on over 100 years ago.<//Text>

Great tour and the owner and employees were so friendly and accommodating for our dog. Very neat to see the gold panning and inside the mine.< /review>

Our van was badly scraped. With no signage at the lodge, we weren’t sure we had arrived at the right location. We were greeted by an open garage filled with solar panels. Upon entering the front door at 4 pm, check in time, we were surprised that it was a “self-check in” where you call someone to give them your credit card and the keys to the rooms are hanging on the wall. The brochure states “Management is on a quest for excellence” but no one was onsite. Thank goodness we were the first to arrive because later arrivals were told by phone they were overbooked due to booking websites not communicating with each other. These irate guests were sent to other locations. The lodge was beautiful and spacious. Our kids loved it! The community kitchen was huge but not well-equipped for cooking our breakfast. One guest complained about our 9 am family noise in the communal area so I guess the walls are thin. I slept well in my room, but the room had a strange smell like toilet bowl cleaner, perhaps due to some old dried wreaths on the walls or the bathroom that was a partial wall with saloon doors. My extended family complained of owls and raccoons keeping them up all night. One suspected a rat inside the wall. The beds were very comfortable. No complaints there. Morning shower varied from hot to cold and weak to strong water pressure. There was no dish washer detergent to clean the dishes. Refrigerators and microwaves were conveniently located to store our food. WiFi wasn’t working. We were told they were remodeling. Beautiful views looking out from room with private porch. Large deck area with barbeque. Popcorn and oatmeal packets available. Lots of coffee, too, but since we don’t drink it we would have preferred hot chocolate. Loved the fireplaces and quaint furnishings. Lots of wood throughout common area. Poor outdoor lighting when arriving home at night. Needed to use cell phone flashlight. Jordan, the caretaker, did his best to make our stay enjoyable.< /text>< Pictures>

We stopped by to see about setting a group tour, the owners are very pleasant to talk with and appear to be very proud of their family owned business and excited to share the experience with patrons. Looking forward to coming back with both the family and our retreat group to check it out.</text>

(Translated by Google) I will go with the guide for $ 10. Guides are in English only.
They comment in various ways with jokes.

$10でガイドと一緒に回ります。ガイドは英語のみ。

They still roast the best beans in SF! If your a real man and like strong coffee, then you owe it to yourself to try maxs' blend! Starbuckians need not apply! I lived in the City for many years but have moved to other places, and every time I get back, I buy 5 pounds of Max's blend to take home with me.</review>

<rate>3</rate><review>What happened? They closed for what seemed like forever to remodel and when they reopened, they had a breakfast menu, a less cluttered layout with more seating and coffee that was as good, if not better than ever.
They soon ditched the breakfast menu for the usual bagel menu, and the quality/taste of the coffee changed - for the worse. I really preferred this place to the sterile Peet's a block away, but if I can't even get a good cup of coffee....??? I've been back to check on the coffee, but it's still not to my liking (strong and rich).<//review>< pictures>

<text>I really enjoy getting my coffee there. I always get the bagel w/Lox and cream cheese.   Even if it gets crowded it's a nice place to sit down and enjoy breakfast/brunch, and have a chat with a friend.  I have never been there later, so not sure if it gets busier. Service is good and they are fast. The place is very clean, for that I Igave the fifth star.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80858711239f9fcf:0xf7beb93bf430200<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Pretty solid food for the price. Their coffee is nice as well. Loads of places to sit with outlets available. One of my favorite spots to relax on my laptop. Music played over the speakers is not distracting.

Update: They redesigned the cafe! Looks great. Would recommend checking it out. Very clean, but not sterile. Homely, yet modern. Definitely worth a revisit. Food and drink quality are still worth the price. Outlets, WiFi, soft music all give a great atmosphere for a cafe.< /Review>

Whenever I travel I try to visit local coffee shops and this one was great. The coffee was fresh despite being late in the afternoon and the service was very friendly. The space is comfortable and though small inside people seemed to have plenty of space to work or read. The WiFi was good too.</text>

Went here for breakfast which was really tasty. The coffee was better than average although slightly too sour still. They have a good selection of food to choose from, and the waiters and barista were really nice. Good wifi is also a plus!< /Review>

The employees here understand how to cook egg and this place is often open when others aren't.  I also am a fan of the view :)

Don't come here in a hurry as this is a small business that gives out quality at its own pace< /text>

<Text>Coffee is pretty weak, if you need that caffeine kick you're going to need to get a double shot of something. That said, all I was looking for was a place to apply for a job with a comfy place to sit and that's what I got. Nice big windows to look out of/lots of sun, outlets everywhere and 2 large comfy (if a bit suspect looking) couches.<//Text>< date>

I ordered milk and cake. They charge me tax on milk and the red velvet dream cake.

why would they charge me tax on the milk I ordered? It's 2.50 or 2.25 whatever it is.

And I didn't like it.

The middle-aged woman said if I'm not satisfied with the pricing, I can talk to the owner; she said she doesn't care; I said," you are stupid." and she said F*** word to me. Then she started talk in the bad about me.

I'm speechless.</text>

Richmond local "dive cafe". You will see a mix of students, adults, and folks a little rough around the edges. Good coffee. Fresh smoothies, and serviceable food. Price is Right.<//Review>

For all the coffee shops in San Francisco, I am surprised that this one is still operational. We're all a bit spoiled here in the city but not at Royal Ground Coffee. I left feeling like I needed to wash my hands. The staff was nice and friendly but tables were sticky, the smell of mildew was in the air and felt the kitchen area could have been more tidy.</review>

📍2216 Polk St, San Francisco, CA 94109, USA

Walking on the streets of San Francisco's working day will be a little sparse, and the days of September are a bit cold. But the benefits of fewer people and fewer people always feel that it is quiet.

When I walked into the Royal Ground Coffee, I felt that the layout was simple and old, but the waiter was unexpectedly enthusiastic. The whole cup of coffee is not a particularly good feeling, but sitting on a wooden chair outside the coffee shop, watching the surrounding residents come out to walk the dog, the leisurely feeling of walking on the street is really a big feature!

Royal Ground Coffee
📍2216 Polk St, San Francisco, CA 94109, USA

走在旧金山工作日的街道会有点人烟稀少的感觉，9月的天已经有点冷了。但是人少也有人少的好处，总感觉这里很安静。

走进Royal Ground Coffee的时候觉得布置很简单很老旧，但是服务员意外的热情。整杯咖啡也算不上特别好喝的感觉，但是坐在咖啡店外的木质椅子上，看周边居民出来遛狗，走在街道上的闲适感真的是三藩很大的特色了！</Text><pics>None< /pics><gmapID>0x80858711239f9fcf:0xf7beb93bf430200</gmapID><time>1570894549902< /time><Name>MsSophieYan<//Name></record></dataset><record>

It’s perhaps the best Italian food, I’ve had outside of Italy.

The location is nice and different and visually appealing.

The customer service was just fantastic; so friendly, welcoming and informative.

As for the food, just awesome. Simply brilliant.< /Text>< Pictures>

The owners take pride in their craft and the foods quality show this. From the second you walk in the restaurant you will see EXACTLY what I mean. Pick any pasta and you won't be sorry.

This has got to be such a hidden gem. The food is PHENOMENAL.  It's absolutely fresh and the BEST Italian food I've ever had. You can feel the passion these people have for their food. It's amazing.< /review>

Seem to really know the regular office park clientele. Came here because it’s close to the house and looking for a meal for lunch hour. Good pick for sure. Everything was fresh (we were told everything is made fresh daily) definitely seemed that way. Would definitely return, given the opportunity.< /Text>< Response>

Absolutely the best Italian food ever. I had their special, a salmon tortellini and my husband had the lasagna. Both were absolutely amazing. Truly authentic and unlike anything we’ve ever had before. The red Italian wine was delicious and smooth. For dessert an extraordinary tiramisu. This place is a hidden gem.< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>The four owners, Giacomo, Simone, Omar and Simone are hands on and it shows!  Their service is impeccable, but that’s not what’s so great about the place... it’s the food!!  The food is phenomenal.  Giacomo recommended the Rosette pasta, it was a special and not on the menu.  We started with a Caprese salad, and they brought fresh out of the oven, still hot, focaccia bread.  Then another owner served our Rosette pasta... HEAVEN ON A PLATE!!!!!
Seriously every bite was the perfect bite, full of flavor.  It was a little hard to find the sign outside, but Giacomo says a new one is coming.   It is totally worth looking for, you’ll be rewarded with an excellent experience and food.
For homemade pasta, fresh bread and terrific service it is reasonably priced. They practice social distancing and masks are required, until you’re at the table. I can’t wait to go back. I look forward to trying new dishes. I know I will not be disappointed.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I can’t speak highly enough about this restaurant. The staff, food, and atmosphere were all far beyond 5/5. The lasagna looks a little “different” but absolutely delicious, along with everything else we tasted.
I would honestly go back for the service alone, they were so friendly and passionate about the authentic food they have brought to the US! Definitely recommend!< /review>

<review>Thus guys did a fantastic job, Italian cuisine like you cannot find anywhere, atmosphere modern and fantastic staff, I cannot call them server,  because they are entertainers. Simone, Omar, chef Simone ( sorry if I miss others names not intentionally), food is for lovers only, who has critics is because don't  understand their cuisine. Anyway keep doing the good work, I will definitely take and send people when possible.< /review>< user>

<Text>2051 Cucina Italiana is the breath of fresh air that we have been missing in Italian food for a long time.  The atmosphere is just beautiful, light and relaxed.  They have the most authentic Italian food that I’ve had since my trip to Italy.  The staff is top notch!  The food will take you on a trip through Bologna... beautiful meat and cheese plates, pasta dishes that will leave you begging for more. Their bolognese sauce is so rich and light all at the same time. The desserts are the perfect way to end a wonderful meal. They also have pizza, which is awesome and gluten free and vegan options.
This restaurant is a must!  You will not be disappointed!<//Text>< pics>

<username>Ryan Molina</username><Resp>None<//Resp><text>This is a hidden gem.  Not just in Carlsbad, but neighboring areas of San Diego in general.  My fiancee swears it's the closest she's had to being in Italy.  My boss and colleagues couldn't believe such high quality dishes were being served at a deli.  Pasta is made fresh and described in detail by the staff.  The staff are incredibly personable and the service is top notch. A part of me is reluctant to post the review because I love being able to celebrate and savor such a rare find without having to navigate a crowd.  However, with something this good, I feel a fiduciary responsibility to inform others and ensure this place survives and continues to service the area for years to come.  In my posted pictures, be aware that I take an early 11am lunch.  By the time I'm leaving this place is about 65% full around noon time during the week.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFXw9xk1IjeOF9J83XqOsuvnnDW44t1QiArIqi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZ6BAs264_yezbpcJ-6zbB4qzm5tuq5Kp6wmBt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_4EaKeNX5DLUlz4gz-aALJfeRpZFnUV5u2jiu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPL4Ozu-Xzy4sVoV9T2L1hj65eaTiooIqGLd7dd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPU00MbdMioa1wSmJdWK8yNAPMf-1YB7CPgjUNL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKibjlYxeXgRv7OGEKAhj9gnTmMZQWSR0PvMSE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< GmapID>

Sure enough, there was the 2051 Italiana Cocina. I will think of it as “4 Guys from Bologna” restaurant because the founders are just that! Cool story.
I get it, San Diego has a similar climactic feel and who doesn’t want the American Dream.
I had a side salad, their Bologna version of Lasagna and an almond ice cream that he said wasn’t gelato but something similar.
It was all yummy, I was treated like a king, there weren’t lots of people there and the restaurant space was open and modern. I loved it!
I highly recommend you try it!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80dc735d0201b405:0xa09006a20b74a3d0<//GmapID></record>

<Text>I love this place. The staff is the best...

I am in this area about once a month and always come here. The vegeterian foccaca is amazing. As well as the margherita pizza.

I've only had these two thus far but im sure everything else is great.

The indoor and outdoor dining is very nice as well.<//Text>< pics>

<review>Wow! This Restaurant is nothing short of amazing. And authentic Italian restaurant tucked away in Carlsbad. The ambience is beautiful with comfortable indoor and outdoor seating with soft music playing while you enjoy your amazing food. We started our stay with a bottle of Pinot Grigio
and complementary focaccia bread with oil and balsamic. We then ordered the Misto for an appetizer which is an authentic Italian charcuterie board, a must. We then ordered three different pasta dishes to get a taste of everything. We were blown away by all of them and will definitely be coming back. The staff was extremely welcoming and made our stay even better. Bravo!</review>< Time>

My favorite Italian restaurant in downtown LA! There's plenty vegetarian options. The service is great. The unlimited freshly baked bread is delicious and the bonus chili oil to go with the bread is yummy and surprisingly spicy. They validate parking in the structure nearby. They don't take reservations but can get on the Yelp waitlist beforehand which is recommended because the wait can be over an hour at peak times.<//review>

Truly a Hidden Gem! You could work next door to this place and totally miss it. Where else can you find authentic and fresh homemade pasta? Certainly unexpected in an industrial park café. Many fancier Italian restaurants don't live up to this. Yes, the atmosphere is a bit spartan, but it doesn't matter. Here it's about the food and warm friendly service.<//review>

Simple, fresh, delicious.

I was told today (12/20/2019) that they are closed for the next six or seven months, for renovations and expansion.<//Review>

Excellent food with a nice view. Rustiche All'arrabbiata is my favorite, pasta with spicy sausage. They offer pizza and pasta dishes, coffee and dessert (the tenerina is incredible) I am so lucky to work right down the street from here.</review>

<text>This is one of the best places I have eaten at for Italian. Don’t let the small deli look fool you, the food is superb! The Tiramisu was the best I have ever had, excellent. Prices very fair, very fair. If I lived in this area I would eat here 3 times a week... yes, it is that good! Place is a foodies dream! Many homemade options and you won’t be disappointed. Had a pizza. Perfect. Highly recommend 2051 Cafe.<//text>< pics>

<Review>This place is amazing. When I arrived Omar one of the owners greets me and goes through the menu specials of the day and shows me samples of the pasta that gets prepared with each dish. These 2 Italian families moved here from Italy and opened this fantastic restaurant. My dish was made to order and I can say I have had great Italian food in NYC and here in Little Italy in downtown San Diego, but this restaurant 2051 Cafe hands down was the best pasta I have ever eaten. I can’t say enough about this restaurant. Hands on hard working family, friendly helpful owners, pasta like I have never had in my life. The only way I found this place was on Google & Yelp. It shows that friendly service and exceptional food.. people will find you. Thank you 2051 Cafe! See you again very soon. 😎<//Review>< pics>

<text>Why is this place only open from 7-3?! I would eat here for dinner every night (maybe they’re trying to help others, like myself, eat pasta in moderation).

2051 cafe is located in an industrial park serving homemade pasta and specials Monday through Friday.  The staff took the time to explain each of the pastas and I took his recommendation to try the special with mushrooms.

WOW! The pasta was perfectly prepared and the mushrooms and the creamy sauce were a perfect pairing. I took my order to go and it was exactly what I needed. Next time I’m in the area, I will be back.< /text>< Pics>

We went out to find this place and knew it was an unusual location and we were not disappointed. The pasta is amazing and as authentic as one would find in Italy.  The owner , Omar was friendly and you can see how passionate he is to maintain the highest quality.  It’s definitely not a fancy place - more like a food court feeling but the food is for sure what one would find in a more expensive restaurant.  Will definitely be back !</Text>

Delicious fresh pasta, lovely kind owner, super accommodating. A hidden gem for sure. They have yummy vegetarian options for each pasta too, just ask. I had the spinach tortellini with a mushroom cream sauce. The mushrooms were super juicy and delicious. My friend had the lasagna which was also great.< /Text>

<Text>They have a limited menu and the ambience is informal and a bit sparse but the food is very good. The special of the day, tortellini stuffed with spinach in a mushroom cream sauce was spectacular! Wow. My pasta was very good but the salt may have wiped out the morr delicate sage and other flavors from the sausage. I also could not taste the chocolate in the pasta. None the less, the dish was still very good. We also got a salad and split it. The salad was good, the dressings were from a bottle (not bad) but seemed uncharacteristically not hand crafted when you consider the work that went into the pasta dish. I'm looking forward to going back. The menu is not large but based on what we had on our first visit I expect more high quality offerings. The service was informal - order at the counter, sit and wait for your number, pick up at the counter. But the frontman we met was very friendly and seemed to care about their product. I'd recommend finding this place if you want great made on premises pasta.<//Text><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We had handmade authentic pasta and sauce that was absolutely delicious. Open bright cafeteria-style seating. The owner was taking orders and made sure we were happy. It was excellent food. We only had the pasta, and there are other menu options but I'm definitely going back specifically for the pasta because it was decadent and craveworthy! It's in the back side of a commercial building so parking was easy and it wasn't super crowded at lunchtime. Truly a gem!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

This is a brand new restaurant in an industrial park. Once you find it you will be hooked. They have several kinds of homemade pasta with homemade toppings/sauces, sandwiched on focaccia bread, Italian pastries and Coffees. They are open for breakfast and lunch only. We stumbled upon this and were delighted. The owners are Italian and recent immigrants. The restaurant opened last month. We had two their pastas and a pastry which were unlike American Italian restaurants. Really delicious. You should check it out!!!< /Review>

What a hidden gem!!! I lost all hope for North County until I went here. There’s very few places that the owner is there everyday and cooks you the most delicious lunch. Beautiful people that are genuine and authentic. This is real Italian made from scratch and you can taste the love. My wife and I are chefs and Italian and this place is legit. Please go treat yourself to the best lunch and meet the owners and you’ll be hooked I guarantee. Also have a great coffee and dessert. GRAZIA< /text>

If you are looking for a lunch spot near Palomar area then this is the place to go.
The chef and staff here are very friendly and they will customize your food as per needs.
At times they would have garden grown veggies added to your food as well. Which i think is really cool." Veggies straight from the garden"
I really like their Focaccia Vegetarian Sandwich paired with Ginger Beer.

A real Italian café. Amazing people and top food quality. If you want to try a real Italian experience, this is the right place.
Pastries are highly suggested, in particular for an Italian style breakfast with cornetto and cappuccino.< /review>

<Text>I cannot begin to do justice trying to explain how good the food is at 2051 Cafe.  If you love pasta this is the right place to go.  I have been trying different plates and have yet to find something I do not like.  The pasta is made in house!  I have to control myself when eating because I find myself making happy humming sounds when I take a bite.</Text>< GmapID>

“Fantastic” can’t begin to describe the quality of food and service of this cafe. I eat here several times a week, and have never regretted a meal. The crew takes special care in preparing every hand crafted dish and ensuring each patron is treated like a top food critic. If I could give more stars, I would.< /review>

First time eating there today and I'll be back if I'm nearby.  I had homemade fettuccine with porcini mushrooms, a special today.  It was good but seriously under-salted.  After correcting that, I really enjoyed the dish.  The mushrooms were especially tasty.  I wish they had side salads since it's a huge amount of undiluted carbs.  Maybe make the pasta portions a bit smaller and include a little salad?  I saw about half the patrons having entree salads which looked very nice but they were too large for a side dish.  Beyond that, it's all self-serve, very clean, minimal and functional.  Huge amount of space between tables so all is calm and serenity.  Final plus is the friendliness and patience of the staff.  Good feelings here.</Text>

<Review>This nice Italian cafe, tucked away on Palomar airport road has to be one of the nicest places I've ever been. Certainly the best cafe I've been to yet. The cappuccino I was sipping on was very nicely paired with the open air setting of the place. Would definetly reccomend to take a date here< /Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< pictures>

<Text>I just got back from Italy and have been disappointed by Italian food since, but I'm happy to say this was the best pasta I've had since being back in the States!  I felt like I was back in Italy with every bite!  Very friendly service as well!

I highly recommend this gem!</Text>< pictures>

Everything is fresh and delicious and at a great value.  There is not an item on their menu or their specials (I've had them all) that I would not highly recommend.   And the owners and chefs are all very friendly and attentive.</review>

Excellent food in a casual setting right in the business park. The proprietor is unbelievabley nice and they have a great Italian menu: pasta, focaccia sandwiches, desserts. There are also a couple of Foosball tables and a ping pong table so you can work your meal off. Inside and outdoor casual seating.< /review>

<review>Fantastico! A must stop. It reminded us so much of Italy. The staff was so friendly, making our 2-year-old daughter feel right at home. The food is fresh and delicious. My wife and I had custom breakfast sandwiches on the best homemade focaccia bread. We will be back the next time we visit the area.<//review></record>

<Text>We brought my adult nephew here to get a suit for a wedding this weekend and Susana Perry helped us. Tried several suit options and ended up buying 2 suits!! My nephew was fitted head to toe and looked amazing!! We highly recommend Men’s Warehouse in Antioch and speak with Susana!!  FYI, she is highly recommended as other customers came in asking specifically for her and called ahead of time. 5 stars!!!!<//Text>< user_name>

Took my grandson there to find a nice pair of dress pant. They not only had his size but also the fabric he was looking for.  The young man that helped us was great. He did an excellent job with the measurement and loaned him a pair of dress shoes to ensure the measurement was correct. Items in the store are rather pricey, but they have just about everything you need. Good place to go for nice products.< /review>

Just went in to get some new work attire. Was greeted right away by Matt and he great. He was very respectful, helpful, and patient with me. Help me pick out some nice suits and gave me honest opinion on how things looked which I appreciate. He didn’t just say everything looked good. The entire staff was very nice and welcoming. Will definitely return when I need some more. Thanks for the help< /Review>

5 + stars. Went in this past Sunday looking to get a suit. Was initially greeted by a nice young associate who asked what I was looking for. He proceeded to take my measurements. From there Susana took over. Total professional was on top of her game and got me dialed in with 2 suits. She also showed me some business casual attire which I purchased. Wore 1 of the business casual outfits today and had multiple people comment on my outfit. Can't wait to pick up my suits and see how they fit. Susana is A+ will be going back for future fits.< /review>

I don’t usually leave reviews but this has me frustrated as it was my First time going to this place and the lady with an accent is so rude even before I came in I talked to her on the phone and she had an attitude. Horrible customer service won’t ever go back in there.</text>

I choose to keep going to this store over the other locations. The staff is helpful, Peter in particular. He knows the layout of the store and where certain styles and brands are located on the racks, even with my vague descriptions of the brand/style pants or shirt.

The Tailor, Elizabeth, at this store is as good as they come. She added Darts to my work shirts for me before, which I loved. She always gets my Hem jobs perfect on all my pants. And best of all, she is accommodating when I occasionally ask for a Hem job while I wait. So even spur of the moment Hems look great- not to mention that she is willing to do it on the spot (without screwing up her tasks for other customers)

I like the store so much I wrote this review, which Ive never done. Hopefully they read it, because their customer service is appreciated

The other staff seemed fine, but I will ask for Peter when I need to go back, he went above and beyond and made my experience fun and enjoyable.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Didn't appreciate the dry customer service attitude by some old Hispanic /Italian lady. Didn't bother on taking my husband's measurements. Maybe because we we're the only black people inside the store.Was very rude and dismissive. Thought I'd for sure feel like that in Walnut Creek, not Antioch. So because of that I'm telling anyone who needs a suit. Go to this cool spot inside the Sunvalley Mall lower level not to far from the Macy's entrance. Awesome customer service! And my husband walked out of there with a customized vest, bowtie,jacket, and pants all for $270 with alterations...< /text>

<text>Couldn't go inside to order our meal at all. You can only order using their drive thru. The cashier had a pleasant demeanor. Most if our order was correct except my burger. Make a long story short, they re-made my burger and pitched in a couple of cookies for the miss hap. Other than that, really good staff, meal was hot and quick.</text>< pictures>

We appreciate everyone at Carl's Jr, they were extremely polite and helpful. The food was great, hot, and fast. The restaurant was clean orderly and maintained. But perhaps most importantly, they saw that we were truckers and opened the doors for us... I can definitely say McDonald's doesn't do. Thanks you again crew for your help.</Text>

<text>Friendly service. I ordered service favorite and he made a wonderful grilled egg and cheese sandwich that was so good that my mother consumed the whole thing. She allowed me one bit for the review process. Thank you, you have great taste. Thanks mom for the bite.</text><name>Margaret Houston< /name><Rating>5</Rating>< user>

Always a pleasurable experience at this location no matter who is working and quite fast too ...even late at night when everyone gets the munchies at the same time and it ends up being 5 or more cars pulling up at the same time to order. Im always happy to see the polite yet joking night crew guy there. Im very impressed with his ability to multitask and get my order hot fresh and correct< /review>

I love famous stars. I used to come everything and order them when they was 2 for $5 now they want 1 for $10 so I don't really go often<//review>

<text>Half my order was missing and I didn't notice until I drove all the way back home to Lincoln. I tried to call but no one answered the phone so I ended up having to drive all the way back and thank God they gave me a receipt to prove that I paid because many times they don't. Have also had bad service at Carl's Jr. in Lincoln so this seems to be a trend with this restaurant< /text>< Pics>

They have pretty good food and some of the fastest service I've had at Carl's Jr.

Though I have to mention an employee Harrison for his awesome service. Makes us smile every time and a great sense of humor.< /Text>

We are the generation, that wasted very little.
In other countries we are considered very wasteful people. Even the rich does not waste what Americans do.
That said, we enjoy BURGER'S at Carl's Jr. restaurants. My wife's favorite is the western bacon cheese BURGER and my favorite is the super star without cheese.
The service is generally very good to excellent range and BURGER'S are very good for the cost.
All Carl's Jr. Are not the same. We went to another location in Vacaville outlets Area and the service was questionable.
This was our first visit and she seemed occupied with her conversation with other employees. We may have caught her on a bad day? I doubt that we will ever find out because we have no plans to return.< /text></record>

Harrison is the reason we will be returning regularly to this location. His spunk, energy, enthusiasm and humor made our experience at Carl's Jr. One we will not soon forget. To top it off, all of our food was fresh and made accurately.
Harrison, you are awesome! Thank you for making our visit "Perfect!!" Not to mention the money you saved us with your specials deals ;) the world needs more Harrisons<//text>

Carl Jr's sausage, egg and cheese biscuit is by far the best around. Why? Because of the biscuit alone. Good service too. Only negative-interior and bathroom need to be updated.</Text>

I can't stand jalapenos but yet they were all over in my burger because of the guacamole. If I would have known that I would never had ordered it. It is the size of a McDonald's regular hamburger. So disappointing.</review>< pics>

Carl's Jr. has a huge selection of burgers and other misc items. Kind of pricey but well worth it. Give them a try and I think you like it.< /review>

I couldn't decide if I wanted a taco salad or a supreme nachosI ended up with the supreme nachos and the meat and beans were very bland like they were not seasoned it all. even though the manager was absolutely amazing I have to give him five stars he was very helpful and kind but the food just was not on point<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Fast service. Relatively clean inside. Food was a little underwhelming, especially with the tiny sizing on the chicken All-Star meal. Can't go wrong with the simple Spicy Chicken sandwiches though.< /text>

Showed up just shy of closing and I figured I was going to be given the look or attitude because of that but to the contrary the gentleman that helped was courteous, kind and efficient.</text>

Service was fast as expected. If you're in a smaller car you'll be surprised how high the pickup window is at the drive through. Food was good, typical Carl's quality and flavor.< /review>

<text>If I could give this place 0 stars, I would they need to be reported.  Went there today with my mom around 11pm because we were on our way to visit my sister at the hospital and my mom was hungry.She ordered a meal and I only ate a few fries. An hour after eating it I began to get really gassy. Here it is 3am and my mother is vomiting and having diarrhea because of them !! I called, told them what happened and the guy who answered said “idk nothing about that then hangs up” tried again multiple times no answer smh. Guess I need to call the people above them and get them REPORTED!</text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The manager here is so stupid! We asked to void the transaction so we can pay him with a debit card but he said the it will hurt his company to void out transaction and be paid in a different way. I do not think he knows how to void a transactions and wants to just give us $5.00 back, but we want to pay for our food. Not only did he belittle us but he argued with us. I will never go back to this location manager doesn't know what he is doing and very rude! I guess he doesn't think bad reviews will hurt his store, so dumb, need a new manager.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

This particular Carl's Jr sucks. The burgers are dry, the workers are rude and the fries taste like they were recycled and thrown into the greaser for a couple minutes. The Carls Jr off of Stanford Ranch over by the mall is way better. If I am going to shell out 10 plus dollars for a meal, the food shouldn't taste like dry cardboard and the service better be professional.<//Review>
