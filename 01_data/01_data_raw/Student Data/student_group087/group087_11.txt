<text>The absolute BEST customer service I have EVER received from any cell phone store in my entire life thus far! This team in particular consisting of Rajon, Mauricio & the manager William was PHENOMENAL with their customer service skills, professionalism & knowledge of what they were doing. They definitely went the extra mile for me and then some! If I could give my experience ten stars instead of five, I definitely would!</text>< Name>

Though the pandemic has forced us to do and shop differently I would definitely go to the Galleria to take care of my ATT needs. Daniel was safe n practiced recommended safety. This did not stop his excellent customer experience and also anticipated any account needs while I was waiting. He made sure that my account was maximize based on any current ATT promotions and/or discounts!<//text>

<Date>1607585644042< /Date><rating>1< /rating><text>Walked into this store because I needed help to activate a AT&T 5G sim card that was provided to me FREE from the Apple Store when I purchased my Iphone 12 Pro Max.

What’s disappointing is the customer service rep told me “we don’t activate AT&T 5G sim cards that came from the Apple Store” and “you must purchase a sim card from us so we can activate it for you.” (Really now?!! For $25?!! When i have one already!!)

I followed up a question if I can use their landline so I can call AT&T customer service to activate the sim card. Given that I needed my phone to work. But he replied with “Oh, our landlines doesn’t work.” (not even an offering an alternative to help me out).

Really BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.<//text>< pics>

Wonderful AT&T store at the Glendale Galleria. Will and Sean are very professional, courteous, respectful, friendly, and greeted us w smiles as soon as we entered the store.   Will patiently answered all of our questions and made sure we were completely satisfied before leaving.  Sean was very helpful with a issue with our phone and resolved it in a very timely and professional manner.  We will definitely recommend them and their store to everyone. Thank you for making us feel welcome!!!<//Review>

<review>I had never been to this location before but I'm glad I did. I usually go to the location on Brand but happened to be in the mall for some holiday shopping the same day my mom needed to grab a new phone.
William, the store manager that helped us out was fantastic. He explained the promotions clearly and listed out our options for us which made my Mom's decision easy. After, he helped me knock my internet bill significantly and  called in to get me a set up date.
We were also having trouble transferring my mom's old data to her new phone. My mom was hungry and William offered to hold on to the phones to transfer the data for us and come back after we ate to pick up the phone.

They don't make people like William anymore. He really went the extra mile for us.

I will definitely be returning to this location.<//review><gmapID>0x80c2c0f8a8125db7:0xfd07d83edc08c4f7<//gmapID>< pics>

Walked in on Saturday 9/21/2019. I was seeking a printout of a device I purchased at AT&T, just proof that there was no balance on device. Was told that if device was not purchased there they were unable to. It was 15 min. till closing. Found it to be a poor excuse to close the store. The staff that was working that night lacks integrity and customer service skills.</Review>

I had a wonderful experience at AT&T store. I switched my Verizon( a lack of honesty and integrity)  to AT&T and my representative Mauricio Menjivar was not only helpful but he had so much patience with me trying to figure out all my authorization codes from verizon that I could not remember, the switch althought difficult and time consuming was made so pleasant by the great attitude of Mauricio.

Wasn’t easy as we were switching from a Canadian plan over to a usa data plan.

Went in for a specific prepaid plan, the guy took 2 hours to activate it. Came to know he gave me different plan.

<text>I can’t begin to describe the incompetence of the people at this Att store. I went in to set up a corporate account. The “manager” helped the brand new salesperson, but not much. I was promised: I’d pay $125 and $35 for each additional line. When I got the bill it only showed one phone on my corporate account and the plan was from 10 years ago with 450 minutes of phone use per month. I don’t know if the new trainee did this through incompetence or the incompetence of the supervising “manager”.  It took 4 hours of my time to contact ATT and attempt to straighten this out. Finally, after waiting, getting transferred to the wrong department, getting repeatedly hung up on I reached someone who could help. She spent an hour migrating my number to corporate, but I had to pay the full price of the iPhone immediately. She bent over backwards to give me credit for the other phone I purchased that the “manager” said would be free. It turns out my new iPhone 11 was defective and I had to transfer the chip back to my old phone. Apple couldn’t see me until Friday. The people at the ATT store were mocking me. Perhaps I should take both phones back, get my money back and go with Verizon. If somebody is in charge at this Att store I hope they will train employees to set up new accounts properly, provide phones that work, be respectful to customers and provide a seamless transfer.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1570029939869, 'text': "Hi Mark!

McKelle was super helpful and very clear about explaining everything. I was also happy that he called up and checked how the installation appointment went.
When I told him that the installer was late and told us that he couldn't complete the install due to AT&T server issues, McKelle was apologetic and  rescheduled the appointment for a more convenient time.<//Review>

HUGE thank you to the store manager, McKell! You literally saved my boyfriend in one move, by finding him the perfect phone and sending him away with all of the right accessories. My boyfriend had just had his phone stolen, and was so happy with your capacity for understanding the rough spot we were in that night. McKell- Thank you for your immense patience, kindness and professionalism! You set the right tone, and I hope your customers treat you with the same respect. If not, you can refer them to this review... ha! Also- thanks for being so funny!!! The comedy also removed a lot of our stress over our situation... Long story short- Jason loves the phone, we are thankful for you, and hopefully we'll never need to see you about a new phone until it's actually time to buy one, ha!< /text>

Not one star!
I asked the sales guy for a simple troubleshooting question. He pretended to know something but was not knowledgeable.
I was disgusted by him. Salespeople are becoming more low-quality then in previous years, I guess this company is in desperate need because of high employee turnover. Avoid this particular location at all costs.</review>

<review>5 days after I bought a LG V20 from them, the phone suffered from a blown speaker. THEY were ABSOLUTELY UNHELPFUL. To get my phone replaced they directed me to a "service center" in Labrea that no longer exist, then that AT&T (corp) store sent me running again to another store in the Sunset Blvd. Mall. This experience left a bad taste in my mouth...< /review></record>

<review>I just went to buy a chamango and when I pick it up it was like a mango juice mixed with chamoy, it did not look any good or taste good. I told the guy the issue and he just offered my money back without asking what he could do to make it better. They just want to get rid of you and be done with the problem instead of making customers happy. Not coming back.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>* I ordered a Turkey torta and got a lettuce torta, REALLY! Called and asked for the  manager and they would not give me his name and to call back.
*8/3/19 Please make sure to check they charge you right, this has been my third time and I always get charged way to much, I did not catch it last 2 times until I got home, but this time from $11 it was, she wanted to charge me $24 😳 really.  And I said, are you sure, for the special, she smiled and said, ups sorry and gave me the correct amount.  The 3 times I've been here, this happened.
Other than that, the food is good, just price unless you get a combo and not get charged extra 🤦‍♀️
*7/19Very good food and service (but always check your bill and the original price)
And no receipt OMG🤔🙇‍♀️🤷‍♀️<//Review><rate>1</rate>< gmapID>

This place made me realIze that I rather make my own torta and smoothie at home. It’s much cheaper and it will taste better. Their food is horrible. Plus they have some bad customer service. The owner needs to learn proper mannerism with his customers that are bringing him profit. I hope he learns soon before he goes out of business. Start with a proper greeting and a smile. That can go a long way. Plus there are rats in the bathroom.</text>

<Time>1555402154700</Time><review>I've been here 3 times in the last 3 years really trying to give them another shot. (This review is based on my last visit, but it is quite similar to my previous visits. )
Their prices are a bit too high, customer service is non exsistent. I was ignored and told to wait because the male cashier who had reciepts and his phone in hand.
He also seemed quite rude to the rest of the staff.
They took about 40 minutes to prepare a simple order.
When it was time to pick it up, I felt rushed to grab it.
I will say that I do like the idea behind their decor and style. It feels warm and inviting.
I took my order home and shared it with someone else and we both got food poisoning and bad heartburn.< /review>< pics>

4 people working, not that busy, but constant and workers were still being very slow, 1 Roast beef torta & a Smoothie took them 30 min. I Almost arrived late for work, on top of that, on my lunch break couldn't eat the torta because it had some kind of hot sauce or chile or something but it was hot. I specifically asked for that one because I can't eat anything spicy and I ended up having to eat a slim Jim  since I cannot leave on my lunch and I work all the way in Miramar, worst experience ever,< /text>

<review>Workers were  rude didn’t even acknowledge us walking in. No thank you no manners no nothing. If I could give them 0 stars I would. I got a ham torta and smoothie and I regretted eating out in the first place. The torta was all lettuce, they didn’t even toast the bread. Thank you Tropi Frutas for at least making me notice I should just cook for myself at home ALWAYS.< /review></record></dataset><record>

It used to be one of my favorites places to go, to tell you the truth it is very cool place with an extensive menu which is good, but some of the employees are kind of rude, and it is like the fourth time that I get something smelly and nasty in my order.  I think that they should be more carefull when handling food because maybe they don't know but eating bad food can end up in a very very serious injury.<//Text>

Great tasting fresas con crema! Lots of Amazing tortas, raspados, liquados, milkshakes (made with Thrifty ice cream), and other treats like chamangoes & diablitos.

I keep coming back to this place because of the good tasting food and the atmosphere. The walls are lined with reprints of  Pancho Villa and Zapata photos. The drink portions are also very generous so you will definitely recoeved your money's worth.<//review>

I asked if i can have my chacacha on the side i didnt mind an extra cost because by the time get home they are super hard the girl said yes i can charge it extra on the side but cant give it to you on the side. So she wanted to charge me extra but still not give it to me in a small container there was no sense on it . I asked to speak to the manager and she said he was busy and he didnt want to come out .  I said thats fine dont give me anything she just started laughing once I stepped out . They have no type of good customer service .<//Review>< Pics>

Rude rude rude !!!! , first time I went they didn’t care that my order was made incorrectly after I specified what I didn’t want on it. And the girl didn’t even recognize there mistake she just was like “oh ok well you ordered it like that” when that was wrong I specified what I didn’t want on it.  not even could she offer a replacement for a future date because I was home already and don’t live close to this location.  2nd time I went I asked to add to my order when they weren’t even busy and she gave me an extensive amount of time wait to order another item. These girls need to work on their customer service.</text>

I called, they took my order. When I went to pick it up they said that no body had made an order with that name. I doubled checked to see if I had called the right place and in fact I did. They made me drive down there expecting what I had order and I walked out with nothing and when I got out I heard the employees talking smack. Managers need to do some re-hiring asap.</Text>

The combos are well priced, I love the escamochas, however the bread for the sandwich tends to be crunchy and it scrapes the pallet. I always ask them to not toast the bread and they always toast it. The melon was spoiled that cane with my escamochas the last time I visited this place.

The owner(male cashier) is very abrasive with his service. It’s terrible and not welcoming.

The food can be good but if the service is bad everything else is bad.

For future reference, I recommend offering a welcoming smile to your customers.< /review>

The only reason I give it a 1 star is because of their customer service. The food is delicious I can’t complain but the service is way to horrible, In the past I had bad experiences with ur staff they are so rude and they give u attitude when they messed up. Oh my god seriously u need to work on that. So today I camed with my boyfriend, we order 2 lomo tortas a smoothie and a waffle cone . Minutes went by people camed and go and our order wasn’t called out. So we waited and waited and after 25min I stepped in to the front to ask the cashier about our order and she was looking confused and told me it was the next one, so if it was the next one how come 3 mores customers that obviously camed after ours got their food first? 15 min later and they gaved us our food and on top of that there’s was more lettuce than meat on my torta.</text>

Food is good. Recomend Torta de Lomo Especial. I will tell you your order to come out can take up to 40 min with NO ONE in the lobby, even though we called ahead to place the order. They did use to have a really rude cashier she is no longer there that's good. But good is good overall !<//Review>

<Text>worst customer service from the owner himself amazed!... Plus they gave me expired food!

So decided to give it another try today and the owner himself was there and I’m actually shocked he is still running this place check your food I ran into someone that told me he is getting sued for many things food wised just be careful! That’s all I can say Teresitas is a much friendly environment and they keep the kitchen clean as far as I can see!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Worse service in San Ysidro. They make lots of mistakes and don’t even try to fix it. The try to blame very one else but them.

Super long wait time, 20 minutes, ended up with wrong kind fruit in my salad.

I TRY TO SAVE SOME TIME AND INSTRAD OF GOING TO TERISITAS AT PALM AVENUE OFF 805,  RIGHT NEXT TO KFC, U ENDED UP AT THIS PLACE, TOTALLY REGRET IT.

PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE, YOU BETTER OFF DRIVING THE EXTRA 5 MINUTES TO TERESITAS.<//Review>

Snacks and sandwiches are good, lacking customer service skills. Its a bit awkard seeing the owner yell at his workers all the time. Other than that the place is clean, dont ask for modifications on your order...they dont do subtitutions unless you pay $$$</Review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>Service is not great. Times I've gone, the cashier is eiher yelling back and forth with the other employees, distracted by customers or in the back helping prepare stuff. They have gotten my order wrong 90% of the time. I keep coming back because their menu is good-tasting and vast, so I keep giving them chances. You have to be very specific when ordering what you want, because it seems that if you don't, they'll make whatever you ordered, the simplest, fastest way possible, ending up with a product lacking ingredients or not enough of. Since everything is made on the spot, be prepapred to wait 5-15 mins.<//text>< user_name>

Bad customer service. I was placing an order over the phone and I asked for the total of my order and the girl who answered the phone refused to give me the amount. She said “ we are not allowed to give that info over the phone”. I just cancelled my order. This is ridiculous.!!!</text>

Every single time I go the girls have super bad service . Always in a bad mood , they mess up my order and get mad when you ask to correct it . Was willing to pay more for them to fix my order they said no it was my mistake for ordering wrong . I always end up coming back to this spot because the food is good but they really need to work on their customer service . Would give their service a zero star if I could .<//review>

(Translated by Google) It hurts how rich it is, and the quality of the products. THE SERVICE IS LOUD !!! I always have super bad experiences when I order here. They do not pay attention to orders and claims and they are put to you by you to claim.
Zero in customer service. Outside of that it is rich and fresh.

Lastima lo rico que esta, y la calidad de los productos. EL SERVICIO ES PESIMO!!! Siempre tengo super malas experiencias cuando pido aqui. No ponen atención alas ordenes y reclamas y se te ponen al tu por tu a reclamar.

La comida es muy sabrosa la verdad, me gusta mucho comer aquí pero el servicio es pésimo... se entiende que estén muy ocupados porque está muy bueno ahí lo que sirven pero no es excusa para tratar a los clientes como te tratan aquí... marcas por teléfono y te piden que esperes un momento sin siquiera dar chanza de contestar, o en mi experiencia cuando voy a pedir que si porfavor me cambian algo, las muchachas no te hacen buena cara... enserio a veces ni ganas de decir nada por lo mismo pero pues ya estás pagando... lo menos que esperas recibir es por lo que pagaste..

(Translated by Google) Terrible character of the owner or that seems to be, I do not know but if k k never return to that place sr there k be more humble and educated to treat well the clientele it seems or not the CUSTOMER ALWAYS HAS THE REASON and with his haughtiness will not get ahead with your changarrito, I as a business owner never would treat my employees much less badly to my clients, k peace be with you. It's my wishes.

My last experience was quite unpleasant the owner of the place is quite aggressive with his employees and rude with customers which creates a bad atmosphere of the place. The vegetarian sandwich that I ordered had on both sides of the black avocado bread (rusty) which is not appetizing to eat and all the negative comments here I agree, one as a customer is definitely worthless in such situations. I absolutely do not recommend the place.

Pesimo servicio y larga espera en las 3 ocasiones en las que estuve ahi. Mi última experiencia fue bastante desagradable el dueño de el local es bastante agresivo con sus empleados y grosero con los clientes lo cual crea una mala atmósfera de el lugar. El sandwich vegetariano que ordene tenía por ambas partes de el pan aguacate negro (oxidado) lo cual no es apetecible de comer y todos los comentarios negativos aquí les doy la razón, uno como cliente carece de valor definitivamente ante tales situaciones. No les recomiendo absolutamente  el lugar.</text>< date>

<review>(Translated by Google) Very bad service, the woman will thank to order by phone and she waits more than 25 minutes to take away. I do not return here, I go to the competition where they treat me much better and there is less waiting.

(Translated by Google) The truth since you arrive a lousy service ... oy be careful not to pay attention to what you order that if they make a mistake they confront you they do not give the reason to the client apart the girl who attends I did not know her name but she is very thin turns you the eyes and it is haughty .. first and last time that I go to this place and the manager or manager does not know how to lead with simple problems until I take off the water and my water and he made the order again with a very unpleasant attitude 😡😡 😡

(Original)
La verdad desde que llegas un pésimo servicio ... o y cuidado con no fijarte bien en lo que ordenas que si ellos se equivocan te confrontan no le dan la razón al cliente aparte la chica que atiende no supe su nombre pero es muy delgada te voltea los ojos y se pone altanera .. primera y última vez que yo boy a este lugar y el manager o encargado no sabe lidear con problemas simples hasta me quito la escamocha y mi agua y volvió a hacer la orden con una actitud muy desagradable 😡😡😡<//review>

<Text>i have been taking my various cats to Dr. Roper for 16 years. I have always been pleased and secure with his care, opinions, and personal concern. Most recently because Dr. Roper was not available I took my cat to see Dr. Jones, a new member of their vet staff. She was very thorough and took time to answer all my questions. The administrative and tech staff has always been responsive, efficient and courteous. I would recommend this vet practice to anyone who has pets. They are now part of the VCA system and the care has remained personal.</Text><response>{'time': 1620927978943, 'text': 'Laura, we appreciate you sharing your positive comments about your experiences with our team.

< Review>
Dr. Roper and Dr. P are great! I've come here for almost 14 years for all 3 of my fur babies and they were always well taken care of. The doctors and the staff are knowledgeable, kind and helpful and I knew my puppers were in good hands. I never felt rushed and my (sometimes excessive) questions and concerns were always addressed. They are understanding of a limited budget and don't try to oversell unnecessary tests or products. The one way streets to get to the office are kind of a pain, but well worth it for the quality of care received.< /Review>

I have taken most of my pets here to be seen. The staff is courteous and doesn't make you feel bad about anything. They work with you in regards to what they possibly can and provide you the most detailed information. Overall I couldn't be happier knowing they will provide excellent service to both myself and my fur babies.</Review>

Dr. Roper and his team are wonderful.  My 95 lb. terrior (terror), Elvis, is a handful when he visits the clinic (needs a muzzle!).  The staff & Dr.'s here all do a fine job of handling him and giving him the best of care.  Great follow-up as well; they truly care about animals and their well being!</text>

<Text>The team at Bay Park Vet are really professional and I feel comfortable leaving my dog in their hands. They take their time to go over any of my concerns and also provide me with tips and advice on how to take better care of my puppy. They are really professional during this pandemic time and they made the social distancing requirement very painless. Thank you for taking good care of my pup!

We started taking our dog to Bay Park Veterinary Clinic on a close friend's recommendation. I see why she loves this clinic so much. The staff is so kind and caring, the pricing is reasonable, and every time we take our dog, she never wants to leave.<//text>

I was seeing a Movie Jones concerning my cat who had chronic Kidney Disease which had been diagnosed by a prior Veterinarian. monies Jones didn't treat my cat for anemia and prescribed medication that made it worse. The only concern this person has is to Exploit you for your money by doing unnecessary tests and she does not care if your pet will be harmed by what she recommends.Do not take your PET to this person

Very grateful to the Bay Park clinic and team. My dog was sprayed by a skunk and they were able to see us at a moment’s notice, even though we had never been there before. They called to follow up the next day to make sure we were doing okay. Would highly recommend!</Review>

Informed her my cat was coughing for 3 days and now has increased respiratory effort. She told me they didn’t have any availability until next week and did not offer a referral to an emergency hospital or express concern that my cat was experiencing an emergency. Failure to identify a basic emergency could have cost my cat his life. I believe you can improve.</text></record>

Bay park veterinary has taken great  care of our two seniors LB and Ocho for many years, both are 15yrs old but sadly Ocho passed on 8/10. Whenever we needed help they were very responsive and reasonable, not recommending unnecessary tests etc. many times it was just a matter of diet and some medication. These guys rock!< /text>

We are currently going here and have been for a few months with our puppy. We were referred by some friends because it has a military discount but I think I’ve decided it’s entirely too expensive. They have us an estimate for her spay at $800-$1000. Other places told us $95.

Her appointments are always way too expensive even for just a check up and I think we will start looking elsewhere.

When we first brought her in they treated us like we knew nothing about how to raise this puppy and acted very unsure that we would be able to take care of her. We are a younger married couple, both in the military, and are fully capable. Every time we bring her in they say something condescending along the lines of “wow I can’t believe she looks so good” or “wow you’ve kept her eyes really clean” and it’s just getting annoying to be paying all this money to be treated so disrespectfully.

The receptionist is often very snarky as well. When I asked for an estimate to get my dog “fixed” she acted like she didn’t know what I was talking about and then finally said “ohhhh you mean spayed” and it was just unnecessary. She knew that’s what I meant.

Just because you deal with a lot of wealthy people doesn’t mean you need to act like snobs and turn your noses up at people for no reason.

Otherwise a good facility and they treat the animals nicely.</Text>

Bay Park has taken care of our cat Ashey with so much love! She had to have ear surgery and Dr. P explained the procedure that made us feel so comfortable. Laurel was amazing taking care of Ashey the day of surgery. But the entire office staff has always been so friendly and just a pleasure to work with. Thank you Bay Park!< /text>

We bought a puppy in Tj, the owner told us the puppy was 8 weeks and ready to leave little did we know the puppy was only 5 weeks  . Our puppy began having diarrhea for a couple of days , called the clinic and they were able to fit us in same day , the staff and doctors were phenomenal. Explained everything and able to get on our way to recovery. The staff were so helpful and knowledgeable, the doctors made us feel at ease . Definitely going to continue our care with them.</review>

This clinic is the definition of amazing. Dr. Roper and his staff were so wonderful to my puppy. We have been through the ringer with our little man at so many other vets but Bay Park..they went above and beyond to help us out. Dr. Roper is one of the most personable and welcoming vets. He sat on the floor with Dude (our golden retriever) to help make him way more comfortable. This place is what you’ve been looking for. So happy I found them. 10/10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!< /text>

Found this practice 12 or 13 years ago after sampling some other area vets.  Hands down, Dr Roper and Dr. P are amazing.  They have helped us through happy joyful new puppy and kittens to helping us say goodbye to others.  Both Dr.s spend as much time as needed with you and pet and call afterwards to give you any updates on tests, etc.  So glad we found this practice.<//Review>

I would not recommend this clinic to anyone WITH A CAT.

I took my cat to bay park for 4 YEARS, and what I observed was a revolving door of employees. For the first two years the staff that was there seemed great with my cat, and I never had any problems whatsoever, my cat seemed happy and comfortable and the staff never had any problems working on him. I routinely took him in for exams, shots, other injections, even grooming type services... never one problem.

Suddenly once new staff/ vet techs arrived my cat is “so aggressive they refuse to work on him”... I’ve taken him in many times for the same appointments I always have and each time after about 20 mins of my cat being in the back a new vet tech comes out and tells me “your cat is too difficult, there’s nothing we can do, we will refund you your money”....

I find it extremely unlikely that my typically well behaved cat suddenly had a drastic behavioral change for no reason... what I find more likely is one or more of the new employees mishandled him, or their procedures in the employees only area/ back room ( where he is held up for nearly 30 mins every time now) are making him extremely anxious...because every time I am physically in the room with him and he is with a doctor he is fine.

Also I find it really dissapointing and bizarre that the vet techs who supposedly went to school to be able to “work with animals” are so incompetent they can’t give a cat a simple injection, or aren’t compassionate enough to try and comfort the animal and create a calm environment for them.

Lately when I have taken him there most employees are extremely rude to me ( especially a very short vet tech with long black hair and adult braces), even telling me they “don’t like my cat”... not exactly what you want to hear the people say that you’re intrusting with your beloved pet... my theories about these vet techs were confirmed when I scheduled an appointment at my NEW VET... my cat had a full exam and received the injection he was supposed to get at bay park in the back w/ the new vet techs with absolutely zero issues... the problems I had at bay park were clearly due to employee incompetence, plain and simple.

In addition to this, in the past they have given my cat flea medicine that has made him violently ill, and when I was on the phone with the pet hospital and read the operator the medication name and dosage she informed me “that was way too high of a dosage for a cat, particularly a cat his size, and she was very surprised my vet had prescribed it”. Of course I never got to take this issue up with the doctor that prescribed my cat this dosage because of the revolving door of employees: my cat was never able to see the same doctor twice.

Maybe they’re better with dogs I don’t know... but if you have a cat really would not recommend this place, my new vet sees cats only and their staff is very dedicated to creating a calm environment for the animals, and so far my cat has had no issues and the staff love him. We will never go back to bay park again... if the employee incompetence wasn’t enough I don’t feel comfortable bringing my animal to a place where “they don’t like him”.<//review>

The Dr.'s here are easy to work with and give us the best options for treatment but keep affordability in mind. Being AAHA accredited is important to us and it shows that they care about having the best office and services.< /Review>

They take the time to explain options for treatment and discuss things with you. One of my dogs is shy with people and they take the time to let her come to them and not rush her. The only down side is its a little tricky to get to the first time and the parking lot is small but we have always been able to park in the lot.<//review>< Pics>

In 1986 I was referred to Bay Park Pet Clinic (now aka Bay Park Vet Clinic) and have never had any need to look anywhere else.  Over the years  have  helped out friends who needed their pet to go to "their" vet, and after the experience I was able to give them all reasons to try Bay Park instead.  They, too, have all remained loyal clients.

For those of us who consider our pets our fur children, having a stellar veterinarian is as important as the person we select for our own medical care.  It may even be more important, since these kids can't tell us where it hurts.  Somehow, Dr. Roper can communicate with them and always comes back with the right answer.  If treatment is needed, it is priced fairly, administered competently and with much care, and followed up on in a way I wish my MD provided.

As with the other reviews, I feel like the staff are my friends, think the facilities are impressive and spotless, and can not recommend Dr, Roper and Bay Park more wholeheartedly.  It is solely because of their skill and professionalism that each of my fur children have had very long, very health lives.< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>My service dogs & I have been clients of Dr. Ropers for over 20 years.  Needless to say, there have been many trips to Bay Park Clinic.  Dr. Roper is TOPS!!!  The staff is always friendly, greets you by name & is VERY helpful no matter what the needs.
When my service dog was ready to make her final trip to see Dr. Roper, the sincere love & support provided by all, was heart saving for me.  They made the passing as bearable as possible.  It was the same caring compassion, when a year later my deceased husbands service dog had to make the transition.  The personal treatments of these 2 times are very memorable, even today as I write this.
When I received my new service dog—Dr Roper & staff received her into their loving care.  They were very helpful & experienced when I was making plans to vacation in Hawaii.  As a service dog—she did not have to be quarantined, however, the paper work & vaccinations were extensive. This was a several month procedure.  All were done in the proper time frame & to perfection.
Side note: My trip to Bay Park is a 40 mile drive & is well worth it!!!!!!
You cannot go wrong by trusting your pets to Dr. Roper & Bay Park Clinic!!!!!!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>This vet clinic was introduced to me by a friend who has taken their pet to them for years. I've taken my cat and my dog here for a few years. The staff is so friendly, accommodating, and loves (my) animals! I've been very satisfied with the care they've provided to my animals, and I feel safe trusting their advice and suggestions. I reccomend them!< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Dr Roper and Dr P are outstanding. I've never seen vets who were so easy to talk to about my dog and her health. They really make the effort to answer all the questions I had, and even kept me updated with their schedules!
The staff are always good to see and easy to work with. Whenever I go in there they recognize me and my dog instantly and very attentive.</Review>< Pics>

This vet clinic is a little more expensive than some others I've researched, but the care is top notch. They remember me and my dog (even though we only go there a couple times a year), and they take great care of us. I've been to vets in the past that always made me feel like I was doing something wrong when taking care of my dog-- either I wasn't brushing his teeth enough, or I was taking him to the park too much, etc. But, the staff at Bay Park Veterinary Clinic has been reassuring and makes me feel like I am doing a good job caring for my pup. I appreciate their kindness and the attention they give to us!< /review>

<Text>Dr. Roper and his staff at Bay Park Veterinary Clinic have gone out of their way to help me and my diabetic cat, customizing treatment to my personal needs. Their service has been attentive, professional, and humane, reaching far beyond what I could ever have expected. I cannot say enough good things about this clinic and their high ethical standards. As a result, Oscar is well on his way to a longer and more energetic life. I fully recommend them without any hesitation or reservations.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>Amazing vet!  I have been looking for a great vet for the two years we have owned our lab.  She had to have surgery, and Bay Park was recommended to us.  Everything went perfectly and we will continue to drive the extra half hour to go to Bay Park. The office is clean, everyone is friendly and professional, and our dog goes in with her tail wagging.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I've been taking my two dogs care for about a year now and could not be happier! We have had a few emergency scenarios where the vet and vet techs here have stepped up and taking such good care of my fur babies! Everyone on the staff is super nice and they truly love and care for your pet. I would recommend them to anyone who cares about their animal and will never need to find another vet.< /Review>

Dr. Posthumus is very good with his treatment of my
8 yr. cat Noodles.  The staff is wonderful but I
have 3 complaints. The area they are in is great if
You an/or your pet are looking for Marijuana
Dispensaries. Basically they are like urgent care
for animals. They close @ 5PM and their is no
one there. If your animal has further problems they recommend a 24hour emergency hospital.  I have to say that I was there the other day and the visit including blood tests and a bag of food was! $400.
They are very good and Dr.P. is very nice and
knowledgeable but I think they are way overpriced
for the neighborhood they are in.

We have taken our Vizsla to Bay Park since she was a pup. We love it there. They are caring and patient, always keep us informed on what we might need to do for our dog, give us options but are not overly pushy when it comes to treatments or buying additional medications or services.  Our dog had a bit of a hip issue and they gave us options and suggestions and never pushed unnecessary expensive treatments if there were other things to try first, which we appreciated.  We always have a good experience there and the staff are warm and friendly and knowledgeable.<//Review>

The staff are fabulous and extremely caring and gentle. They make you and your pet feel known and precious, and will take the time to really listen, and to talk to you (both).
I have been going to Bay Park Veterinary Clinic for over twenty years, and wouldn't change to another veterinary clinic - despite the fact that I live fifteen minutes away by car.</Review>

I think most vets do a decent job with the routine care of pets. But, what sets Dr Roper apart from all others is that he takes care of the OWNERS, too. I've had to see him on emergencies for either my dog or one of four cats and he always remembered the pets and he always remembered me! I've also had to have him put down a couple of my pets and he is just so darn good about helping me see that I'm making the right choice even though it's really, really difficult. I moved four years ago and drive by countless other offices on my way to his but, of course, it's what I need to do. He really is a one in a million vet and I have all the admiration in the world for him.< /Review>

Don't take your pet here in an emergency! They do testing, x-rays and charge you high prices for that. BUT they don't treat emergency infection!!!  Five hours after picking up my pet I had to bring her to my regular vet as an emergency. She had to be admitted, given injected antibiotics, put into an oxygen tent, given fluids. Second antibiotic given. Requested Bay Park to have records faxed/emailed (5:30pm) to my regular vet, records didn't get to my regular vet!< /Text>

Dr. Roper and his staff are simply the best. I have had nothing but good experiences with Bay Park and would recommend them to anyone. They even managed to squeeze in one of my dogs for a minor emergency, which saved me having to take him to the animal hospital. I won't go anywhere else.</Text>

<date>1520314323783</date><pictures>None< /pictures><review>I took my newly adopted cat to the Bay Park Veterinary Clinic for an examination a few months ago however, nearly three years had passed since I was last there. For some reason or another, guite a few of the old staff - whom I once knew - had left and I heard that Dr.Roper was semi-retired. They also have a new member of their team, Dr. Porterfield.
Dr.Roper, the veterinarian who first opened the clinic - it used to be on Morena Blvd. - has acquired some of the most advanced technological and laboratory equipment available and he has had quite a few decades of medical experience ; the two other veterinarians on their team also have decades of veterinary experience between them.
As veterinary surgeons, their skills are unsurpassed and all are very well known throughout the San Diego area; they have also won a number of awards - over the years - based on their compassion, polished therapeutic skills, and upon their superb treatment of the animals that their caretakers brought to them for examinations and recovery.
The veterinarian with whom I was the most familiar with, was Dr.Roper. He was my veterinarian for many years; another veterinarian, Dr.Humerus has been Dr. Roper's partner for years.
I did use Bay Park Veterinary Hospital one last time, as stated at the beginning of this review but - due to past experiences _ with my the last three of my beloved cats Boris, Cleo and Marguerite - and a cruel family misunderstanding, I'll always believe that I was blamed for things happened that were beyond my control. If I had become successful, I would have opened a small "board and care cat clinic" for people who travelled long distance or just took short trips.
I heard that the Bay Park Veterinary Clinic is now under new management and that it is still one of the best clinics in San Diego, therefore I can only base this review on past experiences, as well as the information that I have amassed by questioning others.
My departure was extremely emotional and chances are, that I may delete it from my Maps reviews in the near future. I also accidentally infused a review of the County of San Diego Animal Shelter - with Bay Park's review, due to a state of unhappiness and confusion : The Animal Shelter must have been desperate to adopt out a cat. I'm not going to tell their story, yet apparently there is a big difference between an employee and a volunteer.
I've been around some of those whom I thought were the best and some of the worst and the only memories that I had left were either stolen or all burned up in a fire. It all reminds me of the social media and those who have "followers."
I have no "followers" and I "follow" no one.<//review><resp>None< /resp><UserId.>115802051008320845898< /UserId.>< user_name>

<Text>We have two English Bulldogs, which are very prone to health issues. We see Dr. P almost every month as something always comes up. Dr. P knows about bulldogs, is able to easily diagnose what is going on, and my dogs are happy and healthy. We really like how he treats our dogs which is why we decided to stay at Bay Park even when we moved further away. He baby-talks with them and they adore him and don't dread going to the vet, they enjoy it! We also really appreciate how Dr. P personally calls us to check up on the dogs 2-3 days after an appointment to see if things are working and how the dogs are.
Beth at the front desk is a wonderwoman and always has a calm, happy attitude even when they are busy.
The clinic itself is modern, always clean, has a Keurig, and you can chat with Rocco the parrot in the lobby while you are waiting. Never had an issue getting an appointment and if they are sick that day they have always gotten us in without a problem same day.</Text>< Date>

Doctor Roper and Doctor Posthumous are the best.  The staff is also very courteous and willing to go the extra mile to help out.  Scooter gives them two paws up!< /review>

Very helpful during all stages of our dogs lives.   We had one put down at the clinic and it was very peaceful.  Great recommendations for flea med's, food, even pet resorts if you need it.

< Review>
Dr Roper and Dr P at Bay Park, as well as ALL THE STAFF, have been an incredible comfort when I need to turn my dog's care over to the professionals. From the most routine of check ups to the hardest appointments, when we're faced with sending our loving animal to doggie heaven, I have been with them for all of it. I've never been disappointed with the stellar care my pets have received. I tell every dog & cat owner that I know that they need to give Bay Park a shot at becoming their #1. I HAVE tried other veterinarians and I feel most comfortable sticking with Bay Park. You should book your next appointment with them and find out for yourself!

Absolutely the Best, they took wonderful care of my babies,and included a recheck in my cats care he had alot of teeth pulled and cleaned and was really sick from his teeth being bad they treated him and he came back two weeks for recheck they didn't charge me for it and that was so helpful because it was so costly to do the procedure I really appreciate them for all they did thank you to the doctors and there staff< /text>

I brought my cat in with an abscess and a fever. I didn't realize how bad she was. This was the first time I'd ever been there and they brought me right into an exam room and helped me with everything. I couldn't ask for a better vet.</review>

Pretty funny how they love asking people to go to jury duty when they have NO means of transport other than by bus yet say that's no problem. This place ain't close by and it can get pretty dangerous in this area! 10/10 will not live in Bakersfield ever again<//text>

<Review>Spoke w/ a gal named Maritza. I am a nurse that is travelling to fight COVID-19 on the east coast. I needed documentation and was told it could take up to two weeks to get it to me. Once I explained that I needed these documents to continue my efforts out here I was helped almost immediately. Situations like this make me proud to have come from this county. Thank you, Maritza and The Kern Superior Court.<//Review>< userid>

<review>The Law Library never answers the phone. Very unprofessional and uncommitted. And there’s only one working elevator. The second elevator has been out of service since God only knows how long. The ladies up on the 3rd floor in the Law Library are helpful but honestly they can put a little more effort into helping people with documents.</review>< pics>

< Review>
Feel the thunder in the sky and the lighting when it strikes,
Flashing light, that's your life, there's no way you can escape.
No more time to wonder why, no more evil paradise,
Fear the light, feel the light, and it's way too late to pray.
Run away, now run go hide, you can run you can try to survive,
But I doubt it so seriously, you stay alive.
Now it's over, and it's time for our lord oh Jehovah to call in his soldiers,
Revealing the revelation and eliminating no Magog.
And there's no time, no time, no time, no time for repenting
And there's no time, no time, no time for you to be tripping,
Think of the murders, people you murder (people you murder)
So may you rest(rest) in (in) peace!

[Chorus:]
And it won't be long, and it won't be long, and it won't before
Babylon (Babylon), the great has fallen (fallen) and the soldiers go marching in. [x2]

[Verse 1:]
We been living in this world so crazy it's got
A whole lot more crazier now
Cause now we're barely making it and dead we can't escape it
So the only way to face it and is all together take it
Frustrated can vanish your mind
When you feel like grabbing that nine
And gotta do some drastic to be with your family
Look I ain't gotta tell that's the living it is that real,
And never really did a thing for us
And never really sat down and explained to us,
That wouldn't be the same for us
And trying to make a living would be dangerous,
Now we're sitting on the block just starving
While we watching all the big dogs balling,
Begin your life again stars starts falling,
So we wait until our God come calling,
Swing low, swing low
Take me away from here please know
That we're living in the last of the last days
And when he comes and he catch you in your bad ways!

[Hook/Chorus:]
And/said it's too late to apologize, too late to apologize, it's too late,
It's way too late to say sorry too late! [x2]

And it won't be long, and it won't be long, and it won't before
Babylon (Babylon), the great has fallen (fallen) and the soldiers go marching in. [x2]

[Verse 2:]
If it's not around the corner, but it will creep up on you,
To get it on up on you
Murder rappers before your eyes and if you can be down to ride,
The middle 187 homicide, truly given apologize.
Too late to pray to God when stars start falling,
Too late to try to interpret the writings on the wall,
It's way too late to pray, too late
Tribulations to great for you to escape... !
It's the end of the world and still ain't got no satisfaction
Living demand, but how I just can't phathom,
But now I'm sick of knowing once you get that ransom (ransom).
And it won't be long, and it won't' be long, and it won't be long before
The world is seeing by the king of the north
And makes great peace, but it's really going to be war (war, war)
Government come tumbling down we never need them no more (more, more)
It's way too late to say sorry too late!

And/said it's too late to apologize, too late to apologize, it's too late,
It's way too late to say sorry too late! [x2]

And it won't be long, and it won't be long, and it won't before
Babylon (Babylon), the great has fallen (fallen) and the soldiers go marching in. [x2]</Review>

Griselda at the Civil Case department gave me the wrong information and accepted my documentation which was the incorrect form. At the hearing in March 19, 2019, the judge did not take that into account and a judgement was entered against me despite the court's mistake. I normally don't say too much in court as I know the odds are high against me getting an impartial hearing, especially here in Kern County.< /Text>

Kern County Judge David Lampe ruled on the side of bigotry and opened the flood gates for the dismantling of Civil Rights. He minimized the protection against discrimination to "accessibility to the marketplace". He took what people had fought and died for and reduced it to a mere perk of capitalism. He ruled that a bakery can use deny service to a gay couple as long as the claim it's against their religion. Now Judge Lampe has made it legal for business to refuse service if they can use religion to justify it. So now a Christian bakery can even deny decorating a cake with the star of David or decorating a cake for a couple that is on their second marriage. Kern County Judge David Lampe side with bigotry today. This decision will be reversed and Judge David Lampe's name will live in infamy.</review>

Best thing at this courthouse is the authentic Mexican food in the basement cafeteria.  I was in trial for a few days last month and the wife and I had lunch there twice and breakfast once.  Best Mexican food in Bakersfield and probably Kern County, at cafeteria prices!  Real chile relleno, with homemade beans and rice.  A puerco (pork) costillas burrito topped with cheese.  Heavenly.  These ladies cook it low and slow.  Breakfast burritos that knock the socks off any roach coach.</Review>

In 2016 we were told that are tickets were combined and the price would go up to pay them off , and now 2yrs later their saying we only played one ticket off n we owe them money and they never tried to contact us or anything and they sent it straight to the tax franchise so now we're getting are Wages garnished. Just cause we didn't know how they work we got f over . They need to change the laws .< /text>

The question people should be asking is where is Jose Benavides  ? Well he isn't at the Kern Superior court anymore due to the lack of respect for a human being in the court room D. He mocks people and belittles and that is against the law. The microphones in the court room are not there to hold you accountable but to monitor the judges. Jose I believe is now over in Shafter and Commanco " spelled incorrectly? is now serving in his place. The courts, The website and everyone that deals with this place is supposed to look after the kids best interest but they can't even do that bc of all the appointments that the Judge, Attorney's have that not just pertain to court but also with appointments they have in their personal life. Laws have been voted in and ignored in court all bc of one law and that law gives the judge the authority to make his own decisions due to the best interest of the children. Kern county itself is completely screwed up from the courts to the police department and by the past this seems to be true.< /text>

"The criminal professional tenant said in front  of the mediator: "She have to pay me to move out, criminals are rewarded"  she was laughing of California justice system, she has been evicted before  ...... I' own a house that I rent to a  GANG ( I didn't know  I run their background but I made an HONEST MISTAKE I should know better, yes, I was naive, yes, I try to help them yes...all my HONEST MISTAKE ) , BUT , it was an HONEST MISTAKE .I work VERY HARD to purchase  and keep my property in Cal City ! ANYWAYS Yesterday I went to this court  and OMG. The landlord tenant law in California is UNLAWFUL it self, it is  almost useless to be a landlord and try to collect any money from criminal professional tenants THE LAW PROTECTS CRIMINALS !!!! Do you understand the gravity of this problem ?? A whole state that has .LAWS to punish the VICTIM and protect the CRIMINALS !!!  Those laws are 100% wrong !!!!   The problem with this court it is not the judiciary or law enforcement the  , the real issue here it is the  LAW !!! Those laws must be changed. The criminals professional tenants I'm referencing here are GENERATIONAL CRIMINALS that work as a GROUP ( like a MAFIA ) Are you kidding me that in The Land of the brave and the free,  our laws protects criminals  ?! Talk about INVERSION OF VALUES !!! I left that court HAPPY TO BE ALIVE !!!!!  I'm giving 5 STARS to the BRAVE mediator Ms. Tina Hopper,  Service 12 Comissioner your Honor Linda Ethiene  ( SORRY  I PROBLABLY MISS SPELLED HER LAST NAME)  and all the BRAVE LAW ENFORCMENT OFFICERS I forgot his name but if theres a good person working there and I witness MANY BRAVE  and HONEST people working unbeliaveble hard to  make justice ( EVEN THOU THE LAW PROTECTS CRIMINALS )  But she is at the 12 service (I'm not good with words or grammar but even an IGNORANT PERSON LIKE ME CAN SEE CLEARLY THAT the CALIFORNIA LAWS for tenant and landlords are PROTECT CRIMINALS !!!!!! )  I lost my case because there's NO WAY for a victim win their case with California tenant and landlord law without spend a FORTUNE. So my 5 starts go to THE PEOPLE I MENTIONED ABOVE FOR RISKING THEIR LIVES EVERY DAY WORKING UNDER SUCH HOSTILE CONDITIONS AND TRYING TO SAVE AND KEEP US ALL ALIVE. Thank you for your service, you know who you are. Whitout people like YOU the world would be gone long ago !!!  NOTE: There was another old landlord  dealing with his professional tenant, and his professional knowing I'm a landlord , she set by me trying to scam me. to right there already, they all know they can play the system, criminals in california do NOT respect the law system and that's why there's so much disrespect towards the police and in other hand that's why some bad cops infiltrate into the system, it is a SWAMP .....</Text>

It's funny how ill informed these people are on cannabis, the reasons for closing shops are based on speculations. Telling the county that people aren't informed about the dangers of driving high while its blasted in the radio drive high get a dui, or that people aren't informed about how much the they are consuming or should be. It's like they've never been in one... Hmmm< /Review>

I was informed that someone had used my name in a petty theft years ago. I went to court for 2 months trying to clear my name. Kept getting told there were more hoops to jump through.
Finally, got a "factual finding of innocence" signed by the judge.
Seemed like a victory. But not only did the courts fail to remove the crime from my record but MERGED me and this other person as ALIASES and now I can't get a job because of this record and was given new charges/arrested over an argument that the cops said normally wouldn't be an arrest but because "the computer" said i had such an extensive criminal record, they thought i deserved to go to jail!
These people are ruining lives and are a threat to society.< /Review>

It has been our experience that Judges, Court Clerks, DA's, and all other employees work together to make it almost impossible to file any type of legal documents. We have seen motions rejected on one day for (not original copy) then refiled the very next day and rejected as (untimely)! Hum yet they accepted the motion at the time of filing! I smell a rat! This system has not changed one bit since Ed Jagels was running the place! A shame! The Judicial System in the State of California is being made to look like a complete "JOKE"! By Kern County Superior Court Judges! They should be in control but instead it has been our experience that most or all are under the DA's thumb! It seems that the Judges have no guts to do the right thing, and follow the letter of the law! Kern County has it's own laws!

All the motions we filed were "Originals" and they acted as if everything was fine when we served them! yet days later when we arrive for the Court Date, we find out after hours of waiting that all the motions were rejected! The Court Date was canceled, but we were never informed! Good Work! The only way for we the People to make a difference is to enact laws to hold this type of actions, accountable as to all involved! Employee's, Judges, DA's ect. But mark my words every Judge, DA's, and Employees would be against any law that would make them accountable! The dirty business of "law in Kern County" continues! It is more than just a shame it is a crime!</Review>

The officers were rude, the people do not give clear directions about tickets and when the doors open. This has been the worst experience I've ever dealt involving trafficking violations. I would give it half a star.<//review>

<review>Al pastor tacos. Street taco size. The meat was juicy and flavorful. I was most impressed with the red salsa. Chile de Arbol salsa can be bitter. This was very good and had a little kick. More Mexican restaurants get de Arbol salsa wrong than right. I would eat here again</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Review>Stopped for quick breakfast, chorizo burrito. I get some Mexican restaurants put beans and rice in breakfast burritos but I felt they had a little too much and took away the main part of the burrito.  Some people like it that way but just wasn't for me.</Review>< Pics>

It was delicious! Ordered tacos and nachos. Huge portions. Made burritos next day out of the leftover chili Verde nachos. 2 meals out of our order. Reheated the 2 tacos leftover. Still delicious! Great bargain!</review>

<text>Very delicious food! I wanted a burrito so I got a carnitas burrito which was a very smooth process and straight forward. I would rate it a 5 but the burrito was a little dry! Would go again if I was in the area though!<//text>< pics>

Absolutely love this place! They have always treated me awesome they have the best tacos and menudo I live super close to them and it's not even a   Convenience why I go there I love there food! You know when they say it's a "whole in the wall" kind of place it really is cause the best food comes from places like that. Every friend and family I have brought there becomes addicted to the food. Love love love them ❤️</Text>

Good, authentic Mexican food at a fair price. For those with a normal appetite, consider *sharing* a burrito. (They're big!) Don't let the "hole in the wall" appearance fool you; this place is good.</text>

<Review>Unfortunately I have to say, the tacos were the worst I ever had! The meat tasted and felt like it was at least a day old.. I really tried, because I was so hungry and looking forward to some, at least decent Mexican food. But after two or three bites I couldn't go on, it was simply to gross..<//Review>< pictures>

Fast friendly service at a great price; we had 4 street tacos, cheese quessdia and 2 cokes for $20 including tip. The drinks were free refills! And, the staff was happy in explaining the recipie for the salsas, and what our future orders should be/try. The Al Pastor  was spiced well, but I became a fan of their carnitas. Its a definite "go to place for a quick bite". Cheers!<//Text>

Didn't order tacos but they looked very good. Came at lunch and it wasn't busy at all. Prices are reasonable, and I believe I would eat here agian if I was wanting Mexican food.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I have been here before but it's been at least over 6 months. I remember now why it's been so long. Unfortunately the carne asada tacos were pretty dry. I had to ask for mild salsa so I could moisten them up. I dont like them greasy but I  this case a little grease would have helped. Had a good portion of meat. Little on the chewy side. But I would rate them a 5 on a 1 to 10 scale. The plate I purchased had beans and rice on it with a small salad. I ate it all. I was hungry and it was ok... I'd go back to try something in a pinch but I will try another place first. The man that took my order was pleasant and curteous<//text>

<response>None</response><Review>Really terrible. The salsa tasted like tomato paste with some chopped onion and cilantro. The chile relleno burrito wasn’t even rolled up and fell apart like a diaper. The fish taco was gamey AF so we opted against eating it. Most “bad” Mexican food is still pretty good but this was really bad. On the positive side: the meal was $14.<//Review>< rate>

The food was decent sized and for a good price. The only downfall was the verde sauce could be tweeked a little. All in all it was a great place and was kept very clean.<//text>

Shame this isn't listed on trip advisor - the food, service and quality were all top notch.  Went in as a family and were smoking happy with the quantity and quality of the food. Nice to support a local business.</review>

< review>
Came to my appointment my wife had set on line for my two boys, was very rudely greeted. Then the lady said I still had two people in front of me. Guess it was just a check in not an appointment. For safety they made me wait outside until our turn was next. After 20 min wait finally it was our turn...after my boys were getting their cut everything went smooth suddenly the ladies were nice. They did a great job with the hair cuts. Boys looked great 👍 . I would have given  a $10 tip each for the hair dressers and given ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ but, they asked for a tip after rudely greeted. 4 stars for now and no tip.<//review>

It was my first time there and I had a great experience.  They're nice, professional and very clean! They forgot to take my temperature and I have to remind them. It would be great if we can all remind them to follow that simple procedure, so we can all be safe. Thank you.< /Review>

< Review>
A lady that cut my husband hair totally messed it up. She had cut off a section on top of his head as well as leaving really long hairs in back of his hair/ear and she didn’t fade the hair good at all worst place to get a hair cut at . I had to go to another place to get it fixed and the person who did it said they did a horrible job at cutting his hair.< /Review>

< Review>
They were very nice.. but man they messed up my hair... Uneven lines, no form whatsoever, blending wasn't even a thing. She blamed it on the product in my hair and said go wash it it'll be okay. Took my mask off and had the weirdest patchy sideburns in history.

For three days now I've gotten ask where did I go so they could make sure never to go there...<//Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I've been using great clips for a while now only because the "salon style" trained stylists typically do a better job with my longer hair on top than barber shops usually do, even though the fades are just satisfactory. However my visit yesterday with Dominik was probably the worst experience I've had at this location. I stressed multiple times that I wanted it to FADE evenly up to my longer hair up top and the guard lines are very visible. I had to try to fix it myself at home. Not to mention how uneven he left my hair up top. He just cut it and didn't double check the length to make sure it was even. If you are detail oriented, definitely do not let Dominik cut your hair.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1580058364714, 'text': "We're sorry to hear this.

Gave my son the exact haircut he wanted. And I really appreciated that the stylist asked me if I approved, not just did what he said. I hate when that happens, it may be his hair but I'm paying for it. Great, quick, friendly service.</text>

<Review>Took both my sons in to get a haircut for school.  No one waiting in line in the store.  They took the first boy and started on him then a family that preregistered online came in and they bumped the second boy for the online registered family effectively splitting my business.  After voicing disagreement with their policy with another customer I was asked to leave and they refused to serve my second son.  He didn't understand why he couldn't get a haircut when he didn't do anything wrong.  Bad policy that I will not have to deal with again.<//Review>< pics>

Brought both of my sons in for a haircut today and I guess it went okay overall. My older son had a girl that usually works in the atwater location and she was super friendly and we love his haircut! My younger son was there to get his very first hair cut and well.. a different girl cut his hair (she has very distinctive BLUE hair) she was a little impatient with him, which I understand it probably isnt fun to cut a babys hair but still. She just did a bit of a lazy job and was trying to get it over with which sucked. The other girl told her to save some of his hair to make the little card that is for his first hair cut but she didnt... my son looks okay, but I will be touching it up and avoiding the stylist with blue hair!!<//Text>

Not sure if it's under new management, but it's much much better now than it was a year or so ago.  I have been back several times and the cut, service and banter have all been great.<//text>

It was as if the person that cut my hair wore a blindfolde and went to work. I will never go back to this place. Not for their $6.99 haircut offer I got in the mail, not even if it was free.< /Text>

I had been on the market to upgrade my HVAC for sometime but couldn't seemed to find a company that seemed trustworthy and with reasonable prices. I was browsing through Yelp and came across Acosta I called spoke to Yvette she was very knowledgeable and kind she was able to have someone come and look at my system the same day! I then met Danny he was so awesome well dressed and professional I express to him my concerns and my budget he then proceeded to show me my options he made sure I was aware of the system I was getting. He stayed within my budget and I was sold! My system was installed with in a week the crew was so professional and clean will definitely recommend to everyone! Thank you Acosta!<//Text>

Had a issue whereas my compressor wouldn't go on. Called Acosta and they sent out a technician, who found the problem and fixed it. They are great for that and I would recommend them to anybody. The owner (Jessie) actually came to my house one time and fixed a issue at no cost.
I offered to pay him and he said it was free, "because we want our customers to be safe."< /Text>

Before we sold our house we had to update the heating system. The heater was in an awkward place and no other companies would even try to work on it. But Acosta did it no problem, and at a reasonable price. They were also very accommodating with the payment plan.<//Review>

<review>Acosta HVAC was recommended to me by several friends whose families are in the construction business. Jesse gave me a very fair and honest estimate, no shady shortcuts or scare tactics to inflate the cost (yeah, other companies tried that). I talked to assorted other HVAC companies for quotes and I am glad I chose Acosta.The crew from Acosta was very competent and efficient with the installation of the new furnace, AC, and replacement vents. Getting the work done by Acosta was a very satisfying and positive experience, THANK YOU Acosta HVAC!</review><Time>1619028222689<//Time>< Gmap_id>

The Acosta team are thorough and easy to work with. I have seen some reviews on here complaining about price. I'm absolutely positive you could probably find somebody to say that they can do anything that Acosta for less money.  And sure, somebody else will probably have a brand new air conditioning unit placed inside of your home. The one thing that you will not be able to get from anyone else is the quality.

Buying the system is only a very small portion of the installation process. The quality and attention to detail of the Acosta team is the best I have ever seen.

To put it in simple terms, it's like if you bought a car with a perfectly running engine but the doors are falling off and the radio doesn't work. You would naturally say that the car is a lemon. The same thing is true with an HVAC system. Just because the furnace and air conditioner function fully doesn't mean the system functions. Jesse and the Acosta team will make sure that you have an entire system that works as well as it possibly could.< /text>

I needed a complete new system to replace a 25 year old system that had asbestos in the ducts
Ramon was the senior technician that came out for a service call and checked everything Acosta even hired the remediation company to remove the asbestos ducts
The crew that came to my home worked so well together it was a pleasure to see and they were respectful of our home
The crew Ramon, Daniel, Umberto, and Luis all were top notch and did a perfect job
I will always recommend them!< /Review>

Acosta Heating and Air Conditioning not only provides a prompt response; their customer service is amazing from the start, and it does not end once they leave. They follow up and check-in on job satisfaction. Not to mention, everyone you deal with from the phone to the technician/electrician who comes to the house has a pleasant and serving attitude. I HIGHLY recommend you try Acosta Heating and Air Conditioning for any of your heating and cooling needs..you'll get both excellent work and service!!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<review>Very misleading we were quoted $75 to perform a check-up the AC unit prior to the approaching summer. The priced doubled evidently AC/Heater are two separate charges totaling $152. The technician hooked up gauges to AC unit in my absence before I had arrived. I am the home owner and this is my rental property. He indicated to my renters that the freon was low and the AC needed $240 of freon. He told my renter that it would be an additional $95 if he had to come back and I needed to make a decision. I was in route from Los Angels only 10 mins away. This company was servicing my other neighbors' home as well so why couldn't he wait? When I arrived I asked him if there was possibly a leak thinking how did my relatively new AC unit lose freon? He advised me that he was not qualified to find a leak he just wanted to install $240 of freon. My AC unit is only 5 years old it has been working great for 5 years now. This very unprofessional technician said "well maybe the guy who installed your unit didn't put enough freon in to save on his install cost" Hum... well even if that was true it's VERY unprofessional to talk to customers like this. I lost my confidence in this company at that moment. My AC unit has a 10 year warranty if has a leak it should be covered. Also it's cooling the home without issues especially a couple of weeks ago during a heat wave. To sum it up I have yet to receive a final invoice with their report of findings listed so I can submit to the company that installed the unit. My stand-in handyman, other neighbor actually booked the appointment and got them started he too had his AC service (he lives down the street there was 3 of us all quoted the same $75 for a maintenance call) To add insult to injury this company went behind my back today and received payment from my handyman since he booked the appointment. Yesterday I emailed Mr. Jesse Acosta myself included my contact info for the billing and expressed my dissatisfaction. My bill has been paid but I have yet to receive a final invoice with the report of findings.</review>< userid>

<Text>I have lived in WoodRanch for over 25 years, and have used Jesse and his team at Acosta Heating and Air-conditioning the entire time.  He replaced my air-conditioning unit and continues to maintain my furnace, AC, and Water Heater.  Recently he installed several Fans in my bathroom, a dehumidifier, and my thermostat, all installed expertly.  Additionally, you will enjoy talking to not only a professional, but also a very nice person who will listen to your needs, offer you a very fair price, and install the necessary equipment.  Highly recommend you call Jesse and tell him I sent you!  Thank you.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><user_id>100512272814726000967<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

Truly a genuinely amazing human. I feel so lucky to have met Jesse - very skilled and seasoned in this business. Super generous with his time too. A natural educator - breaks down information in a way that is easy to understand. And he enjoys the process!! Again, I feel so lucky to have found him. :)</Review>

Highly recommend Jesse and Acosta HVAC. Fairly priced, great service.  The personal touch Jesse provides is great.  He shows up at the inception of the job and checks in on the progress.  He set up a time to come by and made sure I understood everything s few days after installation.  The workers were great as well.  When they left the first day they left the house cleaner than when they got there.  They showed up on time and worked hard all day.  They were also super friendly.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Jesse to anyone.  They do the little things that make experiences like this easy<//Text>

<Review>Jesse Acosta and his crew did a wonderful job on installing new vents in the attic and putting in a new heater and air conditioner.  Jesse came up with ideas that the other companies that I interviewed never even thought of.   He came over several times to make sure the job was done well and even crawled up in the attic himself to make the final adjustments.  The price was good, and the house is nice and warm.<//Review><gmapID>0x80e83097783cda15:0x3263f019ffb368b6</gmapID><Resp>{'time': 1549570504611, 'text': 'Thank you so much Jan for taking the time to share your experience with Acosta Heating and Air Conditioning.

<Review>The technician was timely, courteous, knowledgeable and clean.  Wore booties in the house, cleaned up after himself and was well prepared for the services he provided.  We purchased our Trane unit several years ago and Jesse and his team have keep it running well with annual servicing at a reasonable price.

I’ve recommended Jesse to three of my neighbors and they all installed Trane heating and air conditioning units. So when you ask would I recommend Acosta Heating and Air Conditioning, I have and will continue to do so.  Great crew, great service, give them a try, you will be satisfied.</Review><Time>1548858120679</Time>< userid>

The Acosta heating company did a great job in completely rebuilding our air and heating system, fixing a number of issues left by the original builders. They installed a dual level system that works great. Jesse and Ramon have always been easy to work with, quickly respond to calls and as we had one small problem, quickly came back to make the adjustments. We are very satisfied with their work and would recommend.</Text>

I called Acosta Heating and Air conditioning, Inc, in Thousand Oaks, CA, and I was very impressed by the attention to detail, knowledge, and customer service they provided. Jesse, the owner, visited our home in Simi Valley and carefully inspected our air conditioner and central heating and air unit. He answered all my questions and was very honest with his assessment.  The bottom line we needed to replace the unit, coil and lines, and Jesse provided us with the best options for our needs at a reasonable price.  I never felt he pushed us into anything we didn't need. Nor did he try to add cost to the project. Acosta finished the project on time and with no hassles. The work was top notch.  I am extremely satisfied with Acosta Heating and Air Conditioning and would highly recommend to anyone in need of service or installation.<//Text>

Acosta had the most thorough quoting process and the price was good. Jesse seemed most knowledgeable of all the companies that bid my job. I never had the sense I was talking to a salesman.  I had 6 yr old furnaces. He explained SEERs, so that I could evaluate the cost/payback, and I agreed with Jesse that replacing furnaces now, to get more efficient air conditioning was probably not cost effective for me. He was a strong advocate for permitting the job to avoid future problems when selling the house someday. This gave me confidence that Jesse is used to doing things right. I was not disappointed. Best of all Jesse is a good communicator. When install issues or options came up he gave me choices. When I had questions he called back quickly. His guys were courteous, clean and on time. A pretty good experience overall.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Review>Jessie patiently explained the various systems to us before we purchases.  After our contract was signed, Jessie showed up at the scheduled time and his crew worked carefully to protect our white carpetiing.  They completed the installation when scheduled and I am very satisfied with the completed work which included new ducting, heating and A/C.  I would not hesitate to recommend Jessie and Acosta Heating & Air.</Review>< Pictures>

The estimate was presented on the same day as the visit and it was more than fai.  Once I agreed to proceed the work was completed in less than a week.  This was a full house heating/air conditioning job when no system had existed.  I was thrilled.  The owner and all the staff were quick, professional and easy to engage.  My only complaint is that they were supposed to build a small fence around the commpressor and I believe this was forgotten.< /Text>

Have always experienced the best service from Acosta Heating and Air Conditioning.  They installed and have been servicing my unit for over 11 years.  Just a well run company that delivers great service, professional and knows their business.< /Text>

These guys did a wonderful job.  Jesse is extremely knowledgable and came up with a great configuration for my HVAC system.  They did a lovely neat job which included items I had not thought of, like adding an additional service light with easily accessible switch in the crawl space.  They also widened the opening to the crawl space and made a custom door for it.  It's so much easier to get down there now.  He also helped me with my tax rebate information.<//Review>

<Date>1478021875961<//Date><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Glad I called these guys. We had put off having our air condition unit look at as it wasn't working and fear of it needing to be replaced to which we could not afford. I pulled the trigger and called Jesse who came out and after a few moments of going over the unit, he told me it was a simple fuse. Jesse took the time to go over the whole system and show me what to look for in the event I were to find myself in a similar situation down the road. Professional and caring is what I got out of the experience and will call with out hesitation the next time I need help.

The best part about this whole thing is, Jesse didn't charge me a dime.

Thank you Jesse and Acosta air, you guys rock!<//Text>< Pictures>

My mom works at the one in Huntington Park and ahes really hard working and the food is absolutely amazing my favorite are the tacos de birria they are so good but I also like their burritos. If your reading this review when you go with your family you should order tortas they are so good and for the little kids they have a kids menu and everything on it is very good! I love everything about this place :)<//text>

I enjoy the family atmosphere. In fact these people come from where my grandma's family comes, I see some of my family.
Plus the regional Mexican food is great.< /text>

<review>Worse tacos de canasta ever... didn' meet my expectations at all. Besides that, the portion inside the taco is less than half a tablespoon. Highly dont reccomend them. The only side ot comes with is a very watery salsa to add to the taco. Highly sont recommend these tacos.<//review>< Pics>

This place has better tortas ahgadas then chagos ahgadas used to make when that place was good. I've tried the tacos de papa and tacos dorado's de barbacoa. Everything has been very delicious. Don't let the size of this place fool you, the food is tasty!!</Text>

Man their flautas sucked! lol they use corn tortilla instead of flour so they're basically just long taquitos and kind of expensive too tbh... They're tacos dorados de barbacoa are OK I guess. Service is pretty good< /text>

(Translated by Google) Very tasty, however I liked it more the first time I visited it. The drowned cake was delicious and the barbecue tacos were great, however I would have liked a cucumber sauce for the taquitos. The tacos de canasta a bit exaggerated with cabbage and onions hahaha as if they were to give gum. Of course, all this accompanied by the brunette banker. Friendly staff, I recommend it.

(Original)
Muy rico sin embargo me gusto más la primera vez que lo visité. La torta ahogada estaba Rica y los tacos de barbacoa geniales, sin embargo me hubiera gustado una salsa de pepino para los taquitos. Los tacos de canasta un poco exagerados de col y cebollitas jajaja como si fueran a dar chicles. Claro todo esto acompañado de la morenita banquetera. Personal amable, lo recomiendo.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) My barbecue cake is delicious 😋
The only thing I don't agree with is that I ordered 3 orders and they only measured two small spicy sauces.
If I wanted more I had to pay .😷🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️

My torta de babacoa esta delicious 😋
Lo unico que no estoy de acuerdo es q pedi 3 ordenes y solo medieron dos salsitas picosas prqueñas.

<Name>Luis and Jessica Nunez Alvarez< /Name><time>1551075223613< /time><review>(Translated by Google) The cakes and the BBQ tacos were good. The service is terrible I had to wait more than 30 minutes to receive my order when the waitress gave me the order it was incorrect. I asked the waitress if my order was complete. Before I left I made sure and it was when I realized that my order was incomplete, and I had to wait another 5 minutes to get what I needed. The restaurant was not full so I had to wait so long and I had to have been more careful. I definitely do not plan on eating here again, and I do not recommend it.

Yo le pregunté a la mesera si mi orden estaba completa. Antes de irme me aseguré y fue cuando me di cuenta que mi orden estaba incompleta, y tuve que espera otros 5 minutes mas para que me dieran lo que me falta. El restaurante no estaba lleno para que tuviera que esperar tanto tiempo y tenía que haber tenido más cuidado. Definitivamente no pienso volver a comer aquí, y no lo recomiendo.<//review><Rate>1</Rate>< response>

<Review>(Translated by Google) This location is definitely bad, there is no parking. The attention is poor, the service is very slow. There is no menu in sight and they do not provide it, the tables are not completely clean. I have visited the King in El Monte California and the service is totally different as well as the cleanliness and attention. In this location I will not return .... the penis is not worth it.

(Translated by Google) Very bad service and especially a girl who attended me, I bought a drowned cake and quickly charged my card adding commission of almost a dollar without asking me what drink I was going to choose, and then he wanted to order a drink and he said he would The only thing you can offer me is ice water.
Their service was absurd, they should remove that kind of personnel and put a person who is educated.

Muy mal servicio y sobre todo una muchacha que me atendió, compré una torta ahogada y rápido me cobro de la tarjeta sumándole comisión de casi un dólar sin haberme preguntado sobre que bebida iba a elegir, y entonces quería pedir una bebida y me dijo que lo único que puede ofrecerme es un agua con hielo.
Fue absurdo su servicio, deberían quitar a esa clase de personal y poner a  una persona que sea educada.</review>

Fue absurdo su servicio, deberían quitar a esa clase de personal y poner a  una persona que sea educada.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><gmapID>0x80c2c9233308bcf7:0xe5598809e9443e4e<//gmapID>< rating>

(Translated by Google) I do not usually rate restaurants. But this if you ask, Yesterday after driving 3 hours to the airport we went to this restaurant.
We order regular drowned cakes (in size)
Q THEY DID NOT HAVE. We ordered basket tacos. QNO HAD. I ordered a coffee, Q NO TENIAN.Orchata water, I did not TENIAN
ok then the sra q took the orders told me that nomas minitortas had.
I asked for 4, and in half an hour they gave me 2, and I had to get up and ask for the other 2.: /
But there were 2 entries in the gossip.
And they tell me or sorry we forgot.
Tbn reached to hear the call of a client who picked up an order to take, claiming that his horden was wrong: /

Very bad restaurant. I do not recommend it

(Translated by Google) I definitely love this place! The drowned cakes are delicious, just like the ones in Guadalajara Jalisco! The barbecue tacos are also tasty, my daughters love them! It is a pleasure to delight your palate in this place.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Definitely horrible tasteless drowned cakes, which teach them how to make a sauce because it has no flavor, it tastes like water and tasteless, the only thing I liked there were the sweaty potato tacos sold by a lady from a basket, the rest very Bad service, but very good to collect, they do not give napkins, I never return.

(Original)
Definitivamente horribles tortas ahogadas sin sabor, que les enseñen a hacer una salsa porque nada de sabor tiene, sabe a agua y desabrida, lo único que me gustó de allí son los tacos de papa sudados que vende una señora de un canasto, lo demás muy mal servicio, pero muy buenas para cobrar , no dan ni servilletas, jamás vuelvo.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Quick stop for coffee and food while walking through the neighborhood. Really friendly staff. Two cute little side walk tables to enjoy the lives passing by.< /Review>

Good coffee and nice atmosphere. I came at 8am on a weekday so parking was free and sat down to drink my iced coffee and had my croissant. Minus one star for valet parking, but it was a great find in San Francisco  where a good coffee is few and in between.<//Text>

<Text>Interesting spot with Ethiopian coffee. I tried the traditional ethtiopian coffee from the jerbena clay pot. It was interested light flavor but I can’t say I would have it again. There aren’t too many seats but hey make you feel welcome to stay.

They have some juices and a small food menu. If your reason for coming to Fillmore is to try the coffee I think you can skip it but if you’re in the area I suggest giving it a try.< /Text>< username>

Super cool, little “hole in the wall” coffee shop. The owner, Gideon, roasts Ethiopian origin beans in house. He is super friendly and knew just about everyone by name that came in while I was here. This isn’t your super trendy, hipster coffee shop though. If that’s your thing, then go somewhere else. However, if like great coffee, a chill atmosphere, and want a unique experience...check it out!<//Review>

Uber-local roaster with delicious coffees. Try the pour over with one of their freshly roasted coffees. Great service. Highly recommended.< /Review>

<Review>Great place. First time here even though they're located in front of my house. I really like the atmosphere and additionally their coffee and everything is made fresh there. I enjoyed my breakfast and their service is great. No idea why they're not crowded but I like it too. Too many people create a lot of heavy energy. Latte tastes incredible, coffee enthusiasts will notice that. Maybe I'll make it my routine coming here every morning.< /Review><time>1571680977997< /time><GmapID>0x808580bb18783423:0x8e12495e69be03a9<//GmapID><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>The food here is fair for a quick lunch. I've had salads and sandwiches and I've enjoyed them both. Although I feel the salads for the price could be a better serving size. All in all it's a good spot for a quick lunch.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

This place is the best. The coffee was amazing, and the owner was amazing! I came here to buy bags of coffee as christmas gifts and he hooked me up! I wish I lived closer but I think i’m going to come here all the time anyways. Support your local small business today!!</text>

The foul with feta and scrambled eggs was FANTASTIC, we requested that it be served with injera and the proprietor was more than happy to oblige us. The Ethiopian Shai was delightful.</Text>

Tried the spiced tea with the addition of a black tea bag - so glad I did. It was a treat! Everything else our group ordered was delicious as well. The woman who helped us is a warm and lovely person. Nice experience. Thank you!!< /text>

Had the Adis Ababa coffee and a scrumptious fresh spiced lentil fried pastry. The lady behind the counter was pleasant and seemed happy to introduce her delicious coffee to a new customer. This coffee is worth a side trip, and the atmosphere is quiet and tidy.</Review>

<Review>The owners are very friendly and professional, not to mention the coffee is quite delicious. This is my place to buy roasted whole bean and the Harrar has to be my favorite. The place is very clean and well lit and has a comfortable setting. Bottom line, if you want a wonderful cup of coffee and your in the neighborhood, I believe you will find this place a delight and far much better than the commercial coffee shops we're use to.< /Review>< Rate>

What an experience!! Coffee lovers, want to try something different ? Order the traditional Ethiopian clay pot!! It takes 10 minutes to prepare so don't be rushed, and it's meant to be enjoyed there, not on the go. The coffee itself was great but the experience made it overall amazing.

We were served by the most lovely lady, who was extremely hospitable, friendly and knowledgeable. She told us stories of how traditionally Ethiopians would prepare coffee, it was so fascinating as it's quick different than how we do it.

Ethiopian coffee beans are amongst my favorite type of coffee beans as the flavors and intensity are my preferred. Can you relate?

Great ambiance and quiet spot to read or to get some work done. I would definitely recommend this spot to try either the Ethiopian clay pot coffee or their Ethiopian shai tea.< /review>

I'm interested in trying their "Traditional Ethopian Coffee" -- it's a shared stone pot of freshly roasted coffee w/ individual cups and some snacks. Maybe next time!</text><gmap_id>0x808580bb18783423:0x8e12495e69be03a9< /gmap_id>< Pictures>

Cute little coffee shop on Fillmore. It's my go to spot to get a coffee, breakfast and sit down with my laptop and work. Typically it's pretty quite with plenty of space and free wifi. Staff is always friendly and providing casual and authentic banter.<//Text>

I stopped in for a quick coffee. Had one of the best cafe au lait I've had in a long time and plan to go back for more. Fair trade, roast their own coffee, offers organic food (breakfast)<//Text>

< review>
At Zo11 it all starts with the charming, friendly owner. She kindly explained how they make traditional Ethiopian coffee on the stove in a clay pot. The beautiful and tall clay pot has a handle and is delivered to your table on a wooden platter with brown sugar and cream, which are optional, and a tiny basket of cardamom popcorn, which is not - so yummy. It takes about 10 minutes to brew, which is worth it for a "coffee experience" beyond the capacity of any Starbucks. I think it was $6.50 for the small clay pot and $9.50 for a large. They also have Turkish coffee and your typical express drinks.

It's a great place to chill. Zo11 plays great music. With the tall windows, it's a nice and bright, art-filled space with 5 two-tops and a tall four-top. Free Wi-Fi too! I wish there was a place like this in my neighborhood. I have nothing against hipster cafes, but this place has a sweetness to it.< /review>

This was my first time trying mead and I enjoyed it quite a bit! Most of their flavors taste and feel very similar to wine or some like sour beer. I mention this because it sounds like it’s distinct from other meaderies.

My only knock is that there’s no food available, which probably contributed to us not ordering more mead. Even a free popcorn machine or bowl of pretzels would go a long way.

All in, worth a visit to try something different!<//text>

<text>Their mead gotten better tasting! I’ve tried them on Julian and at first didn’t like, now after 2 years tried them again this time here, it’s pretty good. But nothing beats east coast mead places. They have good flavors and really making it work. The place is dog friendly. They have a small operation in the back. It’s about $10 for a pour but the alcohol content is stronger.<//text>< Pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><pics>None<//pics><user_id>104045571110138021644</user_id><Text>Came up to check this place out after chatting with the fellow down at the Hillcrest Farmers market the weekend before. We got the flight of four meads and sat in a cozy little corner on the sofa to enjoy them. All of their meads were amazing. I also tried their soda, and I recommend NOT skipping out on that just because its not alcoholic, because as a non-soda drinker I have to say that this soda was incredible. All of their drinks were light and refreshing and very palatable.

The fellow we talked to at the market also makes really cool bee resin jewelry out of honey combs and bees who have passed away (apparently workers only live six weeks, so its cool that he immortalizes them in this fashion). The lady at the tasting room who helped us was Abigail and she was a delight. Their space has a really cozy and eclectic feel, they're clearly a smaller company so it doesn't have the resources that so many big tasting rooms like Kilowatt might have but they took a space and made it feel warm and inviting and chose a lot of cute items to reinforce the theme of bees and pollination. A great space I would love to revisit soon.<//Text>< Name>

Keep an eye out for all of the signs and flags because it might be hard to spot if you're not looking for it. They offer flights too! Dog friendly!</Review>< Response>

< Review>
We stopped by the meadery after finding a groupon deal. The place is located in a strip mall and wasn't sure how it would be, but when you go in, it transforms and takes you to a different setting. It was like being in a garden with bees.  The bee theme is very obvious all through the place. The mead deal was great and we got to taste 8 flavors. The spiced shower mead was absolutely amazing. We bought a bottle to go as well.</Review>

<Time>1531863003954<//Time><rating>5< /rating><Review>We were traveling on the Pacific Coast Highway and wanted to make a stop at this meadery. I do everything I can to support the bees! Got a great Groupon deal and enjoyed 4 tastings. The alcohol content was higher, making the mead dryer and less sweet, but I liked them even better than some cloyingly sweet and heavier meads. Jackie was a great host and tried to see if I can get growlers of my favorite mead to take on the plane back home, but alas, it was not my day. Well, that's a great reason to come back! It's a peaceful space to relax, hang out with friends, check out some local art and play some boardgames if so inclined. It's worth making the trip. GPS will lead you to the general area, but it's tucked in a strip mall looking area,  not much to look at from the outside,  but it's the inside that really matters doesn't It? Enjoy!< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-SowpSbmw_I5GcWgdZB61B15Usdpt8CEkvcaZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtFHdSQBkW19lSmn8dz1UDOIbOlecv8_8z9eNR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEnhBn27vGutCsfj8MlhEyfvJbgOhfJyXF--G7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOE5uiL89n6MHIe2elx0yQ45rk0lpi__osx00X_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOletGZgYwRWLHxhbwklb46U0zW5sMJKEBaGl4m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

The mead they brew is what separates them from the 3 dozen other micro-breweries around town. They tend to favor sours and I don't, so that puts us at odds. The golden standard orange blossom was good albeit dry. However the Primer was the golden nectar I came for. Took a growler home as well. It's a shame they over price the growlers, I bet they could sell so much more if they were reasonably priced (about half of the current price).  Flight of 4 is $12 and that's reasonable. Small growler is $26 ( $6 less for a refill) .
Overall good experience, glad we came to visit.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOLWFK9Iz98CGBmDv4DPVAVZYR5RiAuTSX5rDe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

So I bought 2 bottles of mead and was charged $5 deposit for each and told that i could bring the bottles back for a refund or use in against a future purchase. I went there today Feb 24, 2021 and was going to buy some cans of mead and brought my 2 empty bottles for a refund. Then I'm told that they don't refund the bottles. So I took my bottles with me, left without buying anything and will NEVER be back.<//text>

<text>Great mead and nice place is a little small.  Bathroom was clean and easy to use but there is only one toilet.  Lots of different meads and a variety of sour meads which was new.  Think I still prefer twisted horn but if you don't want to drive to Vista this is a good second choice.  Also they have an alduin<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMqg5_T7boC0DfkNOvQihM_nC63wq2QAI0JT9h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfOmdo17Rx7NinmiPbZvVUt-RFuFozAPFa21tk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVMFOH48PhJa46haLIe9vwIR-GBClDhhzu14aT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvPwVPK4WOqYBMXfMZ6MQiBJxlidNXX9ohANKH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1614301844814, 'text': 'Thank you for the review! 🍻'}<//Response><GmapID>0x80dc71406c9b2fab:0x981f602cc8743674< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

First and foremost all the meads lack the characteristic sweetness that comes from the honey. Second, the meads seem poorly fermented which has caused a strong alcohol flavor that mixes poorly with the carbonation that is infused into every pour. Frankly that carbonation thing is really disappointing for all the meaderies that I've visited in SoCal so far. There is no reason for it as meads are a wine, not a beer. I really just can't deal with this... ugh.< /review>< rating>

Loving this place, the atmosphere and staff are great. Comfy seating.  I just wish they had more mead that I liked... but I am picky. Good prices too! $12 for a flight of 4.< /review>

Golden Coast is the first Mead I've had, and I really loved the taste! I bought a case to share with my friends. I have now been there several times. Cool space and fun people.  See if you can talk to Frank, the founder for some really engaging conversations.<//Text>

<Text>Mead is so good. It is the first known alcoholic beverage and is bas D on honey, not wheat or hops. Golden Coast Mead has an ever-expanding list of flavors of Mead and now they have cheese/nut plates to munch on while drinking their wares. A great relaxing friendly atmosphere just adds to the enjoyment. Definitely try this place out.<//Text><Name>Jan Neff-Sinclair< /Name></record></dataset><record>

Love Golden Coast Mead. Unlike breweries that have to use grain in their "meads," Golden Coast is classified as a winery and can stay true to the Mead process. Honey, water, and yeast creates a delicious drink.<//text>

Who knew that mead could be this delicious?! I've never tasted mead like it. Most of it is sparking, instead of thicker, still and sweet - which is how I have been introduced to mead in the past. Many different varieties are offered, most of which are light and dry tasting like champagne. Some IPA-like options as well as sour options are offered too. Very delicious, and a vote for our planet with every dollar spent. Recommended.<//Review>

<text>I've never been a regular at a bar, but this is not regular drinks, it's mead, and it's incredible!  Their take on mead is my favorite way to drink and I have become a regular not just because of the amazing people that have come together to make this amazing business happen, but because of the amazing product and the love that goes into making it.</text><Gmap_id>0x80dc71406c9b2fab:0x981f602cc8743674< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>For someone who is not a big drinker, I could hang out here all day. The low key vibe makes hanging out easy to do, and the variety of interesting meads, lends itself to everyone getting something they like. I highly recommend the spicy borealis or the yule before it's gone! Chris is awesome!<//Text>< Pictures>

Earthday 2015 Balboa park beer garden - Great Mead!!! Tried the Orange Blossom Sweet and it was great! Almost a top notch champagne! Should have a cork, not a cap. Will buy it when I see it in the store. Serving crew was very knowledgable in the history of Mead and the manufacture of the brew. Great time thanks to them. Thank you guys and gals! Loved it.<//Text>

Excellent selection of meads sourced from local honey made with local water. Their meads are brewed dry, resulting in a low residual sugar content and ABV averaging around 12%.

The decor is good and welcoming, the service was prompt and courteous and their signature meads were, for lack of a better term, different.
I wasn't really a fan of the sour meads with the lactobacillus, even the sour melomel they had.

In short, they had some good meads that can be had anywhere, but their signature meads didn't really suit my palate.<//Review>

very good mead. lots of great, experimental stuff (orange creamsicle, serrano pepper). i've been twice and each time have hung out with Chris, who's super friendly and knowledgeable, and always willing to talk about the mead and answer ALL the questions we might have. i love this place.< /Text>

Love this hospital!!! The staff is amazing and they take me in right away! This is definitely my go to hospital. I took my daughter in and Once i checked her in it was only about 15 minutes until a doctor diagnosed her with a condition she had which was treatable and I couldn’t have been more happier with my experience 🙏🏻</review>

This was not the first time I was there over the last 8 years or so.They continually out perform other local hospitals.  Scheduling, testing and customer service is outstanding. The staff is wonderful and the facilities are very good.  They seem to be very organized.  I will continually request from the ambulatory service to take me there every time.</text>

<pics>None< /pics><review>Unfortunately this is a facility that smiles through their teeth until they actually have to do anything. Recently, I called in to try and see where my family member was and when I asked the hotel operator Sandra if maybe they had another name on file and to maybe look into that instead, she just replied very snarky “I don’t know I’m not the nurse I wouldn’t know” and I had to tell her I was just trying to see if she could look another last name up and again she asks in such a snarky voice “What’s the spelling?”

When I asked for her name she so proudly said it so good job inland valley, you’re proudly sporting a poor hotel operator with no manners. You work in a medical facility, have basic customer service skills or get out of there. You are speaking to people calling in often to find out how a loved one is doing.

On top of that, they never make sure the patient can receive and sign a HIPPA AUTHORIZATION so that you a loved one can get more than just bread crumbs from the nurses. They say one thing but the patient says another, they won’t take the effort to do anything so that you can all get on the same page on what’s going on. They don’t even know if he was discharged, somehow he was there a week ago and now he’s not.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dc8316193101e5:0xbc9ab81f80024168< /Gmap_id><response>{'time': 1621621851012, 'text': 'Hi, Rinni.

I was so impressed with the care! Professionalism and cleanliness of the hospital.
They showed nothing but concerned for my well-being.
Everyone wore mask and had sanitizers available at all times.
The staff from the time I walked in the door was fantastic. I was cared for in such a timely manner.

I was brought in by ambulance and it was probably the worst experience I have ever had. The nurses took me off the gurney from the ambulance, put me in a wheelchair and stuck me out in the emergency room waiting area for several hours. I never saw a doctor, I was having extreme shortness of breath and never saw anyone from respiratory, They took xrays of my chest and did a CT Scan but I never got any of the results. Finally after more than 4 hours waiting I told them I was leaving and I would have another hospital examine me. I started to leave with my IV still in place and the nurse finally offered to take it out. I had her remove it and I left. I would not recommend that hospital to anyone and I am considering contacting my attorney to sue! End result was I had pneumonia and could've died! There is no reason behind their lousy treatment and I am still traumatized over the whole thing.<//Text>

<text>Doctor said my dad had to have surgery. He was not very Happy about it. My father had bad experience in the pass in the Emergency Room. As we enter the Emergency Room the security Officers said I was not allowed to enter the Hospital only the patient. I was worried about my father. The security officer was rude he did not even care to hear what I had to say. I did not know were I had to pick up my father after the surgery or if someone will call me. As I was trying to talk to the security officer. A Female security Officer approached us and She introduced her self. she explained all the Process to me. She gave me the phone number to the Surgery Center. She said not to worry she will take good care of my dad.  After I picked up my Dad  he told me  Security Officer Angie took me to the Laboratory and then Drop me Off at the surgery waiting area. She introduced me to the security officer in the surgery area. Angie took my paper work and gave it to the nurses. She also gave me the security phone number in case I needed to call her if I needed her help. My Dad was so excited telling me how his surgery went well and he feels Angie made him feel comfortable at all times. I was so worried for nothing Angie kept her promise. Thank you so much for everything and I have to say It is true Angels do exist in some Hospitals.  Thank you  Security Officer Angie and everyone in the surgery Department.< /text>< pictures>

<review>I was dropped off at the front entrance for a slip I had at a grocery store by a friend because I couldn't drive due to the pain I was in and was greeted by security of whom kindly helped me into a wheelchair. From there I was rolled over to be admitted into the er. There I was asked basic admittance questions and then was rolled over to the waiting room where I waited shortly before I was called in and rolled to room/section with a curtain. I was asked some questions by the physician who I had to cut off to tell him what was wrong with me. He said he would give me something for pain and then return to give me x-rays and a full CT.
I was give a pill and a shot and then was rolled back into the waiting room. There I waited about 15- 20 mins and a male nurse came out and asked me if I was ready to go home. I was in pain so it took me a while to think of what to say because I hadn't even been examined. As I looked around for a second in bewilderment he then offered for to see the doctor.

I went in and waited for a second in a chair that I wasn't informed on that could be adjusted, which is what I needed since my siatica had been injured. I squirmed in pain and rolled over and had to noticed myself that I could ease my discomfort.
The doctor finally came in after about five minutes and told me that he prescribed me flexoral and Motrin and only prescribed the cyclobezaprine and told me I was good to go, said ok and then walked off.

When I first got there I told him about my should being I. Pain and that I couldn't even move it and he DID NOT EXAMINE me nor my arm, not even range of motion. He didn't even poke my back along my spine.

I felt like I was being treated like some junkie that only went in there for drugs when I went in there because I slipped in a store and had bad pain all over my body and wanted to make sure everything was ok and get any info I needed for an incident report.

I had to go in there when I really didn't want to at times like these and because he didn't check me out I have to go to a whole other hospital and be checked out because of other resulting injuries the doctor didn't even look into.< /review>< pics>

<review>There were two dirty cups left in the room I was taken into.   It made it very uncomfortable to be there and to concentrate on sharing my symptoms with the ER Dr.     I just wanted to run.

<review>A very pleasant experience. Everyone was friendly and helpful. I had Jennifer and Elizabeth help me with preparing me for surgery and for post recovery. Elizabeth stayed with me because I was taking longer to recover. She worked over her normal hours and assisted me with getting me drinks and Cracker until I was able to leave. Thank you for taking such good care of me and my wife. Take care and God bless.

I have never, ever been in as much pain as I was when I got to the ER here.  Ultimately I was admitted to a room where the staff tried to comfort me. The west wing staff were so accommodating and professional even though I was probably being  difficult. If I could give a 10 rating I would. They eventually figured out it was a very bad reaction to the Moderna  vaccine.

<Text>I was afraid to go to the hospital under the current situation with covid, but I was having such severe abdominal pain that I told my husband I had to go to the hospital.  From the time we walked foot inside until they discharged me everyone I had contact with was very compassionate, efficient, and professional.  My ER nurse Lauren was super sweet and caring to my needs and pain level.  The Dr assigned to me was on top of things and ordered tests that took place immediately.  I was pleasantly surprised of the quality of care I received.</Text>< date>

Had cause to go to IVMC.  Had not been there for years and I was pleasantly surprised.  Place was very clean.  No waiting in the ER.  The staff were so nice and polite.  The doctor came to introduce herself, and if yu rate hospitals like hotels, I got a 5 star treatment.  I have nothing negative about my treatment and care.  I just have to thank everyone, I mean everyone who took care of me that day.  Thank you all.</Text>

<text>I went into the er I was greeted right away by the check in nurse I told him I was scared and nervous he made sure I was okay while he was checking me in and made small talk to get my mind off things.  The insurance processer greeted me she was very well mannered and had such a great demeanor to her she made the process smooth and quick! Once I was seen by the DR he was very nice I let him know what was happening and he let me express what my concerns were he made sure to let me know everything was going to be okay! The nurse I had was very nice as well she made sure to keep checking on me and let me know when the DR would see me. Overall my experience here was truly amazing and the care that I received was out of this world everyone made me feel like I was at home!!  I dont ever wish to go back to the ER for any reason but if I do I will chose this hospital and highly recommend it to others!!< /text>< Pictures>

< Review>
It started out fine, I was shuttled in an ER exam room,, a doctor ordered a CT scan and the staff hooked up a EKG. About an hour later they informed me they found no problems. This took about an hour & a half. Take in mind I arrived at approximately 6.30am I was asked if I wanted to go home at 10.30am. No one asked if I needed anything for four hours. I had to signal to an aid to come to my room I needed water, she brought me some. They obviously thought I was fine. That’s not the inland hospital I remember. I do realize there is a Covid crisis & I was part of it. I received my second shot the day before. No Immediate reaction however the next morning I was transported to the hospital with severe muscle weakness, no fever but I couldn’t walk unassisted.</Review>

<Text>I give 2 stars because they do eventually end up helping you as much as they can. But you instantly lose faith when the ER nurses are talking bad about the ER doctors right in front of you. I sat listening to 2 nurses talk about how unfortunate it was for my husband that he was assigned to the doctor he was assigned to because he was so slow and just never cared about his patients. Not 5 minutes later that same doctor came in having no idea who any of his patients were when the nurses asked for updates. The biggest complaint is how long it took. Normally I'm very understanding, it is an ER and ppl get hurt and sometimes they need help before you, but even the nurses were talking about how they didn't understand why the doctors were so backed up when there aren't that many patients. Maybe the nurses need to remember that patients and visitors have ears and we can hear you gossiping before you turn around and lie to us about what is taking so long.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Unbelievable! My wife had Brain Surgery to remove a tumor. Surgery took 4 hours and she was put in ICU, had no control of body function and no ability to move. Her food was placed in front of her and served in containers that were sealed, she was expected to open them and feed herself. After 3 days she was still unable to move on her own as well as speak on her own. The hospital decided to release her to me (80 years old) no mobility equipment or other hospital equipment was provided. Brought her home, had to borrow a walker to get her into the house. She fell and I had to call 911 for help. The EMT's put her in bed at home and she was totally immobile for 2 days before I could get medical transport to a Rehab Center. If you have a choice, stay away from this hospital.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<text>Because of Covid I am not allowed into Surgery Center to see how my husband was treated.  I had to call them to see if he was out of surgery and told he was and come and get him.  I did that and believe he was released too early.  Perhaps they needed the space.  Sent home with only written instructions.  The nurse who delivered him to my car was not the person I spoke with on the phone so some confusion there.  I get him home read the discharge papers and see 2 drugs were prescribed but never sent over to the pharmacy.  I go to pharm and nothing.  I called doctors office and surgery center.  Received a call at 9 p.m. from a nurse who said doctor was to call.  No calls, nothing.  Not too impressed.</text>< UserId.>

Came in an ambulance to get abdominal pain checked out, and the were all very kind, and very professional.  They explained everything as they did it, and asked if I had questions.

I did have to wait quite awhile for a CT scan, but that is normal at most hospitals.

Very positive experience for an ER.</review>

MY husband was r=treated for hypoglycemia in the ER yesterday.  Even in the midst of the Covid crisis, he received excellent service and cannot say enough good things about the staff who work there.  WE have been there before and have often visited several friends who were patients there.  The service has always been  superior.</Review>

< Review>
While I'm not a fan of hospitals, upon presenting in ER with a fever after Chemo they had to admit me. Because hospitals are at  capacity these days I had to wait 9 hours in ER before a bed was available. While the bed itself became very uncomfortable, the medical staff was wonderful. And, during the 48 hours I needed to be there, all the staff made me feel cared for.<//Review>

<Text>The ER ambulance drivers, nurses and doctors are angels. They were very busy with many COVID patients and Traumas at the same time. Many were on overtime hours working tirelessly, quickly, and professionally with great accuracy. I felt safe and very well cared for. Yes,  hero’s, and life savers for the betterment of humanity.

They put you in the ER to talk to a doctor And he orders any test He believes to be necessary. Then they put you back in the waiting room until you’re called for whatever tests you need. Then  you wait there again until you’re called back to the ER for the doctor to give you the results of your test and in my case I was released and sent home. After waiting nearly 5 hours in the waiting room. I know this is not their fault there’s so much going on but it was very uncomfortable.I just pray this Covid is over soon so people can get more comfortable care. Nonetheless I had a good doctor and all the nurses were excellent. Thank you for everything Sandra Miller< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dc8316193101e5:0xbc9ab81f80024168<//gmap_id>< resp>

Mostly great service from very nice people. Registration was speedy and it took a very short time to see a very polite MD who gave me a diagnosis right away. The only problem was the long time to be release, which last almost 2 hours. I definitely will go back if needed.</Review>

Good speed of care and the staff is really nice. However, they're more of a referral service than a place to be treated — multiple times when I've been there they've "been unequipped to provide service/care" for my case and have simply forwarded me to the ER (which is a major letdown).< /text>

I checked in with easy to follow instructions.  Had a brief wait to register and staff was very friendly and helpful.  Had to go to lab which was a short and then off to surgery wait room.  The wait there was also short and every person that was staff from security to doctors were awesome and made me feel comfortable and made sure to ask if I had any questions or concerns.  I appreciate all of them especial with everything that is going on right now!<//Review>

<text>I had surgery 11/30/2020 and had to pay $600 a night for my hospital stay, they asked me to pay for 2 nights because that is the usual stay. I did so, but ended up staying one night. I called a week later about getting my money back and they said that Kaiser had to say I didn't owe any money. Fast forward a month Kaiser sent me a letter saying I didn't owe anything and my copay was only $600. I call Inland Valley and they say it takes a while to return the money into my account. I call again 3 weeks later and they said it should be returned soon. 3 months later and still nothing. I just don't understand why they have not returned my money back in to my account.<//text>< resp>

<review>Upon arriving, the guard or attendant came quickly to the car and picked up my daughter with a wheel chair (excellent).
Wait time was reasonable for checking in about fifteen mins.
Wait time to see a doctor was about an hour and a half (to long of a wait).
Wait time to get a scan (not good, waited over two hours) left the hospital at 12:30 after arriving at about 8:30 pm.
Hospital was busy and everyone was doing there job.  Luckily my daughter felt a little better so we went home.  Never received the C-T scan.
I informed a nurse and she told the doctor we were leaving.  So the doctor came out and spoke to us.  He was very understanding, recommended that we come back if the pain persisted.<//review></record>

<review>I came here for an appendicitis.  This horrible place held me for over 5 hours    lied about sending an ambulance, and is not clean. They held me while knowing that the other hospital, Kaiser, had already prepared for my appendectomy.  Do not go unless you are practically dying! Horrible hospital!<//review><rate>1< /rate>< Pics>

<Review>No nursing staff ever came in to check on me. They put me in a consultation room that was freezing and then denied me a blanket because of a fever but then never medicated me for said fever. The doctor didn't even come into the room. She called me on the phone. Yes covid is not fun but if you are afraid of catching something don't work in a hospital. To top it all off the doctor wrote a prescription for 3 times a day for 7 days as needed but only gave me 9 pills. That math really doesn't add up.<//Review>< Pictures>

I have had several major procedures at IVMC, and this last one (12-16-20) was just like all the others....PERFECT. The staff was, as always, courteous, friendly, professional, knowledgeable, caring and put me at ease from the moment I arrived till They wheeled me to my ride home. The anesthesiologist was the best I have ever had. I came out of it easily and quickly. I will never go anywhere else...They are just like the 4077th MASH unit in Korea...."BEST CARE ANYEHRE"!!!<//review>

< review>
This hospital over charged us $500.00 for a deductible that was not applicable per my insurance policy plan. We paid $600 total for my daughter’s  ER visit, $100 for copay and $500 deductible because the registration lady at the hospital said we owed a deductible (it turns out we didn’t) per our policy, which turned out to be incorrect after checking with our insurance company. I tried calling the hospital billing department multiple times to get our deductible $500 back and they have completely ignored my request for immediate refund. Please don’t trust this hospital when it comes to paying deductibles or copays, they will try to rip you off! Ask them to bill you and when you receive your statement in the mail, call your insurance company and make sure it’s correct. Otherwise, if you pay at the hospital and there is an error, you are screwed!<//review>

Thank God I decided to still be seen, the doctor was amazing and to find out I was starting to get pneumonia I was glad I ignored her ignorant comment because I was put on a bunch of different medications and had I not been seen things might of been worse for me.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Although my reason for visiting the ER was unpleasant, my experience with the staff was not. As soon as I walked through the door the security guard kindly greeted me, offered me ice for my arm and ensured I was “hanging in there” while waiting to be seen. The PA who evaluated me was thorough and understanding to my pain, as well as the x-ray tech who was gentle and accommodating. The nurse who wrapped my arm was extremely kind and helped ease my pain and worry with lighthearted jokes, which I enjoyed especially in such a stressful situation. I completely fell in love with the staff here and I’m so grateful for everyone who took care of me. I would recommend this place to anyone.<//Review>

On December 3rd I went to this facility very sick of COVID they took several exams and only gave me medicine . I was told to confine for quarantine with my family until I receive my COVID results, unfortunately my family got the virus and we all had all the symptoms.
My point is that they never called me with the results until now. I contact my primary provider to get COVID treatment.
I called inland hospital for results and they nicely informed me that I had to register on line and follow too many steps, unfortunately I din’t get success.
I really believe that this company does not care for seniors who are not capable to navigate fluidly on computers. If someone don’t have computer or doesn’t know how to use them that’s considered patients neglected</review>

I have never dealt with a hospital that was more incompetent in my life. Save yourself and your loved ones the trouble of dealing with utter ineptitude. It is only a matter of time before this hospital is served with a huge lawsuit that will bankrupt it indefinitely. Inland Valley Medical Center regularly violates HIPPA. I have counted at least 3 violations in less than 2 weeks. This hospital allowed a  stranger to visit with an unconcious John Doe, with no means to identify him, during a global pandemic even though they confirmed and cleared that the night before that his next of kin of the only person suited to see and identify him. This hospital does not share notes on patients between shifts. They also do no keep accurate information on patients either, can't even keep a birthday on a patient right after being corrected more than once. The social workers are awful, they can't even answer basic questions and do not follow through with basic services. The hospital needs a complete overhaul in leadership and I cannot wait until someone sues them for neglience to ensure that patience get the dignity, privacy and proper care that they deserve.<//Review>

From the moment I was admitted on Oct. 14 until my discharge on Oct. 22 I was in the best care that you could ever imagine. The doctors, nurses and support staff were the best and I could never have gone through what I went through without their professional and curteous care. For 24 hous a day I was in the best care possible.

<Text>Outstanding patient care with compassion and knowledge of presenting signs and symptoms.  I was impressed with the nurses and physician that cared for me.  Nothing was left to change with communication of my status. I received a completed work-up in a timely manner for my symptoms.  Moreover, my primary physician called me the same day with a follow up appointment, which was initiated by the Inland Valley ER staffs.  I am grateful for the caring and professional care received.  Many thanks.<//Text><Rating>5< /Rating><userid>111123227165022435981<//userid><Date>1584376827510</Date><username>Major King<//username>< Response>

Nurses were awesome post Microdisectomy for my back. They took good care of me, made sure I got what I needed and took the time to get to know me. For the most part the nurses took the time to build a relationship (shout out to Kayla and Allison) for being pretty new but going above and beyond.

Service was crazy fast. Got mri, X-ray, blood work done within a few hours. That would have taken days outside of the ER. Got into a room pretty fast as well. All nurses and techs very professional.

I gave a 3 because of the COVID protocols. I was able to walk out of the room several times without a mask and when I was literally being wheeled into the operating table they found out I didn’t get a COVID test. I had to wait two hours in OP prep until my rapid results came in. Extremely disappointed the hospital missed that. Sitting in pre op with more time to think about what can go wrong wasn’t cool. I believe this was a miss by ER dr not the surgery team.

I would however attend the hospital again if I needed another visit.</text>

Back again to update on my experience 3 months later.

Went in with a broken ankle.

Left with a broken ankle.

Was completely over looked.

Now I’m being called my collectors for a 1,000 bill for nothing.

Posting pics of both my ankles so you can see the difference the swollen bigger one is the broken one.

3 month later it clicks it hurts to walk on not healed and my knee is affected.

Was told by a sports medicine doctor I’m going to need physical therapy.</text>

<Text>My husband was recently in the hospital for five days in the ICU unit. I want to thank the staff for the great care he received. The nurses were knowledgeable, professional, and attentive. Everyone was friendly and anticipated my husband’s needs. Special thanks to “Mo” in physical therapy who took the time to show my husband the easiest way to put his brace on and off as well as how to get in and out of bed. I was very impressed by the fact that everyone I dealt with in the entire hospital, took the time to help me with any questions and requests.

Now all other staff nurse's, doctor's,  technicians have always been kind, helpful I recently had a nurse Hailey who was the sweetest, caring and went way above and beyond to accommodate not just me but my family members.

Check In Nurse was very calming and expedited the process so I could be evaluated by the E.R. Doctor.  The Doctor was very patient and listened to all my concerns and the information I had from the time of my Telle Appt with my Doctor on Oct.1st-8th. After that and the physical exam she put a plan of labs,xrays and ultrasound to check the areas in question to my symptoms. I was given a perscription complete print out of all my tests along with information on taking care of the issues I was experiencing for my continued care. And to make sure that My Doctor has the information of my visit and the measures taken for my health.  They were great to me and make you feel like your issues are not a generic issue.  Thanks to Inland Valley Hospital E.R.  The antibiotics are doing good my blood pressure is in lower levels but not normal yet but 1 day doesn't change the world.</Text>

The registration and information facility is sufficiently and efficiently staffed. It is clean, well placed to allow pleasant flow of patients and personnel. The inside of the emergency room, not so much,  seems a little tight.
The doctor and nurse that attended to me are nice and professional. I was quickly diagnosed and taken care of.  Overall, l was satisfied with everything.<//Text>

<review>I was greeted and taken back to the out patient surgical center all with in ten minutes.  My nurse, nicknamed Bang, was very sweet, thorough and very helpful getting me changed out of my street clothes and was very friendly getting me prepared for my procedure.  Everyone else was friendly and they made sure I was warm and comfortable before the surgery began.  After surgery I experienced the same friendliness and concern for my comfort and pain.</review>< pictures>

HORRIBLE MEDICAL RECORDS DEPARTMENT, VERY UNHELPFUL WHEN IT COMES TO DEATH CERTIFICATE INFORMATION. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THEIR SYSTEM IS SO POORLY ORGANIZED. NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW HOW TO HELP YOU OR WANT TO HELP YOU FOR THAT MATTER. I ABSOLUTELY HATE WORKING WITH THIS HOSPITAL. IF I COULD LEAVE ZERO STARS,  THAT WOULD STILL BE TOO MANY< /Text>

<Text>There was very little privacy in the emergency room. I could hear others talking to the medical staff about their issues and I didnt feel I could talk to my hospital staff in privacy which was very important to me.

I went in for a broke leg and ankle. Whole time I felt neglected. This hospital has a very negative energy. Tbh I think the staff and dr who attended  me don’t love what they do. Only 2 staff members seem to feel for me or act like they have emotions. Everyone else including the dr seem so over it. Very uncomfortable when you have unbearable pain</text>

Didn't expect such poor service at Inland Valley. Walked in to the Emergency Room entrance and stood right in front of security (you have to check in) and the security guard was just on his phone for literally a minute as I stood in front of him. I didn't interrupt him because I thought MAYBE it was something important. But after a while I walked over to the volunteer lady (who was much nicer but unfortunately I had to gi back to security). Finally he asked me "what do you want" without looking at me. Like, come on man I don't expect much but jeez you should at least man up and look at someone when you talk to them. He was some old white dude with weird ears and I regret not catching his name. Finally I left him. He didn't even give me a pass , which was the only thing I needed from him. Worthless. Truly made such a great hospital look bad. If I find him, I'm clapping.<//Text>

<text>The employees are very friendly, experienced and knowledgeable. Unfortunately, there ER is to small and not enough employees to take of injuries and sick patients. There lobby was not even full and I had to wait for four hours for someone to put in a IV in my arm. Then I had to go back into the lobby with IV in arm, wait another couple of hours to have my
x-rays, go back out to the lobby and then wait for my x-rays. Then I went back in the ER for the doctor to tell about my test results. The doctor forgot to let a nurse know I was done. Then a nurse asked me if the doctor talked to me and I said yes. Finally I had a nurse took out my IV. I was there from 11am to 5:30pm. If you need help right away I would I would an ambulance. Ambulance patients are first to have help. Walk-in patients have to wait until someone helps them. If you’re walking patient call first otherwise you’re gonna have to wait a long time.😁< /text>< Time>

On December 30, 2019 in the early evening I entered the emergency doors of the hospital. From that point forward I was treated like the only patient there. The staff, both medical and administrative we're exceptional. In all my years and experience including military and civilian, I can say without hesitation, apart from my obvious injury, this was a good experience. I would immediately recommend to anyone in the area that encounters an incident that requires immediate medical care to go to Inland without hesitation.< /text>

<review>I had gastric sleeve and gall bladder removal surgery by Dr. Suh on 9/18/20 and I was released to home on 9/20/20. The care was excellent. From preop to recovery to the med/surg unit all the nurses and staff were incredibly kind, patient, knowledgeable and comforting. Everyone was amazing but especially the following nurses, Cynthia,(preop) Lauren, Normita, Natalie and Gloria (med surg). I was too out of it to remember the names of the recovery staff but they were amazing as well. Thank you so much for making my hospital stay that much more comfortable.</review>< Resp>

Thank you for the great care. During my day and a half stay for total hip replacement, all of the nurses were great from every shift. They were concerned  about my comfort and my needs. I was fortunate enough to have a private room so I was able to get a little more rest and privacy. I even got a visit from the RN who cared for me in August! That really lifted my spirits that she cared enough to stop by my room. Thank you Kaleena!</review>

<Review>They treated me well in the OR and recovery room but when I was admitted to my hospital room I started getting forgotten!  I rang for the nurse and waited over an hour for someone to help. I ended up having to use my cell phone to call the main hospital number and ask for help. I got hung up on twice. This happened to me more than once in 10 hours. I was yelling Help! Help! and no one would come.

After I was released and went home I had to go back to the ER the pain was unbearable. It took three nurses multiple times each stabbing me to get an IV started. My arms are black and blue from all the times they tried to get blood and start the IV. They have a sign on the wall that says ‘We want you to be comfortable, if you are in pain let us know’. Well, I let them know many times, but getting pain medication is very difficult. No one wants to prescribe any since they don’t want to get in trouble. The problem is, the patient has to just suffer. I told them they should take down the sign since they won’t give you any pain medication and you are just left to suffer on your own.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Everyone that cared for me from the surgeon, the nurses, the dietician, physical therapist,  respiratory therapist, and all the essential workers that made my stay as comfortable as possible.  My only wish was for a private room but I didn't get one and my neighbor kept the lights on, the t.v. on, used her cell phone until 2 pm and by then I was wide awake and got no sleep.</Review>

This was an unfortunate and painful accident but the care I received was outstanding and professional.  My entire care team was prompt, knowledgeable, worked well together, and they all had an excellent bedside manner.  From the doctors, to the amazing nurses, the lab specialists and their painless blood draws, physical therapy and their patient encouragement, the respiratory therapists and the aides and cna’s and their excellent help and even housekeeping; all the departments were outstanding.< /Text>

We were seen in a timely manor (I would have appreciated if they had wiped down the chair I sat in for ER check-in. The patient ahead of me was clearly suffering from flu like symptoms).
Everyone was friendly and professional.
The PA Ben was extremely good.
Julie, who took the x-rays was  thorough and pleasant. The equipment seemed out dated and the lens was extremely dusty.< /Text>

I recieved gastric bypass surgery at this facility. All of the staff were very professional and courteous. I really enjoyed being assisted by Christine (nurse). She was always very helpful and upbeat, and she always took care of my concerns quickly. I'm very happy I chose to have my procedure at Inland Valley Medical Center!</Review>

Took my girlfriend here after she broke her toe. They made us wait 5 hours to be seen and then charged her $3,000 for an X-ray and a nurse practitioner to say meh it's broken just rest it. She has insurance, I'm completely irate, this hospital is run by immoral con-men who should spend the rest of their lives behind bars.<//review>

Charged $569 and $53 for two minutes with a nurse. This place is unfair and corrupt. Avoid it all all costs. There was literally no services rendered other than a few spoken words and Tylenol yet they want $569 and sent it to collections. Greedy doctors and nurses like them are one of the biggest things that are wrong with this world. Can’t believe this level of corruption can exist and I’m stuck paying for two minutes and zero services rendered other than Tylenol and not even a take home prescription!!! just wow!!! How evil!!<//text>

<review>All hospital personnel involved were very kind and showed they cared about me and my stay at Inland Valley Medical Center.

Person's that stood out:
- Trauma Team of nurses and doctor's all showed concern and interest in keeping me as calm and comfortable as possible.
- Nurse Nicolle was awesome. Caring, Kind and also funny. Bedside manner was perfect.
-  CNA Derrick was also caring, courteous and had a very good bedside manner too.
-  Nurse Mel was also responsive. attentive and comforting.

The only issue may have been the amount of time I had to wait to be discharged. The waiting time, I thought, could have been expedited a bit but that was all that I had issue with. Overall I had the best care considering the physical discomfort I was experiencing from my accident.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Prompt courteous service with each person stating their name and what procedure there were performing.  Each, especially the attending physician, seemed genuinely concerned about my welfare and were concerned to reduce my discomfort as much as possible.  Although the time was lengthy, each test has evaluated to insure that I could go home safely.  I was given clear instructional material, both orally and in writing, with recommendations for the next step in continuing evaluation and, if needed, extended treatment with my regular physician.  This is not my first visit to Inland, and, over the five years of different problems , it's quality continues at the top level.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dc8316193101e5:0xbc9ab81f80024168< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>horrible.   i was there for 8 hours.  granted, they state they were busy.  the sat me in the waiting room the entire time with excruciating abdominal pain.  they medicated me with norco after telling them that i had high sensitivity opiates.  one dr told me that they had to do blood work because my 1st troponin  had come back abnormal.   they had to do two more, causing me to be there an additional 4 hours.   the only reason we even found out about the additional 4 hour delay is because the triage nurse. Carrie (who was amazing) realized how long we where there and checked on the delay.     she helped expedite the process ,  even kept checking in on us.  she actually drew the last troponin and ran it to the lab.    by the time i was getting ready to discharge, a different dr  pulled us in and  gave me my results.   he said all was normal.   all three troponins were NORMAL.    so why do three?  i feel like it could have been because i am a kaiser patient and they saw dollar signs...   i don't know ..  i am so upset that i had to be in a waiting room.. in pain, drugged up and crawling out of my skin.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80dc8316193101e5:0xbc9ab81f80024168<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My husband was there for 5 hours complaining that he couldn't breathe.  They ran test and sat him in the waiting room when done. He continued to ask the chatty nurses for oxygen  because he couldn't breathe and they wouldn't give it to him. I picked him up and took him to Temecula hospital.I highly suggest Temecula they actually care! Not our first rodeo with Inland. They walk in slow motion lol< /text>

Similar to a lot of these honest reviews, the ER staff is completely negligent In providing adequate health care. Went in here to be misdiagnosed and treated like I was a drug addict criminal or something, simply for seeking health care here when extremely sick. Not sure how this place is still operating while providing such negligent care to patients including me. I would not come here again if my life depended on it.  Also consistent with other reviews, they seem to refuse to follow up via their contact us link they respond with and on their website</Text>

I'm not sure I get it...they don't allow you in to the ER if you have any symptoms of COVID (which I get), but they won't actually treat you if you come in with something else...BECAUSE of COVID.  I hurt my knee and they took x-rays and wouldn't do any other tests and I never saw anyone besides the nurse.  They gave me my results and talked to me openly in the waiting room about my health, despite HIPPA, with people surrounding me.  Then, without ever seeing a doctor, they sent me home to figure out what was wrong through an orthopedist.  They prescribed me Norco, even though I told her Norco makes me sick.  It was really just a waste of time.  Tell people that you won't help them BEFORE they wait the 4 hours thinking you will.  Don't use COVID as an excuse if you're not actually treating COVID patients.<//text>

<Text>I had a great experience, as far as emergency room visits go. I was coming in for pain & an injury I've been dealing with for over a month. I fell backwards, while rollerblading backwards & did some serious damage in my hand/arm/wrist. I'd been seen at 2 other E.R's and they did not do the CT scan my orthopedic dr had requested. The dr at Inland Valley Medical Center was very sympathetic & understanding to my situation & injury. The hospital was clean & all the staff was professional. I was very grateful they heard me out & didn't just give me another xray when I knew the injury wasn't coming up in those.

I now know what's going on, and am on my way to getting the long term care I need for this injury. But 2 other ERs (Scripps & Palomar) had wasted my time.

I was given great care & will be returning for any future ER needs.< /Text><name>Shannon Ream<//name></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This hospital is a nightmare.  Don't go there.  They have no concern for the patient.  My husband had an accident and required an MRI of his spine.  I was there from 8:00 AM and asked to talk the doctor to get results repeatedly.  By 3:-00 they told me the doctor had gone home.  Never saw him.  Finally another doctor came in and gave the results.  He signed a discharge notice.  Both my husband and I felt he was not able to go home because of pain and instability and stated this.  They said because the doctor signed the discharge form it could not be reversed.  When they brought his food, he could not use his arms or feed himself.  They just left the food and left the room.  If I wasn't there to feed him, I guess he just would not eat.  They never changed his bandages.  When I got him home the dressing that was on his knee wound which was stapled was bloody and around his ankle.  Again, we felt he wasn't ready to go home and had a lot of pain.  It was Saturday evening, the pharmacies were closed, and they wouldn't give me any pain medications to get him through the knight.  "It was against the rules because they weren't a pharmacy".  They have a lot of rules, but none of them are good for the patient's welfare.  I could go on and on but will stop here.  I would give it 0 stars if that was an option.</Review>

Honestly, every time I have been here the doctors and nurses don’t care . They don’t take the time to actually listen to you and pay attention to your concerns. They just try and get you in and out . They force medicine into you and then when they look at your charts some nurses / doctors think you are just trying to get medicine . On multiple occasions I have heard doctors and nurses talk negatively about me to where I can hear them. I won’t be returning to this hospital ever again.< /Review>

<Review>I had a great experience during my visit to the ER a few days ago. The nurse at check in was great she got me in to see the doctor quickly, I was surprised how fast I was put in . I was in a lot of pain. Once I saw the PA I was immediately given medication to control my pain. The entire staff was great. I saw how caring the nurses and PAs  were and how attentive to the patients needs. Thank you for helping me feel better.<//Review><response>{'time': 1570564634162, 'text': 'Monica, thank you for your wonderful note!

<review>Hope I didn't catch something there!
Was in terrible pain with a kidney stone so went to their ER instead of making the trek to a Kaiser Hospital in Riverside.. Was put in a waiting room of visibly sick( coughing and vomiting) and contagious people. No effort was made to separate people according to their illness or condition. When I was called back to a room, I was there for about 15 minutes so that I could get an IV
and meet the treating physician. It took 2 RNs and three vein attempts to draw blood and get the IV uncomfortably into my wrist. Then I was on my way to the "results waiting room" where I was left with my IV to be packed in with more sick people!   In this room, staff came in with computers, and with no regard for confidentiality asked people for their personal information.
I did receive special attention from Dr. Sims who removed me from the crowded room to discuss my results. He was the saving grace of the entire experience. Patient comfort and confidentiality, not a priority there.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Ring for a nurse, give them 10-15 minute to respond.  Hours later the Doctor comes in your room to tell you "go see your regular doctor".  Tell you the are going release, another 45 minutes go by before anyone shows up with your paperwork.

Release papers show that "Major Test and Procedures" shows that eight labels were printed at several different times between 7:36 and 7:57t. for the lab. "NO"  blood was collected
Under the circumstances  blood work needed to be done.

Urinalyses was done.

I had a great experience before and after surgery.
Pre-op RN: Rosalina “Beng” Valdez was The BEST nurse I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting. She helped me calm my nerves and made sure I had all my questions answered.

Anesthesiologists: Dr. Chen great doctor, answered all my questions, gave me options and explained what could be done to relieve my pain after surgery.... not just that, he called me the day after to make sure I was doing well and gave me more advice to control my pain and helped me calm my post surgery nerves. Amazing Anesthesiologists, thank you Dr. Chen.

Post op RN: Cindy Sterndale The little time I spent with Nurse Sterndale was great, she was also great, helped reassured me that I was doing well. Taught me how to use crutches and was very helpful in explaining what to expect.

Overall, this hospital has great staff all around. Well educated and perfect bedside manners.

Couldn’t have asked for a better team.< /text>

I had to go to the ER twice in as many weeks for two different injuries (sliced hand and broken foot), and both times were positive experiences (as much as a trip to the ER can be positive). The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, the waiting time was less than I've had at walk in clinics, and the treatment was thorough without me having to ask for services. Obviously, I hope I don't have to go back again, but I'm glad to know I'll get quality care if I do.</text>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>The last week of December I had an emergency that needed medical attention.  I went to the emergency room at Inland Valley.  I didn't have to wait hours (as I did in another local hospital) to be taken care of.  Within maybe 15 minutes my problem was discussed,  vitals were taken, my insurance info was taken and I was taken to an area to be seen by a doctor.  Within 5 minutes I was seen by the doctor, had my blood work done and the problem was diagnosed and treated.  I highly recommend this hospital.  It may not be as modern and fancy as the other local hospital but I find the doctors and nurses and general staff more efficient, compassionate and professional than other near by hospitals.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>There was one person ahead of me during the triage process.  It took about 20 minutes to triage this person who was laughing and smiling the whole time.  I, on the other hand, was in extreme pain and crying while waiting.  I was extremely annoyed the triage process took forever for the person ahead of me.  The triage nurse was also engaging in the laughs and giggles as if no other patients were waiting to get assessed.  I'd give the triage nurse a 2 star, maybe even 1 star.

However, my experience once called to the back, was great,  The PA was speedy to see me and had me in and out quickly.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>This was such a pleasant hospital experience from start to finish.  My 80 year old father had a scheduled total hip replacement with Dr. Tooma on 6/11/2019.  He didn't progress physically as fast as other patients with this surgery.  Of utmost concern has always been Dad's safety.  The nursing and physical therapy staff was completely and utterly the best I have ever encountered.  Coming to this hospital was the best decision we've ever made!!!<//Review>< rate>

<Text>It was a very busy night due to the rain and the flu, but I was treated very nicely. The nurses, radiology staff, the PA were kind and were apologetic about the wait. Visiting an ER that also is a Trauma center, I know the wait was going to be to be long. I found out there was nothing seriously wrong with me and despite the wait, I am glad I went.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1576872995986, 'text': 'Thank you for sharing your feedback with us, Mary!'}</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc8316193101e5:0xbc9ab81f80024168< /Gmap_id></record>

My husband came into the emergency room at 2:00 am.  There were only two other patients there at the time.  He had crushed his hand.  It was swollen to three times the size it should have been and very discolored and he was in serious pain.  They took an xray and said they couldn't see any broken bones and told him to follow up with his primary care doctor.  He was shocked when they went to release him without even wrapping his hand.  He asked the nurse if they were going to do anything for him and, only because he asked, they put an ace bandage on it.  The next day he went to urgent care.  The doctor there was very upset that they had sent him home like that.  He left there after having another xray (still showed no broken bones), had a half cast put on and wrapped it up.  That doctor also had him go get an MRI on it as she knew there was a lot of damage to the ligaments and muscles.  Really.... what kind of care was that he received from your hospital.  Our entire family has been using your hospital for emergencies, surgeries, and serious illness stays for the last 22 years since we moved here from the South Bay.  After that kind of care I probably will think twice about coming to you for any care again.  Was it because the doctor on staff that night was tired, not wanting to work, or just didn't care?  We are extremely disappointed in the care he received that night.  I would like to tell you the triage nurse was very nice and caring.  What happened to the doctor?< /text>

NEGLIGENT with everything they do! They love to misdiagnose and refuse any accountability for their medical negligence. KNOW YOUR RIGHTS!! I was able to contact medi-cal to report fraud so this facility can not be paid ( for their medical negligence) - I also contacted the medical and nursing boards of California to open investigations on my behalf. Why should this place be paid for refusing accountability for negligently jeopardizing people’s health and lives ? Their medical negligence in misdiagnosing almost caused unnecessary death. Who is accountable ?  The state Boards, health department, and federal levels (OCR). Stand up for yours or your loved ones health since this place refuses to<//Text>

Inland Medical is a NIGHTMARE!  Horrific treatment without regard to patient in pain!  We had over 6 hour wait, the lobby was literally empty, yet were told there were hundreds of people waiting!  My daughter was placed in a room without a hospital bed to rest her body in ER!  The room was not equipped for treatment!  She sat on hard chairs for hours.  Went in for dehydration was given the run around she wasn’t dehydrated!  When she asked for supervisor of the PA, who refused to have n Electrolyte Panel as well as blood work done, the PA went into a state of RAGE, called security to have have her removed from the tiny room!  We then proceeded to other side of lobby bc she asked for a real doctor.  Another long wait before she could be seen.
We were bullied by Security for hours who refused to give us a complaint form and continued to harass us in the lobby for no reason!

Then, we were exposed to Shingles via a room that was divided by a thin curtain!  Her condition is SERIOUS after getting a 2nd opinion!  The PA had discharged her without any tests, which would had resulted in serious conditions.

I don’t recommend this hospital to my worse enemy!!  MISDIAGNOSIS causes death!  PA diagnosed her w the FLU!< /review>

I walked into inland Valley  medical center be
cause I am in pain. I have a pinched nerve in my neck as well as a history of spinal injure going back over 20 years. The clinic I go to for primary care has spent nearly  2 months (trying quote unquote) get a referral. The Female doctor there was anything but compassionate. I tried to tell the doctor my medical history and was told to stop,  she did not need to know my medical history. I was there 2 times for nerve pain and if you add up the days versus pills received it would equal less than one per day. The pill bottles say to take 1 pill every 6 hours as needed for pain. I was treated like a drug addict and told I was being flagged. I told them to keep there pain medication and fix me then. I won't be going back there at least without picket/protest signs. I am giving them notice at Inland  valley medical that if I ever am brought to there facility in a ambulance unconscious not to treat me because I'll consider it an act of assault. I'd rather bleed out than receive service from that facility again. My advice is that you are better off going to Tijuana, Mexico for your health care needs than this place.< /text>

Absolute worst customer care and follow up I've received from a medical facility in any of the 34 Countries I've visited. Pre-op management and scheduling coordination was non existent, surgery was delayed for days, no phone or communication was provided during stay, post operative instructions were incorrect or not given at all.<//Review>

My husband suffered a brainstem stroke last Aug 5, 2018. He was flown in to this hospital as it was the closest one to the bike trail that he was in.  The doctors and staff took great care of him. They acted fast, was attentive, compassionate, and did whatever they could to save his life.  We didn't know what state he would be in after recovery.  Today, by the grace of God, he is driving, working, and riding his bike again. Thank you so much to the ICU team, PCU team, and neuro doctors.  You guys saved my husband's life. You guys are second to none!<//Text>

Went to ER with intense pain in my back near the shoulder blade area to under arm into upper front of chest. The pain had been present for at least a week and was not effected by physical or emotional stress.
Upon being brought back to visit ER DR I was given an EKG. The DR came in and asked a number of questions regarding my heart and family history of heart issues. Told him I had never had cardio issues but my farther pass at age 59 with a heart attack. I told the DR I had just completed a full cardio work up within the last few weeks. He asked exactly what did that mean because a cardio work up means different thinks. He asked if the work up had included an ultra sound, which I responded yes. I then asked him to listen to what I had to say about a stem cell injection procedure I had back in August which did not go well. He seemed reluctant to listen to what I was saying and kept his eyes downward as I explained what had happened. He then applied pressure to the top of my head and asked me to turn my head. When I turned my head to the left it cause the pain to increase. The DR then said I should make an appointment with my GP to have that addressed. DR said the ER was not there to address the issue relating to pain associated with my neck.  He then ordered a frontal chest X-ray and blood work. After he left the room a nurse (assuming she was a nurse could have been another DR) gave me 4 baby aspirin to take. It is also worth mentioning the DR asked me twice if I had ever had an angiogram. Which I had not. At this point it was obvious the DR had me on a heart attack protocol. which surprised me since my EKG and blood pressure were within the normal range.
After the X-ray and blood test I was sent back to the waiting room to wait for test results. The longer I sat there the more I realized my back pain was not going to be addressed. At that point I made the decision to leave the hospital without waiting on the test results. My logic was if I’m having a critical heart issue then the ER could call me. I was also very concerned the focus was on a heart condition and not what I was there to have address.
I believe the DR had a predetermined notion I was in some type of heart related stress and nothing was going to change his mind.
As of this writing my back is still in serious pain and my heart is doing fine. I would like to have a copy of the test (EKG, X-ray and blood) conducted while I was at the ER.
It’s very unfortunate this occurred and the DR went in a direction that was not addressing my painful condition.
Unless the test which were conduct resulted in showing a heart related issue associated with my pain I will address any billing with my insurance company.</review>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>A big mistake going there. End result it cost me 775.00 for over the counter travel sickness pills.
I couldnt not walk and could barley stand yet no assistance was givin. I was in and then sent out swift ly and told I could go back to work in 2 days. (There testing/CT scan came back negative) So instead of looking at the severity of my immediate condition they made their decision based on what came back after CT and basic physical check.
I had been seriously sick going on 2 months. I had a 4th appointment with kaiser across the street but could not make it into the building..I had extreme vertigo/sensory over load so under the circumstances thought it best to get to the ER as directed by 2 kaiser employees at the entrance who saw my condition. IT was a Big mistake,  it was probably a worse situation to be in the ER. With the vertigo and sensory overload and lack of assistance since I could barely walk than to have just made my 10 oclock app. They would have just sent me to kaiser in Murrieta for the CT and I would have saved A LOT OF MONEY AND TIME.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

It was really nice walking in and being treated right away. Being an asthmatic and having breathing issues at the time of my visit made it much less stressful knowing that I was being taken care of so quickly.< /Review>

<date>1584458046843< /date><rate>3<//rate><Review>I was admitted to IVMC on Tuesday, March 10th. The ER doctors and nurses were attentive and thorough. However, when I was put in a room on the second floor, I felt ignored and lost in the shuffle. Amelia, the RN, was caring and Dr. Gentile was helpful. My course of treatment was to have my hip aspirated to try to determine why I’m having so much pain. I laid in the hospital bed for two days before they scheduled the aspiration and, I believe, that was only because I asked the charge nurse what I needed to do to transfer to another hospital (which I fully intended to do).

My gown was changed once in the four days, I wasn’t offered any type of sponge bath. I was never given a choice of meals and therefore, barely ate anything.

When I returned home, I noticed I have a skin rash on my back and underarms.

Also, I’ve been a volunteer at IVMC for almost ten years.

If I ever need to be hospitalized again, I will refuse to go to IVMC. There are at least three other hospitals in the Murrieta/Temecula area.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Went in for a check up, after a fall inside the house , being a MS patient and severe pain under the left side towards rear, unable to lift self up, called Paramedics who took us to ER.

Exellent and timely attendance by Dr Amy Zheng and staff.They were all very helpful and took and XRay and gave pain meds.

So I was brought in via ambulance. Was treated for 2 hours before being sent home... 2 months later ALL of my bills are currently 60 days past due, along with several letters, calls and even a 30K HOSPITAL LIEN..... for what... maybe 30 minutes total of interaction with this staff. All they want is to be paid... heaven forbid you have to record from your injuries, but by then you are already in collections and your credit has taken a huge hit<//Review>

<Review>I am glad this facility has modern equipment but I feel they stap at the basic use of  old fashion tools like common knowledge, looking, asking questions, and using their experience.I came in with breathing problems.and I left with almost no air to go home. They lost my equipment.I asked for high flo liter canullas and only a few people knew about them. I use level 6 hi liter canuallas. I went home much later with your tank and it was returned the next day. This would be the second time in the past 3 years I have had oxygen problems.You have to treat us better.<//Review><Time>1580265656321<//Time><gmapID>0x80dc8316193101e5:0xbc9ab81f80024168<//gmapID>< UserId.>

Especially avoid the ED- they almost caused unnecessary death due to their negligent and unethical practices of misdiagnosing two times in one visit. They pride themselves in breaking HIPAA laws and love to discuss your private health while any one can hear it. There is certainly 0 accountability. I spent an hour on the phone yesterday trying to get to Jenn Lee the ED director, who I was told is on vacation until January 6- but if you check their facebook, this is a lie as they posted a photo of her today.

They will respond here with a link to contact them which was done MULTIPLE times without any following up.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

After having to wait  6 hours in a lot of pain, finally got an x-ray. He was then admitted and we encountered the worst hospital care you can imagine. They completely ignored the first 2 times you'd call on the call button every 20 minutes for a pain pill or IV machine that needed attending to and would beep incessantly.  Actually, it didn't seem to matter what you were calling for, they were all ignored.  After the second call, I finally went out to the nurses' station and met one of the rudest people I've ever met in my life.  She's the employee with gray hair that sits in front of a computer and answers all the calls from patients and people calling in to the hospital.  She completely ignored the fact that I was standing there requesting help. When I went closer to her so she was forced to look at me, she pretended she was deaf and still wouldn't look at me.  Completely inexcusable for anyone to treat anyone else so disrespectfully.  Shame on her!!<//Text><rating>1< /rating><user_name>Google User<//user_name>< date>

Stayed with my dad in the hospital for three days. Never saw his attending physician. Never received a call. PT staff was fantastic and the only bright spot of the whole stay. They wanted to discharge him without proper prescriptions out of the weird assumption that we’d have all of them despite the fact that none of the conditions were pre-existing. Like most hospitals you really have to advocate on behalf of the patient or they just get lost.<//Text>

I was not very pleased with the Medical treatment I received @ IVM Center. I felt as though the doctor did not show Medical Ethics, the staff was very loud while talking to other pts. So there was a HIPAA violation, & the lack of communication throughout the Hospital was obvious to me as a Pt.</text>

<Review>I was extremely disappointed in my ER visit, misdiagnosed and waiting in extreme pain for close to four hours for an x-ray we left. It was disturbing to watch the ER doctor just sitting and talking and laughing with staff while you’re waiting in pain.
The only reason that I did give 1star is because of the prescription for the Lidocaine patches they gave me on my way out.
I do not usually go to the ER unless I need to, maybe once a year if that, but to sit there in pain is inexcusable.< /Review>< Pics>

The nursing staff was very friendly when you saw them. Call lights not answered promptly or just hung up. The food is far from desirable. I had turkey serverd 3 different ways in 2 days. Never did they clean room nor did CNA come in. Only twice a day for vitals. If my surgeon worked out of a different hospital I would have tried there. Hats off to P.T and O T. The girls were.all awesome. Dont expect any kind of support from social service. If i could have gotten out of bed would have slapped her. She was of no help and very rude about it. Best in Inland Valley for hip and knee replacement. They do have all that going for them because of surgeons on board. Beware of aftercare. Today is day 3 and im home alone for 12 hrs. Because She wouldnt get me a bed in rehab.< /review>

<time>1566530476814</time><rate>1< /rate><review>Pay close attention to your bills. The hospital says they only charge for the facility and equipment. But when you ask for itemized statements they don’t make sense. Then you get a bill a year later saying it never got paid (SAVE YOUR EOB’S & RECEIPTS ) Riverside County Medical Services AMC they bill for the providers that see you at the hospital same thing their itemized statement don’t make sense. Almost like they are double dipping. Makes you wonder 🤔 if the providers know how horrible their billing services are or they don’t care.  Call your Insurance carrier prior to paying any statements to ensure they are complying with the agreement. The customer service for Riverside County Medical AMC is HORRIBLE!!! They say that they will process and take care of it and they don’t. You have to follow up 8-10 times within a year to ensure they did their jobs.<//review>< Pictures>

I've been in the ER twice, and for the same thing (kidney stones *hurt*).  Both times they were not only prompt in seeing me and treating me, they listened to me and gave me the appropriate treatment without delay and with plenty of sympathy.  They also kept my husband with me.< /review>

The care was good but if you are un insured or under insured be prepared to essentially go bankrupt. I went to inland valley ER.  I was there for 4 hours. Got labs drawn, xray and sutures on my foot. I was in between jobs w no insurance. . I started recieving Bill's 2 months later totalling 19,000.00. Really,?  Unbelievable what this place charges. Never again.< /review>

I've been to the ER here twice and the staff was really great. My son was just in ICU for 10 days and the nurses were absolutely wonderful - very attentive, and took great care of him. The Drs. were great about answering any questions we had.  Only the food wasn't that great - my son kept asking me to bring him fresh fruit. Everything else was wonderful.<//Text>

Every time I go to this ER,
I get great service! They listen. They listen to your issues and try their best to come up with several solutions and have YOU choose the best plan for you. I take my two year old child  here mostly but my man and I go as well when there is something wrong and they give the proper diagnosis and give the right prescriptions. I'm in and out in a timely matter. Its always clean. The staff are amazing and take your problems into consideration. I live 2 minutes from Hemet Valley Medical center. But will drive 40 minutes to Inland Valley. I thank them. They educate well and leave my family and I feeling satisfied with their care. Great job!</text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Do not go here! I've been to this hospital along with Rancho Springs Medical (don't go there either) a lot due to being diagnosed with pulmonary embolisms. So that is very scary and my anxiety level is through the roof I've never had any medical problems or any medical issues ever since being diagnosed with pulmonary embolism's back in January with each and every little pain I was going to these hospitals because I was scared that I had another clot all I thought was I didn't want to die so I would go in and these doctors would just constantly do CT scans on me just to rule out a clot's.  Anxiety level is through the roof I've never had any medical problems or any medical issues ever since being diagnosed with pulmonary embolism's back in January with each and every little pain I was going to these hospitals because I was scared that I had another clot all I thought was I didn't want to die so I would go in and these doctors would just constantly do CT scans on me just to rule out a clot's.  I'm the patient I'm coming in and telling you that I don't feel well you're the doctor so you do what you feel is best.  This past Monday night I went to Inland Valley Pulmonary Specialist pain in my upper right quadrant underneath my rib cage radiating to my back it was about 9 PM. The ER doctor came to me and told me that I'm a frequent flyer there and I've had multiple CT scans and he did not feel I needed another CT for something unnecessary.  I explain my symptoms and my pain I told him that I've never felt this pain before I have nausea and vomiting throughout the week.  He said that I come in complaining of every little tiny pain so there's nothing really he could do for me and he sent me home!  I had my follow-up doctor appointment for the ER visit Friday my primary physician believes I have a gallstones and needs me to have an ultrasound or CT scan stat!!!!! I'm in so much pain, still she is very upset that they did not do anything at Inland Valley and I've been dealing with this pain for over almost a week!!! Always get a second opinion and try to avoid this hospital!!!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

REVIEW OF STAFF PER MY ADMISSION AND TREATMENT ONLY!
Holy cow, I have never liked Inland Valley. I have driven to Temecula to go to THAT hospital before, just to avoid Inland. However I'm 32 weeks pregnant, and was having severe chest pains. My OB told me to go to the nearest ER and seeing as I had to drive myself, I wasn't about to risk making the trip to Rancho (where I'm set to deliver). As soon as I walked in, and they saw the belly, it was a side of Inland I've never seen. They got me admitted so fast I couldn't believe it. My nurse Stephanie was the NICEST, most attentive nurse I've ever had, and she was busy last night! But she made sure to check on me, brought me water, food, juice, helped me up when I needed, got me back down when I was done, and checked charts and tests when I was getting anxious to leave. The ultrasound tech was wonderful; they did an ultrasound to make sure my gallbladder was alright and then she showed me my baby just to make sure he's okay. The x-ray tech was so fast and made sure my babe was completely covered and protected. Stephanie took blood so quickly I didn't even realize it! And the doctor was kind, personable, and reassuring. Turns out I was just so magnesium deficient it could have caused the chest pain, so they filled me up via IV and sent me on my way with well wishes and good luck! Most people will only stop to write bad reviews, I know that. But the team last night deserves the highest praise. They treated me amazingly, they cared, and I'm so grateful.<//Text>

DO NOT COME HERE!! My husband has come here twice due to motorcycle accidents with really bad injuries we had to wait over 2 hrs to  For x-rays to be taken. They said at that time they only had 1 x-ray machine working..Really??They told us a complete different thing than what he actually had. How do we know? Because we knew something wasnt adding up.so we went to an Orange County Hospital were we actually live but since he was over in this area riding we had no option but to go to Inland. After our visit at Inland my two toodlers catch Hand, foot and mouth disease. Yes it was here and i know because the hospital is disgusting!<//Text>

I had a kidney stone and the staff from the moment I walked in helped me so much. The lady who checked me on could truly sympathize with how I was feeling because she herself had experienced a kidney stone before. The doctor that I dealt with. She went above and beyond helping me understand what I was going through and why. The nurse that gave me my shot, the nurse that checked me out, the sweet girl who did my ultrasound, and the other lady who did my x-rays all made me feel so comfortable. I have never had such an amazing experience at a hospital in my entire life. Thank you Dr. Jodie, James Bailey, Rachel  in ultrasound and the other 2 lovely  ladies I missed your names because of my pain.

Thank you security guard that walked me to my car and waited for me to drive away. I felt safe and secure. As there were a few loose cannons outside. I can't imagine what you all deal with on a daily basis.

The hospital was a little ran down, the chairs had cracks and tile old and in general could use some upgrades, but they provided hand sanitizer and masks and water for the people who are coming in so that was nice.

Everything smelt clean and after every patient I saw them wipe stuff down.

The staff all got along really well. I hope my next visit isn't anytime soon but if it is I hope I get this team again.< /review><pics>None< /pics></record>

My mom has been a patient here several times. She's inpatient currently. She was in Loma Linda last week and the difference is night and day. I can honestly say inland regional is far better! The staff is phenomenal, always there to assist. The Dr's are amazingly caring. The food my mom has been getting is amazing and the portions are large. The Dr's have been so on top of my moms care checking her labs daily. If anything ever happens to me this is where I want to go! Loma Linda staff seemed annoyed if we asked them for anything for my mom. Inland regional nurses even cared about me and brought me coffee ❤️</Review>

<Review>My experience was nothing short of amazing. The triage nurse greeted me quick, took my vitals and had me in a bed in no time. Took about 20 min to see the MD, which in an ER is nothing! Dr. Charukian, nicest man! He saw me had pain meds and my ultra sound ordered fairly quickly. The nurse started my IV and gave me pain meds. She was attentive when she saw i was still in pain and reported back to the MD. I wasnt the only patient there but they almost made me feel that way.
I got there about 4 am and discharged around 830am. Which if you have ever been in an ER is nothing. Triaged, seen, meds lab work and imaging ordered and done. I can't complain about my visit at all. I definitely wouldn't hesitate going back in an emergency.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1559938360073, 'text': 'Jessica, what a wonderful note!

I would do zero stars if I could.
<br/>
<br/>Long story short I was taken to the ER, given a CT, taken by ambulance to another hospital for another CT, then three separate sets of X-rays (because they screwed up the first time and two subsequent times after that).  Before I was admitted to my room, I was given regular treatment for my pain, and one last dose for the ride up to the room. I did not receive another treatment for 8 hours. I have compression fractures in 4 lumbar vertebrae. They never told me that my medication was on an as-needed basis and that I needed to ask. When I did ask, it took anywhere from 30-60 minutes to get treatment.
<br/>
<br/>After getting strung around all day the next day about when the doctor would release me, finally I told the charge nurse that I didn&#39;t feel safe at this facility. She told me &quot;I can&#39;t help how you feel&quot; and left the room.
<br/>
<br/>I am being held here against my will, and they won&#39;t release me to another facility.
<br/>
<br/>I don&#39;t feel safe at this hospital. I wouldnt send my parakeet here, let alone a friend or family member.<//Text>

< Review>
My dads Dr phoned in our emergency and we left right from Drs office. The Er was ready for us and took him in within minutes. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. They listened and asked appropriate questions. My dad had been sent home from Menifee Valley hospital with double pneumonia and 2 fractured vertebrae. The difference in care between the two hospitals is literally life and death. Since being admitted to Inland  valley medical center my dad has made significant improvement and whereas I was beginning to think about the end of his life,  I am now planning a family celebration. Thank you to all the staff for you care and concern in an 89 year old man who still wants to live.<//Review>

Wanted to release me while I was having major issues because of insurance costs!!! Only one doctor seemed to know what was going on.....  this place sucks!
Then they threaten you with collections constantly - harass would be more like it.  So on top of my injuries I am panicked about coming up with thousands of $$$ that I know should be covered - then to find out when I call to make a payment that they actually owe me a REFUND!!!

<text>I was charged over $4200.00 for the pleasure of sitting in the ER waiting room.  I was seen in the ER early this year. I was not examined by a doctor, a PA stuck her head in to say tests are being ordered. I  spent 98% of the time I was there in the waiting room or hallway. For that pleasure I was charged $4200.00! I received a separate Dr. bill for $2900 from a  Dr. I never saw or spoke to. All tests were itemized on top of these charges. Even with insurance I’m saddled with thousands $$ owing. The administration must be morally bankrupt to think this is an acceptable, fair practice. How does this align with the Hippocratic oath to “do no harm” ?</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I've been in the ER at Inland Valley Hospital twice in the last three weeks; once for my mother-in-law who was in terrible abdominal pain.  Everyone there were wonderful & very attentive to her needs.  Yesterday, I had to take my sister into the ER who was badly bitten by a dog that morning.  All of the staff were great & she got the best treatment from them.  I'm very impressed & I don't impress easily.  Thank you to every body there.  You were the best!<//text>

<name>Juju Mancini</name><Date>1452742389423< /Date><rate>1< /rate><Review>If I could give them a zero I would. I'm lucky I'm alive today. Four nights ago after having outpatient surgery that morning elsewhere, the ambulance took me to this hellish place because I was losing consciousness, and a lot of blood. They stuck me in a room, drew some blood, And ignored me for the next seven hours while I lay there and bled  when my doctor contacted them to see what was going on, they said oh she's just whining because her garment is too tight. In the meantime I'm getting more and more damn fading in and out but I can still hear the cackle.  of the nurses station as everyone that works there what's talking about their diets, their dates vacations and how annoying patients are. My daughter went out at one point and asked please to get some help because her mom kept passing out and was bleeding too much and they told her to calm down and shut up or leave. Six or seven hours later I was released because my blood work came back with my blood levels on the high end of low which they wrote off as natural after surgery. Unfortunately I have been bleeding profusely for the following six or seven hours and I went directly to my surgeons office since he was now open. Upon arrival my blood pressure was 60/40. In medical terms I was almost dead.  Everything I was wearing was soaked in blood and when they tried to look it just squirted out of my body. I was rushed to Loma Linda emergency room where I was immediately taken in, blood drawn, attended to, and looked after. My bloodwork came back within a half an hour showing that I was severely anemic and had lost more than half of my blood. Though they were overcrowded and I said to stay in the emergency room I was still admitted immediately and put on whole blood.  It took five bags of blood to get my blood count back to normal and save my life. Had I not gone anywhere but Inland I would not be here to write that this right now.  I suppose if you have a broken bone or something it's OK to go there if you want to wait forever to be treated rudely. But, if there is anything seriously wrong with you stay away for your own sake<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

My dads stay was unexpected, but I have to say the staff here has been great.  Tracy in pre-op was amazing!  She was very helpful on so many levels. She has a huge heart of gold not only caring for my dad, but taking the time to care for me as I was extremely
emotional and completely exhausted. Dee in recovery, nurse Chris, nurse Todd, nurse Donna, nurse Marifi, Dr. Baum and team have been professional, helpful and attentive. Thank you to the team at Inland Valley!<//Review>

I hope none of you or your loved ones find yourselves in association with this joke of a hospital. I will give credit the the handful of decent staff members that are employed there, HOWEVER the majority of the staff we have had to work with in nursing our loved one back to health has been a migraine on top of our many other headaches that brought us here. For this last week & counting we have had to rely on nurses who do not respond to the call for assistance in a timely fashion, who leave those who cannot tend to themselves for half an hour on the john, who do not respond to calls for change of soiled linen, who do not handle the patients with the kind & courteous manner that the hospital feins to represent & has posted in every room. If you can, do all in your power to stay away.< /Text>

This hospital is a joke! My husband cut his fingers on an engine fan blade. I took him straight to ER as one finger was sliced straight down the center! Not only was there NO sense of urgency, it took an hour of waiting in the waiting room in ER just to be checked in. My husband was bleeding like crazy that people in there were willing to give up their spots so he can go ahead of them and be seen...the nurse at check in wouldn’t allow it!!!! Then after check in, we are finally taken into a room for clean up and stitches. It took 3 hours of sitting in the room before the doc came in to do 13, yes 13 stitches in 3 of my husbands fingers. It was a total of 6 hours we were there. My husband has permanent damage because it too so long to get him fixed AND they didn’t even finish and dress the injury properly and he got an infection. Took him to my favorite urgent care to be fixed up. I will never go back and they are lucky I didn’t file a lawsuit!<//Review>

<Text>Nobody's around when I needed help all day 3/7 Tuesday. I asked for help to use commode, Noah came after a long wait, he helped me out of my bed, proceeded to leave me the rest of the time. I had to walk over to the trash can by the wall to throw away wipes into the trash can with the help of a walker myself, got in my bed myself without any help. I even had to wait 50 minutes to get pain pill, I asked Connie @ 5:55pm, had to asked 3 more times before Bonnie showed up @ 6:45. By then, my pain level has escalated from 3/4 to 7/8. These r just 2 examples today.
The staff today certainly r not trained well & insensitive, no empathy toward helpless patients.
The patient next to me, 233A, is complaining too. But, I'll let her do her own talking !<//Text>< time>

<text>Was butchered here. I reached out and tried to talk to the administration over and over. Filled out forms. No follow up. No calls. No results. I asked around town, and apparently this place should be torn down and the admin all arrested for negligence. Never seen a medical place, anywhere in any 3rd world country act this way and have such a horrible reputation in town. Every single person I have encountered has said similar. Let's start on a class action lawsuit. The hospital can call me if they'd like to talk but have given them many opportunities to do so.... who is with me? Let's take them out!!!! They don't deserve to hurt more people. F U Dada.</text>< pics>

INLAND VALLEY has really done some major chages for the better.
I am disabled and I got beat up in CIRCLE K because I have a SERVICE ANIMAL...I was taken to your hospital and your staff was the most compassionate and efficient team of health care professionals a patient could wish for.
YOUR NURSES are ANGELS....Youre CHAPLAIN was so comforting....We need to get a CHAPEL in our hospital.....THANK YOU.  Max and I are doing great.  Thank you.</Review>

Do not go to the ER unless you are 100% sure you need the ER. I was there for no more than 2 hours and most of the time was spent in the waiting room. I seen the doctor about 10 minutes total and I was billed 3 seperate bills. One for the doctor fees, one for the hospital, and one for the lab. The bills totaled almost 3 grand. Yes I have insurance and depending on the type of insurance you have, depends in your pay out of pocket portion but that amount of money is excessive. The doctor alone charged 947 dollars for 10 minutes. I paid 2 grand to sit on a chair in the lobby. I am going to ask for an itemized statement of how they came up with that amount. AGAIN that's excessive!<//text>

My dad has suffered from a stroke and pancreatitis and we've always come here. Any issue he's ever had he's always been treated terribly. We've come back because all his information is here so it is usually just convienet. Well this last visit he was taken to X-ray room and another nurse came out and called his name we explained he had already been taken. Less than 5 minutes later the same male nurse comes back and calls him again we inform him he is still in X-ray he rolls his eyes and throws up his hands and says "Well I was told he returned so" You are treated like a chore to them. You either get an amazing nurse or one who could care less. When you're already considered about a love one you want someone who cares.< /text>

<review>I've been to all local area hospitals ER's and have never had a negative experience.  The most recent visit was last month, had to take the husband for an on-going knee issue.  It was about 10pm, were had just came from San Diego and I did not want to go into Riverside to Kaiser.  We opted to go to Inland Valley and pay the co-pmt.   They treated him, we were in and out in under an hour.  The Dr. was honest and frank about the medications she was prescribing and overall it was a good experience.  Best money I spent.  The additional hours it would have been going into Riverside, waiting at Kaiser, drive time etc. definitely outweighed the $60.00 fee.<//review></record></dataset><record>

My buddy was in a 4 wheeler accident and the first hospital we took him to did an ultra sound and said that he needed to go to the truma hospital because he had fluid lines on his spleen. At the Inland Valley Medical Center they told him that no bones are broken ( it is clear that he has a separated shoulder) , you have some internal bruising and it is clear something is wrong with his shoulder but we don't do MRI's here so we are going to release you and you can go find somewhere else to get one. All around terrible docs terrible staff. There were 3 other people that were there when we showed up and they all were having problems with not getting the proper treatment and staff being disrespectful and rude.</Review>< pics>

<text>Visiting family- I came to inland valley this afternoon to visit a family member on the second floor. Accompanied by my wife LAPD  retired officers whom  was exceptional happy she was required to provide her ID and issued a visitor badge before access was granted for her to enter the facility. She even told the security guard kinda heavy set guy she was comfortable providing her identification card at which time he re assured her , her Information was only limited to captioning her picture and  full name only to provide full safety of her loved one while in the care of the facility. My wife  is employee by a law enforcement agency and was very impressed by the security personnel at the facility as they are not normally aware of there environment and the threats which are possible. The security personnel she interacted with was extremely professional and  even told her, her if she needed  further assistant while she was here on site at the facility to give him a call or  ask any security personnel for additional assistant.  I am not trying to make sometime out of nothing but we have recently been to  the hospital in hemet and were only left with a ER window and the a waiting room before 45 minutes had passed and someone assisted us. My wifes mother  is doing well very thankful for the   medical staff here as well.</text><response>{'time': 1497028756434, 'text': 'Hi, Jorje.

I'm So Disappointed With Most Of The Staff In The ER Department, From My Last Visit Yesterday. I Have Been Here Many Times In The Past And Have Never Experienced The Kind Of Rude, Passive,  Unprofessional Attitude's From Any Of The Nurses Or Security Staff That I Have Encountered Before Yesterday's Visit. The Doctor, Male Nurse That Assisted My Doctor, My Insurance Registration Lady And X-Ray Technician Were Thee Only 4 People Who Were Nice To Me At All During My Visit(Time)Yesterday, While I Couldn't Walk Because My Foot Hurt So Bad From A Horrible Fall And It Ended Up Being Broken In 2 Places. I Couldn't Believe That The Triage Nurse Was So Unhappy, She Didn't Even Welcome Anyone By Saying Please Wait Over There Or Good Morning, There Were No Smiles, Even While I Was Trying To Walk On Crutches Outside, The Nurses Walking Outside Didn't Have Smiles Either. The Security Guard Seemed To Have Something Personal Against Me, Even The Kind X-Ray Tech Apologized On Behalf Of Him. He Had Me Moving Around Everywhere, Telling Me To Sit In An Exact Chair In The Waiting Room When There Were Only 4 Separate Families There In A Huge Empty Waiting Room And I'm Trying To Walk With Crutches,  Where He Wants Me To Sit, In Pain And As Soon As I'm Ready To Sit He Says Loudy, "Not In That Chair,"A Few More Down....It Doesn't Matter, I Was Already On The Other Side, (not to be triaged-checked in). Only This Security Guard Kept Being Rude With Me And I Felt Bad Because I Kept Saying Good Morning To Everyone With A Smile On My Face, Even Though I Was In A Tremendous Amount Of Pain. It Was A Horrible Display Of Professionalism And Coming From A Managerial Position In The Medical Field, It's Really Sad To See That! The Last Thing Patient's Want When They Don't Feel Good, Is To Be Treated Un Kind, It Makes Everything Else You're Going Through, Feel So Much Worse! If You're Not A People Person, If You Don't Like To Talk, If You Don't Want To Be Helfpful, If You Arent Patient, Then Especially, Please Do Not Be A Nurse, It Takes Very Sincere And Special People To Do The Job Of A Nurse! I Hope That I Won't Need Another Visit Anytime Soon And That Maybe This Particular Day And Group Of Nurses-Staff Was Just An Off Day For Them, For Everyone's Sake.  Anyhow, This Was My ER Visit At Inland Valley In Wildomar.</text>

< Review>
Told the doctor that my chest was hurting and I couldn't breathe took them 45 minutes to get me a breathing treatment then finally I can talk
I can tell the nurses don't know what they're doing, and the doctors are filled with pride and ego, to the point to where they rather be wrong then make you right
They x-rayed my chest and the doctor says he's seen a little infection I asked him for antibiotics he refused... instead prescribed me prednisone which I told him I have negative response to that and that it would make me gain weight and he suggested that it wouldn't
4 weeks later I come back I'm really in bad condition it has worsened since the last time I was there same symptoms this time I have no capacity to even talk
X-ray my chest and once again tried to tell me well I still see a little infection I demanded he prescribed me antibiotics and not steroids
Because the steroids they prescribe for me put an extra 15 lbs on me... and I gained weight from the prednisone the last time they prescribed them and it put dark spots on my face... this time my back and my neck gain weight from the prednisone
After taking the antibiotic prescribed I can now Breathe No More chest pain no more mucus why didn't he prescribed this for me in the first place what is going on with these doctors and their pride it's all about the patients getting well or am I wrong???<//Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>l suffer from chronic pain. l have cervical spinal stenosis and scoliosis. l have had cervical surgery 2-7. The first time l the paramedics brought me there l was told l could get no pain meds until a family member got there. My pressure was 210/106 l ask for something to bring my pressure down l was given NOTHING. l called until l got in touch with my brother in law who lives in Los Angeles . l had to wait two hours because of traffic. There was a lady there with a family member who was a nurse at another hospital who was my voice to get something to bring my pressure down.  NOT A VERY GOOD DAY. The second time my stepdad brought me in ,my pain was a 10+ . l was told because of the medication l requested l was told l was there for a quick fix and l needed to go home. My stepdad is a Pastor and l Have never heard him raise his voice. He has to be loud just to be heard l tried to explain that l am in the state data base, but no one would. After about ten minutes a nurse recognized me from my last visit. The doctor that was on call that evening was a real PRI... Nobody should be treated like that.

<review>I had a pleasant experience (as pleasant as can be expected when being injured). I was taken here after crashing hard at Lake Elsinore MX. Knocked out completely with a little bleeding on the brain and 4 broken ribs. Nurses were very attentive and nice. Especially Marissa. Also Tay, Melissa, and Kat. They came in every hour on schedule to check me, made me comfortable and were expedient when time came for me to leave. Food wasn't all that great but it's hospital food, what do you expect? Not exactly a hospital regular, but I am assumong it could have been much worse. Remember, most people only comment when something doesn't go well so there are probably a lot of good experiences here that were not posted. Kinda like the person that gives a nice hotel one star because they forgot a towel.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I don't even know how this place is still opened they have no idea what they are doing there like my mom was just there end of December 2016 beginning of January 2017 the first time she went they told her she had a infection in her whole body but yet they didn't send her with any antibiotics she couldn't walk at all and they didn't run any test on her besides a blood test to find out about the infection they send her home with norcos I guess for pain then she goes back a second time they still don't admit her knowing she has a bad infect in her body and they didn't even know exactly where the root of the infection  was they then send her home with antibiotics mind you she still can't walk and is In extreme pain it's like the people who work there or excuse me a majority of the people who work there are people who cheated there way through medical school or went to a school where they didn't really teach or a mixture of both I'm going to do any and everything I can to either get that place closed down or for someone to take a really good look at the medical staff they have cause people's lives are in their hands and they really have no idea what they are doing</text>

<text>I was treated very badly and was ingured by employees throwing me and hurting me. Thankfully a NA was walking by and saw how they were treating me and made them stop also reported the incident and after that. I was treated very badly by employees and would lie about the things I said and also said I just wanted pain meds when I asked not to give me IV meds if possible. But all the information was misleading and not as I said. I wonder how they get away with treating people this way. Very unfortunate and I pray God brings justice from above...< /text>< pictures>

<Review>upon arrival with a separated shoulder - arm in a sling - the volunteer at the desk patted me on the shoulder!!!!!!!  OUCH
what kind of torture chamber is this?
expect a 1-2 hour wait for your "emergency"
the PA nearly laughed at me for coming in.  He said they can't fix me, but I have to go to ortho.  I was told by ortho that they can't fix me, I have to go to the ER.  So I get nothing, again!!
This entire health system is a MESS!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

The WORST HOSPITAL you can go to.  I had a kidney stone and they left me in my room for one hour and half with out any pain medication.  I was moning and no one I REPEAT no one came to my room.  Also there is a nurse SHANNON (EMERGENCY) BEWARE of her, as she is the ruddest most unprofessional nurse with no ETHICS you will ever have.   GOD SAVE YOU if you end up there!<//Text>
