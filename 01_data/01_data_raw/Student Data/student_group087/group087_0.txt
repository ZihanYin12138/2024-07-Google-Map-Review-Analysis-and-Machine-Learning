Great service!

I walked in at 5pm asking for a mani/pedi. I let the guy doing my pedicure know that I had to be gone by 5:45pm and he said it would be no problem. I was out of there by 5:40pm.

They were also super nice when I came back 30min before closing because I had accidentally smudged 2 of my toe nails one of my finger nails. They fixed it right away without giving me any dirty looks or back talk.< /review>

<review>I really wanted to like this place because it is a lot cheaper than the place I usually go to, but the service was simply sub-par. The interior was aesthetically unappealing and was in obvious need of some cosmetic work; it also smelled very strongly of chemicals. I went in today for acrylic nails and gel polish on my fingernails. The woman who did my nails (the oldest lady there, so I assumed most experienced) was unfriendly and gruff, even though I told her it was my first time there and was interested in finding a new salon. She was very rough with my hands! She cut me twice with her electric file and she literally gave my hand a little slap each time she wanted me to switch which hand was under the light. She did not have the color I had chosen from their options, but we found an other which was fine. The most irritating thing is that she refused to give me a rounded-square tip. She kept showing me on a nail remnant what my options were: SUPER square (almost duck-bill shape) or SUPER round. I showed her a picture of a squoval nail and she said “okay, round.” The finished product was indeed round, but did not even follow the lines of my natural nail. It is difficult to see in my pictures, but if you want to see their other work, they have an Instagram @josephinenails909 where you can see how crooked they make the nails. For my service I paid $30, and $3 for a tip, so $33 total. I feel bad giving them a less-than positive review, because they are obviously a family-run business, but I feel like it is an honest review, and they may be okay for some.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9ZpI86WwNt9S3pXL9JW_-d8qLABVQSb2sjIv9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEMvtmek98ks7l_f4tvOzdV9vnolc9BB3t62fT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dcaa0c6d1792d3:0xa4ce84c81a2fd703<//gmapID></record>

NAIL FUNGUS!!! Let me begin by saying initially they were very nice and I thought the Husband did a great job but the last 3x I've had the wife do my nails and she did a half*** job. She also used files that looked like they had been used several times without cleaning but since she was filing acrylic I didn't say anything (my fault) it also seems that everytime I go I have to explain what a square rounded nail is and she once did all 9 the way I requested but did the 10th coffin! It looked awful!... I had this done 1 week ago and today while shopping I hit my nail on the shopping cart slightly and my nail popped off and to my horror I saw nail fungus!!!! 4 nails are loose and now I have to remove them all to see if any other fingernails are infected!!! My nails were healthy and now I have fungus because of this place!! Please BEWARE!!! YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! I'm horrified!!!</Text>

The most terrible treatment I have ever gotten at a nail salon. The woman at the front took a look at me and straight up said that she was busy all day. Didn't try and make an appointment later with me. I am going on a late afternoon date and I'm wearing nice clothes I don't look dirty or any type of way that should have made her react that way to me. Never going here again and making sure my friends don't either.< /Text>

I travel back and forth between California and Colorado. I always make an appointment with Tai for a gel manicure and a pedicure whenever I'm in Redlands. Between here and there, she is by far, the best and most thorough manicurist I have been fortunate enough to find. She's also very friendly and personable and gives a darn good massage.<//Review>

< review>
I was very disappointed with this salon. I was in town for work and needing to kill a couple hours while waiting for my flight out of town. I planned to see my normal salon when I was back in town but I was in the Redlands area and searched for a salon with good reviews. The salon itself was run down, dirty, and hot inside. I got a pedicure and a gel manicure. In neither did the nail tech clean underneath my nails. During the pedicure he didn't take care of the sides of my big toe nails, where ingrowns can easily start if they aren't maintained. He didn't even buff the nails at all and they had dis colored slightly from having dark polish on. The massages for both were a matter of seconds in length and completely wimpy in pressure/technique. I should have waited until I got home.<//review>

Amazing customer service! So friendly and helpful, a little slow with only one person working. But tons of choices! The build your own fries were amazing and the churro ice cream bun was even better!! Made with thrifty ice cream!<//Text>

Food is mediocre, prices are just as expensive as the fair. very stingy with the toppings. Funnel cake barely had any whipped cream on top, the bottom was soggy. My carne asada fries were more fries than meat, the toppings I asked for were practically nonexistent on there.</Review>

<review>Read the reviews and went there. Waited over ten minutes for the full order.. funnel cake got cold and when I asked what was taking so long, the owner said “this is not the place for you.” So I got my money back.. bad customer service. I guess it’s not the place for my money either. Would give 0 stars if I could< /review>< time>

It's not LA quality Korean food. But in a pinch Korean BBQ will satisfy my craving. Service is no nonsense and it's not a problem with me. I don't understand some of the low ratings. Perhaps I'm just easy to please. :)<//review>

Quick, attentive service and delish food! All-you-can-eat BBQ is pretty standard. At least you know it's legit, since the tour buses roll through here pretty frequently.<//review>

<Text>The food is not bad however it’a lacking flavor. The soup that is included the taste is so so. The varieties of meat is limited. The service is bad we have to keep calling them a couple of time to order the meat.
When they brought the bill for 3 of us $71.97 + $8.80 tax and $10.99 service fee. They are mot supposed to chg us 15% tips but that’s ok. But when the credit card slip came , the total charges with tax ONLY 78.99 , theres tip portion that empty and the total the wrote 90.99. So instead of paying tip $10.00 I endup have to pay $12.00. So I go to the cashier and ask them, the answer that’s ok you can change that. Wowww that’s a rip off.

PAY ATTENTION to your credit card  slip before you  sign it and pay intention to total tax. Its different between the charge paper and the credit card slip. They are kind of fishy.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtQvFxdt69hlu_OVyOa8GlcrnpkGe8Ru0_B4Tk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6ELNzzEvEzUgb3_S7vYCkm8VR2ZfTLnA0GliK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5JrxIvuxJldVtouFwH_E9EV1qzNImGVusr8K0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoUuzFF2NuLFnQdOB5ELGGijEHE41QBd4GX_Jt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObazuoOt5SLP8TVp4jrQ2NaSKFXnCfaVcaPvKN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYRXoToKeI5SR2SvvSClE1GWd7-oCdS8GSgdEX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNd4a2VvTfYSLkmraxgfIEStBAb6vquZjOqhLfQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

<name>Yanni< /name><review>Ignored by waitress most the of the time. Charged for plate we didn't order. Automatic gratuity on party of 3. Listed as "service charge." This might fool someone into tipping twice.

Food was mediocre. Not much complexity to marinade flavor. Banchan was lame. They didn't have the fish cake or seaweed wrappers.< /review><user>106569427099371094201<//user><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

They were super rude when I told them it was false advertising. I had to pay $25 each for my kids to have all you can eat when they left still hungry. I will never visit this place again.</Review>< Pics>

<rate>4< /rate><review>AYCE Korean BBQ at fair price. Granted that the quality of the meats is ok and the selection is limited to only 6, like spencer steak, pork belly, spicy pork, chadol beef, marinated chicken and bulgogi. The banchans are vary and prepared surprisingly well. The dining room is what you expect from a no-frills family restaurant. The service is brisk and efficient, the busy servers don't have the time to chitchat. Above average compared to other Korean BBQ places in the SF vicinity. Also the final tab will also automatically include the 15% gratuity- I was going to tip more but hey, 15% is what they're going to get if they are going to include it in your bill.<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808f79883aefecb5:0x90af3e40e4053b2a< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I didn't feel welcome here and when i finished the server came back and offered rice...too late. Is a good place for BBQ style Korean food if the servers get on their game.</text>< Rating>

<text>Was the only place open at the time we needed. Wasn't expecting much from the reviews but our experience was very good. The server was very friendly and helpful. They have a large selection of banchans than we're not use to which is great since that's the reason we go to Korean bbq. Their selection of beef and pork is good although the chicken choices are very limited. But for the price it was worth it.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808f79883aefecb5:0x90af3e40e4053b2a<//Gmap_id></record>

<date>1425452406154< /date><Text>I'm not aware of many other places in the city that have 설렁탕 (beef soup).  This place is good.  They give you many side dishes 반찬 rather than just 3 or 4 in my restaurant. The side dishes are changed all the time.  So you will experience many varieties if you go a few more times.  The pancake is great as well.  Ask them to slightly over grill it to make it extra crispy and toasty.  The grill rib without bones is delicious as well but tend to be on the chewy side.  Other stew soups 찌개 are very good as well.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rating>5</rating>< Response>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>This is not a Korean BBQ all you can eat that we expected. We experienced similar all you can eat meat buffet in Los Angeles and Seattle Washington where customer service and products were 100 percent satisfied. First thing first the meat they served was not good it’s hard meat to eat after grilling. It’s really terrible. I won’t recommend this restaurant for this price. They even run out of vegetables to goes with the meat.  Server were not friendly at all. After the first order he don’t want to replace the grill and we have to ask him to have a new grill so can grill a new set of meat. Hopefully all people who is looking for this kind of all you can eat meat. No way you will eat in this terrible place. No, no no. Star at all.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808f79883aefecb5:0x90af3e40e4053b2a<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Decent Korean place. We come in on a late Friday night which there are many empty tables but have no idea why it took more than 5 minutes for a waiter to show us a table to sit. Gonna try their All-you-can-eat BBQ next time.< /review>

<review>The service was good this time around, the meat is OK quality but about par of what you would expect for all you can eat. Nothing particularly stand out but if you are craving Korean BBQ then this isn't a bad choice considering the area has slim pickings.</review>< Rating>

While i rate the Decor poor, there really isn't anything to catch your eyes to start conversation. Since the whole point of Korean BBQ and to cook your own food is to have conversation, this seriously lacks the reason to talk about where you are at. The pricing and the food though will have you keep coming back!< /Review>

Always a fun place to go. Very athentic Korean food and pretty busy during dinnee time. We usually come here for the Korean BBQ where they have a big tables with the grill and space to spread out all the food. Fast and friendly service but maybe sometimes hard to understand the servers.< /Text>

<Review>Mixed bag based on prior visits

The food served are basic Korean ones. When my mom and I visited, the seafood toufu was not fresh. Howerer, my hot stone rice were all good in every visits since then. Even my Chinese friends like there. Their pancake is awesome. I will give another try.< /Review>< pictures>

BUT thats about it in terms of good things for this place. the staff is not attentive at all even though when we came in only like 4  tables where occupied. the inattentiveness led to us waiting an absurd amount of time and me having to get up and go around to the counter to request things. then when i left a bad tip for the bad service the girl even gave me a snotty attitude!</Text>< Name>

A little pricey for Korean BBQ, but overall very delicious. Their marinade game is top notch, so I recommend the bulgogi.</Text>

<Review>Pricey.. but man.. what a meal (the BBQ at your table feast).  The meats were pre-seasoned.. but you cook them at the table with various add on seasonsings like soy bean paste (yum! never had that before), raw garlic, kimchees, etc.  What an incredible set of flavors. I've had a bit of korean BBQ.. even made my own at home. but I was so glad t otry these guys out and see how it's really done. Was a bit expensive.. and I would have appreciated a bit of coaching on what flavors go with what. espcecially for folks who have never had Korean and get a table full of raw + picked ingredients, and a pair of sissors.. hehe.. they muc hreally be confused. But I was a happy camper there tonight. Just dom't "over kimchee" as I often do, or your spouse/friends may complain for the next couple of days.. ;)<//Review>< pictures>

Service was terrible. Even though there were many empty seats, owner said we have to wait until occupied customers leave. I asked why and he said it's hard to clean both tables. It doesn't make any sense. We don't have spend money for this restaurant.<//Text>

<review>So happy I found another great Korean place near my new place. Korean BBQ House is a full-on Korean restaurant complete with grill at your table BBQs, all you can eat BBQ specials, and a variety of non-bbq dishes.

They seem super authentic, because there are a bunch of dishes that I've never seen before. Everybody knows that's the marker of an authentic ethnic restaurant, right?

The $20 AYCE BBQ special lets you choose between two options (see one of the photos). Sounds pretty cool.

They give you a variety of banchan - 8 when I ate there, but from other Yelpers pictures, more if you do bbq. Both the tofu soup and kimchi pancake were spot on. The tofu soup came piping hot - almost scalding my tongue, lots of beef, rich broth, and big portion of tofu.

Service was quick and courteous. Definitely worth a go!< /review><Gmap_id>0x808f79883aefecb5:0x90af3e40e4053b2a</Gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures><rating>4< /rating><resp>None<//resp><user>101220706149966390072< /user></record>

(Translated by Google) It's as familiar as a restaurant in Korea. The grilled fish is good and delicious.

(Translated by Google) I ate at the airport for the first time. The seaweed that is deeply boiled in seafood is delicious. It's a good hand.

(Translated by Google) I only go when I miss Korean food.
It looks like a little bit of food depending on the food.

Meat stir-fry, squid stir-fry were very delicious, and bibimbap and seafood soba were also observed.

한식이 그리울 때 다녀올만 합니다.
음식에 따라 조금 호불호가 갈리는듯 하군요.

제육볶음,  오징어볶음 아주 맛있었고 비빔밥, 해물순두부도 준수했습니다.</review>

There are many options on Steak Street, but Harris' does it well, superbly well. The corner steakhouse is luxurious, yet not pretentious; cozy, yet comfortable. They make it look so easy to be classy. The dark wood accents can be a bit stuffy to some, but I didn't mind it.< /Text>

Service and food were both lovely here.   Expected a queue so made a reservation.  However place was empty when wee got there for an early supper at 5:30.  Food came out quickly and was delicious.   We tried the fish and chips, one with haddock and another with cod.  Both were well made and delicious.   Chips were fat and crispy.   Tartare sauce was perfect!< /text>

Definitely our south coast go to for all things Italian. It very much resembles eating at your aunt and uncle's house, assuming they knew their way around an Italian kitchen. Amazing.< /Review>

<text>UPDATE : since the owner asked what was wrong.

I am Italian, thus particularly sensitive when it comes to Italian restaurants. The menu had spelling mistakes, dishes were not even close to be authentic Italian recipes and the food I ordered felt just old and defrosted.  I really don't have good memories of that meal.<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Have not been disappointed ever. To-go orders are priced lower than the menu. They are always on time with orders and go from pan to container while you wait. Intimate dining area. Good wine selection. If you like seafood and pasta, you need to try this place out. The chef knows his stuff.< /text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Discovering this restaurant early last year was one of the best parts of my 2020! This restaurant is wonderful! The prices are very reasonable, the portions are great, and the quality is delicious!! We've gone multiple times before the pandemic, as well as done takeout now that indoor dining is closed, and have never been disappointed. We have eaten here with multiple family friends, and no one has had anything but good things to say about their orders. Their pasta dishes are a favorite of mine, particularly the linguine alfredo and penne filletto, and my friends raved for days about their lamb entree. Delicious dessert here as well - I always get the tiramisu.
Indoor dining experience (pre- Covid-19): We love dining in here! It's a smaller, more intimate restaurant setting, and there seem to often be regulars around. Our server Elena is always very patient, even with larger groups or first timers who don't know what to order, and very helpful with recommendations (including the wine!). You can look into a portion of the kitchen and enjoy watching your meal prepared. Such a wonderful and homey feel to this place!
I would recommend this place to anyone!</review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

We enjoy to go out. Yesterday we  found this excellent place which friends told us about. We passed a lovely evening there with delicious dishes and a nice team and  a professional cook. We  added this restaurant in our phone list  and we will definitely return very soon. We highly recommend.< /Text>

Pizza was good. We really liked the taza. For those that are scared of habanero, this was not spicy at all. They forgot the ground beef on my pizza though but it was still good.

The Babel was also very good just wish it was crispier. I'll have to order it we'll done next time.

Vegan pizza Conscious was a hit with the vegans and carnivores in my office.
Owner reached out to me and  fixed the mishap with my order.</Text>

We were looking for some good Italian during the quarantine and wanted to support local businesses.  It was definitely some of the best Italian we have had since we were last in New York. We called ahead and even though we were late getting there, they kept the food hot for us til we arrived. Everyone was nice, service was great, food was great,  and we can't wait to go back to eat there when the quarantine is finally over.</Text>

I celebrated my PhD last night in this gorgeous place. Well we had a brilliant evening and the venue was surely one of the reasons for the outstanding event. The team  helped in a gorgeous style, the cuisine was delicious and my guests were very  joyful. We shall definitely return for more celebrations. thanks very much.</Review>

Amazing italian food. They have good selection of Appetizers, Entree and desserts. They make their own sauces. I really liked the wine sauce they put in the Goat cheese raviolis. Awesome Tiramisu 👍</text>

The service and quality of the food needs a lot of work. While they seem to use good ingredients the food is under seasoned.

Most of our order was wrong. Then the lamb shanks were not cooked completely. We noticed towards the end that short hairs from the cooks arm (we hope) we in the sauce.

If you love great Italian food, go elsewhere.

This would be a perfect candidate for Robert Irvine's crew from restaurant impossible.

----
Update: Turns out my wife got sick from the food, food poisoning -- not good.

We also got a reply that exhibited zero customer service acumen and instead complained about the bad review.

This reaffirms our recommendation that people skip this place.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1565159040063, 'text': "You just put a same review on yelp .I don't know what you try to do and you left so many bad reviews for many businesses. Thas not cool"}</Resp></record></dataset><record>

I have been several times to this restaurant. I love their pasta. Calamari are super good as well. Very close to the taste of the ones in good restaurants in Italy. You can see the cook preparing your dishes. Tiny restaurant. Good ambiance. I do recommend.</Text>

This was absolutely the finest dinner experience I've had in months! The calamari appetizer was delicious! And our entrees were just fantastic. Dave, the owner, and I talked as he was cooking, and he was so incredibly friendly and kind. Elana, our waitress, was outstanding and treated us like close friends or even like family member! It was an extraordinary time. And then, when they found out I was one of the 40,000 folks that lost our city of Paradise in November, they gave us the delicious chocolate cake and Tiramasu we ordered for dessert as a gift! I'm still marveling at their kindness, generosity and absolutely delicious food! I wish I could recommended them more than 5 stars but I hope this will suffice. Go! Enjoy! And have an absolutely wonderful time at a place you will call "home"! My daughter has gone many times and said their quality never wavers either. The prices are almost too low for such a treat! This is a perfect place for phenomenal food at an unbelievably low price, and the atmosphere is a hoot! Noisy, but like being at home with the family. You are going to be glad you went!</review>

Was told by the hotel that I was staying at that this restaurant was good Italian and that it was family/ child friendly- not so! The waiter cane to the table took half of our orders, we had to ask to place the rest of our order when he returned. He seemed completely frustrated that we had kids with us. They left the door open where there were other patrons outside smoking and the smoke was coming into the restaurant. The food was mediocre at best. Only redeeming quality was the wine and beer selection.</Review>

<text>Great Small, Intimate Italian Bistro.  It is rather tight quarters, but pretty darn good service considering only one server and a full house.  It is obvious they have many, many repeat customers.   The sauted Calamari was fantastic,  highly recommend.  I also had the seafood fettuccini which was also pretty good, albeit maybe a tad bit too oily for me.  If I was to make any complaint, it would be the bread.  Not all that great really, they could certainly step this up a notch or two. I will definitely return.</text>< Gmap_id>

<review>Small place but huge flavor. The owner is extremely friendly and you can watch him make the food. We have seen him use 17 pans at a time! Delicious Italian cuisine at reasonable prices.</review>< UserId.>

Amazing! Quaint and perfect little restaurant that serves authentic italian food. One of the coolest things they offered was a non-traditional kids menu where you could order anything on the menu and they make it a smaller portion for children...and it's still a healthy portion. Great dining experience.<//review>

Didnt actually get to expirence the restruant since they were closed for labor day, which is understandable but I didnt see anything mentioning it on the front page of their website so I tried calling and their answering machine said 'we are open SEVEN DAYS A WEEK from 4 til close, we do not take reservations, see you soon, ciao.' If you're going to close for holidays that's fine, but at least update your answering message.</review>

<Review>I love this place.  The food is really good.  The people are really warm and friendly.   It's like being invited over to dinner at friends' house.  My favorite is the lamb shank but I also really like the tequila salmon.   My wife's favorite is the black linguini.  The tiramisu is some of the best I've ever had.  Good food.

This place is one of my families favorites. The food is phenomenal. I love the black linguini. The salmon is always cooked perfectly when I get the tequila salmon or add it to any salad. You can order steak rare and it will arrive rare everytime. Not to mention he will add the four cheese sauce to the steak 😍. This is a small place run by a very hard working man. It is open 7 days a week and he is there everyday hustling. He cooks every dish! He is also always moving if he isnt cooking, he will take people' orders, bussing tables, he cannot keep still and it is inspiring to watch.< /Text>

The service is always wonderful here. From the first time my wife and I visited we felt welcome and like we were regulars. The restaurant is always busy but always happy to take our business. The food was as good as the service...the chef made everything fresh and only after order. I recommend the black seafood linguine...but honestly all of the pasta is delicious. Make sure you save room for the white chocolate gelato! This is honestly one of OCs best hidden gems.<//Text>

Great local spot, true hidden gem, they accepted us and served us food 5 minutes before closing time.  Anybody else would have said, sorry we're closing.</text>

(Translated by Google) The owner refuses to wear a mask, says that it does not suit him because he is healthy and does not care about the integrity of his customers. He laughs at them and you don't want to know how dirty the kitchen has, the oil in the deep fryer is the same since the day it opened. It is better to eat from the garbage than to be fooled by this patient.

(Original)
El dueño se niega a usar mascarilla, dice que eso no va con el porque está sano y le da igual la integridad de sus clientes. Se ríe de ellos y no queráis saber cómo tiene la cocina de suciedad, el aceite de la freidora es el mismo desde el día de la apertura. Es preferible comer de la basura que dejarse engañar por este enfermo.</text>

Smallish location compared to others, with a lot of equipment neatly packed in. What stood out was the service, which was friendly and not too intimidating. It’s been a while since I’ve been in a gym for a formal workout and expected some meathead to look down on my lack of physicality :). A steady, the people up front looked “normal” enough and didn’t have that gym rat mentality. They definitely tried to up sell services, but were not pushy. Funniest thing was it took some time to figure out the Bike and weight machines. Pedal power for the bike to start the time (who knew) and different settings along with traditional pins for the weight machines. Oh how things have changed.

Anyway off for my first workout in a gym in 20 years and left after about an hour and a half. Leg and arms are a bit sore today but looking forward to a few more sessions. I definitely prefer being outdoors, biking, golfing or swimming but this is a good alternative for the winter months. Pretty good deal for two years at Costco too.<//Review>

<text>I love this 24 Hours Fitness location. Excellent environment and great staff.
I specifically want to mention Ms. Dey and the kids club. She is super helpful and provide amazing customer service.
This is definitely my most favorite 24 Hours Fitness nationwide.</text>< pictures>

I have always liked the gym. The people who work there make sure that you are getting what you need. I have also been working with Jacob Salvador as my trainer. He has done extensive research to work with my medical issues. A fine place with good people.< /review>

rating is based on weekend times between: 1-4 pm and weekdays between 5-6 am

variety of weight training equipment: B
number of treadmills: A+
number of stairclimbers: A+
age of machines: C
gym hygiene: A 3-4 cleaning stations
Parking: A+
Locker Room (men): B
the showers are single stalled but open, so dont expect too much privacy. otherwise its clean.
staff: a little less social than other 24 hr fitnesses
number of water fountains: 3 good water pressure

bottom line: highly recommend this gym if u dont wanna stress about parking, and access to a threadmill.< /Text>

I only go here since its close to my home.  Given how high dues are, management should prioritize fixing equipment.  Its kind of sad.</review>

<Text>This is my goto gym and I had no problem with, even tho it's bit small and dated but hey it's enough for me. The front desks are usually nice and friendly... Until my gym membership from Costco expired. I brought in my new Costco membership, I was turned away by the girl saying that I can no longer use that promotion and it's for new members only. Thank goodness I have a friend who's a club manager at 24 which I was informed that's NOT TRUE so yes, you can renew your Costco membership, don't allow them to turn you away like they did to me. I'm just gona activate mine online. I get that it's probably part of their jobs but this just leaves a bad customer experience in my book. Hopefully this doesn't happen to anyone else.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Your treadmills are dangerous, they tend to abruptly stop. If it wasn't for that I would give this gym 5 stars and it closes 🤔</Text>

It's ok, most of the machines are outdated and it closes at 11:59 which sucks for me because my work schedule is hectic and it's right next to my house so I have to drive 15-20 mins to the next one.< /review>

<text>Came to this location in the past and I was seriously bothered by the lighting at this place.   It was a weird color like too much orange or yellow.  Yea call me weird or whatever but that makes a difference for me.  I haven't been back since but who knows maybe they changed out the lights by now.<//text>< rate>

Friendly staff. Safety guidelines are in affect from the time you enter.

A mistake was made with my husband's order. We didn't realize it until after we had left. We called to bring light of the error. They were very courteous, and offered to correct it upon our return. A+++ !</Text>

Placed the order through the app. Ordered a hot pastrami sandwich lunch combo, got home to enjoy this. First thing it was missing the chips it says it came with, then opening the sandwich It was a measly one slice of pastrami when the picture in the app shows a good amount of pastrami and toppings. Very disappointed and poor way to spend my money on lunch.</review>

<text>3.5, they really need more stars or move to a 1 - 10 ranking.  I'd give it a 7 out of 10.  Bagels are pretty good, I'm from NYC.  The coffee was fine, and I've gone to Noah's for over a decade, most visits in Westwood.   The negatives to this place is the length of time to get through the line.  Sometimes I get a wedge of cream cheese and other times I get a thin coating, nit picking there.

A better rating is 7 out of 10.  The place has good bagels, fresh out of the oven and they are really really good.<//text>< Pictures>

I stood there for about 4 minutes while getting ignored by the 3 people behind the counter. I figured if they treat their customers like that, how do they treat the food being prepared in the back room. No thanks. I wen to Ralph's for bagels instead.</text>< GmapID>

<Text>Great quality food and beverages. Love this place. 4 stars because of theor customer service process. Waiting on an order i have taken someone elses order that shares my name. Also did not hear them call my name once, and they never called it twice, plus they took my order from the counter so i did not see it.
Their interaction with customers is 👍  their process is not.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

What we got was something that looked like it had been assembled by a 2 year old.  One sandwich was literally a pile of goo.  OK,  it was more a mixed jumble of goo not resembling a sandwich  at all.  The other looked ok.  Flavor wise neither sandwich tasted good at all.  I would suggest taking a sandwich from a stranger in a dark alley before going to this location.
I have been to other Noah's Bagels and the sandwiches looked delicious and tasted wonderful.   I am not sure if this is a failing on the part of this location or if the quality has gone down all around.  But I do know I will not be returning.<//review><username>Victor SaintOn (The Last King of Disco)</username><userid>103228350470508822991<//userid><Resp>None<//Resp>< rate>

Toasted sourdough bagel with cream cheese is great. Also like the breakfast egg-mit. Parking lot can be a little crowded but it's worth walking a few steps.<//text>

<Review>The guy there working by himself was very kind and quick. The bagel was good and still hot after a while. The only downside is the iced coffee that was the only thing that did not meet my expectations.<//Review><pics>None</pics><user>106344205285289518536</user>< Response>

A favorite place for me to get my bagels. Favorite ones are the pretzel, French toast and blueberry. Wide variety of bagels, breads, pastries and creams to choose from.<//review>

Mushy bagels with tasteless cream cheese. I wouldn't trust the LOX. Breakfast sandwiches are mediocre/poor. This place fails the "is it better than cooking for yourself at home" test. Pass.<//review>

<review>They were not able to cook eggs at 3pm... I got there at 3 and there machines were already turned off. People were still showing up and they litterally couldnt make a breakfast sandwich... I dont think that happens at the other Noahs Bagels. They closed at 4 but there is no point showing up after 2:30 pm< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80e84d49021f99af:0x4292d7c73df99a6e< /gmap_id></record>

(Translated by Google) Great food with fresh bagels and fresh ingredients, great and healthy selection! Cozy. Good coffee! Here you meet and talk to nice people. Large parking in front of the door. Recommended!

< review>
The service was great.
Fernando, and a lady there helped me to choose a car.
Fernando was so helpful and also very positive  person.
I was a little worried about how things may turn out, but Fernando’s willingness to help really calmed me.
I wish everybody was like Fair’s employees.
These guys are great and really helpful👍🏻
Thanks to Fair and its employees<//review>

The vehicle selection is great.  Rented a nice Jeep Patriot. Cost is much too expensive to continue use. The customer service that the company provides is great. The pick up and drop off is easy and seamless. Be sure to make sure that the inside of the vehicle is clean prior to accepting it. There was pet hair in the cargo area initially and spillage inside the cup holders. After requesting that it be cleaned, there was no problem.</review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>I need your help immediately! An immediate response from management is being requested. I have been contacted your customer service department multiple times over the last 3 MONTHS requesting my new tags as my current ones expired a month or two after I leased a car with your company. Absolutely no one in your customer service department has returned my calls or emailed me with updates. I have been given a ticket and sent a letter stating that if I do not submit current registration my licence will be suspended. If this issue is not resolved within 24 hours I will contact the better business bureau, your corporate office and my attorney.

Thank you,< /Text>< Pics>

My dad bought me a car which is camry se 2018 on Christmas. Yeeey I'm very happy with my new car . I appreciate the service I received from Alex Milan ! He was not pushy as i had experienced elsewhere and answered all our questions unrushred with friendly manner. Also Thankful for the manager Ed Cortez ! His explanations of everything were crystal clear . I'd definitely recommend Fair - UBER car rental station because of these knowledgeable people that I received a service. Thank you again guys God bless you !< /text>

This place robbed me as a single mother. I paid 185.00 and I was not activated for over 3 weeks. They left me with no earnings and they lied about the 24 to 48hr document policy. Also, FAIR HAS NO FIRST PARTY INSURANCE COVERAGE be careful your relying on the other driver to pay for your losses.They breached agreement and phone support lies. This company should be closed. Go to avis or hertz only. They are real companies.< /text>

Horrible customer service. Horrible company. Car had mechanical problems but they would not let me return it or trade it for a different car and instead said I should go spend my own time getting the car repaired and they would pay for it only if it was covered. It was all together an awful experience.</Text>

So terrible service, I had a car from fair and it was having few issues and also needed jump start every 2 days. I returned the car as per their instructions and got no replacement car. They asked me to book another and pick it up from 45mi which I did and still doesn’t show on my Uber app. They asked me to check with Uber and I went to Uber green light hub and come to know that Fair didn’t dispatch in the systems. I called fair and informed about it they said it might take 24 hours. When I informed them that the issue I am having from past few days. They told me it’s 48 business hours and might take until Monday. Which will be more than a week. They don’t care if you can drive with Uber or not they will just handover their car and you will pay the rental for their delay, communication gap and other issues. Each of them have different answer for your issue except the one same answer ‘WE ARE HAVING SYSTEM GLITCH’.</text>

They ended a contract two days earlier without notice because according to them the contract was up in two days anyways. As a result the car got repossesed in the middle of the night in the freezing weather. They did not even make an attempt to rectify this, it was like they can care less. If you want to get your car towed in the middle of the night and get stuck out in the middle of nowhere go with these guys. They will treat you different I'm sure.< /text>

Terrible. Do not rent with Fair. I had rented a car to drive for Uber and after I returned it in the EXACT same condition I brought it back in they only returned part of my deposit and I couldn’t figure out why. They charged me for damage to the car and for not bringing it back at the same gas level. When I picked up the car it was filthy, I asked the agent there if they can please clean the car, he just said he could run a hose over it, and that’s exactly what he did. I went down the street to get the car washed out of my own pocket and noticed a touched up scratch on the door. I went back to tell the agent and he said it looks like a repair one of their guys did and that he would note my account. Obviously he didn’t otherwise I would not have had to fight with Fair’s customer service and the location itself to get this all sorted out. After a month... A MONTH of going back and forth they finally found the evidence they needed (and I submitted all the photos I took of the damage and the gas level when I picked up the car, make sure you take pictures if you do rent to cover your back with this company). After all of that, calling me a liar and making me go back to the location itself to get things moving in the right direction they did nothing to make up for all of the inconvenience. Not that I wanted to rent from them again but because I didn’t have a rented vehicle by the time it all got resolved they said they couldn’t give me any credits for any future rentals. Shame on Fair and the employees that don’t do their job. IF you still want to rent with them make sure they give you a CLEAN CAR. The corporate office told me they are supposed to clean the cars at the rental location. The rental location said they don’t do it there but will take you down the street to the car wash and pay to have them wash it. Either way make sure they give you a clean car.< /Text>

Fair has a culture of poor customer service. Their support agents don’t know anything what’s happening on the field. They read what the TelePrompTer says and don’t take action on your concerns. It takes an hour for them to answer. 90 percent of their cars sucks and charge you the price of the usual rental cars like Budget or Enterprise. I’m getting their car for Uber purposes but someone in the Fair hierarchy linked my car to another account. As of this writing I’m in a Fair location waiting for the manager to help me. Been hours waiting for a Toni or Carl and ate packs of their complimentary chips or probably be able to eat the rest waiting for someone to help me. Gave 2 stars where it should be negative or zero for some good guys around here; Dave from the Lawndale location and Maggie stationed in the Uber Hub in Redondo<//text>

Un maintained cars they put you on the road to find out there car defects then tell you to fix it on your time and still charge you for the rental without a replacement , oh by the way the car they rented me was under factory  recall I would think a reputable  company would have known that shear negligence  on there part , time to find a lawyer .</text>

When the car finally is ready, they give you a 6 hour window to pick it up.  The customer service on line and on the phone is sub-par to say the least.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I got the dip powder, my nails were okay’ish!
My main complaint was how FILTHY the place was. I have a cosmetology license and I don’t know how this place passes state board! To top it off a live large cockroach crawled across the floor in front or me! Absolutely disgusting!!!! I would never ever return!!!<//Review>

< review>
By far one of the worst set of nails I've ever had done. I've been having my nails done for the last 15 years and pretty much stick with the same design of pink and white. There was a man who did this set and he was completely annoyed the whole time like I was such an inconvenience to his life. I tried to do some general polite Small Talk he refused to speak to me and did an incredibly bad job. I told him I wanted a standard pink and white he proceeded to put on a white tip with clear acrylic and then charge me for the pink and white which is about a $10 difference normally but he charged me a $15 difference. I went in for a pedicure at the same time the lady was very polite and did a fairly decent job but the quality is not there. The nails lasted about 5 days before they all lifted and 2 Broke and I'm not at all hard on my nails in comparison to others. This will be my last visit to this salon which is a little unfortunate.<//review>

When we went and we were switched seats twice. I went in with my cousin to get a short gel manicure. My cousin left with wet nails, The entire time the lady doing our nails was walking around and talking to other people and seating other people. My cousins nails got done in five minutes and we’re not dry all the way. She got up about four times during mine to focus on other people. The experience was bad, and I felt like an annoyance the entire time.< /Text>

I’ve been a customer of Happiness Nails for about 7 years now and I’ve never been disappointed with their service or work. They really care about their customers and I can attest to that because they are very personable and always keep conversations going. They will also ask if you like how they did your nails and will do their best to make it your best experience! Lastly, I recommend their wax. They’re really gentle and can surely remove unwanted hair! :)

Thank you Happiness Nails and Spa!</Review>

I’ve been a customer of Happiness Nails for several years. I’m very pleased with the service I’ve received. Mickey is my favorite manicurist. She’s professional, personable, and proficient. My nails have a challenging curve and she always makes them look beautiful I frequently receive compliments. The environment is clean and well appointed. Complimentary beverages (including wine) are offered.<//text>

Well I get in my car and I called my bank and this lady charged me $90 I did report this to my bank and I will never ever go here again please when you come here check your cards or ask for a receipt, my biggest mistake to not ask for one and she didn’t offer me one either now I know why because her intentions were to steal from me that’s sooo sad i feel bad  For you, you really go to the extent of stealing from your customers shame on you<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Horrible experience. Wife, child, and I went to get pedicures. My wife anf child both had ants on there chairs and shoes. My child got bit a few times. Of course they didn't express thia to me till after we left cause I am one to speak up. They said the ladies notices the ants on their shoes and just dusted them off. I recommend before they start on your nails you look around u. I will not be going back.< /review>

<Text>Just left from there and I will never return. I got a french tip manicure and the lady messed up. It was completely crooked and when I told her she messed up, she was rude and said she didn't see anything wrong with them so I asked if she could just take them off and I will go somewhere else and she told me that's fine but she was still going to charge me for everything. Then told me she would fix it. While she was fixing it she was extremely rude and started talking about me in a different language. When going to pay my total came out to $85.00 and I was like how on earth but when I asked her about it she rushed me out the door.
I have been one other time and the lady did an amazing job but because I brought my own gel polish she made fun of me in her language. I know she made fun of me because she held up my polish and started making funny faces and when I made eye contact with her she looked down.
I am extremely annoyed with the way I was treated and as I stated I will not be back. Lastly it is dirty and cluttered.<//Text><userid>108959275824791044636<//userid>< rate>

Not too bad there was a couple things that I didnt like 1st and most important was I dont like that they reuse the toe separators I didnt noticed they where used till she was done cause the had dark nail polish on them and I was getting a white tip. They say that water and soda is free but when I asked if I can plz have a water when she gets a chance. Well I guess she never had a chance. The services is good but they are pushy for you to get extra stuff that u really don't need.i does see that they actually do a good job to sanitize the tools but I never saw her was the toe separators.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

It was bad at first but but definitely fixed it at the end. I waited a little long and it took forever for my nails to get done but I don't mind it. Lady kept asking if I liked it or if it was okay and I usually don't get that. Some workers we're laying down and just napping but wasn't really focused.</text>

<Text>I went in there last week to get my eyebrows waxed before I go to the Marine's Ball this week. They were so rough and rude! The wax was way too hot that I had burns. My eyebrows were not even. The lady didn't even remove the remaining wax off. I usually get my eyebrows waxed, and this was by far one of the worst experience. The lady rushed me to pay and rushed me out the door. I won't be returning.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I got my nails done acrylic, the lady who did it was having trouble setting the acrylic on the nail but before that when she was applying the tip she was hardly putting glue which made the acrylic lift when it was drying. When she started to file my nails she wasn’t even filing  them to at least look even to eachother i wanted coffin but ended up getting slanted tips not even close to coffin, 4 days passed and a nail popped off and i had gone to get them fixed and the lady that fixed it has seen my trashy my nails and even had other employees look at the horrible job, she attempted to fix two but guess what 2 days now and the ones she has fixed are lifting badly and the gel clear coat is peeling off , i spent 45$ on the worst nails ever i wouldn’t recommended this place i gave them the benefit of the doubt once again just to be disappointed.< /Text>< Pics>

Do NOT come to this nail spa!!!! It was the most horrible experience!! From the customer service to the actual job. My daughter got a full set and they where lumpy and the polish was really thick and it went beyond the nail bed. I got a pedicure with gel polish and when I got home the polish was bubbled up. I called them to let them know I wanted a refund they told me they “would” if my daughter would have the acrylics taken off and if I had my gel polish taken off. I then went back to them and when I walked in and told them what I was there for they argued and said they would NOT give me my money back. This is a horrible place. I wish I would have read the reviews before coming here.< /Text>

< Review>
I would give this place 0 stars if I could. 1st off, the place is DIRTY. Stuff scattered everywhere and when I sat down, the station I was seated at was dirty too I thought "oh no, but I need my nails done asap" all shops around me were busy because of graduations and stuff so I just chose to go to this one. The girl had barely started taking off nail polish on my right thumb and gets up abruptly and just walks away for a 10 minute break. That's ridiculous. And she did not shape my nails all that great either. They were crooked and not cute. 2 of my nails were different lengths and not close to being symmetrical. And she was pushy. PLUS, they charge way too much. 25 dollars for a fill? I get full sets at my regular shop for that price. I wouldn't go here again if it was my last resort.<//Review>

I just left the salon,( if you can call it like that)Worse experience ever, that place is dirty the equipment is dirty, i went there to get my nails done, they were rude since the beginning. They were just trying to rush me out, when she was going my nails she was so  rough. I will never go back here! I paid $50 dollars for a nail set that didnt came out nice.< /review>

<pics>None< /pics><text>I went in 2 weeks ago to get a full set of white tips. Don't remember the man tech that did my nails but one nail he glued on did not glue correctly in the corner of my thumb. I let him know that the nail did not glue correctly in he just blue it off. He put acrylic on the actual nail and water got in the nail n started lifting immediately. That' is poorly service. I will never go there again. Terrible service.< /text><Response>None< /Response>< user_id>

They are liars! I went in and bought a gift certificate and made sure I asked all the questions that I needed to make sure I got the right certificate and they said yes a full set will be covered in this gc when my wife went in they said she had to pay extra amd the gc didnt cover a full set. They just want to get you in there and charge you more for everything</text>

Worst experience ever..!! I asked for a full set and when it was my turn she was just doing a manicure  and when i told her i wanted a full set she got mad and talking talking their language  and just left me for another costumer without explaining what was going to be done and had a attitude when I asked to speak for the one in charge. So rude and didn't seem they didnt wanted our business. NEXT!!!<//text>

Elisha Gonzales was AMAZING to work with. She listened to our every need and got to work. What I really appreciated was that she was not overbearingly pushy. She gave us suggestions and gave us the space to make the decision. When it came to solidifying a final offer she wasn't hesitant in getting creative, resulting in our offer being accepted. Elisha continued to be a driving force with grace and respect to the very end and beyond.
If you are needing a realtor that will be in your corner, contact Elisha Gonzales!</review>

<review>This was a very tough market that we chose to look for a house in. James stuck with us and all of our picky qualities. His team did a outstanding job from beginning to end. They where knowledgeable about any situation and end the end we purchased a home with everything we wanted. I highly recommend this company.</review>< username>

My wife and I are first time home buyers and having Erin Anderson and her team at Realty Concepts was amazing. The depth of knowledge she has and the amazing treatment we received was second to none. We were treated as if we were her only clients. The line of communication and response time were prompt. She was culturally sensitive to our needs. She made herself available when we needed her. Erin took her time to explain and answer our concerns and questions, making sure we understand the process. If you are in the market for a house, we strongly recommend Erin Anderson with Realty Concepts.<//text>

<response>None< /response><review>Melissa was incredible. My husband and I had tried two different realtors before her and they both treated us like they didn’t have time for us. We contacted Melissa because of a friend’s suggestion and she was on it. From the moment we hung up the phone and every second after. Completely ready and willing to answer questions, finding houses, showing properties at any time, and  had great strategic techniques when it came to drafting offers and negotiations. Melissa is very upbeat and seems to truly love her job. I would recommend her to literally anyone I meet. She really is amazing at her job and a wonderful person. If you’re reading this and wondering if she’s the right realtor for you… SHE IS!!!!<//review>< user_name>

<review>Selling your home is a huge emotional and financial decision. It is so important to have an agent that is compassionate as well as professional and Lisett Ramirez went above and beyond my expectations! I have been in the financial industry for over 16 years and own several homes, these experiences have resulted in very high ethical, transactional, and customer service standards. Lisett never let me down or question my decision to trust her with my home. Give her a call!<//review>< Rate>

<Time>1627501156967< /Time><Rate>5</Rate><review>Jenny Toste and Judy Stumpf are the consummate professionals. Jenny was on top of the listing from the very beginning.  She went above and beyond to market the property and kept us apprised of any interest and offers along the way.  During a lull in interested parties we worked together to adjust the price accordingly.  When the sale was made she was in touch with us regularly during the entire escrow process.

Judy was incredibly efficient in sending any documents to be signed within a very short period of time after any changes/updates were discussed with Jenny.

All in all, these two are a great team and I would recommend them to anyone in the area requesting professional real estate assistance.

Thank you both from the bottom of our hearts.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x8094681684776ac5:0x103186571293ef1b< /gmap_id></record>

We worked with Tara Scott, of Realty Concepts, to buy a vacation home on the coast. Tara was extremely efficient, and helpful during our house hunt. She was a joy to work with and proved very valuable in getting us to close early…one week ahead of our 30 day escrow time frame!  She smoothly coordinated logistics with the sellers representative, escrow officer and our lender. We were impressed with her finesse and professionalism!</Review>

<Review>My agent Jenny Toste worked hard to help me find the home that worked for me. She stuck it out with me even when I talked myself out of a couple different houses. When I was not sure what to pick, she typed out a pros and cons list to help me see what the properties offered. We have been working together for a year and I finally bought my home. No matter what she was there to help me through the whole process. Also had a great team that worked with her.  They were always on top of things and helping to get them done. This is my first home using Jenny but my second time using Realty Concepts. Every one is awesome. Thank you all for your hard work. Thank you Jenny for helping me to find my home.<//Review>< Pics>

Andrew McEwen is amazing! He’s thorough, professional and so well versed in the real estate market. He was with me every step of the way and he made the process of purchasing my first home a breeze! I am so thankful to him and the team he put together for me to make my dreams of becoming a first time home buyer come true! I highly recommend his services and will continue to work with him on all future real estate endeavors!!! I am so thankful to have worked with an agent that didn’t just try to sell me a home. He made sure I was happy, informed and ready to buy! The home we found was just right for me!</review>

<review>I appreciated Sheila’s professionalism and patience!
She showed me plenty of different houses, and when I finally settled on one, she helped me through the buying process, which can be confusing because it’s an important transaction that is unfamiliar to most people. She was always available and was quick to respond. Very easy to work with.

Melissa was such a pleasure to work with from the very beginning to the end. Although the housing market has been tough, Melissa always seemed to have a pulse on what was happening and was always one step ahead. She found us a home that we absolutely adore and we couldn’t be happier. She was very personable, responsive, & walked us through the many questions we had and always kept our best interest in mind. Thank you to Melissa and Realty Concepts for this amazing experience!< /Review>

What a great and professional people and service. As a first time home buyer with no experience, I was stressed and worried about the whole process. PAT the agent who worked with me from the beginning was very very patient, helpful and on it. He understood I was a first time buyer and calmed me and walked me through the process kindly. PAT not only answered my calls late at night but he also had to make sure we were happy and satisfied with our experience. He truly treated us with care like a family member and when we finally saw the dream home we wanted, we informed him and he went on and beyond to make sure we get it and we did!!

To my agent Pat and the whole Realty Concepts team, thank you very much for the professionalism and care you show and do.<//Review>

My husband and I worked with Karina Cooke during our move to Fresno from the east coast for work. Neither of us had even been to Fresno before and working with Karina made the whole process much easier. She was very responsive, listened to what were dealbreakers for us and the (very specific!) area we wanted. She even went and looked at houses, took videos and sent them to us so we could virtually tour homes before being able to travel out to Fresno. We ended up in the perfect house for us in the location we wanted and I know it would not have happened without her help every step of the way. I cannot recommend her enough!</Review>

<Text>Jeff Zimmerman was my agent for purchasing a long term flip, college house for my son with RV parking for me.  Our requirements eliminated 90% of the listings, but Jeff was able to find us multiple homes to preview and eventually the right house for us.  This was in an extremely "hot" sellers market where houses sold in less than a week for over asking price.  I really enjoyed working with Jeff and would use him again.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x8094681684776ac5:0x103186571293ef1b</GmapID></record>

<review>The entire process of selling a house is, by its very nature difficult as well as stressful. My agent, Bill Kellar and his people at Realty Concepts made the process as stress-free as it could be.

Bill was always there ready to assist in whatever needed to be done whether it being helping me move things out of the house, moving things into the house, minor repairs, cleaning up  etc. and he was always willing to do this and assist no matter the time of day.

Bill was truly the definition of a professional in every sense of the word, the type of professional that has become more and more difficult to find in our modern society.

Without a doubt, I would recommend him wholeheartedly and without any reservations.</review><Response>None< /Response><time>1620345605822</time></record></dataset><record>

Charlene was extremely; professional, attentive, knowledgeable, and upbeat! She was always upfront and one step ahead with all areas of our Sell. Even with difficulties that arose, mid way through she never strayed from the goal or got discouraged. She even kept in contact with us on her Vacation. She always made us feel like we were her only client and #1 priority. We thoroughly enjoyed working with her and Realty Concepts top notch procedures.<//review>

<Date>1619627997961< /Date><rating>5<//rating><Text>and Jack are excellent real estate agents. They priced my house appropriately which was a little difficult as there weren't comparable comps around my house. I had 5 offers after the 1st open house. They walked me through the offers and when the first guy got cold feet we moved on to the second who decided to back out as they could not eventually rent out house. The 3rd offer they negotiated to both parties agreement. They stayed on top of the process and I would say this is the easiest sell I've had even with the multiple hurdles and challenges in today's market. I highly recommend this team if you want to sell or buy a house!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x8094681684776ac5:0x103186571293ef1b<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

He always kept us in the loop, great communication. He understood exactly what we were looking for and never made us feel pressured to do anything. He even helped us find appliances and movers. He helped us surprise our kids once we knew the house was ours. He was always friendly and patient and we trusted him completely. If you’re looking for an honest and amazing real estate agent, call Douglas. My hubby & I can’t thank you enough.< /Text>< pics>

Me and my fiancé were searching for a house for months with a different realtor. After months of disappointment we switched to this company. Our realtor Bob worked wonders and got us Into the house of our dreams in a matter of weeks. Bobs experience and knowledge is unmatched. On top of that he is a great man and very personable I’ve grown to see him as more of a friend than a realtor.< /text>

Sherri and Jack were simply amazing. They showed us a number of houses and were always ready to listen to what we were looking for. When we finally chose our new dream home, they worked tirelessly to stay on top of details, keep us informed, and make sure that things closed in a timely manner. To say their service was personal is an understatement. The next time anyone I know needs to buy or sell a property, I will not hesitate to recommend Realty Concepts, and ask for Sherri and Jack DuBeau.<//text>

We had the pleasure of working with Trina Craft, she went above and beyond for our family! She answered every question in detail and quickly, offered her guidance and was never pushy or impatient! Trina also made sure we understood everything as the timelines progressed in both the sale of our home and the purchase of the new house. She never hesitated to reach out to contractors or assist us in any way needed. I'm glad we found her, she made the stressful process of buying and selling so much easier and smoother!<//review>

My husband and I can not thank our realtors, Lisa and Rick Rios, enough for helping us through this journey. We are/were first time home buyers and a bit intimidated at what this process was going to look like for us. A close friend (whose opinion we highly respect) recommended them. They are a power couple and helped make this new chapter of our lives something to look forward to.
There was no pressure at anytime to choose a HOUSE. Lisa and Rick always wanted to ensure that we were finding the right HOME. We really do appreciate all the hard work and care that they put into working with us. And we would definitely work with them again and again.
Anyone looking for realtors who truly care won't go wrong in choosing to work with Rick and Lisa.</text>

She helped us navigate the offers and made sure our rights and concerns were protected. She orchestrated all of the necessary pieces including dealing with our tenants and contractors as we lived out of town. I highly recommend working with Lillian.< /Text>< pics>

Nick Estrada is your agent. This is the third home we have purchased, and we have never had an agent go so above and beyond as Nick did. His knowledge, quick thinking, problem solving and fierce commitment to his clients are unrivaled.</review>

Brenda Zavala was an unbelievable facilitator of the many steps in the process of selling one home and buying another. She was always professional, sensitive to our feelings and needs, and responsive in getting back to us by phone, text, or in person. She was proactive in providing information about what we should expect next and  knowledgeable about issues and questions as they arose. Willing to do anything necessary and always optimistic, Brenda guided us from a “meant to happen” Open House meeting through a long, rather complicated escrow and into a perfectly beautiful new home. You should be very happy to have her on the Realty Concepts team and are wise to have she and Stephen Smith as “partners” because their skills complement each other’s perfectly. We definitely plan to contact Brenda and Stephen in the future when we need to list my 102 year old mother’s home. It was a pleasure to work with Realty Concepts and all associated professionals who made a quick sale of one house  and happy purchase of another into true realities!< /text>

<Review>My experience with Realty Concepts begins with Lillian P.  She was courteous and respectful of my time from the onset, and knowledgeable and professional throughout the process.  Her innate knowledge of the local area, being a resident herself, enabled my wife and i to get a good understanding of what we were getting into with our new mountain lifestyle.  She was a fierce negotiator on our behalf having secured additional perks and benefits we did not anticipate.  She made us comfortable by providing lots of information on the local community, utilities, and local handymen.  i am glad we chose Lillian to be "our gal" and would recommend her to family and friends.

<name>Muhammad Shoaib Khan</name><Time>1619379617785< /Time><rating>5<//rating><review>"Meeting David Englert was the best first step in buying my first house".

I met David Englert with RC one year ago with my mother when he showed us around town to find the best places to live and potentially buy a house. With the pandemic effecting our ability to look for houses, we decided to find a comfortable apartment while we wait for things to open and become a bit safer. David helped us throughout this process, helping us find the apartment and also showing my wife and I around town to see what Fresno had to offer. My mother, wife and I were very impressed by the customer service that David offered during this time. Finally, earlier this year, with a raging housing market, intense competition for the fewer listed houses we started our search. David was extremely kind in helping us, as first time home buyers, understand the whole process. He offered experienced suggestions, helpful insights and pros/cons of different options. He was well supported by his partner, Cherry Englert with RC throughout this process. Together they were not only able to help us find the perfect home despite of our second best offer, they also provided recommendations and referrals to help set up our new home. We are extremely grateful to know both of them and call them our friends. I would recommend their services to anyone looking for a house in the Valley area without reservations.</review>< Pictures>

My fiancé and I were first time homebuyers, and they made the process very easy, and not scary or overwhelming like first time home buying can be. Our agent, Jenny Toste, was beyond helpful and made the process seamless. We had all the questions, and she made sure to answer every single one of them, and she made us feel comfortable, confident and excited about the whole process. I highly recommend Jenny and the Realty Concepts team for any and all home purchasing or selling.<//Review>< pictures>

We worked with Jennifer Reda and if you are looking for an agent, she is the person you can trust! She was so patient and knowledgeable about EVERYTHING! Any questions we had, she either had the answer or found it for us. Talk about trusting someone with the task of finding your dream home, Jenn is the person I will recommend 100/100 times.< /Review>

<review>Erica really impressed us with how efficient, professional and on point she was throughout the entire listing process. My wife and I knew our home would be a difficult sell due to its minimalist modern upgrades, but Erica made it happen in record time! She spared no expense in marketing our home by tapping the best for photography, virtual online home tour and multiple open house showings during stringent state mandated COVID-19 procedures. Erica negotiated multiple offers and finalized an astonishing cash offer agreement over $20,000 above the appraised home value in under 3 days! We expressed our desire to be moved out of the home ASAP and Erica had us out in less than 10 days. She made the entire process painless and always kept an open line of communication.  Our family cannot thank her enough for all her hard work!<//review><resp>None</resp></record>

Her dedication to us as clients, her knowledge and professionalism in both the buying and selling process as well as her attention to detail were second to none.  If you do not contact this office and specifically Jennifer Schantz for your Real estate needs your missing out.
Thank you for everything you have done for my wife and I. From our family to yours you are truly the best and have become  more then our agent.  Your family.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
On Jan 23rd, toured a home with our agent, a female, who was rushed out of the confirmed showing time by Realtor Dan Hawkins who was verbally aggressive with her. We reported his blatant attempt to double dip commission to his supervisor, Rick Tomasello at Realty Concepts, who aside from being an apologist for his agent, stated that they received offers way far and beyond our all cash bid (which by the way was not responded to even in backup form.) The home fell out of escrow and we were still not responded to. It closed today, Feb 5th for only $5K more than our offer. This was a blatant attempt by Rick Tomasello to deceive us and I can say I am very glad I did not play into their unethical games. DO NOT TRUST THEM.< /Review>

{'time': 1612893851646, 'text': "Albert, I'm so sorry that your offer did not pan out. I truly am sympathetic for you and all of the other buyers who are struggling to get their offers accepted right now, it's not easy. Many of our listings receive an overwhelming amount of offers, which was the scenario that you're speaking of. As the Sales Manager of Realty Concepts I provided you information that you needed to know to give you a better shot at acceptance. I informed you that there were many other offers and that you were behind. I encouraged you to make your highest and best offer, and unfortunately it sounds like you didn't improve your offer, and lost it over $5,000. I'm afraid I don't follow you when you suggest I was unethical or tried to deceive you, my intent was to help you. Dan Hawkins is a former President of the Fresno Association of Realtors and is highly respected in our industry, and I stand behind his work. I am also confirming that Realty Concepts did not represent the buyer in this transaction, as you suggested. I wish you nothing but the best of luck moving forward! - Rick Tomasello"}<//response>

Very helpful! Jason and Ryan were great. Showed us a ton of homes and were patient with us and made the experience very fun. They showed up some houses and aspects of houses we wouldn't have looked at otherwise that we ended up liking a lot. Represented us very well and put us at ease through the closing process.< /text>

Lisett Ramirez was everything I could have hoped for and MORE in an agent. Throughout every step of my home search and buying experience, she was present, energetic, helpful, and ready to jump in and get her hands dirty. Whether it was filling out unending PEADS to schedule viewings of the laundry list of homes I wanted to see, helping me come up with fair yet competitive offers, scheduling appraisal and inspections, helping me find a property management company for my existing home, helping me find a handy man, communicating with my loan officer, or even locate boxes, Lisett was there and happy to help. There was not a single thing that I would ask of her that she didn't do her very best to deliver. Her presence and knowledge of our current housing market was instrumental in my home search and made the purchasing/escrow process ridiculously smooth and stress free. Literally every step of the process just seemed to fall nicely into place and I know that that was the result of all of Lisett's hard work and attention to detail. I fully intend on referring her to all of my friends and family.</review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Our realtor was very open and honest throughout our sale of my home. She was very knowledgeable on expectations from what clients were looking for in a home. From start to finish she was in communication with us. She went well beyond expectations. She insured my home was locked and alarm set after each showing. She even took out the trash cans out and brought back in when we were out of town.

Can't say enough about my experience with Realty Concept without writing a book.

<Text>I've worked with a number of real estate agents over the years, and my experience with Erin Anderson of Realty Concepts has been the most pleasant, efficient, and professional business relationship I've experienced. Erin shows that she cares about her clients and is determined to meet their needs - she never pressures you, she is always willing to take the time, as much  time as needed, to discuss potential properties, and her advice is sound. If you decide to make an offer or sell a property - I've done both with her - she's on it right away, and the transaction goes smoothly. She's also an empathetic and thoughtful person who gives her clients the sense she is interested in them as human beings, and she is careful to make sure you're comfortable when you're doing business. I will always call her when I have any real property business in Fresno.</Text><GmapID>0x8094681684776ac5:0x103186571293ef1b</GmapID><Rate>5</Rate>< user_name>

Our experience was great. Drew McEwen was super attentive, kept us well-informed throughout the entire process, and took a lot of the stress out of selling our home. My husband and I both work full time and we have two small children, so we were really nervous about whether we could take this on right now, but Drew made it easy!< /Text>

Joni is very professional and passionate about what he does. He is willing to work with you and help in any way possible. He is ready to make the move whenever his clients are ready and not the other way around. It has been a pleasure to work with him throughout the process. He is willing to explain everything and anything when in doubt and he is very well at communicating back and forth with you. He is also very respectful of your time and decisions, willing to work with you at all times, and very knowledgeable of the business. Our recommendations go far and beyond from high. He eases the entire process of buying a house from beginning to end. His bilingual skills are also great and we would communicate with him in English and Spanish. We are very grateful we had the opportunity to work with him. Thank you Joni.< /Review>

Pat is the MAN!
He has gone above and beyond in helping us get this house.
As usual he provided excellent advise and information, he is very knowledgeable of the area. Even after the closing, he ensures everything is what we expected and makes sure you are happy with your new home.

Thank You Pat, you ARE our family realtor and friend.

We worked with Deanna DiMuro to find our new home. Excellent Realtor! She showed us all around the Fresno/Clovis area so we really got a feel for the neighborhoods and tailored the showings to what we were looking for!<//text>

Jason and Ryan worked seamlessly together to help me market and sell my father's estate home from out of state. They were skilled with probate matters, helping me to navigate state law and working closely with my attorney to make the process smooth, without sacrificing value. They are well connected to local real estate community and have powerful resources at hand. Energetic, knowledgeable, efficient. I strongly recommend them.</Review>

We worked with Jennifer Reda on the sale of our home.  Not only did she sell our home quickly and for a great value, she is exceptionally friendly and outgoing. She was on top of all the details throughout each step in the process and kept our minds at ease. We would highly recommend Jennifer and Realty Concepts.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Kat Hargrove went above and beyond the call of real estate agent duty! Kat stepped up and handled/coordinated necessary details so that the house absolutely sparkled. Within four days of being on the market we had an offer above asking price with a back up cash offer. Kat has an excellent eye with staging a home and her choice in color(s) is stunning. Selling a home can be emotional, and in my case it was extra emotional. Kat's sensitivity and patience while I sorted through my experience is a rare attribute in a human and in particular for a real estate agent. Kat is a rock star and when it is time for me to buy another home, she's my gal!<//Text><UserId.>113107684413444678675<//UserId.><Name>Louise Bauer Davoli< /Name><Response>None</Response><Time>1552405423927</Time><Gmap_id>0x8094681684776ac5:0x103186571293ef1b</Gmap_id></record>

My realtor is a gem. Kerry was patient with us in finding the perfect home and was always always available when we needed her. She made sure we had every detail we needed and she truly made us feel like family. Once we found our house, she helped us get everything done to move in and close in 16 days!!! Can’t say enough good things about Reality Concepts and the caliber and character of its realtors.<//Text>

<Review>My agents, Lisa and Rick Rios were amazing. From the very start they listened and were so proactive. Within days, they had a broker open house and when it came to the open house for potential buyers they took the extra step to provide loan senerios. Not once did I have to follow up on anything. They are a great example of what it’s like to work with people that make you feel that they care more about you than themselves.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Our realtor, Cathie Jensen went the extra mile to make sure everything was presentable and that all last-minute items were addressed.  She was very responsive to emails and texts and kept us informed with meticulous detail.  Our place was in escrow within 2-months and closed on time with no issues.<//Text>

The only thing I did not like about the process was that the seller's agent, same company, tried multiple times to convince me to change my lender, which, in my opinion, is a bit intrusive.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Lisa was AMAZING! My boyfriend and I were just done looking at houses in Visalia and weren't impressed. So sitting in our car outside the hotel we looked on Zillow for any other listings in the area before heading back to the Bay Area and this listing popped up! It was beautiful and just what we were looking forAND in our price range closer to the Bay too! So instead of sending a message and waiting,.I just up and called Lisa. Not like me, and hadn't really done that before. We had been looking on Zillow for almost 4 months and saw a few houses. Anyway she answered right away..... and to our surprise she said if you could meet us at the property in 20-30 minutes we could take a tour. WOW!!!!! We pulled up and they were there and ready to show us. They were upfront about everything! Showing us any problem and walking/talking and taking through each step. Each room. Any problems and let me tell you the house was just as BEAUTIFUL as the pictures. That's rare lol
I just love how down to earth and knowledgable she was about everything. I swear right when we met and saw the house.... my bf and I knew it had to be ours. And now we are HOME OWNERS thanks to Lisa and her family company
She responds quickly and is always helpful with advice.  5 out of 5 stars!!! She really works with you. You never feel like just another client. I will recomend Lisa to anyone looking to buy a home. here for sure!

thank you so much Lisa for all your hard work!!</review>< Rate>

My realtor was Damon who was recommended to me by a friend. He took an entire day to drive me around town as I was new to the area, showed me every part of town, made recommendations, have me some history and answered every one of my questions. He moved fast once I had decided on a house and kept me updated throughout the process and even got me quotes for repairs. He also tried very hard to work with the seller on some potential issues.</Text>

I'll keep it short.  Our agent, Erin Anderson, was fantastic.  Took care of every minor detail, helped transfer our solar loan to the new buyer, helped take care of the HERO loan as well and was on top of each step of the process.  Could not have gone smoother, would have been a nightmare without her.</review>

Words cannot express how deeply appreciative my husband and I are for Miss Cindi Bauer. She was over the top best person we have ever worked with during such a stressful time in our lives. She had just the right amount of patience, eagerness, and communication skills for the job. My husband and I were extremely beaten down by the past representative/situations concerning buying a home , but the fact that she did EXACTLY what we asked and worked to get just that, was the best feeling ever. She knew we were anxious and in yet she always stayed level headed, calm, and positive. It was an absolute pleasure to work with Miss Bauer. We wish her all the success in the world. Thank you for making our dreams come true.< /Text>

< Review>
I purchased a home through Tom and would not hesitate to call him should I ever consider selling; Tom's follow-through and consideration as I traversed the sometimes erratic road of finding a house I wanted to purchase, making the offer,  negotiation and final sale was refreshing and greatly appreciated.  When it came time to make the initial offer Tom was first to say he wanted to do comps of other like homes in the area, which is not something other agents have done willingly, in my experience.  Tom remembered comments I had made about homes he had shown me, and was patient when I was getting discouraged and looking to just "settle" on a house rather then wait and find the right house.  Tom answered every question, sometimes the same question a few time, with more than patience but with genuine understanding of the ups and downs of buying a home.  Tom was there with names of reputable service people to determine cost of repairs, and who have proved to be worthy of his trust; this has made preparation to move into the home invaluable in addition to     making reasonable negotiation possible.  What more can I say?  Tom is the kind of Real Estate Agent who seems to genuinely like what he is doing and likes his clients.<//Review>

<Text>My Man JT, was the best. Im sure everyone in this firm is great as well, however! JT was on it. Every time i had a question he eaither already had the answer or was able to provide it quickly. Guys busy so he didnt always pick up but quickly responded with a text and just a few short minutes later he was on the phone. Now the Best part, when i needed to fix things to sell he not only had a guy but he called and booked/scheduled them super fast, allowing me to spend more time worrying about the moving process, and he sold my house OVER Appraisal VALUE. Id give 100 Stars of i could.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

If you're planning on buying in the Oakhurst or Coarsegold area, THIS is where you need to go. Especially if you're a dumb blonde like me, they are SO helpful and knowledgeable with the entire process. Our agent Lillian helped us to find the perfect home and we couldn't be more grateful!</Text>

< Review>
Really great Customer Service. I got the opportunity to work with Fernando Razo, one of the Realtors. He was awesome! Always answered my texts and returned my calls no matter what time of day it was. I had worked with other realtors before, but they were not willing to take me to different counties or work with my schedule. I tried looking for a home for over 8 months, but when I finally worked with Fernando after about a month I found my home. I would highly recommend this realty company especially if all realtors are like Fernando. Thank you.</Review>

Bob and Colleen Wiginton, at Realty Concepts,  were the BEST!  I was so blessed to have had them as my realtors.  They represented me both in selling my house and buying a new one.  They walked me through each step.  When I was getting too many e-documents to read and sign, I called them.  They had the documents sent to them and read through them for me.  Since I trusted them completely, that was a big help to me!  In selling my house, they knew just the right timing; they helped me create an environment that buyers would love.  Then, their photographer beautifully captured my home, inside and out. The pictures were posted on Zillow and similar sites.  They knew exactly what price to list the house.  My home sold in three days, over asking price, even before the open house.  They continued to represent me through the building of my new home.  They answered each of my texts and phone calls and assured me I wasn’t being a pain, although, I think I may have been.  If you want realtorswith integrity and expertise to represent you as a buyer and/or seller, Bob and Colleen Wiginton are without parallel!<//review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>Perfect place, perfect ambience! I visited this library a few months back and I was very much impressed with its location, lighting, pleasing atmosphere, available topics and arrangement of books, ease of location and access, nice seating, all make it a beautiful library that you feel you should visit often. The registration is very simple and immediate that you can start borrowing number of books and videos at once. You have books on all topics, say, Fiction, non- Fiction, technical, political, educational and so on. You can browse through monitors and make a choice on author or title. This is a free library.
I was surprised to see that there are books on Indian languages like Tamil too.
You have video section too serving movie buffs and others. Number of DVDs and Blu-ray  movies, starting from age old 60's to modern day wait for you to grab. They have latest too. I was delightd to see some old movies too in their collection. There are interesting topics on non-fiction too.
You have facilities for copying, reading leisurely, self ticketing to borrow etc. Rest rooms are good. Parking is very nearby.
The staff are friendly and helpful. You can extend the books on line if required.
This library has kid section too, which is a plus point. While the reading habits are slowly coming down, the introduction of books to children  at an early age is a must to search and gain knowledge instead of digital hunting, Copy-Paste attitude.
Another thing I should mention is the beautiful architecture of the building. Lovely and invites you to visit.
The authorities should be appreciated for all their efforts in maintaining this treasure house of books in excellent condition. Hats off to them!

Awesome library! They have great workshops . I attended the LinkedIn for entrepreneurs and small businesses and also they had a free photo taken event where they take your photo for free for your LinkedIn profile. They also welcome residents from other cities. I  stop by  the Rivermark plaza where the library is located after work for my snacks but don't actually live in the area.<//Review>

The library is very well organized and located in a great place besides the Rivermark plaza. The staff is nice and prompt. Parking space is a bit limited, as well as book selection, but that is easily solved by requesting books from other libraries to be delivered there.<//Review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>The facilities are great and the desks, computers are all new. But in my personal view, a library should be a place where people can read, study, or do other academic work in peace.

However, it is TOTALLY the opposite here. It is so loud. Children run around, occasionally shouting, and parents seems to think that is totally okay. This place is more a day care than a library.

I wish the staff could advise the parents more heavily to remind their children that they are in a library, not a playground.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>Great. The place where I love to go every time I can.

There are lot of things anyone can appreciate about library.
Its location is just perfect. Located in river mark market place. You can get almost everything here. Even you might seeking for hair saloon or dentist or cuisine or Safeway or what. Behind library there is big playground too. Parking near library is plus point.
Available facilities are so high that you will overwhelm with those. One day I was asking for librarians that how much books I can take at a time. I was shocked with answer and ask her again. I was not able to believe on my ears. She said 60.
You can renew any book online. There is online catalog available too. Plus anybody can request to HOLD book. Even you can check availability of book. It will give you name of the branch where book is. Reminder for book renewal from library. 2-3 days before. There are always lot of social events going on in library. One can register for it online.
My most favourite part, why I go library every time is for kids. Yes. There is seperate area for kids. Lot of books for toddlers too. Almost on every friday they have story time at 10.30am. Family story time. If its not,  they will update on events calendar. There are many events organised by library for different age groups of kids and adults too. Story time is the best time. My daughter and I both love it.
About the architecture and all it is just perfect. Areas are segregated as per adult and children. Fiction and nonfiction etc. Water fountain, washrooms eveything is available. Copy machine too. Self check out is also there. Many computers provide express check out. Charging point on every table. Group study rooms are there. You can book. One can use library screen for work or search purpose. Behind main library there is some open space. Where you can park  stroller and rest on benches over there.
There are lot of positive thing one must share about this library.  I must say thank you to all  librarians who help me everytime I go there, in everything I need.<//text>< pics>

But there are a few areas for improvement: 1) small isles make both book searching and reading at the desk a challenge; 2) there's not enough QUIET zone for reading, more desks on the children reading section than adult side; 3) there's no shades in the garden which makes the space a white elephant.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808fc975895448cd:0x485e82470495f7e1<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>THE GOOD: It's convenient to be able to reserve books and have them available for pick up here because it's so close to my home. It seems to have a lot of community events. The staff is friendly and helpful.

THE CAN'T BE HELPED: The book selection here is pretty limited, which is to be expected since it's so small.

THE BAD: It's incredibly noisy. Apparently, libraries are no longer a quiet haven for readers and students but a place for noisy children to run around unattended. Serious negative points for this.<//Text><rate>3< /rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Date>

Basically Indian day care. Lots of parents bring their kids here and let them cry and be loud. No one, not even the staff, has the decency to enforce a quiet atmosphere. It kind of defeats the purpose of a library if they let it turn into a day care.</Text>

Story time is just sad when the branch manager is leading. She has no idea how to work with toddlers and make it fun.  Soon after ir starts she loses her patience because kids are not interested in her boringness and it just becomes a mess. I wish she would get a clue and have the other people (like Angela) run story time since she clearly is not cut out for the program.</text>

Public libraries are the last place where people with no/few resources can gain the knowledge and skills to compete with people with much higher resources. Investment in public libraries have way more multiplier effects and lead to social mobility than investment in roads and fancy buildings. This is especially true in Silicon Valley where the high cost of living keeps people with low resources out. Incumbents will always try to increase the barrier to entry and to create monopolies, and it will protect their interests in the short term. However in the long term, these incumbents who try to build barriers to entry will drive the innovators away to Texas or Boston with much lower cost of living, leading to lower innovation and SV will die a slow death. You as public libraries have this opportunity to lower the barrier to entry and drive innovation and growth in SV more than any other entity, if you chose to take on this role.</Review></record>

Its overall good but the time  schedule could do a little work like Wednesday Thursday and Friday close at 6 pm and while Monday and Tuesday close 8pm and my family always gets confused and not that much time so could make it close at 8pm always?< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) It is a really good library.
It is a library that feels like family and children come together rather than quietly studying. You should think of it as white noise, like studying in a cafe.
If you don't want to rent a book even if you just visit, you can go in and study right away. Some small books are sold, so you can buy used books at low prices.

정말 좋은 도서관 입니다.
조용히 공부를 하기보다는 가족과 아이들이 함께 오는 느낌의 도서관 입니다. 카페에서 공부하듯이 백색 소음이라고 생각해야 할것 같습니다.
그냥 방문하여도 책을 대여할것이 아니라면 바로 출입해서 공부를 할 수 있습니다. 작게 책을 파는 곳도 있어서 싼가격에 중고 책도 구입할 수 있습니다.</Text>< name>

I have been coming here since I was very young. They rescue injured wildlife, it can't get any better than that! They provide lots of educational tools and content to help people understand about local wildlife. Helpful volunteers that love to teach and share information. Always a great experience even if it's just stopping by to say hi to Lord Richard.< /Review>

<Text>It Truly Sucks That This Is Happening and This Place Is Closed Due To Covid-19. I'm Working At Kirker Creek Apartments in Pittsburg, CA. And A Resident Brought To My Attention A Baby Bird That Has A Serious Broken Leg 💔 I Called Animal Patrol and There Is Nothing They Can Do and Suggested This Place. I Need Help Or Some Kind Of Soul To Help Me Care For and Help Me Get This Bird Back In The Air. Look At These Pictures and Tell Me What I Should Do....😩😩<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvJ6KzqPm5rn3Y4F2dutcJtg9sGqOxMkghmmyK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaFLeKmHrVudaQHyMf3Wuhmt09EwRu_wBFpCJ1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>
{'time': 1619233389958, 'text': "If you can please bring that bird back to the Lindsay hospital tomorrow from 10a-3p. Call this number (925) 659-8156 to make sure they can take the bird. Meanwhile, keep the bird overnight in a large, brown grocery sack or a cardboard box. Don't feed it. It will be fine without food overnight. And keep it in a quiet place. Hope this helps."}<//Response>

Small but exciting! Lots of different wildlife exhibits with an assortment of interesting animals to learn about. Two separate kids' play areas (a pretend "vet" spot and a place for smaller kids with blocks and books). Clean bathrooms, helpful and friendly staff, overall a great place to take small children. Not very crowded early on the weekend. The parking lot is small, but the Experience borders a large open park with 2 play structures and a public pool that also has a kids' splash park in it.< /Review>

The place is small but pack with different things. It kept my 11 year old very engaged but my 8 and 5 year old did not stay entertained as long. The place has a natural history area with stuffed animals, preserved bird and insects, mineral exhibit, and more.l downstairs. Upstairs they have many exhibits with animals to see like birds, porcupines, snakes, roadrunner, rats, and more. While we were there they had a person showing off a gopher snake that the kids could touch. They have shows but do to the times it did not work into our schedule. We were able to get free passes for two of us through Discovery Go with my library card. There is a nice park with playground and grass area outside.< /Text>

A nice place for toddlers & little kids to visit and explore. Price is fairly. We used our CDM membership for discounted tickets. Easy parking. There is an additional parking lot across the street, provided by the church. The staffs do a great job on taking care of animals and keep the environment clean. Amazing!!!< /Text>

<Text>We brought a feather in for identification today that we found in our backyard. We have always loved visiting this place, but they went above and beyond this trip. They worked with my son to identify it (turned out to be a turkey) and he was absolutely thrilled. We ended up donating the beautiful specimen. Wonderful place with equally wonderful people.<//Text>< user_id>

Awesome place to go to but it is pretty pricey for what you get. However I would recommend every local person attend, it is amazing the work they do for the animals. There is a behind the scenes vet room, you can see many birds of prey up close. There are all sorts of critters in nice cages, play room, animal make believe stuff, movie documentaries, experts, opportunities to touch certain animals. They had a porcupine the last time we went in August 2018. I love the owls, they're my favorite! There's also an eagle, pretty awesome! All the animals are rescued, many are returned back to the wild, but the ones who can't survive are kept here or sent to a zoo.
There is also a really nice park attached to it called Larkey Park. There are bathrooms inside the facility, they are nice, and drinking water. Outside there are also bathrooms as you walk down the path toward the park. There is also a walking trail that heads out from the park, too. And there is an amazing swimming pool and splash area. So if you want to come for the day you can bring a whole picnic thing, water gear, and some cash and you'll have an amazing fun day!<//Text>

They have an outdoor "raptor recess" area where they take the raptors out for daily exercise. They also have an indoor exhibit where the birds of prey stay, and also other animals like a porcupine, opossum, rabbit, etc. They have a theater room with one way glass so you can watch a part of their animal hospital, and other daily activities. I would definitely check the website or call ahead to see what they have when, so you can go when they have the activities you want to see. This is also home to the oldest living turkey vulture known in captivity. Great place to take the kids, and lots of fun/cool stuff in the gift shop.< /review>< Rate>

<Review>They put on special animal encounters that you have to sign up for online. It's not something you can just show up for due to limited space. With that in mind this place is a real treat. Everyone is really helpful and the displays are interactive. There is extra parking across the street at the church.<//Review>< date>

Awesome place to observe and learn about local wildlife, especially raptors. Lots of hands on exhibits for kids, including petting some of the creatures like the porcupine, snakes, rabbits, etc. Also, the staff are all super friendly and knowledgeable. A local gem!<//text>

Great place. You can see various animals from real close and even touch some of them. People working there are very nice and helpful.</Review>

This is a great place to see rehabilitated animals that would not necessarily survive on their own in the wild. We saw owls, hawks, an entire active bee hive, snakes, rabbits, guinea pigs, a porcupine, and an eagle.

Plus if you’re lucky enough to be part of a tour of the hospital side, you can also see animals that are being nursed back to health for release back into the wild.< /text>

Always a great place to take the kids. Although at the age of 4 my girls still have an issue completely seeing  some of the exhibits, they have to step on their tippy toes or be picked up. The exhibits consist of the surrounding wildlife life birds, reptile and rodents. I particularly enjoy the see though behive, they have a bird flying simulator and a live informational exhibition telling about the different animals they take care of. There are many volunteers around to explain to you about the many animals in detail. And after you can take your kids to the park only steps aways.< /Review>

Wonderful experience for adults and kids. It is a rescue hospital for wild animals and that part you cannot see but they have Ambassador animals on exhibit which are animals that can't be returned to the wild for various reasons that you can see and observe. How are age range was 6 and 1/2 to 72 years old. We all had a great time< /text>

Awesome place to teach kids love and care for nature and wildlife. Something to do for all ages. Small kids will enjoy rabbits and Guinea pigs, older will like birds and operation room. Multiple workshops throughout the day. Plenty of parking. Gift shop.</text>

For the relatively low cost of admission (refer to other admission prices in the Bay Area), this institution is actually really good. The talks with the docents and animal handlers are quite nice! But some of the exhibits need repair, as do the kids books and play toys. Some exhibits just need more content.<//Text>

Great and affordable place to take the kids for an afternoon. My son really enjoyed seeing the unique animals up close, and the staff is so friendly and always willing to answer your questions and tell you more about the animals. It also sits on a great park and playground with lots of green space to run around, and multiple play structures for different ages of kids.</review>

Even though it breaks my heart to know most of these birds will never recover enough to go back into the wild being able to see them so up close really allows you to to appreciate the intricate beauty they poses.  A great education experience for all.</Review>

Lovely to see all these beautiful animals. We even watched a small presentation about salamanders which was educational and fun. I am definitely coming back and bringing my husband (he is jealous he missed out!). They have many different types of owls and hawks.< /text>< Pictures>

This place is pretty overrated. It's nice for any kid under 5 but you really can be in and out of there within 5 minutes and that to me just isn't worth paying for. Definitely not a place I'd recommend to anyone without children.<//Text>

I took a foundling sick baby bird, a large bird...to their wildlife hospital. They took him in to try to save the poor creatures life. I was very distraught when I arrived.  They made me feel like it was going to be ok, I had done all I could do, now they would take care of it. It was a wild bird & not doing at all well. It is in Gods hands. I prayed & w/a place like this to help w/no charge to me, is very wonderful.
Thank you

This is a great place for anyone who appreciates nature, especially if you want to learn more. Watching the veterinarians in action is one of the coolest things you can do there, but I love raptors so the close-up views of all their "ambassadors" (a group of birds of prey, mostly owls, that are permanent residents at the museum due to their inability to fly) is my favorite part. It's also great for little kids, and the price is very reasonable!</Review>

<review>Small local wildlife rescue and display museum. It's ideal for an hour visit during hot or cold days. They have birthday rooms and special events. The gift shop has lots of interesting and informational books and games. The general admission is too expensive for a one day experience. It's best to get a family membership.</review><Date>1573336674299</Date><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

The wonderful volunteers at the hospital kindly stayed opened past 7pm because I called and told them I had found baby Scrub Jay that was hurt and fell out of the nest.  I really appreciate their help!  The baby bird really needed help and I'm so glad they were there do just that.</Text>

<Review>I went to the Lindsay Wildlife Rehabilitation Hospital to take a injured reptile. They were very helpful and caring to the animal. Since it was a wildlife and native to California I could not keep it as a pet to care for, so they took care of it and nursed it back. LWRH gave me a number to call so I can check up on how the animal was doing. I donate to them always to help them out, I encourage others to do the same< /Review>< time>

<Text>This wildlife area exceeded our expectations! We've been to a similar wildlife area in the past from our hometown, but this was amazing! They had several different live birds on show, but don't worry, these birds are only there because they cannot live in the wild. They also take care of several injured animals around the area, which you can see by going into their museum. Definitely worth the small amount we spend (I thought it was ~10 bucks a person).< /Text>< Pics>

What a great community resource. Most of the animals and birds have rich stories of how they came to the museum. The raptor demonstrations are very informative and exciting. The behind the scenes at the animal hospital, is very cool. We saw the techs feeding baby birds. The entry fee goes to caring for the injured animals!< /Review>

Where else, other than Hogwarts, can you see so many gorgeous owls? The owls are my favorite but there are also other raptors including a bald eagle, snakes, possums and more, all native California creatures that have been rescued due to injury or other issues. It's relatively small, but very accessible for the younger set. The interactive exhibits were especially popular with the 3-10 year olds. The 3 and 5 year olds with me really enjoyed the veterinary dress up area where they engaged in an extended imaginative play session. They also have really interesting presentations throughout the day. While we were there we watched volunteers and a vet do the health intake exam on a family of baby squirrels whose nest had fallen from a tree. It's attached to a nice park with a playground and plenty of room for picnicking. If you find a wild bird or creature in distress this is the place to take them!</text>

The museum was good. But had a bad experience at the hospital. I will never bring anything I rescue to that hospital ever again. They decided to euthanize these healthy animals without letting us know. No one has the right to play GOD but he himself.<//Text>

This was a  Awesome experience and a great place to go visit if you want to explore birds and different other kind of animals. They do let you experience the birds up front and life and they do demonstrate things at the birds can do and educate you on what the bird is And their background where they came from. But yes an awesome place for children in a very pleasing education for grown UPS.</Review>

They have live owl’s and do a great job of interacting with kids with workshops and classes.

Cool education place to bring babies and young children, especially when it's cold and rainy. There is always a "talk" by one of the volunteer wildlife ambassadors educating the kids about the local wildlife and the differences between wildlife and pets.  Beware: The volunteers do feed the birds dead mice and other things while speaking.

In the Exhibit hall is on one floor and is small. You can easily see everything in one hour. but can stay longer for each "talk" (one per 30 minutes to an hour). There is a bird area that there are live birds and owls sitting above the glass enclosed bird habitats, which you think are stuffed because the birds don't move at all.

Lots of interactive exhibits for kids of all ages to engage and learn from. The active bee hive is very cool by the window - the bees come in and out from outside and go into the clear "hive" to made honey.

There are live snakes, bunny, guinea pig, mice, rat, possum and a tarantula to look at. Lindsay is also an active wildlife rehabilitation hospital for the East Bay and offers wildlife education programs and camps starting at the age of 2 through teens throughout the year at very reasonable rates.

Another great value, become a annual Lindsay member and you can also get in free or get a 50% discount to visit six Bay Area science attractions, including Oakland Zoo, and more than 300 across the United States.

Diaper changing table in the women's restroom. Tiny-sized elevator to get up to the Exhibit Hall. In a residential neighborhood, Lindsay has access to additional free parking across the street at the church's parking lot.<//Text>

Wonderful small museum for animal lovers.  It is not big but they have special programs almost every half an hour and talks about different kind of birds and environment topics.  My boy is nine and he loves animals and he had a lot of fun during the four hours at the musuem.  It is an hour drive for us to get here.  It is completely worthy it.< /text>

<text>Excellent place to bring kids for a "field trip". Even fun for adults. I had the opportunity to be a volunteer a few years ago, and even though I was doing laundry and food dishes and cage cleaning, it was fun. The best part was feeding the animals. I got to feed a baby raccoon and we fed little birds 3 times a shift. This place is a hidden gem. If you find an injured bird or animal, they must be native to California. If not, they have to euthanize them. Call them if you do find an injured and they will usually tell you at that time whether they can treat or not.< /text>< pictures>

Lindsay is a great little place for families with young children. I feel confident letting my toddler develop her independence, knowing that she is within eyesight. She enjoys seeing the animals and even asks about them by name! Its worth getting a membership.</review>

Lindsay is a great little place for families with young children. I feel confident letting my toddler develop her independence, knowing that she is within eyesight. She enjoys seeing the animals and even asks about them by name! Its worth getting a membership.<//Review>

There were some cool and educational exhibits. (We got in for free) but I think we would have been disappointed if it had been something we paid for

Not bad, just small.<//review>

Love this place, it's great for kids. I remember it from my childhood when it was the old building. I wish everything wasn't so pricey but they do really good work for animals that wouldn't get it elsewhere so I'm at least happy knowing where my money is going. They also donated a family membership for my niece loves animals and is coming out of a traumatic situation. We really really appreciate that. Thank you Lindsay!< /text>

It's a working hospital first, a museum second. Not knowing that, it may seem uptight, but that's what a proper hospital should be. Professional medical establishments usually equate to uptight, so do not expect Disney world :)

One negative thing:

I hated to see the owls and falcons tethered to the top of shelves (they are not moved after hours).

It looked like opossum and there porcupine were a little cage crazy, but I'm not an expert on these matters. But man are some of those cages tiny.

This is a private hospital, and very well funded. But that shouldn't detract from giving the unreleasable indoor animals a little more space.< /Text>

So well done. The raptor exhibit was amazing - they're live in the open, right there. It's not overwhelming in size. My toddler likes it. Great park and playground next door. I became a member.< /Review>

They are highly educated and share this with the community at large.  The facility is clean and bright and engaging.  It is small so don't plan to spend more than 2-3 hour max most likely.  Littles get to interact with small animals and you get a glass wall view of their intake and operating room where you actually get to see it in action at scheduled times during the day.</text></record>

I absolutely loved this place and my 1 year old had a blast. I couldn't believe how close you can get to some of these animals especially the raptors. Seeing owls and hawks that close is a real treat. Staff are very friendly and accommodating, someone was always right there to explain things to us or give us little bits of information about the individual animals, this is a place for all ages and it doesn't disapoi,t in the least.< /Text>

These are wonderful people rescuing and caring for injured or orphaned wildlife. Hope the 10 baby possums are doing well that were found in my yard.< /Review>

We took our 1 year old to see the rescue animals. She got to pet the bunny rabbit and it was a lot of fun for her. The place is small and we thought we would make a day out of going here. It was more like an hour. There was a great park right behind it and we spent the rest of our afternoon there.<//Review>

It is alright. Way smaller than I imagined it. Also I was expecting more animals. But it is very cool of them to take care of injured creatures. Lot of animals exhibit were empty when I went there. I am not sure I will have the opportunity to come back. It is great for kids about 4 years old and under.< /text>

<text>Lindsay is the best wildlife rehab center around! I've taken several animals to them who were injured or orphaned and they cared for them and when possible released them back in the area they were found. Always an important aspect in Wildlife Rehabilitation.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>I have been going there for years and it is always a blast! It is only a hour or 2 of things to see and do, but it truly is a wonderful place to see the wildlife of California. Every ticket is put toward helping those animals get rehabilitated and released back into the wild. I will continue to support and visit this museum.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>Dropped off an injured bird we found. Staff was welcoming, grateful, competent, and interested in helping. Beautiful grounds are nicely kept. Outdoor enclosures were empty, though, presumably to take birds inside for the evening, which makes sense. We'll go back as there's much to see and do. Very professionally run from what we saw.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>This is not just for kids and families. If you like to see up close and learn about birds, mammals and reptiles that live in our area, this a very good place to spend a few hours.
At $7 for adults, admission is reasonable. Considering the work they do with their wildlife hospital, you should donate a little more if you can afford. Staff is friendly and knowledge. Just what I learned about foxes and raptors was worth the visit. The twice daily demonstration in the hospital area are really insightful and entertaining.< /Text><Rating>5<//Rating>< gmapID>

One of my favorite places on the planet. One of the only emergency surgical rooms in the country, Lindsay Wildlife actively takes in wild animals and nurse them back to health. They offer classes for homeschooling kids in the classrooms down stairs.  They also have volunteer opportunity's for kids starting  at age 12.< /Text>

If you like predator birds, you should enjoy this. About half of their exhibits are birds. The other half are animals that birds eat. The most impressive is the display of large birds just as you walk in.< /review>

4 stars because the hospital was ok when I dropped off a baby wildlife animal. The front desk lady wasn’t very empathetic to me when I was balling my eyes out after handing this sweet baby over. I just felt coldness and not a lot of empathy. Maybe just understand that when people come in with an animal, show some compassion.</text>

Not a very educational experience to have animals housed for exhibition it looks like another person out to make a buck. They said nothing about there contribution to there hand in the future extinction of these locked up creatures. And when talking with someone cleaning a cage I was asked to not ask questions ( talk) if it wasn't for my first graders class outing I would have left there and then I was totally embarrassed Your better off going to a zoo<//text>

Great place for the kids (and adults) to learn about the wildlife. They not only have animals on display but have keeper talks and pettings, plus animal hospital presentations and much more. They also have a nice playground for the kids outside.<//review>

<text>As animal lovers and preservation activists, my family and I could not resist visiting this place while we vacationed near SF.  Simply the most interactive animal experience we've ever had.  The guides were very informative and hands on and there were several special events throughout the building.  We had only intended on spending an hour or two here but ended up staying for the entire afternoon.<//text>< pics>

Local wildlife showcased by amazingly caring people in a loving and educational way that's fun for adults and kids. The raptors and owls perched overhead are especially amazing.</text>

Educational place to learn about wildlife through their animal ambassadors.  Great place to take the kids and a great resource if you need to bring in injured animal that needs help.</review>

One of my favorite places to visit . they help domestic animals and birds that was hurt. Its one of the best places for kids to learn and be exposed to wild life. Animals are taken good care of all resques I believe . people find them and bring them to the museum they have great staff. This is a place where you and your kids can touch a snake , pat a bunny see bees and a queen bee , look at owls , turtle , snakes. There us a room for the little ones to play . will chair accessible . You can watch how they do daily routine check ups of patients with a live explanation of their actions .
Great , great , great place please do visit ! Parking structures available , playground right on a side of the museum. Sprouts close by so you can get your groceries on the way home. Fwy close by as well as close by downtown pleasanthill and walnut creek .< /Review>

<review>Great place free fridays. Kinda small, but nice for the little ones. Parking can be tuff to find and it is kinda hard to track down assistant to ask questions about certain animals. Once you do though they are very I'm informative and so very helpful. You want to bring snacks as they don't have any place to purchase things like that. There happened to be a food truck outside when we went.  The other side offers a Animal hospital where you can bring injured wildlife.  P's they have an amazing park next door two actually and the kids love it< /review>< pictures>

It was pretty small, and there wasn't as much interactivity as I had hoped.  It's cheap though, and there is a pretty cool park next to it.<//Review>

It's extremely cool that they'll treat almost any injured animal free.  Sadly, the gopher snake I cut while digging in my yard didn't make it.<//text>

NOT THE BEST PLACE FOR PEOPLE WITH ORNITHOPHOBIA

There are some seriously cool birds inside the Lindsay Museum, and although some are in cages with glass windows, many sit tethered on top. Like the Giant Bald Eagle. And the Great Owl. It's pretty cool, though, you begin to feel a little bad for the birds. How long could I possibly sit in one spot comfortably? Hmm.

I came here a lot as a child (we lived on Larkey Lane so the park was my spot). It was in a different building then, which still sits next door and looks like it's not being used for anything. Not sure if they have storage or equipment in here but it's definitely not open to the public. I wish It were! Lots of good memories in the big building.

Lindsay has demos and hands-on interaction that your kids will enjoy. The downstairs is a large, open room and has art for sale on the wall and items like puzzles for kids to put together. It's pretty open and always surprises me that they don't do more with the space. It's fun to walk around the place from time to time but I'm sure it's a much great joy to experience this with a child. I think my favorite part of the Museum was the live bee hive with clear walls that has a tube connecting it to the outside world. We watched bees loaded with pollen come and make deliveries to their Queen. She's marked and pretty easy to find inside the hive. Really neat!

If you find a wild animal with an injury, bring it here and they'll patch it up. But if they determine the animal is too friendly, like their fox, they'll cage it up too and put it on display...which kind of sucks for Mr. Friendly Fox.< /Text>

<review>Great place, expecially for for kids. Interested things about animals and their life/habitat. Safe and nice neighborhood. Not that much parking, but ok. Next to it is the Larkey Park< /review>< rating>

When we went, the entire bottom floor was closed for a private event so we had to pay full price and were limited to the top floor only. A bit disappointing.<//review>
