<review>I wanted to write this personal note to recognize the exceptional customer service offered to me by the property manager Linda...i have been in the business of training employees in the area of sales as well as customer service for over 15 yrs... The skills and management level of her presentation of important services and money issues impressed me so very much that I had to pause and recognize Linda.  To the point of saying that I would personally give this employee a raise and a promotion for her abilities to not only save a public storage customer but most defiantly recommend other to rent space as well... Thank you Daniel Martinez< /review><Date>1618248284187</Date></record>

<Text>Havent had a problem with the facility yet but they did increase the rent on certain units am not to pleased about that. I would just like to update my review from a 4 star to a 5 star 👍 They went above and beyond to satisfy me and have great customer service. I spoke with Linda and she is very customer service oriented. Great Job Linda!< /Text>< Rating>

I didn’t want to bug her during the the covid-19 pandemic but she went out of her way to make sure I got the help I needed. One of the nicest people I’ve dealt with in Stockton!

<username>Basuri Bhakta<//username>< Review>
I wish someone had left an honest review like the one I am about to leave. It would have saved me from a loss of thousands of dollars worth of personal belongings. I've only had my storage unit for a month. Before I even moved in, the manager asked me to leave a review for her right while she was standing in front of me and before I even had an actual experience with the facility. Now after a month I'm able to leave an honest review. My unit was broken into despite it having an overlock from the facility. Inside my unit was everything I owned and 90% of it was stolen. It's obvious my stuff was stolen by another tenant since you need a code to enter through the only entrance. There is only a camera in the front by the gate and in the office, and there are no cameras anywhere near the units so there's no way to identify any robbers. Management told my friend that this is a common occurrence at this site yet you don't see that online. Management also did not do anything to help with the aftermath of the robbery and also took no responsibility for lack of security in the facility. I thought I could trust a big name like Public Storage to safely store my belongings in but it had only been a month and I lost almost everything I owned. Highly regret storing my stuff here. Would never recommend this place to anyone</Review>

I was assisted by Tianna. My appointment was not until Friday. I went in on  Tuesday she was able to accommodate me. I was greeted immediately very friendly and professional. She even suggested mattress bag for my mattress. To keep the bugs from infecting my mattress.< /review>

The power was out around the time we had to be off the property so we were stuck literally behind the gate. Melissa didn’t necessarily have to come out and help us but she did which was really refreshing. Luckily the power came back on after while and we were able to put our code in and exit. I’ve been renting at this location for quite sometime now and seen it’s share of employees come through here needless to say I’m quite happy with the staff they have working here now. The property and other customers storing here been absolutely absurd from garbage to the homeless coming in and out. Melissa and the other staff here have really done an outstanding job getting the property up and running the way it should. Thank you so much for the amazing customer service I will continue to let people know to come in and check out this location for anything anyone needs for storage.</review>< pictures>

<Text>I rented a storage unit for the first time back in September 2013. I was going through a very difficult trial at the time. When I walked into the office, I was greeted by Dee. She was very pleasant, knowledgeable, and had great customer service skills. I would definitely recommend this Public Storage facility to others because of her. I also really like the location. It was a true blessing to be able to find a individual willing to answer all of my questions and not get an attitude or become frustrated. Dee exemplifies what good customer service is all about.

P.S. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!!!</Text><Date>1394512061358< /Date>< Response>

I needed to rent a storage space in a hurry. I called the 800 customer service number and was treated very well and professionally.  They sent me an email with specific information to the March Lane location so that I could contact them directly.  I decided to stop by to get more information.  Dee was ready and willing to answer any and all of my questions.  She was very professional and courteous.  The facility was clean and organized.  It was a simple process and would recommend this location to any one who needed to rent a storage unit.<//review>

Wasn’t sure about this area because the last time we came by the property was run down.  This time we came by and the property was cleaned up and the young woman Carissa was very honest and helpful. These are my belongings and the property feels secure. Thank You for the help.</Review>

This is such a good place to get a storage. Especially when there are so many great deals online. All employees are wonderful and very friendly. One in particular is the reddish-orange haired lady. Every time I go to my storage, this lady always has a smile on her face and greets me inside and outside the office.<//Text>

<review>We rented here awhile back. Had a great experience. The grounds were always clean. The staff was always friendly and helpful, especially Dee, (I think she lives there also) was often out on the property inspecting and cleaning. I even saw her doing repair work on one of the doors in a hall way. We got reminder calls about, "rent is due, don't get the late fee!" For me this was VERY helpful. Prices were pretty much the same as anywhere else, buy add in the personal touch of staff, you have a clean and safe place to keep your belongings. We will definately recommend to all.</review>< Pictures>

I had rented with them before and so far I haven’t really wanted to go anywhere else the prices are fair and they tell you everything straight instead of trying to persuade you to go for the better deals<//Review>

I had a good experience today when renting a storage room from property manager Ashley. She was extremely helpful and informative which made things a breeze. She got us in and out in no time at all. Also property was very clean and well maintained.</Review>

I've been a long time renter from Public Storage and there has been several Managers throughout the years and I just met Linda who is so KIND, PLEASANT, and CARING. She will be a Great Manager for the E. March Lane location  in Stockton. Pubic Storage Management take the time to acknowledge her greatness. Welcome aboard Linda..!!<//Text>

my wife and I just moved to nor cal from so cal. We needed a unit to rent we were tired and frustrated after a long drive. When we got here Dee was very helpful and nice. she made our move in easy and stress free. The property was very clean. The staff is friendly and always willing to help us. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a storage place that is clean with a great staff.<//review>

i come every month to this property and have yet to see it dirty. The girls here take very good care of the property and their customers. i have  2 spaces here(really need to get down to 1) but the price is fair. i always rely on the girls there to remind me when the bill is due and they always call me so i'm not late. They do a very good job here!! i would definitely come back when i need them again. Thanks!!< /Review>

At this public storage from Mary was such a release from the pressure that I'm going through because of my circumstances it was good to be able to have someone that treated me with respect and honor and not look at my situation and say anything other than good things she was encouraging in fact I'm left feeling good about myself and tomorrow's going to be better and I thank you very much< /Text>

She helped me with finding the right size unit, and security of the place. She made it really easy to get things set up.< /Review>< pics>

Just got done with Mary at public storage. Such a quick and easy process. Nice clean unit and way cheaper then every other place i checked. However, they change managers frequently and the units are always getting broken into. They raise their storage rent without notice and if the employees forget to tell you something  its somehow everyone else's fault not public storage's fault. Smh. Woll never store here again and I will tell people I know not to either.</review>

I recently rented a unit and was attended to by Araina. Although she was assisting someone else at the time she was courteous enough to acknowledge me by say "I'll be with you in a moment". she was very efficient at processing the necessary paperwork,  and always smiled. Now that is customer service. Thank you!<//Review>

Ashley went above and beyond...I needed the storage because of a
contentious eviction and I was very stressed out. She clearly sensed my distress and was very pleasant as well as accommodating.</Text>

<Text>This is my first experience with renting a storage space with Public Storage. Araina immediately greeted my daughter and I with a friendly and professional welcome. She was thorough with explaining the process, and offered boxes, tape & all other products available that might assist me with my move. I appreciate her answering my questions and making the overall experience very pleasant. Thank you Araina and your customer service is super! :-)</Text>< Pics>

<Review>The manager Araina was very knowledgeable about the services needed.  She showed us all of the facilities and explained about all of the codes, the importance of each individual putting their own code in so as to keep a record of who was at the facility.  She showed us the unit that we had reserved and explained the best way to fit what we were putting into the unit to maximize the space.  Araina was quick and exuded confidence in her knowledge.  It made the entire process quick and painless.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>Great Staff. Katrina and Dee are such a nice couple of ladies. They go above and beyond the call of duty.

I recommend this facility to everyone. My storage needs were met, I got a small unit for almost 3 weeks.

Easy access to the unit and very secure location.

Don't forget to check out my music in iTunes, amazon, Google Play,

I am Carl Kuhl the greatest classical music composer that ever lived, lol.

Just a plain composer.

Thank you Katrina and Dee for being so nice to a crippled up truck driver.</Review>< Pics>

Since my last complaint about my damaged storage unit, I was contacted by the district assistant manager in 24 hours. That was satisfactory, also my concern has been met with professional conduct as well.</Review>

This PUBLIC STORAGE IS HORRIBLE , do not waste your time here , the young lady that work here is very disrespectful she had her family staying in the back I am pregnant & standing outside in the hot heat waiting for her to come to the door , then when I asked her you seen us standing out side you could’ve just told us something , she said I don’t have to tell you guys anything I’m on my break even before the security officer came and told
us she was made a run to the bank , but she comes with her friends . Just unprofessional and do not waste your time here , very rude and unprofessional!</text>

<review>ours small and intimate! I love the quality over quantity idea. Excellent coffee! The manager suggested the Signature latte, which is lavender and vanilla.  Their syrups are all organic and homemade!  They have a guy whose only job, is to make their syrup, and his only restriction is, that he is not allowed to use high fructose corn syrup! (Which i love) The bagels are homemade too, the croissants are baked fresh everyday!  The sandwiches are hand crafted for quality!  Just great food all around! I had the acai bowl,  my friends had the egg and smoked salmon, and an off menu item (Which she loved) called the Spicy J! Soo good, the food is TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT!  Just realize that there is one person working at all times, and food this good, should never be rushed!< /review>< Pics>

<Text>I'm absolutely impressed with the place!! How come I didn't know about them before?
I was in the area and decided to stop by for lunch. They were amazing from start to finish. Not only the food was delicious, but also the service was great!
They have varieties of everything: coffee, tea, cookies, sandwiches, macaroons, vegan, etc. The most important part is - it's organic! I got avocado toast and it was absolutely delightful. If you're looking for a cozy, affordable place to eat with great service and amazing food, I highly recommend to try them out! You won't regret!

BALÍ coffee+ is even better than Starbucks!
They have great coffee and amazing food at affordable prices and the staff is super friendly.
The atmosphere is great like at home. Love this place. A new spin on relaxing and grabbing a bite to eat and, of course, a cup of coffee!!< /text>

Love this place!
Just the best coffee latte, I like with vanilla (they make their own abdolutely natural syrup)! All the macaroon I tried for now are awesome and the best I ever tried!
What I really like - all the menu options are unique and special. Service is very friendly. Thank you guys!  I will definitely be back!<//Review>

The coffee is really good here. As soon as you walk in you get such a lovely coffee aroma. I prefer this over Starbucks. I like that they have a pretty decent breakfast menu as well as a lot of pastries.
The workers here are really kind, they always make my food and my drink well, never had an issue with it. It Can get busy at times in the morning so make sure you get here early.< /review>

The atmosphere and good quality of coffee are important for me. I better skip a cup of coffee than will have it in Starbucks, sorry for those who prefer that place, nothing personal))
Being nearby and relying on the good reviews I stopped by this Coffeeshop. The place is not big, but so cozy and welcoming. The coffee (I took the oat latte) was just delicious! Also, they have such a cool thing as printing pictures or phrases on the foam! 🤩 The charming cherries on my latte were so cute. And I bet you won’t resist their desserts and macaroons (as I couldn’t...).
Definitely coming back if I am in this area!</Text>< pictures>

Super quaint lil coffee spot with great food, desserts, smoothies, & coffee!
Tables inside & outside & great comfort even though it’s a lil coffee shop. Way better atmosphere than Sbux.
Service is awesome here-you can tell he loves his job there. And, he remembers your name-that is great service!!
The neighbors say the desserts are sooo good-the acai & yogurt & smoothies are great!< /review>

<review>If you love coffee like I love coffee then this place is worth the trip. Great atmosphere and staff was friendly. It’s refreshing to get a nice, quality cup of joe and enjoy it in a comfortable environment. They roast beans every week, so you can take one bag to go and enjoy at home as well:)<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

BALÍ coffee+ was a great experience! I found my new favorite energy drink there! It has less sugar and calories than other energy drinks like Red Bull. It is also made of all natural ingredients! I definitely recommend to try it out!</Review>

Does it seem suspicious to you that every single review is from a Russian speaking person and from accounts that only have 1 review? Dishonest practices. Don’t appreciate this. Google reviews is a safe space for people to share their honest opinions about the places so they can implement feedback and the best deserving places get more customers. Please keep it that way.</Text>

You’re right, for the last couple of weeks we got a lot of reviews from Russian speaking community in San Diego, which we don’t consider a problem. The reason is five events that we recently had, like baby showers and birthday parties.. But overall most of our reviews are from tourists and residents of San Diego:) which we are very grateful for! If you have a chance, you can come by to give  your opinion about the service and food! Thank you for your time!'}</response><Gmap_id>0x80d95307438f18a7:0xafd7aabd455c2d5d</Gmap_id></record>

This coffee shop is my new go to spot for sandwiches. You can choose your bread for the sandwich: croissants or bagel. They grill all their sandwiches! Egg and bacon is my favorite! You should definitely give it a try!<//Review>

<Text>Bali is a very cozy, warm Cafe with not only great coffee, also delicious, healthy smoothies, sandwiches and desserts.

My mixed berry smoothie was phenomenal. For breakfast, I had a salmon egg croissant & salami cheese which were both extremely delicious and filling.

The fresh orange juice, Martinelli apple juice are also two of my favorites.

My Latte was superb with cute art in the foam. My first at Bali, I even got my picture done on the coffee foam! This is a unique machine only at Bali in southern california.

For dessert, I had a scrumptious chocolate, walnut brownie and blueberry muffin.

Their hours are great 7a-7p everyday and they even do a happy hour deal on a sandwich, coffee plus dessert for only $10.

I rank Bali best coffee/sandwich cafe in East Village and top ten San Diego.< /Text><Rating>5<//Rating><pictures>None<//pictures>< Gmap_id>

Wow what a great place! Stop by this darling coffee shop on 11th and had a cup of coffee. But not just any cup of coffee! They wrote on top of my coffee my company's name! Almost didn't want to drink it but it was too good pass up. The coffee, sandwiches, and desserts are super plus they have other specialty drinks as well. Check it out oh, you'll love it!< /text>

<Review>I was visiting San Diego for the weekend and decided to grab some breakfast in downtown. This is a very cute coffee shop with a welcoming and lovely barista! She made me a fresh vanilla wellness latte with their homemade syrup!!! I got a Nutella muffin with it as well! The muffin was the best one I tried ever!!! It’s so rich and filling! The owner also bakes banana bread which is also delicious!

<username>Madison Nocon<//username><review>This place is AMAZING! The macaroons are perfection and their assortment of drinks and flavors is a dream!
I don’t typically drink coffee, so the barista made me a coconut milk lavender steamer. It was the best one I’ve ever had. Also; They make all their syrups in house, so you know that the ingredients are fresh. J reez (their barista) gave 11/10 service.
If you get a hot drink, they also offer custom latte art on all drinks! So cool! Definitely check them out if you haven’t already.<//review><resp>None<//resp>< Date>

After perusing the menu, I went with the salmon pesto sandwich on ciabatta and I was not disappointed. The homemade pesto is absolutely delicious! For dessert, I had a latte and hung out for a while to get some knitting done. It's a cute, quiet little cafe that's conducive to working on a laptop or reading, and there's seating available indoors and out. Be sure to ask for J! He is currently working on the menu, creating vegetarian sandwiches, and new signature drinks!< /text>< Pics>

<Review>I’ve ordered Macarons from here on Valentine’s day and was absolutely disappointed. Flavors were far different from what I had ordered, came in 2 different boxes instead of one presentable gift box of 24, as if it was leftovers thrown together at the last minute and not one week pre-order. I also was promised to have free delivery, they failed on that one too. Owner promised to make up with bonus macaroons and I’ve received  nothing since even after making two followups. I am not recommending this place.< /Review>< Pics>

Me and my family came to San Diego from Pittsburgh and stopped by at this amazing place! Coffee is soo good and very well prepared!! Sandwiches were fresh and very delicious. Their cookies are the best ones I’ve had!! Barista is very nice, helpful and talkative! Very pleasant atmosphere and brilliant service!! Next time I visit San Diego, I’m definitely coming back! Thank you for making my vacation so great 😃<//review>

I'm not keen on this place.
The espresso is weak and flavorless.
Be mindful of the upcharges especially on the sandwiches. The cashier will ask if you wish for your sandwich to come on a croissant or ciabatta not communicate to you there is an additional charge and there's no information on the menu about additional cost for either.

This feels dishonest - and it's certainly not worth the extra $$.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) It so happened that she decided to take a walk in the center of Downtown and purely by chance went for a cup of coffee in an amazing cafe. You know, in San Diego there are a lot of different cafes with different tastes of coffee, but for some reason the most delicious coffee in Bali Coffee, well, really, it feels like coffee with Love. I felt the difference! And also, there is a very cozy atmosphere, friendly service and the main hobby of a coffee shop, a portrait on a glass is so unusual and cute) thanks guys, for the good emotions and warm welcome, and most importantly delicious coffee). I will be happy to return to this cozy cafe Bali coffee!

Так получилось, что решила погулять в центре Даунтауна и чисто случайно зашла на чашечку кофе в удивительное кафе . Знаете, в Сан Диего много разных кафе, с разными вкусами кофе, но почему-то самый вкусный кофе в Bali Coffee , ну правда, чувствуется, что кофе с Любовью. Разницу я почувствовала! А ещё, там очень уютная атмосфера, дружелюбное обслуживание и главный конёк кофейни, портрет на стаканчике - это так необычно и мило) спасибо ребята, за хорошие эмоции и тёплый приём, а главное вкусный кофе). С удовольствием буду возвращаться в это уютное кафе Bali coffee !< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The best cafe! Great cafe, and what incredible desserts. So, as many are on good nutrition, here you can find delicious treats that are perfect for proper nutrition.
For me, the atmosphere and service are important, the Bali cafe is the institution where you are completely immersed in the atmosphere and recharged with energy.
Thanks a lot !!!

Лучшее кафе! Прекрасный кафе, а какие невероятные десерты. Так, как многие находятся на правильном питании, здесь можно найти вкуснейшие лакомства, которые прекрасно подходят правильному питанию.
Для меня важна обстановка и обслуживание,  кафе Bali -  это то заведение в котором полностью погружаешься в атмосферу и заряжаешься энергией.
Спасибо большое !!!</Review>< pictures>

< review>
First time trying this restaurant. And now that I read other reviews I understand I was a victim to  of overcharged bill. be careful
To begin with Bad service
We ordered a aguachile 3/5
La casuela “parrillada” da de mariscos for 3 ppl the sauce wasn’t good  2/5 $50
Dozen of oysters they hardly had meat in them 1/5. $17
And a cooked shrimp ceviche plate 2 ppl $30

Everything was a little over priced except for the oysters which I thought was $17
But when I saw the bill I got overcharged and paid $40 instead and extra beer. 3 buckets $120

Shady nothing makes sense but for sure not coming back.

Just pay attention at your bill. Especially if they think you had a lot to drink. My bill came out $300+ the audacity to rob you right in your face.<//review>

Chips are store bought, the meat in the burrito was sour (it gave my sister food poisoning), and everything else was bland and needed to be drowned in salsa.

The food is delicious. The staff is very nice and outgoing but the music is way too loud. Could not hold a conversation with the people at our table and we had to yell to order our food. Good for drinking and partying. Not so good for going out with the family.< /review>

<text>Awesome little brewery in a cornete opposite of the U-Haul. Never knew they were here! Absolutely delicious beers, and great cream/dark beer selection. It’s all a bit on the sweeter side. But hey, it’s 2 kids. Absolutely friendly staff, small little area but family friendly and great place for a tasting<//text>< username>

The green haired lady is the most delightful person to chat with.  She loves anything Star Wars and will smile as you ramble on sipping fine beer.  The bearded man knows ALL things beer.  Ask him about, ohhhh...the pitch use in the casks from the 1850...
These two kids brew some of the finest awarded winning beers in San Diego.  Not huge in size...epic in taste.  A must visit on your beer tour.< /review>

Very fun and energetic brewery. Good beer and you can have a nice little taste before diving right in on a pint or a growler. Plenty of options right next door if you want to grub out too. Got my beer home and poured it into a 2 Kids glass and it was delicious. Will be back soon. Thanks<//Text>

Awful beer. Asked for the 5x$10 sampler and tried one after another trying to find a decent beer but each and every one tasted disgustingly. One was too water down to the point I was hilariously grossed out. Temperature on beers were too hot, even in the winter afternoon. Next one tasted rancid and the other once had a banana aftertaste and the bad experience continued on and on. A friend of a friend suggested the place so at one point I started to suspect I was in a hidden camera or that they were playing a prank on me but it turned out it was all real. Too bad because it is a very cozy place and the guy at the bar is a nice fella. I hate to give this place a bad review, but they really need to figure out their recipes and get some help with the storage and tapping system if they wish to stay in business. I brew my own beer, so hopefully they will give some credit to this feedback.<//text>

They are a very, small microbrewery located in the heart of Miramar, AKA Beeramar, which is very convenient around the area, esp. during traffic time. They have a unique craft beer selection, and are a Star Wars themed brewery. Good place to stop by if you happen to be around the area!</Text>

<Review>Great new brewery!  We got to meet one of the "2 kids" and she made the experience even better!

Great "drinkable" beers - without a bunch of distractions in them (cranberries, walnuts, etc...).

Well worth the stop!  :)< /Review>< GmapID>

Tasty. Busy both times I went, which I was happy to see. Once you've tried them all, head to Pacific right next door.

Second time I went the entire menu was IPAs, I was a little bummed about that, but I'm assuming the menu changes all the time!< /Text>

Michael Blunt and his staff are the best in town. Not to mention the salon, bistro and blow out bar are top notch. Don't waste your time going anywhere else. This is Hollywood style in Fresno.< /text>

<text>Very fancy on the inside with a bistro/bar. Plenty of seating, friendly and helpful stylists. I was helped immediately for two kids haircuts on a walk in. I was seated right by my kids and brought water promptly by the bistro attendant who also offered me many other delightful drinks.

Best part is that my kids were grumpy and tired from a long flight but left happy and excited for the new cuts. But certainly not before they got to walk down the catwalk! Yes, that's right, there is a catwalk!<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNf-YpTJUJsjMcJRf42_UgQLfv8hcFsnXpjnQVt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEesO2scMj9f_t7uRSMTrG-R5Hxgl7ZdtzDBWR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVqtwdl4mHztfJn-97nPgsGK3eDE4Va6ZlROxF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipML8eAuzmj-iuoXdZCFttQpBGMRBNWmF0jtdyJK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOw_BjESdCpnX6vM-J6Rl-3uKup-3eoxZpvpxTU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGPiEnZnzx929UlzYc1_Gd5hlQqMSt-6VUsJEJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Rating>

Many thanks to Michael L. for razor cutting my hair into a lovely asymmetrical pixie.  Oh, and BTW, he was fixing a $120 hair cut from   another salon that left me with a freakin' mullet.  I feel like a woman again!</review>

this salon looks like a hotel. it is made very well. the bistro sells amazing grilled cheese. the coffee is good. the service is great. it is a little expensive but you won't regret it. Hanna was my colorist and she is very talented. I loved her work. she created magic in my hair.< /text>

I made an appt online got 2 confirmation emails including the day before, I show for my appt and apparently it showed I made an but it wasn’t saved they tried to fit me in and give me half the service that I wanted. Not my fault that someone didn’t save my appt correctly and then try to fit me in for half a service. I’m not paying hundreds of dollars for mediocre service. Your loss, I had money to spend< /Review>

<Review>I'm new to Fresno and hadn't had my hair done since March 2020 - thanks to Covid.  Found this salon on Google Maps. So happy I did. Krisha gave my super curly hair a Brazilian Blowout. Looks fantastic.  She's warm, personable and professional - not pushy.  I'll be back. For sure.

The salon is beautiful.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>I had Shelby for my colourist. She was wonderful. She nailed it for the desired color I was trying to achieve. One more visit and it will be 100%. It took a lot longer than expected. She did not put much effort into styling my hair after coloring it. Very disappointed</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Rate>4</Rate>< user>

Pedro is an amazing hairdresser! But all the stylists are very friendly and knowledgeable. Looking forward to the permanent location across the parking lot!< /Review><UserId.>111769316950612800463</UserId.>< Date>

I called for a appointment, and the woman who answered gave me the worst attitude, I was asking for days that  they were available, and “she said what are we doing” and she kept on giving me the worst attitude, when I was doing nothing. BAD COSTUMER SERVICE AND THAT WAS THE WORST EMPLOYEE.< /Text>

Michael is a true artist!
I'd had a bad haircut a while ago and was expecting that Michael could fix it. He completely understood my frustration with how my hair was looking and captured exactly what I wanted.
When I looked at myself in the mirror after he was done, I was shocked! I had the most perfect haircut I could have asked for.</text>

Salon itself was good but the hair stylist, Lauren, was awful. She scheduled someone else between my time and she basically destroyed my hair. I asked for Burgundian hair color and after three and half hours she end up with dark brown. I absolutely hate this color. Also since that day I have itchy head. don`t go to her if you like you time, money and hair!<//Review>

This place is terrible. The first time I went the stylist completely screwed up my hair. I made an appointment 2 months later with a different stylist. I show up on time and wait about 15 minutes then get approached and told they won't be able to get me in today. Dont make appointments you can't keep and dont let the person sit there for 15 minutes before telling them. I would give them a 0/5 if I could.<//Text>

First of all I am one of those type of girls that are very sensitive about their hair. I came to this place after a devestating Groupon experience at Tre'sorle Salon & Spa that left me in tears (the hair stylist said she had 40 years experience, and gave me high lights but looked like freaking reces pieces-> orange, yellow, black) anyways I was seen by Lindsey Case Manos, told her about my ordeal and showed her the same pictures I showed the previous hair stylist. Lindsey gave me an honest answer "that's not a one time appointment, you have to do several to get to the foundation down first, if you want hair to look like that" the other hair stylist was "sure we can do it!" I had my Sisters Wedding where I was the Maid of honor (mind you its my only sister and first one to marry) Lindsey was my only hope to undo the mess the 40 year experience hair stylist did. I have now seen Lindsey a total of 3 times now, the other day I looked in the mirror and looked at my hair and teared up because I felt beautiful. She gave me that moment where you finally get what you ask for and it's more than you expected. I loved my experience at Micheal Blunt Salon very professional. If you go there drop my name (Ellie), ask for Lindsey and say you read my story. I'm posting my after picture, my before picture is at Tre'sorle Salon & Spa<//Text>

Awful cat piss smell all over the place gave me a headache after 10 seconds I came inside. The lady at the counter charged me $2.65 for a bottle of water (that cost $0.75 anywhere in Downtown LA).  Do not recommend this “store”.< /Text>

I live little supermarkets because of the specialty items. I don't like that they usually overcharge by a few bucks. Best pay attention at the register. They always apologize once I ask for explanation, but it's not cool for them to do this.< /Text>

I love this little mom and pop market, but I hate that they usually over charge. Not a cool business practice. They are the only ones in the area I have found to carry green bananas {guineos verdes ;)} and Honduran snacks, so I will always shop here, but they really need to clean up the register act.</review>

I got a combo plate. The taco was good but definitely not an enchilada. It was a taco rolled up with sauce on it. The cheese inside was not melted or even warm in temperature. Disappointed.<//review>

<review>I ordered my regular California burrito through Uber eats, I was delivered a shrimp burrito instead. I called the restaurant They told me they had made a mistake so I had to drive to the restaurant to pick up my California burrito that I ordered without cheese or guacamole. The woman at the cash register refused to remake my burrito after that the restaurant messed up my order twice. I even called down ahead of time to make sure they got the order details correct. I normally get good service at this establishment but the woman working the cash register on the afternoon shift was very rude and non-accommodating when the restaurant was clearly in the wrong</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc01b551d47ce1:0xc1df08c1ad0f8477<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Nice friendly staff with an amazing cook who knows how to make a delicious veggie burrito and from what I hear an amazing Cali burrito as well. Highly recommend coming here if you're in the area. Won't regret the service or the memorable quality.</Review>

Very good tacos. Appropriately sized for the price. Chef was funny and checked in on our table to make sure all was good and to make some conversation. Interesting historical photos hanging on the walls. Will go back if I'm nearby.<//review>

Wrong tortillas, asked for flour, everyone got corn..... 4 bowls they messed up, dont know how..... at almost 10 bucks a bowl, there has to be some proper pred and due diligence.

I thoroughly appreciated my time here with Dr. Frank and his team. I had gone almost weekly from the end of July to my last appointment earlier this week since I had to fix lots of things. I had a huge fear and never was comfortable with any dentist until I met Dr. Frank and his team. I felt more and more comfortable coming in, and most often, I was excited to swing by and continue to get the help I needed! They make sure you're doing okay during your appointment and tend to whatever it is you need help with. I feel much more comfortable with my smile, and no longer am I having pain. He and his team were quick and handled things with grace. I honestly will miss them seeing them regularly, but overall I'm glad that we took care of everything :) Thank you so much! I look forward to seeing them all next time</review>

I am so happy to have Dr. Esfandiari take care of my dental needs. He is the most fair and honest dentist that I have ever met in my life. I had bad experiences in the valley with other doctors who diagnosed treatments that I needed and one time I ended up with a bad infection. I can't talk enough about the quality of work that Dr. Frank does and his humility. He is truly a great dentist and me and my family are grateful to have a quality dentist like him that we can go to anytime. Thank you Doctor.< /Review>

A pleasant experience from beginning to end. From the moment you walk in to Dr. Frank’s waiting room, you know you are in good hands. The staff at Dr. Frank’s office made me feel super relaxed. They are extremely courteous, kind and helpful in getting me checked in and processed.
Dr. Frank has a good steady pair of hands and explains every procedures he’s conducting. I had several procedures completed that morning (X-rays, consulting, cleaning, filling repair) and I felt like I was in and out in no time. He is so professional and extremely diligent.
I definitely enjoyed my visit to Dr. Franks and I’m looking forward to continue seeing him and his staff for all my dental needs in future.< /Text>

<Review>I have been seeing Dr. Frank for 6 years now. Him and the staff are kind, curtious, and respectful. I never have to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated, and once I’m seated I’m taken care of right away.

Growing up I have had a fear of the dentist, but I’m excited to come see Dr. frank and the staff here at Family Village Dentistry. They truly are professionals and have 10/10 quality service.

I will be continuing to come here for ALL my dental needs.

Thank you for your help and care of my teeth.</Review>< pics>

<text>Dr Frank is by far the best dentist around. He and his staff are so friendly and always greet you with a smile. Dr Frank goes out of his way to make you feel comfortable and treat you with respect and like family. He is very knowledgeable and experienced in his field and provides comprehensive dentistry without ever trying to "oversell" unnecessary treatment. He is probably the most honest and caring dentist I have ever gone to and I am very grateful to have him as my dentist!<//text></record>

THE BEST DENTIST IN THE WORLD
The title is no lie, this man is amazing. My work recently switched dental insurance providers, which left me looking for a new dentist. I luckily stumbled across Dr. Frank. I have since told everyone I know that I have the best dentist in the world, and am pleased to share that with you as well. As a single mother of three, dental care and expense is usually the last thing on my to do list. This man had me in tears at my first visit- tears of joy, because he was so understanding to my situation financially and put my health and safety first. Understand, he saved me a lot of pain and money. He is a good hearted man- something you do not find often in healthcare and should be recognized. His work is flawless, in comparison to an extraction I had done a year ago with a different dentist, the other dentists work left me in extreme pain for over a week, Dr. Frank did the same procedure in which I noticed he took his time and it reflected in my recovery. With Dr. Frank I had no pain after my  extraction. His work ethic, results, office staff, mannerism are all beyond any service I have ever had. Please if you need a good dentist- go here.
Sincerely happy with the best dentist in the world,
Gabby V</review>

<resp>None<//resp><review>Dr. Frank Esfandiari is amazing and a master at his profession.  His technique with the Novocaine needle was painless, and he was very communicative throughout the whole process.  The filling he did in my back molar came out perfect, if I could give him more than 5 stars I would. Additionally, the cleanings he provides are very thorough and done by him, not by an assistant.  He really cares about his patients and does excellent work.  My 10 year old son is also a patient and very pleased with him, too.< /review>< Name>

The office is cozy and professional. My family and I were well taken care of there! My step daughter has special needs and Dr. Frank and his staff went out of their way to make her feel comfortable and safe. His assistant did a better job cleaning my teeth than anyone EVER has! Top notch!< /review>

Worst dentist experience in my entire life. I waited half an hour behind my appointment time that I showed up early for, and when I finally sat in the chair for my first interaction with Dr Frank, he didn’t even introduce himself before he started poking around my mouth. He spent all of twenty seconds before making a decision on my care, and then spent maybe five minutes doing my cleaning. I’ve never had a dentist make me cry in the chair but when I audibly groaned and tried to move my head he just kept on going and told me I had to deal with it, instead of caring about my pain level. He showed an intense lack of interest in me as a patient and instead reviewed another patient’s x-rays while he was cleaning my mouth. I’ve never seen such lack of professionalism from a doctor and I will certainly never return.< /Text>

Saw me on short notice as a new patient for a chipped tooth and then when i came back set me up by fixing two of my old fillings.
The office isn't the nicest but they don't make you wait too long.  The whole staff seems competent and efficient and friendly.
More importantly Dr. Frank is the only dentist I've ever had that didn't make me feel like he was trying to wring every cent out of me.  He was candid about my situation and my options and costs and his recommendation was in my best interest rather than his wallets.< /review>

Dr. Frank is an NYU graduate, and does the best, most updated dentistry in Ventura County.  He is so professional, his staff is well paid and happy.  He is always in a good mood.  He is one of the last true public servants in medicine.  Don't be intimidated by his last name, Dr. Frank is 100% born and bred Southern Californian.  He has a great bedside manner, for a dentist.  He has two offices. One in TO and one in Ventura,  and alternates thru the week.  I am so lucky to have found him. He has saved me several times.  He takes cash, credit card, and his staff will work with you to figure out payment.  Yes, he takes Gold Coast.  Call to get a question answered first if you don't want to drive to see him and he sometimes will even speak to you himself to clarify, or explain.  His staff speaks spanish.

I have struggled my whole life to find good dentistry. I have had pain, and years of agony not going to the right person. Dr. Frank Esfandiari is the only dentist you should visit.  So, sharing this info is the least I can do.

i was born and raised in Ventura, and have gone to more than a handful of dentists.  HE IS THE BEST.  He is a dedicated doctor, lives in the county, and a family man.<//Text>

<Text>I know Frank since High School. I could never imagine that once I will be his patient and more over, I could never imagine that he will become such an excellent Dentist. He is the best Dentist, I have ever had. In spite of the fact that his prices were so reasonable but still he gave me a BIG DISCOUNT. THANKS TO HIM.</Text>< pictures>

<Name>John Tavolieri</Name><Review>My wife has had some severe dental problems in the last couple of years but has been afraid to go to the dentist to get them corrected. She has that a fear of a previous dentist and I've understood that because there are some people in the profession who are just not overall good at performing Dentistry or good with the public. The dentist there took their time with my wife so she felt comfortable and got most of the work done she needed to correct her problems. She will go back and get the rest of the work needed to correct the rest of the problem. My wife wholeheartedly recommends and will refer anybody who needs to get dental work done from Thousand Oaks Village Family Dentistry. Thank you Thousand Oaks Village Family Dentistry for taking care of my wife and bringing back her dental health.<//Review><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

I have been going to Dr. Frank for a while now and I am glad I found his dental office.  I don't like going to the dentist in general but Dr. Frank always makes me feel comfortable when I go to see him, no matter how nervous I am.  The girls that work in office with him are also amazing.  I have had to get a lot of work done over the last few months and he has done an exceptional job!  I would recommend Dr. Frank & Village Family Dentistry to everyone!<//Review>

Great Dentist.  I was very happy to find an honest and affordable dentist in town. After being on hold with western dental 3 times (2 of the times they hung up on me) I decided to google dentists in thousand oaks who take denti-cal.  Lucky for me, Dr. Frank answered the call and told me to come right in. I was on hold with western dental longer than it took for me to get my best friend to the village family dentistry and have his evaluation and tooth pulled all at no extra charge, for the emergency visit. Now that is service! Very friendly and excellent office.
Thanks! I will refer anybody who asks me if I know a good dentist.<//review>

As a person that unfortunately has major dental issues due to genetics, and therefore has been to more dental professionals than I can count, I personally can not say enough good things about Dr Frank and his staff ... then add the fact that he has also seen and treated all 3 of my children (14. 13 & 9) and not only do they like him but they have absolutely zero fear of the dentist now thanks to their visits to his office and that alone speaks more volumes of praise than I ever could  ... needless to say I and my family would definitely recommend Village Family Dentistry to anyone looking for a favorable dental experience finally!< /review><UserId.>113318589324516803745<//UserId.><Time>1473194848937<//Time><pics>None< /pics><gmap_id>0x80e83abb96f0dfc5:0x99c31366e3f8ddde<//gmap_id><username>The Kelly's<//username><response>None<//response><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

I have been going to Dr. Esfandiari for years. I have always had a big fear of dentists since I had bad experiences a number of years back. He puts my anxiety at ease and is incredibly gentle. He always does an excellent job and that is why I drive all the way from Downtown LA to see him. I would never go anywhere else. Highly recommend this practice to anyone that needs a good dentist.<//Text>

<review>I have been going to Dr. Frank for almost 7 years and all I have to say is how LUCKY I am to have him as my dentist.  I neglected to go to the dentist for many years because of a super bad experience when I was younger.  I knew I needed major work done and  I was referred to him by a friend for being not just a great dentist but a dentist that is caring and understanding to life's circumstances.  I drive 100 miles round trip just to see him and he is worth it.  I did not have insurance since the first appointment I had in 2008 and still don't to this day and he has always made payment arrangements for me and has never disappointed me.  He is not in for the money but he is in his profession to make people SMILE and that is what he has done for me for many years.  DR. FRANK YOU ARE AWESOME AND APPRECIATED!!<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<text>No Fear !! No pain !!  Best Dentist Ever!!!!!
I first saw Dr Frank in Dec of 2014 ... He was recommended to me by a friend , I was in agony ! Tooth was blowing up, pain like I have never had ... Understand this .. I was a dentist fearful patient for many years ( I had a lot of deep gum planing done several years back which was ..at best .. an experience in torture ..and the dentist I had at the time were of no comfort ..) I spent many , many years avoiding the dentist out of fear of judgement which was a very stupid thing to do ... From my fear I screwed myself badly ..... This amazing dentist is non judgmental - he doesn't shame u and just wants to fix your oral health !! Dr Frank has extracted 4 teeth ( it had to happen ) and done two root canals with so little pain !!!  He gives the best numbing shots ever !!! He is fast, exacting , kind , supportive and just an amazing dentist !!!</text>< pictures>

My experince at Thousand oaks villiage dentistry was exellent! Got x-rays and a very deep cleaning done that you would not get anywhere else from normal check up. In my opinion it is a very good thing to get done so your gums and teeth can stay healthy. What  great start for the new year! Thank you!</review>

Absolutely amazing and caring staff, they are very thorough in explaining procedures and answering any questions you may have. Dr. Esfandiari was awesome as well and got me through my root canal that I was very nervous about without pain and did a great job! I never wanted to go to the dentist but now when i feel like i have tooth ache or just going for a regular check up is like going to see my friends. Everyone at the office is so friendly and caring, not to mention  Dr. Esfandiar calmed my nervous from beginning to end, i always felt like i had a friend there with me during the whole root canal!! Recommended  Dr. Esfandiar to all my family and they all now take my nieces and nephews there as well!< /Review>

<Review>I usually do not feel very comfortable going to the dentist but Dr. Esfandiari has changed all that. His demeanor and knowledge set my mind at ease as he dicussed the fact that I needed a crown. He showed my digital x-rays and photographs to explain my case to me in layman's terms. The whole process was pain-free and I love the result. I should have done this years ago. I have told my whole family about Village Family Dentistryl!

PROS: Great Location, Caring Dentist, Affordable
CONS: None!< /Review>< date>

I needed a wisdom tooth pulled out and came into Dr. Frank's office. I am on Medi-Cal and was worried about the quality of the service I would be getting. He and his staff are friendly. He explained the procedure and the total time I was there was about thirty minutes. The office is a bit on the small side but clean.
I plan on future appointments with him and his staff.<//text>

<Review>UMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

"At Village Family Dentistry of Thousand Oaks, Dr. Frank Esfandiari cares about your comfort, safety and health. "

THE ABOVE IS NOT IN THE LEAST BIT TRUE!!!
All this office cares about is MONEY!!! They have no empathy for their patients and I plan to take legal action as well as reporting them to the State Board of Dentistry under section 8 for the extreme pain and suffering I have endured because there lack of care, disrespect and negligence!!!!!

As soon as Dr. Frank Esfandiari heard I had a not so good insurance and that he was not going to get any cash out of me he tried to send me to an oral surgeon (that my insurance didn't take and knowing I have no job or money right now) and this is when I'm in sever pain and crying with a possible bacteria infection!!! He was talking about MONEY the whole time and what percentage they where going to get to bill the guy they worked on before me...... 80%!!! And some one has a teenage daughter that comes with them to work everyday and eats stinky chili cheese Fritos, watches movies and sits so you can see her butt crack (so tacky) in the waiting room I'm pretty sure that is violating some section code!!!

I have work that I needs done and someone that will pay for yesterday was an emergency I ABSOULUTLY went to the WRONG PLACE!!!!<//Review><Rate>1< /Rate>< Pics>

Rude.  Also lied about credit card reader not working in order to collect cash.   This could have been communicated in advance.   Foot "massage" is not a massage, but more of a disinterested foot rub.<//Review>

< Review>
I found this salon on Yelp and it has great reviews and now I know why! It is clean! The technicians are professional and they do nail art! They have extensive nail art! That is a big thing for me because I have tried several salons and they can only do basic nails. I am really picky about my artist. I called about three hours to schedule a same day appointment and they told me to come in at 6. I didn't have to wait, they asked what I needed done and they even allowed me to change my color last minute. My artist was Ken(I think) he reshaped my nails perfectly and made them thicker, per my request. They have been open for three years and they didn't rush me or say anything about me being there past closing time. What a breathe of fresh air that they have a technician who can draw and create cute designs on your nails. This was my first time here so I didn't get any designs because I needed to see if they can handle the basics. They did! I will now come here and make it my regular shop. If you want to wow people with your nails, come to this shop!</Review>

My sister and I went on a Saturday morning and  got sat down right away and only spent an hour getting full sets and pedicures. Very clean and friendly staff. My only downfall with this place is the limited gel colors. I didn't find the exact color I was looking for but I was impressed that the woman working on my nails tried her best color match it. To me, that meant she cares about her customers. Major plus in my book. I will definitely make this place my new spot.</review>

This is a really nice place to go to get your nails or toenails done. The staff is super friendly and the place is always kept clean. This place is located at the San Dimas Station mall.< /Review>

<text>I went for my first time today and got a color change on my nails and toes I went in at 11am on a Friday and was immediately seated in a spa chair. I had Christmas nails done and the girls did such a phenomenal job I have never been happier with my nails in my life. They all came out straight and square just the way I like there wasn’t a mess all over my nails and toes. Definitely going back! Love this place and highly recommend it!< /text>< user_id>

Great place for a mani-pedi. Be prepared and get just what you sent in for. Extras are not worth it.🙄</Text>

< Review>
It was my first time coming here and i was not impressed. got my nails done yesterday11-8-16 by Holly and I needed a fill. Well after Holly was done I was very unhappy she didn't fill my nails completely. And it was expensive I paid $63 for a pedi and a fill and for gel color and I didn't even get a design or jewels. :/< /Review>

Had the steak and eggs. The steak was ok. I ordered it medium but it came well done. I don't think it was a quality cut, a little tough. Definitely not worth the $25. I also ordered an ice cappuccino but was told the cappuccino machine was broken. Kinda glad it was because on the way out I saw it and it was literally a machine that dispenses already prepackaged cappuccino. I would of thought they made the espresso fresh. Our server was good an attentive.</Text>

The food is overpriced, French toast are simple made with the cheapest bred and no flavor powder sugar was not even visible four small half slices with out a wow flavor. Also ask for eggs as simple as they can be with a cheap probably farmer johns bacon again not much flavor and nothing special for the price. Also ask for toast on the side which never received and was placed on the bill. Besides the fact that we had to ask for utensils three times before getting them. Coffee I think that am/pm has better coffee, Only reason why I gave two stars was place is clean and a very nice establishment the food really needs to be upgraded. Oh the muffin that my wife had was very good . I would not recommend this place to eat breakfast.</text>

I have been here twice since the pandemic and although it's a convenient place to have lunch both food quality and service has diminished. Both times food was salty and putting in our order has taken longer than it should have. Not sure why that is, maybe they are not fully staffed. I will continue coming here as it is convenient, however, I'm sure there are better options out there.<//Text>

<review>Mimi’s is the perfect place to relax and enjoy a meal. If nothing else is open. Ranks right up there with refrigerated sandwich’s from your local gas station. Good breakfast muffins and clean urinals. Waitresses are constantly above average surprisingly.</review>< pictures>

<Text>ZERO STARS!! Horrible service!! We've been wanting to come here for a while and when we finally did we were treated very poorly.  My family and I waited more than ten minutes for a menu. No one came back to ask if we wanted anything to drink or ask if we've been helped. We were completely ignored from the moment we walked in. The restaurant was not busy and when we walked in they were just looking at us, we were just standing  there waiting to be seated. This place made me feel extremely discriminated.  I don't know who runs or owns this place but they're doing a HORRIBLE JOB! After a few minutes of sitting there waiting I started a timer to see how long we were waiting and ten minutes had gone by. We walked out very unhappy and feeling discriminated.  These people are lazy or they only serve people who look pleasing to them.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! WORST RESTAURANT I'VE EVER BEEN 👎👎👎👎👎👎< /Text>< Pics>

<text>I want to thank Freddy Haro manager on shift today, for his kindness and free appetizer that he provided due to waiting longer then what was told to our party of 3. Nowadays it's hard on everyone and when someone corrects or makes wrongs right , it showed great customer service. Our waitress was extremely nice and attentive as well as all the  other waiters on shift this afternoon. Kindness , empathy is what the world truly lacks, so I want to say Thank you Freddy , food was very good and great customer service. I will definitely visit again!!!< /text><Name>Da ma< /Name>< Time>

Great atmosphere and food was great. French dips sandwich tasted a little strange but the French toast, scrambled eggs and bacon was great. Some of the best I’ve tasted anywhere. Staff was very nice and polite. Executed their duties as a server quickly and accurately.</Review>

They messed up my ice tea 2 times and once they finally gave me the right ice tea it tasted like African water!! The waiter looks brain dead and the food is straight boof!! Plus after I finished eating I was on the toilet for like 2 hours pooping my onion soup. Even in the onion soup they gave me a fat piece of onion.</text>

First timer.. I travel all over North America and I'll have to say the Eggs Benedict at Pat's Cafe are the best I've ever had. Home fries are perfect and what you expect! (Not frozen) with a nice watermelon slice on the side. Great coffee and friendly staff. I'll be back.< /text>

<Review>Not really impressed with this place. Server got one of our orders wrong, fixed but tried to charge us double. The menu said that toast or muffin comes with an omelette, but server insisted it qas extra. Ordered bacon on the side and one of the slices was barely a slice of bacon.

This place must train their people to be cheap and rip off the customer.

I do not recommend this place. Find some place else for breakfast. The service alone isn't worth it for mediocre food at best.</Review>< Rating>

I do understand were not in normal times, but getting poached eggs Benedict hard and not runny. Second, hard muffins. They were days old. Went back to exchange them for fresh ones. They were the same. Sorry, but I will never eat there again.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>I really enjoyed this spot. Nice people and good food. We didn't wait at all since we got there before it got busy. Very tight so expect to be a bit uncomfortable. Didn't like the sausage but that's just me. I would definitely come back and explore the menu.< /Review><time>1599816049445< /time>< Gmap_id>

Can’t believe this place is Still open.  Against my better judgment or just  there being a lack of options open at 9 am we came to mimis it took 27 minutes to take our drink order. Asked for fresh squeezed she said they  definitely had it , she ended up giving me a warm  cup of oj i saw her pour from a bottle< /text>

New favorite restaurant in town. Everything in the menu were PERFECT. genuine french baguette and butter itself was enough to impress me, but this place takes you straight to France, in some ways feels more France than France. what an amazing gastronomic experience for such virtuous price. we need sixth star for this one.<//Text>

What to know before you go:  down the street from MaMa's, delicious food, and no wait.
Why to eat:  Omelettes are fluffy, breads are so fresh and potatoes are great.

What to drink:  Coffee or mimosas<//review>

< Review>
During Covid-19 this business did the best possible in order to make everyone comfortable with seating outside. The tables were space properly and all rules were followed to the letter. I must congratulate Mimi's chef for the best prepared eggs benedict and corned beef hash that I've ever had anywhere. Eggs benedict brilliantly done. Impeccably prepared with no detail left out. I challenge any chef to come close. As I feel I've eaten my share of eggs benedict every weekend for the last 30 years. I would say I've had my share these are by far the best.. the muffin was crispy at the bottom outer layer, yet very tender and soft center. The egg is perfectly done, the yolk center flowed slightly not hard. The corned beef was served hot with a light crispy layer. The Hollandaise was very light but the flavor was defined as decadent. A small sprinkle of green flavored spice. The meal however slightly suffered because the coffee was lukewarm. However they decided to make a fresh pot which gives them high praise. Please try this dish hopefully something this good, and well prepared cannot be an accident. bon appetit!<//Review>

<Review>Very large portions of well prepared southern dishes. I ordered the Chicken fried steak and there were enough food for two. The catfish was also delicious, as were the fried chicken. Service was super friendly and place quite roomy with charming decor. Solid place to come visit when you are feeling extra ravenous.<//Review></record>

<review>I just liked their food. I always get excellent customer service here. The place is well organised and the staff members are always very nice. Keep up the good work.< /review></record></dataset><record>
<Review>First of all I want to say our waitress Keana was great absolutely no problem with her she's a sweetheart and provided great service in spite of the problem with the kitchen.  just a heads up this is probably on par with Denny's except they know what they are and won't serve food that is too complicated for them. expect half the menu to be frozen including the calamari, chicken, fish n chips, and fries.  so the food took forever the fries were cold when they got there. calamari was frozen and Soggy,  the kids chicken tenders were dry, presentation of the plates were subpar, fish and chips was way below average all in all a bad experience definitely not coming back. There's really no reason to the food isn't good, just straight up... the food also took a while saw other customers also asking where their food was.<//Review><userid>117938877178585158636< /userid>< rate>

The service is good have the staff tries, but the corporate parent seems to have cut back on little things that have unfortunately made a big difference. There once great Bread Basket which was a variety of carrot bread and baguettes have now just become a simple sliced baguette with some butter. The little extra things that made it special are gone. It is still worth of visit but the enthusiasm of that the place once had seems to have been tamped down considerably.<//Review>< Name>

Service was excellent and the food was good.  However, the place was almost empty at 8 PM on a Wednesday, and looked pretty run down, like they're just not making enough money to keep the place ship shape.  We remember going to Mimi's for family celebrations a while back, and it used to be nicer.  Soup/salad, two mains and a drink apiece came to $70 with tax and tip.  Parking was easy.<//Text>

We ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and the chicken was still pink in the inside. We also ordered a grilled chicken and mushroom pasta and the chicken was still not cooked right. The waitress took forever to bring us bread. We asked multiple times. She did bring us another sandwich but I gave up on my food. Was expecting better. We went on saturday night and it was pretty empty.< /review>

Went there for Thanksgiving, Waitress was rude. She couldn’t get the orders right, seem like she didn’t wanna be bothered. Will never go there again nor will I recommend it. The food was gross! The turkey Was like one of those TV dinners, salty and processed. The pie was over sweetened with sugar and frozen. Very boring, couldn’t choose anything else. Horrible!! Waste of money!<//review>

Good solid wine bar.

The cheese plate is delicious! One of the better ones I've had.

The music is a little too loud for my taste. It made it hard to talk to my boy friends and hear them.</review>

Much improved. The quality at this Mimis had fallen off lately, but our meals were fresh and  very delicious this trip. Customer service could still use some work.< /Review>

Food is great. So is the coffee. Alex our server was very nice and welcoming. Food took the appropriate time to come out. Some of the side dishes and items  had to be asked for, they were not brought out with the order. Overall another good experience.<//Review>

Can't describe just how good the food is. I've had their spinach and egg breakfast crepes, their omelets, the corned beef brisket hash, and muffins so far. My children have tried things across the menu. It's all been fabulous. Great staff, lovely atmosphere. And the mimosas are HEAVEN. Try them, u won't regret it.< /text>

Parking can be a problem, as there is only one entrance to the lot and it's in a shopping center that includes Best Buy and Costco.  Always busy.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

The Thanksgivings dinner was terrible. The portions was small. The Turkey was not fresh it was processed, salty, and cold. The pie was still frozen. I would not recommend Mimi"s for Thanksgivings ever.
I'm surprised because I've eaten there many times before and the food was fine.< /text>

On Thanksgiving day they only serve turkey, only one menu, nothing else, which we didn't know, and we were not told at all before waiting to be seated. The meal tasted like a school lunch cafeteria for the price of $19.99 a little pricey. The portions were really small.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7BilzsWj93mYu1hMfFhnAte1BWDyXTrj1mceb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

I know reviews can't do much when it comes to chains like Mimi's but I still wanted to say that I find it super weird that they don't have any alternative to regular milk for people that can't have it.  I went for a paint night event and that was a lot of fun but when I tried to order a latte or anything else without regular milk it seemed like I asked for the moon. Please start considering other options for people that can't have milk, we are so many and it's not our choice.</Review>

<review>Love Mimi’s. Just don’t get to eat there often. Recently, I had a birthday coupon for buy one, get one meal. I didn’t notice the coupon stated we needed to purchase two drinks as well. And the server didn’t bother to tell us that until we were ready to leave. 🤔 We didn’t really want to purchase drinks to go. Server needs better training.<//review><date>1537220102103</date><user_name>Laurel<//user_name><Rate>3<//Rate><UserId.>112729654990444931840<//UserId.>< pics>

<Review>Mimis Cafe, it is the place where I will keep going for ever, and have been a customer for years.  It doesnt matter what you are in the mood for, they have it.  Great place to hold office events, or just hanging out with friend to catch up.  They keep their season menu very active. I have done thanks giving dinners  with them for many years.  You will not be disapointed on any dish that you decide on,  Service is superb. Place is always clean and their bathrooms very upkeep. Tip for the weekend!  Since is a very good place , allow a  sufficient time for waiting, specially between 10 and 2pm</Review><user>101878854206224669728<//user>< pics>

Quiant homey old town feels here. Amazed at the decors and art curio scattered and hanged on its walls that had us busy while ordering our food. Satisfied with my order of grilled chicken which was tender as it was juicy. My companion had shrimps smothered in tomato sauce and it was good too. Lots of senior citizens here so be still.<//Review>

The Parking: Parking lot right around the restaurant. Since it is located at the end of the plaza so they kind of having their own parking lot. Easy to find parking spot.<//review><Rating>3</Rating><response>None<//response></record>

<review>“Cute, quaint, and quick service once seated.”
We've been dying to come here as a family. The decor is so cute--French cafe style. We did have to wait about 20 minutes to be seated because this place was packed!!! Thankfully there is lots of seating in the two waiting areas. When we were seated the waitress came quickly and from then on she worked her tail off...< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<text>Service was friendly and very attentive with the hostess setting the friendly mood while I waited about five minutes for seating.  This particular location is small with the capacity being 68 people.

I came in for breakfast and ordered the turkey, brie and mushroom crepes along with an almond croissant.

The crepes looked very somber hinting at a below average taste and after trying them I, unfortunately, cannot recommend them. But I would definitely try another breakfast entree coming back. The almond croissant was delicious (small with a very delectable and sweet nutty filling).</text>< pics>

<Text>What a pleasure. I stopped in the plaza to get  coffee... Ended up finding a spot to park close to Mimi's, and decided to go here instead of Starbucks. Everything was great.. service, food, speed, comfort. The soup and the desert blew me away. Creme brulee cheesecake slab pie! Amazing, will come again< /Text>< Pictures>

While visiting family in Los Angeles (Downey location) we dined at Milo's.
The muffins were Gorgeous, moist, and delicious. I ordered the Half Baked Chicken with spices. The chicken was very tender and delicious. If ever in L.A. I highly recommend dining here.< /text>

Horrible hostess, she ignored seating us preferring to work on to-go orders. My husband had to ask to be seated and when she did she had an awesome stank face. My food was obviously microwaved as my plate was hotter than my food. Our poor waitress was the only positive aspect of our night but you could tell she was overwhelmed.< /Review>

I loved this place. It was my first time here and what a difference. I usually go to IHOP or Denny's but let me tell you the difference in food is immediately noticeable. Mimi's food is fresh and hot compare to what you get lately at the other restaurants it seems like they are overwhelmed so you get your food warm or cold. The service at Mimi's is great and the atmosphere is awesome. I highly recommend this place.< /review>

<review>Our waitress Sandy ignored us and didn't even apologized for not bringing our drinks and complete order when we received our check she said it's ok we can remove that from there... the two stars is for the young man name Jonathan not our server that came to ask if we have been served got our order and was really friendly to us.. we tip him. We celebrate our last dinner to end the year at Mimi's as a tradition and this is the worst thanks to her service...<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Ambience was good. Nice and cozy.

Food was ok. The Calamari was nice and soft. But the BBQ Porkloin was a bit dry.

Service was too slow. But I commend the Manager for being hands-on and helping out with bringing in the food.

I'll still come back, if only for the Calamari.</Review>< Rating>

Usual mimis cafe. But food was salty. Too busy for individual attention. Although our waitress tried, I think, unable to pay close attention due to being busy serving other tables. Overall I think it was okay experience.  I am not sure about going back tho.< /text>

<text>Today's experience was unlike previous ones
First, my salad and meal arrived simultaneously, an arrival which was inconvenient  for me.  The mashed potatoes  were cold; the server, however, was accommodating, bringing me warmed potatoes  immediately.

I ordered meatloaf.  I just couldn't  determine its quality as I ultimately  decided to eat just half of the order.  For the first time--diuring an almost five-year patronage  of Mimis--I was disappointed with my experience.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

We attended Mimi's for an annual Thanksgiving meal. We had made a reservation the Monday before hand and had warned them of the size of our group. When we arrived they didn't have a table ready and said we needed to wait until a table ahead of us finished eating, though they were already running late.

Once we were seated the service was good; however, the food was extremely below standards. Everything was cold and the portions were incredibly small.< /Review>

I was not a fan of the food or the atmosphere here. It was bland and boring. The vibe was no good. The employees work kind and helpful however they just looked bored at work. I wish the employees were more engaged and more energetic at times. I tried a couple of the alcoholic beverages and they were okay.<//Text>

<Text>I love Mimi's, but I'm not impressed with this particular location. While I have enjoyed the food at other Mimi's, it seems like the cooks at this location don't know what they're doing. At my visit today, my husband's steak and eggs were not cooked to order (runny undercooked eggs when he asked for over-medium, and rare bloody steak when he asked for med-well). We even sent his dish back and it was still not correct 🙁 My Pork Chop was dry and bland and nothing like I've had at other locations. On the plus side, the waitress was cordial and attentive, and the manager was nice enough to adjust our bill for my husband's meal.< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I came in alone, but I didn't have to wait long even during the lunch rush.    Before I was seated the host asked if the seating was satisfactory, a nice change from showing someone to a table and walking away.  The server was prompt and courteous with just the right amount of friendliness.  (I find it disconcerting to be called "hon" or "mama" by a server.)  She checked back often and the service was the best I've received in a long time.
I came back today and the food and service were just as good.  I don't usually write reviews but this restaurant definitely exceeded expectations and deserves 5 stars.<//Review>

A rising star - finally seeing the menu getting a face-lift and much stronger recipes are in the house. The traditional spinach dip has given way to kale-based, the mussels are in what I'd consider almost a chowder base, and the chicken pot pie gained actual flavor.
What was always a challenge here was that the menu was adventurous, but the recipes never quite fit the bill. For example, during the last 10 years of supposed to be French Creole, the jambalaya had literally no heat or spices..  Blackened fish looked black, but had never touched cayenne in the pan.  Very strange menu engineering.
The menu is vastly simplified, keeping the perennial salad and sandwich favorites (almost...) and the bakery is still turning out muffin and bread varieties (but fewer than before, hopefully to lessen non-selling inventory.)
Service has been kicked up a notch, but is still sort of at an in-training level, really. You can tell there's some kind of re-organization going on, and it's probably a good thing if this particular chain will survive another 10 years. Things are changing daily, so sink-or-swim, I hope management stays the course, because there's a gold-mine if they can get the formula on-target here.
The on-table $20 french wines ($5/glass) are undersold, and under marketed (private label imported cellar.)  Probably happening because the staff isn't either comp'd on the sales, nor trained in what to describe about them.  This is a work-in-further-progress at the present.< /Text>

<Review>Very disappointing, poor customer service and poor quality food. Not one thing they served was what I ordered.
I wanted a spinach quiche and instead got one with soggy tomatoes that tasted like it had been defrosted in the microwave ! And the fruit side dish wasn’t that fresh either.
I then exchanged it for a veggie mushroom burger on sourdough - but I got regular bread instead, minus the fries illustrated in the menu.
And the tea I ordered was Earl Grey instead of English Breakfast and also tepid.
This Place has really gone downhill since I was here last month and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c2c0e8737155ab:0x91f27b85190bded3< /gmap_id>< user_name>

Food is surprisingly great, wasn't expecting it coming from a large family chain. Customer service is above average, servers might a bit more training but no major issues. Overall great experience.< /Text>

This restaurant offers solid good food.  I find to be good quality and taste for a chain restaurant.  It also has pleasurable atmosphere.  Service is generally friendly and can be good at times and at other times it is too slow.</Review>

This restaurant offers solid good food.  I find to be good quality and taste for a chain restaurant.  It also has pleasurable atmosphere.  Service is generally friendly and can be good at times and at other times it is too slow.<//text>

First of all, I was forced to give one star !
Second time here, I enjoyed it the first time, tonight I paid $16.95 for a burger fries and soda to go and what did I get ?

It was packed in a plastic salad container and not a stryofoam one which I know they have because I got them the last time at Mimi's Cafe leading to the cold soggy mess I opened 15 minutes later at my office, undercooked cold fries, my almost warm medium well burger was well burnt and becoming charcoal, the BBQ sauce tasted like straight vinegar and was soaking through the bun, my ketchup packets we're all stuck together with ketchup and the walk from the front door back to my van shouldn't have been enough time for my watered down diet Coke to go flat except maybe if you add in the fact that the dispenser must be off because it was a cup of soda water without enough syurp.

First time here was dinning in with my Boss Lady, awesome food and impecable service that time, worth the $47 for two and a $10 tip, this time and to go and Mimi's Cafe might want to take a trip to Mc Donald's and ask a 16 year old how its done right for $3.99, because for $16.95 tonight I hate to say it Mimi's Cafe but you sucked, and you sucked really bad, over half of the meal you had the nerve to just toss in a sack and take my hard earned money for went in the trash !

And to think I passed Carl's Jr to come to your place tonight, lesson learned !

Your restaurant was only at about 40% capacity and you guys couldn't get a damn burger and fries right ? Really ?

My check number is 110028, the date was 10/09/2018 at 7:10 pm and my server was Octavio who I tossed a $3 tip on a to go order to and I would gladly appreciate a your response here in this form, so, what do you have to say for yourselves ?

Cause like I said, my hard earned money, and I don't like having to work on an empty stomach.

PS, and now that I've scrolled through YOUR reviews, I'd say it's definitely time for some new and properly trained management and wait staff retraining, because Mimi's Cafe, your obviously sinking fast, and get your damn drains cleaned properly, because your men's room is beginning to smell like raw sewage !

My mom ordered wild rice and got fries, we got our meal way before getting our bread. We had to flag down someone that wasn't our waiter for cream for my coffee that wasn't even placed in front of me, but at an empty seat at our table.  None of these are really a big deal, but when we saved money just to come here to eat, it was very disappointing to experience this level of service.< /review>

<name>Valerie Robfogel</name><Text>I recently went to Mimi's Cafe in Fountain Valley by Brookhurst and Ellis for my birthday. The service was absolutely great! But I got depressed when I learned that Mimi's changed their wonderful French and carrot bread for bread rolls that seemed to be from schools or nursing homes. It is incredible that a French restaurant made these types of changes and even more Incredible that a French restaurant does not serve crepes anymore. I went there looking forward for my chicken crepes to celebrate my birthday and I found out they don't serve it anymore. That was a trerrible experience. And I'm extremely disappointed in the decisions to replace the original authentic menu to a more americanized "cuisine".  Luckily they at least still have the French Pot Roast.< /Text><Rate>4<//Rate><response>None< /response><Time>1534570196916< /Time>< user>

It was a slow night so I have no idea for sloppy service. Was not told about the days specials either.  Menu has very few original items.

< review>
I have gone here for years and today was the first time that I have been absolutely disgusted by one waiter and the kitchen manager. First off, my brother clearly saw the kitchen manager not wash his hands after using the restroom. After bringing this up to our waiter's concern, he went and told the kitchen manager our complaint and told him who we were. The kitchen manager then came to our table and sat down next to my mom, way to close for comfort and began to argue with my mom on how he did wash his hands. He gave a bs story and my mom repeatedly told him that she was just trying to make sure that her food was being handled with cleanliness. He kept on arguing with my mom in front of my younger siblings in an unprofessional and un discreet manner. The main manager, Tom, was helpful and understood the situation and disagreed with the way his staff members dealt with the situation. Overall I'm disappointed in how the staff dealt with the issue and I can say that I will not be coming here again.<//review>

We’ve been sitting down for the past 3hrs and our waitress April has been to our table AT LEAST 2 TIMES. And let me tell you it’s slow! We keep seeing her talking bad about us to her coworker. NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN. And the manager didn’t seem to care that she NEVER came to our table regularly. Poor costumer service!!!!!!<//Text>

3rd time, service was awful!!! HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!!!! Always the same waitress (Josyln). Chats with fellow employees the WHOLE time.😕  Drinks never refilled, order not complete. Seems so distracted/inattentive.  We're done with this restaraunt.<//text>

This place sucks...I should of read the reviews before going.  The food is nasty, service is worst.  Our waiter was very slow and our food took forever to get to our table.  We decided to take our dessert home and asked for the Triple Chocolate Brownie Sundae
Served warm with vanilla ice cream and topped with chocolate and caramel sauces.  The waiter came back with a to go box.  When we opened the box it looked like somebody just threw the brownie in the box because the brownie was broken into smaller pieces.  No ice cream and no chocolate fudge. I would never go back there even if the food was FREE!<//Text>

Me and my boyfriend happened to run into this place and decided to check it out. Its been here for years and finally got the time to come here. The staff here is very nice and welcoming. The atmosphere feels like a cozy house which I liked. But the food is alright 4/10  but I think it is way to much in price to ask for. I got the chicken parmesan one of the hostess recommended it to me and said its good. It turns it wasnt delicious at all. The chickens seasoning was to overwhelm it was to strong and every bite you would take it would just be a taste of  seasoning than the  chicken breast itself. And it was cold including its pasta that came with it. Overall nice place but I wouldnt come back its disappointing on how expensive there food is here and the lack of cooking experience the chiefs have here.<//text>

good casual chain, but not franchaised restaurant that serves comfort food in a new orleans atmosphere.  they are best for their breakfast, which tend to be less greasy than most. breakfast includes huge muffins that make the meal a hit.  the red potatoes are above average for most.  for lunch and dinner the salads reign supreme. even the petite salads can serve two.  the portions are large, but they will willingly split a meal for two people. always expect to wait - no reservations.<//text>

<Name>Winslo Cochico</Name><Review>The food was ok but the server "Lupe" (short, chubby lady w/ glasses) never came back to check on us. Did not even asked if we want water. When I asked her if she forgot about us, she was defensive and said "oh no,no,no!" Manager "mohawk" Richard was not friendly at all. Just walks around pretending to be busy. Very unprofessional. Corporate management, you should seriously check this location, that's if you care.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Wow. Did this place ever take a dive. What was once one of our favorite places for breakfast and lunch has sadly taken a turn for the worse. New ownership has slashed the menu to pretty much nothing and replaced it with, well pretty much nothing. $40 for three on breakfast - Omelette runny, my son couldn't recognize his potatoes, they would not alter the menu for us... boooo! Bright side? My wife seemed to enjoy her $11 burger.
Goobye, Mimi's... Gotta take ya off the list. Ouch, didn't wanna do that.</Text>

Decent place for breakfast -- Enjoyed the pancakes. Is always busy on the weekend, so be prepared to wait (tip: avoid the free coffee in the waiting area).</Review>

<review>We had to wait a long time to be served. The steak was not hot and the salmon was bland. Later on, our waiter told us they had only ONE cook for 3 large groups (2, including us, coming from funeral services at Forest Lawn.) Disappointing, because we go there quite often.

A bit pricey. Service extremely slow. Forgot about an item I ordered. Unnecessary wait for a table when plenty were available.<//Text>

Thanksgiving Dinner, they had run out of dark meat, only had white, which look like processed
Meat. The rest of the meal, was very bland.
Definitely not worth the money we paid.<//review>

The service used to be efficient, and friendly.  After my last few dining experiences, the quality has diminished; slow, unfriendly, inattentive wait-staff promotes an uncaring atmosphere. The creative menu is not supported by preparers who care for detail; cold, colorless, and tasteless food.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2c0e8737155ab:0x91f27b85190bded3<//GmapID></record>
