<text>I love Serenity Salon and my hairstylist Linda. Their services are always consistently professional. I look forward to my relaxing time there once a month. I also appreciate the cleanliness of this salon from the front door to the bathrooms. Today, I'm trying something new at Serenity, I'm getting my  eyebrows micro-bladed. I give Serenity Salon & Spa my highest recommendation.<//text><response>None</response><UserId.>114201939140423426259</UserId.><user_name>Teri Johnson</user_name></record>

<Text>I went in for a massage and it was so relaxing.  Wasn’t sure if I should get the Swedish or deep tissue so I explained my situation and settles for something in between and walked out feeling so much better. I forgot the massage therapists name and feel so bad about it. She was so nice and attentive. I definitely recommend trying this place. The reason it gets 4 out of 5 stars is because I could hear someone out in the hall taking a phone call. They do a good job of playing relaxation sounds in the room, but the person on the phone was really loud. I would recommend they hold off on making calls in that hall while the massage rooms are being used.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>I originally went to Tammy after purchasing the “One 60-Minute Swedish Massage with Body Scrub” I had to go back and forth to pick an appointment time due to my busy schedule, but had no issues and she seemed to be accommodating.  Once I arrived at my appointment, about 10mins early, Tammy greeted me and provided me a questionnaire to fill out.  As I was filling out the questionnaire, Tammy and a friend (or previous client) were talking about someone's recent death which I get it, life happens, death happens, but it really was a really dark way to start what should have been a relaxing and calming experience.  After the questionnaire, Tammy offered me two options for my massage, either the Swedish massage or a deep tissue. The fine print of her Groupon states “Valid only for option purchased” but still she offered.  I took the deep tissue massage since she presented it as a better option for the issues I was trying to address.  I found out later that the deep tissue is a lower value, so not quite what I paid for.  Also, during the massage itself, Tammy seemed distracted and her phone kept going off throughout the session.  Even if distracted, the massage still felt amazing and was much needed. I still tipped $20, which is roughly 18% of the listed retail value of the Swedish massage w scrub and 30% of the deep tissue I actually received.  Now, about a month later, Goupon popped up stating I might be interested in the Sweet Serenity Massage deal “Three 60-Minute Swedish Massages with Body Scrubs”. I was willing to chalk up the rough previous experience as just a bad day and purchased the new deal since Tammy’s massage techniques were more enjoyable than previous massage therapists I had gone to.  I purchased the deal and texted Tammy to set up the appointments. No response. Ok, I gave her some time.  Texted again the following day.  No response.  Third day, Tammy replies “Groupon is one per person unless 3 pack is purchased first time” and suggests I ask Groupon for a refund.  I am aware of how Groupon works, I have purchased multiple Groupons and know that if you attempt to repurchase a deal that does not abide by the offer policy it states “This order exceeds the purchase maximum for this deal.” I did not get any error and was allowed the purchase.  Also, since Tammy veered away from her own policy I thought she would still make the exception.  I explained that I enjoyed her technique and like she mentioned during our session I carry a lot of tension due to working a full time stressful job, taking care of two kids and helping out with my sick mother.  I could really benefit from a series of good massages and would continue to be a good client for her.  No response. So, even though Tammy really is skillful at her job, she lacks customer service skills. I don’t recommend her and will be seeking out that refund as well as a new massage therapist.<//Review><date>1564888013092<//date></record>

The massages are AWESOME! It would be even cooler if while getting one they didn't use the overhead speaker to announce customer arrivals. It's quite loud in the massage room and doesn't help with relaxation!</review>

The staff is super nice but they should learn to do a better job. My nails curticles was not clean thouroughly,  and its a rip off Nail Salon. For a  regular manicure without nail polish they charged me $40 and it was not done proper at all. If the lady would of clean my curticles well I wouldn't mind paying this much but I do not advice to visit this place.</Review>< pics>

This salon was terrible. I purchased an shampoo/conditioner combo pack for color treated hair, used it for a few days and then realized it was killing my hair. I called the salon, assuming they had some sort of procedure in place as I'm sure this is not the first time this has happened before. I explained the situation, stating that I had only used the shampoo/conditioner twice and was told returns had to occur with a receipt, within 60 days, and only for unused products. When I asked what if the product I had paid good money for was killing my hair, I was put on hold and passed to another associate, who I'm assuming was the manager, but was only given the name Carly, with no title. I was told that I could not return the product and she suggested giving the product to a family member as a Christmas gift, which was absolutely outrageous. I will not going to give used shampoo/conditioner as a gift and will certainly not be purchasing any more items from a salon that thinks this is an acceptable practice. I was stunned and horrified by their policies, procedures, and customer service. I would not suggest this salon to anyone.< /Text>

This place has went down the hill, it used to be full of laughs, family friendly that quickly went away. Stars pizza joint next to 7/11 was good priced pizza. It's over crowded these days with site lookers who are known to drive by on there mountain bikes in groups shoving the locals out the way. Oh and there's almost never a old white man pulling his weeny out to a girl of any color asking if she will play with it. If you have kids this is not the crowd to have them around. It is very clean now and I really hope the homeless who used to sleep there where taken to a local homeless shelter just someplace other than thrown into jail because its a income for a lawman</review>

Lots of homeless people hanging out, which is totally fine for the most part, but could make parents of children uncomfortable. The trash bins were also full to the brim and swarming with flies. This unfortunately means that eating at the tables nearby is somewhat impossible. (Unless you like flies for some reason)<//Text>

Its quite like a normal park but with lots of homeless people.
Nice to take your kids or do exercise but... Just be careful.

Have seen several "questionable people" in this park.

Some "pros" of this park is that it has a Basketball area, a playground, several swings and lots of room for exercise.

It has some bathrooms ( that despite the sign saying they open on weekends, they never do).

And a water fount so you can drink water I guess...

Wouldn't recommend coming here after 8 pm<//Text>

<review>Lots of potential here for this small park.  Just need to keep the 'wanna-be' gang members and homeless out.  Until then, only visit during DAYLIGHT HOUR!< /review>< Pictures>

Close to the house so we don't mind walking 2 blocks the only really big issue is that there has been an increasing number of homeless people populating the park more than usual there is also clothes hanging from the playground where the kids play bathrooms are sketchy always people in there doing their things wish the city or the Pomona pd would do something to clean up this park and as I was writing this review this second time there was a couple fighting and the dude slamming the door on his what appeared to be his laddy bad place to come or bring your kids</review>

Garfield Park.. I would want to give it ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.. Simply because its a park that represents the area...the neighborhood that not just I grew up in but still at age 28 happen to live in..  It has been a place to see go through the changes as everyone.. And im glad to say where getting better.. Friendly calm environment..thats ofcourse if your used to seeing groups of ppl taking time to relax not just kids playing in the jungle gym.swings.skateboards or what I like to call balance boards ... Yay. To me for them... I 💛them... Plus many more I just dont quiet know the name to.them all.oh yea We have a 1/2 BASTKETBALL court.. That personally it doesnt matter what time of the day or night it is.. If. I need to get away.. Let stress.anger.. fustrations..sadness..or simply shoot some hoops you name it.. I go there.. Yes it might be a park in one of the busiest streets "HOLT AVE" but its right in the center of many homes.. And its a  a home on its own to many.. There are always night lights for safety.. And maybe the restrooms arent always open & need some work..but we can always call the city and they come over very quickly to open the doors.. Theres a COMMUNITY CENTER right across the st.. That many dont know of..but its nice to know. Kids have somewhere to go do H.W. get help.. Be with friend's and have a Park they could simply cross the st. And be able to play with friends.. Well maybe theres many updates still needed.. But at the end of the day.. We will get them.. And we will use the resources given prooudly....Till Both places are used more together... Does any one have a. BASKETBALL..or maybe..A ⚽.. how about Board games.. Or a cross walk for the kids safety..maybe even more..< /Review>

Garfield Park is one of the hard-hitting heartbreaks of Pomona. Driving by at any given time of day, it takes only but a moments glance to fully grasp the visual dissappointment that lingers within the confines of this potential-saturated community recreation area. The lovely overhang coming off the parks tree's cast a summer shade that, sadly, goes unloved by local families and instead is occupied by a number of the cities vagrants, addicts, and drug dealers. (And please, I beg of you, do not mistake my simple-minded observations for a bitter cast of judgement. I try to maintain a non-biased, open minded standard and position; yet to share an opinion, I must either carry a constant dull undertone, or instead speak from the heart.) So, as both a local and a family man, watching this most beautifully manicured and plotted bit of land that could bring a sense of warmth and comfort to a community, centered around the laughter of children and the smell of charcoal through  Autumn nights, and hints of sunscreen in Summer afternoons....day in and day out I see, instead, my minds safe haven tormented by the very bodies that seek shelter within it, and not from weather storms or nature's fury, but from the communities wondering eyes, seeking out the hardened hearts and jaded maids from which society has turned an apathetic eye and blindly guided here. The grass is but a field of landmines in the shapes of broken, dirty syringes and ripped baggy corners, tied and torn balloons, and shattered glass pipes and bottles. The men and woman whom are not the park visiting sort use drugs openly and without shame or merit. Not even an attempt to make themselves unnoticed or inconspicuous to the outside world that borders Garfield. This park is one of my personal raw nerves (I'm sure it's obvious) and on nights that fall too few and far between, when the city empties out, and for a moment the park itself lay still and holds no beating heart, I walk alone through it's somber, silent paths and think, "If only..."<//text>

EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE! I used Upline to move from Sunnyvale, CA to Scottsdale, AZ and they were amazing. The most efficient movers I've ever worked with! They definitely know what they're doing. From my first call to my last, I was treated as though my business was valued.. that's not common. I also want to mention how incredibly professional and knowledgeable the team is at Upline. I highly recommend them whether your move is big or small.< /Review>

Broken Shelf Unit and Missing Mid-Century Lamp--
After examining the Bill of Lading I signed, and the formula to determine our reimbursement (60 cents per pound), it is simply was not worth our time to cover your company's carelessness. We miss our beautiful wooden lamp and our broken shelf unit. I waived the full-value insurance because I truly believed your words when I asked about your movers and the care they would take with our things. That was a risk. The guys you sent to our destination were ridiculous. The move was performed in the dark of night, and before I stopped them, the movers were actually throwing the boxes from the truck to the man on the ground! When I looked in the shuttle truck, everything was strewn across the truck bed, having tumbled over since there were no tie backs used! Even I know how to pack a truck, and I have personally driven our goods across the country without a loss.Shame on me for trusting your words. At the initial pickup point, I even asked the man leading the pickup if you could vouch for the guys on the other end, and I was assured that you "worked with your own people the whole way." Another lesson learned in life I guess.<//text>

I just finished a move from CA to TX (yes another one of those people) and I could not say enough of awesome it was to work with Upline moving. From John to Dale to the packing team in the Bay Area to the dropping off team in Austin,TX, everyone was extremely professional and made the move a breeze. My items took a week and a day to arrive in perfect condition. The unpacking team put every item exactly where it needed to be and not a scratch or broken item in the bunch. I had a lot of anxiety being a single woman moving across states, packing on my own and I couldn't have done it without this team. Professional, efficient, funny and dependable. I would recommend anyone to this company for moving needs.< /review>

I'm still in the midst of what I hope will be a good resolution to the issues encountered during my move. The packing crew was not professional and did not properly secure some items, while wrapping others directly in duct. AS a consequence, many items arrived damaged and others have duct tape glued on them, that is impossible to remove (glass door of a mini fridge, chrome legs of tables or sofas...).
The delivering crew felt very sorry and apologized. I spoke with Jeff York, the manager, who acknowledged this was not representative of the quality of service provided by his company, and guaranteed I will hear back from Customer Service for compensation. I thought that was reasonable.
The issue is that it's been over 3 weeks. Customer service never reached out to me and Jeff York is now ignoring all my follow up emails. This sounds like they will not own their mistake as they first indicated they would. This is very disappointing. This move was not cheap to start with and, if some issues can arise during a move, I would have expected Jeff and his team to live up to their words and own their mistakes.

Edit: 6 months out now. Jeff at upline never returned any of my calls or emails. Total ghosting. Bringing down the review to 1 star. I would highly recommend you DO NOT hire these movers in the Bay Area. Very nice at first but you are on your own if something goes south (and based on the crew they are hiring, chances are high).<//review>

I used them for a quick move that i waited until last minute to do. I called them and the sales person explained the move and pricing, and everything sounded doable. One the day of move the guys came and moved my items quickly and helped pack a few items for me as well. I was very happy with my experiance with them and would use them again.<//text>

I highly recommend Upline Moving, I am very pleased with Upline’s services. They helped me pack everything and moved us to New York during this pandemic, their rates are so reasonable and their work is very professional, the foreman is very detailed, there are no scams or hidden fees. It’s so accommodating to find reliable movers, cause everyone right now is trying to rip us off basically. The quotes are very detailed, office to delivery experience 10/10!! Thank you Upline. Not to forget I referred my friend to their company and I got a $50 referral check.</text>

Update regarding my review.
After posting the review, the sales manager gave me a call. It was a productive conversation.  I finally received the refund on the extra hours that I paid for.
As I mention before, their employees are nice and know what they are talking about and the movers are awesome. I moved to a new development, so I'm seeing other moving company and comparing them to Upline Moving. There is a huge different. We don't have much of little boxes, but our furniture is heavy (not kidding). Their mover were able to move them from the ground level to our 3rd floor through 2 narrow stairs with no damages. Comparing to other moving company, their mover needs to take break just bring it from the truck to the front door.
I'm glad that I hire Upline Moving company.

I’m 50/50 on would I even recommend this moving company to anyone. The movers and employees are awesome, they are fast, careful, and job well done. At the end of the move, we tip them handsomely. However!!! The company integrity is horrible!!! They wouldn’t unload your stuff unless you paid for however number of hours the lead is estimate. Which I understand I get it, but they will charge you one hour extra from the estimate time frame, just in case it go over the estimated time. Which the lead will tell you, the company will refund the extra hour that was charged. Lies!!! Lies!!! Lies!!! They charged me 3 hours to unload, which took less then 2 hours. Which the lead has promised the company will refund back. I waited a month. Nothing. Called multiple times, where the office people “promise” me I will get my refund back. Never happen. When I call the same number again, it went to another company. Then I called a different number, talked to someone. Same empty promises. Then they block my number.
If you have to hire a mover and you stuck with them. Just make sure they stay the hours you paid for. Don’t even think about getting your money back, if you paid extra hour.
They have 2 Yelp account, I’m going to leave the same review on the other one as well.< /Text>

Upline moving has provided an excellent moving experience for me and my family. We were in middle of this pandemic, and everything was just so difficult, even during these times, Upline’s work ethic is very professional and they helped us incredibly throughout the move. Packed and unpacked everything. We are very happy we went forward with this company.</text>

Upline moving assisted me with a recent move and I'm appreciative of their service. I had my items in storage for a few months but now that I've secured a new apartment in Castro Valley I called Upline to help out. They were as advertised. Fast, efficient, and friendly.</review>

So here's the short version: Upline Moving helped me with a very last-minute move, due to a water line break in my apartment complex last week. They moved all of my belongings into a new building within the same complex within 5 hours and they did it safely and without damages. These guys are life savers!!!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

My mother in law recently needed to move from a care facility in San Leandro to another in Walnut Creek and I heard from a friend that Upline Moving had performed a similar move for her father and that it had gone well. So I gave these guys a call, I did a quick virtual survey with their estimator Dale and he gave us a reasonable price. We got the move taken care of within 5 hours all in one afternoon. I saved my back and my MIL got moved.</Text>

<text>Okay this company is good but I never expected them to be funny. Aside from the moving me out of my Hayward apartment, into storage for a month, and back to Hayward, they have a warehouse manager named Nilson and he has a good sense of humor. And the reason I choose to focus on this is because after 6-7 months of being locked down, a good laugh is what I needed. Thank you Nalson and Upline.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808f95b071e8c5d5:0x7c65a362d12b9529</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I am writing this review as I am very happy with Upline’s Services. They offer some great deals on storage. I was very happy to know that they held onto my stuff for a month for FREE, till I was ready for the delivery itself. The experience from the sales department to the dispatch team, it was very pleasant and everyone made it very easy. It was overall a great experience to go with this company as I had no stress whatsoever to deal with in regards to this move. If you need movers UPLINE is the one.<//review>

<Text>I was very impressed with Upline as I had very expensive furnitures with a combination of antiques. Not to mention that I had a piano, that needed to be handled as delicately as possible, and Upline secured everything just like it was theirs. Very professional and dedicated team. They were on time and on task. From the office experience to the move itself. The delivery was on time. Thank you Upline.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808f95b071e8c5d5:0x7c65a362d12b9529< /gmapID></record>

<review>I was really nervous about choosing a moving company with my life time of belongings when I moved from San Jose to Arizona back in January. Upline customer service were very courteous and informative. The estimator went above and beyond to help me cut some cost, and even the movers were perfect and assembled all my furniture were I wanted it! I will be referring them to my sister who will be moving this summer.  I am grateful that my first big move went so smooth<//review></record></dataset><record>

So my move happened during the pandemic but everything went well they informed me of any prices changes and problems that could happen, what I liked about them was how informative they were towards me and we can make changes that I will need if it was to arise in the future. I recommend upline moving for someone who’s looking for honest calls and help<//review>

I am 7 months pregnant and our current home was completely flooded with plumbing issues, I called in Upline Moving and asked for next day availability, and lucky their calendar was open and they booked me right in. I had so much help from them doing all the work from packing and unpacking, loading/unloading, not only did they handle the entire move so smoothly but were great with our belongings too. I moved from Danville California, to our vacation home in Santa Cruz. I am booked up for moving back into our home once remodeled with Upline as well. Upline has your back from the start to end. Most companies start to ignore you once your work is done but with Upline this wasn’t the case, they checked in and followed up each day to make sure all my needs were accommodated for. Thank you so much to Jeff, Nelson and his team. They were super hilarious and made the move so entertaining and smooth. Thank you Upline for helping out. Would definitely book again for all future moves.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Upline moved my sister a few years back and she raved about them. So I figured that doing a local move with them would be a snap and it was. An estimator came to my home, provided me with a not to be exceeded estimate and the company stuck to the price. 5 stars for Upline.</text>

I moved with these guys back in 2015 back to the East Coat where I'm from. But sometimes moving back close to family doesn't work out the way you intend it. So I moved back to the Bay Area recently and again I used Upline. Since I hadn't purchased any new furniture they already had my inventory so the pricing was fast. And as always, the quality of their work was excellent.</text>

Upline moving has saved me from losing my sanity. From the moment I got on the phone with them, they have been nothing but helpful. I didn't know where to start packing from and had initially told them I would pack my own boxes and just needed help with moving. When I started packing I knew this wasn't my cup of tea, only 48 hours prior to my move, I called back in and they were able to accommodate me with a full packing services with a price that didn't break my bank and saved me from breaking my back. The foremen and staff are so kind and empathetic. They truly understand you at a personal level. Using Upline for all my moves. THEY ARE LIFE SAVERS!!!!!< /text>

Initial experience was good but it was very stressful when we were trying to get information on the drop off date. We understood that we couldn’t get a guaranteed date but I called multiple times and office said they would give us a warning when items left California; so we were very surprised to get a call from the local drop off mover who notified us everything was already in TX. Local mover they used was nice but we are still trying to account for missing and damaged items.

Do not use them for out of state moves.</text>

Moved about a month ago from CA to east coast. Finally get time to share the review and still hasn't submitted the claim for broken and missing items yet.

Overall if you have nothing valuable, and can pack most things yourself, it might be ok to try this one for the sake of price.
---------------------

One star for excellent pre sales service and update. Was very responsive regarding the request even on Sunday.

One star for the moving cost break down, no hidden cost and reasonable cost.

One star simply for help my family moving during COVID from west coast to east cost. So if this is normal situation, I probably would only give two stars for the move.
--------

Overall I am very disappointed or puzzled by the careless damages/preparation during the transportation, based on my experience of moving about every two years since 2004. And all items damaged/missing were packed by Upline...

1) Told by moving team in CA that customer rep would contact me regarding wall damage (very deep) caused by washing machine. Never happened and still no one contacted me.  And happened again when I told the guy on Monday to confirm delivery as well. Said someone would contact me on Tuesday and never did.
2) One of the child desk legs is completely broken, dangerous for kids to be around.
3) Master bed has one drawer is completely broken. the other drawers can't fit into the bedframe as they were before. The bed slate is damaged with no string connected any more.
4) Garage shelf can't be used due to missing parts for assembly
5) One of the bicycle's tire is completely out of shape. The other two bikes were not assembled due to missing parts.
6)Crib is functioning but damaged with chipped parts

The following two items did not show damage but I am surprised how they are prepared.

7) 34 inch monitor was put in a box with no cushion, wrap or sign with the side edge touch the ground.
8) 40 Gallon fish tank was put in a paper box with side facing down and a metal tool inside the tank.

For comparison, I had way more stuff when I moved to CA and had no issue with any of the items listed above. If it is just one item I can understand, but with so many things, I am hard to believe it happens to an almost 5 start moving company. I am not even picky about there was no mat put on the hardwood floor to prevent any damages during moving or none of the associate wears masks, or I can keep hearing the parts falling on the floor with big bung. Was the crew lack of training or too tired? Or I had wrong expectation on the services at this price range?

Now I am not only need to pay the deductible, but have to go through this tedious claim process. With the Covid, who knows when I will get everything fixed or replaced.

Pretty sure I was told they do not use subcontractor for the long distance delivery but it was not the case. Also got call about 30 min before the driver at my door, and can't get enough cash due to bank closure to pay all by cash...

Not sure it is normal or not, there were only two people unloading on the receiving side. It took more than 10 hours...<//review>

< review>
We have had a terrible experience with Upline, and even if you’ve paid a $50 deposit, I would seriously consider finding a different mover. The one positive about Upline is that the office staff is extremely friendly and responsive. The movers themselves are another story. In short, several of our things are broken irreparably, our TV stand was not (and cannot) be reassembled, a high-end wooden chair was damaged, our computer (shipped in manufacturer’s packaging) needed repair, and only half of our boxes and furniture were placed in their designated rooms, contrary to Upline’s marketing promises.

We hired Upline to move our one-bedroom apartment from Oakland, CA to Chicago, IL. We decided to pack our own boxes, and hired Upline to load our things, move them to Chicago, and unload. Upline promised that in Chicago, their movers would unwrap and reassemble furniture and unload boxes and furniture by placing them in whichever room we desired.

In Oakland, the foreman was great, but the movers were pretty roughly handling our stuff; I saw movers toss some of our boxes down the flight of stairs. The Oakland foreman would rein in the movers when he would see them roughly handling our things, but he was busy most of the time executing paperwork with me. So he missed a lot. It’s no surprise that this handling of our things resulted in a broken lamp and messed up the hardware in the computer that we shipped in manufacturer’s packaging.

One of the other egregious things I observed is with the loading/packing of our TV stand. I had loaded the cubbies of the TV stand with pillows and a lampshade and taped it off. The movers decided to unload the lampshade, and place it in the bottom of a new box. When I protested, the mover angrily dismissed me, assured me that the lampshade was fine, and then his colleague proceeded to load a laundry basked full of cleaning supplies on top of the lampshade and into the box. It’s no surprise that the lampshade arrived crushed.

The TV stand didn’t fare much better. The movers removed the shelves, but did not send the hardware for the shelves to Chicago. They also attempted to disassemble it, but failed, so they packed it with the frame loosely held together. On the Chicago end, the movers could not figure out how to tighten the frame again, and since there was no hardware for the shelves, they didn’t reinstall the shelves. Now, we can’t place a TV on the stand because it’s not sturdy, and we can’t even use as a bookshelf because there are no shelves.

One of our nicest pieces of furniture was also damaged because the movers did not bother to wrap the legs in a blanket. There is now a large gouge in that piece. These are just some of the highlights of the damage to our things; this is not comprehensive, but you get the idea.

On the Chicago end of our move, the foreman was extremely rude and tried to force me to sign to confirm that individual boxes and pieces of furniture had been delivered, without my seeing the item before signing. When I asked to see each piece before signing for it, he became angry and began to yell at me. I felt extremely uncomfortable.

The Chicago movers themselves (excluding the foreman) were extremely lovely and very carefully handled our furniture. The movers also apologized to me for the foreman’s behavior. The movers took great care reassembling furniture and made sure they didn’t damage anything in our building or unit. They began putting boxes and furniture in the designated rooms, but the foreman cleared them out when they were only half done. I didn’t even have a chance to tip them, so I left a generous tip with the foreman. Who knows if the movers received a cut.

In sum, moving is already stressful, and moving with Upline made things even worse. I’ve filed a complaint with Upline, which was directed to whatever contractor they assign to deal with moving complaints. I will update this post when the claims are resolved.< /review>

<date>1575741258550</date><rate>5< /rate><text>I recently needed to replace the flooring in my home and so I reached out to moving companies who I figured could help me move most of my furniture into my garage and an outside storage temporarily. I hired Upline and I couldn't be happier. Instead of putting my items into the garage, they offered me temporary storage in their warehouse. The move out and the move back in was a snap and thankfully nothing got damaged. These guys seem to do an outstanding job regardless of the task.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808f95b071e8c5d5:0x7c65a362d12b9529</gmap_id></record>

I searched online and found Upline Movers and they really helped out. Instead of storing my items in my garage Upline allowed me to store my items in their warehouse for free. They did a great job protecting my furniture on the pick-up portion and were patient with me in deciding where I wanted the items to be rearranged at the delivery. I would use them again.</Text>< gmapID>

I moved at the end of January and everyone was so helpful. At first when I received a quote I thought that they were pricey, but as I started packing myself I realized I did not have the time, patience or the energy to do it all myself. So I had upline come and pack and do everything. It gave me time to finish my work and take care of other task that needed to get done before the move and I got to say I do not regret it. The estimator was very informative and the movers were experienced and patient. Im glad that I used them, thanks again guys!</text>

I would like to acknowledge how Upline Moving saved me from being ripped off, I was initially moving with this other moving company, and they were too good to be true, they promised me with all the securities that I was concerned of, that all my furniture, personal fragile items, my artwork etc would be securely packed, and they would do all this for $80 hourly rate, as human as we are, I jumped right in on the deal and was all ready to give them my money. I had inquired for a couple of movers, and Upline was one of them. I called Upline Moving and they gave me an hourly flat rate and I was like I already have a company moving me for a cheaper amount and also providing me with packing services, Upline then asked me if the company had insurance, and on the move day there wouldn't be any additional cost? I was thrown off then, because they were offering me a cheap amount I never considered the other things. I then called the other company back and asked for Insurance verification, and they said they would email it to me, turns out when I did my research, they weren't even a legit company and they just vanished when I asked for insurance verification and licenses. I then called upline to book my move since they explained me the whole moving process.A huge thank you to Upline for protecting my moving, and not charging any hidden fees or being dishonest about the services. I would always move with Upline. Wonderful experience, amazing staff. just LOVEEEEEE them !!!!!!!<//Review>

<review>These guys were phenomenal!

I've had bad movers before - they took their time, longer than expected, some boxes were crushed because they weren't stacked properly.

Upline Moving was the exact opposite - they took about half the time I expected the job to take. Everything was wrapped incredibly well and packed into the truck well.

Can't say enough good things about them. Highly recommended.</review>< Rate>

I can't say enough great things about my experience w/ Upline Moving. They were professional, punctual, polite, and personable! I mean it when I say they treated my stuff better than even I would have! They wrapped up my TV like it was a National treasure, I never worried about a thing. All in all, it was everything you want to experience on moving day.

I will definitely use them again next time I move!!!</Review>

They did a great job! Everything you'd expect and hope for. They wrapped everything in blankets, taped up where needed, disassembled large pieces like the outside patio tabled and delivered it 500 miles away in 7 days as scheduled. Dave's crew put it all on the truck and Peter's crew took it off and placed it where we wanted.
Great job by everyone.<//Text>

< review>
I moved from San Jose to NY last year. I had no issues and thought nothing about it.

I just moved from NY to Rhode Island.  Upline doesn't serve this area, so I had to find another company.  They were horrible.  They lowballed me, and lied to me. It made me realize how good Upline is.

The company here charged me the same amount for a 200 mile move as Upline did for a 3000 mile move.
Upline gave me a cost and stuck to it.  They did everything exactly as the said they would. The NY company told me it would be $1600, but tried to charge me $1200 more the day of the move.
You don't need any additional stress on the day of your move.  Upline was wonderful.

I had no way of knowing how good they were until this debacle. I had to write this knowing what I know now.< /review>

The movers were great, on time, and finished much more quickly than they initially quoted. And they managed to do it all while treating our belongings with kid gloves. Watching them wrap, and unwrap all of our stuff was pretty impressive.

My only real negative is that there was a bit of a miscommunication between the estimator and the scope of the quote. The estimator made some promises about including some light packing services (mainly kitchenware), and the movers noted that these services weren't in the agreement, so we had a bit more cleanup the next day than we would have liked.

Still, the company and its moving team are responsive and get the job done. We'd use them again in the future.<//review>

Nice little neighborhood park with basketball tennis court and a recreational center. Children's playground has lots of cool stuff, swings and a sandbox. Lots to climb on. Slides and an upper area with seating. Great little urban gem.< /text>

Helen Wills Park has a lot to offer.  It has basketball courts, a children's playground and play structure, a sandpit for toddlers, and a tennis court all open to the public.  It's funny to see the tennis court (and sometimes the basketball court) covered with chalk drawing that kids doodle during the day.  The tennis court has lights, but currently one of the lights is out and it makes seeing the ball difficult, so be warned!</Text>

Safe. Clean. Local. Hoops. Open early. Closes late. Nothing not to like for a park that is right in the middle of the city.< /review>

<Name>Debra Wilcox<//Name><time>1380579761802< /time><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>This was our neighborhood park for 3 years when living in SF.  Great playground area for the kids, with enough stuff to keep older and younger kids occupied.  There is even a sand box area which is always a hit.
For my older daughter's 2nd bday, we had her party here (on the second level picnic tables).  It worked out perfectly.  Unlike places like Crissy Fields where you have to get down there at the crack of dawn to save a picnic table, we went mid-morning without any issues.  there are public (clean!) bathrooms on site.  Parking is tricky around there though with Polk street right there.  Another nice benefit is even if SF isn't particularly warm, the park gets a lot of sunlight and remains quite warm as its sheltered between buildings.<//Text>< pictures>

I have so many good things to say about this office I don’t even know where to begin. From top to bottom this office is elite status. The staff is highly professional and organized making every visit seamless and easy. I have been seeing Holly religiously since 2017 and have since had the privilege of seeing Katie as well. Not only are they both wildly talented but just awesome ladies in general. As for Dr. Wong, she is a true artist, an incredibly caring doctor and her advocacy for women’s empowerment during our conversations is inspiring. Every visit with her leaves me feeling good, as she genuinely cares about her patients and their results. I’ve never once felt rushed or over sold and every employee in this office makes you feel like you’re their only patient. Do yourself a favor and let yourself be blessed by the talented team at Gallery Plastic Surgery.<//review>

Honestly there aren’t enough stars for Gallery Plastic Surgery. If I could give 10 stars I absolutely would. The staff is very professional and courteous. I’ve been a patient since 2020 and have been very pleased with my results. I highly recommend Nurse Holly for threads, injections and anything in between. Thanks Holly!<//review>

What can I say, Dr. Wong and her team have literally changed my life! When I went in for my consultation for a breast reduction, I felt so welcomed and at ease that I knew immediately this is where I'd do my surgery. As someone who has never had a minor surgery let alone a major surgery before, I was terrified out of my mind! But the process from consultation up to the surgery was amazing, and I couldn't have been more pleased with my results-for once in my life I actually feel incredibly happy and confident with my body, all thanks to Dr. Wong! They were there for me all along the process as well as my recovery process. I didn't think it would be possible for any surgeon to give me results near to what I wanted, but Dr. Wong surpassed my expectations, and I finally feel like myself. Thank you so much Dr. Wong, you've changed my life for the better! I would recommend her and her team to anybody< /Review>

Absolutely positive experience from start to finish. My results are amazing. Would highly recommend Dr. Wong to anyone seeking plastic surgery. She listened to my concerns and expectations on the first visit and I felt comfortable going forward to surgery. I’m so glad I did. Dr. Wong is a very skilled surgeon with an artistic touch. I could not be more pleased with my results.</review>

Dr. Wong is amazing not only her work but also her personality. She made me feel so comfortable felt like I’ve know her for years.  She gave me step by step information showed me sizes, previous clients pictures,  which was very very helpful for me because I am a visual person. Keep in mind I had went to 2 other consolations and they just couldn’t provide me the information or procedures I wanted. As Dr. Wong was the surgeon I knew I wanted. Her coordinator was able to squeeze me in For surgery the following week. Her whole staff are very polite. I high recommend Dr. Wong. You will leave with a smile and beautiful results!</Review>

<Text>I recently had breast augmentation and internal bra surgery from Dr Wong at Gallery Plastic surgery and I could not be happier with the results. Dr Wong is an artist, and a compassionate surgeon who genuinely cares about her clients. All of the staff is incredibly professional and kind hearted. I'm a transgender woman, and my procedures from Dr Wong have made me feel 100% better about myself and comfortable in my own skin. I feel more complete, and I owe it to Dr Wong and her team. Cannot recommend Gallery Plastic Surgery highly enough.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>I have spent the last 15 years of my injectables experiencing life looking for the perfect injector who understand the delicate but oh-so-necessary balance of art and technique.  I have found that in Nurse Holly.  On the first visit she spent time listening to my needs, studying my face and sharing her honest thoughts.  The end result was the botox experience of my dreams!  She managed to achieve what no other injector has been able to and what I thought my facial muscles were incapable of.  An overall excellent injection experience coupled with a top notch front office staff.  Bravo, Holly and Co!< /review>< user>

<Review>Dr. Wong and her staff are very patient oriented and listen to all of your concerns. I had my first consultation at age 16, anxious and not knowing what to expect. Dr Wong made me feel comfortable and understood, even in the moments leading up to my surgery. She gave me exactly the results I wanted and I’m still happy with them a year later.

<Time>1553574213160<//Time><rating>1<//rating><Text>My mother chose Dr. Wong based on highly good reviews. It’s really unfortunate and uncalled for how this situation played out. My mother who has breast cancer came to Dr. Wong in need of someone to perform her reconstructive surgery. Yes, the surgery got delayed once by my her, not Dr. Wong. What you have to realize is this decision was hard for her. But we in fact finally picked a final date for this surgery to which Dr. Wong agreed to. However, today a little over two weeks away from her surgery we were informed Dr. Wong would NOT be doing the surgery. But the real kicker here is, she did NOT make this call herself. Her HUSBAND did, highly unprofessional. When asked why Dr. Wong was dropping my mom, he stated that Dr. Wong said that my mother “asked too many questions” “kept repeating herself” and “just wasn’t getting it”. This was incredibly hurtful, being that we both truly felt Dr. Wong was being sincere and understanding in every visit. There was no one else we wanted. This is completely devastating. Why would she not call herself and allow her husband? Isn’t that a violation of confidentiality? I leave this bad review because my mother and I are truly upset and at a loss with the next step in this. Dr. Wong, I expected so much better from you< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Brittany one of her schedulers made the appointment process so simple and smooth that I very pleased. They all are very helpful and efficient and you can tell they love to work with Dr. Wong.

The office/ clinic reflects the staff, well organized and attention to the patients exceeds my expectations, they are very kind and mindful of your needs. As a health care provider myself I look at small details and I am impressed on how they carry out patient care. Dr. Wong is a gem. She spends time explaining procedures to  you. She is very skillful and knowledgeable at what she does. I have been in top rated clinics in Miami and in LA, but her and the entire team are by far the best I have experienced. 10's 10's 10's across the board!!!!!!!!!!<//text>

I've had two appointments with the aesthetic nurse, Holly Siegel; lip filler application and the follow up. Holly was incredibly knowledgeable, gentle, and eager to answer any and all questions I had! Her precise touch and excellent advice resulted in my lips only being marginally swollen in the days following the procedure. I HIGHLY recommend Holly and Gallery Plastic Surgery to whomever I can! So happy to have found them!< /review>

She’s attentive and talks you through the procedure so that you are comfortable and understand everything that she’s doing. She’s very receptive to feedback and ensures that you get exactly what you want. Highly recommend her!!!</review>

My experience with Dr. Wendy Wong has been one of the best surgery procedures of my life.  She and her staff treated me with care, attention and compassion regarding my decision at 80, to have a previous experience 4 years ago, with abdominal lipo, which had left me bigger on side than the other and the Dr. who did the procedure refused to correct it.  I had the surgery done at CHOMP, with an anesthesiologist, as an out-patient.   Everything was explained in detail and I received excellent care from everyone involved, as Dr. Wong expects for all her patients.  I recommend her for any of your wants or needs regarding your satisfaction with the appearance or comfort of your body.<//review>

I have been a patient of Dr. Wendy Wong for almost two years.  She always prepares me for my procedures in such a caring manner.   She has performed each of my procedures with the highest level of professionalism.  I feel totally comfortable with the procedures and every experience is very pleasant.  Dr. Wong's work has helped me achieve the most satisfactory and state-of-the-art results.

Dr. Wong is the best plastic surgeon I have ever worked with.  In particular, I am most appreciative of her follow-up care.  I totally trust her and highly recommend her!

Thank you, Dr. Wong!</text>

<Text>Dr. Wong is an AMAZING Plastic Surgeon! She is so knowledgeable, meticulous, and skilled, but also has wonderful bedside manner. She makes patients feel at ease and takes time to answer any and all questions. Consultations are very informative, and do not feel rushed. She is the total package of skill and kindness, and deserves my highest recommendation!</Text>< Pictures>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Pics>None< /Pics><text>In preparation for a tummy tuck (after losing 90 lbs) I interviewed several plastic surgeons. Within 5 minutes of meeting and talking with Dr. Wong, I knew she was a very special person. Her empathy and clear communication are exemplary, her office and staff are relaxed and friendly but completely professional, and her precision in surgery is genius. Love this lady! As I was wheeled into surgery I looked up when someone took my hand, and saw it was Dr. Wong  with a huge smile on her face.  I was surprised to see her paying such personal attention to me as they got me ready for the surgery.  I asked why and she said that since I was in the operating room with all these people I didnt know, she wanted me to see friendly face as I was put to sleep. She stayed by my side, holding my hand in her warm ones. distracting me wonderfully, until the anesthetic  took effect. She was also the first face I saw when I woke up from surgery. She answered my questions and made sure I was comfortable. The results from this surgery are beyond my expectations. She is a perfectionist (such a Virgo!). Seriously. If you are considering plastic surgery, you want Dr. Wong!! Plus, her prices are all inclusive so no surprises.  GO SEE HER!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!</text>< Rating>

< review>
From initial consultation to post surgery Dr. Wong has been awesome. She’s easy to talk to and really paid attention to exactly what I wanted. The results were amazing. Her office is beautiful, staff is kind and she’s very meticulous in her work. Highly recommend you meet her if you are considering any kind of work done. During my first visit she educated me and "then" we had a conversation where she answered all my questions. I had walked in "thinking" I was well informed but during that consultation so much new information was presented to me. New information about the procedure and about my breasts. She did her job exceedingly well and I left my consultation knowing she was the surgeon I wanted operating on me. I am not a trusting person but as cheesy as this sounds "I trusted her" because I felt it was very important to her to do the best job possible (for me). She took the time to determine what I wanted and she truly delivered. I can't stop smiling and I can't stop feeling so LUCKY. I had an amazing surgeon through the whole process, and my confidence now is through the roof!

In addition, Brittany, Dr. Wong’s patient care coordinator, was SO wonderful, thorough, and helpful throughout the process. She is truly a beautiful soul inside and out, and has a passion for her work that shows. She put a ton of effort into working around my work schedule and making things run as smoothly as possible for me. She’s a wealth of knowledge and was/has been a wonderful resource. Britt you rock!<//review>

I cannot praise this place enough.  From the moment I am greeted, every single time, the staff is incredibly friendly, personable, and generous with answering any question I have had.  Dr. Wong is an exceptional doctor and warm hearted. I am beyond blessed and grateful that I found her. I have eczema and have had discoloration on my face.  The care that she put into me as a client was above and beyond.  I only wear make as an accessory now because it's not a necessity and that was after just one visit. I literally feel ... free. I am incredibly grateful and if you are concerned with exceptional work and exceptional hearts, this is the organization that will provide you with both and more. I've written a novel but I'm not sure it showcases my experience with Gallery. Thank you!<//text>

I called a few plastic surgeons to schedule consultations for ipl. This office is the only one that requires a $50 non-refundable deposit that can be applied to treatment. If you're bad at closing consultations, maybe work on your sales process? Not a good sign.< /text>

<Text>If you are looking for the THE BEST plastic surgeon on the Monterey Peninsula look no further than Dr. Wendy Wong! I would know because I had my breast implants leak 7 times prior to coming to Dr. Wong. She performed my 8th surgery and the difference between her and other surgeons as far as; results, recovery and level of pain are concerned, is simply day and night. She has immense knowledge, is extremely particular and has truly "gifted hands".  Her staff is AMAZING, her office is beautiful and it's obvious that she truly, truly cares. I wish I had gone to Dr. Wong from the beginning as I would never had saline implants to begin with - I would have silicone implants as Dr. Wong suggested. I couldn't be happier with the results and will sing Dr. Wong's praises to everyone I know - she's that good!<//Text>< Pics>

Her number one priority is money - not your health, wellbeing...or even outcome.      Moreover, she will turn against you - if given the opportunity - and is solely motivated by money.

While I initially thought she had done a good job of my surgery, it was determined by the results, many second opinions, the lack of testing for cancer (ALCL), and the records - that she was, at best, the wrong choice.  I am removing the implants she placed with an honorable, competent plastic surgeon.  However, I feel a duty to advise my friends and associates in Monterey, or anywhere else,  to not consider her for any of your cosmetic needs.

Lastly, watch the FDA hearings on the safety of breast implants (March, 2019) - DO NOT get implants and love yourself the way you are. Implants are dangerous but the greedy plastic surgeon will never tell you that.</Text><gmapID>0x808de4244fc91a09:0x9ca138cbf4c0f428< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Some services cost a little more than other doctors in the area but you get what you pay for.  I have used Dr. Wong for botox, lips and coolsculpting; she explains the procedures and makes sure you're ok with everything.  The office is clean and comfortable and her staff are awesome too.</Text>

<Text>Dr. Wong is the best. I had a Juverderm Vollure Filler Lip Line procedure. she did a spectacular job, i look 10 years younger. She explains the procedure and i did not feel a thing. Dr. Wong gave me a numbing injection that worked 100%.
I highly recommend Gallery Plastic Surgery, Dr. Wong to anyone having plastic surgery or Fillers.

<response>None< /response><Review>Had Botox done a couple of months ago and my eye lids are STILL drooping.  I called the office and was told by Bree Saldana, Dr. Wong's Medical Assistant that it the "droopiness" would just have to wear off.  This is not what I wanted to hear especially since I paid more to have this done by a Plastic Surgeon.  I told Bree that I went to Dr. Wong in the first place because of the five star YELP ratings.

Then, what I was told was absolutely shocking!  Bree Saldana told me that DR. WONG REQUIRED HER STAFF TO POST FAKE YELP REVIEWS TO GET NEW BUSINESS!  THIS IS DISGUSTING.  Read the other reviews as they make no sense!  Most are from out of the area and one even says they have been going to Dr. Wong for two years yet the doctor has only been in business since September 2016.  YELP promises that businesses cannot pay to post or remove reviews but there is no safeguard from unscrupulous business owners from posting FAKE POSITIVE REVIEWS.</Review>< user_id>

<text>(Translated by Google) Very good at what she does but very irresponsible in the charges to me, thick they sent her a charge for 2019 and an average year came, she believed that nobody likes that because you do not know if it is enough to have for your payment what you had to do each time because I asked what how much I had to pay and what was in it because my daughter worked with them and now that I no longer work they send me the payment I never wanted anything for free so I think that the personal is not right with the business I do not know they join

<text>Carlyn is wonderful!  She’s was very thorough and patient in providing me all the information needed in making a trade/phone purchase. She’s also a great conversationalist, which made it feel like a good visit as you can some times be stuck in a store for a while (not the case today! Was so easy!). She was very gracious altogether and invited me to come back and see her if I needed anything at all. I’m huge on genuine customer service, and this girl’s got it. Side note: She is a Master at setting the phone shields. She knows the tricks of the trade.✨😌✨<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Daniel when you told me I would like my Moto more than my j7, you didn't tell me that I would love my Moto more than my j7. Bro I'm originally from Atlanta and I'm tomahawk chopping the hell out of my flashlight 🤣😂 Awesome is a layman's term to describe the job you did and the fun I'm having with my phone. Thanks to you I now have to self-impose time outs 👀🤪❣️👍🏾👍🏾⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐(great pic huh? Yeah I know)</Text>

I have been a 'Sprint' customer for more than 10 years. After the merger to Team mobile,  it was time for my upgrade.  I travel to the San Dimas location because I have received excellent customer service.  It is worth my time because I know I will receive great assistance from staff who know the products and option available< /Text>

I won't mention how long it took or the disregard that happened. But As of today: those reps had added a tracker to my account for a car, been billed for it, (as well as the device- never got one) and then, there's no sign of the payoff made on the phone we went to pay off AND Ive apparently been making payments towards it too! I've had to spend hours trying to clarify unnecessary charges every 2 to 3 months. I'm done with this carrier!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Came in to switch carriers from ATT (which I’ve had for 15+ years) to T-Mobile for 6 lines. Harry did a fantastic job helping me with the process, making it easy and painless! Besides getting me an awesome deal for my new family plan, he was also very helpful in answering the many questions I had in a friendly and pleasant manner. I really appreciate customer service like that. Thanks so much, Harry!! :)</review>

<username>Jay P< /username><Text>Switched to T-Mobile and regretted it after 2 weeks. Found out they were charging me for additional items on my plan I had specifically told them no to in the store. They added them anyways. Checked my new account and saw those changes pending my next bill. I call T-Mobile support and they advised they took off those changes. End of first month, the changes are still there. Do not go to this store nor T-Mobile. I regretted it.< /Text><Resp>{'time': 1614096955761, 'text': 'Hi Jay, Thank you for providing your feedback and letting us know about this issue. We apologize that our service was not satisfactory.

<Text>The staff here is super nice and very helpful! I went in today to upgrade my phone and give my little sister my old phone but Daniel, our sales associate, told us about a bogo deal they were having so I was able to upgrade my phone and give my sister little a new phone instead. My little sister is so happy with her new fancy phone.

Always a great experience at Sprint/T-mobile San Dimas. Daniel helps me out every time I’m here and does a great job at breaking down your plans details for you and offering upgrades where applicable. Thanks for helping me save money on my new plan and helping me with the iPhone 12 pre order.< /text>

<Review>Omg daniel and eric are the best! Eric sold me a phone and gave me a great deal for he is very knowledgeable at all the current promotions and does his job at making the customer feel very important , for he never rushed me and was still able to help other customers but still giving me his full attention also I give him an A+ at his ability to multi-task. Then afterwards I messed my phone up somehow by pressing something in the settings so I want in and daniel gave outstanding customer service by greeting me at the door and fixing my problem with phone he also knows how to do his job good and its excellent at what he does because after explaining the issue he was able to fix it and did it so fast then he explained to ne how the phone works and help me understand better so I font break it again .i was happy because this store is very clean and follows all safety procedures due to covid-19 and I felt very safe and thoughts the store did excellent in following all the rules to keep customers safe . there was another man there I read his name tag but his name is unique so I will not attempt to spell it but I think he might be the manger idk well I noticed that he did an excellent job too and I love it when you see staff members going above the call of duty to give excellent customer service skills to the people that walk through the door. I once went to another store that is in covina and wow that store needs some training because over there they are very rude and would rather stand around talking to their coworkers then to wait on a customer and that has happened on more than 1 occasion that I was treated like that because they never seem to answer any questions u may have and look like they don't even want to be there but now I will always drive the extra miles to go over to the san dimes store where I am greeted with a smile and a friendly welcome .san dimes store staff are well trained and know how to help customers out and seems like they like their job by going that extra step to make sure the customer leaves the store happy and they are very smart too I will be going back for TV subscription that they now offer after overhearing them tell another customer about it . thanks for all the help and for never getting upset with me since I'm not that tech savvy. I feel like they went above the expectations and exceeded at making me more tech savvy so I font mess up my phone again . awesome store and incredible staff here.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Date>1603916175127< /Date><review>This was the WORST experience I have ever had at any wireless carrier let a lone TMOBILE. I went into the store to buy an Apple watch and the sales associate Harout was a complete and total disaster!!

First off for 3/4 of my transaction with Harout he was on the phone with who knows who(probably trying to fix another mistake he made earlier in the day) so was never ever really attentive my purchase. I informed Harout that was looking to purchase an apple watch for myself using a promo offer they have available. He told me they only had two colors black or gold. I told Harout I would like the gold.

Harout proceeded to process my order while on the phone with someone else. He processed my purchase without EVER explaining the new apple line i just opened or showing me the watch or even the box. I got to my car opened the box and immediately saw that the watch is a Rose Gold Color with a Plum band. ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT I WANTED.

I went back into the store to trade in the device assuming this would be simple and easy. This ordeal took over an hour, Harout offered to give me the bands. Off of his OWN apple watch, or split the $75 RESTOCKING FEE that i now have to pay in order to get an apple watch in the color I was sold on!!!!

Harout failed me at almost every possible point. The store manager HUETAN is evidently useless as well because Harout called him and “they could not do anything to help me”. I was told to come back tomorrow because the store manager would be in. I come in TODAY and im told the manager is off on Wed and Sun!!!!

Now I am stuck with an apple watch I did not want because the staff and management at this store is unable to complete even the simplest of customer service tasks.

DO BUSINESS WITH THIS LOCATION AT YOUR OWN RISK. Even if you get a competent worker the management is also decrepit so will be unable to help you any further.<//review>< Rating>

They said I had to activate the phone I wanted to switch to even though all I wanted to do is switch an existing phone to another.

I can honestly say this location has excellent communication with their staff, not to mention the staff by the way is superb! These folks really went out of their way in helping me upgrade my phone, it was a smooth transition and no hassle unlike other locations I've dealt with. I got into a new phone and everything was transferred from my old to the new contact and pictures.

<Review>Honestly had a fantastic experience. My wife and I came in to upgrade our phones and had  gotten help by Janessa. She was very informative and extremely helpful. We were able to work out a great deal that made sense. We came in with our kids and the store manager helped us make sure our son was occupied so we can take care of our phones. The team went above and beyond and was more than willing to work with us! Thank you Sprint of San Dimas!< /Review>< userid>

<Review>The store manager, Sylvia, is an excellent operator of her store. Her employees are well versed in what they are doing and will admit to their faults when a mistake is made even if its on Sprint's customer service and not the sole responsibility of the store. Many people have issues with Sprint as a company as I do but, they forget that this is just a store that is operating to the best of its' ability. Any billing and account problems is on the companies end. The employees here definitely understand that and will apologize for the company and will aid you as best as possible.< /Review><userid>117178731393677512070< /userid><gmap_id>0x80c32fae2e09a85f:0xd1f02704d1477cc0< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I worked primarily with  Joey, he was always very helpful with all my concerns and was able to  solve all my problems . I'm not one to really make a lot of decisions based on reviews because  I think  a lot of time people are already irritated and they write reviews out of frustration.

If I could give this place 0 stars I would.  In November 2015, we went into this store to talk about our bill.  My husband was on the iPhone Forever lease program and while we were there - he was talked into upgrading his iPhone 6 for an iPhone 6s.  Since we were on the lease program and they told us it would be the same price we thought why not!  We turned in his iphone 6 and left with the 6s - awesome!

We were SO wrong! About 6 months later, I really looked at all the details of my bill where I found that they were charging us for 2 LEASES!  It is now October 2016 and I am STILL fighting with this store and corporate regarding this phone we returned almost a year ago! Still paying 2 leases, unable to upgrade my phone because it looks like I have a lease, and overpaid my bills for a year. They claim to have new employees at this store and can't help us for something old employees did.  Now we have 2 leases, only 1 phone - multiple hours on the phone and in store with them trying to get help!

Better Business Bureau is next on my list.  Sprint I am a long time customer but this store is GARBAGE.</Review>

<Review>I am really disappointed in the customer service here. They were so rude to me and didnt even try to help me solve the problem. Previously a co worker of mine set up a line with them and bought the phone with no credit. I have pretty bad credit so i was looking for the same deal. After speaking to the employee for an over an hour, he refused to let us do the deal with no credit. My co worker told me that they just took a down payment from him and he was on his way. Its very unfortunate that they treat their customers this way. I am a paying customer and all i wanted to was get a new line. Will not be returning here.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c32fae2e09a85f:0xd1f02704d1477cc0<//Gmap_id></record>

I once took my phone in to have it looked at an issue I was having with freezing.  I was told that it needed to be replaced after they tried to re install some features.  I declined and took it to Best Buy, where they had no problem fixing my issue and informed me that there was never an attempt to prior to fix problem.  They handed me my phone in a matter of minutes fixed and ready to go.  No charge. As opposed $ triple digits Sprint wanted to charge me. I caught them lying about the supposed attempt in trying to fix my phone.  No regard to making things right.  No apologies.  When contract is up....changing phone service.</review>

Sprint is the worse... pay for insurance only to be told its the mother board and need to upgrade.

Days later I go back ... was told I have a $200 deductible. .. just upgrade! Was originally told I qualify for a discount - but the 2nd time around I had to bring it up. 10 years as a loyal customer...   at the end of the day, the insurance I've been  paying for - for  years  means nothing.  So disappointed.  Looking to switch ASAP!  I will never recommend Sprint ever!  Yelp is my next stop.< /text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>So I was told I would be receiving a survey about the customer service here... I never did and I’m guessing because it’s my moms account. Well I upgraded my phone here and you guys were amazing. The wait wasn’t long and I was greeted right away. Kyle Renae and Daniel you guys rock srsly. One of you had said that the survey meant a lot to you so I hope this helps. I would recommend you three to everyone. It felt like I had known you guys forever with the friendlyness of this store. I didn’t know really anything about the new phone I wanted and had a lot of questions now because of you all I feel like IM the expert now haha well you guys rock keep doing what you’re doing. Killing it !!!<//text>< Rate>

<resp>None</resp><Text>I went to this branch about a month ago to get a change of ownership with my friend. The pregnant girl that helped us was very rude and wouldn't answer my questions. She asked us for $50 deposit to complete the change of ownership, come to find out the line is still in my name and she processed the $50 as a payment to my phone bill. So basically I was up there for two hours for no reason and have to go back and waste more of my time because this can't be done over the phone. I don't recommend this branch to anyone! I've never been so mistreated by a Sprint associate before. Usually they are real bubbly and eager to help. Not at this branch tho. Go to the one in west covina if you can</Text><pics>None</pics>< Time>

If you have an opportunity to go to a different store please save yourself the time and grief and DO NOT go to this store. They are incredibly rude and not helpful in the slightest. They withhold information and don't seem to have any genuine care for the customers at all. I wish I could cancel my line and go with another company but I do not want to pay all the fees that would entail. I have such a bad taste in my month from Sprint now. As soon as my contract is up and I going to look into other providers.<//text>

Representatives are HORRIBLE at explaining how to go about getting something done. Not to mention their lack genuine care for customer service. Went in to complete a change of liability/ownership and pretty much wasted my time because no one was on the same page about how to go about it...and apparently the one person who was lacked the awareness that no one else knew and failed to provide courtesy and authentic apology for wasting a customers time and efforts. Instead, an attitude of "thats policy" was thrown in my face. Horrible way of dealing with frustrated customers Sylvia. I have no doubt you know policy but customer service is also recognizing where your customer is coming from and attempting to redeem yourselves from the mistakes that have already occurred.< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Everyone at the San Dimas store needs to be fired. Clean house sprint. They are rude they are not helpful came in there with a freezing phone and they just said you need a new one. Went to the Sprint store in West Covina they fix my problem in no time. West Covina stores the best they get 5 stars.<//Text>

First time I've had Domino's since the 80's, and it didn't disappoint. I had one of the pasta dishes, and it was very flavorful! Could have had a little more sauce, but will know to request next time. Site was clean, and the staff friendly and efficient. I will be going back!<//Text>

Just called them up to order another one of their overpriced pizzas and they said I was outside of their delivery area (which they've delivered to numerous times in the past).  I live 3.1 miles / 8 minutes away from their store..  I know I am being a lazy American having pizza delivered but give me a break.  If you're not delivering this close, you're not delivering to anyone and that's starting to infringe on false advertising.

Round Table said the same thing. Round Table has been losing people for years for price gouging but Domino's did a great job of regaining customers under their previous CEO who saved their company. This new CEO will probably send them back to the Era of cardboard pizza and poor customer service in dingy run down restaurants.

This company will continue to hemorrhage customers as it has done for years. Looks like we are making a salad tonight :(

I want to give a huge shout out to MIKE from Dominos! I ordered from out of town (10/6/19) and requested a special message for my wife and he made it really easy for me. He was extremely sweet and I want to acknowledge him! Thank you for going over and beyond for us!< /text>

<text>The man at this restaurant taking my order just did not make me feel welcomed. I will not be returning just because of him. He did not have a pleasing stench and even worse breath, I could smell it all the way across the counter and with all the delicious food cooking smells I could still smell it. Was just not a good experience<//text>< Pictures>

Dominos is fast food, let's just get that straight.  If you are looking for amazing ingredients, unique recipes or something you have never had before, look elsewhere.  If, however, you are looking for a low cost, decent quality, lightning fast and freshly made lunch or dinner, you've found it.  Definitely use the Domino's app, the coupons alone make it worth the sign-up and the pizza tracker is a bonus.  A personal tip: skip the default "robust inspired tomato sauce" and go for the "hearty marinara".  The tomato sauce is sweet and bland, the marinara contains big pieces of stewed tomatoes and enough spices to make it stand out.  The employees at this location are wonderful.  Fast, friendly and maintain order accuracy.</Text>

This location delivers very quickly with a hot pizza every time. They are consistent with their quality and the delivery person is always friendly. Love the hand tossed crust.</text>

<Time>1548534583353<//Time><rating>4< /rating><text>I probably eat here too much to be honest. It's on my way home from work and super convenient. I order online when I'm leaving (almost always the $7.99 large 3 topping carry out special) get to the store while it's just finishing in the oven, wait a few minutes for it and then head home. Most of the time the pizza is really good (at least considering its convenience and price) once in awhile I get a pizza that's not as good, or the wait is considerably longer than the app/in store display predicts but the same thing happens at all but the most expensive pizza places in town. Which is why this is my "cheap" pizza go-to. If you've been here once and the quality didn't seem good to you, I'd recommend giving them at least another try because sometimes it's pretty damn delicous.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>Drivers are friendly.

Food is often delivered later than the 35-45 minute window. Order tracker often shows an order leaving the oven then sitting and waiting for up to 30 minutes before being sent out for delivery.

Drivers (vehicles displaying Dominoes signage) often populate all available parking in the front of the store, leaving to patrons the more distant parking. Not a huge issue, but people have kids and parking lots can be dangerous for children...<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>The food is good but the meal preparation is poor. I must have gone to this place as well as foods delivered 4 times  the pizzas was undercooked, burnt or cold. Luckily, they replaced  the pizza. I could stop going to this place but I think I will give them a chance since they are new in town.<//Review>< Pictures>

Ordered a pizza tonight, paid extra for toppings, there were very little for what we paid for.  Even with the lack of toppings, the pizza was still enjoyable.< /text>

The food is good but i can't support a company that cut me out of their delivery area. I have purchased multiple pizzas from this store and had them delivered at least, once a week, sometimes more. Today I tried ordering from the app and it said they don't deliver to my area. I  called the store and was told they shrunk their delivery area. How small an area do they need? According to Google  I'm 5.8 miles(almost all freeway) and only 10 minutes from the store. Poor service does not get my business when I can easily call someone closer .<//Text>

Charged us almost 15.00 for a 7.99 pizza. And over charged us 3.00 on an 8 piece boneless wings which are nothing more than chicken nuggets.  What a rip off this place is. The cheese tastes fake and it never even melted all the way. Don't waste your time or money on this place. There were no prices displayed anywhere in this store or the receipt. I had to ask for a receipt after getting my order to find out if got ripped off.<//Review>

<Text>Horrible experience, the owners need to take more pride in their business and who they hire. First woman I spoke with over the phone was terribly rude and put out by just taking my order. Then once I came to pick up my pizzas I saw one employee (sophia) drop a ball of dough to the floor while stretching it, and pick it back up and continue fixing the pizza! I get it is budget pizza, but when your disgusting employees don't even have basic standards it scares you what is happening when customers aren't standing there watching.</Text><user_id>118334415039368638732<//user_id>< date>

I’ve ordered a few times from this place.  The pizza is ok, but that’s about it.  The last pizza I ordered last, was terrible. I ended up throwing it away.  The pizza was the ultimate pepperoni.  I’ve had many pepperoni pizzas in my lifetime and this one was the worst.  It extreamly salty.  It was  inedible.  Dominos isn’t known for having the best pizza on the market, but a pizza shouldn’t taste like you’re eating salt straight from the salt mines.</text>

<Text>This franchise location is two thumbs down!  They couldn't break a $100 dollar bill on a $45 order.  Messed up our toppings.  Huge bubbles, ugly pizza.  Complained and got a half hearted sorry with no concessions.  Trust me, they don't want your business.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Best new pizza place in town. Don't even bother with the garbage Round Table or Pizza Factory.< /Review>

Excellent prices for ordering online and good food and very fast service however the delivery fee is a little high when you live right around the corner and have to pay the same price as everybody else.</text>

<review>CURRENT REVIEW:
I am very disappointed with this location. The online ordering process is great but the customer service and efficiency has gone down hill. Most of the time it only takes about 30min for my pizza to arrive from the time I order. Today I called after my pizza sat there for 30mins and was told they only have 1 driver so they were waiting for him to return. After an hour of placing the order I called again to cancel. Someone different answered the phone...they didnt even care that I was cancelling, it almost seemed like a favor that I was. The cold attitude from both employees put a bad taste in my mouth. Hopefully when I go back months from now (instead of weeks like I normally do) they will have their staffing sorted out. What a complete shame.

INITIAL REVIEW FROM 9 MOS AGO:
Last night I called to order a pizza to-go. Firstly, I wasn't sure if they would actually deliver to my area as I live across town but, they do! When I called in and ordered it was a bit rough to get my order placed but I figured they are freshly opened and maybe have some kinks to work out, no bid deal. I was told my pizza would be delivered within 40mins. After about 45mins of not seeing anyone I called in to see the status of things. For some reason there was an issue with my order....Being pregnant I was extra grumpy about this. Gabe answered the phone and assured me they would make my pizza & deliver it ASAP [10 mins cook time & about 15 mins delivery time] as well as reimburse me the cost. I just wanted to eat and was pleased with his response. When the driver showed up he brought me 2 pizzas and a dessert! What?!?! He also brought another staff member with him who apologized for the inconvenience! I called Gabe back with a warm thank you and enjoyed the meal. Thank you for going above and beyond Domino's!! Awesome customer service! We will be calling again :)< /review>< date>

Nice lunch spot near the Carslbad beaches. A friend invited me over one weekend. I loved the Thai curry rice soup more than the sandwich, but both items were good eats.< /Review>

The sandwich and ice cream were delicious and service was very quick. The owner was extremely friendly and went out of her way to ask us about our day and about how our vacation was going. Cute atmosphere and the outdoor seating was perfectly shaded under a pergola covered in vines. Definitely a hidden gem!<//text>

i've been going to Linda's Yogurt & Deli since i was a little kid, and no other ice cream or sandwich shop can beat it! they have the best ice cream that i have ever had; in fact, my favorite flavor i discovered at their shop, and have only ever found it there. they also have sandwiches that are muy bueno and are more satisfying than the kind you get at franchise sandwich places. perhaps my favorite aspect of their shop, however, is their decor. the last time i visited in 2017, it was still as i remembered it being when i was a little kid. never change!< /text>

The ice cream was nothing special. I would’ve been better off just buying some from the store at a cheaper price. The entire establishment was awkwardly quite. Very little conversation from the employees, they really only talked to asks for what we wanted and how much the total was.<//Text>

A cozy little ice cream shoppe.  We get nice veggi sandwiches here for lunch, and sometimes a frozen yogurt.  Frozen yogurts and ice cream are their mainstay products, and there's always a large selection.< /text>

<text>Google says they're open until 10:30, Facebook says there open until 9:30. Showed up at 10:10pm, I asked the young man if they were still open as he was mopping the floor (I'm already assuming now that they're closed). He looked at his watch and said no we're closed. Recommendation: for lindas staff invite me back and let me know what your hours are while you're working, for Google you suck at knowing hours. Unless a friend invited me there I don't think I'd go back</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><name>Connor Towne< /name><gmap_id>0x80dc720fb2876873:0x1d28dd1c6f4d5b0< /gmap_id>< rating>

Good spicy food.  I love the chicken but the lines are long and slow.  But the wait is worth the trouble for some good food.  The employees are very helpful and are a pleasure to speak too.  If you're hungry and have some time to kill, I recommend Popeye's. You'll love it</Text>

Kudos for pushing 6-8 cars through the drive-through in about 15 min. This is consistent over a few visits so far. (Kudos for even having a drive-through to begin with and for a location near the I-5 in north county!)  My recent order contained tenders instead of chicken pieces (disappointing for me) and the itemized receipt in my bag was for another person's order (with tenders) instead of showing my own meal deal. The other items in my order were correct though. Probably a simple mix-up. Other recent trips were error-free. They are working very hard to meet high demand and doing quite well, but I hope mix-ups don't become a pattern.  If you're looking for a Popeye's fix, this location is a good solution.< /Text>

They were not equipped to handle a lunch rush.
If they can't open the dining room they need to remedy the drive-thru delay.
The chicken is great though.
The associate at the window was great.<//Review>

I recently visited the newest location in Oceanside, CA (Oceanside Blvd) with my Autistic daughter, who had been talking non stop about placing her order. She had memorized the entire menu and knew exactly which sauces to try.

We order through drive through, and confirm which sauces we wanted. Drive up window I encountered 3 employees with theirs backs facing me while waiting to be acknowledged for 2-3 minutes.

Get home to enjoy the meal and no SAUCE was provided in our take out. Not that it’s a big deal but it kinda is because what makes these different from every other place serving fried chicken is there special Louisiana sauces!

If anyone has met an Autistic person you can feel my pain about trying to explain why there is no sauce :( and yes I could have drove back, walked in and complained but I went through drive thru for a reason!

Disappointed special needs Mom</review>

I have now tried twice and im done. The first time, the wait was 50 min. This time my car and one other car were in line at 945pm. We ordered at 947 and waited until 1005pm. They came back and said " your order is going to 10 min". We were already waiting for over 15 min for absolutely nothing and already paid. They offered to give us some other kind of chicken instead but we opted for our money back. This was my second attempt and i live extremely close. Will not try again.</Review>

I waited fourty minutes to give my order, 8 pcs. Spicy thighs with a side of coleslaw. Waited out front for 20 min. for all thighs. When I got home I found four legs and fries.  I know they are new, but they have to at least get their order right.</Review>

I don't usually rate or post but this was so unacceptable . My spicy chicken sandwich was RAW , it can give me salmonella/ food poisoning. The ladies in the drive thru were so rude when ordering . 2/16/21<//text>

Been there 3x and everytime they forget some thing (biscuits, sides, entree) after calling to tell them about it they blame me for leaving without it and really speaking unprofessionally to their customers. When I have a toddler in the car so I get my food and drive home i can’t really just wait another 30 minutes in line for this.<//text>

<rate>1</rate><Review>There's no such thing as fast food when it comes to any Popeyes that I've ever been to in Southern California; especially this location. This place has lines as long as In-N-Out, and this place is about 3x slower than In-N-Out. Expect to wait 30 to 50 minutes for your order, even without tons of cars in line. Ive gone multiple times because I do love the food and price; however the wait is extremely frustrating and many times I still find myself thinking that it wasnt worth the wait. Don't think that Im being just unreasonable because this location is new...they pulled staff from other Popeyes who were already trained up and it's still unacceptably slow. I dont understand why Popeyes cant keep up with making a lot of food in advance and keeping it warm and fresh (somehow?) in order to keep cars moving through the drive-thru at a much faster pace. KFC can pull off faster cooking so why can't Popeyes? I get that KFC isnt as high quality as Popeyes, but still...there has to be a way for these guys to get orders out faster. If I owned this business I'd be looking into ways to drastically improve production, because it should be clear to any business owner that frustrated customers leads to a decline in repeat sales, and long-lines scare people away, and this means LESS SALES. Popeyes slogan of "Louisiana-Fast" has me thinking the phrase is more of an ironic joke than anything truthful. Louisiana-Fast must mean "half-speed" for the rest of us... Do I expect McDonalds speed? No. But do I expect to wait in line for 50 minutes when there's only 6 cars ahead if me? NO. If great tasting and affordable food is worth it to you and you have no place to be while having no idea how long you'll be stuck in line without being able to quickly leave if youre running low on gas or need to use the restroom...then try it out! It honestly is great food. They really need to fix their production time though; and that's an issue for every local Popeyes around this area. I've been to Popeyes in other states and they're super fast...so maybe its a regional training issue that badly needs attention.</Review>< pictures>

Absolute garbage. Long wait, no online ordering despite the fact that it's brand new. The sandwiches are not fresh and have no sauce. Get it together.</Text>

We asked for help on finding some earrings with one of the staff, she helped us look for a minute before turning around to talk to her friends that came in on her shift. We didn't find the earrings and went to Amazon instead :./< /Review>

<Review>Stopped here out of desperation for immediate coffee and was blown away by the friendliness of the employees the quality of the coffee and the deliciousness of the croissant, the vanilla latte was so buttery smooth and tasty the only way to describe it would be like drinking a hot milkshake and although that may sound on unappealing it is also delicious</Review>< Resp>

<review>Shortly after moving to Culver City I started to frequent The Conservatory before work in the mornings. The staff is outwardly friendly and they even remembered my name and regular order after less than a week. The drip coffee is the best I've had in the LA area and the pricing is well worth the product. Glad to have this gem only a few short blocks from my apartment!<//review>< pics>

<Review>On weekday mornings, the Conservatory is a popular coffee house with long queues.
Today, the wait time was 25 minutes at about 9:30 am.
Anyway, we keep coming here for the coffee and especially the scones as of end of 2018.

How has this business been doing since the pandemic started and a Lock down was implemented?
I am happy to report that this business is still thriving as of this Tuesday morning in April 2021.
Business practice has changed of course. It is mostly take out and not sit down.The staff is upbeat and friendly. It remains a very pleasant experience to be a customer here.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUyACjkknWzm2WVibAqq2G_znZb5YezfRIFOuY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhPN4WrWfUvFzO8EuVYgSXZwNPCxoZrZzl-4qK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOk1HmHe2Y5sfqCyHzrFcMz3WZoma-um0OqIrp5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5Khfi3RvPg5L40crLoUJmgtL47m5f54iX-hn6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkPxLytMdhU-jGaa95LuZncPjgpsHUqhLNqFgn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< user>

Always love this spot. Very business casual - I always see people working here in old town. Love the art they put up and it's always changing. The food is pretty good. The bacon breakfast burrito with avocado and tomatoes was great. Love the vanilla latte - very tasty.< /review>

Great pastries! The ginger, peach scone was well balanced and delicious. Great experience with their organic mint and lavender tea.💫🌷</Text>

< Review>
This place has a great location, plenty of parking, and really easy to find, in the heart of Old Town Pasadena. My friend had the strawberry cloudy and I had the Raspberry Cha Latte. Most milk tea shops have boba and other customizable toppings with their drinks, but Cha Redefine focuses on flavor of their teas.

For the pastries, we had the almond croissant and the raspberry Krof'n of Malibu. The croissant was so flaky and crunchy, I wish I ordered one for myself. I know I ordered a raspberry drink and a raspberry pastry, but what can I say? I had a craving for raspberry, and they filled the quota.

If you're in the area, make sure you stop by and try one of their seasonal drinks, you won't be disappointed<//Review>

Absolutely delicious. Acai is amazing, and staff is very friendly and help. Perfect snack to have, it's healthy and filling. I have tried other in the valley and they have the same concept but this one had more options for toppings. I love that it's all you want topping. Definitely coming back here.< /text>

I get the hype! It’s a great 2nd wave coffee shop with really good beans and amazing prices - especially on drip. Never tasted such a good drip - a Yirgacheffe that tasted like a pour over. Much better than SBux reserve clover machines.

Nutella croissant was amazingly fresh.

Excited for the pound pack of beans roasted yesterday to pour at home.

Ignore the 3 star reviews here - they look templated and created by a competitor with too much time on their hands?</Review>

<text>Excellent tea and coffee selection to choose from and delicious bakery items! The decor is rustic and old-fashion. There’s not much space, so you may have to get it to-go if you come during peak hours. Parking is also pretty limited in the area, but most lunchtime patrons have walked from nearby offices so you may find a spot if you come by car.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhO5pE2lFc5hJrsZKMY284HBHGmkBdV3vgbv8d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

This local coffee haven is so much more than just a coffee shop. They are the gaurdians of coffee and tea knowledge, that will guide your journey to caffeine and satisfaction. Nestled just outside of downtown Culver this shop is always packed with locals and newcomers. The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, and always willing to take the time to help you find the best drink for you.<//review>

<Text>Out of all the shops, cafes and restaurants in LA, I miss Conservatory the most during the pandemic. Best coffee in town (and I did try most of the coffee shops in LA) with great prices, a cozy atmosphere and super friendly staff! Can't wait to be back when all this madness is over.</Text>< pictures>

Arguably LA's best coffee and some of the best coffee I have ever had. Such a unique style of making their drinks and they always do it with a smile.< /text>

Best coffee in town. They sell other stuff there, too, but let's be honest, you know what you're there for. Sipping on 20 ounces of the Columbian blend as I type this. Absolutely delicious! Only knock against this place is that parking can be a bit hectic during peak hours. Other than that, no real knocks against this place. Next time you're in Culver City, and need a caffeine fix, skip the 20 Starbucks locations in the vicinity and check this place out. You won't be disappointed!👍🏼</Text>

The Conservatory sells their coffee beans on their website, and the delivery was amazingly prompt.  They roast their own beans, and have award winning blends!  Even during the quarantine, I am enjoying delicious coffee from the Conservatory!!< /review>

This is a very popular local spot for refined caffeinated beverages and freshly baked goods. I have only been here a handful of times to grab a quick brewed coffee and a scone (the apricot ginger and chocolate cherry scones are sooo good with coffee!). A pro tip would be to park on a street and walk over, since the small parking lot behind the store is typically full, especially because it is free. Also, if you're only going in to order a coffee and pastry, you can wait in the usually smaller line inside the store.</Text>

If you need help choosing a coffee, the staff are all very friendly and knowledgable. I've been buying their organic fresh roasted beans for the better part of two years and I can say I have always been greeted with a big smile. Everyone their knows the coffee and can help you decide what beans you'll like based on easy to understand descriptors like "chocolatey" or "fruity." Telling them your brew method of choice isn't a bad idea either.
If you want an intensely fruity, blueberry-like coffee I highly recommend the Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Natural. Ask to smell the beans and you'll be blown away. It's even better if they're offering that as the single origin espresso for the day.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP35Ct8cb3ZY3L-8A8xJQairjdhzTYmYDUTqsIv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

Best coffee and tea locally, I love this place. They have a wonderful selection of pastries (some gluten free and vegan too). Great atmosphere and the beans are roasted fresh, which smells amazing!
It is a busy wee place, people know when they taste good coffee!
Staff are lovely. I go for coffee and to stock up on my favorite tea.</Review>

This is a great coffee shop in Culver City. They roast their own coffee and it is as good as I have had around the country. I had Blue Bottle coffee and then found this place and would not go back to Blue Bottle. They made me a pour over with an Ethiopian natural process bean and only cost me $3. What a deal.< /review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>I blindly stopped by Conservatory on a Sunday morning because I needed a place to hang out for an hour before meeting up with a friend nearby. I was surprised to find the line out the door, but since I had an hour to kill I didn't mind that much.

Half an hour later, and I was still waiting in line. There weren't any free tables, and people in line would send other members in their party to sit down before ordering, so that was a bit hopeless. I also didn't realize that there was a separate line for regular coffee because I had spent such a long time outside, so word of advice to anyone just ordering coffee, you can save yourself some time.

Thankfully, I snagged the last zucchini muffin. The cashier serving me snapped it before a large party suggested ordering it, so I was pretty appreciative of her help. It was tasty, but the coffee was underwhelming and they ran out of their regular brew. It was definitely kind of annoying to wait half an hour for things to not be stocked, but oh well.

It's a beautiful space, but given the wait and the average coffee, I likely won't be returning.</review>< Pictures>

I don't like coffee, but there are only 2 coffess I will drink: 1) the coffee my wife makes (she worked for coffee bean for a few years during her undergrad so she makes it particularly for me), and 2) the almond milk latte from The Conservatory. Overall, the coffee shop has cool interior decor, a nice outdoor lounge area, and they're always playing great music. They are always well staffed and the staff is also friendly and work fast. But beware, the line can at times go out the door!<//review>

<Review>I really cannot get enough of the mocha here.  I don't know why, but it's my favorite mocha ever, and I've had a lot of mochas.  Get it iced with oat milk.

The line can be really long in the mornings, but it generally moves pretty quickly.  I like to drop by in the early afternoon so I can just pick up a coffee and go.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>Family-run, customer-oriented awesome little place. Super long line in the mornings, but there’s a back counter for “just coffee.” A couple little tables to sit and they always have GREAT music. Willing to modify to please the customer and always cheerful. A real gem of a joint!
Pro tip: if you have acid issues, as them to warm up their cold brew. They do it in the steamer so it gets the foam layer on top and almost tastes like a latte- but nothing added!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

I want to say this place in underrated, overlooked by the trendy blue bottle crowd, but it's slammed all day every day. I assume this is fur te sake reasons I, as a coffee roaster myself, go there: it's honest and unpretentious, and coffee is good to great. Best pastry selection too, if you're vegan or need gf.< /text>

Great selection of tisanes, coffee roasting done in site, vegan selections, cute rustic ambiance.
I gave it a four stars and not five because they don’t serve dark roast in the afternoon. Can we choose the roast instead?! Who’s paying?🙄

<text>Coffee and espresso are great here but there is always a line during the week days and weekend and never seems to be enough help or enough machines to get the line going. They close too early on saturdays and unfortunately are never open Sunday. It would be helpful if they had an app where you could call your coffee in ahead of time so you dont have to wait. Dont come to this place if you dont have time because it takes forever!!!!< /text><time>1578179380850</time><user_id>112163858531349918047< /user_id>< user_name>

<Review>This place is a gem. NO WIFI but who cares? They roast coffee in house daily, the staff are all amazing. The coffee is definitely one of the best. I have been all over LA to different coffee shops and this one makes extremely amazing drinks, flavor or no flavor, drinking the coffee black has a good after taste. You cant go wrong unless you're used to canned coffee from Ralph's:)<//Review>< pictures>

I don't want to sound like a snob but I've had coffee from places all over the world and nothing compares to The Conservatory.  You can't beat the variety of coffees offered not the freshness of the roasting.  Also, the "just coffee" line is genius.  AJ the owner is as nice as can be as are his daughters.  A great place worth the visit!</review>

<Text>Walked into this shop today and saw the line was fairly long; must be good. This was confirmed when i sat down to enjoy my cappucino and maple walnut scone for a bit of studying. The taste? Amazing. Coffee done right. Ample secure bike parking is always a plus in my book and the decor makes for a productive ambiance.<//Text><Rate>5</Rate>< response>

<text>This is a place to take the coffee connoisseur in your life!

This place always smells like roasting coffee, because they're always roasting coffee!

Daily specials vary from Italian to Colombian roasts.

I recommend the apricot/ginger scone if you're looking for something that isn't sweet. (The vanilla maple scone, for a sweet option.)

If you're with a friend, I recommend staking out a table first, as seating is limited.

Finally, park around the corner on Jasmine, to avoid meters ;)< /text>< Time>

Great local a spot adjacent to Sony pictures. Been around 20 years. Super friendly staff and ownership/family. Owner Aj is there almost every day and does the roasting himself. Pastry selection is extensive and good quality as well as well priced. Expect a serious line in peak hours and they're  closed on Sundays and all holidays. Love em!<//review>

I'm not super impressed by this place even though people seem to love it! On Saturday mornings this place is simply packed! Coffee may be slightly better than Starbucks but it isn't amazing or anything. There are many pastry options but nothing tastes or looks fantastic. I'd say everything is decent but I'd come back if the line is tolerable.</Review>

They have a separate line for people just getting coffee, which is good if the line starts getting long and definitely makes the coffee drinkers happy. Would definitely recommend for a drink and a pastry in the morning.</text></record></dataset><record>

Coffee is excellent, fresh roasts always. This is where i get my morning coffee from with a chocolate cherry scone! This is a homey cafe friendly staff attentive and quick. I love how this cafe runs and appreciate the hard work of everyone working there trying to meet the crowd every single morning. I wish this place opens a sunday so i can go 7 times a week, but i guess they do deserve a break.</text>

No WiFi, which I actually prefer because it helps the tables continually rotate open unlike some chains where they could stay occupied for hours.

Small and family owned, definitely a place that contributes to the culture of Culver City.</Review>< GmapID>

<Review>The conservatory is a TRADITIONAL coffee shop. They have no wifi, they insist of people speaking to each other or reading a newspaper. I like the vibe, it reminds you of a different time, when coffee shops served a different purpose. They have this rich mexican mocha that's a bit spicy, its very unique and i highly recommend it. Make sure to enjoy your drink there and ask for a ceramic cup. If you're going to do the Conservatory you need to do it right.</Review>< date>

I was recommended to try this place by colleagues and I have never been disappointed. I get the vanilla latte and don't like when my drinks are so hot I have to wait for it too cool down. Here at The Conservatory, the temperature is always just right. Let's not forget about the awesome pastries they have as well. My favorites are the cranberry vegan or banana nut muffin.< /Review>< rating>

<Text>I have tried a bunch of cafes in LA. This is by far the best coffee I have ever had in LA. The baristas definitely know what they are doing. It also has a very laid back vibe.<//Text>< name>

<review>their coffee is roasted right there. the conservatory smells like magic and joy.

this is one of the best places for coffee, and is a regular stop for me. the coffee is so very good, very reasonably priced, and no one there is even slightly pretentious. just friendly, helpful people.

it's a regular stop for a lot of locals, so it can get busy at times, and it's not a quick-in-and-out sort of place if there's a line. the same person takes your order, makes your drink, and rings you up. this can make it take longer than other coffee places, but it's totally worth the wait for the personal touch.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>It's nice having such a great coffee and breakfast spot so close to my house.The coffee is great, service is friendly, and breakfast is delicious although I haven't tried the breakfast burrito yet, which looks great. The decor is a chill modern rustic vibe. Parking is mostly street the surrounding neighborhood usually has plenty of parking.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c2ba2f308a3f21:0xe6bc11b42dcb0e88<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Finally, somewhere that doesn't overlook tea drinkers and provides as many options as coffee! I also loved that they had a removable tea strainer so my tea never had to over steep - greatly overlooked in most coffee shops since they don't specialize in tea. I liked the massive tea selection which you can see lined up on the back wall and would love to come back to try more!

Very friendly service, very affordable prices. One thing to note: there's no Wi-Fi so clearly, this is a place where they encourage real conversations (or truly getting work done).

Quality is 4 stars but the affordable price bumps this up to a 5 star place! Would be back more often if I lived in the area.< /review>< pictures>

Easily my favorite coffee shop in Los Angeles. Family-run and they've been around for over a decade. They roast their coffee beans in-house and have a wide array of tea selections. Their selection of pastries are also extraordinary. Highly recommend their kouign-amann.< /Review>

Okay.. So come during random hours (aka not during the before work or after work times) and you'll land a great spot in front of the place AND no line.

The next thing I wanted to try here was the Mexican mocha latte, but my parched self wanted it cold. And guess what? Ask and you shall receive. I LOVE that this place isn't pretentious. I'm a coffee noon but I love good coffee and the lady who helped me answered all my questions patiently. I wanted to buy a bag of coffee to take home, and she took me to the back of the shop to show me their collection. Wow!!! They have a lot of coffee and tea!!

I love when people have passion for their job and she sure knew her coffee. She was excited to have me smell the coffee beans and the one I chose was from Ethiopia and had a hint of blueberry and you could def smell that from just the beans!

She answered my upkeep questions and I left feeling more educated about coffee! Cool! BTW they grind the coffee according to what brewing device you use... Um awesome!!

Mexican mocha latte was delish cold, but I couldn't tell the difference between that and a mocha latte. I got the Mexican chocolate cookie too.. I could taste the spice there!

If you want to buy the coffee beans/ grounds, they are around $7-8 for half a pound and she said they will last up to 3 weeks in an airtight container<//Text>

<Review>This has been my go to Coffee Shop since I moved to LA in 2010. It has delicious coffee with a casual family vibe that's really nice. I buy my whole bean coffee from them pretty much once a week. They have organic options and everything is roasted fresh, right there in the shop.

The coffee is half the price of most 3rd wave coffee shops (Intelligentsia, Blue Bottle, ETC.) but just as good in my opinion.

The place is family owned and run and all of the barista's and staff are super friendly.

My wife love's Chai Tea Latte's and they make one of the best in town with real tea (not powder) and it's not super sweet like most Chai's. She gets it with the local almond milk that they serve.

We went in for a coffee, two pastries, and a chai the other morning. 11 bucks! It's hard to beat that.

Do yourself a favor and visit the Conservatory the next time you're in the neighborhood.< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate><username>David Whitaker< /username>< Pics>

I should have tried the coffee, but I didn't. Instead, I got the iced blended vanilla, which was good, but really really sweet. On top of that, I got a chocolate chip cookie, which was also really really sweet, so it was overpowering. Overall, though, this place has an awesome ambience to chill for an hour or so. The tables are a a bit crowded and set to the side and on the front patio. Not a place to get work done. It's too busy, and you would feel bad because no one else is working.

In any case, they have a large selection of coffees and teas, so if you're picky about these things, worth giving it a try. Really easy parking options. You can park on the street itself, or any of the neighborhood side streets have free parking.< /review>

<Text>The Conservatory for Coffee, Tea & Cocoa is where I discovered the difference that the freshness of the roast makes on the flavor of the coffee. The way the coffee beans are roasted here also allows you to experience the nuances of flavor produced by different growing regions as well as different farms and varietals within the same region. I buy my coffee beans here whenever possible.< /Text>< time>

<Review>Great little coffee shop with a huge selection of teas and a truly neighborhood feel unlike the giants that are everywhere now. Very homey feeling and great to come and do work in although a little cushion on the chairs would be a great thing.< /Review>< Pics>

The Conservatory is the only place to go in my book! Since AJ and his team roast their own beans on site, their espresso is unbeatable. Although I've looked, I've yet to find espresso/lattes/cappuccinos that meet Conservatory's quality. Plus, it's a family-run business with wonderful staff and friendly faces always.<//review>

Wide selection of the best tasting roasted coffee beans around.  I drive here to replenish my bean stock every 2 weeks from West Hollywood because I  simply can't find any better beans closer to home!<//text>

The coffee is wonderfully full bodied, and the apple Fante pastry deliciously lives somewhere between an apple turnover and those little butter cookies you get in a tin at Christmas.<//Review>

Staff that remembers you and are all very nice. They do not have wifi, which means people are talking to other people which is nice. They are not about speed, they take their time when making the drink, and it's totally worth it, just giving a heads up in case you are on a time crunch.</text>< Pictures>

I'm the 39th review and another person who will 5 star Conservatory.  This is the BEST coffee I've had in LA.  I mostly drink lattes and they do it right.  It's the perfect amount of chocolate mixed with espresso.  I don't get to go every day which is probably good because I really savor getting to go a few times a week.

On Friday I sometimes like to indulge in one of their pastries.  If you're going to go for a muffin I highly suggest the banana chocolate chip.  But, I really like to have a turkey and cheese croissant with my coffee.

In the afternoons you can indulge in a cookie or hot pretzle.  If it's a hot day, I highly suggested an Iced Toffee Latte!<//text>

I don't drink coffee so I opt for pastries and a pleasant setting. Their almond croissant is the best on the west! It can be more than a 10 minute wait in line to order, and another 15 minutes for get your drink on a weekend morning.</Review>

<name>Tyler C. Stevens</name><Date>1337621276074</Date><review>Great little coffee shop hidden next to Sony Pictures Studios. They have a blended mocha that could replace dessert any night of the week.

PROS: Cool ambiance, great coffee/tea selection, friendly staff.

CONS: Not a ton of seating, NO WIFI

TIPS: If you are just looking for a regular cup o' joe skip the line and head towards the back of the shop to find an express line just for you.< /review><user_id>115327814805326018412</user_id>< Response>

I've been coming here for the past 7 years, Whenever I'm visiting family in Rancho Park. Mocha is great, or latte. They roast their own beans. Try the espresso. And get a bag of grains.  Unexpected and welcome business decisions: no junk music, no Wi-Fi. Outside tables (on the sidewalk). Similar in flavor to Long Beach Polly.<//review>

It's all about the beans.

And I suppose the service and the warm, cheerful proprietor and staff, too.

Experience many different tasty varieties of beans.  AJ roasts them fresh on site, and he or his staff can take you through the different options to match your flavor preferences.  Compare to Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, where the expiration date for the beans is 6 months or more out.  How long has it already been on the shelf?  At the Conservatory, how about roasted TODAY, or yesterday or - say it ain't so! - two or three days ago.  My go-to spot for aa rich,  freshly-brewed cup, or some beans to go for the best espresso at home.

My favorites, when available: Ethiopian Natural (AKA unwashed), and Kenya Peaberry. Lots of other good options, too.</text>

<Review>The drinks are okay but things are pricey. My chai latte tastes watery. It was pretty busy and it seemed like only 1 of the 3 workers was actually helping customers while the other 2 ladies chatted.

Also, no wifi...didn't realize that until I had already made a purchase and sat down ready to get some work done -_- I wish places known for computer-work (cafes, coffee shops) made it clear that that they have no wifi.

Probably won't come back.<//Review>< pictures>

<rating>4</rating><text>A tad dissapointed about this place given the rave reviews, the staff are nice and the drinks good and  inexpensive for LA, but the lack of wifi is quite a bit of a downer and the somewhat limited amount of seating and the longish wait do mark it as a place more to pick up a drink than to stay and enjoy it. Seems more of a place that caters to the sony studios across the street than something really stand-alone.</text>< pics>

Rated the best coffee by coffee coneseurs. I took 2 coffee coneseurs who said out of all places they had been to in the world this was the best in all categoties. As for me, you haven't really had coffee until you have coffee here from then on it will become the rule with wich you will measure others. I have no afiliation nor do I know the owner, at some point though, I would like to salute his work effort for a great product.<//Review>

<Text>LA's best roaster. Not Third Wave Cool in any way. Just a crazy knowledgeable, consistent, intelligent, and friendly roaster. Early Agtron adopter...uber-consistent profiles. Honest prices for drinks. Excellent croissants. Cannot recommend Conservatory more.

If you think you know about good coffee in LA and you haven't been to Conservatory, you don't. There are a number of brilliant new roasters in LA. I know that. But David and AJ were world class roasters long before any of them could ride a vintage Bianchi without training wheels.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>
