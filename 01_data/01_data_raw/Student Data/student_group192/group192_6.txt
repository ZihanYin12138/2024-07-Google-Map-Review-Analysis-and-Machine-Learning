<review>Hi,
I was a guest at this mobile home park in April, and I got hurt staying as a guest. I ended up with a fractured
Elbow and I needed the home owners policy to get medical attention. I have had my elbow fractured in the home and the bedroom door broken as I fell against it. I have not gotten anywhere with this situation, I have a police report and 2 doctors confirming that I was hurt. I also have pictures of broken bedroom door and my arm in a cast. Since I have had no help I will be by to file a report with the police report, and doctors letter to this incident. I would appreciate attention to the matter and I know you have the home owners policy for guest getting hurt, I plan on using it for my medical bills pain and suffering, and I also have a personal injury lawyer to use if the mobile home park doesn’t cooperate. I will be by on Aug 5, in afternoon to formally put in the accident request. I hope you cooperate, the owners are ignoring this despite evidence it happened in the home, and this happened on  your property where my lawyer will hold you liable, if you don’t cooperate.
I’m never staying here again as I suffered a lot. I plan on doing a civil suit with the park and owners for damages after I see my lawyer. This didn’t have to happen had I received policy to get care, it covers guest who fall in the home resulting in injury, I still need an MRI plus  Physical Therapy.
I lost a job not being able to work due to being hurt in the park, I will be coming in office with pictures, reports, and police report for damages. This park is negligent in making sure people are cared for if they are hurt, I’m pressing charges on this incident of being hurt., I will be in touch, I’m remaining silent until I have everything from my lawyer and police to file.
You need to go around at night, when these things happen and people get hurt. Doing day supervision is not enough, and most accidents happen at night. My life has become difficult the last few months, with 2 of them in a cast. I suggest night patrol to break up parties, and people who shouldn’t be there and of course people yelling and causing problems with neighbors. I hope you at least cooperate since owners are ignoring this, and it won’t go away.
I give 1 star for poor security and getting hurt badly on your property. I’ll be in touch soon.
Please up the security before another person breaks a bone falling inside home, or outside with cars speeding over 15 miles a hour. I have been almost hit twice. This place needs to tighten things up.<//review>< Pics>

I don't live there, but my friend does. It's pretty kept up and what I suggest, more parking for family and friends.< /Review>

seriously. . .My family can't park on the street anymore. . the guest parking is a 10min walk from most peoples trailers, and there isn't a single tree over 10' tall in the park anymore. . . How'd you like to spend the rest of your days next to 200kV transmission lines?..<//text>

I've been here over a year now.  These old people are mean and nasty.  It's a click too.  Don't expect people to be friendly,  especially if you have a conservative political affiliation.   Oh,  there's a lot of rules, but only for certain people.   Especially minorities who have civil rights attorneys on speed dial.  Getting new management next month.   Not expecting any changes.< /text>

Nice park, but they will raise your space rental as often as they legally can. We've lived here just over a year and they've raised it twice. Question is, what do they use the additional revenues for? To line the owner's pockets, of course! Not recommended (for that reason).< /review>

The rampant nepotism practiced by the management of the community makes this a hostile place to live. If ever you wanted to see the smallest amount of authority that could be abused, simply observe the management.</review>

<review>This guy is the best hands down. If you want great service from an honest guy then this is the place. This guy truly cares about his customers and goes out of his way to help people and give them advice.

Never thought I would gain a great friend by getting a smog done but I'm not complaining because good honest friends are hard to come by today.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Jorge is a very, very humble man. He doesn't just treat you like a client.  He has a very good heart.  When I didn't pass my smog check.  He could tell that I was worried, and he even hooked up his smog machine without asking for a penny, but everyone deserves to be paid for their job, so I paid him.  Then, he babysit me through the process of fixing my car without asking for anything in exchange, but I kept giving him money, because of his good heart.  I finally past my test after fixing everything, and I look at Jorge as an Angel, because he didn't just look at me as an annoying customer who kept bugging him and asking him questions.  He had a smile in his face the whole time, and I felt like he was my family.  Thank you Jorge!< /text>

< Review>
George the man that did the smog is a very nice man, professional mechanic works fast but does the job right. He helped me beyond the smog, he seen my Ford Expedition  needed a part installed and he did me a solid. He gave me a good price for the smog.  Theres another mechanic  there that offered  to check my other car when we're available.  Goes to show you that theres still nice people out there.!!
I will let my family know about this place. Will be back every 2 yrs for my truck and sooner for my car. Thank You,
George

< Review>
Older park with playground, sports fields, and two half-court basketball courts. This facility also has a lighted Rugby field. There is also a large grass area that can be used for multiple sport purposes. Some trees provide shade near the playground and picnic tables. There is no shade near the sport fields, so watching games can be very hot during the daytime.<//Review>

I am very extremely excited to share my wonderful experience and give a shout to Eric, Danny, John and David.  You all made efforts to make sure I found the perfect town house and ensured my moving went smoothly. I want to take this special moment to thank you for being well organized from the beginning to the end. I was touched deeply by your humbleness and how you both cared amazingly towards my happiness and satisfaction. U made my decision even easier choosing you’re blvd👌Great work guys🙏🏽Continue being you and keep that positive energy going.

Cheers 🥂

<Text>I just moved in last week. I just want to say “I love it”. Give 5 stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ First of all, Dave, Jonathan, Danny. They made my move smoothly and quickly. Jonathan answered the email so quickly and professionally, Dave was so welcomed and kind, friendly, professional, also fixed my gate code within one min. Danny is very polite and friendly, precisely guided me on my tour. Everyone at Avalon Woodland Hills is absolutely amazing and wonderful!!! Also, building is so quiet and can sleep deeply. I feel at home, with a BEAUTIFUL VIEW! Security is very strong, the building is clean always. I love their strictness. I feel so safe. I received NEXT LEVEL SERVICE!!! And lots of palm trees and greens, great landscapes around the apartment. Also building is very special. I think a great architect designed this building. I see all patio is different size and shape, special exit stairs, etc. I can't find this kinda apartment building and room in LA. but there is nothing like AVALON WOODLAND HILLS. Also Ventura Blvd is eligible for “AT&T superfast fiber internet with low price. Everything is GREAT! I love living here, I am enjoying and grateful every day! Thanks so much, Avalon Woodland Hills! 😊❤️🎶🙏🏻<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Their maintenance team was always there when we had a repair and they took their time to fine tune things until we were satisfied. Most importantly we had to be relocated to another Avalon property due to personal reasons and Yoda Banker could have not been more understanding of our situation. Yoda was not only professional but extremely kind to our request. This property is lucky to have him and we were very sad to leave this property because of finding people like this to work with is extremely rare.

A little disappointing that we didn't have hot water for 1 day (move in day) due to an electrical issue with the water heater. But the maintenance team was able to resolve the issue and replace with another one. A big thank you to Pablo and Alfonso for a fast resolution to the problem. Appreciate it!< /review>

Hi Sidney

Please, if there’s a legally department, could I get their contact information to try resolving the issue friendly between us without the court & compensations for all things effected on my life after they an illegally kick me out and did not get me my money back despite I told the police that I’ve witnesses and all evidences that one’s of the workers at the leasing office was agreed with Hamoud to play this game upon me besides that there were two of witnesses when I gave Hamoud the cash for rent. Now I’m ready to get my right back if you’d like to meet me for looking on the appropriate solutions together or at the court as you like.

I’m looking forward to hearing from you ASAP.
Appreciate it.< /Review>

Neighbors keep talking so loud at night. There is people yelling and fighting. What is going on? I can’t even sleep. The office just lets anybody in. I told them multiple times but nothing. No change. There is also smell of weed and cigar that feels suffocating.< /Review>

Worst experience ever... my neighbor building 4 in unit 207 been having issues with his living situation for the last few months. the A/C in his unit is broken and when he contacts the Maintenace team to repair the AC he gets told that my he issue is not essential. My neighbor is a disabled person and they are taking advantage of him. I hope he files a lawsuit against them because now there is a heat wave coming to our area and he might suffer and get sent to the hospital. I hope I never run In to the same issue as him. I am writing g this review to help him. Poor guy< /review>

The most awful place I've ever lived at. Please do not even consider living here for your own sake. Paid $24,000 of rent in a year just to be left with extremely poor communication by the staff, broken appliances, broken elevators, and broken washers/dryers that were all left that way for weeks at a time. The office staff is inexperienced and gives their residents different information that is unreliable. Even worse when you attempt to call the office with questions, you do not have the option of speaking with a representative, you are immediately sent to an automated voicemail and they DON'T return your calls if it's an inconvenience to their business. Absolutely terrible service. Save your money and time, run!!!<//review>

Awesome! Amazing! Home! We are about 9 days short of our first year here. It is difficult for any organization to maintain a hundred percent satisfaction for a full year. I've read some of the reviews from some of my fellow tenants that don't quite paint a picture of satisfaction. Everyone has different expectations and different experiences because we live in different units. So I don't want to say that the noise is not an issue for them. However, the residences at Pacific City receive a 100% satisfaction reading from me after a full year. I still feel as if I'm living at a resort full-time. The staff has had a few changes over the past year but there has been no let down in the quality of the service. Someone at</text>

Omg. I am in building 4 there is a broken window in unit 207 that has been broken since November of 2019 and until today the apartment maintenance team are refusing to fix it. I’ve spoke to the gentleman that lives there and he advised me that he has been facing issues with the maintenance and management team for the last 7-10 months. They are refusing to fix any problem in his unit including the AC. Today is 08/15/2020 and we have a massive heat wave coming and this man is living with None working AC. Shame on Avalon apartments<//Review>

I recently moved into Avalon Woodland Hillls.   I absolutely love this place.   Corin was extremely friendly and helpful with the process of completing the applications and the move in process and with her assistance I had a stress fee move-in.   The grounds are beautiful, management has been great.  Would definitely recommend this location to anyone.< /Review>

If it wasn't for Jonathan 's enthusiasm & confidence,  in Avalon Woodland Hills,  we would have not chosen Avalon Bay. He called to set up a viewing of the property with assurance that this was what we would definitely enjoy calling our new home. When we first came to view property, we had other homes to look @ , but after Johnathan's remarkable tour and knowledge we chose to look no further! He is a dynamic leasing agent hands down. He is extremely professional,  friendly and made our move in smooth as possible!! Anytime we've needed his help he was attentive and took care of our needs in a timely matter. Kudos to Jonathan!!!

<review>Didn’t even live there a measly year ,

And get this , I left this place immaculate . Replaced all light bulbs , painted the walls , hired carpet cleaners , cleaned all of the base boards , washed the windows , I left that place ready for move in  and yet they charged me $750 to replace the carpets and $115 for a cleaning like we lift that place filthy ????? I spent a whole week off of work to make sure it was pristine . I am livid !!!!!!!!!!!

I asked for a preliminary inspection that no one could respond or follow up on . IT IS MY RIGHT , they said they would leave a notice once preliminary inspection was done but was NEVER done .  I had to move out quick die to my husband having military orders elsewhere . I feel like they took advantage of my deposit .

Beware when you move out,  they will rip you off .< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>My daughter and her friend lived in one of the apartments for a little less than a year. They paid for the clean sweep service in case they did not get a chance to clean everything to the correct standard, plus it included carpet cleaning. We just received an invoice stating that they are being charged for replacing the carpet so they kept their cleaning deposit AND are charging them an additional $472. This is a complete rip off. When they moved in the carpet was clean but old. They were hardly ever at the apartment so I find it very hard to believe they did so much damage that it needs replacing. After reading the reviews I see that they were not the only ones charged to have the carpets replaced. It's a scam. BEWARE!<//Review><user_name>Irene Meadows</user_name></record></dataset><record>

I am writing this to assist my neighbor in building 4 unit 207.
Broken AC since 12/2019
Broken window since 11/2018
Broken dishwasher since 2/2020
Broken garbage disposal since 4/2020
The manager is refusing to fix any of them and claim that those are not essential.
My poor neighbor. This is disgusting and a disgrace to Avalon communities around the nation< /Review>

They are always takes care of us, responds quickly and follows up so that we are not forgotten. I’ve referred people to this community and they love working with them too.

Each time we have an issue they are there to help if not the same day, it is the day after. This time it was Juan who was really brilliant to stop the alarm in the stairways which was going for days and we thought it was a parrot with hysteria at first. Then a leak in our car park...Each time we know we can count on their support and skill to get the job done and fixed.

<Text>It’s been less than two weeks and I’m already looking for a new place by the time the lease is up. I ignored the bad reviews on yelp because I figured most places have bad reviews and it’s usually not that bad. It’s really that bad. The process to move in was the only good experience. The tour was great, My husband and I were approved less than 24 hours later. Move in day is when it went downhill. The apartment wasn’t ready during the orientation. Broken doors. Missing doors. Broken blinds. Everything is beyond cheap and you can tell by the layers of chipped paint people move in and out rapidly. My first apartment I stayed in was for 3 years. My second apartment I was there for 7 years. So I was truly looking for a long term stay but I can’t imagine staying here. We still have a missing door that’s been completely ignored by staff. I even called Avalon headquarters and nothing- maintenance has told me twice they’d come measure and order a door yet have never showed up to measure. Our heater was broken for the first week of living here and it was freezing cold 50 degrees for a week before having the HVAC replaced. Every time you open or close the blinds at least one falls off and or the stick breaks off. One of the ignitors on our stove is broken and the first time I used it - it broke off and filled the whole apartment with gas, fire department had to come. It’s been a miserable week and a half. Many of the men in the building are so uncomfortable I can’t even walk my dog to the dog area without men within building grounds driving slowly yelling out the window. I have never experienced any thing like this ever. I’m super disappointed.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Athenna is a great person to deal with. I recommend if you have any issues go straight to her she is very open minded and her willingness is great. I have had many complications at this property to the point where I wanted to break my lease but she is the reason I renewed my lease because her customer service and personality. She should be in management she deserves it. They need more people with great customer service and a good attitude. I see why she sits in the front. She isn’t stuck up. She’s a very genuine  and a hardworking woman. And she’s very pretty!

To add on

Thank you to Avalon Woodland Hills staff and maintenance especially Ashley Cummings the maintenance supervisor. She heard what I was concerned with , listened and took care of everything that I mentioned to her. Her willingness to help after many times of me coming to the office. She was able to make things happen in a fast and timely manner and went over and beyond . Thank you Ashley for all your help and listening to me and making things better! I am now happy with my apartment . Great customer service by her .</Review>

Great apartment, solid location, and a staff that really cares about residents -- I like coming home here. But it really is the people that make everything worthwhile. I like the residents and staff, and Chantalle (supervisor) in particular is wonderful. She remembers the smallest details, asks after my dog, and always wants to know if there's anything more she could be doing. There are many people who live here and work here,  but somehow Chantalle makes us feel really special.  Thank you!<//review>

But now they are charging me thousands of dollars when I move out and that's after days of cleaning!!!! Cockroaches exist when we move in and they hide behind the refrigerator. There is no way to tell they exist when I move in!! Or maybe you need to inspect everywhere. But they are charging $300 for pest control!!! That's crazy. Not mentioning $800 for carpet replacement as there is stain in the carpet. When I dispute the charges, they said these all stated in your lease! So you need to read every words carefully on the lease! Because they will steal your money based on these words! DO NOT CHOOSE AVALON!</review>< Pictures>

<Review>We recently moved into Avalon . I have to say so far everything has been top notch. The leasing agent Athena was wonderful from our first day meeting with her. She helped us with all of our questions and inquires and made sure we had a smooth and easy move in. The staff on the property are super friendly and helpful. Would recommend this community to anyone looking to make a move to a great community.<//Review>< Pictures>

I would like to recommend Daniel Morales, Community Consultant at Avalon Woodland Hills, for his excellent customer service.  Daniel is friendly greeting customers with smiles.  He is attentive to the requests of the residents and is helpful when they have questions.  I wish there are more leasing consultants like Daniel in this Avalon office.  Ask for Daniel if you are interesting in this property.  He is the best.</text>

My wife was resident of this apartment about four years and she never seen this problem before. Long story short, the apartment management decided to towing cars from visitors parking without any warnings. I don’t want to tell park tenants cars in that spot is ok, but it becomes norms after many years for all residents or their guests to park cars there peacefully. However, I changed my plan to stay here longer and I never renew my lease. The only thing I got here is they don’t care about their rates and reviews. So, better be think about it before moving here, you never going to get the value which you paid for it😢</text>

<review>DO NOT MOVE HERE! I purchased the move-out cleaning service and now I'm being charged $1000 because of pet hair. Avalon of Woodland Hills took pictures of the carpet with pet hair on it, and they decided to rip up the carpet and replace. I ask you, HOW DOES THE CLEANING FEE NOT ENCOMPASS BASIC VACUUMING? Corporate employees have straight up told me 'It is what it is...' Now THAT'S great customer service. Oh, and they wouldn't let us speak to a manager. SERIOUSLY?! I cannot believe this at all. We paid for cleaning because the leasing office PUSHED it on us. The leasing employee upon walkthrough said there was NO VISIBLE DAMAGE (and he referred to our carpets as well). I could have easily vacuumed the apartment. The rugs were not damaged, they had hair on them. This is ridiculous and an abuse of power. Other than this complete cr*p -- I've seen two dead rats in the middle of our community, and one very much live one. We've had someone sh*t on the the stairs leading up to the gated complex twice (which isn't gated very well because the doors are always busted). And we've had a junkie spend the night right outside our (again "gated") apartment. A stone's throw away from our sleeping baby.

Juan Franco on the Maintenance Team has been amazing! He has serviced my unit on several occasions from plumbing, air-conditioning, etc to being an advocate for us when it came to upgrading my floors to hardwood.  He has a wealth of experience that includes electro-mechanical which deemed to come in handy when servicing my refrigerator recently. Juan is always very prompt with mitigating issues with the interior and exterior of the apartment. He is also great with follow-ups if for some reason a part needs to be ordered and the work cant be completed same day.  Juan has provided a high level of service and I appreciate his calm and cheerful demeanor even in my most irate moments.< /review>

I’ve had issues with the leasing department and their maintenance manager. I sent an email out about construction noise/times and got a canned response. So I had to go the leasing office 3 times in one day (don’t go at 9:30 am when the official is officially open, because there will be a sign that says it’s closed, or at least in my experience). When I came in to speak to Daniel Morales it was clear he didn’t read the most recent email I sent hours before. I had also spoken to another leasing agent that said Daniel would call me back at a certain time, and he didn’t. In addition, the third time I went to the leasing office, I spoke to the maintenance manager and she gave me grief for seeking out an additional 30 minutes of sleep (to go in line with the initial letter sent of construction times) and she sad verbatim:  “Really, an extra 30 minutes of sleep is going to make a difference to you?”

Also the elevators in building 7 have an expired elevator certificate dating back to 2017 (seemingly coinciding with the multiple issues its had), so rider beware.< /Text>

I moved in to this community two months ago and so far everything is great. The leasing office is always there to help when I need them. Specially Athenna and Daniel, these have so much positive energy! Today they help with calling clarifying lots of questions that I had regarding my bills and mail services.

I would recommend this place to anyone!<//review>

I have just renewed my lease with Avalon. My first year here went really well. I had a lot of support from Shauntel and Athena. They were more than helpful with answering all of my questions and assisting me with moving into a bigger unit. During my first year at the Avalon I can say that it was a great experience. The Avalon is a dog friendly building with great staff. My neighbors were always friendly as well. It was a great enough experience for me to renew my lease and stay another year. Thank you so much to the Avalon staff, you guys are great!<//review>

<text>If you value your safety and piece of mind STAY AWAY!!!! I’ve lived in the complex since June 2018 and my car has been egged multiple times. The first time I reported it I received a $50 credit to my account and an apology. The last time, last week I was again presented with an apology and a notice that they’re going to review the camera footage. I haven’t heard anything back so I decided to email the manager as well as write reviews so people know just how this overpriced “luxury” safe complex really is and if I can reach the headquarters I’m going to ensure they know as well. This is utterly rediculous for a place charging almost $3K a month. The access gate may as well not even be there because people sit, wait, and follow someone into the grounds. There’s no accountability at all unless you wish to break your lease because of what clearly has the potential to be a hate crime. No one should be required to stay somewhere they don’t feel safe and especially if no one does anything about it. I’m afraid for my safety, on the bottom floor where people walk past my bedroom and guest room windows. I double check the stairway before walking up and I’m constantly on guard. I’ve had to train my dogs to use pads to relieve themselves for fear of walking around in the dark alone. I’m used to businesses taking care of patrons and attempting to correct issues and this has not happened with my experience here. If I could leave a negative star rating I would because I can’t wait until my jailtime here is OVER!!!</text>< Rating>

Totally a disaster when you want to leave. So many charges. Hundreds dollars for pest control, and another hundreds dollars for cleaning, even though you have cleaned the apartment again and again and again before you leave. They can always find a way to charge you no matter what you did. DO NOT CHOOSE AVALON! NEVER!!!!!!<//review>

<text>Most of the staff is completely unaware of what their responsibilities are. I've had one positive interaction with a staff member, and even that one didn't appropriately handle concerns. Building smells like pot, no one cleans up after their animals and management is about as poor as I have ever encountered.
Current manager is somewhat responsible. The rest of the staff that I have encountered I would absolutely let go of immediately.<//text>< Pics>

I love Avalon Woodland Hills a lot.  Environment is lovely, staff is friendly, facilities and amenities are good.  More importantly, the maintenance staff, in particular, George, has always been helpful, responsive, and with a cheerful positive attitude to all the residents, which has made our stay an even better experience.  Thank you George!<//Text>

Don't move here!
This is the worst Avalon Ever!
I used to live in Avalon Pasadena and Avalon Encino, the both were great! But here.... Not At alllll
Crickets every corner of the apartment !Place filled with dog poop and urine! Noisy neighbors! Employees in the office don't care about residents (specially Daniel)
just the maintenance team are good!
The luxury apartment just a joke:))
Fortunately I moved out and Definitely not recommended!< /Text>

< Review>
This is the worst place I have lived in. I was pinned down and another tenant tried to rape me. I was next pulled out of my apartment and almost stabbed in the neck. Avalon did nothing although I made a police report and I took the knife in. The police established assault with a deadly weapon. They people lived and or still live upstairs nothing happened to them at all.
Michelle a so called manager cornered me when I was leaving with her associate and were very rude and forceful with me and I was attacked. On top of that there were 6 witnesses.
To top it off my car was stolen from my parking space 5 weeks ago by a gang member.
I do not recommend living here. The hallways smell like pee and this is supposed to be non-smoking I smell cigarettes daily and cigarette butts all over. The management here is the worst I have encountered.

Yes I am moving. Do not recommend.< /Review>

I have lived here for 2 years 2014-2016 Stacey A. Is Awesome we had an amazing office staff but most of them were moved to other properties I am glad Stacey is still here. Pros of living here.
- Kept very clean / fast emergency maintenance response
- Landscaping well kept
- Friendly office staff./ maintenance staff
- Nice pool / Gym
Cons of living here
- Cars getting broken into often/ theft from patios / mail boxes
- parking situation sucks (tow trucks have seriously towed the wrong people)
- plumbing, electric, front gate problems
-Could use security cameras<//Text>

I am primarily disappointed with the safety in this community. Car Break-ins are frequent. The management just says "very sorry about this" and does nothing much to improve the situation. Rents are so high and apparently security is "courtesy patrol" I want to live in a secure space especially when im paying so much every month. Security is quite sluggish. I see suspicious people walking /cars driving around the community without any check.<//Review>

Avalon has everything I needed in an apartment. Well maintained and excellent response rate to any concern. Good neighbors, close to everything, great amenities, etc. The on site staff are smart and friendly and helpful. The courtesy patrol is a must.< /text>

For the 1st 2 years of my stay I was pretty happy with how things were going I will say maintenance is on top of getting things fixed when requested the amenities in the building are awesome but ther are definitely some downsides to living here 1st I will discuss how management does little to make sure residents are happy my personal storage in the building was broken into last year and it took them four days to change the Broken lock to my storage Because I didn't have a police report yet never were they apologetic or caring that $1500 worth the bikes were stolen from my storage I let that go...recently after living here for 3 years and requesting a parking space in my own building from day one and was told there was no available spaces and no waiting list I watched 3 people in my hallway including someone I referred to the apartment get spaces in my building And after explaining to them the safety concerns of having to cross a major driveway with no stop signs with my 3 kids and almost being hit on numerous occasion they inform me that there were 2 spaces available and that they would submit it for approval and I could use the spaced until approved after 3 weeks I was told that I wasn't approved Because I received a discounted rate when I moved in and saved $30 after explaining to them that actually the $30 I saved the 1st year They added to my remt increase the 2nd year making my rent increase a $150 the 2nd year I moved and a $120 each  Following year They then told me that it was out of their hands.... after contacting Avalon Bay customer service I was told it is actually up to the  Management at the building.When I contacted management again they then told me that the parking spot was previously given away to a tenant on floor 3  And that I would be put on a waiting list. It's pretty ridiculous that a tenet of 3 years would be put on the back burner compared to Tenets that just moved in ....How does someone I refer to mov in get a space in the same building 6 months after moving in and I'm just being placed on a waiting list ....I'm very disappointed with the way management has handle these situations besides the constant lies  And run around that I have been fed....it feels like your just here to pay rent and they could care less if you are unhappy and move out...I hope this situation can be resolved quickly so I can maybe have a better opinion!< /Review>

Sorry, this is long over due......I hardly do Facebook , Twitter or any of this social media.  I still read my newspapers and glossy magazines.  I miss the dial up phone and the peace and quiet of the world.....all this technology is just too much .....

But anyways, back to the review....I like Avalon..... leasing office is great....always so helpful and lots of smiles and good coffee!!

Maintaince is great.  They will go beyond what's needed. Erick, Joe, and Renzo are the best.  They will help you with your maintenance needs...honestly.

I am not able to write a review  again......so I am updating this......love Avalon..   .they really understand your needs when you need a solution.   The trees at Avalon needed to be cut as the buds were falling on my balcony.  Christopher and Juan Franco was very helpful in pushing thus project ahead of time needed to be scheduled. Now I can finally enjoy my balcony without sweeping   over and over.!    Thanks Avalon!!!!!!</review>

It was a great start with the leasing experience.
However, once moved in, things started to go downhill.
The complex is dirty. They don’t upkeep the public areas. The corridors are filthy. They hardly ever pick up the trash in the elevator lobbies. The garage is filthy and there have been several robberies.
The move out experience was dreadful.
I was there for 1 short year and they confiscated my deposit and charged me ridiculous amounts for painting and cleaning. I never hung a picture on the wall! I never , in my renting experience, was charged for painting / cleaning.
I left the apartment in great condition.
Beware- they will take your deposit and force you to pay for painting and anything that is done to turn the apartment over to a new tenant.
I don’t recommend the Avalon at Woodland Hills.

<Review>Athenna is an amazing individual. From the moment she greeted me to my move in day. I’ve lived here since June. I am used to luxury living but the apartment she found for me suits me. Top floor with one of the best views. I have been to many properties but the impression Athenna made is by far the best. Her charisma, and the way she carries herself is impressive. Very caring but mostly a sincere individual. Such an assett to this company. Athenna thank you for the experience thus far. Keep smiling and continue to be yourself. You will go very far in life. Companies will be very happy with the way you work and represent them. Thank you Avalon for the experience</Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< Time>

I want to say the leasing office here at avalon Woodland Hills has really been so helpful. For instance, when I had an issue with my ticker for gate access, Athenna my favorite leasing office agent helped me. She really has helped me and I see her around the community being so nice to all the residents. Oh and I like her car. It's really beautiful lowkey :)</text>

I called to see about an apartment and Athenna gave me full details and answered all my questions- she sold the property to me on the phone and what made it better was when i was able to put a face to her name- let me tell you about her personality. Nothing but amazing all around.best experience i have had . The process went so fast and productivs. She knows how to sell but mostly her charachter you cant find too much of. Thank you Athenna<//Review>

<Text>I've recently moved in to the Avalon Woodland Hills and I am glad to say that its been a very refreshing experience. Athenna was my leasing contact and she has been a tremendous leasing agent. She made sure I got the apartment of my choice and walked through all the important stuff prior to move in. Her friendly nature only made the entire process even easier. Regarding the community, Avalon WH does sure seem very promising. The community is clean, frequent patrols by the security makes you feel secure, well maintained dog area, etc. So far I have had a very good experience with the move in and the first week, hope to have a good year of residence with Avalon WH.</Text><time>1516379581250</time>< userid>

< Review>
Daniel is a great person of contact, we moved from out of state and he was able to handle everything remotely without an issue. The complex is beautiful and is very pet friendly with a little fenced in area for dogs to run freely right on the side of the property. There is security patrolling the area, but I am concerned with the ease of non residents being able to access the facilities. There is a gate at the front of the complex but it remains open long enough for cars to tag along behind you. The pool and workout areas are accessed with a keyfob but I've seen other residents open the gate/doors for strangers who ask to get in. We've been here for about three weeks and I've seen the security guard several times throughout the day, which puts me at ease. It still makes me uneasy about these people potentially breaking into my mailbox, I wish those were more secure or had obvious security cameras.

But the complex is gorgeous and modern with nice utilities and a friendly staff.<//Review>

<text>Athenna Gets 5 Stars!!! She was Great, Lively, and Fun! I had such a Great Experience There meeting her, i felt like I Gained a New Friend! She is Awesome!! She gave me an Unforgettable informative and fun tour, where i laughed a whole lot and got Great information about the apts. The apts look nice, but the 3 stars are for their 3rd party approval company that they use along with their "Approvals," and so-called $150.00 move in "Special." My credit scores are Good! I Mean Good Enough To Get Approved for even more expensive apt complexes, loans etc! They pulled my credit, gave me a hard inquiry, and told me i need a cosigner or put down $1950 EXTRA!! Huh??!! No Way!!! That Sounded like a Scam To Me! I was Really confused and upset at first, but it just sounds like a game to me. Athenna is Great, but Avalons' "Approval" process is a Joke!

<Text>Security Deposit  - consider this a gift to Avalon Bay for the use of their facility. You will not be provided with a justifiable explanation for the confiscation of your security deposit.  I have no children and lived alone; there were no crazy red juice or wine stains left on the carpet and I even had a video in which I walked through the entire apartment. There were NO stains left within the carpet that a basic carpet shampooer could not remove. I only stayed in the unit for 7 months so it was not like I had worn the carpet down over time. Avalon Bay charged me $1000 for a full carpet replacement. Honestly it is not something I am angry over; it just saddens me that so many Corporate citizens have baked into their everyday business practices the act of gouging everyday citizens. I am actually in another one of their properties right now and you would think that would mean something to them. I feel awful that I have to pay a company like this rent for another 11 months when I know they could care less about me. Really crummy Avalon Bay. Very disappointed resident.  Also Avalon this is a rhetorical comment. I do not desire a response or pacification. I am simply informing fellow Californian residents of my experience with you. I do not need to be nor do I ever wish to speak to any representatives of your company again. I will pay my rent to you until I am able to free myself from you without a huge financial penalty.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>I want to shoutout and say thank you to Sandra for helping me out through the process of moving in. But I really want to give a big thank you to the awesome Athenna for showing me the beautiful loft when I was making inquiries. It was a furnished loft and it was the last one available to rent. I was really impressed with all of the designs in loft and really pleased with how Athenna showed me the loft.  Athenna gave me a follow-up Call to see if I was still interested and made the paper work process really smooth. She was really friendly and very interactive and I really liked that about her personality. Even after move-in When she saw me around the residence she would still ask how I am enjoying the new place and if everything is okay with the unit. I'm in love with this place. Great team here at avalon Woodland Hills.< /Text>< pictures>

I signed early 2018. My leasing agent was cordial and professional, Mr. Manny Montes, he made the contractual process very easy and I was very specific regarding which side/floor of the building I wanted my apartment located and he quickly found a suitable option which I agreed on; Athena who was not my primary leasing agent nonetheless she was also very respectful, accommodating and professional as well. First day I moved in my smoke detector was sounding off due to a low battery I walked down to the leasing office and was greeted by Sandra who assured me the service request would be resolved hopefully that same day but by the latest next day (it was already approaching late afternoon); sure enough Sandra got someone in 35 minutes, I was very impressed with the service she and her team executed... Sandra herself was very kind, caring and professional. In all, I have not had any issues and I'm enjoying my stay at the Avalon WH. I'm a prior home owner (market was high so I sold) and went back to renting so obviously I had my doubts about any rental lease I was going to sign as you always will find some kind of negative reviews on the internet, some truthful and some out of spite and revenge, mainly about unprofessionalism of staff, poor security, unclean/unsafe community Avalon WH had the least complaints if any so I trusted them as my new home, decent track record; lets face it renting is renting, owning is owning totally different worlds and experiences.</text>

The staff was fantastic and the experience of living there was great. But, when it came time to move out they took my deposit and charged me for a full remodel. Carpets could have been shampooed but I take responsibility for the fact that there was normal wear and tear tracking by the front door instead ob just doing that room they decided to redo all the carpet in the apt. Again I don't mind paying for what I did but I was charged 200 for reprinting the whole unit when for the year that we lived there I never hung anything on the walls or had furnature up against them. I challenged this and a day later they said sent me an email saying "after carful review we deem these charges valid". When asked for proof they send me pictures of the floors and stuff they needed to clean but none of the walls. When asked why convienently there was no pictures of the walls they told me that pictures were a curtecy and not necessarily. This is the thing I'm 3 years sober live pay check to pay check trying to restart my life. Just now have I got my credit pack to normal. So I have to options take them to small claims court and it would cost more money that I don't have or let it mess up my credit and my mothers who consigned. Avalon is a big company know knows that so why not send me a bill when they know that I don't have a choice but to pay. Ps Daniel is amazing again only problem I had with Avalon is the bill they stuck me with after move out other than that they are fantastic.<//text>

<time>1503989567525< /time><review>I lived for a year in here and from the get go it was bad, I'm a single mother two children, I when to sign the lease and paid the deposit every thing seem fine they where getting my money, they told me to come back to get the keys to move in in a week or so I did by then I have call every place to make the address change and have my stuff and kids with me, they told me we make a mistake we can't give you this apartment you have kids, which I stipulated from the beginning, the manager offer to find an apartment with in the area so I can move some where else, but I did not left I stood and for a whole year I recived constant complaints that I was too noisy even when I wasn't at the apartment, that my balcony was over saturated whit stuff which was emty, they complain about the poop of my dog and I don't have one, I have a washer and dryer inside the apartment, every time I used them they came to knock on my door that I was being noisy.
Finally the lease was almost up and they send me a rent increase for $400, so I turn down the new lease, I cleaned the apartment and have it ready for them one week before the lease was up they told me if you return your keys before the due date you have to pay $300, so I waited for the exact day printed on my lease which I have save just in case, they call me to let me know that I felt to follow the exact date to return the key and now I need it to pay $400, I was already out, so I told them I had the lease with me and the exact date as they indicated, they insisted for a $400 due so I said maybe we can settle this at court so the Judge can see the lease and how you have harras me for this whole year....
The person in charge said ok I will review the dates but if you have your lease with you we maight need a copy, I said I have it, she never call. me back again..
so do I recommend living here yea sure if you like this way of living.

In responce to Avalon management now, to the Avalon management I lived, doesn't sound as it has changed a great deal, in order to place a complain about any one in there has to go trough specific people that either don't care or whant to keep an image that is not real,  because of my review I got contact it by Avalon, where they confirmed I was I tenant there, I did not specified dates but they weren't happy I tell the truth, when I lived there I try solve the issues by talking to them and always it was as if I was talking to the wall, next day another fake complain of noise when most of the time my apartment was empty, because I was at work, it was annoying to arrive to complains  every day....

Why did I make a review now, because .... that is it just because...
the same reason  I got picked on then just because ... the only thing I did was to find a place to live and have children was enough for them to pick on me...
I do not want to cut a deal to remove my review it will stay, I did not sue then but I should have, and if there is any one else that is been on the same spot don't wait, they don't care about you, the money is  the only thing with value to them.<//review><response>{'time': 1503691920654, 'text': "Liliana, it sounds like you've had a difficult time with a lot of different issues to address; I'm very sorry to hear that.

<rate>1< /rate><text>The horrible place that I saw in my life. All the tenants call this complex LEAKY BUILDING. Because every time that the weather is raining you will see leaking  from the ceiling.  And when you call for service they come after two days and fix it  temporary and next time again leaking. The service is very poor.
We don't have any privacy they come to your apartment without any notice. Yesterday I was in the shower and they came to my apartment without any notice.
Different kind of bugs, spiders and scorpions are in home on the back hill you can find coyotes and snakes
Two times in a year somebody stole my stuff from the car.
Three times thieves stole my sons bike.
Several times I went to check mailbox and I saw nothing in and all the mailboxes was open.
Staffs are so impolite especially the manager Miss Melissa. she's very careless about tenant.
When somebody want to talk to manager she say always I'm busy and I can talk to you I will call back but she never called back anyone.
The first day that I was here to sign the lease they had nice smile and take care of us but after I signed they even know you who you are.
We sign lease and after finish my lease I will run away and never come back.< /text><username>Betty Rah<//username><Time>1488387329329<//Time><UserId.>103304854314247584700<//UserId.><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2993549284fa3:0xbb53ecc377cc0328< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Avalon WH is a good place to live if you work in the area.
What is good: Nice location with stores like Ralphs and Target within walking distance.Amenities like a dedicated dog park,a basic but clean gym and two nice pools + jacuzzis with barbecue areas.Management in the leasing office is responsive and helpful

The bad:Theft from mailboxes and tresspasing by homeless people is on the rise.Dog owners dont pick after their pets business.Coyotes roam the hills on the back of the property.Lighting is sketchy in corridors and common areas.

The ugly: Smell of weed is all pervasive throughout this property. Internal walkways and aisles have people smoking/vaping.Shady people in the east pool area during afternoons and the east exit gate.

Updated review 3/25/2017
I am updating the review since a lot has changed since I posted.We have since moved out but the move out experience was great.
Also there is now round the clock 24hr security that checks on all areas.Haphazard Parking in the internal streets has stopped because the parking agent asks you to move.Mailboxes have new locks and cameras.Smoking smell/weed smells have almost dissappeared maybe because of the cameras and screening for residents.The back of the property is now fenced off.
Much better property now than when we moved in.< /Review>

Daniel was great. He spent time with me working g out me issues, and rectified everything I had questions about and trouble with.
He was very personable, pleasant and patient.
Daniel was knowledgeable and got it all done effortlessly!
I intend to come back and ask for him again should I have any more issues. Thank you! Can’t recommend him more highly. You don’t want to lose this guy, so keep him happy. Best tech support I’ve ever had!

<Text>I had a complicated purchase updating 2 old iPhone 6s to SEs. Then while transferring our data, I decided to buy the iPhone 12s instead. Daniel Sandoval had the patience of a saint, and such a calm professional manner. He was so knowledgeable, and worked quickly while explaining everything clearly. I was in the store a long time, and Daniel could not have been more kind or considerate. Exemplary customer service is so rare these days…and greatly appreciated, especially in a busy store like yours. Thank you, Daniel, you made my day!< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I wanted to switch from Verizon to AT&T. My initial reasoning was because I am out in Carmel Valley most weekends with family and ever since a year and a half ago there are a ton of dead spots with Verizon that never used to be there before. Huge difference and the last 2 years every time I had to deal with Verizon it was a nightmare with rude reps and long wait times. I had enough. I walked in to AT&T last night and Jose helped me switch over and get a deal on my new phone. He was very patient and helped me with everything I needed, including getting me transferred from Verizon which was no easy feat.. Everyone I talked to was super nice, very personable, and answered all my questions and concerns. I even had some follow-up items this morning and Jose got back to me right away and resolved everything very quickly. Overall a great experience and I am so happy to be with AT&T now.<//Review><Response>None</Response></record>

I visited the Del Monte store today out of extreme frustration of trying to accomplish getting services over the phone. A kind gentleman, Eleis, received me with my ill manner and exercised so much patience. He patiently listened to me babel in circles, repeat myself and all the while stayed so patient and calm. He stayed late to resolve my issue and ultimately came up with the best and simple solution for my specific needs.
I appreciate him treating me with kindness when I didn’t deserve it!
Thank you, Eleis! Your patience and customer service  skills are going to take you far in life!< /Text>

<text>Dear manager,
I have to write this massage to you to praise your wonderful employee Daniel Sandoval.  B for his excellent service.
He is not only courteous, patient but also very talented. I made some mistakes in using the software of WeChat. It is very difficult and complicated to soft the problem. Daniel spent a long time and tried all kinds of means to solve the problem. I am very gratitude for his help.
He really should be recognized.
I am proud of your company has such a devoted employee.< /text>< Response>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>All of the reps in your store in Monterey are great.  Very efficient and helpful.  I returned after my initial visit and purchase because I needed clarification and education going forward.  My initial visit and purchase did not provide a clear understanding of what I was buying.  I was not 'knowledgable' enough to ask questions.  He did not get that I was clueless about what I was buying  and or how it worked.  Nor did he think to ask me. Hence my return. How could he have helped?  By telling me about the specific product in brief different from others.  Was this the best fit for me? I needed a new one.  I will get used to it.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Fonzi was a pleasure to do business with. He was personable, and we enjoyed a few laughs together regarding how indecisive I am with which products I wanted to buy. My wife is going to purchase a new phone sometime this week, and if I can coordinate it, I’ll make sure she goes in when he is working and asks for him.< /Review>

< Review>
I had a very positive experience at the Monterey ATT store for the 2nd time. It was not crowded. We were greeted right away and asked what we needed help with. Today Jose Fernandez greeted us and helped us with all our needs and questions patiently, efficiently and knew all answers. Thank you ATT and Jose for the best service! Also it was great to see hand sanitizers at every station and employees taking precautions seriously.</Review>

<Text>Jesse at the Monterey AT&T was awesome! He helped resolve my issues twice! His knowledge, along with his very friendly and helpful demeanor make him the go to guy I trust to find a quick and happy resolve. A 5 star rating is completely fitting to the caliber of service I encountered there.< /Text>< Pics>

TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I came in here with my mother to buy her an iPhone 12. The blonde lady politely told me that I have to wait, so she got my number. After 15 min of waiting outside in the cold, we decided to go to Macy’s and wait there. Another 15 min after and we get a call that it was our turn; and we were back at the store within less than 5 min. Some other guys greeted us this time. He told us that we were NOT on the list; and when I explained that we initially checked in a half hour ago and that we received a call from the store to come in, he rudely told us “I’m with a customer right now I told you I can’t help! Your only option is to check in and wait.” At this we just decided to leave because we weren’t ready to wait another half hour in the cold. On our way out the same guy ran up to us and asked for my last name; I simply told him “we’re leaving.” His response: “Fine by me.” Yes, that’s how we were treated on the Monday after Xmas.<//Text>

Rocky was my sales associate and was so awesome. I was there with my 4 year old and he handled my transaction with ease and finesse considering my kid wanting to run wild. His manager Dru also assisted and was very knowledgeable and incredibly helpful. These guys were great and helped me to find the right product and services for my needs that also fit my price point. Highly recommended< /Review>

AMAZING SERVICE!!! I went to the Apple Store and had an appointment already. But then I walked into AT&T and met Valentine. What a wonderful product specialist. He explained all my options thoroughly and showed me how I could save. I had my kind made up, but he helped open my eyes to some other possibilities. Now my whole family is ready to enjoy their new iPhone 11’s and their unlimited data plans!!!  Thank you Valentine.<//Review>

Paul walked us through a complicated trade-in and new phones purchase .  He was kind and patient and helpful.  Gabby took over for while and got our phones up and running with a smile - we think- she wore a mask!  Eli updated all our info on the phones and he knows all the ins and outs.  Paul sent us on our way and we so appreciate them all!<//Review>

Worst customer service! Got out on a waitlist with an hour and a half wait. Waited in the car literally staring at the phone. After 1.5 hours, went to check on the status. They lied and told us they called 3 times. Not even a single missed call (on an att phone). Told me I had to go back on the waitlist and wait another hour and a half. Called ATT and they couldn’t help the situation either. If this is the customer service ATT has, I’m switching to Verizon!!<//text>

<Review>I trated 2 phones since November 2019 supposed to get a credit for my devices yet I have not received any credit at all. Not to mention they quoted me a rate and I been paying almost $300 twice as much for what is written on paper from the person who assisted us. Its been month after month that I contact them and till now now solution has been done towards my account. They escalated the 2 months ago yet no answer from them. Do I recommend AT&T? Absolutely NO.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Luke met us immediately upon entering on this not-so-busy Thursday morning.  Even keel, knowledgable, and efficient, he made the iPhone upgrade seamless. Really appreciated his professionalism, and he was wearing a mask the whole time (as was all the other employees and customers) and used hand sanitizer regularly.  checked for upgrades, checked for better deals on plans, checked for accessories I might need. No up/overselling, but made all the extras/bells&whistles known.
Best store experience to date (though haven't really had a terrible one than I can remember).  Luke was awesome.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Gmap_id>0x808de42c932a983f:0x9aa84c3d234a2894</Gmap_id>< user_name>

Amazing experience at the ATT store today. My rep was Valentine and he was Excellent. He was very personable, professional, courteous and knowledgeable. He was patient and took his time in answering all my questions and explaining my options. His managers were also excellent and provided prompt assistance when we needed help with a complex plan change.
In general, I deeply appreciated that they looked out for mand in the process saved me quite a bit of money.
Great overall experience. Thanks everyone. Keep up the great work<//Text>

Adrian and Gerald both extremely helpful.
We’re aware of the data plan I needed to change auto pay on. Went smoothly. Checked on wireless account to make sure all was in order.
Excellent polite experience.</text>

My experience at the At&t store at the DelMonte Mall was Alan excellent experience and I always love coming into this store. They are always so organized, willing, and follow the law orders (i.e. COVID). And even if it makes others frustrated because they lack patience, the members, ESPECIALLY Jose-Luis Zamudio, a retails sales assistant. He was extremely kind and friendly, and helped me with all my questions. I highly recommend him for a raise! I didn't have to wait long at all and I could bring my dog into the store! Which I LOVE. I think this store is one of the best AT&T stores I’ve ever been too in my life.<//Text>

<Text>I walked into the Monterey AT&T store at Del Monte shopping center at my wit's end. Super Long story short, our AT&T bill had a $300+ charge for phones that we had already returned. We called the corporate office for months and they kept telling us it would be taken care of but never was.  We walked into the Monterey store and David C. listened to the whole issue, came up with a solution and worked with his manager to get it resolved. He was very professional and of explained everything in detail.  We walked out of that store with the whole issue completely resolved.  He did what the corporate office couldn't do over the course of months in less than an hour! He also went over our bill/packages and helped us get things in order for our (very soon) move. David C. is a life saver!  He definitely helped alleviate the stress we were going through.  Thank you!!!!</Text><Response>{'time': 1595362656368, 'text': 'Hello Nichole Flores We know that first impressions are very important.

<pictures>None< /pictures><Review>Valentine was professional and had educated insight as to how I could save money going forward.
I am now paying less on my monthly AT&T bill.
I also walked away with a new iPhone 11 Pro Max and a new tablet.
I’m excited about my new phone and by how much I saved by going into to the store.
A very good experience overall.</Review>< username>

My experience at the AT&T store in Monterey was excellent. Two representatives, Thomas and Andrew did a beautiful job helping me transfer an account to my name after my husband’s death and also to set me up with their  online service to transfer the internet account into my name, something which I found very hard with the representative who took care of me on the phone.  I now feel very happy with AT&T service which I did not after a call to the remote access people on the phone.< /review>

Long waiting time on Saturday evening. I walked through ant pass several associates with no concern about my visit. This is walk through place and some people passing it through. While I was waiting to check in another customer just left because no one here to help. I decided to wait so I do not have return next day. Associate show up after 40 minutes. It took 4 minutes to solve my question.
Not good experience with such waiting time.< /text>

I transferred my cellphone from Verizon to AT&T to take advantage of the half off iPhone 11 and get a iPad 7th gen for $150. I am very pleased with adrians superior service he has provided by transferring all my information to the new devices and got me signed into my email addresses. Highly recommend the AT&T store at the del monte center, thank you for everything!<//review><date>1591232589969</date><username>Carl Outzen</username><gmapID>0x808de42c932a983f:0x9aa84c3d234a2894<//gmapID>< resp>

<user>110961791431559358645</user>< Review>
I went in to do a transfer from my old broken phone to my new phone. Rocky helped me out and was so amazing. I was really nervous and scared about losing all my pictures of my son (on the verge of tears) and Rocky kept telling me it will be alright and we will figure it out. I was panicking and he helped me stay positive and calm. The only bad thing about my experience was Sal. He kept interrupting our session to make sure Rocky was doing his job and it was super weird. Sal also wore his mask below his nose then eventually below his mouth, but proceeded to chastise other employees for now being 6ft apart.

I worked with the ATT staff over two days. I told the manager, Dana about my experience with Sal and Dana was amazing. He made sure I got the help I needed. So in the course of two days I worked with
1. Rocky
2. Dana
3. Shania
4. Nicole
and
Sal.

Everyone was so helpful and great (except Sal) but don't let that stop you from coming to the del monte store. They really saved me. I didnt lose a single picture and I am so much happy. Thank you del monte store!</Review>

< Review>
I have never actually submitted one of these in the past, but my experience with the folks at this shop was do dreadful, infuriating, and demeaning that I was compelled to say something.

Upon, arriving I was initially told that I would need to get on a queue, despite the fact that they did not ask or let me finish stating my purpose at their location. Once my turn came, a brief 10 minutes later, I managed to explain my case to the assigned agent. Since my inquiry was about a damaged phone, they asked if I had insurance and promptly placed me in front of an ipad to file a claim online. While the process might seem intuitive, it is a bit limiting if you as hamstrung by the lack of a phone as you will need a phone number or access to email to complete the verification. This meant I had to hunt down a third agent, who stopped me half way through my explanation in order to "hook me up" with a phone to call customer support. This process only cycled back to the need for verification via a email or a text, which was yet again impossible as I did not have a functional device. This mean I had to hunt down a fourth agent, to ask about other options, to my delight he briskly responded that they are a "dealership" and as such do not bother with providing customer support and urged me to try again, then proceeded to focus on his mobile device and ignore me.

Such poor manners on behalf of all four agents who provided customer "service". I really is a pity that AT&T has shifted all support services to remote centers and that the provided support mechanism is an oroboros of frustration aided by nonchalant employees who simply can't be bothered. Glossy shop,  devoid of humans.</Review>

<text>This place is horrible. Sale representatives lie to your face. When I got my account account,  they promised me $300 gift card. 5 months later, guess what just $100. I went back to the store, and I had waited 45 minutes before a representative finally decided to "help me". Anyway, the representative called AT&T from my phone and of course I was on hold for another 40 minutes before I had to leave the store with no answer.
The representative refused to give me his manager name or number.
They would say anything to get you to sign a contract . Once you sign,  all the lies reveal.<//text>< pics>

<Review>Zero stars. This is personal. This company repeatedly has the worst customer service of any large, national institution. From long phone call waits, to transfers that require further long call waits, to being transferred to a department that insists for 30 minutes that I need to purchase an extended service plan instead of transferring me to where I can get help with DirecTV service which ATT also ruined, to overcharging me over $1000 when I combined my services, to insisting I didn’t pay my final bill when I finally had had enough with their poor service and actually have bank statements proving I paid, to trying to ruin my credit rating! Absolutely nothing good to be said about this company.</Review>< pictures>

We came into the store about a complication with our account that could not be handled online. Customer Service provided by Paul T. at the store was outstanding. The problem was taken care of and we were told we would receive a credit. Thank you.</Review>

<text>Every time I enter the AT&T store in Monterey I feel like the entire staff immediately wants to make sure my experience is pleasant and that I am taken care of. When you are dealing with a business like cell phone and data plans, sometimes you will have to wait a few minutes to get it all worked out. But the staff at this store will immediately greet you and help you with whatever you need in the most timely fashion possible. Best AT&T store I have ever had the pleasure of being in. A true testament to great service.< /text><username>spencer morris< /username>< Rating>

<Text>Best experience of any att store I have ever had. A friend bought a phone at  Best Buy  it wasn't working all the time and finally quit. The sales person determined that Best Buy cut the sim card to make it fit and that's why the phone didn't work. We were in and out in 10 minutes.< /Text>< Rating>

Weasel me to sign a cable deal by a sale pitch of $200 incentive then manager goes and say $300 saying we dont often give out it. I look online they have a $300 incentive. Thanks for ruining salesmans ship by trying to spice up my mind when it's all a fake exclusive thing. I'll be wary from all sales pitch like this thanks.<//Review>

<Review>I went to this store on a spur of the moment while in California. I got help with a overage problem on my hotspot. The guy was so helpful and was able to fix my problem. My only complaint is when I asked to use a restroom I was sent to the local Starbucks stores down from the AT&T store. Weird.</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
AT&T is advertising trade in your iPhone 5  by Oct 31st and get $200 credit for the 6.
Well that a big line of you know what. The rude sale person looks at my phone I have a slight scratch as big as a pin hole and he says we can only give you $60 because the company we work with is really stricked. As he is standing over the neon sign that says trade in your phone and get $200 I mean the phone is in perfect condition.
The sales gut was rude not helpful and the classic case of hiring someone that doesn't care.
I walked over to apple I was greeted and traded my phone in for $165.
I pay $120 a month for bad reception and now misleading advertisement.
Nick C was the only sales person that nice and helpful and Knowledgeable.
I guess version is the way to go. My friend walked into Version tonight handed them her phone and got top $$ on trade in.<//Review>

Carlo was a huge help as well as friendly and professional. I walked in with a broken galaxy s6 and walked out with a brand new galaxy s7. All I paid  was sales tax!! I would highly recommend this store because the staff is all friendly and knowledgeable.<//review>

Direct TV told me to go to a Att&T store to get a replacement tv remote control. I drove to Seaside Ca and that store had none on hand. ATT&T directed me to Monterey CA store. Guess that? We don't carry remotes. Thanks a lot<//text>

<Review>looked at Note 4. staff including Manager could not provide me with a stylus to demo the phone. They claimed they're ripped off all the time and the manager would have to open a new box so I could use the stylus. Wow, a definite 0 in customer service. AT&T Corp.  should find a solution so customers that want to purchase a phone, like the Note 4 can actually use the stylus.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Terrible!  Avoid purchasing a phone plan through this store!  They purposely left out details and lied.  Supposed to get a buy one-get one free.  Told it would take a few weeks for the deal to show up in billing, just enough time to not get out of the deal.  Stay away!< /Review>

<Text>The associates at this store are absolutely incompetent. I took an unlocked international dual sim card phone in once because it was getting a low-power internet signal. After an hour dealing with their stupid banter that I'm sure corporate HQ makes them engage people with, whatever they did made the phone lose all internet signal. I had to get on some online forums and within 10 minutes had fixed my phone myself. Pathetic that the tech people at the store didn't know what to do nor how to look it up. Long story short, avoid coming here if you can and search for the solution to your phone issue online.< /Text>< Pictures>

I called and made an appt for my daughter and I. They started her pedicure about 30 min before they started my nails,  she had to wait almost an hour until I was done. I was not happy with my nails they were all different shapes and they were not how I asked. They didn't even offer a discount. I wont be returning.<//Text>

Four of us went on a Sunday afternoon for pedicures. The staff was wonderful. We all got great pedis! This place is more than clean and COVID safe. You can see they have taken every safety precaution. We'll be back for sure!!<//Review>

<review>Had an appointment for 4:30, was greeted and picked out a color. Then sat for another half hour waiting for a nail tech. No one said anything about the wait. Watched 4 people be seated that walked in after me. Poor communication and service.<//review>< pics>

I've been going to Sky Nails for many years.  Trisha has been my nail Technician for the last few years now and I absolutely love her! Always does a fantabulous job! When she's not there I can go to Danny, Susan, Leo, and others and know that they will be just as good.  It is best that you make an appointment if you go during their busiest times and now with the addition of Andrew, he will do his best to fit you in.  But walk ins are welcome too and they always make every effort to get you in. Always a satisfied customer.  Thank you.< /Text>

<Review>I have been coming here for years. My favorite part is the people who work here. They are so friendly and personable I feel like I'm visiting a friend's house. They also do a very nice job with my manicures and pedicures. I typically get gel pedicures which will last me at least a month. And I get dip powder manicures which last almost as long as the pedicures! They have a large variety of colors to choose from and my nails look great for weeks.< /Review><GmapID>0x80ecc4c4fabae00d:0x50903c938e373e81< /GmapID>< Time>

<Review>They have done some great improvements.   Be was my pedicurist and Susan did my nails. Both were professional and fun. I will only go to Sky nails. They sterilize tools and are conscientious of cleanliness. I don't like it that I can't leave a tip if I use my card.</Review>< Pics>

Went in today for a pedicure and manicure with acrylics. The pedicure was great, but the manicure is awful. My nails look worse than cheap press ons and he didn't even touch my cuticles. I wanted to love this place, but I can't with these nails. I'm a student and I do better nails on my friends for practice and this is supposed to be professional.<//Text>

I was frequenting this salon for a good 2 years then discontinued due to funds. But I came back because the old staff was always so great and treated me so well.  I called to see if anyone was avaliable for a full set of acrylics and the gentleman on the phone had a great response and personality and made me laugh. I walked in and was seated right away . I told the guy doing my nails what I wanted and sadly it was not what I got. He was very addiment about leaving early and got up in the middle of my set twice to eat food. He didnt wear a mask and blew sighs into my face which reeked. He Didnt say much but the nails were crooked, very lumpy and a terrible shape. Not almond, more like points. He didnt ask me once if they were ok but I'm also not a person to cause problems, I just shut up and let him finish due to frustration. On top of it all before one of the senior staff came back they were cussing up a storm. F this, F that with a shop full of ladies. Very unprofessional. Im not one to complain and want nothing out of my review im just very dissapointed in my nails. Also very dirty salon. Sad, I really loved this place. Had to go to another salon on the verge of tears and ask them to fix my nails.
If he had just take the time and effort to be more accurate and cared about his work they would have been fine. I will not be back. Sorry. I gave two stars for selection and reception service.<//Text>

I had an appt at 11 for 2 manicures and didn’t get seated until 1145 and then the gal who did my nails rushed through the manicure in about 10 minutes and got very snippy and raised her voice when I told her the wrong polish number. I brought my mother for mother’s day and my moms nails didn’t get started until 12! We had plans after our nail appt and I’m very upset that I was treated poorly, had a rushed through manicure and had to wait so long. I understand you are a very busy establishment but for what I’m paying I expect better treatment and to take your time. Possibly don’t book so heavily so you have time for your clients. I’m very very disappointed and don’t think I’ll be returning.</text>

This was my first time getting my nails done, EVER. And the guy who did my nails was really rude and super short. They look nice enough, but they are definitely not exactly what I wanted. After he was done, he said to leave them in front of the fan(not telling me for how long) and then got up and walked away<//text>

I love these guys and have gotten to know them. As with most people,  be nice and friendly and the SkyNails group responds in kind.
Danny the owner runs a very good , clean salon with the newest pedicure chairs and equipment. They stock the newest colors in gels and polish. These are the best manicures and pedicures in town. The staff have always  been very kind and work hard to take good care of everyone. Wonderful acrylics, gels, mani'cures and pedicures.
The best times  to go are during the week and often in the daytime. Weekends are very busy and often booked  . Even though the spa is very busy they try to accommodate everyone.

If you want a great job on acrylic nails ask for Tommy. I've been going to him for a couple of years, he does a great job. Never had a nail lift or break!!!</Text>

Not a fan of getting pedis there, but at least they're very good natured about how ticklish my feet are!</Text>< pictures>

I had to leave in less than 5 minutes because the chemical fumes were so intense.  It's too bad because I hear they do a nice job on nails but I couldn't handle the environment</review>

I really cannot say enough good things about Paul and his team. I have been going here for 3 years now with 2 different cars and several big issues. Paul is honest, forthcoming, resourceful, and trustworthy. He looks to offer you multiple solutions when possible so you can choose what is right for you, your car, and your bank account. He will refer you back to the dealer or a specialist if he thinks they are better suited for a job because he wants your long term business and understand a that trust is a huge part of that. As an individual, Paul gives back to his community, lives a life of generosity, and wants to protect you. I never get mad about having to take my car in for a scheduled oil change or if the check engine light goes on because I love seeing Paul and know it will be an easy process working with this team. While I don't get to interact with the whole team often it is clear that these values go beyond just Paul. If this wasn't enough to convince you to give Mill Valley Auto a shot, they also text message updates and prompts for scheduled maintenance. You can communicate with Paul at any time on text! While that is simple, it's a huge help when you are stuck in meetings all day and can't call.<//review>

I went there on a whim after seeing five star rating from 74 reviews. I went there to get my oil change and got a free tire rotation as part of the service at no additional cost. Nice people. Have bith indoor and outdoor waiting areas so it was perfect for my dog and I to hang out.</review>

Delightful experience. Paul was knowledgeable, kind, and efficient. He communicated with me throughout the process of my car being worked on, and explained in detail all the services that would be done on my car. Prices were reasonable and fair. My car drives like a dream now! This will definitely be my one-stop shop every time I need work/maintenance done on my car!<//Text>

He's always taken care to differentiate between what should be done immediately and what can wait a little while longer and have always felt well taken care of. Sadly, we're leaving the area and can only hope to find a crew as amazing as everyone at Mill Valley Auto Service.

This team truly cares about you, and with everything they do they demonstrate their commitment to providing a quality, professional and excellent customer service. They fixed my car without any unnecessary up charge and provided me good advice on how to prevent a similar breakdown in the future. I couldn’t recommend them more. If you are wondering on whom to elect as your new mechanic, look no further - it is these guys.< /Review><user_name>Desislava Dancheva</user_name></record>

Always a positive experience at Mill Valley Auto. Paul, the owner, is honest and the whole team works hard to give you a positive experience. It is hard to find an auto mechanic you can trust but I have found one in Paul. I strongly recommend Mill Valley Auto. They do all my oil changes, brakes, etc and I have gotten new tires and car batteries there as well.<//Review>

<review>I rarely ever write a review. This car garage deserves one. I’ve brought both our cars (Audi Q7 and Land Cruiser)  here for a couple of years now. First it was for changing tires; then for other things including engine work. Every time the service has been EXCELLENT. The repair is always fair and prompt. It comes with advise and referral too.

<text>This is the best Auto Repair Shop I’ve ever found! These guys do fantastic work, and I above all, I trust them. I drive from an hour away to bring my car here. They’re incredibly respectful as well (if you are to them). They only do the work on my car that I’ve asked for, and if there is anything extra they want to do to it, they call and ask for my approval first. I’m on a tight budget, and they understand that, and only do what’s absolutely necessary for my car. These guys are great. I highly, highly recommend them.</text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x8085900804de31f7:0x2ca9fe456b128d47<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>I was given an excellent service here! I was out of town with my five children and my car broke down and they took me in right away and got me fixed up in an hour before they closed. The owner wanted to make sure I was taken care of before they close since he knew I was out of town. They even went to my car and jumped it for me so I could get it to their parking lot! They made sure they got the part in right away and took care of me! I can tell they're honest and have compassion! Thank you so much Mill Valley Auto Service!

I just had to replace my alternator again. The alternater was bad. Is there any way we can work this out? I know these things happen but it's a shame I have to pay twice.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I have a 2005 MINI that has seen only a dealer shop until few days ago, when Mill Valley Auto Service came highly recommended to me. What on earth took me so long to leave the dealer shop...? - Is my only regret. The car runs like new for the first time in years, and the staff treated me like a VIP. Came to pick up and drop off the car at the place of my work, were incredibly timely with diagnoses, went over the prognoses in detail, and gave me heads up on things needing attention in near future. Once the green light for work was on, my car was back in no time. Wow. Needless to say that the wallet was relieved to be rid of the dealer as well. Will recommend this place to everyone. Let's motor!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Jerry and Paul are some of the very friendliest people in the industry that I have ever had the privilege to meet.

Having just gotten a puncture flat late in the afternoon short distance away, I called MVAS to inquire about their service and availability, and Jerry said that he'd fit me in.

No surprise but the most pleasant of one when I rolled in. Jerry and Paul where there to welcome me and then they immediately went to work  patching the flat.

Thorough as well I must add. After re-installing the wheel with the patch repair, they checked the air pressure on the other three tires, the spare, and even re-installed the full sized spare to he undercarriage of my truck. All this in just under an hour!

I was able to get on with my work day as if nothing happened, and will gladly give them my truck repair and maintenance needs in the future!

Thank you!

<UserId.>104565901182968868756</UserId.><text>It's been a few months since my experience with Paul and Mill Valley Auto Service (MVAS). I'm sorry if anyone missed out because of the delay in my review!

My car broke down in Mill Valley. After leaving it overnight in a commuter lot, I nursed it the half-mile to MVAS on a Sunday and left it at their door. Throughout the next week I was in contact with Paul (and John), who worked hard to fix my car at a price that I could afford. Long story short, years of outdoor east coast life have rusted a lot of the underside of my car. The critical components are there, but as Paul made clear, "every time you have work done, there will be additional costs for materials and workarounds." I needed a lot of extra stuff, and he got it to me all at a discount. I'm pretty sure I only paid for the service and major components, but the front axle he managed to scrounge for me was free. I got the car back and I was pleased. Paul took the time to put my car on the lift and show me what he'd done. He reassured me that my car still had life left and was safe to drive.

Over the next week I noticed a noise coming from a front wheel well - I'm pretty convinced that this was caused by driving my broken car the half mile to MVAS. I brought it back (just in case) and after taking a test ride with one of Paul's employees, I had a bearing replaced. Turns out that wasn't the bad bearing; when I got the car back for the second time, it was still making the noise! They ended up replacing the other bearing for free, and did some work on my brakes as well for my trouble.

I had a fantastic experience with MVAS. It was a lot of back-and-forth, but in the end it was so worth it for the patient, honest, and fair service. When you take your car to MVAS, you will be treated like family. Everyone is friendly and helpful and will take the time to explain to you the condition of your car, the work that needs to be done, and the costs of that work. Paul, MVAS, thank you for everything you've done for me and my car.</text></record>

I don’t think I have ever enjoyed going to get my eyes checked before.  But at this LensCrafters I walked out having fully enjoyed myself!  First off, the staff was fantastic!  I needed help figuring out which eye care provider I had based on my health insurance.   Instead of saying “oh well”, Sammy was great! She helped me narrow it down and contacted a bunch of different eye insurance companies until she found mine. I really appreciate that.  We laughed and joked and had a great time chatting.  She was wonderful.  I was seen by Dr Andrea, and really really liked working with her.  She was very kind and I really enjoyed talking with her.   She was incredibly knowledgeable and explained things with a perfect balance of plain-spoken and medical sophistication.  I understood everything but never felt talked down to.
All in all. I will not only be back but will be bringing my family because of Sammy and Dr Andrea!  They MADE my visit and I really enjoyed my appointment!< /Review>

<text>This was my first eye exam and I was very unsure of what to expect. Katie went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and really go into detail about my coverage and what my options were for the actual exam and for my perception/ frames. My overall experience here was very pleasant and the staff is very friendly! Thank you Katie for your welcoming and bubbly attitude! Can’t wait to pick up my glasses and see crystal clear! Yay!<//text>< UserId.>

I walked in with a discontinued pair of my favorite Tory Burch sunglasses that I lost a screw to, and they graciously replaced the screws for free! And within minutes I was able to walk out sporting my glasses that I haven’t been able to wear for two years! Excellent service!!! Big thank you to Logan!!!</Review>

Katie helped us arrange for a lens replacement under our protection plan. She’s just the best! They’re definitely the no-headache alternative to other optometry places. Highly recommend the store in UTC. The staff are simply outstanding.< /Text>

<Text>Worked with several associates through-out the process and received excellent customer service. Was willing to pay slightly more based on the great service I received - to ensure my glasses would be a perfect fit (once the order comes in). Would highly recommend the UTC location... Keep up the great work!<//Text>< Pictures>

Team Lead Danny was very helpful, super knowledgeable and knew exactly what I needed and told me why, I didn't feel like I was talking to sales person but someone who was concerned with making sure I got what I needed based on my prescription. Would definitely recommend this place and will be coming to this location in the future!< /text>

<review>So I just had the best experience with customer service.  I went in to get new eye glasses. I knew I had insurance, but with the new year, I was not sure which insurance it was. I was waited on by Daniel. He was courteous, helpful and relentless in trying to figure out my insurance.  He finally figured it out, a gold star for him, and saved me a lot.  He was so nice that it compelled me to write this review...Thank you Daniel!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1614701354563, 'text': 'Hi! Thank you so much for your review.

Edwin did the small eye tests before I met with Dr. Russo and he also checked out my glasses for me when I was done. Edwin was SO accommodating throughout my whole visit. He was very personable and helpful as well! A big personality and a big heart. I was scared to go to Lens Crafters because of the reviews but Dr. Andrea Russo and Edwin were AWESOME.

Daniel was awesome as always.  I have severe Graves disease and have been through 8 surgeries in the past 19 months.  I have 2 more back-to-back surgeries scheduled on Monday 1/25/21.  My surgeon prescribed 2 new eye glasses for me to wear starting the day after the surgery.  Daniel took care of it at no charge because my prescription keeps changing every month.  Thank you Daniel.  You are the best.</review>

Service is a premium nowadays and this store has it down. I visited 2 other LC stores and there was always an issue with my insurance. I don’t know if it was experience or the fact that members were busy but no one took the time to look into the issue. I had come to terms that there must be nothing that could be done. Until SAMMI. She not only provided great help with frames and lenses but once she ran into the insurance issue she took the time to troubleshoot. SAMMI, found the issue, resolved it and provided some of the best service I have experienced in a long time. The entire store was great. Friendly, don’t make you feel like a bother for asking ?’s or being indecisive. Sammi, however, is a cut above.</text>

She went above and beyond to help me with all of my questions and concerns, and on top of that, she has EXQUISITE taste. I almost left with 4 different frames just because they looked so good on me because each pair of frames she suggested to me made me feel like a model, so bonus points there! She also let me know how much my insurance would cover for each pair and broke it down for me in a very simple way so I could understand. I had one of the best customer service experiences of my life here at Lenscrafters all thanks to Esme, so I know I will definitely be coming back and asking for her help for all of my questions!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Katie from UTC store was very helpful and efficient in processing my request to remove the one-year insurance fee which was inadvertently included in my bill. She also applied the $50 discount coupon when she processed my request. She completed the transaction without any glitch and she was very pleasant and courteous the whole time!!<//text>

Edwin my salesperson was super helpful and made my stressful broken glasses situation feel like not a big deal at all. He helped me pick frames and made me feel super welcome in the store. I would absolutely come back and ask for his help. Easily the best glasses buying experience I’ve ever had and I’ve had quite a few! Thanks Edwin!</Review>

Denise provided exceptional customer service. I came nearly blind and left with eagle vision.

I think Denise has found the cure for blindness. Her work is truly a miracle.

I didn’t even know what glasses that I needed, and everything she recommended made me look like a young Asian Brad Pitt.< /review>

We had appointments to have our eyes checked and when we arrived they were ready to receive us. The examination was very thorough and professional. I then picked out frames and within two hours I walked out with new glasses. My only slightly negative reaction is that I would like to have a wider selection of frames to include more unique frames like those that are available in Europe.</Review>

This was my first time in the Lens Crafters in La Jolla. I was blessed to be able to work with Edwin. He was not just knowledgeable about glasses and eye care but he was a kind individual. He worked so hard to get me the best deal that I was comfortable with. He helped me picked the right pair of glasses and lenses as well. I had been looking for awhile but his first choice where the ones I went with. I trust his expertise and I really cannot wait to work with him in the future. I will bring my family to the LaJolla Lens Crafters and will always highly recommend them!<//review>

I visited Lens Crafters today they had a lot of glasses of great brands I can say that it’s one stop shop. They also helped me tighten Oakley frame for free! :)< /text>

Really nice staff, fast service, great doctors! The team at UTC helped me pick glasses while processing my insurance even though I only knew the name of the provider. Everything was easy and efficient.< /Review>

Couldn’t believe we waited in line for 40min just to pick up contacts. Must have been next in line for 20min while we watched the Dr and employees standing at the register. Clearly no respect for their patients time. Will not return.< /text>

By far one of the most unprofessional and immature store associates I’ve seen.  Dismissive, would refuse to answer simple questions, giggling and whispering together like high schoolers, and eating and drinking on the sales floor in front of customers.  Truly disappointing and horrific behavior.

LensCrafters - you really need to cleanup and train the staff here and perhaps fire the ones who can’t do their jobs.</Text>

<review>I'm rather surprised at the negative reviews, but who knows.  I will say this; we had a minor disaster and these guys stood behind everything, made everything MORE than right. and bent over backwards to make sure everything was perfect.

So, I cannot speak of selection, or some less than perfect customer service interaction, but these guys stood behind their work and went the extra mile, and more.

We ordered new lens for my daughters ancient frames; the frames were 8 years old, but she loved them did not want to change.  Installing the lenses, they broke the frame because the plastic was very old; they really should have said "no" to the attempt, so the lab manager agreed to give us a free frame of comparable price, plus lenses to fit the new frame shape we pick out.

Daughter, crushed and hopeless, could not find a frame she liked, and could not really even see well enough to shop frames.  The manager put the new lenses in some temporary frame just so my daughter could shop, and then when we found frames that were much more expensive than the original, the manager agreed to just give them to us.  He then prepared new lenses on the spot to fit the new frames, AND ordered a pair of the more expensive lenses to fit the new frames.

I hope the long story makes sense, but bottom line; I recommend highly on the basis of protection and satisfaction with the end result.  There are downsides to going with a national chain, but there can be advantages too.

Thanks to "Mike" the manager that took great core of us.  1/11/2020 La Jolla UTC mall.</review><Resp>{'time': 1581347253395, 'text': 'Hi James! Thank you for your review.

< Review>
I would give this location no stars, that we're an option. I am very disappointed with this location as they told me multiple times my insurance was accepted, when it ultimately was not. The entire process was very uncomfortable, from the check in to my actual exam. The exam was rushed, and no one took time to explain how to use the equipment. I also noticed that the exam equipment had layers or makeup and grime from previous patients. It was clear the equipment was not frequently cleaned.
Later at the end of my appointment, I was told over and over my insurance is verifiable, but the store's internet was down and I had to wait for it to come back up. I ultimately was forced to pay out of pocket after waiting for an hour. This is shameful to lie to clients and run a business in this manner.</Review>

I have been going here annually for contacts and eyeglasses for many years.  Very convenient since the optometrists are available on weekends. I feel they are good listeners and knowledgeable.  Opticians do a good job with filling the prescriptions/going over lens options and frame selection is pretty good. I get what I need and have no desire to go elsewhere.<//Review>

< review>
I have been going to them for about 5 years, and have been going to eye doctors for over 20 years total (so some experience with trying different places). I knew this place was different because I was treated very well by the doctor, and the doctor made every effort to explain what he was seeing and what I should do to maintain my eye health. This continued for several years of seeing different doctors at this practice. I've seen both Dr. Shapiro and Dr. Kitamori several times and have really liked both of them, but every Doc I've seen there over the years has treated me well and given me excellent information.

At one point, I tried switching away from them because they're not very close to my house anymore, but it was a disaster. That doctor talked down to me and wouldn't explain what was going on with my chronically dry eyes other than reacting immediately to the fact that I hadn't walked in with sunglasses. I think she was so used to speaking with pediatric patients that I was unfortunately talked down to on that same level. Never again! I brought my business right back to this UTC office and have never looked back.

This office is also super easy to schedule with online, and they seem to innovate regularly, which is cool too.< /review>

<Text>The front desk lady was quite rude and not helpful at all. She didn't even let me know that this business was not in network with my insurance, and I used some word that was similar to "in network", and because it wasn't the correct term she acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. It was a small mistake and instead of politely educating me, she was quite arrogant, patronizing, and condescending.< /Text>< rate>

<text>I would give them 0 if I could. Eye exam was fine got my prescription quickly, but when I placed an order for contacts the woman who checked me out told me it would be about 10 business days but it usually arrives quicker than that. She then asked if I wanted them shipped to the store or my house and I said my house. Now 2 and a half weeks later I decided to call the store for an update and the tell me it's going to be 4-6 weeks and that they are getting deliver to the store not my house. Absolutely ridiculous after spending the amount of money that I did there. Don't come here if your looking for good customer service or reliable information.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>I go in for a new set of glass and needed a new eye exam, so far so good. The optometrist told me my prescription actually improved which is "common". I doubted it, but went along and got my new glasses. Fast forward to now, after wearing them for over 10 hours, stuff is still kind of blurry and when I mentioned this at pickup, I was told that they don't want to "overcorrect" which is the "sharpness" and I'll adjust after a week. I believe the poor guy believed that lie, fed to him by the optometrist.

Edit: a week later and there's an annoying fishbowl affect at long distances (had to take them off at the grocery store).< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1548341759426, 'text': 'Hi Joshua, thank you for your review.

Horrible service and failed to meet any  normal expectations. I just went in for a vision check and decided to order a pair of glasses. When the glasses came I could not see out of them, and returned that night only to find out they screwed up on my eye exam. I told them I did not want the glasses since I could not see out of them. A few scheduled visits canceled by the optometrists and I just want a refund, now they said they can't find the glasses and will not refund me?!?!? They lost the glasses, what? SAD... Ruby the GM was supposed to call me back, but never has! Finally got information from Ruby, whom I had to call repeatedly, and had to fill out my experience on website etc wasting more of my time. Finally refunded my money, after over 6 months for a pair of Oakley sunglasses.<//Text>

<Text>Overall, this was a positive experience for me. I only went to purchase glasses (had an eye exam elsewhere). The staff are very nice and help you right away, without following you around too much. They also do 1 hour glasses, meaning you come back after you shop around and your glasses are ready.

I had issues with my frames fitting my face and the lab technician was very nice and ran back and forth to the lab to fit the frames to my face multiple times.

They have very good service and do not try to push you to purchase more than you want. Also, their prices are not ridiculous. I only went here because my optometrist's office prices were much more than LensCrafters.< /Text>< Name>

Had an appointment with Dr. Shapiro. Explained everything in great detail and answered all my queries. The sales person was experienced and made great suggestions to me for an eye frame. One con was that prices are a tad expensive. If you don't have an eye insurance plan, then be ready to shell quite some amount of money. Not kidding.<//Text>

<Date>1524108286070< /Date><text>Very poor service. I went there with my husband to make a pair of powered sun glass for him. When we were placing the order they confirmed multiple times that they can give us the powered sun glass with blue gradient lens. They were charging huge to make the lens not tinted but making it by "digital cutting". They are the only place in whole San Diego area who said that this sun glass is possible to make. Other than the insurance coverage we had to pay hundred fifty dollars out of pocket. They were even charging extra to put the Rayban logo on the lens. We agreed to all these since they are the only shop who promised us the glass we wanted. But after two weeks when we got the sun glass, it was a black lens. The lens was very thick and heavy as told by other sun glass shops. All the money they asked from us with the big words were total nonsense. We denied to take it since it was not something we were promised. They returned our money back but took several days to return
the insurance money back, even after multiple calls. My husband could not make his sun glass yet because of their tantrum and false promises. DO NOT TRUST THEM.</text></record></dataset><record>

Felt rushed. Customer service was lackluster. Not a great selection of safety glasses and when I told them that the glasses all hurt they gave me an annoyed look.
In their defense they were a little busy... but every time I have been here they have been busy.</review>

They charged me $129.30 TWICE on my card for one pair of glasses I bought. I called them and they denied that they charged me twice and said my money must be in “LIMBO”. My bank account clearly stated “Lenscrafters” and next to it the money that went through TWICE. I called my bank and my bank said that LensCrafters DID have my money and filed a dispute. I honestly should sue for fraud. I even have the names of the people I talked to.<//text>

< review>
I spent close to 300 bucks on top of my insurance for my new frame and lenses but I didn't get what I want. My old frame, which was also from lenscrafters, was too tight for me. That's why I needed a new pair. I told them explicitly about my problem , but no one seems to care. I came back home, and the new frame was still super tight and uncomfortable. I had to come back again. The manager was very impatient and he didn't seem to be listening. Is this what i am supposed to get after spending so much? They are not helping at all.</review>

The incident happened on Sunday July 1st 2018 at around 6h00PM
My wife bought a prescription sunglass at Lenscrafter. It’s a Tiffany frame with prescription lens.
When we picked up the sunglass 2 weeks ago, the original sunglass lens of the Tiffany lens was delivered to us so we come back and check if they still have it. We need them because just in case in the future we want to use this Tiffany sunglass as normal sunglass without prescription.
HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED:
THE TECHNICIAN SAID THEY DIDN’T HAVE IT AND THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO
I ASKED HER POLITELY THAT I WANTED TO TALK TO THE MANAGER.
SHE CALLED THE MANAGER.
THE MANAGER IS ALSO A LADY. SHE CAME OVER AND YELL AT US THAT THEY CAN’T GIVE IT TO US BECAUSE WE DIDN’T ASK FOR IT.
WELL THE BEHAVIOUR WAS VERY RUDE. I ASKED FOR HER NAME BUT SHE DIDN’T TELL US HER NAMER. SHE ASKED US TO LEAVE THE STORE BECAUSE ITS WASTING HER TIME.
BOTTOM LINE IS WE WERE SPENDING MORE THAN 600 BUCKS FOR THIS EXPENSIVE SUNGLASS AND THIS IS HOW WE ARE GET TREATED.<//Text>

I have to thank everyone at your UTC location in La Jolla CA
Our 10 son suffers from extreme anxiety and panic attacks and have been much worse since his brain and spinal fusion surgery just a few months ago.
Everyone that worked with us/him was BEYOND AMAZING, they took their time and worked with him, calmly and with so much patience, I am in tears over how wonderful everyone was, we appreciate your staff and doctors even more after our visit.
Dr. B was so wonderful calming for him, I can't remember the name of the other two that helped us but once our son had claimed down they jumped right in and  got what was needed done. I also have to commend them on how they never made him feel bad or ashamed, our son walked out with a smile.
The whole time his little brother acted like a wild child.... I don't know how they did what they did, but I know I am going to sleep for a week.
Thank you so much, words can't describe how much I appreciate your staff.
Thank you</Review>

<rate>2< /rate><Review>The optometrists are good and I have not had any difficulties with the exams. The selection of glasses, etc. is fairly decent as well. However, the experience from the store front has been dreadful. Took me over a month to finally get my contacts (they were unwilling to refund me, even after they completely messed up the order and expected date of arrival). I had to drive several times to get trial lenses to hold me over. The way the office staff handles issues makes it very evident that the employees are not empowered to make decisions and lack basic customer service training. Previously had gone to Costco and look forward to going back for a more predictable and satisfactory experience.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
First time at this location. Loyal LensCrafters customer and never had a bad experience in the years we have been a customer. Came here for a routine eye exam. We needed a current prescription. Person who took the patient back to the room did not explained clearly that the dilation or optimap was part of the routine check up.  We clearly state we do not need additional services. Christina insisted that it's too late. It is never too late for patients to refuse their procedures. Her tone to a customer is unacceptable  and inappropriate. To treat a customer with rudeness, threats of security removal because I refused a treatment, and other behaviors I cannot state publicly are just unacceptable behavior. It's a good thing she does not work in healthcare. Patients or customers have the right and the option to refuse services if they chose not to approve elective services. The optometrist that examines clearly states the dilation or optimap is an elective or optional.
LensCrafters need to train appropriate communication on procedures to be completed on patients to ensure understanding of procedures. Please listen to your customers or patients so they treated, cared for, fairly listened to. To force an option on someone in a non life-threatening situation is unacceptable. This is a reportable event if they choose to dilate a patient who they did not have an H&P on. How do they know if the patient has an allergic or adverse reaction which may potentially lead to an adverse outcome? They never ask us to fill out an H&P prior to taking a patient back to exam room. Near miss as far as today's episode.< /Review>

Went in with my prescription ready to buy glasses then and there. No one offered to help me. There were multiple employees towards the back laughing and joking with each other, and one sitting at one of their little tables lazily texting. The most I got was a halfhearted smile from that guy when we made eye contact. Awful, awful customer service. I ended up leaving and will find somewhere else to spend my money.< /Text>

Repeatedly have failed to keep records of prescriptions for contacts after eye exams, thereby requiring multiple visits within a year. If you want quality and consistency, go elsewhere.< /review>

I tried calling them several times to schedule an appointment, and not only did they not answer, they did not even have a messaging system so that I could leave a message and be called back later. When they finally did answer the phone on the 6th time that I called, I asked if I could make an appointment; the woman speaking put me on hold, and then promptly hung up on me. Terrible service.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Rip off !!    Sold me $300 lenses in July last year. The lens coating has come off , a manufacturing defect . They refuse to change it a month late from an year only warranty !!! .... although they'd sell again a new set with a promise to last its life time .

Essentially their lenses would last at most an year !!!<//text>

<review>Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. I called to place an order and the lady I spoke with was extremely rude as if I’m inconveniencing her for spending money and placing an order. When I finally went to pick up the food I waited at the front desk for almost 10 minutes as I watched NUMEROUS waiters and waitresses look at me, see me standing there, and never coming to ask if I needed help. I then got frustrated from waiting so long to be helped so I walked up to the bar to try and get someone’s attention and was then ignored by an additional 5 employees that passed by several times while I am CLEARLY standing there waiting to be helped. There was a gentleman also standing near me and One of the Waitresses proceeded to ask HIM if he had been helped, looked over at me, and walked away. Never asking me if I’ve also been helped. I then had to tap a waitress on her shoulder to get her attention and she was ALSO extremely rude to me. I got a 10 piece boneless wings/ 10 piece traditional/ SMALL fry/ 1 side of ranch and 1 side of blue cheese. I spent a total of $42 which is the MOST I’ve ever spent on an order this small at a wing restaurant. The traditional wings were straight BONES…barley ANY meat at all. The flavors and heat levels they advertise on the menu are not at all accurate. Fries were cold and tasted like old cooking oil. My blue cheese dressing was like JELLO. Tasted soiled and disgusting. Please. Do yourself a favor and DONT EVER COME HERE please take your money elsewhere. Wing stop has WAY better quality wings for HALF the price. Just wing it is absolutely amazing and at least their price makes sense because their wings are full of meat and sauce. I was able to purchase 10 boneless/ 10 traditional/ a LARGE FRY/ 1 alcoholic drink/ and 2 large soft drinks for only $35. Seriously. This place sucks. I’m a customer bringing MY paying money and expecting to at least get what I paid for. Completely unacceptable. If you see a customer clearly waiting ASK if they need help. I shouldn’t have to go into a business and chase down an employee to help me. -0 stars if you ask me.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Will never be back to this location. Came to double date on a Friday night, was told the wait was 30 minutes. We waited in parking watching multiple people walk in stay for the food and left.. after more than an hour I went to see what the hold up was. Was told we were more than welcome to sit outside. Poor service, rude customers, security was ineffective, and at the end our food was put in to go containers because we complained about an incident that occurred. Left with a sour taste in our mouths. Very disappointed< /Review>

<text>Been coming here since they opened and haven't stopped since. Perfect place to grab some satisfying food, drink a cold one and catch a game. This has become my friend's and family's go to spot. We have seen djs there karaoke and a band at the Niles location. Always a good time. Thank you rock&wings for all you guys do. You guys truly rock!

The food and drinks are great, but their Karaoke nights are a MESS. Karaoke is nice but they put the volume up so high you can’t hear the person sitting next to you, we ended up sitting outside in the cold because we couldn’t even talk to each other.<//text>

This place really stands behind its name Rock & Wings 🤘🎸 Based on wings I have tryed around town, this place has one of the best👌 really tasty and big wings. The beer is super cold like its supposed to be. The service was good but pricing is a bit high compared to competitors. They do have weekday specials. The atmosphere is really cool and rock pictures and art is all over including a drum set on the sealing. They got enough seating for this size place and lots of parking. It also has a pool table in the back that is a little tight but manageable. They do have karaoke which is always fun 🎤. Overall this place is really cool and recommended.<//review>

<review>Signed my name on the waiting list with only 2 parties ahead .

Wife and I waited 40 minutes watching numerous parties leave and at least 8 parties arrived after us be seated . Spoke to the staff and was told there are still 2 parties ahead of me . After waiting over an hr we decided to leave noticing they are only seating bigger groups of 4 or more neglecting every couple I saw waiting as well - poor Customer Service .

Never did get a phone call that day to be seated we would have waited 3 hours until closing .</review>< Rate>

We were really impressed with this place. The theme is rock...classic rock, alternative rock, etc. The atmosphere was great, welcoming & really cool to look at all the rock related art on the walls, ceiling, tables & behind the bar. We ordered the Original wings & Lemon Pepper wings with Rockin Tots. The food was delicious & the wings are good size. Our waitress, Jazmin, was very attentive,  knew every kind of beer they carried by heart, and had great customer service. The beer is served in chilled, clear glass mugs that literally have ice on them...so incredibly refreshing & delicious!
I really enjoyed the rock music playing, the gigantic screen TV playing a sports channel & 2 other TV's showing rock concerts.
As much as I enjoyed the place, this is somewhere I would go with just the hubby & leave the kids at home, so we could re ally enjoy it but it's not a bad place to take kids. The waitresses arent dressed skimpy either, which makes taking the kids ok, but still present a good level of attractiveness (if that's what your looking for).
My only con, which did not reflect on my rating bc it was a small issue, was the room temp. It was cooler than outside but still kinda warm. I get hot when I have a beer so buy the time I was eating I was a tad sweaty. Overall, my hubby & I loved this place & will definitely return. We recommend trying Rock & Wings out. They do to-go orders also!< /Review>

Heard this was a good spot so decided to check it out. Went for the Niner game. They have a nice set up for games. Main reason I picked this place was for the happy hour lol. My mom had the rock burger and fries, which was cooked perfectly. Everything out table had was great. We tried their wings, tater tots, fried pork skins, tacos, chips &cheese && of course michieladas. No complaints on food or drinks. Everything was correct, came out at a decent time. My only problem was they could of definitely used extra staff. They got really busy and kind of lost their customer service but it happens. Overall still recommend for NFL games, happy hour and food<//Text>

I decided to give this place a second try and let me tell you they did not disappoint!  I got the teriyaki and pineapple habanero wings and they were delicious!!!  The waitress Rosie was so kind and attentive! I will be back! Definitely one of the best flavored wings I have tried in a long time! And the music is great!< /Text>

<Review>Wings? Well it's a wonder why people like Rock & Wings? It's my first time there and I ordered to go. No drinks just wings. Well 15 minutes later I got my wings and went home. Wow dry and very little seasoned.  I guess if I would of stayed there and ordered a couple drinks the wings might of tasted better.< /Review>< pictures>

That Mac and cheese tasted as good as it looked. And I never ordered Mac and cheese anywhere due to the way it looks 😅 but it looked really appealing. I wasn't just hungry either cause I had just ate pizza 2 hours prior 🤣🤫. Got to taste their mojito, was bigger than the ones I usually order elsewhere. Had a tamarindo Michelada and was very impressed. All in all struck As in multiple dishes and drinks. Great local business. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Five 🌟 for sure< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

< Review>
Walked in 3 workers at the counter no one acknowledged us (my first time here) they were too deep in conversation I guess. Seat our selves? Order at counter first? So we sit down grab our own menus. When she finally came took our drink order, brought our drinks asked if we were ready we said we need a little more time. Then she took too long because she started talking again. Water had a taste (not a good one). Was almost ready to walk out when she came finally. Boneless wings and fries were good but not good enough that I will go back. Bad service. Was not super busy and there was a big section of tables that were dirty but yet they were all behind the bar talking. Not impressed. Better luck to others.</Review>

Great environment especially if you love rock.
However if you spend on the touchtunes employees will skip over songs , has happened numerous times for me. So I wouldn't reccomend spending on the music. Food is good If you dine inside. Do not order to go, employees always get the order wrong & wings are always over cooked, & dried out. I gave this business multiple tries and due to bad service & bad food on the to go side, I will have to make it the last time I give my money to this establishment.
Please hire people who are able to take orders over the phone correctly & please explain to the cooks to stop over frying the wings! It's well worth the wait if my order is correct & cooked correctly!<//Review>

<Review>I purchased the Rocking Salad(?) and a tall Zeus. It doesn't come with meat so prepare yourself for a $2 premium to add chicken. The beer arrived filled and chilled. Moreover, the salad was great. My visit was during karaoke night; while quite entertaining at first, it quickly disrupted the relative comfort of the environment.</Review>< Pics>

One of the coolest wing spots in town. Love how they play live music and the place just looks cool on the inside. I've only had their wings and they are pretty good.</review>

I've only ever tried the wings, and they're really great. Seems they have some variety, though, so you should find something you like. The lemon pepper are a definite recommend. Place has a great vibe, as well. Think they get some live bands from time to time. Overall, service is great and if you're looking for a good spot to chill with the crew, I can't recommend this place enough. Will definitely be coming back</Review>

I was there for the first time this past Saturday and I loved, LOVED this place. Great service, great food & amazing music. We had the regular wings 1/2 buffalo sauce & 1/2 honey chipotle (both just perfect but I think the Chipotle was my favorite), a side salad & the Light My Fire Sandwich <-- You have to try this! I didn't think we could find steak "alambre" anywhere in Bakersfield but I'm glad we did. The meat was so tender and flavorful, they should make it in street tacos (if they don't already). As a plus, I love that they play both Spanish and English Rock and they literally have posters/pictures of my favorite Rock En Español bands. I think I've seen them all live. It made me feel sorry I didn't wear a band t-shirt to go eat there lol. Can't wait to go back!</text>

My girlfriend and I have been here many times, but never again.  Tonight is the second time that this establishment has come to our table with the same excuse.  "I'm sorry.  The system lost your ticket", after waiting 30 minutes for our order.  Apparently our waitress never put it through( as mentioned by another waitress after the fact).  I never thought that I would take time to write a bad review, but for it to be my girlfriends Birthday, made it be something more.  This place is shady and has no sense of organization. I will stray away from this place indefinetely.<//Text>

Customer service could have been way better. Orderd blue moon  it was off tasting concluded three others. They made us feel as we  lied . It was a  bitter experience. Seemed busy with only one server. I asked for a drink menus and the waiter or who ever he was said " we don't have one we have only been open for THREE months ".
They also had no toilet paper or paper towels in the bathroom.< /Review>

<review>I have eaten there 7 times in a row & am going back 2morro. I have had their wings, waffle fries, potato chips, reg fries & burgers. My favorite drink is the passion fruit lemonade.. It's all good. My fav is the lemon pepper wing, yum yum. The owners are so nice, along with the waitress.
It is a fun environment, along with clean bathrooms.  You all should come & give it a try. I guarantee you will not only come back, but you'll be telling all of your friends as I have.   Come eat & enjoy. Oh yeah on Mon & Wed it's 50 cent wing day.....Bee breezy :)</review>< Pics>

We tried the burgers and the wings, and they did not disappoint.   The burgers were thick but did not lose any juiciness.   The lemon pepper wings were a favorite.  The only reason I marked it down a star was because of the service. The staff was friendly but the wait to order as well as the wait to cash out was excessively long  .< /review>

<text>I was actually kinda disappointed this last time going. Alchohol was ridiculously over priced and was not even good. I do not paying for good drinks. But $15 for a gross drink is not ok. My Malibu and cranberry tasted as if they added sink water!</text>< Pictures>

Tried the man on fire which was the hottest on the menu after trying it out found out it was made with the scorpion pepper which is the hottest scoville in the world but surprisingly the taste was great too just super super spicy.< /review>< pictures>

This place was a huge disappointment. We went on the recommendation of a co-worker. It was decorated in an interesting way, but the music was so loud  we couldn't hear to order. Once we did place our order it took a long time to receive. Even our waitress was suprised we were still waiting. We got the food to go, and when we got home it was mostly inedible. 3 different flavors and they were all bad.  Bbq was tasteless, like no taste at all. Teriyaki tasted like they burned the wings and then just doused it in sauce. And the lemon pepper was so heavily seasoned it was like eating just pure seasoning. We spent over $20 and barely ate any of it.</Text>

<text>Unprofessional employees. One of the employees didn’t get my order even though I showed my receipt I order online. While I was waiting for my food he walks past me and said something in Spanish. And a female employee started laughing. So I wait til I get my food then I tell the guy if he had something to say then say it in English. He starts making excuses and back peddling about that his something was wrong in the back. But he waits til he walked past me to say something in Spanish? Coward. Food was about 6 outta 10 wont be going back< /text>< Pics>

Food was good, but got charged $2 for the ranch I asked for with my wings, and my childs drink when I ordered his meal - didn't know those items were additional charges maybe they should update the menu with that information .<//text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Without a doubt, Rock and Wings has become the favorite place of many since its food has captivated the palates of even the most demanding people; On the other hand, it is worth mentioning that the style of Rock and Wings has broken with the schemes and the boring monotony of Bakersfield since its family atmosphere is friendly, warm, and fun like no other place for this and for many other things declared to Rock and Wings my FAVORITE place !!!

Lovely place to hang out and meet new people.</Review>< pics>

<Text>How is this brewery not more well known?  This brewery is a must stop for beer and wine fans who live in the area, or are traveling to or from Tahoe. Their hazy IPAs are on par with any other brewer in the US. With a wide selection of other beer and wine on tap, as well as fantastic food and great service, Solid Ground is a must stop for a friday brew, or relaxing with friends. I wish their beers were more widely distributed. Thanks Solid Ground, for the great beers and times.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>What the....

Wine with beer? Who would think of such a thing together.

It works in it's own way. I enjoyed the sparkling wines.

Definitely recommend for groups that have different taste buds.</Review>< Pictures>

Very positive experience. Great selection and good food. I am definitely coming back. There is really good variety and creativity in the brews they serve. The food selection is limited but really good. Just got the meat n cheese platter but it was decently filling and good< /text>

The beer and fries were very good, BUT they do not care about whether people wear masks. I said something to one of their employees, and they said masks are not required in El Dorado County.  Really!  They have a sign on their front door stating that they are required! Solid Ground is very nice, I hope they don't get closed down because they can't follow the simple rule of having people wear masks!<//text>

< Review>
Decided to plan a last minute trip to Placerville. We had a couple hours to kill before checking in and decided to check out SG. We both absolutely loved their well balanced variety of beers. We each did flights and ended up with a growler of Cosmic to go. We also had sliders and fries and they were good as well. We had our three year old in tow and there were a bunch of other kids there too. Kid friendly. Highly recommend!< /Review>

Service excellent.
Beer good, though no amber.
Food okay, though fries were thin, burnt AND soggy. That takes skill.</Text>

<text>Great venue for some beer w/ indoor and outdoor seating and one of the tastier grilled cheese sandwiches I have had in a while.  The beer menu was wide and varied w/ a little something for most tastes.  My favorite option was the Christmas Ale, it was full of tasty winter spices and had a great mouth feel.  IN 2nd place was their Hefeweizen that had a nice fruity aroma and that great banana ish flavor at the end.  Good stuff.  We also got some food, both their slider options and the grilled cheese.  The Grilled cheese was quite good, the Sliders were flavorful and their fries were yummy.  It's a little out of the way I suppose, but worth a stop if heading in that direction.<//text><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

First time there so I'm not familiar with all the beer name but I had the Kabru IPA and loved it and a tropical hazy IPA which was really yummy. And then there's the food the dirty fries were bomb but the pulled pork burrito on another level can't wait to go back. Photos to come next time.<//review>

I was curious about the opening of this coffee, wine, and beer spot. Being as fixated as I am, I thought "meh, let me stop by and see what the fuss is about". I will give this place 5 starts because as any new place, there are things you won't know until you open your door to customers and wait for the feedback. Here are a few points, good and otherwise. First, I would welcome a greeting when people walk in, or perhaps a sign that reads "please seat yourself, if you require assistance please let a staff member know" I.e., handicap necessities and what not. Second, as I experienced, if it is custom to order from the bar, have a sign that states that so people are not waiting at their table or standing, waiting to order. The food was delicious and the beer/coffee?...amazing! Just a few suggestions, I hope it helps.

Now my second time at this brewery and they still haven't made the signs any clearer which should  state that you should order at the bar. I would highly recommend something more visible because people seems to walk right by the sign outside and the sign at the bar is tiny and I only noticed because I happened to be staring at the lights. The amount of food you receive isn't that great, I would recommend a bit bigger portion sizes for the price.< /Text>

<Text>Totally loved this place! Beer and food was good, and the service was great! IBW were playing and the place was packed, indoors and outside area. They can handle a large crowd.  We tried the spinach salad topped with fresh peaches and the fries, both were so good. It is children and dog friendly.</Text><Date>1535987648985</Date><rating>5< /rating>< Name>

Day 1 for the public at Solid Ground.  Staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  Casey, one of the owners, is working the crowd, giving tours of the brew room and talking beer with the patrons.  And finally, the beer..  fantastic!  Light to dark, excellent through out the range.  Get a flight and find your favorite.  Cheers!!< /text>

Nice large brewery. Plenty of space for meeting up with big groups. Great variety of seating options. Dogs are welcome on the patio on leashes. Food menu could have been larger with a little more variety. There was nothing that really looked great to us so we just grabbed a beer, which was definitely of great quality! Worth checking out!< /text>

Really nice brew pub- exceptional beers, can also be found at local restaurants.  The place has a very comfortable and friendly  atmosphere- very simple decor with clean lines. Regular live music, though  hard to find the schedule. Outside seating is available. Food is well prepared, just wish they had a larger menu.
This is a real gem for the local area and a great stop off point for visitors.<//Review>

OMG! Their beer is amazing! It is simple, you take grain add hops a lot of water and some yeast. So many breweries fail to get it right. Solid Ground is spot on in creating these liquid masterpieces of flavor. Their tap room is awesome! Very modern for a brewery and the food is really top notch and very consistent.< /Text>

< Review>
Came with my family for a lunch. I personally didn't have any drinks, but the food was okay. The fries were a little too salty, but otherwise could have been the best fries ever. I had puttanesca, but there was too much oil when I got half-way through it. The environment was clean and really interesting. The server was nice, but I didn't like tipping before I even had an experience or food. I like when I know I gave a good tip for a good person and good time.< /Review>

<Text>This is a really cool place. The only reason I didn't give it higher marks is their delicious bacon and avocado sandwich, the bacon was practically raw. I had to spit out the chewy mess all the way through. But they're homemade cherry cola was a great surprise and delight. They don't have Fountain drinks of sodas, but I'm sure their beers are wonderful. But I don't know. I wish them well, they are a wonderful addition to Diamond Springs!</Text>< Name>

Slightly noisy. Good service at bar. Beers are all appropriate for their style. Unusual ones including berries or wine grapes are very interesting. Sushi night, looked very good, they ran out,so popular. Polenta tots a good appetizer. Heard the chicken dish was well made.<//text>

The best thing to come to Diamond Springs in a while. A really comfortable and delicious local gem! The acoustics can be loud and overwhelming on a busy night, but they're working on it. The beer and wine selection is fantastic, as they say boldly in their bio, the co-owners have experience and truly know what they are doing. I'm so grateful to have a local place that shows talent in brewing more than just IPA's, they have created incredible lagers, ales, sours, stouts and more. Chef Shane will blow you away with his culinary creations (say yes to ghost pepper cheese). Portions are smaller for the prices, though still delicious.<//Review>

Great brewery. Staff is courteous and knowledgeable. Beers are great. Killer selection. Some crazy beers too. My wife loves that they serve wine too as she does not drink beer. Food is delicious. Love the Sunday brunch. Can't go wrong here. These guys know what they are doing.< /text>

<review>Overall great place and BEST BREWERY IN AREA BY FAR, from the staff and decor to the food and even their taste in the bands they book, all 10 out of 10.  Oh and the beer too.. it's on par with  the rest ;) 10 for 10!  (also a good selection of white and red wines on tap) First timers and regulars all leave happy with big smiles. Always lively with people but not too busy or crowded. Great outside area with cornhole, friendly for dogs, kids and the whole family.
Top choice of food, B.L.A.T., Sliders or Salmon Bahn Mi.
Beer Choice, any Hazy brew, any barrel aged sours and the "Pingo" sparkling Chardonnay is too good.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1552511261951, 'text': 'Thanks for the awesome review! Much appreciated.'}<//resp><Gmap_id>0x809a59f212c0f2a3:0x149d77fdd2e0eeb8</Gmap_id></record>

Food was perfect, of course the wine and brew were right on!  All ages from babies to seniors.  Felt like everyone knew each other.  Great place to go and can't wait till warmer season although that really didn't make a difference.  This place is a MUST GO!</Review>< Response>

<review>Quality over quantity! Small selection of great food *edit* their menu has expanded quite a bit for a small brewpub, everything is still amazing, have not had a dish I didn’t love. Beer and wines available for tasting and not just your standard pale ale/ipa selections either, everything from sours to a ghost pepper infused pilsner when I was there and always rotating new exciting selections. Great wines as well. Staff was knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly.</review>< pictures>

<text>Stumbled on in on Friday after having a doozy next door at Allez.  To my surprise, the customer traffic was outstanding.  It made the drinking experience more memorable than it probably was.  Service was great.  The bartenders are there to help, they were friendly, and were the best part about my visit.
The beer was not terrible by any means, but I wouldn't drink it regularly.  I grew up on Saison's, and I don't think the offerings at Solid Ground were any better than average.  In my opinion, the downfall was somewhere in the yeast.  The IPA's were ok.  The Trango is on the Milkshake IPA side and it was loaded with fruit, not much hops.  Again, not my preference.  The Clouds Rest tasted like a West Coast NE IPA if that makes sense to beer snobs.  It was good at first, but the appeal was lost after about 6 oz.
Overall, very happy I was able to check this brewery off the list.  They have great ambition, a wide range of styles, and don't compromise with providing a beautiful location to grab a decent beer.< /text>< rate>

Food is great...selection of beer is awesome...family friendly
My only knock would be-when crowded some customers are indecisive about what they want and can make the lines build
5 star beers selection, service and food tho<//Review>

Showed up 15 minutes prior to closing.

There were two people at the bar already being ignored by the lady behind the counter for about five minutes.

They wanted to order two more beers.

Cashier/Bartender gave them a hard time for wanting two beers prior to closing.

After she served the two in front of me, she looked to me and asked how she could help me.

I asked if the kitchen was still open.

Was told it was closed.

I worked restaurant and in bars for 10 years.

When you’re open.

You’re open.

When you’re closed you’re closed.

You lost a local customer for life tonight.

Notice: this was posted during operational hours.</review>

<review>They should STOP. Calling this a Park. It's a Sports Complex now. They took out every single Tree that was at the park. All u can see is the goal post fences dividing all the fields. It's not a Park anymore sorry. Your lucky I'm giving u 2 stars.< /review>< user_id>

Please do not go to this park guarantee you get harassed from the employees they say that they work for the city. They tell you that you can only stay there one hour if they don't he will kick you out from  the park or call the cops on you.   I thought this supposed to be a public park  there is no limit how long you can stay.<//review>

We went there to watch the fireworks and it was a pretty wide park. It was July 4th when we went there and we felt safe that day because cops are everywhere. I'm not sure if its safe on regular days tho but my husband said his family always visit this park every 4th of July. My husband and I had fun watching fireworks.< /Text>

Wish they had Better Lighting. This is an easy place for drugged up people to Hang out & Child molesters to hide. On Top Of it All The Portable restrooms are DEGRADING to the City of La Puente, Children & Families who Visit this Big  "potentially Beautiful Park"
With the $10x hr. For the party Kiosk they should Make Improvements to the City Park... Shame on City officials who Don't care enough about our City Park.</Text>

I have been coming here for so many years now, and I have never had or witnessed a problem here. And you need to remember that this park can get very crowded, and on the hottest days of August in LA, people can easily lose control. The place has in and outdoor activities, organized and well maintained.< /review>

<Text>I think this is a great park with a community center on site. There are hand ball courts, basketball courts, and tennis courts. They have many Pee-wee divisions as well as cater to different age ranges. It's a great place to go spend some time.</Text></record>
