<text>Close enough where we can walk, because parking anywhere in Hollywood is insane! The prices were relatively fair, especially for being in Hollywood. The meat was good. I’ve definitely had better Kbbq in K-town but this is a good quick fix place. Sesame oil provided on the table tasted watered down. The sides are good, so happy they have rice noodle paper provided with their sides! Their sesame salad is actually really good, tasty dressing. Service was good, it wasn’t busy, they continuously check on you, super nice people.</text>< name>

I did not like this place, the second time I will not go back! a portion of meat is small, with an overestimate price. Expect more from this place ... At first it was nice, fun, but then I noticed the hood, it was very dirty. The hood is directly above the table .In the end I put 2 stars, for dirt and a high price. I do not understand why they put high scores in this place ???!!!<//Text>

This place requires a better leadership it has potential but they need to start to learn how to cook rice.
the price is acceptable , the quality of the meat specifically the chicken is not okay, the time between refilling the meat needs to be improved it is not okay to wait so long to get more food. I hope this  review doesn't hurt in any way the business but instead helps to improve.
I look forward to give this restaurant one  more chance<//text>

Cheap and (fairly) cheerful. Reasonably priced and one of the few spots that serves wine. Not in the same league as the KBBQ restaurants in K-town.</Review>

This place is amazing. The food is so good. Its all that needs to be said...and if some Texan gave it 1 star well...they should go back to Texas cos I bet nothing outside of Texas meets their Texan "standard" plus anyone who is a BBQ fan knows that each part of the country has its own take...this is a delicious, local, AA establishment where the food is made with love and on Sunday.. a soundtrack of gospel and soul.</Review>

This place is amazing! I love korean bbq as it is, but was pleasantly surprised by the vegetarian options offered here. I'm not actually a vegetarian but I ended up sitting with the vegetarians in our group and I can honestly say I enjoyed all of the food that was served. I'm sure the meat is delicious too, considering the flavor of the vegetarian meat. Give this place a shot if you are nearby. Also try the strawberry soju wine stuff... it tastes like candy but its strong ;)<//Text>

<Text>This was so authentic and delicious! From the korean music videos ambience to the way the food was served. As a Korean American living in sf, the authentic korean food options are def limited, this really made my day! Tim was especially nice and nomi was great with suggestions. I'll def be back!< /Text>< userid>

Used UberEats to order and for $8 per big bowl of spicy pork, it's a steal.  Food arrived in 20 minutes still fresh and warm.  Delicious and can order optional banchan.  I got mine with kimchi fried rice but you can choose brown rice, egg fried rice, white rice or greens.</text>

< Review>
I was a little worried at first.  We couldn't find parking and it looked closed.  But we made it!
Fast service,  friendly staff,  and the food is the best K BBQ I've had yet!
Adding to my review...
After a second visit,  I like this place even more! It's a different experience.  It's family owned.  Not by a bunch of quiet Koreans,  but a fun Chicano/Latino family.  The decor is artsy,  the music 80's. The menu is set up a little different and after reading these cry baby reviews,  I can answer their complaints.
The least expensive plate is $12.99 and it's all you can eat. The meat flavors are limited on that meal,  but its all you can eat.
We ordered the $18.99 plate. It came with everything you get at those loud Asian run places.  We shared everything.  And it was all you can eat.  It taste just as good,  if not better,  than any Korean run restaurant.

People are just not used to seeing Chicanos serving K food.  Get over it! Enjoy!< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Straight up my favorite kbbq! This place is a great compromise for my boyfriend and me because I'm vegan and he wants Korean barbecue all the time. There's only two vegan meats but that is a lot more than I can ask for! I thoroughly enjoyed the chickenless chicken because it barbecued well. The marinated veggies were very good and I loved the side dishes! $20 for the vegan barbecue is pretty good to me because vegan meats are usually pretty pricey. Overall, I enjoyed my visit and my boyfriend enjoyed the regular meats.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

All the sides are delicious too, it's a great price for the quality and the fact that it's all you can eat. Love the interior too, it's fun and different!<//Review>< userid>

<Review>Great AYCE Korean BBQ. Although AYCE options are limited, it was a perfect mix of meats.  The meat grill didn't cook evenly, so you definitely need patience while cooking your meat.  Also, any meat that is not eaten if over in excess will be charged at the end of the meal.  Make sure you dont tale more than you can handle. :-)< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Squandered opportunity. Being one of the only kbbq places in Hollywood there is no reason why this place should not have a 2 hour wait on a Saturday night. It all starts with the menu. The cheapest ayce option comes with 2 meats, why even bother putting that on the menu. The banchan selection is very small maybe 4-5 items rice being one of the options. Salad only comes with more expensive ayce options. Next is the sauces. There is some oil and some kind of spicy mayo type sauce on the table, but really doesn't serve the right purpose. Service is also a little slow. Meat wasn't the greatest but not the worst.

I had high hopes, but unfortunately those hopes were shattered.< /text>

The spicy chicken is dank! The service is great, and a good selection of drinks. Plus you can't beat all you can eat for the about the price of a McDump combo meal.</text>

Extremely average. Very limited menu, even at the upper level premium menu. My date found dried flecks of food in her supposed new napkin. Slow service even though there were few tables occupied, and heavy sauces to cover up the cheap meat. Wouldn't return.</text>

The flavor of the meats in this place is very good! It's KBBQ style place, but fusion style. Very nice staff and excellent ventilation. You don't walk out smelling like a bbq yourself.  Pricing is also quite reasonable,  starting at $12.99. Great place for bbq meat without the crowds and smoke of ktown kbbq places.<//Review>

The restaraunt is owned by one awful manager named GEORGE who doesnt know the slightest clue when it comes to running a kkbq. Not to mention he treats the employees like crap for the majority of the time. Plenty of better and cheaper koreanbbq places to eat. If not Tommy's is next door.<//Review>

It’s been 3 months and everyone still brings up how great our host was, and how much they didn’t want the wedding to end. I want to say a big thank you from both our parents, and from the husband and I!< /Review>< Pics>

Andrey hosted our wedding and I’m so grateful that we hired him! To this day, all of our guests keep telling us how our wedding was the funnest wedding they have been to and how entertaining Andrey was. He will work with you to determine what you want included in the program, so it’s all totally customizable! I really loved how easy and flexible Andrey was with everything. My schedule was jam packed before the wedding and he made it all work around my last minute updates. Hire Andrey, and you and your guests won’t regret it!

We loved having Andrey at our wedding and love seeing him at weddings - always a lot of energy and professionalism.< /review>

Andrey did a very good job hosting our wedding. To be honest I don't know how it could have gone any smoother. Truly was exactly what we wanted it to be. Andrey hosted in a way that was a perfect balance of keeping our guest entertained without taking away from our spotlight. He was very interactive with our guests and kept them engaged. We did have a few things go off script in our wedding (surprise videographer) that shifted our wedding plans timeline that Andrey adapted and worked with very well. Overall 10/10 Andrey thank you once again, we really enjoyed you hosting our event<//Text>

Brought in an amazing vibe! Everyone instantly got ready to laugh and have fun after the ceremony. His DJ was amazing and played everything right on time. If you choose to hire him you’ll have family members asking you where you found him and wanting more info from him! He’s a total game changer, highly recommend!<//review>

While looking for a host and band for our wedding of 430 people, we were worried about the hosts ability to keep the crowd engaged. After booking Andrey and our initial phone call we immediately felt so much more confident about our reception! He spent so much time and effort talking and getting to know us to make sure our wedding program was exactly what we need and want, down to every little detail! We had to work around 108° record breaking heat, and Andrey was there ready to make any adjustments and help in any way he was able! He was still able to keep his energy overflowing regardless of the fact of 3 weddings and the crazy heat that weekend! His English and Russian fluency kept almost every age of guests engaged, we were truly amazed! We had a long and extensive program but due to the heat we decided to cut some parts and Andrey was on top of it, he made it flow and seem natural nonetheless. Also the jazzers were AMAZING! People were raving about them! They played so well and made the atmosphere so dreamy and romantic!! They also had to work around the intense heat along with DJ essence! Which made the event so much fun! They all worked together to create a beautiful atmosphere!! We were able to feel all the blessings and the presence of God that night and this team truly embraced it. After the event we had so many friends and family so content, if your thinking about a host we 100% recommend!!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x809adf611f0428af:0x16b87733dc0f4c1< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It definitely wouldn’t have been as exciting. Planning the reception with him was super easy and he took care of every detail. Everything went so smoothly day of. He does super well on the spot and is great at entertaining the guests. I love how well coordinated him and his DJ are as well. They make a great team. They were able to create so many funny moments just with sound effects alone. Everyone said they had an amazing time and I think they all loved that it didn’t go on for more than 3 hours. It was the perfect amount of time. We had so much fun. I couldn’t stop smiling and by the end of the day my cheeks were hurting! So thank you so so much!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>Wasn't a part of the bridal party, but attended a wedding in Florida and Andrey was the host. Awesome experience. He's funny, engages everyone, and just elevates the atmosphere so much! My Slavic parents (somewhat conservative, I would say) enjoyed their time as well, which says a lot. :) Funnest wedding I've been to!< /review>< pics>

<review>Andrey hosted our wedding with DJ Essence and they did such a good job!!! Everyone had a good time, and so many guests came up to me and my husband after, and said it was the best wedding they have been at!!! Andrey customized the event to match with our vision of what we wanted and was very responsive and always so positive. He made sure that everyone had fun, even non Russian speakers loved it since he did his best to speak both languages. He made sure to get our friends moving and the games were hilarious. It was awesome how the DJ played sound effects to literally everything that was happening. This what weddings are suppose to be like, we dreamed of a wedding like this, and The Andrey’s events made it happen❤️ Thank you very much!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x809adf611f0428af:0x16b87733dc0f4c1< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

ANDREY IS THE BEST!! We had a half Russian half American wedding and we knew we needed Andrey there before we ever met him in person! We booked him and right away felt soo much better! We knew it would be a great time for everyone at the wedding! We didn’t have to worry about the reception part at all- he has it all covered. Fast forward COVID hit and we had to move things around and reschedule everything and Andrey was so patient and understanding, rescheduling multiple times and his communication was great throughout the process! The day finally came and we had him do our ceremony and reception and he and his DJ exceeded all of our expectations! We knew it’d be amazing but it was beyond amazing! it was perfect! He made the ceremony part magical! And during the reception everyone was having a good time! Usually after the wedding guests talk about food- but in our case everyone was talking about how great Andrey was and how fun he made it!! You will not regret hiring him! Thanks for making our celebration unforgettable!<//review>

Our wedding was so long ago , but I still remember many facetimes and meet ups just to talk over the wedding and what we wanted our wedding program to be like. Andrey made sure to ask what our audience was going to be like and if we wanted him to speak in Russian or in English . He also gave us game options which I think is so awesome since a lot of the times the couple has no idea what their wedding program will be like and if they will even want that game played . Overall , our wedding was such a blast and flew by so quick . It’s been over 5 years now and we still get asked about Andrey all the time.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x809adf611f0428af:0x16b87733dc0f4c1<//gmapID></record>

Andrey hosted my cousins wedding in September 2020, and it was the best experience I’ve ever had as a guest. He was very fun, enthusiastic, talented, and funny. Everyone including my parents enjoyed the wedding that he hosted. I hope I attend another wedding that he hosts!</Text>

I attended two weddings that Andrey hosted and I dreamed of booking him for mine way before I was engaged. I am so glad that even through cancellation of my initial wedding date due to a family death, Andrey was available and worked with our schedule and new dates for the wedding, not to mention this was peak covid days, a very stressful time.
It is not an exaggeration when couples and guests say that the wedding Andrey hosts is the best wedding they have ever been to, it is a fact! And I can say the same for mine! Andrey is the boss at what he does and truly a great person to interact with. Andrey will listen to your expectations and exceed them. Consider yourself lucky if he hosts your wedding!
Thank you Andrey for being so passionate about every wedding/event you host; and making Slavic (and not only) weddings fun and entertaining! 😅< /review>

Oh where to begin….
Everyone dreams of that blessed, perfect fairytale wedding with the perfect atmosphere of love and unity… where the bride and groom are madly in love, the parents of the couple couldn’t be happier for them,  and all the guests celebrating love in a relaxed, entertaining environment with the most beautiful live music with perfect sound…to the point where everyone is having such a great time that they don’t wanna leave!!!
That is exactly what we prayed about for our daughter’s and amazing son in law’s wedding!!!
After seeing Andrey’s incredible talent of bringing everyone together and bringing joy and laughter to many of our relatives’s weddings… we knew we couldn’t accomplish this without Andrey, the AMAZING Jazzers band and the incredible DJ Essence!!! What a POWER TEAM!!!   From the very first phone call our daughter had with him… we could easily see how inspiring and thoughtful Andrey was!!! So determined to make the wedding all about how you envisioned it and willing to do everything to make sure wedding dreams come true!!! He put so much thought and effort to help our kids create the perfect wedding program that would accommodate everything and everyone who was important to them and made sure they were completely satisfied with every single detail!
Come the long awaited wedding day… as if Andrey didn’t already have enough on his plate… he had to accomplish everything he planned in… RECORD BREAKING HEAT OF 108 degrees!!!🥵
But nevertheless…. Andrey greeted us with a big smile on his face, dressed so elegantly in black, ready to tackle any obstacle to provide our kids with everything they hoped for from their dream wedding reception!!  It is still beyond us, how he managed to keep his cool, stay so positive and fun and create such an entertaining environment for all of our 420+ guests despite the HEAT!!! Everyone was having such a great time and even after 10:30pm people were still not ready to leave!!! Countless times our guests commenting on how the absolutely LOVED Andrey, the Jazzers and the amazing DJ!!!
These guys didn’t allow any conditions to affect their phenomenal performances and helped create that unforgettable Fairytale Wedding for our daughter that we prayed for!!!! From the bottom of our hearts… THANK YOU Andrey!!!
Hands down… BEST HOST… INCREDIBLY TALENTED PERSON!!!< /Review>

Don’t even know where to begin!! The day we went to meet with Andrey to talk about our wedding we knew we made the best choice with our host. He had a list of questions ready for us upon arrival, and shortly after he had a program outline ready for us to review :) He really wanted to know what kind of wedding we wanted and who our family and guests are. He wanted to make sure he would be engaging both families together as one family. He kept the wedding alive and a wedding full of laughter and love! He always made sure we were aware of his next move during our reception and always made sure we were doing okay. We felt so loved and happy on our special day. Andrey & DJ Essence had the right music playing and had us and the crowd in their feels! We would choose them over and over again and are so blessed and happy we had them as our host & Dj! Like we said earlier and will continue to say, Andrey’s Events is the perfect choice! Thank you so much for everything you guys did for our wedding!<//text>

I've never written a review but just from our first meeting with Andrey, we already knew we made the best choice hiring him and his dj for host/entertainment at our wedding. First meeting, he came prepared with a list of questions about our wedding, us as a couple, our guests, bridal party, etc. At our final meeting, we made sure to go through the entire program for any changes. Andrey kept the whole event on schedule. You can tell he truly loves what he does!! He is so fun to work with, so positive. Felt so loved and celebrated on our day! Everything we hoped to get out of this special day, he delivered and exceeded even our expectations. What is so cool about Andrey is that he involves the guests in his games, questions, songs (he might just have you serenade the bride&groom lol). He is just so interactive with everyone at your wedding & doesn't just talk at them like some hosts do. Most of our guests stayed till the very end!!... which is pretty uncommon. We still get compliments on how amazing our host was. He is just that GOOOD! don't believe me? hire him, we promise you won't regret it!!</Text>

Andrey did an amazing job hosting not one but BOTH of our receptions. My wife and I had to change our wedding day plans due to the pandemic. We decided to do two receptions that were each two hours long. Something that we loved about Andrey was that he was supportive and eager to take on the challenge. Each reception had different age groups and Andrey was able to accommodate to each. Everyone absolutely loved him. He made both receptions very fun and our guests truly had a good time. After our receptions, we had guests telling us that it was the most fun they’ve had in a while. During the wedding planning process he was easy to reach and incredibly understanding. If you are unsure about hiring Andrey as your host, this is your sign, DO IT. He was worth every penny.<//Text>

Can I just say WOW!?!
I have seen you do many weddings and no doubt you have always done an incredible job, but for our wedding I truly felt as though you catered your demeanor specifically for us. You are most definitely not a “one size fits all” host, you adapt to your couples and deliver exactly what they always dreamed their weddings to be.
You took so much stress off of our wedding especially planning during very uncertain times, we knew that this portion of our wedding would not waiver regardless of our circumstances. You were an obvious choice from the start, we didn’t even look into anyone else, and I honestly believe that’s when you can freely say a you MADE it! What you have created and curated for yourself over the years is phenomenal!
People love you, they trust you, and most of all they look forward to their big day with you in mind knowing you will kill it creating the vibe and atmosphere. Your charisma is contagious and your talent is unmatched. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for making it out to our wedding and having a blast with us.
We enjoyed every minute and wouldn’t change a thing. Exceptionally satisfied to say the least.
Be blessed in abundance! 🧡<//review>< Pictures>

Wow wow wow!! It’s been exactly a month from the happiest day of our lives, and we couldn’t be more excited to share this with you! Everyone we got to talk to after the wedding was so happy with the entertainment and the program you pulled off on our day!! Bringing in a mini basket ball hoop and playing hoops in the middle of our wedding was genius😂 !!! Thank you for making our wedding so memorable, amazing, entertaining, and everything we wanted!! Your the best man!! Thank you!!

Well I don’t even have words to describe how AMAZING Andrey was on our wedding day! From the start of consultation we already new that we could trust him he was well organized, professional, also very funny and welcoming! We are a very shy couple and wanted to have someone who could uplift the whole crowd and make everybody feel comfortable. He not only did what we were expecting but much more! All the guests loved him and gave us so many complements on the wedding! 😭 we didn’t have officiant and we asked him to officiate us. It was his very first time but let me tell you he made it so romantic everybody was tearing up! It was the most amazing day! We are very thankful that Andrey was a part of our wedding. We had small wedding of only 47 people and without him it would not be the same! So thank you Andrey for the memories👏👏</review>

A Host. An Entertainer. The soul of the company. Some aspire to be, others acquire skills and knowledge to become, and few have a gift. Andrei is one gifted and talented from God!  What a voice! What a charisma!  Natural ability to captivate and hold attention of the ballroom full of people. Very responsible and reliable, great communicator, professional, great sense of humor. If you are able to book him for your event you will not be disappointed. Andrei was a host at our daughters wedding and we are completely satisfied with his performance. He truly delivered!  Thank you Andrei!  Kindest wishes from all of us in Jacksonville, Florida<//Text>

Andrey was an amazing host, and Dj essence was excellent. Everything was perfect, even though there were hiccups Andrey was able to iron them out smoothly as if nothing happened. Everyone at the wedding loved the energy, and told us this was the best wedding they have been to in a long time. They both did everything to make sure our day was perfect, and memorable. I would like 100% recommend Andrey and Dj essence to host a wedding, or any other event.< /Text>

Andrey was an amazing wedding host. We can’t say enough good things about him.
He went above all our expectations.
Everyone who attended loved him and his energy. For example, by the end of the wedding everyone was still in their seats. (Which isn’t common.)
Has an amazing talent. Great on the spot thinker, AMAZING singer, great program.
Program was perfect mix between heartfelt and fun.
Andrey is also very flexible and easy to work with.
Coming into the wedding we were very informed, and felt assured and comfortable.
If you want to someone to elevate your wedding, Andrey is the man for you. You won’t regret it.</text>

<Text>This is the best host I have ever seen in my life. It was an honor to have the best host at my wedding. Me and wife were so amazed by the work and the effort put into the program. Another thing that was awesome is the ability to adapt to the program, even if there’s a hiccup Andrey will take care of it and make it seem like it’s a part of the program. Very responsive and is able to adapt and serve any group of people. People at the wedding were amazed and all wanted to book him in the future.</Text><user>101824030614097813755</user>< Response>

Andrey went above and beyond our expectations for our recent wedding!! He focused on what was important to us and always made time to listen and hear us our pre wedding!

Andrey was hands-down the BEST decision we made when planning our wedding!! From the moment we met Andrey, we knew we needed him for our wedding. He takes his career so seriously and puts 110% in everything. He is so organized, thorough and knows how to make your wedding run smooth and entertaining. He listened to our ideas, let us create what we wanted for our day but added all of his own personal touches and experiences to make the the day flawless. Andrey was professional, knowledgeable and extremely organized. He was very easy to work with, positive and very accommodating. We had so many guests come up to us telling us that this was the best wedding they’ve been to and they raved about how amazing Andrey was! Andrey was a lot of fun and really great to work work with, there isn’t a single thing that we would change. We could have not been happier with how everything went! I highly recommend Andrey!</Review>

Andrey and his team outdid themselves! We had such an amazing amazing wedding August 15th! Through 110 degree weather and everything being outdoors, Andrey brought everyone to laughter and everyone had such a wonderful time, and even forgot about the heat ! A week later and we still have our guests telling us how fun our program and wedding was!
Andrey you seriously have such a wonderful talent, and from the bottom of our hearts, Vlad and I are beyond grateful for you. For your team, and for your services. We’d choose you all over again 💕💕 blessings!<//Text>

Andrey is the best host ever. He knows how to combine everything in one. Gas a clear line between humor, family relationship and intimacy as well as friends. He hosted our wedding yesterday and that was amazing. I loved everything. He sang a few times, even one if my favorite Ukrainian song. Guests liked everything and were very satisfied with high quality of Andrey’s work. I also have to mention DJ Arman’s work and everything he did for us. He played the songs we wanted and mixed them really well. We enjoyed every moment of our wedding. Huge thanks for that.<//review>

Hands down the BEST service and professionalism!
Andrey was so helpful to work with, we had booked a DJ for our wedding day through him but unfortunately Andrey himself was booked as a host for our date and we struggled finding one. When I messaged Andrey asking him for any recommendations he might have for a host, Andrey was so quick and responsive on helping us out and he got us Scott Freshour ! Scott was AMAZING! Everything flowed so smoothly and beautifully throughout the entire ceremony and reception , from the music to the program , it was Perfect. Highly recommend these guys! They’re awesome and super helpful. They deliver above and beyond.
Thank you so much again for making our dream wedding come true. 😊

Wanted to take some time to say how awesome it was to have Andrey host our wedding. We were initially hesitant about having a host for our small 50 person wedding, but boy are we so glad we went ahead with it. Andrey truly made our wedding memorable! He knows how to feel out the crowd, and keep the party entertained. Andrey is talented in what he does, and aside from that, so easy to work with. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a host, look no further!<//text>

Come our wedding day he pulled off the best wedding reception ever! He always made us and our guests feel super special! Everyone got attention. And everyone got involved.

TheAndreys are very very fun, cool and super energetic wedding+event hosts! I've been to many weddings that were hosted by them, and it was never a disappointment! They always come up with fun and entertaining program that fits for all generations and cultures. Being fluent in English and Russian, really gives them a big bonus!
Not only they are amazing hosts, they can even sing phenomenal songs!
If anyone is considering hiring theAndreys for your big event, you will not be disappointed. You get a whole package of services when you go with theAndreys!</Text>

With the last minute venue change due to covid, Andrey and dj essence drove an extra hour with all of their gear with absolutely no complaints. They had every sound effect, every song, every second of the day planned out. Andrey was constantly checking in with us during the wedding to make sure we were doing okay which was such a huge thing for us even though he was doing absolutely perfect!! Even my dad personally came up and thanked Andrey for making the day so amazing, he had me Veronika in our feels the entire time and made this day such a memory!! He went above and beyond anything and everything we had asked and exceeding every single persons expectations. Andrey and dj essence are the absolute best at what they do and it is truly their God given gift. They have the biggest hearts and I’d have them over and over again if I could, they are worth anything and everything and I am beyond blessed to have had them rock my day. We owe you big time!!!<//review><Time>1600629507756</Time><rate>5<//rate>< name>

Only positive feedback from our guests. Andrey made our wedding a day that no one will forget. Despite being in the midst of the pandemic, he made everyone forget what was happening in the world and just gave us a breath of fresh air to only have us lose it from all the laughter. Professional, Presentable, Classic. Not something that can be taught, but truly a natural talent. Well done Andrey.<//Review>< user_id>

What a Performance! Andrey and his team definitely know how to capture the audience and keep them at the edge of their chairs for the entire event. The question isn't should you book him for your event or not. The correct question is, do you want to walk out after the event and say WOW? The question is, do you want to have a memorable and exciting evening? If you answered yes to any of those questions then you definitely need to book Andrey's events! Thank you Andrey for making my event full of laughter and excitement!</text>

Just got married and Andrey from what we heard was our number one go to. He made our wedding experience the best day to remember. We had an outdoor wedding and never expected it to rain outside. Everyone and everything was getting soaked, but Andrey found a way to keep everyone entertained and together with his team. My wife and I am grateful and happy for choosing Andrey, his dj, DJ Essence, and his talented musical friend we asked at our wedding! I definitely recommend him and his team to make your wedding experience the best there could be!!!< /Review>

Our wedding day was amazing. Dj essence and Andrey were a great team. The crowd was always entertained and the wedding was so much fun. There was never a dull moment and Andrey handled the crowd very well . He was good at changing things up last minute things that we didnt think of before. The jokes and games were amazing and entertaining. We had several people come up to us and tell us our wedding was the best they have attended ever. that Andrey was a great host and the dj worked great with him , with the sound effects and music. Both of them combined was a good time . wouldn’t have it any other way.</text>

Even though it’s been a year since Andrey hosted our wedding, our guests still talk about how fun it was. We even saw our guests coming up to him after the wedding to get his contact information for their future events! From the beginning, Andrey felt like a friend and made us feel like he was genuinely excited to be a part of our day. He created a program catered to our preferences and included some fun surprises throughout. He was able to keep a diverse audience captivated throughout the whole night. One of my fears during wedding planning was that people will leave early, but everyone stayed until the end! It is worthy of highlighting that not only is he a great host, but he is talented with administrative operations. Our wedding had a bit of a late start due to unforeseen circumstances, and Andrey was able to help coordinate and make everything run smoothly. He went beyond what was expected to provide a seamless experience from the start of our wedding to the end. His passion shines in what he does!< /text>

<text>Andrey was the host at my wedding and hands down the best decision that my wife and I made. Andreys energy is unlike any other, as a host he doesn't act and put on a show, he is genuinely just a very outgoing, positive and funny person. He is very easy to work with, we told him what we wanted and had expectations for how the wedding was going to go and he exceeded all of our expectations. Whenever any little problems came up that we didn't expect, Andrey had it covered and it was a stress free environment for everyone. 10/10 would recommend him as a host!< /text>< gmapID>

Me and my husband recently got married just a couple months ago and we are still remembering our big day like it was yesterday! We totally miss it and wish it lasted so much longer! It was so much fun thanks to Andrey!
The moment we got engaged, we immediately knew we wanted Andrey! There was no way we would settle for anyone else . We knew he gets booked fast , and you can’t blame the guy, he’s very popular, young , energetic and is extremely talented at what he does! He has a lot of great ideas, handles things accordingly and professionally, and is very helpful in recommending different vendors. He was mind blowing and rocking out our entire event! All our guests loved him and the entire program, it was such a great vibe We did not want it to end :)believe me ,he is so worth it! he put a lot of time and energy into creating everything we planned! We also booked Dj  Armen and Dreams& Designs through him and loved having them as well! Our dreams became into a reality ! Thank you thank you so much for all you hard work and effort. We totally appreciate everything you and your team have done for us to make our special day incredible❤️</review>

We had one of the Andreys host our wedding and it was one of the best decisions we made! Our wedding was absolutely perfect and the crowd loved him as a host! The entire time we kept hearing how everyone was saying this was the best wedding they have ever been to and at the end of the night no one wanted to go home and that is all because of our host! Definitely worth every penny we spent. He did both English and Russian which was a perfect combo for our guests. I would highly recommend him for any event! He left everyone in a happy mood and that feeling is something everyone will remember about our wedding! So a huge thank you to him!<//Text>

<text>If you’re looking for a fun, engaging and AWESOME emcee, look no further!
Andrey Kazak did an AMAZING job hosting our company Christmas party this year! He met up with us a few times before the event, made sure that what we saw for this party, he was able to reflect. He hosted the entire evening perfectly suited for our crowd, which ranged from 18-75 year old! He got everyone engaged, laughing, and having fun! Andrey was able to feel the crowd and adjust the program throughout the night according to the vibe of the people at the party. It’s been a few days since the event and we are still receiving texts and emails about how amazing Andrey was. HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR ANY EVENT!</text>< user_name>

<Review>HE IS AMAZING!!!! If you're on the fence on whether to book a host or not DO IT. I was super stressed about coordinating all of my vendors and over FaceTime he looked at me and my husband and said "TRUST ME , I GOT THIS" and we did and we had the most amazing stress free day ever. He made it such a breeze for us. Coming from a conservative Russian background and American background he mixed everything effortlessly. He made it seem as if it was one big celebration for us all. He had everyone laughing (young and old),he kept everyone entertained and all the vendors in check for us so we were able to sit back and relax and enjoy. It's crazy to think we weren't going to have a host but we are so greatful we did, WE COULD NOT OF DONE IT WITHOUT ANDREY!! He has now become someone we consider a great friend. Totally worth everything. He really gave us his all ❤️, Our loved ones are still talking about how good of a host he was, American and Russian.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Andrey was hands-down THE BEST decision we made when planning our wedding!!!!! We had so many guests coming up to us telling us this was the best wedding they’ve ever been and how amazing our MC was! I could tell right away that he has been doing this for a long time! He thought of things that I wouldn’t have thought of, had great ideas, and listened to what we actually wanted! In addition I needed someone translate for my dad and some of my guests since they didn’t speak English and he DID AMAZING!!!! Best decision ever!<//Text>

Everyone loved his energy and passion, and we wouldn't have been able to do the wedding we want without him. We got so many compliments from family and friends as well. He was on top of it with all of our requests and changes, and even checked in with our parents to make sure the wedding was going how they wanted it to go too. The program flowed perfectly and it was a good mix of everything. I had an absolute blast at the wedding and would absolutely recommend hiring Andrey as your wedding host.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

The Andrey’s are awesome! They had the whole crowd entertained throughout the entire reception. I have attended two weddings where they were hosting, and I can say that I will definitely entrust them to host any of my events. They make the crowd laugh and they know how to make sure everyone is happy. The Andrey’s are good at what they do, so don’t hesitate to choose them for your event. It will be the best decision you will make for your event!< /review>

You brought life to the wedding and made it very entertaining!

We are SO glad we chose "TheAndreys" for our wedding. It was a lot of fun and guests were entertained until the very last minute. The wedding was interrupted by the fire drill but they did a wonderful job getting all guests back together and got them focusing on the wedding again. Thank you Andreys for this wonderful time we had together. I don't even know who can be better than you at what you do. Everyone loved you and was very excited and happy after the wedding. YOU ARE THE BEST< /text>

<name>Serge Yantsevich< /name><review>Andrey is very attentive to the mood of the crowd and has a great grasp of how to steer it into a fun interactive direction. He’s great with kids and the crowd interaction and jokes are on point and fun, not awkward or stale like you might find with some hosts. Our wedding was awesome and went by in a blur with everyone asking for more. I’d highly recommend him if you want someone who’s very attentive to details and who brings lots of enthusiasm and energy in all the work he’ll put in with you from the very first meeting, to the wedding, and in all of his interactions with you. Can’t recommend him highly enough!<//review><rating>5<//rating></record>

We absolutely loved working with the Andrey’s! We had the privilege of having Andrey Kazak host our wedding and he was so so simple and fun! He took the whole reception into his hands and we were stress free. Though no wedding goes exactly as planned, he was there to make sure it flowed well and that it was a day to remember. Our wedding was quite a big wedding and he was able to handle a crowd with different types of people. We did have some older family members/guests who were not the biggest fans of the program/noise ... but it was our wedding not theirs. And we are very happy we chose to go with the Andrey’s. He is very professional, fun and he tries his best to have the crowd enjoy any event.

Also, side note, he goes above and beyond in every way he can. We had some problems with sound/music... and he was able to take care of everything on his own. He’s outstanding. Such a blessing to have had him at our wedding.

Thank you Andrey’s!!</review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>Choosing to fly The Andrey's into our town to host our wedding was one of the best choices we made. They flew into a town where they had never hosted an event and made a highly talked about reputation for themselves. (I have a feeling they will be going back) Since the wedding was an American/Russian wedding we had to ask even more from them. They listened to our desires/request and made the wedding so much fun for us, our wedding party, and everyone else who attended. Although there are no plans for my wife and I to ever get married again, we would love to hire The Andrey's for any of our future events! With that being said, if anyone decides to hire these guys please send my wife and I an invitation! These guys are the real deal!< /Review><resp>{'time': 1568171790747, 'text': 'Thank you for trusting our company and flying me out to your town.\nWhat a wonderful experience & successful job.'}<//resp><user_id>110715643134439290624< /user_id>< username>

We couldn't ask for better wedding hosts! They helped us plan our wedding just the way we wanted. Throughout the whole reception, we had nothing to worry about because they took care of everything. The program they made was perfect for our guests and for us. They were super reliable and were there for us every step of the way. We highly recommend them!< /review>

<Text>All my life I told myself I will NOT have a boring wedding and let me tell you, it was far from boring. The day before my wedding, Andrey called me to tell me he got extremely sick. He reassured me that he would still make it to my wedding. Due to his health, he was going to fly out his friend Kirill, to help co- host the wedding. He covered Kirill’s flight fully and reassured me that everything will be fantastic. I really appreciated that even with his critical health condition, Andrey did not cancel on our wedding, but did everything possible to make our wedding memorable. It showed how important his clients are that he made us priority. When we saw Andrey the day of our wedding, we could right away tell that he was very sick. However, despite how he was feeling, he pushed himself and gave us a night to remember with his energy and humor. Most people even told me later that they didn’t even realize he was sick. Andrey and Kirill made our wedding so romantic and enjoyable and they were so easy to work with. We had almost 300 people at our wedding and they kept them entertained, laughing, and wanting more. At the end of the wedding, everyone was still in their seats which says a lot about a wedding. So many people told me how much they enjoyed our wedding and that it was the best one they have been to. I am so grateful for Andrey for making our wedding such a memorable one!< /Text>< pictures>

Andrey K was punctual with beginning time, he came in before our ceremony and had a briefing with the whole Bridal party, great at communication.
Throughout the whole event our guests had ear to ear smiles on their faces.
When we ran Into a few issues in the program (slide show computer glitches that was on the venues end, a few additions and announcements that we failed to communicate to Andrey prior) he thought quick and on his feet, the guests had NO idea that anything was ever wrong and had a great time.

HIGHLY recommend this professional event planner.

What a blessing it was to have Andrey host my son’s wedding! Simply put - we were all blown away! We knew he was a professional, but we had no idea what a blessing he turned out to be! His singing voice is beyond amazing, his attitude is warm and inviting, his sense of humor is smart! Several other couples approached him to book for their own weddings. His performance was unexpectedly stunning !!! What a blessing he is to those he entertains! Andrey, thank you for being such an amazing host!</Review>

Where do I even start?? Our wedding was the kind you dream about as a little kid and the kind that turns out better than one could ever hope for. When my husband and I were planning our wedding we knew we just wanted one thing. And that was for both us and our guests to have a fun and unforgettable time. Having a wedding with one side being Hispanic and the other Russian, it was important for us to figure out a way to keep both sides happy and have our wedding run smoothly. Andrey Kazak made our night PERFECT. We could not ask for a better host!!! He kept everyone laughing, and entertained the whole night. It was the best feeling ever being able to look into the crowd and seeing family and friends of all ages clapping, smiling and laughing with joy. We only had to FaceTime 2 times and Andrey did all of the planning for us. It was so awesome because it took away all that stress from us. He was so helpful and was one text away whenever my husband and I decided to change our mind about something. Andrey was professional, understanding, funny, friendly and much more. We had so many people asking us about him and our wedding is one many wont forget. I would not hesitate at all when thinking about booking him! We loved our wedding so much and can’t wait to see Andrey again when he’s in our small town!< /Review>

My sister hired Andrey Kazak to host her wedding and he did an absolutely perfect job. We had one side of conservative Slavic and the other side of non-conservative Americans. He did a great job at entertaining everyone and including everyone. There was so many compliments towards him because he kept the entire evening lively. I wouldn’t hire any other host, he truly is the best!</Text>

<text>TheAndreys are killing the wedding game. It's no wonder they are flown out nationally to do what they do. Not only are they organized, hardworking, and authoritative but all is done with charisma and excellence. Being the skillful communicators they are, you give them a vision/idea and I see them always going above and beyond. I've had the pleasure of working with them numerous of times and they always do a remarkable job.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Andrey Kazak knows how to read the crowd and find the perfect balance of energy to keep them engaged! He’s a natural at keeping people entertained, weddings are so much better when Andrey Kazak is the wedding host. I had a ton of fun at my friend’s wedding with his hosting, I’m definitely going to hire him for my wedding.<//review>

<review>The Andreys were awesome!! They truly made our wedding a day that we will never forget, so many memories made. A lot, a lot of people stayed the whole night at our wedding, they were filled with laughter. The games were really awesome, almost everyone wanted to participate. They took care of everything, we did not have to worry about anything on the day of the wedding because they had our back! :)</review>< rating>

<Review>The day we got engaged, my now husband and I both knew we would have The Andreys host our wedding. From day one, we were never disappointed. They were so easy going and great to work with! We loved their energy and delightful positivity. They really put their heart and soul into what they do. On our wedding day, everything went to smooth! They made us feel at ease and throughout the wedding guests kept complimenting on how wonderful they were! It was one of the best decisions we’ve made with the greatest life time memories. Thank you Andreys, keep it up, you guys are phenomenal. ❤️💜<//Review>< response>

After we booked him both sides of parents (being conservative) kept asking us questions and were hesitant And didn’t want us to have a super crazy wedding! But after they met him and saw how good he is at what he does they loved him instantly!! Everyone kept asking at the wedding where we found him haha! Since it was his first time coming to our city! Our parents were so happy that the wedding went great and said many people were coming up to them and saying it was such a fun wedding! The crazy part is almost everyone stayed till the end!!! That’s what I wanted most is for us to enjoy our day as well as our guests! My husband and I absolutely loved our wedding and thought everything went so perfect! Having such a perfect day made it worth every penny we spent on everything else too!! I highly recommend booking Andrey for your wedding if you want to experience the most unforgettable and perfect day!!<//review>< userid>

The Andrey's hosted my wedding and I wouldn't have it any other way! They did a fantastic job from day 1. Since my wedding was out of state, it was harder to plan out all the details, which made me worried, but The Andrey's came through and full off an awesome reception. Our guests, to this day, still remember our wedding and say how fun it was. These guys hosted plenty of weddings, so don't worry! They know what they're doing! They're full of fresh ideas, so it's never the same program at every wedding. Thanks Andreys!! 👍🏻👍🏻<//text>

<Text>My husband and I LOVED our wedding. Being an American girl marrying into a Slavic family having hosts that can be bilingual and entertain two different cultures was so important. We’ve heard so many positive comments from both sides of the family! Not only did the Andreys do an amazing job of entertaining our guests and running the show on the day of our wedding but they were also a huge help with the Planning process. They referred the jazzers band and fourscore coffee to us for our music and coffee bar and those were some of my favorite things about the wedding along with the fun and unique games we played with our guests. We 100% recommend TheAndreys. Some people say you get what you pay for but Stan and I feel that we got even more :)< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Very disappointing. we had only one Andrey on our wedding .Very expensive but my couple were willing to pay , its not about the money he  couldn't have crowd engaged , instead was just walking around and socializing with individual,then just disappeared, and was looking at the time that is time is over .Again he promised so much , charge a lot but ended up with no program. Stay away from him may be when they are   together its better but i wouldn't risk , its very sad your best get ruined  by some one who is the just for the money ...
we very sad  its life long memory< /Review>

Andrey called us a week before our wedding saying he would be available to host. Being that it was a week away, we didn't know what to expect but knew we were in good hands. We were blown away by the program he made for us! Multiple people came up saying they never had so much fun at a wedding. The energy that comes with his service is unbelievable. I'd highly recommend any couple that is trying to get married to invest in the Andrey's! You won't regret it.</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Given I am now a wife to one of the Andrey's I felt the need to say that my wedding was a total success and probably the funnest wedding I've been to (maybe I'm a little biased). I worked hard to make this day for my groom unforgettable and not make him feel like this is just another wedding. With the help of his partner we planned a wedding of a century. :)! Everything was superb!!! Andrey helped us plan games that have never been played before and he was on top of the entire program. The day flew by quickly but there wasn't a moment we weren't having fun and enjoying our day. Andrey also planned a few surprises for us which was just a cherry on top! He went above and beyond to make his partners wedding the best one yet! And may I not forget the band! The Jazzers were amazing in so many ways. You could tell they knew exactly what they were doing. The beautiful Jazz tunes filled our atmosphere with love and joy. And the biggest surprise was when they accompanied me when I sang to my groom without practicing together even once...and they nailed it to the last note. I may be biased but our wedding was truly an unforgettable day for the both of us thanks to Andrey and the Jazzers! :)<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Andrey Kazak did an amazing job hosting my wedding! He was very professional to accommodate very last minute changes I had. He helped coordinate the music, DJ, Audio setup and the event itself. The wedding was even more perfect than I imagined. The guests were all very entertained and had SO much fun! The guests said it was one of the best weddings they have been to and I couldn’t have made that happen without the help of Andrey. He definelty helped relieve SO much stress by organizing the whole thing. I highly recommend the Andrey’s! You definitely won’t be disappointed. No better host out there.< /Text>

We had Andrey Kazak as our wedding host July 6 of this year. And OMG you guys!!!!!!!! HE IS THE BEST!!! So funny story actually..... our “original” host canceled on us 2 days before our wedding can you believe that!? So I quickly messaged Andrey on Instagram hoping he’d see it since it was 4th of July🙈 and YES! He messaged me back and he was available for our date in 2 DAYS!!!! I knew he was an amazing host so to make it easier and faster I told him I trust him with our wedding that he can do it however he wants. And it was UNFORGETTABLE!!! Our reception was alive! Fun! Lots of people were involved! Everyone was laughing, and guess what!? Paying attention to what’s going on too! I’ve never been to a wedding as good as ours thanks to Andrey!!! Thank you so much we loved you! He deserves wayyyyyy more than 5 stars!!!< /review>

A huge thank you to "The Andreys" for making our day so special and even better than we could've imagined. Not only did he host our wedding but helped me PLAN it!!!! And on the day itself everyone was involved and had lots of fun. Both conservative and non-conservative families were invited yet everyone enjoyed it. Andrey really knows how to balance everything in between. By far all the weddings I've been to that have been hosted by "The Andreys" are my favorite. If you are looking for someone to host your wedding look no more! :)</text>

We had TheAndrey,s(Andrey Kazak) host our wedding and if I had to describe our wedding in one word I’d say MESMERIZING💫. Andrey went beyond our expectations, he made our wedding intimate, heartfelt and full of happiness. Not all hosts go out their and sing at wedding but Andrey just over did it😌  He made our guests feel like it’s their own wedding👌🏻 Every song/game that was played was on point. Hands down the best host in the world 🙌🏻😌<//review>

"The Andrey's" in combination with "The Jazzers" didn't disappoint! The vibe, the atmosphere, the music - perfect combination for a perfect celebration! My 40th is one to remember, thanks to these pros making the evening intimate, personal and very special!  I didn't know WHAT to expect but definitely didn't expect THAT! I trusted the Andrey's with creating the program and choosing the music and they did AMAZING! Thank you guys, very grateful for the experience...< /Text>

Andreys went above and beyond my expectations. We had little time to plan for our wedding but when we met them they had a list of ideas and even helped with coordinating and planning. It was such a relief.  My guests loved them, they were thoroughly entertained the whole night.< /Review>

The number one thing I cared about when it came to my wedding, was a chill atmosphere. Where the guests felt relaxed, comfortable and entertained. I did nottt want any awkward silence, or guests to leave early because of how bored they are.
..... I’m not kidding when I say that The Andreys made that happen x 100!! They are the reason people tell me on & on about how much fun they had at our wedding! People were so involved and stayed till the very end of the program. I don’t know WHERE Andrey gets his energy and charisma from but man that guy was CREATED for this. His voice, confidence and subtle “swag” if you will, leaves everyone tuned in with a smile on their face. I recommend them to every single person I know & hiring them was by far the BEST decision I made for my special day. THANK YOU GUYS!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< review>
Our wedding was a little over a month ago, and it took me this long to write a review! It’s so hard to say anything because of how SPEECHLESS I am of how The Andrey’s made our wedding day. 5 stars isn’t enough! (gonna be honest here) Before picking them as hosts, I was personally a little skeptical of them because i didn’t want our wedding to be anything crazy, but my fiancé (at that time) convinced me. Before the wedding day, we met up with them and they were just trying to get to know us. We got the feeling that, wow, these guys actually want to be friends with us, not only just host our wedding. They went over the whole program with us and left us with no questions. On the wedding day, these guys knew what they were doing. They were so good at keeping everyone involved. Kept making everyone laugh, everyone had such a good time. They knew exactly how to act around the older people and the younger. My mom gave them a little speech before the wedding because I am a bishops daughter and she was worried it would be crazy. But on the wedding day, they made my parents so happy. They asked them throughout the program if everything was alright. These guys made our wedding the most special day of our lives. They went above and beyond. I would 100% recommend these guys. I didn’t regret it one bit. They’re amazing!</review>

I absolutely have no words to say on how amazing our wedding was because of the Andreys. From the beginning they were so easy and fun to work with even though we are from Washington and they are from Cali and they took care of every detail. They set the perfect mood for the wedding, romantic, fun, and energetic. They got everyone in the crowd involved and most importantly they made us (bride and groom) feel special and the center of attention. The vibe was so amazing that towards the end no one wanted to leave!! The wedding wouldn't have been the same without them. The Andreys truly gave us the wedding of our dreams and the best day of our lives!<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Having Andrey Kazak as a host is one of the main ingredients in the recipe for successful event. He brings along abundant energy and enthusiasm, skillfully and gracefully balances between following the script and being spontaneous and humorous to not appear scripted. We were lucky to have Andrey host a sit-down dinner gala attended by over 800 people. An unexpected turn of events left us in the situation where 10 minutes into the gala the co-host had to leave the stage due to severe back pain. Andrey without hesitation took over and single handedly continued the gala. His confidence and professionalism in combination with big heart and amazing personality is what makes Andrey so good at what he does.</Review>< pictures>

Before meeting TheAndrey’s we were on the fence about hiring a host, (which eventually led to two hosts and a dj) for our wedding. Every cent that we invested in hiring these two creative geniuses was well worth it.

Following our reception, our family and friends asked us “how does it feel to be married”, but the next question was “where did you find those guys”?

EASY! After google searching, reading some reviews, and browsing over TheAndreys website, we knew it would be perfect!

What to expect as a client (wedding):

With nearly half of our guests coming from out of town, we wanted to ensure a excellent reception for both travelers and locals. The Andrey's are suitable host for any crowd!

In our case, having entertainment in Russian (some Ukrainian) and English was more than fitting. I am sure they are more than qualified to carry out a service in either language though.

Even though my husband and I are very agreeable people, TheAndrey’s were always up for customization and personalization. I cannot stress this enough!
They don’t bite, so tell them about your preferences. Even on the wedding day, our hosts and Dj were able to improvise due to some unforeseen circumstances.

The Andrey’s were easily accessible on multiple platforms, such as email, phone/text, and even social media…very professional!

The Andrey’s have friends in the industry! We were able to hire catering, DJ, etc through their handy recommendations.

What to expect as a guest (wedding):

Expect the unexpected…(too serious? Lol)
Trust your hosts and newly married couple. You’re in great hands.

Try not stuff yourself with dinner and cake. You’ll be laughing, moving around, and possibly running obstacles.

FUN.FUN.FUN, so enjoy!</text>

they were  awful , spoiled all wedding .I was as a  guest on one of the wedding, and one of the Andrey did a horrible job .in order  you book two of the them the price is more then double , they are extremely pricy . He was just chilling , walking around , making sure he is staying in shade and having his drink ... what is it?
People  work hard , you get paid $400 an hour  to have  good time standing in shade : he said : "I couldn't do anything it was very hot!!"

the guests wanted to participate , asking him  to participate , he just ignored , half of  the program that he planned to do was not even performed .Guest felt so disengaged , and just started leaving the seats and walk round , one of the reason because nothing was happening .. I spoke with parents and couple both were very disappointed.they mentioned that prior wedding they had like 4 meetings discussing the plan to the details , i guess that what they charge for , and just show up on the wedding, its already paid , you cannot do anything ...
most  of the reviews that posted are their friends from church , or they do business together .. just wait and see after my review in one day the will be 5 extra positive:)) but in community people already spread the word ..they wont last .That not how you do business. Feel bad for couples who trust them in their special day .Stay away from them .They   are not professionals in any ways ...<//Text>

<review>I don’t think even 5 stars is enough to really express how amazing the Andreys were!
These guys were incredible when they hosted our wedding. Our guests are still asking us and our families daily who the hosts were and where they came from because everyone loved them so much! The Andreys made our day memorable in the best ways. They knew when to joke around, when to get more serious, and did everything in the most professional way. If you are looking for hosts, you will not regret choosing the Andreys.

<text>They were thee worst! They made the crowd feel so awkward with their games. They did not follow the game plan at all. I spoke to the bride after she got back from her honeymoon. She said they wouldnt let her family participate in the wedding. Bride had her brothers band wanna play, they wouldn't let them! The brides sister had to nag them to let the band play.
The andrey that sings was told to sing only ONE song, he sang 3. Took time from the wedding to promote himself. Selfish. They were told not to play one of the games, and guess what,  they did not give a rat's butt that the bride specifically said dont play that game. They played it anyways. Wasted an entire hour if not more, just making the crowd feel awkward. Mind you, this was a more conservative wedding. 'Let's get married', is not a game you play with that kind of crowd. The bride knew that, and specific told them not to play it.
I would never recommend them, ever! Way to expensive. And they dont even do what the bride wants. They do what is best promotion for them. They do not know how to read a crowd. I felt awkward multiple times. This is not how a guest wants to feel.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1568168673062, 'text': "With all due respect, this review is not accurate.

We hired Andrey to host our wedding, and also his band “The Jazzers”. I was so blown away by his professionalism and how easy it was for him to connect with our guests. I’ll admit, I was a little worried about what our reception would be like if we hired him because we are a pretty conservative group. I didn’t want a bunch of games, because I knew my guests would want a lot of time to fellowship together. Andrey was so good at feeling out the crowd, and not once did I ever think that my guests were not enjoying themselves. People came up and asked me where we found him because he was SOOOO GREAT! I’m so happy we hired Andrey and the Jazzers because they made our wedding unforgettable. Do not hesistate to hire him to host because he will make it so memorable! Thank you so much again Andrey!<//Review>

We can only say Big Thanks to TheAndreys for hosting our wedding! They were extremely professional and made sure each step was covered! They went an extra mile for us and one of the Andreys sang few songs ( he has an amazing voice!) for us. All evening went easy and smooth! Katia & Nikolay M.</Text>

Best Wedding Coordinator/Host Ever!

After attending two weddings hosted by the Andreys, we decided to book Andrey Kazak for our wedding, and we couldn’t be happier. Through him we were able to book our DJ and find our videographer, decorator and wedding cake baker (all of which were a spectacular 10/10). He also planned out the entire reception, helped us decide on the games we wanted to play, and was extremely receptive of our input as well.

When it came time to the reception, he made sure everything flowed smoothly, and when we had to change the schedule, he was able to incorporate it without problem.

Bottom line: we would recommend the Andreys (both of them) to anyone planning their wedding.< /Text>

There are only a few things people remember from weddings.. and  that is the food + atmosphere. And the Andreys did it again ✔️
Choosing The Andreys ,to host our wedding , was the best decision we have made !
Prior to our wedding , the Andreys were willing to meet with us , get to know us & create a fun program for our wedding . Right away we felt like we were is safe hands , and we knew they would create an amazing atmosphere at our wedding . Our crowd was a mix of conservative & liberal , but the Andreys were able to bring everyone together .
They were able to seamlessly make both sides of the family/friends feel like 1 whole family.
Evaluating our guests throughout the wedding ,all we would see is smiles all around.
After the wedding , we received lots of  compliments/feedback from our guests about the wedding , and absolutely everyone loved the vibe + program.
Thank you Andreys !

<Review>I knew I was going to ask the Andreys to host my wedding long before I met my husband. I went to one of my best friends wedding in San Francisco many many moons ago haha and it was literally the most relaxed, fun, involved wedding I've ever been to. 5 years later I was proposed to by the man of my dreams and remembered to call up these AMAZING guys and ask them to set up our ambiance.
Not disappointed. Worth every single penny. I can't speak on their event planning, because my mom got us a different event planner (however they're obviously amazing! Just look at all of those events they've planned!!)
I can with 100% certainty say that they are amazing hosts. They made our entire bridal party feel special and found ways to make all of our guests feel involved. Most importantly they made us feel like super stars :))) haha
They give great advice, are super open to every idea, and overall an amazing pair to work with.
My cousin even said she wants to fly them out to Texas one day when she gets married 😂

Anywho. I could go on, but I think you all get the idea here. So, book The Andreys and happy planning!! :)</Review><name>Tanya Alexander< /name></record>

Amalia was attentive but very patient with my husband and me as we shopped for a new sofa sectional and ottoman for our family room. Amalia has a great design sense and took the time to first educate us about sectional style and cushion options. After showing her pictures of our newly remodeled kitchen/family room and our very specific measurement requirements, she was able to give us quotes at the “good”, “better”, “best” quality/price points. She never pushed us to decide or make a purchase on the spot. On multiple visits, Amalia spent a great deal of time helping us select fabrics. She brought out a wood sample that closely matched our kitchen island, a paint wheel with our wall paint color and rug samples so we could see them against the possible fabric choices. Her advise was invaluable in helping us come to a decision. If you are looking for excellent design help and personalized service when making your next furniture purchase, go visit Amalia at Bassett Furniture in La Jolla.< /text><userid>115983837019943317147</userid>< time>

Later we went to the store and they selected beautiful fabrics for the sofas, chair and pillows. Together they took all the stress out of furniture shopping and it was actually fun! Today the furniture was delivered in less than a month and Juan and his partner set it up as well as explaining the cleaning and function of the pieces.  Very impressive service from start to finish!  Thanks so much!<//review>< pics>

Loved creating a couch that was a perfect fit for us. On delivery the sleeper mechanism required repair that was taken care of but added an extra few weeks of waiting. Also needed to ask for arm covers that we had ordered but didn't receive. We would go back to Bassett for the quality and personalized service.</review>

We had an excellent experience with Bassett Furniture in La Jolla when looking to replace our living room furniture following an extensive renovation. We worked primarily with Mike Bell but they have a team approach to ensure you find just what your looking for without any pressure. They came to our house and took detailed measurements of our limited space and came up with a wonderful design maximizing every square inch but still with lots of room. We were then shown a computerized view of what our furniture choices would look like in our space. It was delivered yesterday and is perfect!! We also benefited greatly from their wonderful Black Friday sale! But the service, follow-up and quality is what really counts. We highly recommend them.<//Text>

The team was great in helping look at all the options and pick great fabric for the coordinating pillows. We had to have the delivery by a certain date and while they could not guarantee it, they pushed the order along and the delivery happened a week earlier than expected. Not to mention the the couch is well made and a great addition to our home.<//Review>

<review>I've been dreaming of a new couch for a few months. Returned to Bassett today to "look" and ended up with a new sectional. Staff listened and offered opinion. We also had fun selecting fabric and pillows. Looking forward to getting my custom made in America furniture in a few weeks.</review>< gmapID>

Eddie Rameriz, the store Manager is wonderful.
He  is a great designer and  very accommodating to work with.
I am very pleased with my sectional.  IF it weren't for Eddie, I would have given up on Bassett La Jolla.

The sales staff , however is horrid .< /Review>

I was looking for a nice sofa. I went to several stores and I just saw a new Bassett Furniture in my neighborhood. I decided to take a look and I like the huge selection, the design and the customer service excellent. They delivered my sofa on time as promised. Amalia did a wonderful job showing me how to enhance the sofa with other decorations and colors matching it.</Text>

Gas and convenience store in Montague proper. They have a wide selection of groceries and supplies as well as a deli with cook to order options like burgers and fries, sandwiches, premade pizza, hot dogs, nacho chips, etc. A great go to if you need a quick fill up and food.< /Text>

They hired a bright young man Jacob Bristol and as far as I'm concerned that's the best decision the manager could have made! He goes out of his way to help customers with a positive attitude and a smile on his face! A Employee like that keeps customers coming back!!</text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Horrible service this morning from a rude employee. I wasnt given the right food item even though I had told them so they continued to argue with me. They didn't  even know the difference between a jalapeno popper and a cheddar muncher. When I gave them proof that the item was wrong they still argued. I paid for this item and simply wanted to correct it but they refused. Very disappointing, won't be going back for a while<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>If you need replacement of any kind of keys car, home etc.., this is the place to go! They were very helpful and very nice. My mom had 2 car keys with remote replaced for a very good price! She would have paid 3 times more at the dealer. I had my 2 remote control covers replaced for my Chevy Tahoe and they work like a charm! We are very happy with overall service and price.

Excellent service. The locksmith was on time in spite of the heavy snowfall that day and did his job to perfection. Slight delay in invoice generation but I was assured they will take care of it going forward. I highly recommend them.< /review>

"We bought our new home finished and had different keys for every door. I called R&D Key Solutions and not only they there within an hour , but they were so professional, quiet and fast!

They explained different options, made a reasonable recommendation.

I needed to get the locks on my business changed and turned to Google as I do for many things and was fortunate enough to come across R&D key Solutions, It was so easy to schedule an appointment, he was so informative and punctual. I wish every business would operate this way. He came out and was done in no time which was great being as though I had a super busy day and many customers to tend to. Aside from all of that he was pretty hot, and smelled good.< /review>

Mr. Dan  is the best! He helped me out with a tough job fixing the lock on my driver side door And made my car keys . I thought my key was worn out but it was actually the lock that needed repair. He came by the same day I asked for a quote and not only fixed my lock but also programmed another key I had. Extremely reasonable prices and does a fantastic job.

<rating>5</rating><Text>BEST IN TOWN SERVICE AND PRICE ! Amazing, I called a bunch of places with all giving me the same answers , 230+ and about a hour of service time . Reached out to R&D , response was within 20 min told me he'd arrive 10am-11am called before he arrived and was done well before 11am 👌🏻 I already have recommended and will continue to use you guys for all my locksmith needs.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPT_ONs1HHPoBnMwoxcispdfoDgQEzyoSqS6cs3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><response>{'time': 1573650791572, 'text': 'Ty for you great review'}</response><GmapID>0x80945fc4ed7d0901:0xa5e64d20049fa0f</GmapID></record>

<text>Prices were very fair, half of what I had been quoted by other locksmiths for re-keying my front door locks. R&D key Solutions went above and beyond his job to explain all the working of my locks, ways I can better secure the premises, how to lubricate a lock that is getting stuck, and more. After calling him for a quote he was able to meet with me an hour later. Showed up on time wearing appropriate face mask and face shield and kept distance adhering to all possible precautions for Covid. Look no further, this is the best locksmith you'll find!<//text>< Time>

<time>1611268678513</time><review>We were looking for a locksmith to install a new keypad deadbolt and fix one of our exterior lever locks.

Called to get a quote over the phone.  I ended up having to text technician a few photos of the existing and new lock.  Quote was provided via text within minutes.  AND!! He was able to come out within 2 hours to get it done.  So response time:  Amazing.

Service: technician arrived on time as promised.  He was thorough, clean, polite and professional!

Price:  Super reasonable. Also accepts cash, card, Venmo. So convenient.

Overall: Yes, while we chose to go he based on timing and price, we got so much more. We are extremely happy with the work he did and grateful the amount of time he spent walking us through how to use our new keypad lock.  He's now added to our contact lists for any future needs!</review><Resp>{'time': 1611269305955, 'text': 'Ty for you great review'}< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80945fc4ed7d0901:0xa5e64d20049fa0f<//Gmap_id>< Name>

<Name>Luck Young</Name><time>1610577414849< /time><Review>What a wonderful experience. He answer my call within seconds. He was flexible and very accommodating about timing. His rate was super reasonable.

I thought my iron gate deadbolt was broken. It turned out it was badly installed. Roman took A LOT IF TIME, to get the alignment just right. I offer to pay him extra because the job was bigger, and he REFUSSED! He wouldn't even take a well deserved tip. Best locksmith ever and I am a Landlord and I have used many.

I am sticking with this one.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><UserId.>110290419541773421260< /UserId.>< gmap_id>

He is the man!
I needed a locksmith for my tenant who was locked out.  I wasn't in the borough and have never had this situation happen before so I found R&D key Solutions on maps and said he was 5 minutes away and of course arrived super quick! Took care of the job and was even able to help us change the lock right there with spare keys.  Everything was done under 30 minutes!

Super speedy, reliable and a great guy!! Highly recommend him as a locksmith contact!

Thank you thank you so much for being so quick, and helpful !! R&D key Solutions Saved me from having a panic attack! Lol

Appreciate your help!< /text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I locked myself out of my house last night. I felt so dumb. Luckily, I could borrow someone's phone to call a locksmith. The first two I called weren't able to come help me, but they referred me to R&D key Solutions!

They too were swamped with work (it must've been a strange Wednesday night), but were able to get me back into my house with friendly and skillful service.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I was locked out of my office, and I lost ALL the keys, so I had zero keys. PLUS I was locked out.

They came out within the hour, unlocked our office, and he was able to MAKE a key without replacing my locks or needing an key.

So convenient, I thought I was gonna have to replace the locks for the Building after he unlocked door.

Everything was done within 25 min, from unlock to new keys.

Highly professional and prepared.<//Text>

Dan was so helpful and got us up and running in 15 minutes after we had been trying to get our car unlocked for two hours by ourselves. I highly recommend this company! He called us back immediately and was very kind and customer service focused. Even the sherriff couldn't open the car and told us we were out of luck! Thank you so much again!< /Text>

Not reliable at all. Changed my Ignition switch for 120. And didn’t even do it right and refuses to fix or refund my money. So I had to go to another place to fix their work and had to pay $95. I do not recommend them he didn’t know how to put it in< /Text>

Along my  road trip i made a stop in Fresno California and was unfortunate enough to lose my car keys . I happened to stumble across R&D key solutions who came out in made a new key  within 45 minutes. I was so  grateful to be  back on the road in such a short timeframe.  The service was super fast ,extremely professional ,and surprisingly affordable . Thank you so much for your help and will definitely recommend you to all friends and family I have in Fresno!!! Thank you sooo much !!!</Text>

One of the best locksmith I’ve ever seen
I went to California for a vacation
And lost my 2016 Dodge Grand Caravan keys
It was 2:00 am , thank god they work as locksmith 24/7 hours
Juda came within 20 minutes and gave me 2 car keys with fobs with an affordable Price and a great service
I would definitely recommend them for everyone
Thanks guys !!!<//review>

Eric helped me and he was rather amazing, dedicated, and very very knowledgeable!!! I told him the problem and he recommended a few things, but once I showed him the photo of Al, he went to the back and brought me back a remedy that has already changed my botany teenagers life!! After purchasing the products Eric recommended, I have not been seeing fungus gnats on Al in as little as a few hours! I might also add that I came 5 minutes to closing and Eric was still very friendly and dedicated to assist me with my teenage Aloe barbadensis miller!!😁😁</Review>< Pics>

I love going here. For a small place, the selection of plants, tools, amendments,  and everything else for your garden is outstanding. The service is also top notch.   In more than a  decade of experience with this place, I've never been disappointed.< /Text>

Like any retail that's not at the edge of the Town under the high tension wires by the railroad tracks, I'm sure they have high rent and labor costs and so as you might expect it's pricey. I often come away with treasures I never expected to find; my last trip they had Crista-galli tropical coral trees in the small quart size that had obviously been rooted. What a wonderful surprise it is to find something so exotic in an affordable size. There is usually a really decent section of California natives and selections from beloved regional nurseries like Annie's annuals and lone pine nursery up in Sebastopol. All in all I am very grateful that we have a nursery of this caliber that's walkable for many lake Merritt neighborhoods.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Covid 19 seems to have made stocking ceramics difficult.  Though they normally are a great place to buy a pot, you may be a little disappointed at the moment. They maintain a nice selection of succulents though a little diminished.  I would still highly recommend this store.  If they don't have the pot you want, I would still buy the plant there.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>My favorite garden center in my area. Healthy plants. Healthy trees. Healthy veggie seedlings. Lots of organic fertilizer and amends to choose from. The management and staff are really helpful too!< /Review>< Date>

Almost everything I need, very knowledgeable staff, and they will load your car. Fairly pricey for a place with weeds growing in the pots. Areas are not well-labeled -- it's hard to find things without asking. Good selection of perennials in 6-packs.</text>

In the top 1%-2% in terms of quality. Way worth the visit. You will almost always find unique species, well kept of very high quality. The staff are friendly and even sometimes have a great sense of humor. A civilized ad not-disappointing location. :)</text>

<review>When asked for specific product, (curtain rods), employee waved towards a back wall and said "back there". When I couldn't find them on the back wall, in a huff, the employee walked me back to them, (they were around a corner tucked into an alcove. I needed to ask a question but employee  walked away, with an eye roll, and I had to to go after him, again. This time I asked him to call someone to wait on me. He took offence and I stood my ground until another man came and helped me.
I'll drive to the San Leandro store before I go back there again.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

This is my go to hardware store in Oakland. If they don't have it they can order it for sure. They have a lock and key specialist who orders nearly any hardware you might want. They have a decent selection and tools and they don't price couch. They have a household goods section with kitchen supplies and hobby supplies to include craft paints and balsa wood. I love this place.< /Review>

This store and especially the management, treats disabled patrons with total disregard and disrespect. I watched the manager Tom mock and publicly humiliate a disabled customer, it was horrible to see. I will not shop here and encourage you not to either.<//Review>

Stay far away from this place. They offer you a used glass which is completely fine; however, the used glass they install is completely scratched. Then come to find before they install the door panel I find that they did not remove a single piece of Broken glass from the inside of the door. Horrible service and once confronted the owner starts getting offensive because I called him out on the lackluster service while keeping my composure mind you.</Review>

<Text>RUDE workers! Had my windshield replaced. A day later I heard and felt air coming in from the bottom passenger side of the windshield. That's when I noticed this crack. I figured it would be an easy fix. I returned to have them fix it and they were mad that I returned. I couldn't believe it! After some arguing they said they'd fix it but they didn't have the glue there. I went to get a quote to get it fixed elsewhere and they told me it would be $85. I returned to the rude people who just added the glue. NEVER AGAIN!< /Text>< UserId.>

<Review>This place is very unprofessional. I had my windows tinted with them they give 5 ur warranty on their film when I called to get my tint fixed because it was lifting the guy gave me the run around for months he kept asking me to send him my address and I wouldn’t hear back from him every time I called he would schedule an appointment but never show up or call me to let me know each time I got a different excuse like his phone wasn’t working, his phone broke, his car stopped working, I understand those thing do happen to us all but not every week for months. To think I had recommended them to friends any they also got bad service< /Review><Time>1605898970253< /Time></record></dataset><record>

Excellant customer service....

Clear on installation....

Quick clean job....

Fairly priced....

What else can you ask for!?!?

I gave you a "4" not because there was anything bad about my experience....

Being a small business owner myself (Zamora Fence Repair),  I'm a firm believer that even if you believe you're that good,  there's always room for improvement.

Continued success Sir....

Quick, speedy service, exceptional excellent customer service, perfect comfortable shaded waiting area, and the best price anywhere hands down!!!! At other places on Alameda, or in my neighborhood it cost $150.00, but here at East L.A. Auto Glass , it only cost $60.00!!! Wow!!!! Total deal!!!!!! Seriously, I recommend them to anyone looking for fast service, great treatment, good price, and quality parts.< /text>

<Review>I came here for a windshield installation it was the cheapest from all the places around here and i mean a out 10 spots in a 2 block radius.  But i found out why it was so cheap.. sloppy job had to comeback to get the trim around the windshield install again cause the 1st time they put it on wrong.  And no kind of customer service at all. Rude and i ask for a receipt and the guy hands me a business card. Definitely dont recommend this place for anything.  Hope this helps someone.<//Review>< UserId.>

Horrible job!!! I don’t know how they have 5 stars and I had to rate it with one star to submit review. I know that for $270 I’m not gonna get an excellent or perfect job, but I’ve replaced my other car’s windshield at a cheaper place ($150) and it NEVER gave me any issues. I’ve been here twice to try to fix it and they seem to be bothered by it and when I asked more info about the place and owner, they said they didn’t know anything. The water goes thru the glass, the rubber around the glass is twisted and every time the tailgate opens and closes, the shattered glass inside is pretty noisy.<//review>

<Review>I am new to the area and Charlotte treated me like family.  She is such a sweet and sharp lady.  I will be back for Gas and Groceries often.  Maybe I will get that bottle of Whistle Pig Boss Hog.

Local family owned convenience store and gas station.  Generally decent selection of goods and products that cater to the neighborhood. The staff are usually pretty friendly.< /text>

This Chinese restaurant is tucked away in a Suite alongside a Dry Cleaner and a Dentist office. Usually these restaurants offer some of the same items as other restaurants but China King's Fried Rice is made pretty delicious and they give good portions.</text>

If you’re in San Bernardino...you have to hit this spot. You don’t have anyone being stingy here with portions, they are piling it on like they are feeding two people instead of one.

Tastes great and service is great.</Review>< gmap_id>

Just visited today 2/23/20, very clean, very friendly and the have an A rating. The food is fresh, and the egg rolls I ordered are being made now. Been coming here for years, and it's in top order this trip. I have seen it run down in the past, but maybe its changed owners/management a few times???? I still come here just as long as it's got an A rating. Cant wait to try the jalapeno chicken.</Text>

This place is our nearby favorite. Sometimes, like today, I will go buy two of the shrimp and vegetable soup, and two egg flower soups. Other times it's a combo for each of us. Always fresh, tasty, great spicy orange chicken, and some of the best egg rolls which are nice and thicker. We love it all!</Text>

<review>I was a loyal customer the first three times I went there even though I heard bad reviews about their customer service well today proves what everyone else has been saying the customer service is the worst even though she admitted to me tonight that my wife and I are good customers she was still very rude And very impatient rushing Our order I wanted house special lo mein it was only 730 she would not make it and got very upset and told my wife to hurry up and order I will never go there again even though I live right across the street very disappointed< /review><user>109397373239738130512<//user><Rating>1<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

After reading some reviews I proceeded with caution. I tried the food before picking it and I’m happy I did. The orange chicken was a very large portion breading and had a crunch. The pepper chicken was okay but I won’t be back<//text>

<text>To live around the corner from this place and I've always been loyal and a good customer, today I came  in and Ordered a egg soup and a bowl as I was waiting for my dental appointment next door, the rude lady probably the owner she wasn't aware I can understand and speak Mandarin Chinese. I asked for a cold glass of water along with my food and I'll pay for it then she told me that they don't have ice for water because the owner has to buy it from the supermarket. And ice is only for soda!!! I was like huh?!?!? I said I'll pay and she was just babbling so I told her thank you but I'm leaving. After 8 years of being a customer they were worried about ice. Insane to me.< /text>< pics>

One of the best Chinese foods in San Bernardino. Once you become a regular, they add extra food for being loyal to the restaurant. Ladies don't look friendly but they at least get my order ready quick & out the door 👍Food is always good with large quantities to even serve 3 people. Ignore the other reviews because they're just people who have a limited amount of brain cells. If you're always crying about how you're treated then search somewhere else.<//Review>

The Wonton soup is my favorite, but i do love their Orange chicken too. There's enough seats and tables for the whole family. I totally recommend it.</Review>

I would rate lower if possible. Usually ,I go in there, and it’s a positive experience, However, today was much different. Perhaps it’s new ownership of new workers . Either way, I rushed to the bathroom , as Mom waited outside the door, she is greated with a women saying “bathroom customer only”. I intend on getting food but that made me want to leave. So I order my food, the cashier was very room. So I eat my nasty , the food was burnt and didn’t taste fresh. So I get a Togo bag, lady says only one bad. I then say, well it’s two of us. She say 10cent . So I give her a 1.00 and say I want eight bags. She laugh and said “to much” . I took my two bags and gave her my change .like petty</Text>

Customer service was trash! Lol they couldnt even look at me. Cashier kept daydreaming and it took me forever to get out of there with the food, then when i actually get the food and eat it, the rice tastes stale and as far as the Orange chicken goes, it seems like they put more work into the orange glaze than the actual chicken...because it tasted raw. Me and my mother put it in the trash and went to little Beijing< /Text>

<Text>This place use to be good! The portions where good. Now the portions are not all that great. When you order 3 meat combo the 3rd item would be placed in separate small container. I went there last Friday and got 3 meat combo the last one was beef and broccoli they placed it on top of everything else. All I got was like five broccoli and one piece of meat. I told them something about it and they wanted to charge me extra to add more. I told them I wasn't going to pay extra for something I am already paying to have. They got upset and added more. I will never eat there again. I wish I would've taken a picture.</Text><user_id>105300118239531876403< /user_id><response>None<//response>< Name>

The cook goes to the restroom with his apron still on. When I first saw this it was my first time eating there. I told the manger but she seem to not understand what I was saying.

But then she said ok as if she finally understood me.

Here it is like three months later or so & I'm dining there again because my mother enjoys their food.& I was giving the manager the benefit of doubt that she fixed that situation with her cook.. But here comes the cook going into the bathroom yet again with his apron on.

So disgusting im over this place.
They are not sanitary...
One day their water was off in the building & they still was serving food...

How was they washing their hands & food?<//Text>

I definitely should have listened to the bad reviews I read on this place and not wasted my money, food was greasy and had NO FLAVOR! And there was no chicken in the orange chicken, only flavorless breaded bread! Honestly it was absolutely horrible....<//text>

Very rudy customer service.
I order one order to share , because plate is big for one person. I have to pay extra for second plastic  fork, plastic plate and extra cup. Ladys was very rude and told me that owner idea. After i told them, may be this why this place empty they just start point at me and speaking chinees.
Very rude and cheap place.
P.s. coca-cola that cost 1.00$ cost there 2:85.
Never again.< /review>

< Review>
always sorry to write a bad review.. but it seems that there are MORE  1-star's - than 5-stars..  (see reviews !) .. and this is NOT A GOOD SIGN FOLKS..  the food is = average/ok .. the service is = weak  .. the quality is = average at best (they seem cheap on everything they do - so I bet the food they buy is on the lower-end of the scale) ..  the owners do NOT smile, do not act nice or respectful of their clientele - and HARD to understand what they are saying  (I gave up and just nod and smile) ..  - and OVER-Changed me 55cents ??!!  -why??    .... so if you are reallly hungry and starving for China-food - then ok ...  but I am going to get my asian-fix somewhere else from now on ... too many bad experiences at this place ... I DO NOT TRUST  EATING HERE --  good luck<//Review>

This place has been around for a long and it's so clean and tidy . They have a new car wash which doesn't use those brushes but high pressure water. It's cheap too. Gas prices are always better here. And I just love how friendly the owner is<//text>

<Review>Purchased The Works car wash. It rinsed the dirt off my car. The blower/ dryer stopped after my hood and windshield. There was a barrier keeping me from moving forward that wouldn’t lift and it almost landed on my hood! My car was still totally wet when I drove out of there. I checked with the attendant inside the store and ask him if he had any towels. He said I could use the paper towels. I’d rather not scratch up my already scratched up car. He said I could purchase a soft cloth for $3.99. I asked him if I could have my money back. He said “no“. I expected to have to do some work for my $7 dollar car wash (discounted $2 because I purchased more than 8 gallons of gas). A total waste of my time and money. They were no help to me. I’d rather drive out to Simi Valley for a $6 car wash (Madera and LA Avenue) if I’m going to have to put any work into it, and will also get good customer service. I won’t make the mistake of getting a car wash there again.< /Review>< pictures>

I called ahead of time and asked for an appointment to have information transferred from one phone to another and was told to come in right now because it wasn't very busy. WRONG! The one I spoke to on the phone was the one who checked me in and said she'd help me and 10-15 minutes later, I'm still waiting. This place is so slow but once it was my turn, the young man helping me was nice and took care of the proper transfer. AT & T is never a place I like to waste 1-1.5 hours of my time.< /text>

<review>I went in there to purchase a new phone for my mom and I was helped by Mercedes E. She was helping me so we sat down and she asked me what phone was I looking for and what color so I told here what I wasn’t IPhone SE her  assistant manager Daisy who when I spoke to at first told be she was the store manager was trying to sell me stuff but I didn’t mind that what I did mind was she changed me $328 thinking I bought my mom a phone but Once she told me you still owe on one of your phones $123 and I told my mom we can come back one we pay it off. Before leaving they store I asked and I getting back the $328 which to my surprise she said I was to look at the account and I told them you never told me that Mercedes started to call me a lire along with her assistant manager Daisy and Daisy declined me of calling her boss because in her words they nobody above her and she’s the store manager . The phone was $399. I could’ve went to Verizon. So they charge me $328 to look at my account another $123 to play off a phone and another 399 for the new phone I didn’t mind paying the $328 It bothered me more because they instead that they told me why they took $328 and I said no I thought I was buying a phone instead of helping me and getting the DM number she said call 611. I new the store manager Eric was there he Descalated everything positively I send the email to him to but have yet to hear back I would like to speak with the DM manager in person to tell him how I was treated wrongfully.<//review>< Pics>

Nat was amazing, I went in for one simple issue and she managed to find me a great solution for all my other needs. Will definitely be going back to her for any future business. 👌 also forgot to mention another rep Monica helped me out when I returned and Nat wasn’t available. Both are amazing reps and deserve recognition.<//text>

My husband and I went in to add a new line and Bert assisted us, he was great! He was able to find us the best deal for our current plan and made the switch over quick and smooth! Definitely recommend his service if you visit the Hanford AT&T!</review>

<Review>This is my go to AT&T store. I have been helped by Jose J. multiple times now, he constantly provides great service and is the reason I continue returning to this store. I live about an hour away, but I am always willing to take a drive to Hanford to receive his outstanding help when it comes to purchasing a new phone,  basic questions, and more. Thank you, Jose!</Review><user>100413187684785151049</user><user_name>Edward Lee Aderhold III</user_name>< pictures>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Recently went into the store and was helped by Jose J.  I could not have been happier with the service that he provided. I had many questions as I had not had the best service with other locations, however, the service provided has completely changed my mind and I left feeling very satisfied with my purchase. Jose was very easy to talk to and didn't make me feel intimated or bullied. I will definitely come back!<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x8094c3787e6e0807:0xdac40e8d01465d32</gmapID></record>

Eduardo is a life saver. I thought I had lost all my family  pictures on my phone when I dropped my phone in the water. He was so professional and fast help me get a new phone and transfer all my pictures and contacts to the new one. This young man deserves a raise,  I left the store with everything I needed and every question I had answered. Definitely be coming back and telling my friend and family. Thank you Eduardo.< /Review>

Amazing service!!! Went in with my mom to browse. Ozzi showed us some plans and we left with two phones and plan that was $20 cheaper a month than our old provider. Could not recommend Ozzi’s services enough!<//text>

Gregory and Bert both helped me out. Gregory helped me with my upgrade to the new S21 Ultra. Then Bert made sure to help me move all of my information to my new phone.  They were great.< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>My family and I opened up a new line in order to take advantage of the iPhone 11 promotion to get it half off. Steven helped us with that and was very informative. I was going to use that line and was switching over from Verizon. I wanted to keep my Verizon phone number and Steven said that was very much possible. I had to come back another day to port my Verizon number to my new att line. I was then helped by another employee who said porting my phone number to this new line was not possible. Luckily, Steven was in the store. We asked for Steven to help us and he was able to make it work.

< Review>
I went inside the store informed Victoria of what I was looking for, she told me I had to wait in line, okay I understand helping in the order that you arrive is perfectly fine. I spent 2 hours in line outside for them to tell me they didn't have any samsung tablets in stock. The  salesperson who finally helped me was named Chris. It seemed like he tried to switch my plan for a more expensive plan. They spent so much time trying to promote their TV service and unlimited plan, I went knowing what I wanted and it felt like they just wasted my time taking me in circles trying to get me to sign up for more of their services when they could have just told me from the beginning that what I wanted wasn't available.<//Review>

I wanted to thank Nathalie for her excellent service. This is my third time with her and came just from Sprint because I loved her service. I enjoyed how much she explained my plan and broke down all my options. When I stop by, I would love to be helped by her!< /Text>

<text>Worst staff I’ve ever met.
No one helps, they like to stand around and not help customers at all.
Was there for almost two hours and they don’t even come back to tell you anything. They just walk around swinging their keys and staring.
Only one girl was nice enough to give us an explanation and it didn’t even make sense. Said that all those people were managers.
So what? You have 6 managers that can’t help customers?< /text><rating>1</rating>< time>

< Review>
Numerous employees standing around talking while one person gets helped and the rest of the customers are waiting.. it's almost comical. They helpful though.. it also seems like they purposely only carry the most expensive variations of each phone.🤔 Can't knock the hustle! [If you wanna upgrade, do so through the app.. and have it sent to your home, or the store and you can quickly pick it up from there.]</Review>

Amaya and Elex provided excellent customer service as well as resolved several issues I had with my phone. I was hesitant to transfer to a new phone and they worked diligently to ensure that everything was completed correctly. I appreciated their knowledge and expertise. An additional manager, Alex ensured that I was receiving the support I needed, all while demonstrating an evident positive working relationship with the employees.
I would highly recommend these three AT&T empioyees and the store location to assist other business owners.</review>

Ivan went above and beyond to make sure I walked out of att with everything I needed. I was there for almost two hours and he made sure everything was squared away for me without me ever having to speak to any rep on the phone. He knew exactly what numbers to call for all the technical issues I was having with my account. He was very patient and explained everything in detail. Thats the type of customer services everyone should practice.<//Review>

I went into the store to pay my bill. The keyosk was down. I sat next to three people at the next table that were using their phones. I knew one worked there because she had looked up from her phone when I came in a,d asked if I was making a payment. I said yes and co tuned to the keyosk. After I found d itwas down I returned to the table next to her and the two others. She looked up at me a couple times then went back to her phone. After several minutes another female got up and asked if I needed some help. I then determined she was an employee and not a customer getting assistance. She helped me and then I also determined the third person was also an employee. All three were on their phones playing or doing whatever while I sat waiting.  So so unprofessional and I would never have any of these 3 working for me. FYI I was the only customer in the store.

I just read the "scripted" response. It is obvious that poor employee performance is of no concern for you!<//text>

I took my 83 year old mom in today to replace her flip phone.  I expected poor service, which I'd experienced in this same store two days earlier, but instead we had Christine.  I would nominate her for an award if I could.  She was patient, knowledgeable, warm, made great eye contact with my mom (seniors are  often overlooked or dismissed), and listened to what my mom's needs were.  If all reps could be like Christine, we'd all much happier.  Thank you Christine M.  You were sincerely aporwciated.</Text>

Back in Nov 2018 I went in person to canceled my phone and tablet plan. I been having issues with AT&T with my home internet, so I called them. I just found out on Sept 16 2019 that they have still been charging me for the Nov 2018 services. I talked to multiple people and managers including, Shannon ID # SD958M, in AT&T and they basically said sorry your fault we can’t do nothing about it. They took $450 out of my account. Without my consent. Immediately, I canceled everything and anything due with AT&T. I am sure I’m not the only person that they have done dirty to. I recommend NOT to get services from AT&T.< /text>

This is a corporate store so it should have the best people, but that seems to be far from the case. Managers that don't care what is happening, and undertrained staff. The young lady that helped me initially was trying very hard, but she didn't have the proper tools to be able to do the job correct, which is why I gave 2 stars instead of just one.<//review>< Pics>

Most tech-oriented places can give you the run-around, a headache, or will have you waiting for extensive amounts of time... Not here! I am obsessed with this AT&T location.

Berto S. is the best person to go to when you need any questions answered about any product. He truly is a "no nonsense" salesman, and is so engaged with his guests (seriously, the man has a passion for this stuff!). Highly recommend you book a time with him for your next inquiries!< /text>

<response>None<//response><pics>None</pics><Review>I came to this AT&T store one other time and had a wonderful experience. Someone helped me switch phones without a fee.

This time however, was not a fruitful one. I came in to switch my phone once again after it broke. A man of Hispanic heritage helped us out, having to call over his manager after explaining to us that for a SIM exchange, it was a charge of $5.36. Any time my grandfather changes phones for anyone in my family, they have NEVER charged him for a SIM. My grandfather was angry, you could hear it on the phone - he's been a long time reoccurring customer for many many years and never have we been told that we had to pay for it.
The retail sales manager, Manuel Gomez (kinda looks like DJ Khaled if you ask me) was extremely rude, was not helpful in the slightest, and didn't have any problems with having attitude towards the end of our visit. We scheduled an appointment but decided to come in the next day with the stupid $5.36. A man named Steve (mind you he was white) helped us with ease. We didn't have to pay a dime and he put in my SIM just fine. The manager saw me and who I was with the day before, and didn't even give us a look, apologize, nothing! He actually went out on his lunch break with an employee who gave me a dirty look.

The thing I really didn't like was during our visit, this elderly black woman was seeking some help for her phone service, to no avail. Not one person helped her.

Overall, I felt disgusted at the fact that a phone store was ready to help "their kind" faster than anyone else. I wouldn't recommend this at&t store unless you HAVE to go there, or are OBVIOUSLY of Hispanic heritage, which we are, but apparently we don't fit the "profile."<//Review>< user_id>

<Text>The worst experience ever!!! Took 2 hours to have a new otter box sceen protector applied which I purchased from AT&T. Terrible outcome, scratches, bubbles etc. My 4 year old grandson could have done a better job. Now I have to get another one. What a joke. They have no business allowing there untrained staff attempting to do things like this. How convenient they don't have a replacement cover in that store.< /Text>< Name>

My parents went to this store today they left at 10:10am. They were helped by a employee named Josh who stated that our plan had no upgrades available. Flat out lie. Instead of waiting 10 minutes for the payment to be processed he told my father it would be $276 to pay of his phone and get a new one. My dad needed his phone for work. So after they leave my parents call me upset because they had checked before they went to said store online it was $134 to pay off his phone but my mother had an upgrade available. Despicable. What are your employees pocketing people's money and lying to make a commission. I will be contacting corporate. I've been a customer for over 10 years and I'm pissed.<//review>

I bought a new phone here and used the call before hand option. Fast service and they had the product in stock. The only weird thing was they kept asking why I was going from an iPhone to Samsung. I said better performance and I can do more than iPhone. Also a lot of employees just stand and wait, I guess there is nothing else to do in there.<//Text>

<text>So nice before the sale- once that contract is signed THEY COULDN’T CARE LESS about customer service. They got our address wrong IN THE STORE WHEN WE FIRST OPENED THE ACCT and Manuel ( store manager) PROMISED TO FIX- Still not fixed- won’t return phone calls, won’t fix address, when you call they are rude and say they are too busy to help. They weren’t “too busy” while we were spending thousands in there! Waiting now for a call from district manager... shouldn’t have left Verizon- CHEAPER, FASTER SPEEDS, easier to get help. AT&T by far the rudest! Too much money to get treated like this.< /text>< Pictures>

Internet is so slow and constantly lagging. You're better off with comcast. Comcast has a 30 day guarantee, with AT&T You are stuck with a contract after the first day. Way less channels or none-interesting channels.< /Text>

<Text>Don't by setup direct tv, promos for a phone, they make sales promises that day u get your new Tv sales, & they have u purchase a phone, do not buy their products, sales pitch, they are a rip off when u get your 1st Bill,  you get charged for things they never tell you upfront when U were signing up, they miss lead U in so many ways, run away from AT&T, Mgrs.=Are no help either, dont sign a contract with them, mark my word U are makening a mistake! Plz shop else where. They wont correct your contract or billing invoices for 3 to 6 months to a year. DON'T forget to NOT sign up with them, they lie about the promos and you get screwed, they take advantage of your $pocket book, your own cking acct. There sales pitch is all a lie!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Literally the worst customer experience I've ever had the employees have zero knowledge on their products. High pressure sales situations with false and misinformation. I highly recommend everyone to go with a different carrier, this branch needs to be audited on their knowledge and sale practice. The associate will tell you anything to make a sale it's actually quite misguiding and unethical. 1/10 save your time and money and choose someone other then these scam artists.<//text>

<review>I really regret going with AT&T. I went last month to pay my bill. I ended up getting "talked" into getting DIRECTV. They schedule for installation that week of September 14th. It's October 4th & this is their 5th time rescheduling me because of a no show! Also I was billed 162$ for something I don't even have yet! Every time I call they don't answer (my caller ID pops up). Sick of the run around, I definitely don't recommend them at all. They only care about their damn commission, obviously not the customer.  #BADBUSINESS 👎🏼<//review><resp>None</resp><rating>1< /rating>< date>

Very long waits. Be sure to free up your schedule if you need to go there. Although some of staff is helpful, most are not knowledgeable. You can only go to the store if you're purchasing something. If you have an issue with a product,  they'll make you wait only to tell you to call an 800 number. They only care about sales and not satisfying the consumer.< /review>

The sales person was very nice BUT, I was informed it would be a buy 1, get 1 free offer and I called to ask why my bill was showing that I was paying for both phones, all they said was the sales person was misinformed. I payed 600 that day thinking one was free but it wasn't. Now I'm stuck with a contact paying 2 iPhones, and all they offered was returning them and there would be no fee. I already spent hella money to get them, I can't let it go to the trash. All sales people need to be CLEAR with "special" offers. Thanks AT&T!!!! Nice one.< /Text>

<Review>Majority of the employees are kind, My worst experience was with Emily. She was VERY rude and EXTREMLY pushy. I understand they have to upsell to meet their goals each month and what not but eventually I was very clear with my answer for the Tv plan and she got rude and snappy with me when I continued to tell her no. Her eye rolls and lack of customer service we’re not appreciated. Please make sure that your employees know when enough is enough.<//Review>< pictures>

I just tried to purchase a $100 gift card for a friend's birthday. I was initially told there were 4 people ahead of me, wait time unknown. After a google search to check and see if there was any other option to purchase the card, I went back in to the woman at the front who was only checking people in but seemingly not busy otherwise. She was unsure if they did gift cards. She checked with the manager who also did not seem busy and came over and was also unsure. Then, when asked how much I was going to purchase, and replied $100, the manager told me they only had $25 or $50...and followed that up with the fact that I was now behind 6 people and it would likely be an hour wait. I'm not reprogramming a phone or trying to get to the moon, I'm buying a gift card. Apparently buying 2 x $50 to make $100 was outside their grasp.  In the time it took to decide that math is more difficult than I remember from grade school, this transaction could have been completed. Thanks AT&T Hanford, for solidifying my switch to any other carrier #nailedit</review>

<Text>If I could give a 0 I would. My issue was not resolved, more so when addressing issue I was being ignored and either simply regurgitating a template that they have or changing the focus when the first didnt apply. The issue is a lapse in service where a lesser sister company flourishes.
This is either a result of negligence or ego, and in this day and age the ability to not have signal in a long developed part of the town. RCA had done this, where they were the epidimy of electronics that my dad would bank on way back when. Now they are the lower end budget friendly risk you are willing to take.
The problem is years before they showed their hand, they charged for their name.
I have 7 lines and gave them multiple opportunities to close their service gap and spent hours into weeks to have them not offer a compromise on their half of doing something on their side to resolve the issue, even after politely offering suggestions to set the tone.

**update** since the review we decided, being told too bad sorry about you're luck. We are who we are and you're not going anywhere. We jumped to tmobile we're paying nearly 300 dollars less and I can barely notice a difference. At that for what I was worried in being a difference,  I cant tell at all. The worst is in between the cities in the country I can lose connection for maybe a minute at worse depending where. With that, considering the intermittent loss of service because of hiccup or "servicing" was more intrusive than the situational loss felt here.</Text>< pics>

Josh is the worst rep at customer service .. didn't get me any info when I switched from the note to iPhone 6s Plus . Worst guy ever

^So after I left this review
Joshua the guy I referred to in the review contacted me via Facebook and threatened me and I then contacted the store spoke to a few managers. The area manager got in contact with me and apologized. After that I haven’t gone back to the store. I feel they should have done something to him or compensated me in some way. I will be contacting Human Resources as well as corporate soon.<//Text>

I bought 2 phones through att and the wrong phone was shipped to me. Att told me to come to this location to have my phones exchanged , the employee that attended me was very helpful but he said it was up to the store manager. The store manager was flirting with a girl and took him a long time to come to my waiting table just to tell me that he couldnt help me and that i had to deal directly with at&t. After he told me that , he went back to his office with that girl and closed the door. I was there for another 15 minutes trying to see if i could resolve anything and the gentleman that had previously helped me gave me a number to the territorial manager. I spoke to the territorial manager and she told me she was going to come to my business and help me out with the situation but she never showed up or even bothered to call me back. 20 days later i received a bill for over a thousand dollars and i didnt even used my phones. An at&t customer for 30 years and this is how they appreciate my business , very disapponting indeed.</Text>

<Review>There high-speed Internet is not high-speed. Data coverage is the worst out of all the carriers, but the store is nice and so are the people that work there.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Great customer service in store BUT , NO ONE ANSWER THE DAMN PHONE FOR A 30 SECOND QUESTION. IM NOT WASTING MY GAS FOR A DAMN 30 SECOND QUESTION THATS JUST NEEDS A SIMPLE YES OR NO. PHINE MAKES U HIT #1 EVERY 30 SECONDS AND ONLY GIVES U 4 TRIES BEFORE IT ACTS ALL STUPID. WORST PHONE SERVICE EVER! OH AND I CALLED FOR 40 MINS STRAIGHT!</Review>

<Review>Is it possible for 0 stars? Anyway they entered my name and everything even though I'm pretty sure the doorman worked at McDonald's previously because they didn't fully understand what they were doing. Waited for about 30 minutes and decided to ask McDoorman what was up. They removed my name for some reason so... Oh well! Good thing I was able to waste thirty minutes at att amirightguys?!:)
But it has to its pros. If you have a movie to go to and still have to wait an hour for the movie come to Hanfords att and waste a good thirty minutes before the movie. 10/10 would come again< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I've been there several times, I've never had such a good costumer service experience like the one I got last saturday March 29, 2014.  It's the first time that my visit there was really pleasurable and happy. If you are looking for a great experience just wait for NATHANIEL. We waited more than normal but the wait was worth it. It was wayyyy more better this time than with the last time I went there. The other rep (luis) made me feel ignorant and I felt like he just wanted us to leave so he could go to the next person. He even asked us like "so what do you want me to do?" instead of him offering us different options. Anyway... NATHANIEL THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU ARE AWSOME! :) Veronica and Ernie.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>
