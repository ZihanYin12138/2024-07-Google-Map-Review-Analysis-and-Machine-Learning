Haven't had Pizza Hut in who knows how long, but it did not disappoint. The pizza was good and so were the wings. The wings were probably the best that I've had  from a pizza place like this. I would this place without a doubt. Staff was also very friendly when I showed up to pick up my order.</Text>

I believe first that the drivers must be trained better. We were on the phone for a good ten minutes trying to explain to the driver how to get to my home. Then, because of an online goof, I called to pay for my order with card , but the csr couldn’t pull up my order because the driver had been put back into the system before he got back to the store (by the way) . I was on the phone again with the csr for another ten minutes on hold as he was trying to figure out how to charge me. I ended up opening my kids piggy banks to get the cash out. Then! The csr called me back after the driver had left  to ask if the driver left yet because he hadn’t got back to the store. This was inappropriate and unacceptable . I was trying to enjoy my now cold pizza at this point. We don’t order much from Pizza Hut nor do we have things delivered much, but this was a horrible experience. One that I don’t think was right to get charged for.< /review>

The front lobby was overcrowded with people waiting for their carryout orders.  The curbside delivery did not work.  No staff answered the phone.  I waited over 20 minutes to pick up my order even though it was ready.  My order was also wrong and they missed 2 items.</review>

<text>Wow!  I went in this evening to pick up my two pizzas that I ordered online. I saw two ladies working the back while the young man took my payment at the counter. When I got home I opened the boxes and to my surprise I saw the two best looking pizzas I've ever seen. Really, the ingredients were placed perfectly, the slices were all symmetrical. It tasted even better and was cooked to perfection. I called back in to compliment the cook and was able to get the name of one of the ladies (Rita). You can tell that these workers care about what they put out. My family and I enjoyed our dinner this evening because of the hard work of the Pizza Hut Crew working this evening. Thank you and keep up the good work.< /text>< Pictures>

Worst customer service. 1015pm and they are done for delivery for the night but they close at 12am.  Called dominos pizza after and took my order no problem. Head courters should investigate the hours at this pizza hut<//Text>

<Review>Terrible service. There were plenty of people in the back yet it one person at the register and took long to help each customer. There were several customers that were told one or all of their order was never made. One of my pizzas was not made and I was told "straight up, we forgot to make your pizza". I did not like the way this employee spoke to me and thought I would be "cool" with that. I waited for service and the pizza that was never made for about 35 min. I would not return to this location.<//Review>< rate>

2 stars because service was fast and friendly. But honestly the pizza is subpar when it comes to fast food pizzas. The dough is dry and the toppings and flavor are lacking. I honestly am gonna stick to little ceasars pizza or dominoes pizza when it comes to value or flavor for fast food pizza. Little ceasars has a good 6 dollar pizza and dominoes has a good 5.99 deal. Wouldn't recommend pizza hut. It's overpriced and lacking in quality.<//Text>

<Review>Literally the rudest location EVER. I once had a rude delivery man and complained about him, instead of managers reassuring me that the issue would be dealt with they too were rude. After a year, (today) I called Pizza Hut for a delivery and they said a note had been left on my account and that they could not deliver. A complaint to corporate will be made.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Ordered from this place because the Cuban place was too busy. Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food. No MSG tasted. The sandwich was big and price was good. Will definitely go back.</Text>

I’m in front of the door as we speak, it’s my mother in laws birthday and she was really craving a sandwich from her community and culture and unfortunately they’re closed ☹️ Their posting says they’re open and now I’ve got to find another place. Kind of disappointed.</Text>

<review>We stumbled onto this small sandwich shop and oh my! I tried the Peruvian Burger that was a very good standard burger with lettuce, tomato and red onion but it was also topped with a fried egg and fried plantains to make it authentic Peruvian. It was OUTSTANDING! The best burger I have had. The caramelized plantains gave the burger a sweetness with a tropical flavor. We also tried the fried yucca, it was bland by itself but when dipped in an accompanying green spicy sauce it was pretty good as a fry alternative. We also tried the fried rice which was excellent. There were other very good sandwiches to include a very delicious steak sandwich that also came topped with a fried egg.< /review>< Rate>

Terrible takeout experience. Waited 30 minutes, even saw another customer who came after me finish his meal and leave. Then, when I checked in on the food, they cooked the wrong order and didn’t remember what I ordered and had to start over again. Truly terrible service.<//Review>

<user_name>Vargasa</user_name><review>This is a little place with big flavor. While  unfortunately the place is run down (I suggest ordering for takeaway) however we roughed it out and ate there (not the worst since fortunately we are soccer fans)

Now to the food, two sandwiches: Lomo asado and chicharron the Lomo asado was delicious the meat was tasty and the grilled peppers went well with the meat.

The chicharron takes the cake on this one as the meat is greasy unhealthy and very succulent. The lime adds the perfect zing and its enjoyable all the way through ( don't ignore the sauce they give out with the sandwich)</review><time>1515651658160< /time></record></dataset><record>

I was shopping in the area and was looking for something to eat. Since I love Peruvian food I thought I would give this place a try.  The food was pretty good, how ever the service was a little slow. it took us about 35 minutes to get our food. This is a very small place so I think it more of a take out place. you should probably call in an order before getting there.<//text>

Best plantains I've had in a long time.  Right balance of sweet and tart, fried to a perfect crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. Great sandwich (bread was wow!) and yuca as well.  Here on business and so glad I tried something I can't get at home.< /Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>Check your receipts because they will charge you more for a Peruvian drink with the lunch combo special. Lady at the front cashier gave me false information and on top ,attitude. I asked her before I was paying if I can get any drink and she said yes, then I checked my receipt  and she had charged me extra,  than what was said. Then after I paid and asked her  she told me it was only for any coke beverages , when I specifically asked before if I could get the maracuya the Peruvian drink. Horrible service and not coming back at all . Definitely not recommending any of my friends and family to come here and giving them business. Really upsetting...
on top of that the sand-which was super greasy.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

I like this place, but FYI they are currently closed for renovations. May want to call ahead so you don't show up like I just did. The columbian place next door is a good alternative though if you do.<//text>

< Review>
my husband and I decided to eat at this place we ordered sandwiches and a tamal which we were specting a delicious meal.  I said chicken our waitress served (pork) our food was served cold the bread was old and none of the products were fresh my sandwich (had ratten onions) and it looked like the cook just throw everything into the bread everything was misplaced I was very disappointed we decided to tell them to exchange our food,  we waited for my husband sandwich to be make when the waitress literally served another sandwich without even noticing or checking what she was serving.  My husband was this close to eat another sandwich with a (nail) . I was very disappointed and decided to tell her what was on the plate (again)  and she accused me of putting the nail on the plate..my husband ask her for our money back she refused to give us our money. I went to their other locations and their refused as well. I believe food shouldn't be served like that. Owners should put more attention to their business. Definitely not coming back"<//Review>

I'm not sure when their busiest the most, but you probably want to call in your order instead, and take it home. Another option would be to take it with you to any of the local breweries and enjoy a nice cold beer with it, which is what I plan to do next time I visit. The dining area is maybe 6 feet by 10 feet at the most!! I think I counted 15 seats total. Lucky for my wife and I, we were able to sit down, enjoy our food, and watch a little preseason NFL in español.

I ordered the Pan Con Chicharrón and my wife ordered the Lomo Saltado plate. My "sandwich" was good, nothing out of the norm. It came with sweet potatoes and criolla. The meat was a little dry, but that's what you get with chicharron. Normally I wouldn't have ordered it, but apparently this is the popular sandwich on the menu. It's normally $6 but on Wednesdays it's $5. Some Peruvian places use bolillo bread for their sandwiches, but this place makes their sandwiches using ciabatta bread. It wasn't bad, but the bread makes a big difference. I asked my wife how her lomo saltado was and she responded with "I've had better." Don't get me wrong we still enjoyed the food very much (leftovers were bomb), but unfortunately for Micas, my wife and I have been spoiled to quite a bit of Peruvian places in the Inland Empire and Los Angeles.

Next time I visit Mica's I'm going to try their Jamón Del País sandwich. It was the one I was originally going to try. I look forward to washing it down with a nice cold Inca Kola.< /review>< Rate>

It's a small Peruvian place. They're known for their lomo saltado and yuca fries. There's limited seating but it feels really homey.< /text>

(Translated by Google) This place is useless, 45 minutes waiting for my food sitting down, nor water they gave us, the owners have a bad scheme, they make the To go food first, with a single cook, so they go to failure, how much can a cook earn per hour So that they hire a chef on a busy hour, $ 15 per hour is a lot of money for the owner ???

(Original)
Este lugar no sirve para nada,45 minutos esperando mi comida sentado,ni agua nos dieron,los dueños tienen un mal esquema,hacen primero la comida To go,  con un solo cocinero,así van al fracaso, cuanto puede ganar un cocinero por hora para que contraten en hora ocupada a un cocinero, 15 dólares por hora es mucho dinero para el dueño???< /Text>

Comfortable, quaint stay in a great location. My only complaint is that the walls are very thin, so we could hear everything going on in the room above us (super loud footsteps). Try asking for an upstairs room so you don’t have this issue!< /Review>

The Grove Inn is in a residential neighborhood and a good location. We had room 17, second floor, deluxe queen with bay windows. Not a spacious room but sufficient for our needs. I was having surgery at UCSF. Husband stayed 2 nights.  It was very clean, had been remodeled and deluxe bedding which was very comfortable for a good nights sleep.  Nice clean hot shower with new upgraded fixtures. About 10 pm a firetruck and some noisy cars came by and I thought it may be too noisy for me but after that, everything went quiet for the evening.  We felt very safe and saw no homeless on the streets close by. There was no alarm clock in the room therefore using my cell phone for that. Also because of covid, there was no breakfast service and they have a no contact checkin. We did not turn on the tv. There was a nice floor fan with several settings on it which we didn't need. The hosts were very accomodating and very pleasant to talk to on the phone. Even willing to switch our accomodations for a room with 2 beds had we needed it without add. charges. That was very kind of them. We would definitely stay here again. For us, location, safety, cleanliness, upgraded bedding, noise and parking fees were all factors in our decision to stay here. They did not disappoint.<//Review>

I'm so glad we came across The Grove Inn! On our check-in day, we arrived early. The room wasn't available yet, but we were able to store our bags and one of the Inn attendants gave us restaurant and coffee shop recommendations.

We stayed in one of the upstairs rooms facing the street and it was very comfortable! The place has a unique "old house" feel to it, which was very cool. For breakfast, there was coffee, tea, orange juice, fresh bread from a local bakery, as well as other assorted breakfast items (cereal, oatmeal, etc.).

Between the friendliness of the staff, the charm of the building, and the convenience of the location (walking distance to Alamo Square, many restaurants, and Civic Center Plaza), this is undoubtedly a place to which I'll be returning.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2i7y8qOgF52luvVjyHhp2DDxowxRJ85NNwL71=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgLSlMpOh2lwgUjv-9CaEYrG5iCUhc3Dudi4Lu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

Had such a great stay here.  Love the location right behind the Painted Ladies.  Check-in/out was contactless due to Covid, but the communication and instructions was great.  Loved the room, clean and spacious.  I will be coming back to stay here.</Review>

Staff was very helpful. Continental breakfast was good. Hotel Location was great! 1 block from Alamo Square Park (awesome view of the city) & Painted Ladies houses. Easy busing (right on bus #22 line & 2 blocks from #5 line) very secure hotel & nice neighborhood. Excellent seafood (mom & pop) restaurant across the street.< /review>

This is a nice place for an overnight stay.  It is located in a mostly residential area, but it is noisy in the morning.  Also, finding parking can be tricky if you have a car.<//review>

No hotel is perfect, but this is my favorite one when I travel to San Francisco. It's very quiet (both the hotel and the neighborhood) but still close enough to good restaurants and cafés. The rooms are a decent size and the bed was far more comfortable than most hotels. The free continental breakfast and  was great as well. Free/fast wifi, newspapers each morning, in-room Keurig...what's not to like?<//Text>

<Review>The place smell like old urine the carpet smell bad from the front door all the way to the room I’m was disgusted to see that they have a rate of 8.8 On our arrival we were told that our room was being repaired and the receptionist was sorry and ask us to go for a walk and comeback in 2 hours that really made me angry we supposed to check in a day before but missed our flight in NY and we turned out one after and this man has the gut to excused for the inconveniences that the room as to be fixed , also the lady who was there as a receptionist or housekeeper her name is Anna she’s rude, racist and unprofessional she has no respect for their customers, doesn’t greet people and when addressing to you she doesn’t even the politeness to look at you, the bed linen are badly were off not iron look like it came out of the mouth of pigs , their breakfast it disgusting cheapest food that I cannot even feed my pet. Expedia you need to check out all the place and accommodations that you have in contract before advertising on your website.   I felt like you rubbed my money . The place need a renovation specially the flooring, there were no fridge in the room, the kettle it so small like a toy can only give one mug of tea at a time, no sink within the toilet you have to come out to the corridor to wash your hands . Big shame for you Expedia and the accommodation< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Quiet quaint Victorian, helpful staff, unique room, was once a house I believe.  Only dislike was no safe for valuables and inability to adjust temperature in room besides windows.  Was a bit chilly at times, never too warm.  They at least searched for a heater for me but didn’t find one.  They did provide me a bar fridge however when I requested it, no charge.  Pleasant quiet stay</Text>

Sweet Inn in a residencial area of San Francisco. The rooms are small but refurbished and comfortable. The morning coffee is good and the crossants are delicious. My only suggestion, make a bigger sign for your Inn. My cab almost missed the front door.</Review>

<Date>1564712904699</Date><rating>1<//rating><review>I planned to stay at the Grove Inn for two nights in July. We checked in late afternoon and everything seemed fine until it’s time to go to bed and we found a spider between our pillows. It was around 11pm at this point and front desk had left and there was not an emergency number that we could call. So we left the hotel and found another lodging arrangement. It is not reasonable to expect guests to stay in a room with bugs. We emailed the hotel immediately, with pictures, and time stamp, as well but did not get a response until the next morning. I have been trying to get a refund since but they claimed I stayed over the first night. We did not stay over the first night. I’d have loved to settle this between the hotel and myself but the Hotel is not cooperating. I also called Expedia, their 3rd party company handling reservation but Expedia would need their OK to process a refund. I don’t think it is fair to expect anybody to sleep in such condition. I don’t recommend you staying here at all for your own convenience.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Grove Inn was a great place to stay as it had a bus stop right outside the front door. It was also a nice stroll downhill into Union Square. The rooms were very comfortable. We had booked for 3 nights but then decided to stay an extra two nights because our experience at the Grove Inn had been fabulous. The continental breakfast also was a great start to your day. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel to everyone.<//text>

<text>The Grove Inn experience was outstanding.  This is such a perfect center of the city location to explore from. Recently reopened after a renovation, The Grove Inn is clean, fresh, and warm & the beds were incredibly comfortable.  Josh & his mother Rosetta could not have been more gracious and accommodating. They gave us great local recommendations, offered an incredible morning artisan breads, freshly squeezed orange juice, wonderful coffee, in a sunny perfect people watching breakfast room & gave us customized directions to our walking destinations that included the best streets & beer gardens to check out.  The design and details of the inn are inspired by Rosetta & the families' Italian heritage. Just lovely. You will love The Grove Inn.<//text>< Pics>

The location is around the corner from the Painted Ladies and within walking distance from several great restaurants and bars (check out Stone Bowl Plus , Wholesome Bakery, and the Noir Lounge).  The rooms were cozy and comfortable, and I loved that I was able to stay with my sister, husband, and toddler in the same space but give my sister a different room.  Wed definitely stay here again!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Cute well placed little inn. Very helpful multi-lingual staff. Rooms are a bit small and parking was a challenge one day (street is free if you can find some). Bed and bath were clean and comfortable. Thanks a bunch to the staff for a great stay.<//Text>

<text>The entire hotel was always kept clean. The property itself was really cool and had a lot of character. Have all the facilities you can expect for such a hotel. Loved the charm of the location and the property. Amazing value for what you pay. We found the rooms rather small.< /text><Time>1499299200000< /Time></record></dataset><record>

I've always been extremely happy with the cleanliness of the hotel. I have dietary restrictions and the staff at the Inn were wonderful about accommodating my diet. The amenities were great in the room. Only a short walk to boutique shops and restaurants. For the price is fit our needs perfectly.</text>

<review>This is a very sweet, but still clean and modern inn.  There is a continental breakfast that is more European than American, reminds me of a lot of breakfasts I had in hostels and hotels in Europe.  The breakfast isnt super impressive, but will be enough to fill you up for a day of sight seeing.  When we arrived, someone showed us our room but mentioned that there was a suite available if we would rather have that.  We were traveling with an infant, so we were thrilled to have the suite with an extra room so that we could still have a light/the tv on after the baby went to sleep.  The only negative was that the inn did not have any cribs, which was somewhat surprising.  However, luckily I had called ahead to ask about the crib so we were prepared, and rented a pack-n-play from a baby rental service.  But that is the only negative I would say about the inn, so if you dont need a crib, then I would highly recommend.  I loved the area it was in, and actually booked the inn after asking a friend who recently lived in San Francisco where to stay.  This was not a touristy area at all, but felt more like when you stay in an air bnb and are really in a neighborhood where locals hang out and live.<//review>< pictures>

We really enjoyed our stay at the Grove Inn in San Francisco. I have stayed in this area of the city before (Lower Haight) and enjoy it's location being a bit removed from the more touristy parts of the city. The bedroom was very comfortable and the bed linens were extra soft.< /text>

Location is ok but you need to walk 10 minutes to catch a bus into town. On their website they do direct you to a local parking garage a few blocks away. We stayed for a week and we would definitely come back and recommend the Grove Inn to our friends and family.<//text>

The service was eexcellent here. They always welcome you as you come in. The breakfast consisted of yogurt, hard boiled eggs, toast, pastries, orange juice, coffee. The bathrooms looked really nice like they were recently renovated. They had water, coffee, and tea in the room everyday.<//Review>

My family and I had a wonderful experience at this place. The staff was very friendly. Bonna (Ihope I spelled that correct) greeted me and checked me in. She was awesome! She remembered me every time she saw me and would always take the time to chat with me if she could. We were on the first floor and didn’t really notice any noise. Breakfast was delicious and a nice selection. Parking was quite tricky at times. You have to make sure you read the signs. During peak times you could only park for 2 hrs. Overall, the stay was pleasant and I would stay there again. -KT< /Review>

<Text>Amazing stay. So much better than Union Square and Fisherman's wharf! You can have a real taste of San Francisco's life. Nice places in a walking distance, like Hayes Valley, Lower Haights and Fillmore and Divisadero Streets. The rooms are clean and well equiped and the staff is also very nice. They even have a breakfast.<//Text>< Pics>

We had a great experience with The Grove Inn. The room was clean, recently renovated, and exactly what we needed. They even allowed us to leave our luggage in the lobby before and after checkout.<//text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Highly Recommend in SF

+ Cozy~ Breakfast was also provided, and I was able to drink fruit and tea in the evening. The staff were also friendly. And there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel, and Alamo Square is a short walk above the hotel. He also gave me a heater.

-There is no elevator (the staff helped me when moving my luggage). The sink is missing the drip control, but it has not been fixed.

(Original)
Highly Recommend in SF

+ 아늑해요~ 아침식사도 제공됐고, 저녁시간에도  놓인 과일과 차를 마실수 있었습니다. 스텝들도 친절했습니다. 그리고 바로 앞에 버스정류장이 있었고, 호텔 위로 조금만 더 걸어가면 알라모스퀘어 있습니다. 히터도 주셨습니다.

- 엘리베이터가 없다는점( 짐 옮길때 스텝들이 도와주셨습니다). 세면대에 물빠짐 조절하는 게 빠져있는데, 고쳐져 있지 않았습니다.</Review>

Hôtel très bien situé proche des quartiers à découvrir. Le personnel est très accueillant, serviable et disponible. La chambre au rdc donnant sur une rue desservie par le bus est certes un peu bruyante mais les boules kies sont fournies. Chambre petite, vétuste, mais propre. Le petit déjeuner est super.Je recommande cet hôtel familial pour ceux qui fuient les usines à dormir.<//Review>

Tolles Hotel in sehr guter Lage mit sehr freundlichen und zuvorkommenden (auch deutschsprachigen) Mitarbeitern. Sehr liebevoll eingerichtetes und sehr gepflegtes Haus. Die Betten sind sehr gut. Direkt auf der anderen Straßenseite des Hotels ist ein schönes, gutes Restaurant.  Parken ist in der Nähe des Hotels in einem Parkhaus möglich. Wir würden jederzeit wieder dieses tolle Hotel in dieser wunderschönen Stadt buchen. Herzlichen Dank für diesen schönen Aufenthalt.< /review>

(Translated by Google) The hotel with poor sound insulation is not worth it. It is definitely not recommended. I live in the No. 10 room on the second floor. I can hear the conversation in Room 11, especially after 11pm, although the hotel has The quiet time period is 10pm~8am, but the reception is off work at 10 o'clock in the evening. There is no enforcement. It was because I was looking for a quiet hotel, but it was so bad. I definitely don't recommend it.

(Original)
隔音很差的飯店，不值得，絕對不推薦，我住在這家的十號房位在二樓，都可以聽到11號房間的對話內容，特別是晚上11點後還很吵，雖然飯店有規定quiet 時段是10pm~8am ，但是reception晚上十點就下班，沒有強制執行，當初是因為要找安靜的飯店，但是卻是這樣的爛，我絕對不推薦</review>

Familiäres, kleines, Hoteljuwel in der Nähe der Innenstadt. Mit den Buslinien 21 und 22 ist man Ruck Zuck überall. Wir waren mit zwei kleinen Kindern im Grove Inn und hatten die King Suite mit zwei Schlafzimmern. Uns hat es sehr gut gefallen, es war ruhig, es gab das tollste Frühstück während unseres USA Aufenthaltes und die Besitzer/das Personal sind extrem nett und hilfsbereit.< /review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The excellent breakfast, the cleanliness, the availability of the staff, the silence and the tranquility of the structure, the convenience of the bus stops. In the room you will find tea and coffee. To reach the bed and breakfast from the Oakland Airport: take the free shuttle-funicular that connects to the underground system (bart). The blue line or green leading to San Francisco at the Embarcadero Station: Here you change to the city's subway (called muni) dropping to Church Station, then bus No. 22 to Fillmore and Marina, descending junction with Grove Street. Get coins or dollars counted for the ticket you take from the driver. Alternatively you can immediately buy the MUNI prepaid card from the metro stations. On McAllister Street passes the bus n ° 5, leading to the Golden Gate Park or Union Square.

La colazione ottima, la pulizia, la disponibilità del personale, il silenzio e la tranquillità della struttura, la comodità delle fermate dell'autobus. In camera troverete tè e caffè. Per raggiungere il bed and breakfast dall'aeroporto di Oakland: si prende la navetta-funicolare gratuita che collega alla rete metropolitana (bart). La linea blu o verde che porta a San Francisco alla stazione Embarcadero: qui si cambia per la metropolitana cittadina (chiamata muni) scendendo a Church Station, poi l'autobus n° 22 per Fillmore o Marina, scendendo all'incrocio con Grove street. Preparatevi delle monete o dollari contati per il biglietto che si prende dall'autista. In alternativa potete subito comprare la carta prepagata MUNI dalle stazioni metro.

(Translated by Google) Superb guest room in San Francisco. Very well located the only downside is the lack of parking space you have to move your car every two hours if you do not want to PV. Other than that very good even for a couple with two kids like us. Very nice breakfast with croissant fruit juice cheese we almost forget that we are in the United States.

(Original)
Superbe chambre d'hôtes à San Francisco. Très bien situé le seul bémol c'est l'absence de place de parking il faut bouger sa voiture toutes les deux heures si on ne veut pas de PV. À part ça très bien même pour un couple avec deux enfants comme nous. Petit-déjeuner très sympa avec croissant jus de fruit fromage on en oublierait presque que l'on est aux États-Unis.< /Review>

<Review>When we checked inn the lady offered us her parking spot as she was just leaving. This was very helpful as parking is a bit difficult in that area.Only the room are a bit old (even though the bathrooms are updated).If they would invest in room doors which are really closing (and not leaving a gap) it would be one star more in the evaluation from my side.Overall it was nice and we would stay there again.< /Review>< name>

< Review>
This father and son team were extremely professional and friendly. I had just replaced the battery and not all my sensors were activated properly. Tim told me to drive it on the freeway for 30 to 40 minutes and bring it back. I did and that fixed the problem.
Thanks for your professionalism. .< /Review>

<text>I wish I found this place years ago, dude dropped everything he was doing to open the shop back up to get me on my way. Highest level of professionalism, first priority friendliness, a care for your car like you wish the dealer had, and at a price that you can't beat. 100% will recommend 100% will return< /text>< pictures>

<review>The shop owner is very friendly, social, accommodating, polite, and tries his best to make to make you feel at home. Good price, great service, and time efficient. Wish there were SMOG businesses with a friendly sense.. five stars. I have used this SMOG shop a couple of times now.
Highly recommend this shop.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80ea6a9b4105e8af:0xc332769e4b7b867d< /GmapID></record>

Great customer service. It was late and  I needed a smog check right away well the owner said bring in your vehicle and will get it done.  It was after hours and he waited for me and didn't make me feel like I had to rush. I was In and out in less than 7 minutes. Great place when you're in a hurry</review>

I brought my vehicle to ADI, my check engine had came on prior to this, I had done some work to my car, the check engine had been cleared, however, I was worried that the check engine light would come back on during the smog test, and I would fail the test, then be out the money... I explained this to ADI, he was kind enough to do a pre-diagonostic test, allowing me to know ahead of time if I would pass or not, mind you, he never asked for any money, without a charge of any sort.  I would have failed the test,  then be out the $58... I really appreciated ADI's honesty and genuine kindness, and on top of that he offered me some cookies upon my departure from his shop. I would recommend ADI to anyone that may be skeptical of other smog businesses in town!!!< /Text>

< review>
I moved out here from Arizona and had to get my car smogged to register it in California.  My husband and I found ADI smog through google and it was one of only two shops in the area open past 5 and ADI smog was the only one open until 6.  We stopped by closer to 6 and weren’t turned away. The process was quick and the service was friendly.

Friendly fast service, a good price, and flexibility is what we experienced.  My husband took the car to the dmv the next day and had it registered.  We will come here again.<//review>

Worst place to get a car wash. Given the fact that my car looked worse then it looked like before I went into the car wash. I highly recommend going elsewhere.<//Text>

I accidentally left with the nozzle attached. No damage, but I was charged with a $180 'drive off' fee. The bill of course was not itemized--just a flat fee.

I was presented with a different touchpad for the payment, which reinforced my feeling that something shady was going on.</Text>

As I mentioned when we spoke, this is a relatively low amount as far as these repairs go.\n\nAs for the matter of the separate touchpad, I had to charge you for the drive off separately as it isn’t a product/service and you wanted to take care of payment yourself instead of going through your insurance company which is usually the standard procedure.\n\nOnce again, your satisfaction is my priority and is worth far more to us than some fee. I urge you to reach out to me so I can put your mind at ease and reassure you that you were charged the correct amount and that it is consistent with similar repairs.'}<//resp>

<Review>Came here for the first time to pick up my Pad Kee Mao aka Drunken noodles. Apparently when I called to place my order, their other restaurant in Tustin got to my call instead. Please check location when you call, just in case. We were able to clear the confusion and they went ahead to work on my order.

It was definitely worth the wait because I had the BEST drunken noodles I've ever had! Hands down. I ordered the vegetarian version with steamed tofu.  It was just the right amount of heat from the chili (please note that I have a very high tolerance level for spice and I give this a 8/10 for its heat). I am going to dream about this bowl of perfection tonight.  I look forward to trying more of their authentic dishes soon! Thank you for your good service and delicious food.  I'm glad I found this place.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOz5n-H4UBNklvVoBnzoQjEWzngpdfE9gXLKg0x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnVRdqrxg9GVQyjofdZwSVaHnN9xP4nC-iHziQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dd2aae9cd04ec3:0xf76893bc3307e29</Gmap_id></record>

Good Thai food.  They have an actual Thai chef so that's nice and they're adding an entire Thai dessert section. Looking forward to the dessert additions.<//Text>

I adore this restaurant! They give good meals, their menu is nice, The cook in that restaurant is a specialist, I love a lot tasting all their dishes. The dishes are consistently fresh, the attitude towards the clients  is helpful. I  go often to this place and I not even once was unsatisfied. I recommend it with no hesitation.<//text>

Nice staff, great Tom Yum.

The actual restaurant has this interesting older character feel to it. I dont feel like I'm in La Habra when I'm inside. It feels more quaint urban. Like older New York.

If you're ordering online and you've put anything in the "comment" section to add requests (like asking for chopsticks or spices) make sure you double check in person when you arrive because I dont think they read that part; several occasions didn't receive those things. Just an FYI- still a great place to eat!!< /text>

<review>Had food from this restaurant for the first time. Ordered a take out.
The food was really good. Very flavorful. The Panang curry was very good. We ordered Orange Chicken. And it was awesome. We thought it would be like Panda Express. But it was different and it tasted very good. My kids loved it. It came with a Orange dipping sauce.
I would definitely recommend. Will definitely try it again with different dishes.
Also the person taking the call and taking care of the customers was very grateful pleasant and courteous. I heard her talk to others on the phone and she was very respectful and nice.<//review><Resp>None</Resp><Pics>None<//Pics><Time>1613364323933< /Time></record>

We had an extraordinary time in this place. We liked the first-rate environment and the meals. The staff were very amiable. I am glad we ultimately decided to visit this spot.< /review>

Over all the food tasted good but I would expect rice with my curry. The food is over priced for not serving rice. I spend $60 for food for 4 and we're still hungry. If you want good Thai food, I would suggest you go to Thai Lady in La mirada.<//Text>

<text>Thai town located along the dust stained harbour blvd in La Habra is a great introduction to distinctive cuisine with spiciness and well flavoured curried served in small plates. The menu, a simple one offers exotic dishes like the red curry, the green curry and the yellow curry. The prices are relatively cheap. While my colleague settled for a crab fried rice, I nestled for the red curry with pork. The taste was exquisite. The spiciness was medium and all vegetables mixed in the curry was tender, crispy and fresh.< /text>< username>

Very good place for Thai in La Habra. The food was fresh and very tasty! The price is right and the service was awesome. The waitress was very attentive and made sure we were well taken care of. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a fresh vegan option.< /Review>

Great food and great service! The lady who took my order was genuine, as was the food. Generous portions for a good price and great quality.
Oh and they don’t serve beer, but she welcomed me to grab one next door at the liquor store. When I got back she had a beer glass ready for me. It’s the little things :’)</text>

Got food to go. Place looked rough, like it hasn’t been taken care of in months. We got our food to go, asked for rare beef and this is what I got.... a mess of raw uncooked beef. Also got the masaman curry and the potatoes were green. Flavor was there though. I seriously recommend you do not eat here, I feel like I’m gonna get food poisoning 🤢<//Text>

Over an hour late with the grubhub delivery. Grub hub says the restraunt are the ones to deliver. Still hasnt gotten here and its less than 5 miles away. Completely not acceptable imo. Dont order food from here. Hope the foods not cold and gross when it finally gets here....if it does. Hope they didnt steal our money. . . .  :/</Review>

I love this place! Dine in or takeout - their service is great. With the exception of a few times, the food is great and prices very reasonable. Especially the dinner special. I highly recommend the curries - red is my favorite with a perfect blend of sweet and spice.  I also love spicy basil and my new current favorite is the spicy noodle (without egg)- very tasty. Their salad is very good too - I recommend the spicy lime dressing.<//Text>

I Love Thai food but what I had here just didn't have the flavor that it should have. Too Americanized no authentic ingredients wish it was because they are close to my house. Don't think I'll be back.</Text>

Craving Tom Yum soup..i googled for a thai place in my work area. This soup was overpowering with lemon and sourness. I understand it is made with lemongrass trust me I love Tom Yum soup. I ordered the large which seemed quite small. I had to order noodles to add to it. In comparison, a normal size bowl of pho or ramen would have matched what I received even after I ordered noodles and added them in myself. 16 bucks total. Unfortunately, the broth was overpowering and lopsided..portion size was small..and Only after getting charged 3 dollars for noodles to add did it adequately fill me. I left some purposely because I just couldn't tame the broth. Service was outstanding so I left a tip. Maybe I chose the wrong dish at a wonderful place I dont know. But 3 stars for the service. I wouldn't order the soup again even if it were 6 dollars.< /text>

Such great flavors! It's a gem of a place hidden away in a small strip making. Nothing fancy as far as decor but the food is the best. Been eating here for about a year now and never had a disappointing meal. Prices are reasonable and the staff is great! I recommend the prik king... One of my favorites!<//review>

I order Tom Yum Kung , Beef curry and then i order fried tofu as well.

I have to wait so long.
They prepare another customer first who come late after me.

After wait morebthan 15 minutes, they give us Tofu curry. Thats it.  Not even my order.

O have to complain, then she give me beef tofu and fied tofu like my order but not tom yum.

I have to complain again and again..

I though that the server is very bad. Or does not understand english or tgai food very well.

I dont think this is a good restaurant.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

I love this place! It's not much to look at, but the food is really good and the staff are super nice (if a bit weird - in a good way). Whenever we go in, one of the waiters always makes it a point to pick out a few magazines that he thinks we will like and brings them over to the table. Weird, but totally endearing. As for the food, I get the pad thai and it is so good. The pineapple fried rice is also great.</text>

Very nice and courteous lady that served us.  But service and food was a bit too slow.   The flavor of food was pretty good but i wouldn't consider it authentic, lacked spice and uses white meat chicken.< /text>

This place is AMAZING! Had a special meal delivered to a friend who had been in a serious accident and they delivered it to her within the hour with a card!! Just what I had asked for! She reported that the food was absolutely delicious! I am so, so thankful for this place! Great people that care and delicious food! What more do you need? :)</Text>

My 1-Star Recommendation: Overall, the food is ok, not too great! I would certainly not recommend going here! This is due to the fact that the quantity of the food offered is too little compared to the price paid! Also, the customer service was very, very slow and it took quite a long time for our food to arrive at the table.</Review>

Lunch specials ($6.95) gave large Pad Thai entrée portions with a Tom Yum like soup, fried rice and fried potato dumpling. No wait. Quick service.</Text>

I tried this tonight on a groupon and it was pretty good. The staff were great and the food was tasty, although the soup was much too thin for a tom-kha I thought.<//text>

Not the greatest. Actually probably below average. The prices are about 20% higher than other thai places just over the hill on fullerton rd. The portions aren't too big, and the taste is mediocre. The BBQ chicken was over cooked so it was like jerky<//review>

Good prices and we'll maintained. Only drawback is no credit card readers. Probably helps keep the price low though so not a big issue!< /review>

The layout means that the stalls are open and not protected from each other and on most days the vacuum/drying station is down wind from the washing station so be prepared to get overspray.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Decent car wash place. Their foam brushes are too soft to get a really deep scrub for tough dried-on spots. Also, the suction of their vacuums could be better. I couldn't fit the vacuum head in the space between my seat and the door so that is still dirty. Unless you are a perfectionist, this is overall, a good spot though! 👍🏾<//Text>

It is average that could slide into below average. Soap is watered down. Small area for a big truck but truck will fit. Timers seem a little quicker than should be. Does in a pinch but not a regular go-to.</Review>

<Text>This is the closest car wash to my house which is the primary reason I go. For the most part it is like any old car wash, but for some reason the people that bring their cars here spend a lot of time cleaning them, which en encourages me to do the same. I really wish they took credit/debit cards!< /Text>< pictures>

Decent coin operated car wash. Usually a line here, as there are only four bays and a lot of people take their time. Since I'm only ever rinsing off my bike I'm usually in and out pretty quickly.<//Text>

For the most part it's exactly what it's suppose to be, a self-cleaning car wash. The only thing that makes no sense is that it wants you to buy coins to use anything. And if you don't want anything that you just got, then you can't get your coin back. This place only takes cash no coins so I guess stop at a store or a bank before you get here.<//text>

Easy and relatively affordable.  I wish they accepted some kind of payment other than their proprietary "Gold Coins."  If you don't have cash or leftover coins from a previous visit, you can't use the facility.</Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I like the car wash because it has a lot of spaces for cars but they have to be very careful because a lot of homeless people arrive

<Text>I went to get 4 tires installed and they said they were going to charge me $160, which I thought was a lot but I needed the tires mounted. It took them about 15 which was very nice and so I went and paid them, once I get in my car and start reversing the car won’t move, so I look under and I see that the 2 front wheels were touching the calipers which to be fair that was on me, but what surprised me was that when they mounted the 2 front tires they didn’t see that the calipers were touching. So I asked the younger mechanic if it would be possible to put the 2 front old rims back on the truck so that I am able to back it out of the shop, and he says sure that will be $60! I was so shocked that they were charging me once again for a mistake that they did. I told him that it was unacceptable for charging me that much and he told me that he will do $40 without balancing the wheels, I was very disappointed because I’ve always came here to change my tires and tony as always been so nice and good at doing is job. At the end I was charged $200 for putting 4 tires on a car... I will not return to this location.</Text>< response>

I've been coming here for a few years now.  I love the fact that it's a small family run operation and not a big corporate store that tries to upsell you everything under the sun.  I like to support the small business' in the area as we are losing them all so fast which is really sad.  Tony and his crew/family are always fast and his prices are super reasonable.  No fancy waiting room but you're not there for long so who cares?  I've gotten some really great used tires here for cheap over the years.

They took care of my latest mishap (see pic) in 10 minutes and it was $15!  Highly recommend!</text>

<Text>I bought new tires recently and they did not balance it well. When I went back to get them checked they were rude  and didn’t want to do it. Even though I was friendly about it they told me to not come back. I had to go somewhere else to get them fixed. His argument was that if he fixed mine he would have to fix every one else’s.</Text><name>Elmer S< /name>< time>

Every where else I whent they told me that I needed 4 new tires and a alignment. I went in and with one look they side I didn't need a alignment all I needed was tires. And they have a really good selection of use-new tires there fast and more than half the price I would have paid anywhere else.<//text>

< Review>
First time going here for tire service.  I called ahead confirmed the price for what I was looking for.  Phone service was great.  When I got there about 30 minutes later Christian (the sales person) took my car replaced the tire and it was all done graciously, quietly and efficiently.  The price was exactly what he said it would be.  No additional fees, taxes, etc.  I would recommend this company.  If you go to there I hope you have as great an experience that I did, it’s always different for different people.

Good Luck!<//Review>

<GmapID>0x80859a5df22fa031:0x5609a955003bb3cb</GmapID><Review>Very quick tire replacement on demand (your specific tire has to be in stock of course) and their price was excellent. They even gave me free tire rotations every 6 months, which I didn't even request. Depending on how long the brand of tire they use lasts I will be bringing my cars here 10 times out of 10.

Quick and Easy, was in and out in 10 minutes. I got some used tires with about 90% tread on them. Almost brand new for a great price.</text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because I did not try the Chinese Food.

But the chicken? Oh my.  I have tasted Fried Chicken at a whole bunch of places including popular chains and also mom's and pops. This is arguably the tastiest chicken I have ever tasted. Crunchy.  Spicy (not too spicy, just enough to be tasty).  Fresh.  I ordered the 20 piece meal and it also came with rolls and french fries - both were also fresh and delicious.

I also tried the Fish.  The ones I ordered looked like chicken strips but they were fish and they were just as delicious.

On my next trip I am going to try more fish and also the shrimp.

I definitely recommend this place for the Fried Chicken!</review>< Pics>

If I was able to put less than a star then I would. The lady behind the counter with the horrible tan had the worst attitude ever!!! She kept sighing, rolling her eyes and she kept saying that she doesn't have time for us. All my brother said was if they have the number 5 and the lady just said I don't have time for that. I stood quiet thinking "is this MF or real?" There was nobody else in line but us.<//review>

<review>I came and asked for a wing combo. I asked specifically if it was fresh and the girl said oh yeah he just dropped them...I call b.s. The wings were not fresh like I asked, also small and something was just flat off on the taste. I know how chicken from this brand should taste especially when done fresh as requested. My experience was not a good one the first time round but I will be going back and making sure it's done like I asked. I wrote this review so hopefully they catch wind of their mistakes and do this again to anyone else. Enjoy folks but pay attention and get what you pay for.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

This place is the best place for Louisiana Chicken, and they make it fresh to order!!! 15 minute wait. Taste better than the ORIGINAL in L.A.</Review>

<text>The service is good, they have a curve pickup. Unfortunately, inside the store is hard to get help. That's usually in almost any Michael's store. I gave it 4 stars because this time I was able to find someone to help me out in 10 minutes.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808f7bf24c63359d:0xc62b015d0aaf14c6<//gmapID></record>

<Text>Typical of what you’d expect for a Michael’s, no real surprises other than in a time where we are all supposed to be social distancing I found the aisles to feel extra small and there were no floor markings for the check out line and others don’t know how far 6’ is still apparently. Maybe they need one way aisles like other stores have done</Text>< Time>

Your average Michaels had a few cool things not much on lights the best Michaels to go to are the one by Hillsdale and the one on Woodside what I'm Woodside for lights small light pictures or string lights or twisted bubble lights purple and blue pretty awesome lots of pens and clay you want to Hillsdale it's got a nice variety of everything as well</review>

They have a wide range of selections typically but due to all yarn buy one get one 50%, the stock was a bit low. Their stock doesnt seem to change much but I did notice they no longer seem to stock Mandala yarn. It seems to have been replaced with Caron Skinny Cakes.

Register staff is always nice. They are pretty fast too. But it is hard to find an employee if you need help in the store.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>The staff here was very friendly and the store was extremely clean and organized. I attended the teachers workshop and was pleased with my experience. I would suggest though, that the person who leads the class know more about how to do the project. In this case it was fine because it was a simple project and I was familiar with the process already. But others might find it frustrating.< /Text>< Pictures>

The folks working here are fantastic, the store is clean and we'll organized, but they need more folks! Michael's corporate offices need to find like 2 more people to wander the aisles and help dummies like me find stuff.< /review>

Compared to most Michaels this one is actually pretty good. It's not the biggest Michael's I've ever visited or the most comprehensive but it's pretty orderly and easy to navigate and doesn't make me want to die. For a Michaels, this is a RAVE review. Craft away!< /text>

The items I was there for were new releces that weren't there yet, but I could tell they would be there soon because they were shifting stock to make room for new displays in the papercrafts department! This Michaels is in a location with a number of other good retailers and cary-out resturaunts so I also was able to do more stuff while I was there!< /Text>

Most confusing store and company. Simple things, like phone number are not easily available. Items that are part of the same craft are not displayed on the same aisle. Each store has different items, causing me to drive all over to find the item I want.< /review>

I have always loved handmade things - it's the epitome of gift giving and the saying, "it's the thought that counts". As I've gotten older, I have realized my "creative potential", and there is no better place than Michaels to let your imagination go wild. If you're interested in pursuing almost anything craft oriented - from arranging silk flowers to scrap booking to painting and sculpture, Michaels is a great place to get started.< /text>

If you sign up for there newsletter/get the app you will be super excited to get daily coupons/sale deals sent out to you.  It’s rare to not find a good deal, a sale is almost always is happening! Don’t be like me and go close to closing time cause I promise you that you will want more time.< /Review><time>1582541494105< /time><userid>104634128746518793076</userid>< gmap_id>

<review>Does not deserve even one star! Per order instructions, call when you arrive but when you call no one answers and calls gets dropped!  Have a curbside pick up order and it’s confusing as it can be. One lady runs back and forth, no instructions  on what you need to do for them to know you’re waiting for a pick up. Left without my item because their were about 10 cars as confuse as me!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Quick, easy and mostly organized store. The friendly cashier at the check out counter helped by giving me her coupon since mine wouldn’t scan.

Smaller than other Micheal locations but well stocked and good assortment.</Text>

The lines do get long pretty frequently, but otherwise there is always plenty of staff to help you find what you need throughout the store and even if they dont know the answer, they work hard to help you. The store is always clean and organized, everything is easy to find. Their deals are always very visible so you know what you're paying for. And the app lines up very well with the locations of their items. Definitely one of my favorite stores!<//Text>

<review>Good selection of craft items. I came for canvas, brushes and paint. Let with those things as well as a full bag of ornaments for Christmas. They were having a 50% off sale plus and extra 20% of your whole purchase plus a free gift when you spend $50+. Great deals</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiTik9LX0TozyO1yJD0-dy21al0oCnTpfN0oR7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

< Review>
This is a craft and art store. You won't find much by the way of fabric and things. However they have a great selection of art supplies and crafting things. There is also a huge section of yarn. The store is kinda big and there aren't usually many employees around to help. The line is usually really long so if you're in a hurry go early or right before they close.< /Review>

<text>Great store for Arts and Crafts.  Used to buy at this store in Boston, so I am happy to have found this one.  You can find anything raging from ribbons, to painting supplies, to ornament dried plants to straw baskets.

Good selection and they're on top of moving their inventory out so they're ready for every season. Could stand lower process, specially for the of season merchandise. Limited number of staff. The fee that are there are service-oriented. Overall, a good choice for arts and crafts.<//Text>

Lots of fun things to find in this store.   I always find something new I didnt know they had when I am there.  The layout could be better organized so if you are looking for something in particular and cant find it just ask an employee because it might just be in a location elsewhere in the store.  It seems they always have an assortment of coupons available, but read the fine print so you are not surprised or disappointed when you are checking out<//Text>

Be careful when spending your money here. On January 18th I made a purchase and their debit / credit card machine wasn't working. The cashier admitted all their machines were having problems. After a few attempts I paid cash. I asked him to inform the store manager to make this right for future business.  He said the transaction would send me an email receipt but that failed too.  Not a good experience at this Colma store.<//review>

<Review>They had what I want, and despite there being a really really really long line, the wait wasn't that bad. Michael's will continue to top off at 3 stars simply because of their borderline unfair pricing scheme. most things in the store are overpriced then marked down as half off. If you ever pay full price for a frame at Michael's you've been ripped off.< /Review>< Pics>

Always fun to browse and imagine, "what could I do with...", you know? But it feels kinda like a maze. Not sure always where to find stuff. Believe it's kinda organized by vendor so things maybe be in different places< /text>

I vowed "never again" when they dropped the ball on that fly typewriter they distributed but had the precise magnets I needed precisely when I needed them. So I guess that, once they open again after this virus business, they'll be indespensible.< /review>

As Michaels go, this is pretty standard. Aisles are wide and things are well organized. I often very good sales on crafting supplies and notions. There arent any fabric supplies here so for that you will need to go to Joanne's.</Text>

They had what I want, and despite there being a really really really long line, the wait wasn't that bad. Michael's will continue to top off at 3 stars simply because of their borderline unfair pricing scheme. most things in the store are overpriced then marked down as half off. If you ever pay full price for a frame at Michael's you've been ripped off.</Review>

Should avoid on holidays. This visit on Labor Day was a bit of a struggle. The store was very busy and incredibly understaffed.
There was only 1 person on the floor of the store helping customers. And there were not enough cashiers that the checkout line was about 20 customers long.< /Review>

Michael's is a good craft store, but they have really downsized their yarn offerings over the years. I crochet and knit, so I find this irritating. But I guess they have to go with the trends of scrapbooking and flower arrangements. They still have some of the nicest custom framing options, though.</review>

<Review>Friendly and helpful employees, great selection of art supplies and decor. The back on the left side though, near all the flowers, is just FULL of boxes and stock and you can get anywhere near there. Might as well just make it a storage room. I know that's not particularly anyone's fault and will probably be fixed with time but it is a lot of trouble and makes the store look messy and disorganized. Might as well just make that back a stock room.< /Review><UserId.>101690824869344060732<//UserId.><Response>None</Response>< username>

<review>Huge arts and crafts store with art framing department as well.  They offer good coupons on their website or in their ads.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  Usually, if there is a long line at the checkout counters, it goes quite quickly.  They also offer classes and private parties in their classroom.

Sometimes you have to look in different departments to see the whole selection of what they have because they don't always group like items together.  For example, I was looking for small paint brushes and found them in over 3 different aisles in the painting section then found more in the children's craft aisles as well.  Then I found more paint brushes on a couple different end-caps (at end of aisle).</review>< pics>

I didn't find everything that I needed, but the line was so long that I couldn't take the time to investigate. Management was on the floor and behind the register and they instituted their express checkout to make things easier (that was the first I'd seen it and it was helpful in moving things along). It's a good store, but quite hectic around the holidays of course!<//Text>

<Text>I wish I could make two different comments.   Five stars for the framing department -- so creative, efficient and reasonable.  Two stars for front checkout.  I wanted to make some other purchases, but when I got in line there was one clerk and seventeen customers.   Come on!   I bailed.< /Text>< rating>

<rating>1< /rating><review>Very rude people, the prices on top of items are different once you pay... and even though is their fault.. won't give you the price... so you loose your time and excitement of planning something nice with that sale, and you have to leave empty handed, cause the price is twice as much or even more.. 1st and 2nd time I was okay, you know everyone makes mistakes,  but this time I was mad, I feel they do it unporpose to get you buy it.. 🤨< /review>< pictures>

Good enough place even if their prices can be tricky at times. Got classes on stuff. Got pro framers..to help package your pieces of art. Like the out door mall close to key items i like plus target and two framing specialties shops that 80 or more % just art picture framing.< /review>

My goodness they need to staff better. Three checkers and a line at least 30 people long. Instead of putting the extra associates in the register they had one of them go down the line scanning items and giving customers a card to take to the front. I saw more workers on the floor then at the registers. As someone who used to work at a Michael's I can say it is a poorly managed location. I understand that corporations limit the amount of people a store can have on shift, but that really wasn't the problem here.< /review>

I LOVE Michaels as a whole, they have such a great assortment of craft supplies. And amazing coupons all the time if you join their mailing list. This Michaels isn't the best though, its been very picked over and very crowded in the parking lot on many occasions. Fortunately it's next door to Target which is convenient, if it's not in one, it's probably in the other. And if not either of those... I just take myself over to the nearby Bevmo to calm myself down from battling the crowds.<//review>

I love going to Michaels for all my craft/arts needs. The store layout is a bit confusing though and there are areas that look like it has been ransacked and could use some tidying up.</Review>

Enormous, bright, clean, friendly, Wide variety of craft items. The staff are very helpful which is good because similar items can be found in several different places in the store, though they're not always familiar with the product you need. Stock doesn't remain constant. They always have coupons and sales going, thought!< /Review>

<text>I ordered 3 packs of canvases online for on store pick up. They smell like mold. The smell is so strong that it gives me a gigantic headache. I put them outside in the patio which is vented yet has windows and a door so there's ventilation. But the smell is so strong that I could smell them uo stairs as though they were sitting right next to me.  Then when I purchase some additional items at the register the cashier either accidentally (??idk) kept my Joanne's fabric bags.  Maybe it was a mistake maybe it was taking the competitors bags off of the streets as I've known companies to do, I don't know. Her attitude was so flipid and I don't careish that I couldn't tell what was what with her. But I was extremely disappointed in my service in the store and the products once I got them home. Disgusted actually by the canvases stinky stinky odor.</text><name>Claudine Forsythe<//name>< Pictures>

I definitely have mixed feelings about this Michaels. It's a nice store that's clean and organized and stuff is generally friendly. However, trying to get any kind of help by calling them it's pretty much impossible. I called them asking if they had something in stock so that I didn't have to drive 5 miles in case they didn't. I was on hold twice for more than 20 minutes. I told him exactly what I was looking for and the exact location. The only thing I didn't have is the aisle number. Yeah they couldn't tell me if it was or was not in stock. Ended up just driving over there just to discover of course, they were out of stock.< /text>

I was able to find 100 pc Wilton Cookie Cutter set for preschool projects.  Product was advertised by chain store and their on-line store.  Disappointed after trip to three different store locations and attempting to order on-line neither store or on-line had product availability. Thanks Michael's< /text>

Service can be slow at times depending on your visit here and hours that you visit. But they literally have everything you need to make stuff with. They even carry Iwata Airbrush kits! IWATA!

They also carry a lot of paint supplies and craft supplies for your children's next project so that helps too. Parking is relatively easy, and there's a BevMo a few stores down if you also need to hoard and stash more liquor.

Me and my girlfriend went here like 3 times in a week for supplies and they always have what you need.</review>

Absolutely massive store. Almost always a worker greeting at the door and available for questions. It can get busy during commute hours and this culminates in messy aisles and long lines, but the selection makes up for it.< /Review>

The Cupertino Michael's appears busier but also retains their seasonal items longer. The San Mateo location is pretty big and very well stocked. Staff at this Daly City one are very friendly and sweet. If you're looking post-holiday bargain finds, this one is decent, but there are better Michael's locations in the Bay.< /review><userid>101846724542783849524</userid></record>

This is the second worst Michaels I have ever been to. I can never find anything because the center of their store is a scrapbooking labyrinth. Want to look at the stickers? Good luck, they're on multiple aisles, just like everything else, spread out all over the place. Why is Martha Stewart a section? That's not a product genre, it's a brand. Cripes. How hard is it to make regular aisles? All the other Michaels do it. I feel more likely to run into a minotaur than come across an item on my shopping list in that Colma location.< /review>

< Review>
This Michael's location in Serramonte shopping center is fun to shop. The store has it's standard picture frames and custom matting but what I found helpful is the clearance sections. The prices in the clearance section are discounted sometimes under 50%. The store also has a nice selection of crafts such as jewelery making, painting and silk screen.
The store seems to consistently have sales or online coupons.
The parking lot is shared between Target, BevMo, and Black Bear.<//Review>

<text>Very mediocre as far as Michaels goes. I'm not sure why, but no matter what time I go, there is always a wait at the checkout. The store can sometimes be disorganized and it's difficult to find someone if you need assistance. Easy to find parking in the lot out front.</text></record></dataset><record>

ordered online to be sent in the Colma store, got a message saying item is ready to be picked up, got an email saying "you only have 2 days to pick up the item." went to the store and was told the item is not ready and will get call when the item is ready to be picked up, wait what?, well no more ordering online and picking up in the store, what use is that service, also just take out the item online if it's not available to begin with</text>

<Text>The store is clean and well stocked, but very understaffed.  I called and was placed on hold and then hung up on three times while trying to find if they had an item in stock.  The employee tried to shoo me off the phone when I finally did get through, because they "are all very busy".  I told him that I was looking to verify that they had an item before I drove there and wasted an hour of my day.  He checked and said that they did.  When I went there it took me almost 30 minutes to find it because there was no one on the sales floor to help or point me in the right direction.  I had to bother someone in the framing room.  It seemed like a better idea than standing in the checkout line forever to ask someone at a register.   It took WAY too much of my time to purchase one single item.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>My friend wants a scarf, we went to Michael's instead of Joann, but regretted our choice.
The cashier wasn't helpful, or friendly, we couldn't get the coupons in the phone and she didn't have the ad, which doesn't make sense, so we had to pay full price.
We bought 5 balls of yarn, but will probably return them</Review><GmapID>0x808f7bf24c63359d:0xc62b015d0aaf14c6</GmapID></record>

This place has everything you need. The first challenge is finding parking and the second usually is waiting in line. The crew makes an effort to keep the line short and moving, but it can be intimidating to see 30 plus people in line on some of the busier days. Perhaps an express or self checkout lane is in order?<//text>

I come here for yarn and knitting needles.  The place gets pretty busy and lines get long.  Don't forget to sign up for their newsletter so you can stay updated with their sales.  Parking lot can get full so you can actually park at the side of the building.<//review>
