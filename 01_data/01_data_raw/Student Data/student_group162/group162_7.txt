<review>This branch is great. Overall, I like Pizza Hut, but I have encountered a branch in Riverside that was not good. However, that was years ago. This H. H. branch has not let me down.</review>< pics>

< review>
The toppings on the pizza used to cover all of it, now there is more cheese than toppings. I also feel that adding on a service charge along with the tax and delivery charge is not very good for business. Why even have the service charge? Your corporation already charges more than enough for the pizzas.<//review>

I asked for contactless delivery and the driver called to say she was outside and didnt even want to get out of her car. Hows that acceptable? Please train your employees better.</review>

<text>Curbside experience was terrible. There was no indictor of where to park. There was no one at the front desk. I called the store and got voicemail. The person who finally answered completely ignored my request to put the pizza in the trunk and just had me roll down my window and hand it to me. He did not offer me any napkins or any other common courtesy. The pizza was awesome but overall the experience was dog poop.< /text>< user_id>

Was not impressed with the pizzas that we're ordered on 12/06/18.  I ordered 3 pizzas and one pizza seemed like it had no sauce on it and another had dry crust.  No to mention it took 1 hour and 15 minutes for the pizza to arrive so we didn't have hot pizza, it was close to room temp pizza.<//text>

I get that, considering what Pizza Hut pays people, and what those people have to deal with.

#1 Pizzahut for Terrible service!!. Placed an order to my local store and received confirmation for delivery. 30 minutes after delivery was supposed to arrive and still no pizza. I Called in and with no reasonable explanation for the wait, I received a bs excuse that no records of my name and address have ever been submitted to the store, allowing them to just ignored the online order. Unless Losing business was their goal, they were not successful today .</review>

After checking the review on google, my wife and I took our cars here.. biggest mistake.

My car: Detailing wasn’t a detailing. Not only was it sub par.. The car was barely cleaned inside and out. Interior vacuuming was 80% done (had to call the guy twice to re vacuum) and the wheels weren’t even cleaned.. Couldn’t waste more time here..</review><GmapID>0x80c2d65f5831c267:0xd2b03a077abaa273<//GmapID><userid>107293648590725513663< /userid></record></dataset><record>

I paid $ 90.00 for a car wash that includes wax and polish. Which would take 1 hour and a half, which didn't last 1/2 hour. I will not take the car again they robbed me because they did not do the job well<//Review>

I will be contacting the health department to do a check on the location because it's not right. I went for an oil change and now I will have to self monitor to see if any symptoms arise.

Absolutely the best! Stop on the way 2 visit my pops. (didn't want 2 show up with a disgusting vehicle) 2nd car in line. Got the special "hand wash & wax" & my truck came out looking brand new. Extremely nice eatery inside premises!!! So I got myself a mocha latte & a delicious sandwich. TOPS!
I Will B Back. Customer service outstanding!< /Text>

I have been taking my car to this place a few times already and now I can give my review. I would say that they have good prices and Supervisor is  very attentive and friendly ,staff also was fast and they did a great job cleaning my car . Great vacuum and cleaning the inside/outside was a well Done job. Definitely, this car wash is going to be the place where I can feel good and satisfied to have my car washed.! :) Thank you so much !</review>

I just paid 25 dollars to get my car cleaned inside and out and when I got in my car there was dirt still where the gear shift was the carpet had dirt on it still and I had to tell the guy to get the sticker off my window that was the main reason I had come to this car wash! I’m very disappointed and will not be back!</text>

<review>I've been here twice. The first time was good. The second time I went to get my lights retouched since they give you a 1 year warranty on them. They didn't have anyone available for the service. I also asked if they had a package that would give me a deep interior cleaning...the rep offered a $40 special they had going. I went with it but I basically got a wax an armor all but not a deeper cleaning on the interior.< /review>< Pictures>

I had originally gave my visit a 5 star as I've always been happy till a week ago Friday.  Guy didn't dry the roof leaving soapy film on roof sides.. middle was fine as I assumed thatth with hit it with air. In reality I could care less.. its having my rear driver's side wheel scratched.. that really bothersome. I now have to pay some one close 150 to repair clear and scratch grooves ...</text>

<review>Vitali, a Russian looking, short man claimed to be the owner. I pulled up and said I wanted the $13 package. He’s like “we’re not doing that price today.”  By the way, the prices are listed on the way in.  I was pretty upset because, it seemed he was just trying to make more money or something. I’m like “forget it, I’m out of here.” There are so many other car washes to choose from.  When a private company does business in our local towns and they can just out of the blue, claim that a small deal can’t be done on any given day, when the price is clearly listed, no one should do business with that company.  Trust me, we have a family legal private investigation business to and we can easily take advantage of the client by over charging services. Why deal with an old cranky man who wants to change prices on the time of a transaction?  My household has so many cars and I definitely won’t be bringing my business here anymore.< /review>< Pictures>

Came to get first time car wash and hand wax done for my new car. Decided to go with the offer they had of a $90 clay wax + vacuum + car wash. Car exterior looks great but inside was same/got dirtier on floor mat. I asked to vacuum my car trunk but seemed like nothing was done. WORSE thing was they messed up my car paint and also a DEEP scratch on my car door. Told this matter to front desk and a guy came to see my car. With all his might he denied everything and push the blame on ME and saying other people messed up my car instead before I came there. I paid $90 hoping to get a nice job well done but I received bad job and bad service instead. THEY EVEN FORGET THE AIR FRESHENER. What a regret. Not coming back here.</text>

Started off shaky, but now a dependable  car cleaning service where many of the services go above and beyond. Got a free center console cleaning with each wash.  Great deal going on for $35 bucks you get a standard oil change next door and a supreme car wash.  Heck of a deal.<//Text>

<Text>I came here to have the oil change.  The mechanical man met me and promised to have the brake check and car wash pkg #3 ($17.99) for free. I was then convinced by one of the lead wash man to pay $40 for a complete hand wax.
They did the oil change but no brake check.  I asked why.  The mechanic said no need because my brake didn't have any sound.  BS.

Then I wait 2 hours for the car wash and hand wax.  The wash is OK, quick, neither better nor worse than anywhere else.

The problem is the extra wax.  I waited outside and saw them not touching my car much,  did the bare minimum after 2 hours, virtually not much better than regular car wash.  When confronted with the bad job, with the bird drops still visible on the side, the con man blamed my car is old.  He told me to pay him extra $100 more to do the buffing if I want my car shining like new. I didn't want to argue with the guy, just take my key and left.

They just want your money and do the bare minimum on the wax, then trying to convince you to pay more for the bigger service of wax and buff.  I regret already pay first.  I should wait and verify the work before paying at the cashier. Lessons learned, and will never come back to meet dishonest people.

Aslo, no air conditioning inside the dirty waiting area. Don't go to this place<//Text>< pictures>

So unsatisfied with this place...they upped the prices and tried to charge me an extra 5 dollars because of my mini suv...did I say mini??? Wth? Then the owner's daughter(or whatever she is) gave me additude because I complained about tge extra charge? I've been washing my same mini suv here for year's! Why the price change plus additude! Not cool. Plus the vacuuming was less the mediocre. Not happy.<//text>

He said they did it, and I told them I was watching my car all the time and knew they did not do the wax job.

Exterior cleaned good, interior not as much - also don't like the fact that they played with my stereo, I turned it off BEFORE getting out of my car & when I left they not only turned it on but changed my programming.</Review>

The owner is a money hungry biggot who overcharges even the most loyalest customers.  They haven't increased their prices every year slowly but surely and now require a minimum of 15 dollars to use a card as a payment.  The most cheapest car wash is 14 dollars so they got you pegged to buy something I the store or go for the higher option.  I tried to tell the owner I would like 2 dollars for a tip so it should charge me so it would be 16 dollar charge which should put me over 15 dollars but he told me that the tip isn't his money so it doesn't count. I was confused and asked him if those were his employees outside washing cars in which I tipped and he looked at me with a stupid face and didn't answer.   DONT SUPPORT THIS MONEY HUNGRY OWNER!!!!  DONT COME HERE TO WASH YOUR CAR!</Text>

Worst car wash I've been too.   They use an abrasive spong, or brush and made abrasive marks on my exterior mirrors .  They didn't vacume well . Do not recommend this place at all. Stay away ...<//Review>

This a classic dive bar. Good prices and good pours. Everyone is friendy and inviting not like a small bar where regulars eyeball anyone new. Ryan the bartender is great. Friendly, welcoming, and just a great guy. Make you feel like you are regular. One of the best little local bars.< /Text>

<review>Shannon (aka the best server) made our Basin experience so enjoyable. When I asked what's the best drink/food to get Shannon did not disappoint with her recommendation. The truffle Mac n cheese and the whiskey sours made me want more!  The service simply put is the best and they put a lot of work in the drinks/food that are simply delicious and wonderful. I'd recommend anyone to this place because it caters to all types of bars. It has a dive bar feel with flash and cleanliness of an upscale, and the service to match any bar.</review></record></dataset><record>

I loved this spot! It was super hip with incredible drinks. The bartenders definitely sway more towards the "mixologist" type, so expect to wait a bit for your drink...but never fear, the wait is completely worth it. It's got a pretty young, sophisticated vibe. Great for groups!</text>

<Text>I see why The Bitter End has become my sister's favorite watering hole. The atmosphere is laid back, casual, and a great place to chill with friends over a beer or two.

At first glance, it doesn't look like much, but once you step inside, you'll see a restaurant area and then the bar area in the back. There's also a second story for those packed Friday and Saturday nights. The bartenders are all experienced and know how to have a good time. Don't be shy to pull up a stool and chat with them; they are half of the experience.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Happy hour from 5-9pm everyday! There's a little taco stand out in front the night I went. A few years ago I was allowed to bring food in, not sure if they still allow that, but if they do, there's plenty of places to get food nearby. Parking can be difficult, but it's free and if you're willing to walk a bit, be you'll be fine.< /text>

< Review>
The Bitter End is a neighborhood fixture that has been around for a long time. Lots of USF students drink here. The crowd is friendly and usually pretty talkative. It fills up quickly on weekends. They tend to play good music, an eclectic mix of old and new songs. Drinks are strong and reasonably priced. Definitely a local favorite watering hole.</Review>

<review>Good service, great sushi, open when others aren't, and when I ask for easy rice, the chef actually does easy rice.

I had a couple of minor complaints when I first started coming, and they've fixed both issues without my input whatsoever: one server was a little unfriendly, but has been great the past few times in, and they recently added more seating/tables which accommodate smaller dining parties of 1-2 people.

This is my #1 go-to!< /review><Name>Trevor Fenner</Name>< pics>

This was our first time here and the quality of the food didn't disappoint! The salad bar had unique and well prepared dishes, the meat was fresh and we had a delicious lobster special! My wife and I were extremely satisfied by the hospitality and excellent service in addition to the quality of the food!<//Text>

<Text>Our new goto Oldfield's Liquor Room place during pandemic. Their 50% off offer is a great deal. Their prices are a little high as I mentioned in my older review and I believe they raised them even more but still the 50% off discount is worth it and you get to order tons of decent food with fraction of price of other places. Give it a try, it is a nice break from ordinary take-out options.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Wow, this place is a godsend! Otto, Tommy and Stephanie are like family. I have never once had a bad experience here. Besides having a incredible assortment of beverages, sip and shop is a life saver. I could go on and on about this place, but just trust me.< /Review>< Pictures>

Very cool ny styled speak easy/ mixology type place- we went on a Wednesday and it was the perfect vibe and atmosphere for that evening- it was also pretty busy which was nice. They were holding trivia night so that was entertaining too. We also realized you can bring your own snacks to have while you sip your cocktails! Awesome!
Great bar! The kind of place where they actually know what their doing. The ginger beer is amazing. Robin is one of the best bartenders I've ever had. She made me a specialty drink that tasted better than I thought an alcoholic drink could taste.<//review>

Oldfield's Liquor Room is the bar for the sophisticated drinker who wants to enjoy high quality and quaint ambience. They have a generous happy hour every day and a daily drink special. Come with some patience and get ready to enjoy yourself.
Outdoor sitting is rather smaller with 6 tables only, but still it provides good roadside views. Heater is also provided at outdoor sitting.</Review>

This place is awesome! I always would hear about this place, but didn't get the chance to visit until once my friend and I decided to go and see what all the buzz is about. (Haha) omg let me start by saying that if you visit this place you MUST try their Mac and cheese unless your not a fan of Mac and cheese. It's the best one I had so far In LA. I also like their cocktails which taste amazing. I would totally recommend this place to everyone!</Text>

Cool small and intimate / casual spot. Not too old Hollywood and not too old Hollywood. Adrian was a huge plus. Great bartender and managed all the customers wants and needs without skipping a beat. Would love to see some live music and a larger happy hour menu.< /Review>

They were holding trivia night so that was entertaining too. We also realized you can bring your own snacks to have while you sip your cocktails! Awesome!
Great bar! The kind of place where they actually know what their doing. The ginger beer is amazing. Robin is one of the best bartenders I've ever had. She made me a specialty drink that tasted better than I thought an alcoholic drink could taste.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9rO8P6cr1zRoxw0L1rsyulnKZ3uN3SdCcaBVj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOBFMCXInOqQPuYzYHuyAJA08xTUylpz3oO1O6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

Happy hour from 5-9pm everyday! There's a little taco stand out in front the night I went. A few years ago I was allowed to bring food in, not sure if they still allow that, but if they do, there's plenty of places to get food nearby. Parking can be difficult, but it's free and if you're willing to walk a bit, be you'll be fine.<//Review>

<review>The place to enjoy friendships and spirits. You will feel like you left 2018 and went back to the late 30s. Really cool vibe with black and white tile and solid wood bar. Music isn't so loud you have to scream to hear each other. Also a great date night drink spot. No food served...just beverages.< /review>< pics>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Cool place. The venue is nice, the bartender is friendly, and never seems to be empty and rarely have I seen it over crowded. It's not a dive by any means. The crowd that typically shows is collage grads and older but not much older. There is no dance floor nor any pool tables or dart boards. Just a bar and some tables. Simple but with taste. It's different, don't know what much else to say about it, you'll have to stop by and see for yourself.<//Text><Response>None</Response>< Name>

Can't say much about the drinks themselves, as we never actually got one. This place is super busy, loud,  and the few bartenders on staff that night didn't seem in a particular hurry. Seemed like a nice atmosphere though, if you get there earlier in the evening.< /text>

It's always reminded me of romanticized western saloon, which lends itself to serious drinking and contemplation-of-life (at least for me). The last time I was here, a lady in an impressive cowboy hat stood beside me outside at 1 AM and taught me about eclipses as we watched the moon appear. First time for everything.</Review>< pics>

<text>Great cocktails, great service, great space. It does get pretty loud as everything in there is a hard surface (no noise absorption), even though it never got crowded while we were there.

We were in their back room for a birthday party and it was wonderful. Though my throat and ears hurt, so my inner grumpy old fart would appreciate some curtains or something.<//text>< Pictures>

One of my favorite spots for happy hour! Great cocktails and ambience, friendly and talented bartenders. It can get super crowded on the weekends though, and parking can be a challenge, but Bigfoot West's close by, as well as some tasty eats, so you really can't go wrong!</review>

<Review>Atmosphere is great, there was plenty of seating even with the crowded Saturday night night. Our friend booked the back room for his birthday, so our large group had more space than we normally would've. In the back room, they had extra chairs hanging on the wall that you could pull down if you needed more seating.

The cocktails are delicious and they have a few that are available during happy hour, which goes till 9 even on Saturdays! Happy hour means $7/cocktails & $5 beer/wine. The prices went up to $12/cocktail & $6-8/beer after happy hour ended.

We got there about 8:30 p.m. and parking on the street was easy just around the corner from the bar.</Review>< pics>

I recommend the delicious Vanderbilt Cup if you're looking for a cocktail recommendation.  Unfortunately the bartender missed the glass when pouring it out of the shaker and spilled half of it on the bar but once she corrected the situation it was very refreshing.

I found it very loud and hot inside - tea lights on every table and all around the bar seemed to really heat up the place.  If you're looking for quiet conversation this is not your best choice (unless you come early or sit outside).  Those complaints aside, it's a decent bar with a cool vibe.<//text>

How have I lived in Culver City forever and just found this bar?? It’s my new favorite place!! They have thee best absinthe!! If we get there early enough we can get a quite table in the back. I’m old, so I like quite, Lol! They actually let you smoke on the patio outside!! They had things called ‘ashtrays’ sitting on the tables! I was aghast!! I immediately ran to the liquor store next-door & bought an e-cig! I know, I know. But I miss drinking alcohol and smoking! Told you I was old! Wait, why am I telling you how great this place is? Now it will be packed! Uh, it sucks.. don’t go there!! 😬< /text>

This place is one of my favorite's in West LA for happy hour.  They usually have two (not great) beers on tap for $5 - and a list of rotating cocktails for $7.

The syrups and mixers are all made in-house and they have some really creative stuff on their rotating cocktail menu.

The reason they get three stars is because, while the bartenders are very nice, I don't get the feeling they "care"...  and I don't mean they don't care in that they won't listen to your problems like Sam or Woody...  I just mean that I would say about 25% of the time, when I order a beer, they give me the wrong one.</Text>

<text>This place was described as "chill" to me by a friend.  Came on a saturday night. It was anything but "chill".  Maybe I'm an old man now, but was the DJ really necessary?

< Review>
A nicely sized white tile and silver mirror room and a few small tables surrounds a shapely bar adjacent to a small patio, while a silver water cooler stands like a sentinel by the door. The decor is art deco, with an old LA feel that's bright enough to avoid a noir vibe. The cocktail list is old school, with Manhattan's, Old Fashioned's, and some house cocktails that can compete with the classics. No neon green, no hot pink, and not a blender in sight.

Happy hour is from opening at 5 until 9. Select list is $6, along with a bit of beer and wine. Try the list. It's adventurous and better than almost any other Happy Hour list you'll find. Parking can be tricky, and try not to piss off the locals.</Review>

Good drinks, nice vibe. The bartenders are chosen for their proficiency making drinks and not their cool tattoos, so that's a plus.< /Review>

Cozy place but tends to be noisy and crowded. Good drinks at reasonable prices. No food for purchase but they are usually okay with customers bringing in food from elsewhere. Sometimes they even have food trucks nearby which they encourage/promote to customers.<//text>

The name fits this establishment.  It is built in the style of an old-timee saloon, and their signiature cocktails offers a spin on many old-timee classics. They also offer punch bowls that can serve up to...well, depends on how much you like to pour!.  If I can ever gather enough people, I will totally order a huge thing of Old Fashioned.  There is also a taco stand outside that really hits the spot after a couple rounds of drinks.<//text>

< Review>
I was very excited about this place from the get-go. Prohibition-era cocktails in a semi-casual setting in walking distance of Bigfoot West sounds like a recipe for success. I went in with two of my friends on a weeknight. Now, I'll say this: we were effing enthusiastic about this place. We thought it was going to be awesome, so we were all smiles walking into the bar. Unfortunately the tall hipster brunette (who could lie in the shade of a barbed wire fence) checking IDs at the front could barely look up from her novel to acknowledge us. She looked at my ID, then rolled her eyes and sighed. As I best recall, I said, almost reassuringly, "I'm excited for this place." "I'm sure you are," she groaned. Uh, whoa. Yes, I read The Perks of Being a Wallflower in high school and at the time, it was fiercely engrossing to my 15-year-old self, but a hostess's job is to be inviting and warm, and it's the paying customers that provide the means for her paycheck. I worked in hospitality for years before moving up, so I can imagine that maybe she was just having a bad day. Still, having a bad day is no excuse to treat your customers like slime.  We got some drinks. They were fine. We walked away disappointed in the service overall.

Fast forward to a few months later, I visit again just because my friend insisted we see the place. Little did I know Queen Bee had decided to up the ante. We slip in right as the bartenders are making last call, sitting down to order one round, avoiding the girl thus far (she was busy doing some sort of janitorial work, which, on second thought, might be her primary responsibility). Then, not unlike a harpy, she intercepts to say,

"We already called last call."
"Right, we're ordering our last drinks."
"No, we already called last call. That means leave."

With a response that rude, I can only imagine a couple of scenarios. Either she graduated from a women's studies program and could only find work at a place owned by her relatives, or her primary purpose is to balance the gender ratio. Either way, she does a disservice to the entire establishment, not to mention the bartenders, because the drinks were decent and the barkeeps (male, that night) were very professional. They smile, at least.

If you can figure out when she's not working there, then it might be worth checking out. But if Her Hipsterian Majesty is manning the door, you're better off hitting up The Wellesbourne on Pico, which has better drinks and bouncers who are more professional.

On the other hand, maybe she was flirting with me, and I'm just a socially awkward penguin. In any case, no thanks. I'll see her next Tuesday.< /Review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>They put the "old" in Oldfields, but in a good way! Yes, it's another old-fashioned cocktail bar, but the ambience is relaxed and friendly, not snooty and hipsterish. They have a sizable but not overwhelming cocktail menu, as well as some craft beers on tap (just a few, as this is mostly a cocktail place). I got one of their seasonal cocktails--The Kentucky Cure (Bourbon, Branca Menta, Creme De Mure, Lemon Juice, Muddled Blackberries & Mint), and my friend got one of their signature drinks, the Blonde Comet(Bourbon, Peach Liqueur, Lemon Juice, Grapefruit Juice, Angostura Bitters). The drinks were interesting, strong, and reasonably priced. It was definitely a nice place to chill out, especially since there was a really cool DJ spinning that night. I forget the guy's name but he put on a nice variety of 60s, 70s and 80s gems. They may have styled themselves after classic 1930s and 40s lounges, but the vibe was all modern LA. Speaking of LA, parking can definitely be a challenge but if you're willing to walk you can usually find a spot down one of the nearby streets. I need to come back and try their happy hour!< /Review><resp>None< /resp>< user_name>

<Time>1582112649734</Time><text>(Translated by Google) Noisy, a problem finding parking on the weekends. Like other places like this, it closes at 2 am. It has a small veranda outside. Outside in the evening it is easy to find some street food vendor.

(Original)
Rumoroso, un problema trovare un parcheggio nei fine settimana. Come altri locali del genere chiude alle ore 2 di notte. Dispone di una piccola veranda all'esterno. All'esterno la sera è facile trovare qualche venditore di cibo da strada.<//text><rating>4< /rating></record></dataset><record>

We love it here! Our son has been a member for a while now and we could not be happier! Positive environment, great for teaching kids focus and discipline, wonderful for self defense and for teaching kids how to deal with bullying. Instructors are kind and helpful. Overall a wonderful experience and I'd recommend Caique to anyone.<//review>

My family and I have been training at Caique for several years now. The Academy Staff has a vested interest in your growth as a student (both as a person and as a Jiu jitsu practitioner). The learning environment is awesome and the curriculum is very well thought out. I would highly recommended this academy to anyone who wants to learn traditional self defense based jiu jitsu.<//Review>

I have been a part of the Caique Jiu Jitsu family for more than half of my life! The experience these guys have combined is incredible and I feel like their approach to teaching is perfect for anyone no matter what their goals are! Whether it is for exercise, learning to protect yourself, competing, they can help you with all of the above. I would recommend this to all who are interested in learning Jiu Jitsu and can honestly say that you will be treated like family!</Review>

Master Caique and his 2 sons Professor Pedro and Professor Tomaz have created an optimal environment to learn and to train.  There are no egos here just people lifting up people so that every student sees success in their journey.  Caique Jiu-Jitsu is great for everybody whether you are a beginner or advanced student, here you receive the details that come straight from the source, nothing is lost and nothing is watered down, the way it should be. This is truly a place where you can focus on learning.  I am very honored to have the opportunity to learn from these men and proud to call myself a Caique Jiu-Jitsu black belt.<//text>

Outstanding academy and instructors, came through from an Affiliate and was treated like I belonged from the time I arrived. The class and drills were spot on and definitely in line with traditional Jiu-Jitsu.  Highly recommend, you won’t regret it. Good group of solid dudes<//Review>

<Text>Training at Caique Jiu Jitsu Academy has been the one of the best things happened in my life. I've been training at the academy for 5 years and always feel blessed and inspired by Professor Thomas and Pedro for their devotion to Jiu Jitsu and care for the students.
Even to this day after 5 years, I was blown away by them to see the emphasis of basic techniques of Gracie Jiu Jitsu. You may see and learn all the fancy techniques from videos or other school what not, but their efforts to teach the basics so prominent that I was always amazed to see the new students transformed to real good Jiu Jitsu practitioners.
Now my two kids train together, and I can hardly wait to see the transformation later, too. Not only the intention to train the kids to be good at Jiu Jitsu, but as athletic soccer players, I'm 100% sure it will help them greater for their soccer journey, too.
And one day, they will also see the greatness of Gracie Jiu Jitsu and thank me I introduced them.😀🥰< /Text>< Pictures>

As a Jiu-Jitsu practitioner for over 20 years I can tell you that this is the place to learn authentic Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. They teach the self-defense program which in my opinion is a must for anyone learning Jiu-Jitsu.<//Review>

Master Caique is Elias is one of only eight non-Gracies ever to receive his black belt directly from Hélio Gracie. His academy embodies the Gracie's spirit and the essence of Jiu Jitsu. Environment friendly for all. I recommend giving it a try. Your life will change! #jiujistusaves</review>

One of best things happened in my life that I found this place and have been training with best instructors and friends. I always feel so lucky to have them here in South bay although I wish I started early. But this is best to learn self defense, lose weight, learn discipline and making new friends.
It's no wonder why so many kids here learn self defense and having good time.
This is amazing place, instructors and students. Ever since I joined 2 yrs ago, this is all I think about how to defend bigger, stronger opponents, how to do self defense, how to get better, how to learn and use techniques. Simply, AMAZING!< /Review>

Caique BJJ has changed my life not only on the mats, but the confidence and problem solving skills I’ve obtained since training Caique BJJ. The professors and students that train there is like a family, and the professors mentorship is world class. I promise you won’t find a better academy any where else in the South Bay.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>So glad we found this great place to learn jiu jitsu!  Every class is a good balance of review, drill, sparring and new techniques.  At the end of class, my 13 y.o. dd is tired, but always smiling because she gained skills and had fun. The instructors are really great mentors too -  welcoming and caring but also no nonsense.  The instructors make sure that newbies are just as comfortable and safe as the experienced students. All the coaches are great but special shout out to John. He was so down to earth and encouraging that my shy daughter was hooked after her free trial lesson and was ready to walk into a class of strangers in order to learn more.  We love that our daughter is getting such practical skills for self defense and body discipline. Thanks Caique Jiu Jitsu!</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
I have been training here for roughly seven months now and feel qualified to leave a review.

Short version:

I love this place and would recommend anyone (man/woman/child) come give a class a shot. It's clean, there's plenty of parking and everyone is friendly.

Longer Version:

The curriculum here is centered around self-defense concepts which I feel is essential. While some of the moves you learn here certainly do look cool, they are all centered around keeping you safe in the event somebody bigger and stronger than you decides to do you some wrong.

Most importantly, this stuff works. I'm a relatively big and strong guy but the smaller guys in here with more experience can neutralize me quickly. A truly effective art taught by a very knowledgeable family.

If you're looking to spar in a safe environment, all the guys here are respectful of their training partners and the higher belts are not only patient with new trainees but also very helpful.

My 6 year old son has been coming here for about 2 years. I am so impressed with the instructors and how they work with the children. My son is very hyperactive and needs to be kept on task, the instructors are firm and consistent with him. Not only do they teach them jiu jitsu but they also teach them respect and how to be a better person. This is more than just self defense and I am grateful for their guidance.</text>

We love the care and attention Pedro, Brennan and John put into the classes as well as the individual attention they pay to each and every student. My son has gone from being very timid to being someone who I feel could protect me from an attack. Now he tells me,at 13, that he wants to protect me from bad guys. It’s pretty neat to see this transformation. In addition to learning jiu jitsu, we really appreciate the life lessons and positive teachings they discuss at the end of class. I couldn’t be happier with the progress my son is making and we plan to be here for years to come! Thank you to all of wonderful teachers at Caique Jiu Jitsu!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Academy culture is family-oriented, friendly and open to all, kids and parents.  Can’t say enough about the quality of instruction.  Each session is planned out and organized, with each individual move within the session explained, demo'd and drilled through sparring.  Discipline/fun ratio is dialed in perfectly.

A year ago if you had told me Jiu-Jitsu would be my thing, I would have laughed, I'm a dancer...but meeting, and now training with Master Caique, and his incredible sons, Prof. Pedro & Prof. Thomaz has changed my thinking. What an opportunity to learn this empowering martial art from a legend and his legacy. They are the best of the best. I'm adding Caique Jiu-Jitsu to my training regime! :)</text>

I trained at Caique Jiu Jitsu for over two years and it was a great experience. The whole atmosphere in the place is friendly and genuine. The instructors are phenomenal, they break down each move and show you how  it works in a way thats easy to grasp. The mats are always clean and the hours are very flexible for any schedule. Overall I would recommend Caique Jiu Jitsu to anyone interested in training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.< /Text>

This school is amazing. The instructors are very skilled and knowledgeable. As far as I'm concerned, this is the best Jiu Jitsu school in Southern California. Pedro and Tomas are not just instructors, they have also proven their Jiu Jitsu skills at tournaments meaning they know how to use Jiu Jitsu techniques.  If anyone is seriously interested in learning Jiu Jitsu, this is the place to learn. I travel more than 50 miles to train at this dojo and I drive past many others without even thinking about them. This dojo makes you earn your stripes and belts. Nothing is given here.< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I live in RPV and had been thinking of starting to practice jiu-jitsu even though I am 55 years old. Me and my teenage son signed up together. It has been a great experience to start jiujitsu in my 50s. It has been challenging but the way Prof. Pedro teaches the class doesn't require athleticism and I can do all of the moves fairly easily. Though remembering is another story  ha. Prof. Pedro and his brother prof. Thomaz learned from their father master Caique Elias who is a legend in jiujitsu and a student of Helio and Rickson Gracie! Master Caique was regarded by grand master Helio Gracie as his best student. The Elias family practices with master Rickson Gracie to this day as you can see in the pic below. Profs. Pedro and Thomaz training under master Rickson Gracie's eye. Happy to be here and wanted to share!<//Review>< Pictures>

I love the friendly, positive, and welcoming atmosphere of CJJ.
The instruction is hands-on and the classes are very structured,
making it possible for anyone to learn and grow. The instructors
are incredibly skilled and patient with the students but simultaneously
make the classes challenging. Great classes for all ages and skill

Caique BJJ has instructors who care about their students. They have a family atmosphere while teaching techniques that cover a wide range of situations, from defending ourselves to getting us ready for competition. There's a reason why Rickson asked Caique's sons to be his partner on his instructional. I'm fortunate to have found this place.<//text>

<Review>Caique Jiu Jitsu literally saved my life! After gaining 100+ pounds when I lost my thyroid, I could hardly move, let alone look at myself in the mirror. I could feel myself creeping closer and closer to death when I started training at Caique's. It was tough at first, but I didn't take long for me to begin losing weight, gaining stamina, and increasing flexibility. My mental outlook vastly increased as well as I gained more confidence in myself and my fitness.

I lost 70+ pounds in the first year alone and now I cant imagine my life without jiu jitsu. The staff at Caique Jiu Jitsu is very knowledgeable, and truly wants to help all of their students succeed. I have made many great friends, and feel truly blessed to have such a positive experience in my life. I would recommend this place to anyone, no matter your physical fitness level or previous martial arts experience.</Review>< pics>

I love this place very much. It's a great place to learn self defence for any age. When I started my classes they gave me a free trail and I learned many ways to protect myself, especially against people larger than me. I have been in caique for almost two years and it was a great confidence builder as well as a way to focus my stress elsewhere. Now I can lift and throw people twice my size when before I could barely lift my own size. The instructors are great and always put safety first before anything else. I'm sure it will be a very long time before I leave this academy to pursue a new passion because jiu jitsu is my current passion. You could be the calmest, shyest, and most timid person there is but sooner or later you will open up and have enough confidence to open out. I for one think of the academy as second family, cause that's how they treat me and everyone else.<//review>

I have been training at Caique BJJ for about 5 years and it is like my second home. There is a very friendly environment and the general feel of the academy is one of a very big family. I have trained at various academies over the years and the instructors at Caique are of the highest caliber. If you are in the South Bay and are looking for a BJJ school definitely check out Caique.</Review>

<text>TLDR Version:
I can say I've learned more in 1 year here than all my other years of training combined (2 years fully training, 3 years on and off). Surprisingly, they're better than the Official Gracie Academy. If you don't believe me, at least owe it to yourself to get a free trial at both locations.

Long Version:
These guys need a bad review, all these 5 star reviews makes all the reviews seem fake. Though I won't be the one to give it to them.

A long time ago, I saw a sign for a free trial at Caique Jiu Jitsu Academy and the chance to train at the Official Gracie Academy. My knee jerk reaction was to go train at the Gracie Academy because the Gracies must teach Gracie Jiu Jitsu better than some random guy, why bother wasting my time even trying Caique? I trained at Gracie Academy for a year and only a few years later found out my mistake.

I've trained at the Gracie Academy for a year before switching between many schools over a period of 5 years. This place has the best instruction quality I've seen yet. They are very meticulous about all the details, and that's how you get good at Jiu Jitsu. I can say I've learned more in 1 year here than all my other years of training combined (2 years fully training, 3 years on and off).

They are more interested in your development in Jiu Jitsu and less interested in your money. Promotion tests are completely free. In addition, they are honest to a fault. One of the teachers Thomaz is a very bad salesman. I asked to take a private lesson with him before a promotion test. He said he's seen enough to know that I'll pass and to save my money. In addition, he said that he's not doing private lessons for students who want it just for the promotion test, he wants students who actually know the moves to pass the test and not just cram then forget.

Many years ago, I wrote these guys off because they're only famous in the Jiu Jitsu world and not famous in general (Gracies, famous UFC fighters, etc...). DO NOT make my mistake. At least take a free trial. One of my regrets is not starting here from the very beginning.<//text><gmap_id>0x80dd4a60df41c3ab:0xa49364bbb685e5ff<//gmap_id><user>101042841011160880306</user><Resp>None</Resp>< rating>

I live blocks away from this school.  I literally walked by this place once a day for 3 years and finally went in to check it out.  I am glad I did, I am not glad that I waited so long!  I was instantly taken by the inviting and warm atmosphere, cool people and great facilities.  One thing that has stuck with me since I started is that all the instructors and Master Caique himself knew and remembered my name after my first class!  For some this may not be a huge thing, but at an academy this large, it is really something remarkable.  I really cannot say enough about the art of BJJ for being a great way to stay in shape, and learn incredibly effective self defense.

You don't have to be anyone with a fighting art background or super athletic, when I first started I was 40 lbs heavier and had no idea what I was doing.  After 8 months I competed in my first tournament and took second place!  Moms, Dads, kids, everyone is welcome and is a really great atmosphere and great way to get out of the "gym".

If you have done your research you will know that this place has an incredible lineage.  Grand Master Helio gave Master Caique his black belt in BJJ and Rickson Gracie himself gave Master Caique his Coral Belt.  Not many schools can claim that.< /text>

When the student is ready, the teacher will appear...I am very grateful to Master Caique and all the instructors at the academy for teaching my kids and myself BJJ.

My kids and myself have been training at Caique's BJJ academy since 2009.
I originally signed my son up because he was scrawny and I was afraid he would get picked on as he got older.  Four years into it, my son has had to use what he learned twice to protect himself.  The best part about it is he has learned not only to protect himself but done in a manner of control without hurting the aggressor which has helped him garner respect and self confidence.

Master Caique and his staff keep a clean and well run academy emphasizing self defense and practical techniques that you can utilize in various situations (self defense or just rolling with other BJJ practitioners).

If you're curious or want to see why this is such a great BJJ academy, come by during their scheduled classes and observe the curriculum and how it is taught (for both adults and kids)!

BTW, if you think you're too old to learn BJJ, think again.  There are students from all walks of life ages 5 up to 60+ at the academy and it is a great environment conducive to learning.</review>

<Review>5 stars across the board they went above and beyond to install my lowering springs perfectly. They also gave me an alignment for a great price!

<Review>Glad I found this shop. They did amazing work on my Xterra. I needed a lift kit installed along with an alignment. I called and was told to come on down and that they could get it done in a few hours. Super professional and super courteous people. I plan on coming back for front brakes soon.< /Review>< Pictures>

Second time here because had such a good experience the first time. Rafael is a great guy. Super positive, friendly and what matters most , fast and fair. Took my brand new car here to install an aftermarket motor mount not knowing if he did this type of work. He assured me that he does along with several other suspension related services.
Long story short. He pulled my car right in, swapped the motor mount and had me out in no time.
This guy is the real deal. You can tell he loves what he does. You won’t be disappointed going to him.</text>

<text>These people are rude. I called to ask if the work on Cadillac and the man mumbled something and then hung up in my face. No you will not get my business. Professionalism. He even answered the phone “Yo”. This place is ghetto.< /text>< pics>

He’s worked on my springs, shocks, ball joints, put on new rims, put on new tires, lowered both my cars, and more. I am completely satisfied with the results every time. He is a one man army, he was working on my car and handling walk-in customers at the same time in between. He works very hard and also a nice friendly person, and very honest in my opinion. 5 stars</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Rafa installed my full suspension on my 98 Camaro.
Shocks, springs, new shock cups, bushings, control arms, sway bars... When I say full I mean full. Charged me an amazing price threw in the alignment and had me done ahead of schedule. A true professional. These are the types of business that you want to support and keep them open. He gives great service and price. People run to the big names cuz they know the name but you have to go to guys like this for the service you expect. I'm writing this about 3 years after the install. Everything is great, I just looked up the number cuz I need an alignment on one of my other cars but wanted to leave a great review again.</Review>

I was told to purchase a part online and the labor would be free of charge but when I came back with the part the guy charged me $120 after the labor was complete. I don’t mind paying for service but I don’t like being lied to just so I can return to a particular shop. If I would have known I had to pay for labor I would have shopped around for the best price but he didn’t give me that option. He told me he would install the part free of charge just so I can return to his shop then when I did he charged me.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I work on cars myself, but i cant do big repair jobs where i live so i go to him because I know he has the best prices on labor.
He is real honest and he explains everything to you when you ask him about something.
He also has the best prices on new and used tires!<//Text><user_name>Rickedafied RJE<//user_name><rating>5</rating></record></dataset><record>

I have been trying to find a shop where I can get some coilovers installed and other places were either ridiculously expensive, or required days in advance. I went here and Rafael was very helpful and gave me a reasonable price. He said it would take him about 4-5 hours but he did it in 3 hours. Setup the height and did everything very professionally. Great shop and great customer service.< /review>< Rate>

<Review>1 went to back to this shop after a week of his work.  I spoke to the guy who did the job before or maybe his the owner but the didnt even looked at the tires but rather talk too much  negative things like he knows i will come back because i asked for receipt from his work.  Its my right to have a recipt of his job and for my taxes.  I only came back to ask if its normal to have black markings on the outer side of my new tires.  I remember and saw that he only worked on my front tires and the rear tires he didnt make any adjustments....  DONT use this guys shop and service...  he talked too much to get your attention BUT doesnt do the right job....  it will be a waste of money because you will bring your tires to another shop to do rework and inacse dont let him rework on your tires the 2nd time if his complaining already because he will for sure mess up you car.  BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE...</Review><rate>1</rate>< Date>

Came to get my Ram R/T 2017 lowered, truck looked beautiful when i came back to pick it up. Very friendly customer service and will come back for future upgrades to my truck. Recommended for those who have trucks that are trying to lower them and are looking for a good not that pricey spot.<//Review>

<text>I'd admit that it's hard to find a mechanic, now days that will say what he, means & does exactly what you need him to do!  That's a very rare quality "But! this mechanic-is truly a Blessing and honest. And honesty in this world is very hard to find, but you'll find that in Rafael; at Quick-Tires.
Don't take my, words for it!  Go & see for yourshelves.

PS.Go and get it done!</text>< Pics>

<text>I was more than thrilled to meet Rafael. He really knows his stuff... easy to talk to and answers questions. Very reasonable pricing. Very accommodating . He was able to work on my CRV the same day... I was in and out of there in under 3 hours and he replaced all four of my struts, adjusted my rack and pinion and realign my steering wheel. So glad I found this hidden gem in Gardena!!</text>< Pictures>

"DONE AMIGO!" I was shocked. Even the guy that was waiting to be next said DAMN that was fast. I kid you not thats how it went and on top of it he said... $40. I had went to a place just before this and the mechanic said he needed 3hours and $80 for the same repair. THIS MAN IS AWESOME!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Raphael is one of the most positive people I have met, he installed airbags on my truck, and did an awesome job, for the amount he said it would cost, even though he worked all day and into the night getting everything just right. I will return to get my front end aligned next month.</Review>

<Review>My biggest concern is with their honesty. They do great service, however I've noticed they try to take advantage of you by getting you to change out parts before necessary. They tried to sell me a new battery because mime had corrosion on it. 1. Batteries work just fine with corrosion on the outside. 2. My battery was less than 2 years old, and working just fine (went to interstate battery directly following to have it checked).

They also often tell me my cabin air filter needs changing before it really does. I do this service on my own to save money.

All in all, an okay service. They are quick, and keep you in the loop with phone calls during the service.</Review>< Response>
{'time': 1623852115115, 'text': 'Andrea, filters are in need of replacement at your mileage of 90K. This is a standard suggestion. If you are doing your own repairs I suggest you tell us so we can note it. Also, after speaking to Mario and reveiwing your work order, your battery was found to be corroded which was only noted with no suggestion of replacement. I apologize if there was a misunderstanding.\nWe pride ourselves on our honesty and good service.'}< /Response>

Menlo Atherton Auto Repair did an oil change and general checkup on my car, and the whole process was quick and they were in constant contact throughout.  The staff is always so nice, and they are great with continuing engagement between scheduled maintenance.  They are the very definition of excellent mechanics.<//Text>

<Text>Thank you so much for your help at Menlo Atherton auto repair! Such great service. I was stuck out of town with a flat tire and no donut in the car!  A passerby recommended Menlo Atherton auto repair, which was right around the corner. I called and spoke to Ryan over there, he said I could get towed over and hopefully they could get my new tire in as soon as possible. They got me in and out within a few hours! What a relief. Thanks so much again!< /Text><GmapID>0x808fa4a671f4cac3:0x49fd2870aa28dba7< /GmapID><Rating>5</Rating></record>

<review>My car recently overheated due to broken heater hoses (which Menlo Atherton Auto Repair diagnosed and fixed). I called AAA to have it towed, but was in the search for a new mechanic, so relied on AAA for the reference. So glad they sent me to Menlo Atherton Auto Repair. They did such a good job, with great customer service, that I now know where I’ll be taking my car for future maintenance and service!<//review>< resp>

The mechanics were really professional and very friendly. They were able to get my car in the day of and they got it back to me within a couple of hours. I also like that they are only a 3 block walk from my apartment; that makes it very convenient for me. Great work!<//Text>

These guys are life savers. I had a tire light come on and pulled up right at closing. Without hesitation they checked out my tired and fixed it on the spot with no hassle. I could tell they were itching to end their day but didn't hesitate to help. True professionals! Thank you again guys.< /review>

I left a yelp review but I was impressed. I had an excellent experience. I thought the pricing was fair. I work in Menlo Park and they even thought of a possibility to drive my truck to my work because I got off when they closed. I felt like they went above and beyond. Great service. Great pricing. Very professional. 5 star all the way.</Review>

I moved to the bay area in May 2019 and was worried about finding a new mechanic. I came across Menlo Atherton Auto Repair online. These guys have been wonderful. Honest, good mechanics. They’ve helped me with several car issues since I moved to CA and have always fit me in & provided repairs quickly, while still providing quality service at a fair price. I highly recommend Menlo Atherton Auto Repair!< /Review>

Great experience from the auto staff, 1 star off seemed bit steep in price even after they took off couple hundred, which was nice of them.  Shout-out to Allen!
Got my water pump thermostat coolant flush and oil change they were quick and took me in last minute as it was emergency water pump broke on 101 and they were highly rated and nearest, didn't have choice.
Not in area but in SJ and overall very satisfied with professionalism and quick turnaround no fuss but little pricey.
I'd recommend them to anyone in the area needs work done reliably and quick for the job.<//Text>

I very much appreciated their professionalism and the safety measures they were taking during COVID-19 like even wiping down things they touched inside my car before I got back in it.

< Review>
My experience with Menlo Atherton Auto Repair was almost perfect. They were timely in contacting me and following up with information. Service was reasonably priced and options were well communicated. When I picked my car up it was sitting outside with the windows rolled down while ash was falling everywhere due to the nearby wildfires. I’m sure it was a simple oversight, but the interior of my car was covered in ash because of it. I had just detailed the interior a week before so this was certainly a damper on an otherwise great experience.<//Review>

This is my first time getting their service. It is definitely the place that I will come back again. The kindest and professional staff not only provide you detailed explanation on each service item; providing detailed quotation, each inspection item, and the quote with the best price they can give you. Not feeling any pressure when you need to take more time to consider the service. The most important thing, the service and the turned out is good! Highly recommmend!< /Text>

My wife had an engine / radiator hose spring a leak.  As a result, the vehicle was towed to Menlo Atherton Auto Repair.  The communication, professionalism and follow through in dealing with Steven was outstanding.  The problem was diagnosed, Steven proposed a solution, the vehicle was picked up the following day. Steven’s interaction with my wife and I was 5 Star, turning an unpleasant situation, into a predictable one. Thank you Steven.</Text>

<text>Excellent service all around. Truly no need to go to car dealers for regular service if it’s out of pocket (oil change, safety checks and more.). Best service, quick, professional, nice, honest, and much cheaper than the service at dealerships. They fixed 3 of our cars (Tires, battery, rusty cables and more) and just did an oil change. I always get update calls, and they throw in a coupon to make it even better value. Highly recommend them!< /text>< response>

<Review>A good shop that explain the details, give you the options and allow you to make your decisions. It’s always hard when you move to find a mechanic, but we are happy with this crew. They aren’t the cheapest, but then again they aren’t in a cheap location. What you get, is quality work, good communication and done on time.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Review>Very HONEST!  I came here to get a tire patched.  They took the tire off and after dunking it in water did not find a hole or anywhere requiring patching.  They sent me on my way with no charge and advised I keep an eye on it.  They could have easily charged me for a patch even though one wasn't required.<//Review>< name>

<Text>tldr: scammers; tried to bill me for work they didn't do. Avoid and don't rely on them being honest if you don't know your stuff. The mechanic that I talked to was Allan.

Came for a smog check. For context, your car computer (ecu) does a bunch of self diagnostics for smog that get reset if it loses power (replacing battery). These self-tests will run again as you drive more miles (called drive cycle). I mentioned that I recently replaced my car battery but also drove a bunch of miles after the replacement so the self-diagnostics should be there. When I came to pick up the car they tried to bill me for $100 in labor on top of the $60 smog check claiming that they had to reset the ECU and do a drive cycle themselves to get the self-diagnostics. I pointed out that the milage on the car did not change while it was in the shop, which is not possible if they actually did a drive cycle. They had a bunch of excuses but eventually wrote off the $100. Also tried to upsell me on a bunch of BS like $110 for an cabin air filter change (a $15 part and a one minute job that anyone can do). The upsell and high prices I can look past, but the dishonesty and fraud for work they didn't do is inexcusable. The extra stupid part was that I had a minor fender bender that I asked for a quote for before they tried to scam me which would've been easily an extra honest $1k that they could've made, but I'm definitely not giving them my business now.

Update Nov 24, 2020 – Replying to the owner's reply:
I checked with a different mechanic before writing this review. It is impossible that you reseted the ECU and did a drive cycle while accumulating ZERO miles. When I left I was specifically told that the mechanic that did the work on my vehicle would call to explain why they attempted to charge me for that work, which they never did. I can only imagine why. I was not discounted anything. I was charged $96.50 for the labour that you didn't do, and $58.2 for the smog check, which is the same price as listed on your website. I paid $58.2+tax when I left the shop. Removing $96.50 for work you didn't do is not a discount.< /Text><date>1606256054359<//date>< gmapID>

They were very accommodating in every way and, of course, the actual work and communication was up to their usual high standards. I only gave them 4 stars because I felt the final bill was a bit too high. But, you do get what you pay for.< /text>

It is great to be able to trust the shop to evaluate the problem and give a straight answer.  None of us non-mechanics know what the Check Engine light ever means. It was good that the shop tested the car thoroughly,  and realized that all I really needed was a new gas cap.</review>

< Review>
The crew at Menlo-Atherton Auto Repair have become the trustworthy and go-to auto experts in my life. I have taken my cars over the years for help on a variety of issues, from routine maintenance to major repair, and they have consistently provided excellent service and communication. The most recent service helped me coordinate replacing the bumper and perform the necessary extras. I highly recommend their expertise and dedication to customer service.<//Review>

Fantastic service. Ronaldo was friendly and transparent, helped break down the pros and cons of ordering a replacement part myself, and even referred me to a body shop which could do the repainting job I needed at a lower cost than they could. Will definitely be coming back here in the future.< /text>

MA Auto is a scam shop.  They recommended $2,500 in suspension work to service "damaged parts".  My buddy's mechanic said the only issue is the strut mount came loose.  He installed the nut my suspension worked perfectly.  They pretended my strut was bent too.  No damage found. Avoid. Con shop , especially Allan, this dude will lie to your face<//Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>The employees at Menlo Atherton Auto Repair are AWESOME,  especially Ryan! I moved to Menlo Park last September, 2018 and needed to find a reliable, trustworthy auto repair shop to get an oil change and safety check for my 2003 Subaru Forester. I looked online and saw that Menlo Atherton Auto Repair had a coupon, which saved me money, and they also gave me a discount for being a AAA member, which saved me even more. Ryan let me know what my car needed to have done in order to be safe, and when I told him I couldn’t afford to do all the repairs at once, he printed out a prioritized list of what was most essential, starting with the brakes. Over the next 10-months I had a number of repairs done, and the service was always excellent and the employees courteous and friendly. I give Menlo Atherton Auto Repair my highest recommendation and am very grateful for all the help they gave with my aging car.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

I brought my car in for regular maintenance. They shuttled me to work and dropped the car off there that afternoon.

I brought my car in again for some sudden car trouble. They very kindly considered the difficulty my car trouble put me in did the diagnosis for free. Much obliged.</text>

I have been coming to this auto shop for almost decade since I moved to this neighborhood. Their service is always reliable and staff courteous. Moreover, what makes this place stands out is their simple act of kindness, may that be providing a free ride to my work place, or wiping down the interior and door handles after service during the pandemic, or fixing a cosmetic problem of my fender bender (out of their duty list and for free)... I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for good service and beyond!</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>One of the best auto repair shops in the Bay Area. Not only did they take me same day with little notice, provide waived fees/low cost options, but they also kept me updated every few hours on the status of my car. Special shout-out to Steven at the front desk who is hands down one of the most professional and reliable service managers I've met. Highly recommend!<//text>< Pics>

After a couple of hours waiting, the staff told me that they could not rotate them because the rear tires are worn more than the front ones and suggest me get a new pair of tires and gave me a quote.

Checked a few websites afterwords, almost all of them say "put the best tires on the back." The shop is either unprofessional or just wanted to make money by selling me tires.

The worst thing is that it was waste of my time for hours!< /review><Gmap_id>0x808fa4a671f4cac3:0x49fd2870aa28dba7</Gmap_id><date>1576540902274</date>< Response>

We love Menlo Atherton Auto Repair. Mario, KC, Ryan, Allan just to name a few are excellent at what they do. We have brought our cars here for over ten years and have never had one problem- never. They are professional, on-time, look for ways to reduce my bill and always work with us for our various needs. I could not recommend them with more deep respect, appreciation and gratitude.</review>

Clear, transparent, and good job. MA auto repair fixed my breaks, did the 100k service, and helped get my A/C working again. Thanks!

Repeat customer a second time. Tire pressure light failed and they found a way to reprogram it rather than just replacing it, saving me hundreds!  Love their honesty and respect!< /Review>

<review>THIS PLACE SAVED ME!!!
I was from out of town and my car broke down one Saturday night - needed to get back home 250 miles away ASAP. I happened to have parked about 100 feet away from the facility & noticed them. Called first thing Monday at 6 AM when they opened- very convenient; Mario was great: said they’d help me out immediately so I could get back home that day. I brought car in, they identified problem (broken alternator) and had it repaired car within 3 hours! Mario was very understanding, helpful and professional; and cost of repair was reasonable (considering the area). I was able to get back on my way and was extremely grateful!!!</review>< user_id>

<user>107934205003931989613</user><rate>1<//rate>< Review>
Writing on Yelp and Google Reviews for more exposure (Prices and [multiple] experience[s] detailed below!].  Warning: long review.  TLDR: they are nice, but they are very expensive, they will take advantage of you, and they charge unnecessarily when they can.

I don't believe anyone should be taken advantage of as much as my girlfriend has been.  I will say that their service seems very friendly, but as I've seen from many other reviews, they charge a lot more than they should against the customers who don't know better as you'll see below.

What should've been a quick diagnostic and battery + starter replacement turned into a $95 + $195 + $180 + $90 = $565 fiasco which resulted in a new battery (at least this was fixed), and her car still dead the next morning.  Now, let me breakdown the prices I mentioned above with her experience (on the days before her birthday today, no less).

On Saturday, she was able to get her car into the shop to diagnose a problem with the electrical system, for at this point the battery had died on her and I had to jump her car.  After about 45 minutes, she walked away with a $95 bill for labor and "No problems found here, no need for a new battery," despite her asking for a new battery in the first place.  This is error #1, as any battery diagnostic should be of no charge (as it is at Autozone or O'Reileys!  Life Pro-tip for you there!), and they "nicely convinced" her against the new battery despite the fact that hers was already 4 years old (good practice is to replace every 5 yrs, so she might as well get it replaced and then run a diagnostics on the problem, but no).  They also mentioned some sort of leaking fluid and to come in ASAP again.  OK, no problem with that, so we will move on to yesterday (Monday).

Car has been OK to this point (thankfully), but to keep ahead on maintenance, she came in to have them check the leaking fluid issue and then Uber'd home.  Several hours later and she gets a call, "Hey, your car won't turn on, so we are going to change the battery, is that OK?"  Perfect!  This is what we wanted in the first place, so she says go ahead.  Later, when she Uber'd back to pick up her car, she was presented with two separate bills; $180 for the Interstate battery (I'd say about $20 high, but no problem since this battery isn't available for the regular customer) and $90 for labor (for about a 5 minute job that the average joe schmoe could do or have done for free at, you guessed it, Autozone/Pepboys/O'Reileys!).  This is error #2.  Now, keep in mind they had already charged her $95 for the "inspection fee" and didn't provide a discount or warranty on their original diagnostic, so the entire battery replacement cost a total of $365 when a typical one (AKA one I did at a Union 76 runs closer to $210, or all of $120 to do by hand if you don't care about the Interstate battery).

Now for error #3 (at least this is my personal opinion).  The final charge of $195 was for the leakage diagnostic.  This service included steam cleaning the engine (hopefully done properly, because some shops use a high pressure/temperature washer too close and can actually damage components in the engine compartment area), waiting for things to dry, then driving around for a couple of miles.  Not only is this about an hour procedure, but they failed to identify the issue and charged her regardless and asked her to return after 50-100 miles with no promise of a discount on return.  The error (and flaw, and this is my personal opinion) is that when someone is running a diagnostic/check for something and cannot figure out what is wrong, then there should not be a charge (or at least a discount if it is figured out later, unlike the battery scenario described above).  Imagine you call a plumber for a toilet that won't flush; he/she attempts to fix it by using a plunger for a bit, doesn't fix the problem, then charges you for his labor and tells you he'll come back later to try again and likely charge you the same amount for labor, then 1.5x for the part.< /Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>We came from Fresno for a Doctors appointment at Stanford Hospital.  The night before, I must have picked up a large screw in my tire as we entered town for the night.   We were lucky to not lose any air in the tire the night before.  After our appointment, we stopped here at Menlo Atherton Auto Repair to see if we could get the tire plugged up.  Allen helped us get back on the road in a matter of minutes.  My wife and I couldn't be more grateful! A+ business!

<Review>Brought my truck here the other day to diagnose steering. They couldnt find the problem but they didn't charge me for diagnosis and suggested I take it to another shop to get another opinion.

I respect and appreciate everyone who serviced me at this location. I had a good first experience with them and will surely be back for future buisness.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I've been a customer for over 15 years. Tony and the team have serviced my Jaguar, Mercedes and Subaru. Service has been routine as well as an extensive repair to the cooling evaporator on my Mercedes which required the entire dashboard to be removed to get to the part. Cost was about 2/3rd of what the dealer would charge and the job was done perfectly. Most simple stuff, like burned out lamps, are fixed while you wait. A great auto shop. Plus, they will drive you home when you drop off your car.</Review>

No problems with the work. I was booked in the next day for a 60K service which was done promptly .
However the charges were way above what I would expect from an independent garage. E.g they charged $525 for what should be no more than $300. Fuel filter was charged as $86 + $114 for labor. The filter and O rings can be had for $25 and it takes about 10 minutes to replace and maybe 5 minutes to prime the lines through the VCDS diagnostics, so maybe 15 minutes total.
I expect to pay a bit extra for garage service, but I won't be returning here at their prices.< /text>

Went in for an oil change and have both headlight replaced. They managed to fix the left headlight and successfully change my oil, but they did mess up the wiring of my right headlight which worked before bringing it in. Costumer service was super nice though.<//Review>

< Review>
Did an acceptable job on a smog check, but let air out of my tires without asking  as part of a 'courtesy check'. CA regulations do require a pressure check, but only require inflation not deflation. Made vehicle unsafe to use with my hitch mounted bike rack until I re-inflate.

Update: They also tried to sell me on an unnecessary belt replacement. Regular trusted mechanic / shop confirmed the belts are just fine.<//Review>

Had a nail in my tire and it was flat. I called AAA butwas told they only tow to a repair shop and wouldn't fix it. I pumped up the tire so I could limp to a repair shop myself. I called Menlo Atherton Auto Repair and they said to bring it down and the fee would be $24. After it was repaired the said "No charge". Made my day. Thanks M-A Auto repair< /Text>

< Review>
Always pay attention to what I need, whether it is something that needs to be fixed on the car, or something that I can wait on or leave as it is. I appreciate it!<//Review>

<Text>Use to be my Favorite Place to Eat Until Today Sept.29,2020 ! I had a bowl with almost everything on it and I had already eaten about 5 bites, when suddenly see something moving around. I took out a spoon full of food where I saw the movement and come to find a tiny green worm just moving all around . It was so Disgusting! I DO NOT recommend this restaurant after this ! This is not sanitary and I hope people don’t go here Ever !</Text><user>109003090815344286188</user><Rating>1</Rating><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< gmapID>

<review>Horrible!!! chicken had sauce on it (was not grilled as they promoted) and tasted like dipped in old oil. Veggies did not look fresh. They had no cilantro sauce left (like in pictures) and employee was so, but so rude that it make me feel stupid and humiliated for even considering going there to eat. It would have been nice if ingredients was really fresh like in the promoted pictures...

A wide selection of veggies, base, sauces, and protein for your Korean fusion bowl! Decently priced, too, with chicken bowls at less than $9!<//review>

I came in to the area because I needed a phone repair from someone in the area. I had asked a friend which place was cool to dine at for lunch, and he recommended this place to me along with a link to their site. \

Originally, i thought it was like a Mongolian barbecue place because of how the menu was set up. I also thought it was like a Poke Bar place, but it thought, what the hell, i want to explore something i havent seen or tried, so 6 minute drive later, and easy parking - here I am, enjoying this super delicious bowl i've put together before my very eyes.

I had mine with the Buckwheat Noodle base - Delicious. Also had it with the Peanut sauce. ITS DELICIOUS. im coming back to try the Nori sauce next. I was able to sample it as i was there - it was really good, and it deserved a spot in my belly, but i was in a peanut mood this day, so peanut gets it.

Youre able to get the sauces either on the bowl or in the side. As for to-go, you can also ask for another pack of sauce before you leave. Take-out is very easy - just ask for a lid for your bowl, and youre good to go.

Nice chill place. Youre in and then youre out - very quick, simple, and also very yummy. I recommend it!< /text>

The food here is good. The ingredients are fresh and the taste is spot on. Service is provided at a good clip even during the lunch time hour. Your have the choice of eating in the cozy restaurant dining area or just outside at one of the tables there. I don't think you'll be disappointed if you stop by.<//text>

I honestly wish they had a location where I live because the menu option is large and very reasonably priced. The food always taste great no matter if it's the steak and eggs breakfast or the sourdough bacon cheeseburger to the chili cheese fries. What I love is how there are many Mexican food selections on the menu along side American food. The best of both worlds! The staff are always friendly. I usually get my food to go but there is plenty seating for dining in. They also allow phone orders. I eat here every visit to LA - Norwalk.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Very good! My first visit and I was very impressed. The food is fresh and tasty, and there are just the right amount of options to satisfy every taste bud. The portion of the bowl is PLENTY. I was pleasantly surprised.
The server was not rude, but was not friendly so they need to work on some customer service.... But I will definitely return.< /Review>

<Text>The food there is phenomenal.  The ingredients available for their bowls is something you'll never find at your run of the mill Asian meat bowl restaurants.
I usually have the barbecue beef bowl.
The ingredients included, and the way they're placed in the the bowl, makes every bite a little different from the prior one. Every bite bursting with flavor. Great service, and they keep the place clean and tidy.
Highly recommended.< /Text><response>None<//response>< user_name>

But overall nice place, good combos and ingredients you can choose from, interesting flavors to add in. Could be fresher meats for the higher prices, often look a bit tired. Some things a little on the oily side.< /review>< gmapID>

<review>This place ROCKS!!! Absolutely amazing food! I work down the street and was fortunate enough to discover On + On. They give HUGE portions and it is not too pricey. The quality of the food is consistently amazing and you can tell it is all very fresh. What i love the most is that you dont feel “gross” after eating all their food.. you feel ENERGIZED and AWESOME!!! There is nothing greasy on their menu. My absolute favorite thing is the noodles with salmon, sweet potatoes, vegetables and PEANUT SAUCE! If i could give it more than 5 stars i would! All the employees that work there are so kind and polite. There is a reason why I will keep coming back here every week like i have been for a few months now. Great job, On + On!! You are killing it!!!< /review><name>Callie Fink< /name>< gmap_id>

They were out of two of the five protien even though the location was almost empty. They gave no timetable to wait just told us to pick another. Broccolli was raw and zuchini was cut into huge chunks. This place has promise this might be just a bad location or day.< /review>

<Review>I made a pit stop here after the lunch rush with my boss and i have to say the food is SUPER fresh even after the rush! We got a classic bulgogi bowl and i enjoyed everything. I may even prefer the vegetables over the meat. Try the kimchi brussel sprouts if you get a chance.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Prices start at 8 and up. Depending on the protein . They also have the choice of kimchi rice, steamed, and some type of brown noodle (forgot the name). Can also be ½&½ of salad .I will def return.. and return....< /review>< UserId.>

i eat lunch here a lot.   It is really fast and has low carb options.  It is also pretty inexpensive.  It is cafeteria style (Chipotle style actually where your bowl gets passed along to the next station) and they are really flexible.  If you say you don't want anything from one option set, they will put more in other some other item.</review>

The food is delicious but it is not a “$” it’s more like “$$”. The prices are vague and for two people in total we paid almost $30.< /text>

I LOOOVE this place!!  Healthy, fresh, deelicious & unique. And it's fast, the staff is SUPER friendly & courteous & it was CLEAN (that's a biggie for me).  Also like that both Norwalk & Torrance are easy in & out locations.  I just wish there were more!  I drove 40 min out of my way to go. (And that's rare for me!)  THANKS On+On!!!!</review>

< Review>
I first learned of On + On because it's Torrance location is close to work, and was happy to see they opened another location in Norwalk. It's like Chipotle in that you pick the components of your bowl at the counter. You get to choose one each of a base, protein, and hot veggie (you can also ask for half/half), and then you can pick as many of the rest of the cold toppings as you want. Everything I've tried is extremely flavorful. The bowl itself is huge and it's a great value because you can get easily full. I usually end up with leftovers. Even better, I feel guilt-free afterwards since it's mostly vegetables! The interior is spacious with ample seating. Parking is generally easy as well since it's in a plaza, though lunch hour sometimes is busy.</Review>

Its really good for one of the big three chains. Subtle sweetness to sauce, thick crunchy crust. I got a large 3 topping pepperoni and sausage and the toppings are fine. They made the pizza really fast, i walked there, about 10 minutes, and they had it done for me. Really nice people working there, i almost felt a real human connection, and thats rare. You should check it out.< /Text>

The cheese pizza is the best I've had anywhere. The crust is great and homemade. The combination pizza is my second favorite.<//text>

This location is EXTREMELY stingy on toppings. No exaggeration, I got 1 pepperoni, and 1 olive piece per slice of pizza, on a large. There were about 3 tiny spinach leaves on the whole pizza. Requested extra sauce on the pizza, and didn't get it. No Italian Seasoning, despite being the whole point of that particular specialty pizza.

Not coming back to this location.<//text>

<review>The pizza was soaked with something.  Not sure what. The taste was horrible.  It just didn't taste right. The meat seemed undercooked. The price of 21.99 for a medium pizza was ridiculous.  Never will I order from here again.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9cKpjhrQvl1CYPCRiR3DBwpbkwETjyV_Bl4D1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<Text>I just went in to get the two medium two topping pizza for supposedly 7.99 (each) I only wanted 1 so isn't it still supposed to be 7.99??? Each??? I'm confused bad advertisement if you can't buy 1 take out the EACH because therefore you HAVE TO BUY 2 FOR IT TO BE 7.99!!! Not each.....<//Text>< name>

Pizza quality very low, little flavor.

However, what was most disturbing was, during a pandemic, manager kept face mask below nostrils.  When I said something, he moved it up.

Watched pizza-maker touch the pizza without gloves.

Manager also had no gloves.  This is in a food manufacturing facility during pandemiic.

Secondarily, pizza was sitting for a while before they handed it to me (no other customers waiting).  Website was screwed up and was double charged me for 2 pizzas (only ordered/wanted 1).  Long conversation before  error was corrected.

So lousy pizza, very poor hygiene during pandemic, time-consuming correction for overcharge.<//Text>

Ordered pizza and wings, called after 40 minutes when pizza didn’t arrive, staff was rude saying they don’t have drivers so I asked for a refund. They refused and hung up.

Such franchisees give a brand such bad reputation unfortunately.<//review>

As a DoorDash driver, the speed of their delivery is impeccable. I have never had to wait over a couple minutes to receive the order I’m delivering, and the employees are quite determined and productive, even working nonstop without AC in 90+ degree weather. Big kudos.< /Review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Attempted to call and make a delivery order. Gentleman that answered the phone was rude through the conversation. There was obvious language barrier because each time I asked him if he could hear me now he very clearly said no I can’t hear you. I gave him my address multiple times and very slowly as to make sure he was getting and understanding each portion I gave him. He ended the first call with I’m not going to deliver their sorry and hung up. Second call to fry and speak with his manager about the situation went basically they same way. He couldn’t hear me but clearly responded to all my questions including that he was the manager and his name was David and to contact his corporate office I’d have to do it online and then he hung up.</review>< Pics>

They made the worse pizza I have ever tasted. They also cheat on the size of pizza. Each pizza is 2” smaller than what it’s supposed to be. XL should be 16” but is 14”. Large is 12 instead of 14.....
Staff barely understand and speak English. They are rude, never wash hands or put gloves on.</review>

<review>Excellent customer service at front counter.  Quick and fast.
It would of been a "FIVE STAR" until I saw
while I was waiting for our pizza.
I was watching pizzas being made for home delivery orders.  Employee had no plastic gloves on while making pizza's. This is ok but, never washed his hands. He would make pizza's take to oven, get toppings in back to put into his bins and continue making more pizza's.</review><Resp>None< /Resp>< username>

<Text>We live about 15 minutes from this location, hey by the time the pizza arrived it was warm, and thin crust was soft and kind of mussy and tough at the same time. Not at all appealing. Skimpy on cheese . Overall taste bland. Way overvalued . Got more flavor from a Digornio from the freezer. Pretty sad. Especially for the price, expected much more in quality and taste.</Text>< Pictures>

Made an online order and when I got there ALL of the staff literally ignored me for 10 minutes despite another employee yelling "customer in lobby" It got to the point where I had even yell and STILL I was ignored. Bad customer service experience. Would rather order elsewhere.< /Text>

<Review>This review isn't based on the food or the price. Some people like Papa John's, some like Dominos, some like Pizza Hut and most don't like any of the major chains.  (I actually prefer the taste Dominos personally)

This review is based on the service. I've ordered from this Papa John's numerous times and they've always brought my order way faster than I expected (20-30 min on campus on a week night, 25-35 at peak times). Pizzas always arrive piping hot and the delivery guys are all really friendly and professional.  When ordering a lot of pizzas for an event, Papa John's has always delivered right on time unlike some of the other pizza places in town.

The one time they messed up my order, they made it right when I complained.< /Review><Rating>5< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

<text>Pizza is so so, typical for fast food pizza places. And if you order online you might miss out on the coupons they often have at the store, beware. Other than that not much to say.... Typical boring pizza parlor.</text>< pics>

Awwful service!!! waited 1 hour when they said 30 min.  I specifically said call me when out side and never got a call. When i called back they put me on hold for 10 min to say that the driver called me and i did not answer. I never got a call from them. My husband was livid at this point and called for himself and they told him it was the drivers fault for not calling the correct number but had to talk to two different people first. This was my first and last time ordering from here.</Text>

<review>It’s always a great experience here. Everyone treats you great. Every time I come in here everything is explained to me whether it’s in the exam to details about how much my insurance covers. They also have a wide variety of name brand glasses, more than your typical lens crafters/America’s best.<//review>< rate>

Amazing service! I’ve been coming here for years and was referred by by best friend. The eye doctors are very professional and thorough and the patient coordinators are THE BEST!! Shout out to Nancy and Jessica for always being amazing, professional and patient! I always like to try on multiple styles and they are so kind and patient and their recommendations are the best. The rest of the staff is also fantastic!!< /Text>

{'time': 1597638835682, 'text': 'Hi Paul. In January, your order for new glasses was sent to your eye insurance laboratory in Sacramento. Due to your prescription and request for specific, custom lenses that your eye insurance does not carry, additional time was required by the insurance laboratory. We have no control over this process. Your eye insurance agreed with you that the time frame was too long , so they compensated you with a free pair of lenses. The COVID-19 pandemic delayed the insurance compensation process. Again, your second pair of lenses, at no charge, were made by your eye insurance in Sacramento. Please call us if you have further questions. Thank you.'}</Resp>
<text>After going to this place for over 5 yrs this year was the worst service I’ve had. My glasses took 8 weeks order in January  not done till March.  have done gone  back and forth for compensation. Finally got my compensation taken care July. I’m very disappointed in this service I had to pay for shipping of my glasses since they didn’t get them in time for pickup. I will be finding a new eye doctor. Horrible customer service.< /text>< GmapID>

So glad l came across this place and relied on thier reviews. I had a great experience. The staff is very efficient and professional. The doctor has a great bedside manner, she's thorough, explained my diagnosis and helped me choose the type of lens that would work best for me. I would definitely recommend this place. I liked it so much I made an appointment for my step daughter and my husband.<//Text>

Not very many selections for men there.  Also, the rep with the name that start with "M" was not very specific in non glare and glare features.

When we first spoke about the added features she mentioned anti- glare in which I thought it was primarily for night time from the headlights of vehicles.

When I picked up my glasses and tried them I told her that everything that sparkled or shine had a glare, she said is because I didn't get that feature and if I added it I would  have to pat over $90 plus Vs. the $60 because she already billed my insurance.

I told her I thought you meant anti-glare for the night time not for day time too or else I would have added them on.

After our conversation she completely ignored me and I left very upset!!!! No sense of atonement or empathy.< /text><Rating>1<//Rating>< response>

Dr. Sanchez has been my optometrist since he opened his office in Downey, about 10yrs ago. I continue to go back because of the level of friendliness & expert care. I remembered a conversation with Dr. S. when he first opened, about someday remodeling the office. Well they did it & it looks fantastic! Thank you Dr. S. & staff for being the example of what good care should be like.<//text>

Excellent customer service from both staff and doctor. Alot of variety to choose from. 👓
Very helpful on what glasses to choose from for our head shape and our style. Nancy explained in detail about the anti-glare lense and how they benefit me working on the computer all day. Definitely would recommend this place over Lens Crafters!<//Review>

<review>Super friendly staff, Nancy was very helpful and made the process very fast & comfortable. If you come here ask for Nancy she goes through the cases with you and makes looking for glasses easy, they have a wide selection of high end to more affordable grames. She also was very helpful with the lenes and recommend I pay a-little more for tech-shield/anti-glare which was never recommended to me in the past.  The Doctor was very friendly and advised i wait a-little longer for Lasik i really appreciated his advice on my contacts too. Overall it was a great experience i would highly recommended it. Not once did i feel pressured into getting frames i wasn't comfortable with Nancy was very patient.< /review>< Pictures>

< review>
They have nice variety of glasses, but the girl technician they have was very disrespectful towards me, she told me "you are too much and picky", I payed 400+ for a pair of Tiffany eye glasses and they need it to be adjusted and they just couldn't get it adjusted, when I tried them on they were perfect when I purchased them, but when they sent them to the lab for the prescritption lense, they frames got out adjustment. I'll never go back to them. I'm pretty sure I can buy my glasses somewhere else where I'm treated with dignity and respect. I had previously ordered another Tiffany Frame,  when I tried it in the store, it was perfect, when it came back from the lab,  they just couldn't get it aligned or adjust it, the guy technician they have was very respectful and politely told me that maybe I should choose a different frame, so I went ahead and decided to get a different frame. Unfortunately when I received the second pair of glasses this girl technician was extremely rude and disrespectful, I'm a costumer, I should be treated with respect, if they can't meet the expectations then change your area of work If you don't have good customer skills. Initially I had paid $20 more on the first Tiffany frame, and when I chose the second frame, it was $20 cheaper, but they refused to refund me the $20. Very unsatisfied, however I have to mention that the guy technician they have and one of the girls in the front ( I believe her name is Nancy), she was very polite and helpful,  versus that girl technician that was extremely rude, disrespectful and on top of that very argumentative. They can keep my $20. Just be aware that all their sales are final.<//review>

< Review>
Walk in and instantly greeted by staff explaining the menu, which is on the wall. The food was your average BBQ place you can find anywhere. The only difference I can find is the PECAN PIE!!!!

Great staff, high prices and carnival worthy bbq...<//Review>

Having lived in the south for a time, this IS the authentic taste! The location is in the heart of KoreaTown and short walk from metro transportation. Service is always friendly and fast. The food is always fresh and delicious. Make sure you try the voodoo sauce. There is beer on tap and you can even go home with a whole southern style pecan pie.
The location has benches for outside dining. The place is always kept clean. Bathrooms are stock and clean every time i go. Lunch specials are great. I always go home with a box.

This is a hole-in-the-wall, it is worth everyone's time to make a trip out to. You absolutely will not be disappointed. If you see the Boiling crab, you are in the right place!<//Text>< gmap_id>

<text>Each time I visit I would order the pitmaster special which is normally designed to feed two people. Not that I would finish it all but to have BBQ in front of you, I feel that it needs to be an overwhelming amount of deliciousness. Then you take it home for leftovers. The combination comes with 2 orders of meat, cornbread, a couple of sides and fresh greens. (combination changes daily)

Beef/pork ribs and brisket are good. Pulled pork is great! Can't say too much more as writing this review makes me want to have some today.< /text>< resp>

Best BBQ I've ever had in my life and I just got back from a Dallas trip a couple weeks ago. They also gave us an ENTIRE pork chop to test out as a new menu item (it was incredible). An absolute MUST try in K-town.< /Review>

Outstanding BBQ experience. We walked in with a group of 10 and they took great care of us. The food met my Texas bred expectations as did the friendly service.</Review>

There is still hope for authentic Southern BBQ in Los Angeles. That hope comes in the name of Boogie McGee's. This family-owned Mississippi style BBQ joint blew me away and made me forget I was in Los Angeles, surrounded by embarrassing displays of Buffalo wing serving "Southern Barbecue" restaurants. Everything is hand-made, family recipe prepared, and you can tell from the very first bite of juicy, tender brisket. Great prices, portions, and food make this my new go-to BBQ spot in LA.

-------Food-------
Brisket (5/5) - This is the money, the cornbread and butter of Boogie's. Incredibly tender and juicy, you can tell from the first bite that this cut was hand rubbed, slow smoked for 8+ hours, no corners cut. The crust on the outside is very well done - just spicy enough to penetrate the fat of the meat.

Beef Ribs (5/5) - To give you an idea of how tender these beef ribs were, as I was handing a rib over to my girlfriend, the bone completely slid out and fell apart from the meat. It's rare to find BBQ joints in LA that have beef ribs, and even rarer for them to be done properly. Cooked to perfection, and again the dry rub really added an extra element to the meat.

BBQ Sauce (4/5) - I had both the House Bourbon Classic BBQ Sauce and ​Voodoo Spice BBQ Sauce served on the side so I could try them both with the brisket and ribs. Both sauces have strong hints of bourbon to them which made the traditionalist in me frown. Although I wish they offered a more traditional smoky BBQ sauce, the meat is delicious enough on its own that I quickly forgot about my complaint.

Sides (3/5) - The corn bread was phenomenal - perfectly crispy on the outside and very fluffy on the inside. The dirty rice was also well done, and tasted very authentic. The cole slaw was too mind and seemed like it was missing something. With the combos, they also load your tray up with fresh veggies and a daily chosen side which in our case was Rotini noodles with diced vegetables in a vinaigrette sauce.

-------Staff (5/5)-------
Although Boogie McGee's is a walk-up & order joint, every single person I interacted with from the cashier to the cooks were kind, informative, and you could tell they genuinely cared about their craft.

-------Venue (5/5)-------
My girlfriend and I were the only people there at 5:30pm on a Tuesday. This place should be packed, granted it's a cute place tucked away in a Korea Town plaza, so it's probably the last result when searching for BBQ in the area. The quiet atmosphere actually made for an enjoyable dinner. They play country music and serve sweet tea - not much more you can ask for.< /text>

Seems like lots of people like this place, but I can't really see why.  This review is for half a rack of ribs with corn pudding and rice.

MEAT:  The meat did indeed fall off the bones, but sadly it tasted more like semi soft cardboard with a crust of peppery sweet rub. Maybe I'm one of the few who actually like to taste the juice of the meat rather than just sauce or rub.  The sauce itself, which was on the side, was not to my liking either.  Kinda like a sweet A1 sauce, in my opinion.  Gimme some meat juice!!

The rice was pretty good.

The salad was drenched with vinegarette which made the odd pairing even less appealing.

I DO love that they put lots of other veggies like carrots and green tomatoes, etc.

The corn pudding tasted ok.  It was also cardboardy, which made me check the cardboard it was on, but still edible.

The cornbread gets a dry 2.5/5.  Made me wish that Kenny Rogers chicken place was still around.  They seemed to have fresh, warm, soft corn bread with kernels inside all the time.

All in all, it was ok.  Luckily I work close by otherwise I would've complained about wasting money on parking too.

Maybe I got a bad batch?  It was 8:30pm and although they close at 10, it did seem like the lady who served me really, really wanted to just go home.  They did end up doing their closing routine at 9, so I just packed up and caught my train.  Hopefully this review can steer away only those like me, who like juicy meat, but also maybe give the owners a chance to review their methods.   Like I said, seems like other people love the place.

Happy eatings!

Oh yeah, i dig the country music and motif inside.  Thumbs up.< /review>

This place is amazing. Went there for the first time today after hearing about it on Diners, Drive In's and Dives!! I ordered the 3 count baby back ribs, the cheesy potatoes, the Cole slaw and the banana pudding. Everything was awesome. I'd recommend it to anyone. They even have a covered sitting area which most food trucks don't have.< /Text>

The food is great value and the staff is always super friendly. The potato salad is fantastic; I literally could eat it every day! There's platters available for variety and/or sharing, so I recommend getting one. Also, there's sinks in the back, just for handwashing. Prepare for a food coma because this food is delicious, artful, and colorful!<//review>< pics>

<text>I just discovered The Grove on my trip to CBS Studios because I have to park here! I have to say a huge parking garage with seven stories. Got into the mall and it was majestic, huge and refreshing!! There was a railway throughout the mall and a lot of stores! The environment was very clean and comfortable to spend the day! I'm definitely coming back to explore more about what The Grove has to show!</text>< Pictures>

What an awesome restaurant! I had the pork and brisket plate with south west coleslaw. The meat was nice and juicy and the sauce complimented the meat, rather than mask the taste. Not only was the food food, but it only cost me $12 for a two meat plate- why even bother with chipotle at that price? Very friendly service, too.< /review>

Hands down the best in Los Angeles that I have tried so far.  You can always tell a great spot through their brisket.  It melts like butter in your mouth.  2 meat combo comes with 2 sides and a ginormous salad which I barely touched because I was busy going thru the brisket, sausage, dirty rice, and cream corn.  Fantastic stuff!!!

You MUST try it!!!!!< /Text>< pics>

<Text>I highly recommend this place if you like barbecue! We usually do the 2-meat plate combo with Brisket and Beef Ribs. Both are delicious. The Potato Salad side was amazing and unique; it included bacon in it. The creamy corn was really good as well. The cornbread was hot and freshly made — probably my favorite side.

The service was great. The staff were all SO friendly and were very helpful since it was our first time here. They even gave us a free cornbread loaf (possibly because the cornbread was taking a little long, but we didn't mind) and a free side of pickled onions and jalapeños.

Even without the free sides we received, $40 for two meats, two sides, and a cornbread loaf is a really good deal, and more than enough for two people.

My one wish is that they should offer Mac & Cheese as a side. It was a bit strange to see a barbecue restaurant not offer it. 😅<//Text>< Pics>

<text>The food here was really good. And that's considering I came here pretty late in the day. The ribs were fall off the bone tender and seasoned perfectly. On top of this, the staff was way more than polite and helpful. I was running late to get my order for pick up, due to the less than ideal parking situation in the area. They called to check if I was still coming, even though I already paid and it didn't effect their day really. They offered to come and give it to me on the corner even. They were very nice about it.<//text><time>1545522675366<//time>< Rating>

The atmosphere is welcoming and fosters talking to the folks next to you. The food is AMAZING in flavor, generous in serving and priced like you're in the south instead of Los Angeles. The staff also made you feel welcomed like family, smiling, informing and attentive. I Can't wait to go back for some more Mississippi style smoked meats with awesome sides like coleslaw, potato salad, cornbread. My only desire was that they served wine since I Can't drink beer. But that lacking is not worth losing a star.< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Probably the best barbecue I've ever had. And I grew up in Mississippi, so that's saying something!

My wife and I went for lunch, and it wasn't too crowded. The menu has lots of typical BBQ fare to choose from.....but the food was anything BUT typical! We had a combo with three meats and two sides, and we got ribs, beef brisket, and pulled pork, with baked beans and cucumber salad. My wife and I are big eaters, and we couldn't eat but half of it! We got pecan pie and sweet potato pie for dessert--and the "slices" were a quarter of a whole pie!!! (And they were delicious.)

Turns out that the owner (with whom we has a 15-minute convo) is from the Miss. Gulf Coast, so he knows him some good barbecue, jack. And if you don't already love barbecue yourself, you will when you go to this place!</Review>< pictures>

<review>Brisket is king and rubbed ribs are it's queen. Tasty, well smoked, and fresh. Service is excellent. You could live off a 2 meat platter for 4 days if you weren't so greedy. The sides are fresh and abundant. Have of them you don't order, they just pile them on. This place is part of my trip every time I am in LA. They also serve Fred Flintstone sized beef ribs which every one should put on their bucket list. You will be glad you did. Yes, I told you so . . .<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

This place is incredible. I shared a three meat plate with two sides but the part that really made me happy, aside from the absolutely perfect meats, was the additional veggies they put on the plate. It's nuts. No one puts that much love on a giant platter anywhere I've ever been. Fresh brewed sweet and unsweet tea, perfect pecan pie, an awesome mix of country music and great service made this southern boy grin from ear to ear. This is my new favorite restaurant hands down.<//Review>

<Text>Best non-kbbq in LA, hands down. Best customer service and flavorful ribs. Creamed corn is super addictive as a side order. Highly recommend any of the beef items best.</Text><Date>1543040565224<//Date>< user_name>

The ribs were incredibly tender, the meat just fell off the bone.  The brisket was wonderful and plentiful and tender enough to cut with a fork.  The sides were great!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Brisket and BBQ sauces are great. The corn bread is sweet Wich is how I prefer it and it comes with honey butter. The baked beans were classic. We went on "wine Wednesday" so glasses of wine were only $3!</Text>

They even come back to the table and ask if you need anything else...  multiple times ! Did I say CLEAN?

This by far is AMAZING !!!  I love the mix of flavors bursting with distinct. Taste. I'm not a fan of mustard but boy do they do it  right . The staff was very helpful  and the chef    Was   Really interested. To see what I liked best . Comming from Hawaii im really stoked that I made this choice today.<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>The. Best. Bbq. I've. Ever. Had. As the great movie Friday after next feat ice cube once said, "BBQ so good, make you wanna slap your momma". I came here curious because I love BBQ but I hate driving out lol so I wanted to find a decent place nearby and I honestly didnt expect to be blown away but boy was I wrong. I ordered the brisket and was so surprised to see how I was able to cut it without using my knife much, the house beer goes so well with the food and makes you think about how well someone put this place together. I barely touched the sauce that it came with because I felt I didnt need it. The vegetables go so well with the food as well as the corn bread. I really like the table layout and the paper towel rolls are so cool altogether it gives it a very homey backyard bbq feel. Service on point. I look forward to becoming a regular and bringing my friends and family.</Review>< Pics>

Best bayou bbq i've had in LA so far.  One of the combo trays can feed 3 people!! Everything we had was good, and the woman at the counter was very helpful and nice.< /text>

This place has the best customer service and BBQ. The staff is very friendly from the moment you walk in. Having worked in the area for 10 plus years, it is great to finally have a BBQ spot that I wouldn't mind going to everyday. Delicious.<//review>

Piled high pulled pork sandwich, two sides of dirty rice and corn bread with drink, very tasty, all about $14. A taste of New Orleans bbq in LA.<//Text>

<text>Went here at lunch and the woman behind the counter was very rude. I was told that they were out of BBQ chicken, and I was literally the first person in the door.
When I asked the woman for a recommendation she said you can stand to the side while I help other customers. I then asked her how the ribs were, and she told me she would help me after the next customer.
Needless to say, I walked out. I found out on my way out from another customer who witnessed the whole thing, that the woman behind the counter was the owner.<//text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) I did not want to go there because I did not have enough people. It felt like it was not too much for the taste. Somehow, the surroundings are all Korean restaurants.

(Original)
사람이 너무 없어서 갈까 말까 하다가 1인분만 포장해서 먹었는데 맛있었습니다. 맛에 비해 너무 장사가 안되는 느낌이었어요. 아무래도 주변이 다 한국음식점들이라 조화가 안되는 느낌이긴 했습니다만</review>

Terrible service, had me waiting 23 minutes in different stations to pick-up a combo meal and to top it off when I got home the hamburger was 1/2 cooked, thoroughly surprised never had this poor service and food from a McDonald's I guess there's a first for everything. I'm done with McDonald's back to Wendy's where the food and service has always been excellent< /Review>

<text>I gave them three tries to not screw me over with my order and they failed all three times. First time I went later in the evening and received a completely wrong drive thru order that had sandwiches with no patty's inside at all. Just pieces of bread. Second time I ordered breakfast and received mcmuffins instead of mcgriddles. I gave them one last try tonight 5/28 around 8:30pm And received cold fries, no ice in drinks, and missing sauces to my BTS meal. I always give every restaurant I go to the benefit of the doubt but I can't give it three times in a row. There were 2 working managers and not a busy line all three times so there is no excuse. As someone who works in the food industry, this service is inexcusable. I will never return to this location because they can't get a simple order correct ever. And they don't answer the phones to correct any issues.</text><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

I love the McDonald's app, 99 cent large iced coffee everyday. I swing by here in the morning when I'm hungry to grab a couple egg Mc Muffins. The french fries are always good, the drive-thru line is pretty fast and there's usually plenty of parking at this one.< /text>

They have bad customer service here. They were bringing out other people's orders before mine and they closed down the lobby because they don't have enough employees. And they messed up on my hot latte three times and questioned if I ordered it correctly<//Review>

I normally do not eat at McDonald's, but I was up very early and wanted coffee, and something to eat, so I gave McDonald's a try by ordering their breakfast waffle and egg sandwich which was surprisingly great. So glad I gave them a chance by sampling a breakfast item.<//Text>

They WILL get your order WRONG!
This is the third time in a row I get my order wrong. I always have a little faith that they will get it right but always disappoint. I asked for Extra Onion and Pickles and they got it wrong the first time. I let them know and brought back a second order only to find out it was also wrong! I understand it is a fast-paced job but three times in a row from multiple people working there. Please re-train your staff or at least emphasize the importance of attention to detail.</Review>

Waited sooo long in drive thru , on my way home I found out my soda was only half way full and the sprite was flat. I drove back obviously and asked if I could get something else like chicken nuggets for the inconvenience and they said no. Got my money refunded. At that point the food I had ordered was cold.

<review>YOU ARE PAYING MORE MONEY PER ITEM HERE! DOUBLE CHECK YOUR RECEIPT!!! I really love their ice cream cones ever since I was a kid and McDonald’s was my to go place but guess what! I will NOT come back to this location! You would think that all Macdonald locations should charge you the same price! But you should double check if you are visiting this location! At first I thought the cashier charged me for 3 cones instead of two but when I checked the receipt I realized that they are charging $1.50 instead of the regular price of $0.99 that everywhere else charges. You would think it’s just $0.50 but if you take that and multiply it to the thousands ice cream cones they are selling each week you would see that they are ripping off way too many people and collecting a good chunk of money. There is no way they would have another dollar from me and I hope more people would read this review and double check their receipt!< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c2970e79b6817f:0xeba8a4b4b5edab79<//Gmap_id>< Name>

<Review>They are a franchise and the customer service is terrible they appear not to care, when you ask to add a sauce to the meal at the drive-thru they asked for 40 cents (no big deal) I ask for additional one at the window they suddenly asked for 60 cents I ask why the difference they "we are franchise not corporation".....what a shame< /Review>< Pics>

< review>
We came mainly for the burgers so this review will basically be all about that. There is no shortage of parking in the back and we came on a Monday, so it might be different than on weekends. The vibes were akin to an Irish pub with some plush seats at the walls.

Our group basically decided to get 2 Bacon Bourbonators and 2 Morrison Filets. All came with fries and one of my friends decided to get truffle fries for a bit extra.

Fries were crisp, and the truffle fries were good. No issues there, and definitely felt good having those.

As for the burgers, I think they were good but not as crazy good as some people make it to believe. The meat was tender and juicy, but I didn't feel that it justifies the price personally. Still, it was a good burger with few issues.

The drinks were fine. There's a huge selection of drinks that I can appreciate and the all IPAs that I had here were good.

Overall, a good spot for friends and even some family as long as it's a weekday, and while the burger is good I dunno if it's justified for the price.<//review>

Even before the pandemic, this place would not get the order correct about 50% of the time. My last visit took 2 trips through the drive through, I couldn't go inside to correct the order as they had locked the door due to guidelines, to get a correct order. There was no chance of a misunderstanding as I always ask them to repeat the order back, which he did. What I received however was 2 completely different meals with toppings I specifically asked to be removed. Second time around I received only 1 meal not the second.

This is a fairly busy McDonald's but that's no excuse for quality control. The other McDonalds in the area I've never received an incorrect order from. I won't be coming back to this one as I also get soggy greasy fries about 50% of the time on top of my order being wrong. Too much of a headache to deal with.< /text>

Not a good one in the Van Nuys area.
The food is meh. Usually dry and cold by the time you get it. Customer service is questionable. Speed with being positive is not something they worry about. I would rather find a different McDonald's or a completely different food establishment before ever going back to this location.<//review>

Horrible customer service.  Needed manager to discuss problem.  Cashier went to get manager and was gone for at least 3 minutes as people waited to place order.  Cashier comes back and says manager is now on 15 minute break.  Interesting how long cashier was gone (probably telling manager what I needed) and how very convenient of manager to suddenly leave on break and wouldn't be back for 15 minutes.  BS.< /Text>

I frequent this marvelous  place once a month  as I like the  special atmosphere that is part of this place. The staff is awfuly welcoming and skilfull. The service is awfully efficient. Not to mention, the food you eat is great. I came often and I was always pleased. The rate is decent. I suggest this place to my friends and family.< /Text>

Not sure why but everytime I go to McDonald's these days they never get my order right at the drive thru, even after I repeat it for them they always miss something, but the food is still the same as always</Text>

you have a sign that says carry out only, but you have to walk thru drive thru is very unsafe and embarrassing. no value and safety for your customers. you have all those workers inside have one stand outside and take orders!!!! re edit this place is a joke i ordered a nugget combo on doordash and i got fries and a hamburger<//review>

Used kiosk, not completely intuitive, someone came out to help, already figured it out, but I was thinking, why didn't they just take my order. Oh yeah, they would gotten it wrong again.

Quick service, food was fresh. Tasty as Mickey D's is. Not 5⭐'s but good for fast food that's fast.< /Text>

Good food and great coffee. I like how this location keeps both drive-through lanes open. It is a McDonald's, all I can ask for is good coffee and a warm breakfast sandwich. I am always pleased.</Text>

Service is bad... Food is just barely a pass. Some of the food is like undercooked for breakfast, the eggs more liquidy than solid. There usually are like 4 or 5 managers working and they take forever to temd to the customers. Waited about 20 minutes to get a 20 pieces nugget well done, with fries without salt and a hazelnut iced coffee. To which i saw the person preparing the coffee eat some of the ice... Wouldnt reccommend this mcdonalds to anyone</text>

Horrible I had to drive back a mile cause they didn't add meat to my big macs and they gave me an unnecessary apple pie to make me happy I denied the apple pie instead I ask for nuggets she said she didn't have any I gave the apple pie back I said then a cheeseburger it would be nice but she came back with 4 chicken nuggets 🤣🤣 I thought it was funny.  but oh well "UNNECESSARY "< /Text>

< Review>
I visited this location between 3-4am on my way home from work. Let's start off with the fact that the grill was being cleaned so they weren't serving burgers for the next 30 minutes or so. Normally this would affect my opinion in a negative manner but the way they handled the situation definitely deserves 5 stars.
I was only able to order chicken nuggets and fries but had originally come to pick up burgers. I'm not sure why but the drive thru line was taking forever so by the time I got to the window to pick up my food, it had been almost 20 minutes. I had asked the woman at the second window if the grill was back on yet since the guy that took my order said if I wanted burgers I'd have to wait 15-20 minutes. She apologized for the misinformation and informed me that it can actually take a little over 30 minutes. Making a long story shorter... This trip took me about 35 minutes but they did compensate me for the inconvenience and handled the situation in a friendly/professional manner.
This is also the only location, closest to Sherman Oaks, that is open 24-7.</Review>

<review>Every time I have visited this location, it has been really busy. But, even though it has been busy, the employees have been friendly, courteous and very fast. They go through the line quickly. I have been very impressed with their service. And they maintain their location very clean as well...at least every time I have been there, it was very clean.< /review><name>Rafael Cárcamo-V</name>< gmap_id>

If I could give half a star I would. I ordered 2 Caramel Macchiato and when I got to the window they repeated my order and only had 1 and I told them again that I had asked for 2, and when I received my order I only got 1 and I had politely told them I asked for 2 and they said they only charged 1 and I requested to pay for another and they said no. I had also asked for a SAUSAGE EGG MCMUFFIN and at the window I repeated myself AGAIN and got a ham and egg McMuffin???
TERRIBLE SERVICE.
Twice in a row... I went with my mom and my mother-in-law for coffee and they told us to park in the front and made us wait 15-20 minutes that i had to call them and when i called they said they were just about to make them and they came out bitter and sour and nasty. Please get better service here.< /Review>

In am done with this McDonald's location.  They either forget part of an order or they give you the wrong food. This is the closest McDonald's to my place, but I'd rather go out of my way to another location.  Never again!<//text>

Today like 20 minutes ego went to drivethru to ask for a Carmel frappe she told me the machine is not workimg like every night  so in the nice way I told her why they don't have any announce or paper to let people know about it the way people don't loose time waiting for something that they don't have it. And she start laughing about me in a very un respectful way .</text>

Avoid this place. We bought fries it was so oily and bad. My son had an upset stomach after eating couple of them.
We drove back to ask for a refund. She was so mean didn’t even say sorry.
Worst customer service and worst food.</review>

Terrible customer service.  Kiosks didn't print receipt and staff responds was they didn't know how to fix it. Was not helpful at all.  Then my order took extra long and I had no receipt to track my order number.  When my order finally came, they forgot my drink and sauce for the nuggets.</Text>

This is out local McDonald's and the best thing about it that it is open 24 hrs which makes it easy for me to get my coffee at 5 am everyday. I love their coffee and their pies.</Review>

The staff is very friendly and greeted me with a smile. It's very clean and I found a place to sit without an issue. Most items on the menu are fairly priced. The restrooms are clean. Parking lot isn't that ample and I had trouble finding a spot.</Text>

<text>Went through the drive-thru and was told I needed to wait for my food to be "prepared fresh," which sure, fine, whatever. After 10 mins, they brought out my food, buy they brought the wrong thing out (chicken strips and a medium fries instead of my two hamburgers and small fries). I was told to wait again. Waited another 10 minutes and went inside where I was told I got had already gotten my food. Waited another 10 minutes and finally got what I'd ordered. What a waste of time.<//text>< Pictures>

I asked for mc chicken with very little mayo. The guy who helped me especifically repeated to the server. Once i get my sandwich it has a lot of mayo. And when I approach the manager I assumed bc of the way she was dressed she was not that nice. She asked for a new sandwich but I waited about 10 mins for it and I had to double check if it was ready. Till then i got my food. Not satisfy with this visit at all.<//review>< Name>

I think their egg McMuffins are tasty and for the price you can't go wrong.
As far as the help that struggle with the English language, you have to give them credit, they are earning money to survive. There are two types of people, the ones that care, and the ones that don't care. These are people that give their all.<//text>

This place is just like any other McDonald's except better. The dinning room is open late and the drive through all night. avoid after school hours though, it gets full.<//Text>

If I could give this location a zero I would do that!!! Their service is terrible and they dont even know health standards for food service
I went thru the drive-thru and they made me park, we waited for 20min and when they brought the food they had handed our food to another customer, and then the girl that took the food back had attitude because I didnt want to take the bag of food she had just received back from another customer!!! They do not understand that a huge HEALTH HAZARD!!  Seriously!!!??? Incredible horrible place!!< /review>

Good, clean spot. Music was on a little loud though so I couldn't take my conference call as planned. The WiFi doesn't work either. Not a great location to work remotely like I usually do at McDonald's<//Review>

<review>I asked for a grilled chicken sandwich, they stated that they were out of grilled chicken but they had crispy chicken...That's cool too, I didn't mind. I got home and when I was getting ready to eat my sandwich I noticed it wasn't crispy chicken but instead it was grilled. I don't know as to why but I decided to open my sandwich to find that is was raw meat..... I threw it out and would not recommend this McDonald. It's a waste of time and money. Not cool.....McDonald<//review>< pics>

3 employees doing nothing. Rerouting you to the kiosk to order, have to come and help because the thing doesn't work, go back to the register and order. When I could have ordered at the register with no problem.</Text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>I usually go here once a week for a late night homework session. I usually need WiFi to do that because of all of the necessary research. I just order a meal, pick a corner, pop a squat whip out my laptop, and go at it for at least 3 hours straight. I usually then order desert and continue. The staff never bothers me and don't seem to have a problem with me being there for a while. Maybe it's because I am polite and don't cause any problems. I wish that this McDonalds was open 24 hours a day, but I understand why not if the reason is the particular area. The only thing I really have a problem with is the cleanliness of the place. The bathroom needs to be checked more often and dining room needs to picked up constantly, but rarely is. Aside from that, the staff is great!</Text>< rating>

Horrible!!! After waiting a long time in the drive thru, we finally got to the pickup window.  We were then asked to wait at the front, which we did for nearly 10 minutes. We were given a bag, and once we arrived back to the office,  it was a wrong order. This location is not well run,  not the first incident here.

UPDATED 8.30.19

I have an autistic child who loves McDonalds, otherwise there is no reason to go here. They are slow as can be, and no matter how long you in the drive thru, you are told to 'move out front'. It has been at least a dozen times in a row where we did not get the food at the window. And because they tell nearly everyone to do this, there are many times there is no place to wait, one time there were EIGHT cars waiting for food. The management must be grade schoolers, no way adults would let this happen for years.<//Text>

This McDonald's is the worst one. If I wanted to get coffee that taste like dirt I would drink the one that drips out of it when cup when they over fill the cup. The waiting time to get your food is like waiting in the DMV. Well at least the cashiers can listen and get your orders right or can they? My answers would be that I rather teach a wild dog to listen to me correctly.< /Text>

<review>Most awful experience. The entire order was wrong. They were upset with our pointing out we ordered an oatmeal cookie not oatmeal. The air-conditioning was blasting so hard it was uncomfortable to be in there for five minutes. For some reason one of the big Macs had the cheese burger buns. No seseme seeds. Run don't walk away from this McDonald's</review>< Pictures>

I get this is just Mc Donald's so I shouldn't have high expectations but people come here when they need something fast. That's why it's called "fast food" so if I wanted to wait 25 minutes for my food, I would've made it at home myself or gone to an actual restaurant! It look me about 10 minutes to actually get to the speaker to order my food through the drive thru, another 5 minutes to get to the window just for the guy to tell me to go park and that they'd bring my food. The parking lot was full so where were they supposed to find me?!?! 10 minutes later no one came out and I eventually got fed up , walked inside and asked to speak to the manager. I told her about my experience and the whole time she had a look in her face like she could give a damn what I was saying (which doesn't surprise me). I've worked in customer service since I was 16 and because of that I can easily say these workers have no sense of urgency and it seems like they have no idea what they're doing since they had to ask me THREE times what my order was when I walked in! No matter where you work, you're getting paid to do your job. SO DO IT RIGHT!</text>

<Text>Great interior décor and good food. The exterior is the new design 'where there is of course ample parking' . But.... Unfortunately all too often the lobby smells like it was mopped with the same mop used to clean up a restroom explosion. Really reeks of sewage in the afternoons.<//Text>< pics>

There is just something weird about the staff here. The food is eatable mostly, it is mc Donalds after all, cheap, quick, and not so nasty it will make you puke. Still it is more of a mad scientist project rather than nutrition.< /Text>

< review>
First, i had to repeat my order to the young lady 3 times through the microphone only to get to the window and my order was still wrong--3 double cheese burgers, no pickles with mayo. Then i get to the second window and they made me get out of line to park my car because they didnt have my order ready. Waited for 5 minutes and then my food was ready. Ive held my tongue long enough about the service at McDonalds. I enjoy the food, but their service has sucked A** at almost everyone i've been too. So moving forward, i'll be leaving reviews for ever single one I visit. Good or bad, there will be one.</review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>This one of the worst McDonald's I've had the displeasure of visiting... and that's say A LOT considering how bad the everyday service at most of these fast-food restaurants are. They don't listen to your order, catch an attitude when you tell them you got the wrong order, and then STILL get it wrong when they give it back to you a second time.

I know these are minimum paid workers and most of them don't care, but WOW. The employees at this place take that to a whole nother level! Please use your GPS to find a McDonald's at another location, this one is truly bad.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Worst service that I have  ever experienced at a fastfood restaurant. I waited 45 mins for my food because it had made fresh . They didn't even acknowledge or apologize for the wait . Service like this make me wonder how dumb u have to be to work here.</review>

They have remodeled this place not too long ago maybe 2 years or so it is much better than it was before. It is corporate owned and not franchise and I really do enjoy the corporate owned McDonalds as they are not so stingy with all their condiments and napkins like the franchise ones are.< /Review>

<text>Just went through the drive through. When I placed my order their screen was shut down so I was not able to varify it. When I arrived at the first window the girl asked me if my order included a hash brown and a coke. I told her "no" and proceeded to tell her my correct order. When I get to the 2nd window, I get handed a coke, a hash brown, and my partial original order. Except that Instead of fixing her mistake and giving me a "Ice cream cone" I drove away with two unnecessary drinks and without my ice cream or caramel sundae. I'm beyond displeased with the customer service of both ladies at the window.< /text>< gmap_id>

Ridiculous. Service based on color or homelessness. Even went as far as to post a sign saying dining is only allowed 30 min..then you get the boot..trust me..they follow these ridiculous rules. Ive had to stop there to eat (unfortunately! & not by my choice) here and there over the past 2 years and left speechless each time! If given the choice..find another McDs!< /text>

Food is always the same. Prices have gone through the roof! No $1.00 menue. Drive-Thru is prority. Inside & Eat-In orders can take forever. At night, tables are dirty. Many times I have cleaned my table with napkins & water as employs. watched!</Review>

Horrible. It usually is. Drive thru is 15 minute minimum wait. By the time you get your food it's cold. I'm not returning to this particular McDonald's. The staff are usually very friendly on the other hand.< /Text>

< Review>
A lot of people on here are worried about them not treating the homeless good but the reason why they kick them out is because other customers go and complain to the  manager that they’re uncomfortable with them inside the restaurant . Anyway I love this restaurant, I always com here after school because Im admired by so many teenagers that go to school and still have to put up with some grown ups that make they’re life miserably at work .<//Review>

This location is by far the worst I have ever visited the problem is that they always mix up the orders with other peoples orders and you have to go back and wait for them to correct it the people operating the drive trough are for the most part rude, I cant really say the same about the cashiers window but the pick up window always make you wait around the front for at least five minutes, It defeats the purpose of going trough the Drive trough they always want to charge for any extra sauce, Jack in the box, burger king and other places don't charge for extra sauce.< /text>

(Translated by Google) I waited about half an hour in line and when he got to the window they told me that I have to go to park to give me my food, what terrible service and worst of all, like three blocks There was another McDonald's that I think would have been better

<rate>1</rate><Text>(Translated by Google) The staff is uncooperative. Apparently they need someone to guide them to the goal, in this case the clients. I went to the car service and they sent me to wait in the parking lot. I didn't get my order until I went to get it at the counter myself. Just because I had already paid. After several purchases until today, October 28, I received some frape drinks that are just crushed ice. It is better to buy a scrape from the lord of the wheelbarrow. Mc Donald's Kester and Victory attend lousy.

(Original)
El personal no esta cooirdinado. Al parecer necesitan alguien que los guie al objetivo, en este caso los clientes. Pase al auto servicio y me enviaron a esperar al parqueo. No obtuve mi pedido hasta que yo misma fui por el al mostrador. Solo por que ya habia pagado. Luego de varias compras hasta hoy 28 de octubre e recibido unas bebidas frape que son solo hielo triturado. Resulta mejor comprar un raspado con el señor de la carretilla.

<Review>(Translated by Google) It is a place that looks clean, the attention is somewhat careless, they are very focused on personal group conversations and they ignore the clients a lot, and something very special they do not have soap to wash their hands, the dispenser is completely broken, this means that yes An employee makes use of this (bathroom) will return to work with dirty hands, (contaminated) try to make it known and as I said before they do not pay attention to customers, try to speak and they simply ignored my presence at the cash registers.

(Original)
Es un lugar que luce limpio, la atención un tanto descuidada están muy centrados en conversaciones personales de grupo he ignoran mucho a los clientes, y algo muy especial no cuentan con jabón para lavarse las manos esta completamente quebrado el dispensador, esto quiere decir que si un empleado hace uso de este (baño) regresará a su trabajo con las manos sucias, (contaminadas) trate de hacerlo saber y como dije anteriormente no le prestan atención a los clientes trate de hablar y simplemente ignoraron mi presencia ante las cajas registradoras.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The lady who attended me repeated the order and I did not listen well because she was giving me another's order and I paid when the order was corrected the person in charge of it was upset and rude, despised and spoiled and closed the window on my face and He told me that it was my fault and gave me the impression that customers do not care that a place that is not recommended and not friendly is not the first time that something similar happens in the same restaurant, rating (- 10) the worst

(Original)
La señorita que me atendio me repitio la orden y no le escuche bien  por que me estava dando la orden de otro y pague cuando corregi la orden la encargada de ella se moleste  y fue grosera despota y malcriada y me cerredo la ventana en la cara y me dino que era mi culpa y  me dio la imprecion que no le importavan los clientes un lugar poco recomendable y no amigable no es primera ves que pase algo igual en el mismo restaurante ,calificacion ( - 10 ) lo peor< /Text><GmapID>0x80c2970e79b6817f:0xeba8a4b4b5edab79</GmapID><rating>1</rating>< resp>
