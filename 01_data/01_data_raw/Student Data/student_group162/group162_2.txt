I had a very pleasant experience in this place! The food was great and well delicious!!! We ordered seafood and lamb tandoori, and shrimp and seafood curries. Everything was above our expectations. The place itself looks fancy with Pacific railroad train inside and some tables outside. Very friendly, so I do recommend to try it if you are in Sebastopol.< /Text>

<Text>Delicious food! This was the first time I have been inside this building - in the 40 years I have lived near Sebastopol - and found it fun to eat inside this restaurant as a first. The waiter was super friendly, it was cozy and warm, and the service was great. I got the Veggie dish (pictured) which came with soup. I enjoyed a taste of Nepalese food as it satisfied my one-in-a-blue moon mood for Indian food without all the heavy spices. The veggies were all cooked nicely, and the sauce was very tasty. Loved the mango dressing on the salad. A nice array and flavors and nice atmosphere to match! :)< /Text><Response>None</Response><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQ4U3GVrWaq7PjUyi1dQSlqgAMhHFkkwvWv1L-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYJ55Yr8aRLCrzQsJ-2msSh4vHplkbJqloji4o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlK8FLKLTel3DaX-Y8paD7tY0cLQRyhJglE760=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< username>

Holy moly this restaurant is amazing. My partner and I tried this place because we were evacuated from our home and felt that we deserved some comfort food. We ordered take out and it was ready quickly. I think the price point is amazing for the portion size and the flavors are out of this world. We were so impressed that we have been back twice in one week. I plan on visiting this spot regularly as I have loved everything I have tried. Great staff, great food. You will be sad if you don't put this food in your mouth.</text>

<Review>My mouth is watering thinking about the Chicken Tikki Masala combo and garlic naan we happily devoured yesterday. We stopped at this place to grab a bite on our sunset bike ride. It kept me warm and happy for the remainder of our cold ride back home haha! The food is fresh, quality, comforting, and tasty. I’m already thinking about what I want to order next!<//Review>< userid>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>What in the world just happened? I got a doordash from here. There were no utensils, or napkins, no sauce that went with the overly salted vegetable fritters. The Nann was so chewy it was like chewing on leather. The vegetable curry tasted fine but was the wrong curry, they gave me an entirely different dish. I called with my concerns and was told to come by for a refund. I thought that would be fair as I wouldn't be eating it. When I got there the lady told me there was nothing wrong with the Nann and aggressively threw it in the garbage can? Then she picked apart the rest of the food and said I ate too much to get a refund. That was a huge exaggeration as I literally tasted everything except for the brown rice. Long story short she tried pushing her gift check for the $30 refund on me that was already written out upon my arrival mind you showing me clearly she never intended to  refund me. I told her that I wasnt trying to offend her but didnt like the food so didn't want the ticket to more of this horrendous experience.  She literally yanked the money from the drawer and threw it at me. When she did that I called her a not so nice name and SHE CHARGED AT ME! I'm still in shock at this experience.  I dont know what challenges they are facing there but please understand MOST OF US ARE. NOT OKAY TO ATTACK PAYING CUSTOMERS<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Cute location, great food! The saag paneer is the best I’ve had! Momos are also a must. Easy takeout during covid and not too much plastic. So many veggie options!< /Review>

Delicious, family-run spot! Highly recommend the veggie momos, and the squash saag was also fantastic. Plenty of vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options. Perfect place for a lunch stop on our way up to Mendocino.<//review>

Food is great. Closing at 830 even on weekends in the summer is absurd. Came here once w open sign on a little past 830...Tonight got here at 8:27 and almost got turned away. Finally realized they close at 8:30. It’s bright outside. Summer hours maybe!? Just a thought.<//Text>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>The food and the staff are fantastic. I found the portions to be generous and the flavors to be great. The only reason for the 4 star rating is that I found the train car atmosphere to be pretty claustrophobic. It wouldn't be so bad if the windows opened up to some kind of view instead of a dark hallway and parking lot. I'll definitely be back but most likely for take out.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808430a6211d1f0f:0x8d1b4c6fbeeaf05</gmapID></record>

Very good food - more Indian than Nepalese. Excellent service. One of the better meals on a 10 day holiday on the West coast. Dining room is a little cramped, but luckily food made up for that. In nice area, next to Sebastopol Inn.< /text>

<text>I really like their food, but the service is so slow. I have come in somewhat bigger groups (6 to 8) but it still takes over 30 min to take order and it was over 45 to get food! I wish they would dial in service so I could give them 5 stars and I would go more often! Especially bc my vegan friends really like it and it's easy to get vegan stuff at restaurants that serve this style of food.
The red wines they have are really well priced and yummy. I love the garlic Naan, the soup appetizer, and their seafood specials are always done well!!</text>< pics>

Delicious, fun place to eat. You sit & eat in a vintage train car. It is a family run restaurant and the service is great.
They offer many vegetarian dishes as well as chicken, lamb, and fish. They also offer white rice, brown rice, and quinoa. The masala chai is so good and you can sweeten it to your own taste.
I will definitely take friends, and family to this charming and very good spot.</review>

Vegetarian only, very flavorful and well cooked, nothing soggy or underdone. The waitress was super sweet! This is a small restaurant so groups of 4+ will not be as comfy, they also close at 2:30 to reopen later. If you like chai tea Himalayan style this place serves it just right!!!!< /text>

Disappointed that this once acclaimed vegan organic restaurant now serves meat.  Flavors are still great, my favorite vegan dish is still on the menu, but I'm not promoting it anymore or going much.  The reason I still do occasionally go is because they substitute quinoa instead of rice.</text>

Fantastic food. My second time here and it didn't let me down! Very nice, balanced lentil soup, delicious veggie quinoa birjani. Highly recommend it! Worths a drive from San Jose for certain!</Text>

<Review>Love to eat here. Services are spot on. Polite and prompt. Happy to suggest options. Hamburgers are so good juicy yummy. Love the pancakes. Coffee is hot and plenty. OK bad is they always very busy. But worth the wait. Try the great salads.</Review><GmapID>0x809143a601a65223:0xbd1c5c71643992e8< /GmapID><rate>4</rate></record>

<Review>I rented a uhaul using their 24/7 option. I called the office to ask if I could change the pick up time to something much earlier. Francis was so kind and helpful. The staff made the whole process so easy and stress free. I will absolutely be renting a uhaul from this place in the future, when the occasion calls for it.<//Review>< pictures>

Picked up a U-Haul earlier this week. This location has always been excellent the demotion to 4 stars was really not their fault as U-Haul had a major outage and had no way to know that we had a reservation or, once the computers were back, that this location had the unit available. This left us uncertain whether we would get our trailer. It also resulted in slow service made worse by one employee had just been hired and could do only limited things.</Text>

<Review>Very impressive! Miguel, the young man who helped me was amazing. I really did not know what I wanted, and he stayed with me the entire time guiding me to the proper size and His customer service was top-notch. Then when we checked in he again stayed with us and made sure everything was perfect. The place is clean and well organized. I highly recommend this place< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1606576665328, 'text': 'Thank you!

I just signed up for a unit at the Palm Desert location. The gate entry code I was given did not work. When I tried to inform someone by using the intercom button, it didn't work either. I called their phone number and was told the intercom hadn't been working for some time. (So why not FIX IT?)

The agent told me to wait a minute then he came back and said to try again. This time it worked. He was helpful when I asked for a different unit that would be easier to roll my motorcycle into.

By the time I left it was after office hours. I pulled up to the gate thinking a sensor would detect my car and open the gate. Nope. I called their # but had to leave a voicemail asking how to get out. I finally walked out through the door in the gate, entered my code to open the gate & got back in the car and left.

I have never received a callback from my voicemail to see how I got out or explain the procedure.</Review>

This is security function to ensure only current tenants are able to access our location.  The temporary code the team was able to provide was for that day only. When driving to the exit gate, your code should be entered again to open the gate, again another security function.  We have gate keypads on both the incoming and outgoing driver’s side – so you can just do it from inside your car when you pull up to the gate. The “lip” at the door of your unit, that the motorcycle had to roll over, is to provide a better seal when the door is closed so that there is protection against rain, rodents, and any other hazard. I am glad the original unit was still able to work.'}< /response>< Gmap_id>

We’ve had storage units at Security Public Storage in Palm Desert for almost a year, and have been very pleased with their customer service. Jaclyn and Shea are great. Whenever we have had questions or concerns they listened to us and, if necessary, took appropriate action to resolve them. Thank you both.< /text>

We have had an excellent experience using Security Public Storage.  Shea was great in helping us through the setup process.  She was patient and knowledgeable which made it so much easier.  The location is so convenient and we love the fact that we can drive in and park directly in front of our unit.  Both Shea and Miguel were great.</Review>

Andrew was awesome in getting me squared away with my storage unit.  I went in for a standard 10x10, but he was able to suggest a non standard size that actually worked better for me and saved me money every month in the process.  Quick and easy process to get the stuff out of my house and organized into storage.  I do recommend Security Public Storage.  PS:  They also helped me with a trailer.  A+ A+ A+<//review>

<review>I have had a storage bin here for a long time and the staff has always been friendly and helpful. The site is well maintained. This is the first time I have posted a review.The only difficulty I had was when my credit card was expiring and I faxed in my new credit card and expiration date on the form provided by them and somehow or other the new credit card was not applied and I was notified that I had not paid. It was straightened out eventually and it seemed some type of internal company procedures caused the mix up.  But it did have me concerned. Other than that I think Security Public Storage is very good.<//review>< pictures>

<text>We have been here for almost a year, and I have to say they are the most honest storage places we have ever dealt with. The managers in the office are always on top of everything and are so nice! The cost is fair for what you get, and one of the cleanest I've seen. The property is older, but I would go here over one of the chain places any day.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

After all the nightmare stories I had heard about storage facilities, I was amazed at how easy Security Public Storage is to work with!  They held my reservation with no deposit until my move-in time.  They have a friendly staff who is incredibly helpful, always cheerful; they are in a good location with easy access and so large that there is a good selection of sizes available.  I rented a large space until I can downsize, and then will move what is left to a smaller space where it will stay until I no longer need the storage.  I highly recommend Security to anyone needing storage.</text>

She was very detailed and explained everything to us. They have excellent rates as well! It is kept very clean and organized and very easy to get to.

I've been renting a climate controled space for a year now and am frequently in and out of the unit.  It's an interior unit and it's always clean and cool inside.  The grounds are also always clean and I feel very safe at any hour I need to be in there.  The staff have always been friendly and easily accessible by phone or in person.  I would recommend this place to anyone.</Text>

My family and I are long time clients of the Palm Desert store. We commend them for their expert customer service, very clean, facilities and fair pricing. I would recommend Public Storage to anyone with storage or moving needs.

Sincerely,

Friendly front office. Operationally,not so good. It took them 2-3 months repairing climate control in the P building, during summer. Gate access sketchy since August, and now,its in-op.</Review>

This place is Great!
Reserved my space ahead of time and they were ready for me when I arrived. They were very polite and professional and the space was excellent, clean, easy to get to and fully air conditioned and protected against the desert sand and they had a large dolly available for me to use. The space was reasonably priced and  is very close to Sun City Palm Desert for those who live there.< /Text>

<Text>First, we'll start with the personnel who greet you. Dana and Robert are great! They are so professional and knowledgeable with no pressure what so ever. Maureen and I selected an air conditioned unit which certainly made sense to us especially in 100+ degree weather. Today we extended our lease and it took all of two minutes. When they use "Security" in their name they really mean it -- the first entry I made on the premises I followed the car in front of me through the gate without entering my code. Within  a minute of entering my locker there was an employee checking me out to verify who I was, pretty impressive. Thanks SPS for your help and just being friendly people.

I've only been with Security Public Storage for a couple of months now, but since then, their service and explanation of how their facility works and operates was clear and concise.  Their rates seem to be equal or slightly below others in the area and the entire facility is clean and well maintained.  So far no complaints by me.<//review>

We have had 2 storage units with SPS and appreciate the clean facility and outstanding service from the the gentlemen at the office, they are very knowledgeable and on the ball!!
We were immediately taken care of both in the office and then as we personally taken to the storage unit.
Clean and air conditioned.
We continue to store our contents with Security Public Storage.

Thank you. Diane Clervi</review>

Very helpful and friendly staff, and security as stated in their name is one of their huge pluses. Someone on site 24hr a day. (To monitor the facilities wellbeing not for regular operating hrs services) large gate that requireds a password in and out and alarms on every unit. It's not the cheapest but you get what you pay for.< /text>

My husband and I just moved to Bermuda Dunes a month ago, and quickly found Security Public Storage. We weren't sure at first if this was the right storage place for us, and we've used other companies in the past. We talked to Robert on the phone, and once we heard that the managment lived on site, and that each unit has it's own alarm.....we were sold. We went down immediately to look at the units, and the service we received from Robert and Brenda was unparalled to any other service I've ever received at a storage facility. They were friendly, quick to help us, and most of all; up front about all costs. There were no hidden fees which we LOVED. I would strongly recommend this facility.< /text>

<Text>Moved to concord 5 years ago so I’ve been going to this GameStop since but recently changed due to the digital game and poor customer service within the store I came with my kid to purchase an item and when I asked to see item to analyze and figure if it was the right one the lady behind the counter would not let me touch any equipment<//Text>< Pics>

This is one of my favorite store...close of my house... guy's are great... excellent customer service...but a few months ago I bought GTA on pre-order...before the supposed pandemic...and then... when I was supposed to play my game? the disc did not recognize the game ... it was scratched

￼

. okay...I'm still waiting for return my game. I know that always in business not everything is perfect, because I work in a business. I just hope they can change it for me, and, for the next time, I hope the same thing doesn't happen okay? 👍<//Text>

<Review>I had bought a few used games from this store. And I wanted to return them as credit towards the new Black Ops III game and they told me I needed a receipt. I live in fairfield and it wouldn't be wise to drive back to get them.. isn't that what my power up rewards are for? To track these kind of things? All I'm saying is that this location is not customer friendly. . And the manager Jason wasn't compliant.</Review>< Time>

I haven't shopped at a GameStop in years and after coming in to buy a "new" game I remembered why. This place always has a flea market shadiness feel to it and the employees are trained to make light of any concern you have of its shadiness.

I checked online to see if a game for my son was available at this location. It was, awesome. I headed on over and asked for it. They asked me "new or used?" I wanted a new one since it was on sale and cheaper than their advertised used one. The employee comes back with an opened game and tells me it is new. Two employees are involved now trying to reassure me it is new and the reason it was opened was they had to have a box on display and this was the last one. Of course neither of them realized there was another box on display. They then told me they could shrink wrap it up if I wanted. The booklet inside was a little roughed up and there were fingerprints on the disc. Where else can you go where they push un-boxed, opened media to you and sell it as new? Oh yeah, a flea market. The employees thought there was nothing wrong with this practice which lets me know this is a trained tactic.

Avoid this store and tactics like this, I would recommend going to a big box stores instead. A store with selling ethics like GameStop does not deserve our money. You can always go to a flea market, Craigslist or ebay for used games.</Text>

The guy there was awful. Very rude and wouldn't allow my friend to purchase the game he wanted, even thought he was 17 and had the money he needed because of the fact that he "might" give it to somebody under the age of 17. Would not recommend going to this one.<//Review>

I'm 17 and recently tried to purchase Watch Dogs 2 from here. These two asshats started asking me for my ID. I told them I was 17 and didn't have an ID yet. They told me I wasn't able to purchase it unless I had an ID or a parent there for permission. Undeniably the worst GameStop, I have ever seen.< /Review>

For Christmas 2014 we welcomed home our brand new baby PS4. She joined her siblings in our living room: the Atari, NES, SNES, Xbox Kinect, and a couple less popular little ones. She fit right in! We started with two games, but grew weary of GTA, and beat The Last of Us in just over a week. Time for a new game!

My husband wanted Far Cry 4, so we first checked Phoenix games, wanting to support a local shop, but they didn't have it. We entered GameStop and they told us they had a used copy for  $55. The employee searched the disorganized store but was never able to locate the used copy, so we bought it new for $60. Not much of a price difference anyhow.

My husband commented that their store was very unorganized but the employee just commented that it was the holiday time. All the more reason you'd want to keep it put together, you'd think - lots of shoppers right now... oh well. Got the game - and it's awesome!!!< /text><name>Amy Palmer</name><Date>1420789807771< /Date><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>Horrible place where the employees try to rip you off. Wanted to buy a game new and some lady said they had one copy left that is new. bought the game without the wrapper (strange but didn't do notice), but when i checked the cd when i got home, it was scratched and in obvious used condition. watch out people. when gamestop says that they have only one copy new it's usually a used copy so they can over charge you for a used game.

edit: i just wanted you dumbasses to know that your business is deceptive and the people who work here are con artists.<//text>< Time>

<review>I visit this park almost every day: weekdays for picnic lunch, and weekends for parties and hanging with friends. Great vibes, beautiful city views, and fun relaxed people. This would be the greatest park in the world if they could do something about the bathrooms - 2 toilets for thousands of people, many of whom are drinking beer? Forget the 1 hour lines, most of the guys just piss on the side of the restroom building or go down the hill to the train tracks. The stench of urine ruins an otherwise lovely experience.</review>< Pics>

There's another park at Valencia and 19th. I have hung out in this park. Tourists in town love it. Visitors love it. People who think they are hip like this park, but it's alright. It's a bit too gritty in the Mission and it seems infested by something. There's a big scene and you can see and be seen.

It also has a ChargePoint station if you have a plug in electric car. It’s a great little picnic nook and it has an access point to the LA River. If that’s all you want in a little neighborhood park, then this park is great.<//review>< userid>

Park is accessible from the LA River Walk.  The facilities are fairly new, including flush toilets.  There is a circular dirt track around the park with free exercise equipment.  There are benches and picnic tables and a large grassy area.  There is access to a skate park at one end of the park.  On the other side of the skate park is a park area with a children's playground.  The walk along the river has a two-way bike path in the middle with narrower paths on each side.  There is a walk-in or bike-in entrance to the river walk on Fletcher Drive, just north of Gilroy.  Less than 1/2 mile east of that entrance is access to the larger section of the park.<//text>

I am very pleased with the work No Moss Softwash has done on my roof, I needed moss removed as well as a good cleaning. No Moss also cleaned out my gutters. I recommend this local company for this type of roof work. Moss and algae can cause damage to your roof over time and this is the company to take care of it.</Review>

<Text>No Moss did an excellent job of cleaning mildew, moss, and algae from my roof, sides of house, porch, walkways, and driveway.  The people were friendly and honest in all their dealings with me.   They were hard and steady workers.  They were thorough, efficient, careful, and efficient.  I am extremely pleased with their work and the result - it all turned out even better than I expected.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Chris from No Moss came out to give me an estimate on removing and treating the moss growing on my roof.  After looking at multiple areas on my roof and observing it's condition, Chris told me I may be better off replacing it.  Rather than make a sale, he then gave me some guidelines to ensure I hire a reputable roofing coming.  Who does that?  I was really pleasantly surprised at his desire, first, to be of service.  Thank you Chris!  This is the kind of company I'm glad to recommend to others.</text>

<Text>No Moss Softwash did a great job for me.  I literally had moss on my roof, my brick fire pit, my brick walkways, and cement where the water runs from the down spout.  They took care of all that for me through a softwash process, not pressure wash.  Chris was very thorough with explaining the process and what they could do.  The estimate was written to provide a breakdown of items so that I could pick and choose services. The two young men who came to do the work, were very thorough as well.  They were very careful with my property including plants, which were no worse for the wear after the process.  They cleaned windows off from any overspray.  They also did an excellent job at clean-up after cleaning both roofs.  When they left, everything was put back where it came from and the place looked sparkly.  I would definitely use their services again.< /Text>< Pictures>

No Moss was here on Friday, Dec. 4, to clean and sanitize my roof. They use a 'soft wash' process rather than pressure washing. Chris (the owner) and his employee, Jordan, did a fantastic job.  They were here 6 hours and left my driveway, walkway and yard spotless (no moss residue left behind).  And washed all windows, too. No Moss may charge more than other companies for roof cleaning, but they are very detailed and earned every bit of the fee. They were very professional and polite. Chris explained the process and answered all my questions.  The bonus is a 5 year warranty.<//review>

Jonathan and his partner did a good job my sidings are 13 years old but they look brand new after, same with my solar panel. I thank God for leading me to the right company. I called one but never showed up. Then Brandon returned my call.. I thank God everytime I have work done in my house I pray and ask God to send me the right people. God always answered my prayers.

<Text>Based on their excellent reviews, I contacted No Moss for roof and solar panel cleaning.  Brandon was out to do an estimate the next day.  I had a question about the equipment used on the solar panels, and Chris answered it promptly.  I accepted the bid and was scheduled for the following day, today.  Chris and Jonathan arrived on schedule, got right to work, and did a spectacular job of removing at least 20 years of moss and lichen buildup.  The roof looks new (it's 30 years old) and will only look better as the spray takes full effect.  The solar panels look better than when they were installed, and I'm sure it will make a significant difference in power generation.  I appreciated the care they took to safeguard and protect plants and trees, as well as their diligence in cleaning up.  As I told Chris, I will be recommending No Moss to all of my neighbors and friends.  Their attention to detail is off the charts!<//Text>< Date>

I'm very pleased with my experience with No Moss! From the initial estimate and on-site discussion with Brandon, and the completed process and treatment of my roof with Chris. [and another worker].  They were both quite knowledgeable, professional, and willing to answers my questions, throughout the entire interaction. I choice their company [No Moss], because of its 'soft-wash' approach to cleaning and treating my tile roof. I would recommend this company, and would use its services again.</text>

Chris Lombardo and his crew cleaned the moss off our large two story house and the roof over the detached garage/apartment.  They were thorough and even found a place where gutter guards we had installed were not installed.  We never would have known.  Chris explained the entire process and took incredible care with coverage and plant protection and left our roof/house spotless.  The moss on east side was significant because we live in a neighborhood with lots of big trees.  We know the damage moss can do to a roof and had we not hired Chris - No Moss- eventually would have needed roof replacement. They removed a significant amount and the remainder is dying.  We recommend Chris his crew, who were wonderful, and No Moss without reservation. Call them. You’ll be glad you did!

These guys were wonderful! Cory and Jonathon who came out to clean up our house were so polite, on time, worked really really hard! I'm so impressed with the work they did on our entire house. I can't wait to see it evolve over time.

Chris who came out to take a look at our house and do an estimate was also wonderful. He didn't pressure us into anything and just gave the the info and that was that. Quote came quickly and we knew exactly what we were getting before work had even begun. I wouldn't hesitate to hire Chris and his team of hard workers!  Thank you!</text>

This is one of the best experiences I had in years! Chris and his staff treated my roof for moss in August 2017 and, after a long day of hard work,  the roof looked like new. Yet they came back in May 2018, re-checked it and then cleaned some of the spots they considered "less than perfect". The return visit was included in the original price. They are quietly efficient, quick, professional and very friendly. The price was very-very fair.
If I could give them ten stars ... I would! Wonderful job! I highly-highly recommend them. Thank you Chris and crew!< /Text>

<text>No Moss staff did an amazing job cleaning our stone patio. I actually believe some of those stones were cleaner than when they were originally installed! The two men were very thorough, very polite, and explained the soft wash treatment they were applying. We will definitely hire them again for our annual maintenance.<//text>< Pics>

No Moss did excellent work cleaning the gutters and downspouts  on our 6 building complex in Rocklin and on our block of duplexes in Carmichael.  Chris and his crew did a thorough job of cleaning the gutters and downspouts and they cleaned up beautifully.  No Moss leaves No Mess !
2018 is the second year I've used this company and I can't conceive of using anyone else in the future.  Their work is always professional, their price is very competitive, and Chris is a joy to work with.

You won't be disappointed if you use the services of this company.  No Moss does great work !</Review>

Chris and his crew of very nice young men just left.  They power washed the outside of my entire house, including two chimneys.  They also power washed the driveway, all sidewalks, patio, two large roll down shade screens on the patio, and my two outdoor rocking chairs.  I couldn't ask for a better job.  Everything is perfectly beautiful and clean.  They were even very careful not to step on any of my plants next to the house.  All mud wasp stains gone, rust stains gone, moss gone, and the house and gutters look freshly painted.  I highly recommend this company!<//review>

<text>No Moss is a first rate company. The crew arrived on time, they were well organized and got right to work. They spent the whole day cleaning the roof of leaves and debris, cleaning the gutters, scraping the large chunks of moss, then treating the entire roof. The crew was very efficient and made sure they cleaned up the entire outside of the house prior to completing the job. Very happy with their work and have recommended them to 3 neighbors already. Thanks Chris Lombardo and No Moss!<//text>< username>

California No Moss is a highly professional company.  They did an excellent job removing moss from our tile roof and cleaning our gutters.  They were very careful of our outdoor plants and furniture and made sure that no residue was left on the outside walls or windows.  Chris, his son and the rest of the crew were friendly and very willing to answer any questions that we had which was very important for my wife.
California No Moss is Wife approved!<//Review>

I looked around for experts in this field..."soft washing"
I didn't just want a pressure washer...I wanted a soft wash company that knew what they were doing. I didn't want them destroying the roof or stuco on my home...
After talking with Chris, I was sold that this was THE company for the job. His price was slightly higher than the other companies, but his knowledge, reputation, and reviews, spoke volumes to me.
If you want Moss removal or property washing...look no further.
No Moss is the BEST!!!
Thank you Chris for an awesome product and reputation!< /Text>

They first scraped off the existing moss and it fell off in chunks. Then they climbed on top of the roof and sprayed their "moss sauce" on the roof. As Chris explained, the solution over time will decompose and eliminate the moss in all the nooks and crannies on the roof. One thing he mentioned as well, was that with the first rains of the season, don't be surprised if you see the roof turn a white color and bubble up as the "moss sauce" gets reactivated with the rain water and will continue to do it's magic. My only negative comment is that there was noticeable chunks of moss around the house that I've been having to pick up and it got all on my patio cushions which will have to be cleaned somehow. It is an expensive process but worth it. We had the worse roof in the neighborhood and now it looks so much better. Chris and his son were very nice and worked hard.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>I do not usually write reviews, but my experience with California Moss Control  warrants an exception.

I needed someone to clean the gutters on my two-story home so I entered my contact info into the Home Advisor search engine.  Chris (who I later learned was the owner of Cal.  Moss Control) called me within minutes to schedule an appt for an estimate.

I really didn't understand why a "gutter cleaning" company was called "moss control," but when Chris gave me the estimate he also schooled me on the corrosive effects of the green moss that was growing in my relatively new roof.  It was a form of black mold that feeds on the lye in the composite shingles and that spills off the roof and covers the sidewalk and driveway.  I always thought the green slime we dealt with during the winter was attributed to the northward orientation of our house--not so.  It was digesting my roof and the lye in my aggregate driveway.

So I agreed to hire Chris to clean my gutters, treat my roof and to power wash my sidewalks and driveway.

I cannot overstate how professional and expert he and his crew were.  They treated my property as though it was their own.  And they are environmentally friendly:  Instead of washing everything down the street gutter they opened my sewer and channeled all the effluent into the city sewers.

Yes, I paid for more than a simple gutter cleaning, but every time I walk out front or drive into my driveway I think of how thankful I am for the education Chris gave me.  He saved my expensive roof and ridded me of the green moss I had resigned to live with.  I will definitely use California Moss Control again and will recommend the company highly to all my family and friends!  Thank you Chris!!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

I love this nursery! The plant selection is huge, and the quality it excellent. I haven't had anything I've gotten from them die after transplanting. The staff is friendly helpful and knowledgeable. I definitely recommend this nursery 💚</Text>

<Review>Such a wonderful place to buy plants and plant related products! I have been going there since I was a small child. Great atmosphere. Time to celebrate 75 years! They have a wide variety of plants from cacti to strawberries. Great employees and costumers, with a nice outdoors area to walk around and look at plants, reasonable pricing, but the only reason I give them 4 stars not 5 is because of some of the higher prices. A wonderful place for plants!</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Beautiful nursery with a variety of different plants and trees, big and small. Came here to purchase a really hard to find plant. They had posted it on IG. I called to make sure they still had it and they were nice enough to put it on hold for me. The employees were super nice and helpful. They have street parking which kinda makes it hard to park but we were lucky to get a spot across the street.<//Review>< user_id>

<Text>Great place for plants at great prices! The only reason it's not a 5 is the inconsistent interactions or lack of with the staff. I usually don't ask staff questions for help so I don't mind it. Staff rarely ever ask if you need anything. I don't get that "one plant lover to another" vibe; it's mostly a cold transaction or curt response. But if all you care about is getting some nice plants and leaving, this place does the job!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808f86b87923651f:0xc4e522b2a8e92d20<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Excellent variety of happy healthy houseplants and pottery. All prices and sizes of both to fit small to large needs. Somebody with a good eye understands what to order and stock the store with. PLUS! They will drill holes in planters that don't have them, which is a very helpful and smart service to offer.</text><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I love visiting Bay Area nursery’s, but this is probably the worse experience I’ve had. Asked multiple people for assistant they all brushed me off, but were will to help everyone else. I’m NOT going to spend my money where it isn’t wanted. On my way to Home Depot for the same but affordable plants.< /review>

Huge selection of both indoor and outdoor plants. All very well cared for and healthy. Good prices too. They have both common and rare plants and have new things every time I go. Definitely a favorite in the East Bay</review>

Beloved Alameda institution that has been in business for quite a long time. Relaxed, mellow and invigorating vibe always.

This place was pretty busy, and the older man that we had asked for help was of very little help. He clearly seemed to think he had better things to do than to help us find houseplants that might do well in dimly lit rooms, or to give us some tips on how to help plants live in rooms that are nearly sunless. He seemed bothered by the question and simply recommended we not have plants.

Screw this guy. His attitude amounts to an elitist exclusion of many renters from the privilege of owning some frickin houseplants. I mean, excuse me if there aren't enough huge, sunny remodeled victorians covered in windows to go around for everyone. I get that this place is in Alameda, and Alameda has that entitled "homeowner" vibe, but I presumed nonetheless that a business would be accustomed to questions like mine given that around half of the residents in this part of the east bay are renters. Many of us live in odd conversions or struggle to get some green in given our limited square footage. This is a pretty common set of questions: search the internet for help and you'll find tons of pages that address questions on houseplants in odd spaces. I made my visit here over six months ago and am writing this review because I still find his attitude offensive.

If you have questions about indoor houseplants don't even bother with this place, and if you do, avoid the less cheerful of the two older white men. After some inspiring reading on the internet, I learned that getting some cheap growlights to compensate for low light conditions is one way to go, and my bathroom rainforest is taking shape, no thanks to the curmudgeons at Encinal Nursury.</Text>

Great place for plants - Customer service is hit or miss. Sometimes you deal with someone wonderful who shares their enthusiasm, and sometimes get a terrible know-it-alls.</review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><name>Amanda Smith</name>< Review>
One of their employees was drunk. (He reeked of alcohol) and proceeded to harass me and try to distract my service dog even after he was asked not to. Because of my specific disability, distracting my service dog can be very dangerous to me (I can end up on the floor injured if she is distracted at the wrong moment.)  Though they have a decent selection, this man was so disrespectful towards me when I asked him to stop that I will probably never go back. I should note something similar happened the last time I was here as well (though the employee did not reek last time-- I'm pretty sure it was the same guy.) Shame because they are convenient for me and have a decent selection. The woman ringing me up was very helpful and seemed a bit mortified by this guy's behavior.< /Review>

Daily sub: 3.99$. Make is a salad: 7.01$

75% increase in price to... remove the bread? Huh? Management says, "That is the price. If you do not want this you do not have to have it." OK. Fair enough. (Unfortunately I specifically asked the rep at the front if the salad was the same price.) Deli D, Just the Tip, Libelula is right down the street.<//review>

This has got to be the worst SUBWAY restaurant that I have ever been to in Fresno. The staff seems to not understand English too well and they are rude. Bread tasted stale and the restaurant floor and booths were dirty.<//text>

Great jam twice a month, awesome people! Some pretty famous blues folks show up for this jam. I was impressed with the owners band, too! No drama allowed.<//text>

We are hoping to go into he Yellow Tier around April 14th at which time we can serve indoors. We have a pool table and the shuffle board is always free. When we can we will bring back Karaoke and the Jam Sessions.  Thank you for the 5 star and I promise you won't be disappointed when we open indoors.\n\nThanks Michael and Cori"}< /Resp>< date>

First time here and it looks like a great place to hang out and have a drink after work.  Outside seating only for now. Kitchen isn’t open yet but the picks look great and they are planning to open inside seating in seven days.  I’ll be back then.  Beers on me!< /text>

I have to be fair with this constructed criticism about the the mecca club, I made a lot good friends at the mecca and never had a problem with any bartenders, Now the part owner through marriage Mike Pixley who 86eds all the good people and 3 superstar bartenders 1 just recently am giving the Mecca a 1 star my suggestion to all happy customers watch out for Mike he a madman don't trust him he will turn on you that why I don't care to go there any more after the way Mike and Cory treated their customers something for you to think about I feel people should step up and give their input...</Text>

<Review>Perfect Dive bar. Every time I been here there has been no drama. Local water hole in west sac.  Cash only atm on site. Not your average water hole. Best bar tender in the area.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Interesting hole in the wall. The bar has been updated from the pics I saw on Google and they added a shuffle board table. My only complaint is the music from the juke box is really low and when patrons are paying for it. ..just doesnt sit well.</Review><user_id>114585190065635885065<//user_id>< Name>

Are you to say, this is where I want to be??? Because it may be, depending on how you need your drinks prepared. If only a Cold One, so OK, but mixed beverages tend to be a longer waiting time, so OK it depends!<//text>

They have a stage for live music and that's always a plus. Pool table, shuffleboard, and a popcorn machine...what more can you ask from a dive bar? The patrons/atmoshphere are always hit or miss for a small place, sometimes a bit questionable but I usually have a fun time here.<//review>

<review>This place is cash only. For a dive its chill. It has music and pool. They even have a shuffle board. They have an atm machine. So that's a plus. I wouldn't go clubbing here but its chill to just have a few drinks and hang out< /review>< pictures>

As I've said for years now, ever since "Tex" Goin (Go-In) owned the joint, "This is a 'Family Bar'. You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your relatives. Walk in here and you're stuck with us." Honestly, it has that "Down Home" feeling that makes you feel comfortable, regardless of whether you're playing darts, shuffleboard, pool or just having a few "Libations" at your local "Libationary".< /Review>

I'm torn sweet people excellent customer service only ordered nacatamales and was sooooo disappointed. I hate tamales but love nacatamales. The nacatamales were just huge tamales I was so disappointed. Flavor was good but not enough meat since that was literally the only thing in it. I expected to tomato potatoes maybe rice I mean a traditional nacatamale. I don't "look" Nicaraguan because I'm dark and I don't always want to speak Spanish so they kinda assumed I was some tourist or something I never appreciate that assumption but it's typical and they were still kind to me although I kept asking them for a 2nd piece of 3leches cake but they thought I was crazy. I have 4 children plus at home I live with 4 other people I made a large order bc that's 9 people they were trying to protect me from buying so much stuff but I knew what I was ordering 🤦🏽‍♀️🙄 thanks but no thanks yet in the end we were disappointed so 🤷🏽‍♀️ 3leche was perfect though. Good cakes! 🤤😍🤗</Review>

Not fancy, but great (only) place to try Nicaraguan nacatamales. The woman running the show the day I stopped by was extremely friendly and happy to describe the food. Recommended try if you're in the area....</review>

Yesterday I stopped by the store to switch over from a different company and the sales associate Lin attended me. He was very polite and he didn’t try to rush through the process even though they were other people waiting to be attended. He didn’t try to trick me into getting something I didn’t want although he did offer politely other accessories for my phone, I just didn’t need them but all together I walked out of this store feeling happy about the service. Will definitely be coming back to the la brea AT&T.<//text>

Chris was the best customer service rep, he recommended all the right accessories I needed and helped me get my information transferred to my new phone. He made it simple, quick and informative. Hands down Chris is the best rep at this store look for him if you ever need anything from the AT&T store in West Hollywood!<//Review>

<text>The manager Isabelle was EXTREMELY helpful. After a verrry long week trying to transfer from another phone service, multiple calls and a previous trip to AT&T, it was nice to finally have someone who cared and helped figure out all of my problems. On top of that, she was short staffed and still the most helpful employee I’ve dealt with this passed week.<//text>< Pictures>

Don’t even know where to Begin. My experience wasn’t great. First off I didn’t feel safe doing business in the store with workers not having mask on properly. Also I found out after my upgrade that additional features were added to my account without authorization. Insurance and a feature called next up. Which I did not have before I walked into this store. Very very shady. Could go unnoticed easily I’m sure this is happening to many customers without them realizing it. I will not be returning to this location because of this and thinking about switching my service elsewhere!< /Review>

Christopher was a tremendous help to me and gave me a fantastic AT&T experience. I will definitely be a returning customer and I am beyond thrilled with the customer service that I have been gifted. Christopher is a tremendous employee and definitely deserves a raise, if he doesn’t get one I’ll be disappointed in AT&T. Thank you so much for hiring this guy he really hooked me up and help me out with my new phone and data plan. His knowledge and experience made my shopping experience very easy from start to finish. He had answers for all Questions and he was there to assist me through each step of the process even on text. This man should be employee of the month< /review>

Incredibly shady Manager. I’m contacting the BBB about my experience! I’m not receiving credit for my trade in device because according to ATT it was cancelled by Stephanie! No one knows where my phone is!!! I was told it takes about 3 months to receive credit and guess what ? Nothing !!!This is robbery! I’ve tried to call the store and I’ve never gotten a call back I’ve requested to speak with the district manager and apparently he or she refuses to speak with the general public. My bill is incredibly high and I just feel like crying I’m so upset and no one wants to help! This is not the proper way to conduct business! Why would you steal my phone !!!!!!!</Review>

I stopped by today to pick up the new IPhone 12 Pro Max. Before purchasing, I had a few questions in regard to my bill and the process for upgrading/fully purchasing a new phone and Brandon was EXCEPTIONAL!!! He was patient with me and my hundreds of questions and had a great positive attitude during my whole purchase. If you stop by this location, make sure you ask for him! Thanks again, Brandon!<//Review>

<text>My experience with this store and representative David was disappointing.
Very helpful at the beginning when I was inquiring about service, but after the sale happened no answer or resolution.
This individual give me his number to reach out to him or if I had any question or help.

<text>Chris was a great help in my transition from sprint to at&t. Even though I stopped by on Monday 10/19 to browse for a new plan, he didn’t pressure me to get a new plan that same day, took his time to answer my questions, and was a huge help. Chris is a great person that helped in my transition and he’s very people friendly! I highly encourage anyone that wants to transfer to at&t to come and Chris will take care of you the way he did for myself and my wife! I highly encourage you to come.</text>< resp>

David changed my phone plan without my permission.  I see today he made my bill more expensive. Without my permission!!!! I asked him two times what he was doing and he would not give me a straightforward answer! Very disappointed and will be calling headquarters about this!< /Review>

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! I'm a healthcare worker and when I signed up they told me to bring my work tag and they would add the discount, a couple of days later I went back with my tag. I'm not sure if this guy was the owner of this AUTHORIZED (because it's not an official store)  location, but he was helping a customer with buying a phone, HE TOLD ME COME BACK ANOTHER DAY! And I replied but I'm here right now and he said yes but I am busy keep in mind I am Mexican and I was wearing sweats that day. So in his mind I look nothing like that Anglo American that he was helping with selling a phone. Do not waste your time there just go to the one off of La Brea and Santa Monica literally a three minute drive</Text>

< Review>
I can honestly I say I don’t really write reviews at all unless I’m blown away. If it is a negative experience, I simply don’t return, instead of being some viral vigilante with a review. This is one of those cases where the service I was rendered exceeded my expectations. I’ve come to this location before and have always been treated exceptionally. This time around, I went by to simply inquire what it would take to upgrade my internet capabilities. Not only did an associate named Lin answer all my questions, he immediately set me on a path towards a solution that was not only easier than I could have hoped for, it was actually COST EFFECTIVE. When does that happen?!?! Lin made me feel that this interaction was between actual human beings, rather than a means towards a quota or a sale. He was personable, kind and incredibly informative about the avenues I had available to me that I was clueless towards. It’s these kind relations that make me loyal to the brand, ongoing for over a decade. Thank you so much Lin, the company is so lucky to have you and you will for sure me again as long as you’re there!</Review>

Christian (I think that was his name) and the store manager (a woman with shoulder length blonde curly hair who’s name I didn’t catch) were very helpful. They went above and beyond to find a solution for me, making multiple phone calls and checking things on the computer. They totally could’ve just said “no we can’t do that” but they put in an earnest effort to help me out and accommodate my situation. I left with my issue (something that was my fault, not theirs) 100% resolved and a new, working phone in hand. Great customer service! Additionally, the store felt COVID safe— there was sanitizer at the door, lots of space, and clear dividers at the tables. It was really well air conditioned, clean, had a parking lot, and had security. I was greeted and put on a waitlist as soon as I arrived, and was being helped within 5 minutes. Overall, a positive experience and a store I will return to if I need anything else.<//Text>

When I arrived I pointed out exactly the kind of phone I wanted... I also clearly said that I had an prepaid account already for 5 years but someone had stole my iPhone-11 just day ago. So I needed something convenient and cheap just for the meantime so I had what it was I wanted. Anyway they sold me on an idea of an generation iPhone because they said it was faster so I never even looked at it because they said the software was a year old but better.so I paid over $220 for the iPhone and after I left I started to use it I realized that the format was like an older generation with the button in the middle and it was confusing so I took it back and they charged me $55 for restocking fee... I was upset I had to pay that considering I didn't ask for that iPhone they told me it was better</text>

<Text>Called from another AT&T store to see if they had the pre paid phone I wanted in stock. Spoke to a salesman named Lin. He said they did and including a month of service (which I explained I didn’t need but still had to purchase in order to get the deal on the phone) was $165 “out the door” & I agreed to go in. He took my credit card and all seemed well. I asked again, $165 out the door?- including one month service? “Yes!” Lin said. Ok... When done I asked for a receipt. He said one would be emailed to me. So I left.
No receipt... Hmm... better check my card. Was charged $56 AND $165. Ok. Call and left message for Lin. No call back. Drove all the back to the store. He’s not there I’m told by Anthony who seems upset and gets louder and talks faster with each question I ask. There is a display in the store saying pre paid plans from $30 to $50 so I said ok- I know I had to pay a month even if Lin lied about the total but why the most expensive plan? Anthony says Oh no, they start at $50.
But your display says 30.
Oh not any more I’m told. Whatever. So I go home- look on AT&T web site. Plans start at $30.
Watch out for these guys. Commissioned liars.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

The ATT store was an amazing experience. Specifically, Jojo & Ketta were tremendously helpful and really took their time to figure out the right plans for me. I can’t say how grateful I am to receive this type of help and compassion during this time. Will always come here!</text>

<Review>I called today on iPhone 12 launch day and was happy to find out that they had a 128gb model in stock, which was not my first choice but it was in stock so I went in just before closing and was helped by Lin who checked in the back and found a 256gb model which was my first choice so that worked out great.

He was very helpful and within minutes I was able to trade in my old iPhone and get the new 12 which he helped check and confirm it had a signal when I powered it up in the store.

He also helped a great deal with a case recommendation that was very much appreciated!  However, I did notice after leaving that my account now had an added insurance plan which I didn’t ask for and didn’t have before but I am guessing it was a computer error and I was easily able to cancel it in the AT&T app once I got home. If it wasn’t an error I would have to subtract a few stars.</Review>< pics>

I had a fantastic experience at AT&T thanks to the kindness of the Manager, Steph, and a team member whose name I believe is Ronit. To cut to the chase, I had to transfer my personal number from a corporate account due to company wide layoff due to the pandemic (I work in the hotel business). Anyhow, it was complicated and they both made it easy and recognized that I was in a bad spot and worked to find me a great deal for a really nice phone. Also, while waiting for my phone to be setup I witnessed a team member working with an elderly lady who did not speak English very well, and he did not speak her language however really worked to assist her.  Not only did he help her, but he assisted by calling her a cab from his phone to a nearby store as they did not carry the phone she was previously familiar with and wanted to set her up for success. I was really really impressed to say the least by everyone I interacted with today.<//Text>

<Review>This five star review goes to the manager. She was the only saving grace for this store. The person who greeted us was rude and clearly wanted to get back to talking to the other employees. They couldn't really answer basic questions without help. The male manager didn't really seem too happy to help us either, he just wanted to stay behind the counter and type on the computer. But the female manager was AMAZING. She was helping several issues at once and kept smiling through it all. Maybe all the AT&T stores would stay open if they hired more people like her. Thank you for keeping us as customers.</Review>< resp>

In 08-06-2020 me and my friend went to This location So we needed to trade in to phones one was Samsung galaxy note 9 ($1300 price) the other iPhone 7 ($800 or 900 price)  so at first we got help by a guy name Larry then later his manager helped us her name is Stephanie so they told us about a deal which we were spouse to pay $240 every month for tv WiFi and two iPhone 11 and phone service we agreed then we signed up that day it’s pass two weeks we got charged $400 from att then I went to ask her why we got this changed she said oh two phones which you guys gave us the credit will hit with two or three billing periods I was surprised but I said ok coz I had no choice then it’s pass 4 billing period no credit on phones we are paying a lot of money every month we end up canceling tv WiFi coz we couldn’t pay it anymore bill was a lot then we call the att trade in department they said we don’t have any phones under your name then we talked  to almost 100 att agents on the phone they can’t find any phone under my name and they don’t do anything about it I went to the store many times store manager Stephanie doesn’t talk to me anymore she hides or got her one time she told me i don’t want talk to you anymore leave you are everyday here I said I’m here because I’m paying the money which I was not agreed about then I talk to other managers in that store they didn’t do anything sit pass almost 8 months and att didn’t do anything the store didn’t do anything about it my two phones got lost and I’m paying a lot of money to att. I actually have my both phones boxes and serial numbers I gave this serial numbers to many att agents and as well to the stores employees they didn’t do anything about it. So my last option was to report two phones lost and report it to the police. Because I paid during this period more then I agreed. Here is the thing I’m not gonna give up I’ll fight till the end because my phones are expensive and  plus I paid too much money for no reason if att doesn’t do anything about it I’m going to report this to business bureau.< /Review>

Wonderful, fast and friendly service! I ordered a new iPhone online today for pick up and received a confirmation immediately for pick up. 2 hours later I got an email it was ready AND the store called to say it was ready too.
When I pulled up it was a small and easy parking lot to navigate and plenty of signage outside prompting you to call. The nice worker came right outside to confirm my order and identity safely and with a mask on (not the scary kind). He then ran back in and grabbed it to bring out. Nice guy and great service!< /text>

<Review>The BEST AT&T store experience I’ve ever had. Manny is amazing!!!  Manny did everything possible to make sure I got the best service available at my price point. He was friendly, polite, professional, helpful and soooo patient with all my questions! Stephanie also helped out and was so kind. I couldn’t have asked for better customer service.  It’s also worth mentioning that I witnessed these employees deal with a irrationally angry and confused elderly man (clearly suffering from some form of mental illness or dementia) with an exceptional level of patience, tolerance and levelheadedness. The kind of stuff that renews your faith in humanity.< /Review>< rate>

Brandon and Lin helped to make my terrible nightmare of a day into a great day.  Lin helped me find out my options because my pre-ordered iPhone 12 pro Max was stolen in transit.  The customer service pho line kept giving me the run around and could not give me definitive answers  as to what I could do.  I went in to the store and Lin coordinated with Brandon to explore my options and fix everything so that my terrible day turned amazing.  They were very helpful, informative, and kind to help me figure out what to do next.  It’s employees like them that build customer loyalty because I will be returning in store if I ever have issues or questions.  Also, because if they’re customer service, I’m more likely to purchase more accessories and new phones in the near future from them.< /Review>

Marwin was very helpful with the purchase of my beautiful new iPhone 11 Pro!! Plus case and pop socket. Larry was also very helpful before hand over the phone. Go see them and have your phone dreams come true. They also applied all of the current deals which was amazing!</text>

I cannot speak highly enough of my experience at this store.  Most specifically, DAVE was so helpful and patient as we worked out the very best options for my purchase and plan.  He took the time to ask so many questions and really went the extra mile to be sure I had the right plan for my family.  We learned as we talked that we were actually from the same neighborhood in NYC.  We enjoyed connecting over that shared experience... but it also didn’t slow Dave down.

When he passed it off to his manager, Stephanie, she was also a delight to deal with.   Fare exceeding any experiences I’ve had with AT&T in store or by phone, this particular store and these folks made me feel like a valued customer.<//Review>

I arrived at an ATT STORE urgently due to lack of service. Ironically I’m getting ready to work again for the first time since March 2020 due to pandemic and my phone decided to stop working. I really heavily on my phone and receive multiple emails and phone call prior to my work days and any missed call can cost me my job.  After Three hours of no service and Attempting to contact att on line with no results, I decided to go to att @ la brea and Santa Monica Blvd. When I arrived Sergio U, a store rep, immediately greeted me and asked what brought me in. I told him I had a serious emergency and explained the situation. He the proceeded to proceeds my request in a timely manner and started targeting possible issues. Within minutes my phone was back in service. I appreciate great customer service and empathy for the customer. Sergio did just that. Thank you!< /Review>

<review>Out of all the phone companies I have been too, and looking for the best deals.  I’ve yet to find exactly what I want but the best and most kind person I’ve encountered in any store was RONIT.  Rarely do I express my experience publicly unless it’s above and beyond. She went 5 extra miles to try and help me resolve my shopping needs, concerns about moving to a new carrier, and made sure if and when, it will always be met with a smile and professionalism.  I recommend coming directly to her if you decide to go with ATT.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

When I first went to the store to complete my upgrade, I was told that I qualify for Firstnet and was advised to get my service switched over. I went with firstnet bc of the discounts offered (free watch and iPad service). A week after receiving my new phone and watch I started to get text from firstnet saying I did not meet criteria. I called the store and they said I was signed up as a nurse and they would fix it. A couple of days went by and I received a second notification saying I did not meet qualification. I contact the store again and they said “ ohh you were setup as a police officer. I’ll (Stephanie) fix it and you should be good. Don’t worry about it.” Stephanie gave me her personal number and asked for me to send my work ID and contract for my job so she could upload it. My contract ended and I came back to Texas where I’m from. I received a third text saying I do not meet qualifications. I texted Stephanie and she did not respond back. I called the store multiple times no answer. Last week I finally spoke to someone and they said they will let Stephanie know the issue and she will contact me back. I have not received no callbacks. Mind you, I’m in TX and this store is in CA-I can’t physically go there. I contact the store yesterday and the guy said “ we don’t have mangers at this store anymore and hung up in my face “. I called back, no answer. I reached out to firstnet for assistance. They told me that the store screwed up on my bill and did not have the right to set me up with firstnet bc my job description(medical social worker)  is not a option. She said I was given false information. The lady from firstnet tried to contact the store 3X’s with me on the phone and no answer. We even tried Stephanie phone number. No answer. So now I am paying for a watch and service that was suppose to be free. I’m coming out of pocket with more money because of the store employees screw up. It’s lore disappointing that they’re not trying to assist me and ignoring me. I went to a local AT&T store in Tx and they said the store in CA did not mail off my trade it and it’s been a month in a half. So my bill is not going to receive discounts until it’s mailed off. We have tried to contact the store again and no answer.  Before this store my bill was not even half of what I’m paying now. I was told by firstnet and AT&T customer service to report this store bc I was basically given fraudulent information and my service was screwed up. I advise others to go to another store.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1608760289792, 'text': 'Hello Raven Robinson This is not the experience we wanted you to have.

Horrible customer service.  Processed upgrades for my phones but not the trade in.  When I went back told, me to call customer service as they could not help.  It had been only three weeks and they "couldn't find" the orders.  How could I have gotten my phone.  Worthless staff.  Worthless.<//Review>

Flores, asked us what we needed. He invited us to wait on our cars and to notify us when it was safe to enter the store so that we didn’t have to stand in line in the sun.

Once in the store, the guard told us to see the sales agent, Ronit. As we approached the table, she had just sanitized the table. She helped us with the purchase of an iPhone 11 Pro and case. Ronit was knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. I also had a question about my mom’s number. My mom recently passed away. Ronit gave me her condolences, which I appreciated.<//Text>< rate>

Without going into great detail, he assisted in ableling me yo get Netflix without wifi wiring and using a hotspot. He also helped me with email information because I am not tech savvy. On a 1 to 10 he's about a 10 1/2 . The brightest smartest  person I have ever been able to meet. He should be doing seminars for att on how to use att products for people that don't understand online tech. He is the most remarkable person I have met.

I never updated this -- the team must have seen me as an easy mark. When I got home I saw they had charged me for a more expensive phone than I asked for, and I needed a second line for my business and I told them I need the basic service on one of my lines, but they set ne up for the most expensive on both and claimed it was a one time charge. I had been grandfathered into paying 70$ a month for the last 4 years but after my experience there I've been charged upwards of 200$ and can no longer get the rate that I had before. It's honestly been the biggest headache and Im sure they knew I didn't understand all of the technicals and they kept add in to my package. Before I swiped my card they insisted I leave a review and that's on me. This is my first had review but to do that to someone who was transparent about their needs wasn't right.
---------

Chris Lira was an exceptional customer service agent. He was patient, didn't rush us as we sought information on adding a phone line. He was able to get me the most out of the available promotions and show me the best phone for my business. I will absolutely continue to seek service from this store location. Thanks for everything Chris!< /review>

Amazing team Led by Stephanie the store manager. I went in to return an atttv, the gentlemen at the store were incredibly helpful and showed me how to use my atttv.  Aside from the fact that they are all incredibly handsome ,they are incredibly patient and understanding. I felt like a true VIP. Will send all of my single friends to this store .</Text>

<Text>Came in to change my phone since it was old and not working anymore. Noel helped me out and gave my the best option that help me choose a phone and also told me about the great deals on internet and tv , but unfortunately in my area the speeds are not suitable for my use, suck because the price with a tv bundle was amazing , that cost me not to get the tv , but overall Noel was the best ! If you have any questions or concerns go to Noel for the best customer service.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Terrible customer service. I returned a phone there and was told it would be taken off my bill. When I received my bill it was still on there, and went in to check out what was going on. The gentleman helping me was very dismissive and acted as if I was a bother to him. He questioned me like I was lying, even though he was the one that returned my phone initially. He confirmed the phone was off my bill.  I just received my next bill and it’s still on there, two months later! When I called customer service they said they have no record of the returned phone. Now I have no phone yet I am still being charged for it.< /review>

My iPhone 11 Pro’s sleep button was not working and Noah and Walter made it so easy for me to exchange it for a brand new one, 10 mins in and out, they were super friendly and made us feel welcomed at their store. Thank you so much!!!<//Review>

<Name>Julio Hernández< /Name><time>1598144193000< /time><Rate>1</Rate><text>This review is not about this store in particular but about AT&T in general.
I enrolled in wireless and internet here. The representative was clear regardless what I was gonna be billed monthly for both services. I received a bill for $53 more than what I expected. An activation fee was charged. I called customer service to get clarification regarding the additional $23 and they only said they charged prorated but they weren't able to tell me how much and what would be me next bill since they have charged some unspecified amount in advance. I'm going back to T-mobile after less than 2 months of service because of this.
Regarding the internet, I had to have 2 technicians come over to set it up, got the impression they didn't know what they were doing. I would advice anybody to stay away from this company.< /text>< Pics>

George was absolutely fantastic. Most definitely the easiest upgrade process I've done in my entire life. (especially during COVID-19) This was the slickest of slicks transactions. Lightning fast.

Mentioned I was upgrading for my birthday next week and they provided a little goodie bag for me. Damn talk about royal treatment. Thank you AT&T customer for life. #AT&TCustomerForLife<//Text>

I wish I would have gotten the names of the two that helped me, yesterday 7/18/20. I walked in with many issues that I have battled with on the phone several times with no resolve. I believe the blond female was a manager(?) and the Latinxo gent were SO helpful and got me out of there quickly. Long story, but thank you. I am sorry I did not get their names but I appreciate the help. I felt very safe as well as for COVID protocols.</text>

AT&T Associate Daven provided excellent service. During my appointment at the retail store to request activation of a replacement phone I received from insurer Asurion, Daven was able not only to activate the replacement phone  but also to import all the data from the phone that it replaced, up to the date of my last backup onto the cloud, into the replacement phone. He also wrote down the exact steps that I should follow later at home in order to import any backup data on my IPad from the cloud into the replacement phone. As he worked, Daven explained all the steps he followed in both the phone activation and data transfer. I was very satisfied with this experience and expressed my appreciation for the professionalism that Daven displayed with his helpful assistance throughout the entire process.Thank you!< /Text>

<Review>promises made in the store did not reflect on billing. When questioned the store stated they can't help me much if I don't remember the name of the individual that made the promises. I ended up calling customer service right outside the store and the issue was resolved in a few minutes.<//Review><pics>None</pics></record>

Just as other reviewer‘s said, this is a terrible store. Just waited 15 minutes and was not helped. Was told I need to wait longer if I wanted someone to take care of me. I’m trying to spend money and buy a new phone. Simply mind blowing that I can’t get someone to even help me out!!!
Find another location, or call someone. You won’t get helped here if you don’t have hours to wait around.< /Text>

In the past the AT&T store on the East edge of West Hollywood would have received 5 Stars hands down but, it has in the past 2 years taken a turn for the worst. YES when my phone got destroyed in an accident they replaced in with a far more durable model but, now getting to talk with the staff and paying your bill on site is difficult. REALLY, anywhere else giving a business money is made easy! In the past they had a much larger variety of phones and tablets to play with to see what you really like. The staff knew just about everything there was in terms to the applications of the devices and, assisted you with how to use your smart phone or tablet features. Now that is not so much the case.

They no longer have at&t Sony Phones or Tablets, a shame because when I got my Sony Xperia Ion (2011) it was by far the best smart phone around in every aspect including durability. The Samsung phones are less capable and, if you drop them out of your pocket on to pavement, you will need a new phone! The new Sony phones have 4K screens and, the most powerful mobile processors but, at&t does not sell them.

Back to customer service, I get the impression that the at&t employees are getting told by management to minimize their interactions with the customers as much as possible. Who came up with this bad idea? This is West Hollywood where being outgoing is an asset! It was a wonderful woman who worked at at&t West Hollywood who showed me how to instantly post pictures in google reviews on the spot with my Sony Xperia Ion, more like her needed.</review>

<Text>I waited 25 minutes before anybody even addressed me and when I finally asked how long it was going to be I was not given an answer and told I just had to wait. I thought that was very rude and I actually drove to a different AT&T store where my matter was handled in less than 2 minutes.
When you see a customer patiently waiting it's not a bad idea to let them know that you won't be very long or to at least acknowledge you on some level which they failed to do</Text><Time>1569103978623< /Time><userid>118231294214957564512< /userid>< response>

<Text>They have great deals. Much better prices than the other phone stores. At&t is reasonable and fair compared to the other ones. The staff is helpful and professional + friendly. Only when it comes to more complicated issues then the people who work there has limited knowledge. I wish there were more experts working there who could help fixing general phone issues.</Text>< name>

The employees at this location are incompetent. I needed to switch to a different service within ATT and no one could help. I then called the customer service and was told that the switch could and should have been done in store. I then needed a new SIM card and after 20 minutes of “experts” figuring it out, the employees could not  help. Useless!!!!< /Text>

I have completely lost trust in AT&T. I split off from my father’s plan over 2 years ago (he has been with AT&T since the Cingular days, with 10+ lines for his business.) I went into the corporate store location at 1112 N La Brea Ave in West Hollywood last week to add a line to my account. It was very simple - I was told that my plan would have to be changed from a single line unlimited plan to a multi-line unlimited plan. I was worried about changing the plan, so I asked repeatedly for the rep to confirm that no functionality of my phone would change, and that I would have the same unlimited plan. I was promised that everything would be the same, I would just have the additional line access fee for the new line.

I was traveling for business a few days later and needed to tether to my phone from my laptop to send a few emails. I could not find the hotspot settings in my phone! Assuming this was an error, I called AT&T. I was told that the new plan did not include a hotspot. I couldn’t believe this, as it was reiterated again and again that I was not “downgrading” my plan. I literally couldn’t believe that this was truly the case, so I texted the rep who I worked with (he gave me his card and circled his cell number on it) and he blatantly lied to me and told me that “we went over the hotspot options” and I agreed to downgrade my plan. This is a typical bait-and-switch tactic and SUPER shady. I absolutely did not expect this from AT&T. I’m not here to waste time - if we had that conversation, why would I be so surprised that I no longer have hotspot access?

So now my only option is to pay an additional $25/mo plus tax in order to upgrade my plan to the “premium” option, which includes hotspot through my phone. That would bring my total monthly cost to about $150/mo, while I can get 4 lines of unlimited with hotspot access through t-mobile for $120/mo! I’m really not happy about this. I will be returning the new phone and canceling my entire plan. I hate knowing that a company my family has trusted (and paid!) for almost 20 years is so willing to be dishonest and rip me off.< /Text>

My review has everything to do with the customer service I received from the sales associate or lack there of. A few positives: The store was clean; and the employees look presentable.

I wanted to port from my carrier to AT&T and told the associate that. He said that I needed two forms of ID (Drivers License and Passport) and a valid major credit card (Not a debit card linked to a bank). Who walks around Los Angeles with 2 forms of ID on them. Also since when do you have to have a Credit Card to get a line of service? I've never heard of anyone having to do that to get service. I had my Drivers License and I even had my American Express and Chase Reserve but I wasn't going home to get a Passport and I have a CA Drivers License. He said "Nope that's the policy. Honestly I felt like it was a bit of "Shopping black judgement; wouldn't be the first time I've had it happen to me!" I told him "Best Buy is across the street I'm just going to go across the street and get the service." He said "That's out policy. I said okay. I walked across the street. I handed Best Buy my Drivers License; they performed my Credit Check. I also opened a Best Buy Credit Card in the process. I got my Iphone XS Max, some Airpods and a screen protecter and the Apple Care and paid for it with my Amx without an issue.

I'm not sure if this is really your policy but if it is; it's counterproductive to how people actually go about life. Nobody carries two forms of ID with them at a given time. If it's not; I would sit down and train your sales associates. You lost  a sale because of it.

I went to the store on Beverly and La Cienega to buy something because it was close to the office and they were super nice. Def will go to that location if I need future assistance.</Review>

Excellent. To all travellers/tourists out there if you need a mobile provider - look no further. AT&T has it all - great reception, LTE/4G coverage in most areas.

This particular store was fantastic. A guy named Jesse helped us. Efficient, courteous and knowledgable. An absolute credit to the store. Great work...<//text>

First time at an AT&T store, and it was a terrible experience. The person that helped me, who's name i can't remember was rude and aggressive. She seemed to be offended by a simple question in regards to one of the work stations in the store. I wanted to know what the difference was between being put on the quo and walking up to the station I was asking about. Her response was " i don't know what their talking about, i just got back from lunch. Playing dumb, obviously i wasn't expecting her to know the details of the conversation, that was just her way of avoiding the question. Not sure why she would take that approach.<//text>

Highly upset they closed the Support Center. That was such a helpful source. I didn't know they closed in December and they said to come in anyway so they can try to help. No one is knowledgeable like the Support team was and basically just tried to sell sell sell. I have been with AT&T since they were at&t and cingular. AT&T bring this back to this location!<//Review>

< Review>
I came in to att because they were having a promo on two lines.  I'm a little concerned abo it sharing a line with someone because it's in my name but was ready to upgrade the phone. I got the note 8 and haven't used the whole phone and love it.  The battery lasts almost over a day on this phone!! Also I did play around with the screen settings to get that
The person signing me up was very friendly and did a great job signing me up.  The only two things that went wrong was I had to restart the phone to get the 4g to come up and I wasn't told.  Even tho I gave them my new address and older address got saved in  the profile.   I didn't notice this in the until I got home and saw it in the contract because I gave her the right address.   There online computer says it has to be 30 days to get it fixed so may have to talk to the manager.  The only issue on will have staying with att will be the second line.  I think I may stay even if it can't workout with the person I'm sharing it with and just cancel the line.  Coming over from mobile I already think I like att more than T-Mobile!!

The manager of this store me Hermandez is actually really great with customers.   It's nice to finally see a manager creating customers which is so lacking in any la store.  She was able to fix my account and gave me great service on my account!!<//Review>

Had an awful customer experience here - they sold me a broken phone and then tried to charge me a $25 restocking fee to return it. Claudia the manager was rude and unreasonable. I ended up going to the AT&T store on Wiltern and Western and they returned the phone without a restocking fee and without a problem. Avoid this store at all costs.</text>

(Translated by Google) Good afternoon,

Today I bought a cell phone in this store and they treated me super well.

The service was excellent, they spoke to me in Spanish and explained everything to me with great patience and cordiality.

Thank you very much
