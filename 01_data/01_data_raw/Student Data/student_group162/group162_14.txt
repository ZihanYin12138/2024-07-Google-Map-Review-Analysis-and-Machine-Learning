Linda is the best. I wont let anyone else do my nails. And Janny delivers the best pedicures. My personal drwam team.  The onwer Thuy is the greatest.  I love her energy. 5 stars all around.

I would try to avoid the nail tech named Melissa. Her work is basic and not neat. You are literally better off doing them yourself. My nails ended up being clumpy/bubbly and the whole appointment was rushed. I have gone here twice and ironically both times, I have been lucky to get her (sarcastically) and both times I wasn't pleased with the outcome. However, when I went once before with my mother her nails were done beautifully by a different nail tech and I guess she is the sister of the owner. It really depends on who you get and definitely it was my fault for allowing her to do my nails a second time when I didn't like the job before.  It could also depend on your standards. But the first time I had chrome and the second time it was a basic gel nail color. So, I don't recommend her at all especially if you want to charge almost the same my nail tech charges and she does celebrity clients and very incredible work.</Text>

Felicia and Ashley are great technicians.  They are professional and friendly.  I would recommend "The Cosmo Studio", the prices are reasonable and a vast color selection.<//Review>

<Name>Michelle Onwualu<//Name><user>112175664016438297199< /user><pictures>None<//pictures><Review>I usually don’t write bad reviews. I just won’t return to the business, but in this case I must. I have contemplated going to this shop for awhile and the first time I went, all was good (normal mani/pedi). I even referred my family and they did their nails here too. But the next time, I was sadly disappointed by the service I received when the first nail technician failed to apply my gels properly. I had to come back 2 days later because the gel was lifting. When I returned, they had someone who was in training and being coached through the gel application process work on my nails (they didn’t even redo all of my nails, they just sanded down the old gel and reapplied paint). I had to come back again 2 days later because this “redo” started to lift as well. Finally on my 3rd visit to correct the 2nd try, they started over. All the while, I told them I was getting this done for a wedding.

I asked for them to compensate me in the form of a discounted pedicure for my time being wasted as they are professionals and this is a paid service. It should never take a nail salon 3 times to get gel manicures right. When I asked for a discount on my next pedicure, the supervisor on duty said it was “out of their range” to do so. It should be out of your range to have a client return to your shop, not once, not twice, but 3 times and not offer a discount on their next service. This will be the last time I ever come to your establishment and I will never refer anyone to your business again.< /Review>< date>

I would try to avoid the nail tech named Melissa. Her work is basic and not neat. You are literally better off doing them yourself. My nails ended up being clumpy/bubbly and the whole appointment was rushed. I have gone here twice and ironically both times, I have been lucky to get her (sarcastically) and both times I wasn't pleased with the outcome. However, when I went once before with my mother her nails were done beautifully by a different nail tech and I guess she is the sister of the owner. It really depends on who you get and definitely it was my fault for allowing her to do my nails a second time when I didn't like the job before.  It could also depend on your standards. But the first time I had chrome and the second time it was a basic gel nail color. So, I don't recommend her at all especially if you want to charge almost the same my nail tech charges and she does celebrity clients and very incredible work.<//text>

< Review>
So, they are appointment only. Doesn't say this any where on Yelp.  I also called twice before coming just to check and no one answered the phone.  I wasted an uber and had to leave right away. Please update your info.< /Review>

<text>I usually don’t write bad reviews. I just won’t return to the business, but in this case I must. I have contemplated going to this shop for awhile and the first time I went, all was good (normal mani/pedi). I even referred my family and they did their nails here too. But the next time, I was sadly disappointed by the service I received when the first nail technician failed to apply my gels properly. I had to come back 2 days later because the gel was lifting. When I returned, they had someone who was in training and being coached through the gel application process work on my nails (they didn’t even redo all of my nails, they just sanded down the old gel and reapplied paint). I had to come back again 2 days later because this “redo” started to lift as well. Finally on my 3rd visit to correct the 2nd try, they started over. All the while, I told them I was getting this done for a wedding.

I asked for them to compensate me in the form of a discounted pedicure for my time being wasted as they are professionals and this is a paid service. It should never take a nail salon 3 times to get gel manicures right. When I asked for a discount on my next pedicure, the supervisor on duty said it was “out of their range” to do so. It should be out of your range to have a client return to your shop, not once, not twice, but 3 times and not offer a discount on their next service. This will be the last time I ever come to your establishment and I will never refer anyone to your business again.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<text>i used to be a chunk skeptical about the price of this gym and i have to inform you that i used to be impressed with at the size of the gym and all of the equiptment which incorporates ellipticals, unfastened weights, electricity plate, bikes seriously this vicinity is fantastic.  It beats EQUINOX over the park, seriously  this vicinity is wonderful, positive it does not have towel carrier or an overpriced juice bar, but I left with a splendid impression of this location.< /text>< rating>

<response>None< /response><Review>Place is kept clean and they have a good selection of machines to work out on. Coming in and out of there the staff is friendly and easy going. The music might be my favorite part, they play classic alternative punk; Blink 182, All American Rejects, etc. Devon, one of the staff members there, was very helpful. All in all, definitely gonna keep coming back. Side note, I live in Los Angeles , that's a hell of a drive if it wasn't a good place to work out.< /Review><rating>4<//rating>< UserId.>

<Review>I was a bit skeptical about the price of this gym and I have to tell you that I was impressed with at the size of the gym and all the equiptment which includes ellipticals, free weights, power plate, bikes seriously this place is awesome.  It beats EQUINOX over the park, seriously  this place is awesome, sure it does not have towel service or an overpriced juice bar, but I left with a great impression of this place.</Review>< pics>

Was a member of this gym for a few years and just recently ended my business with them on a sour note.

Positives: usually not too busy, has what you need for a decent workout, nice array of classes.

Negatives: locker room needs it’s own section; only one shower ever works and is usually clogged so you end up standing in a pool of murky gym water, the sauna is ALWAYS out of order. There is a perpetual smell of sewage and usually a urinal filled with unflushed urine that won’t go down.

Ceiling leaks, be sure to stay away from the electrical box that is normally right underneath a large leak.

You rate will magically go up and they’ll blame it on “tax cuts” which makes no sense.

If you ever decide you want to cancel your membership you can expect a non response from the email they direct you to until they’ve squeezed another month’s payment out of you. Reminder, they want 30 days notice (ridiculous) and in my case they agreed to refund me my money but it’s been a couple weeks now and I’ve yet to see anything hit my account so I’m not holding out hope.

I advise you to take your business elsewhere.<//Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>I bought a Living Social deal for 2 months of unlimited classes for $29, and it was a good deal. The gym is spacious and has plenty of new equipment, as well as a small sauna in the locker rooms. The instructors for the classes are really energetic and cool, and they know what they're doing as far as fitness, especially Ralph. They offered me a free training session with a personal trainer (they offer it to all new members), which I declined but they insisted I should just do, so I did. Afterwards the trainer was extremely pushy in trying to convince me to buy future sessions with her, and I just really don't want to be force sold something when I want to work out on my own. They are shady with billing as they told me I was on a month-to-month membership, and yet they signed me up for automatic payments without notifying me. The only way I found out is because they emailed me a bill with a past due charge and a late fee after they couldn't charge my debit card because it had expired. They are owned by ASF International Corporation and they operate with corporate shady politics. Go to your local independent gym with trustworthy policies.<//text>< GmapID>

Very basic but meets my needs more than a large chain gym.  Really needs another squat rack.< /text>

A friend took me here and i took my mom for early Valentine's dinner. Chicken tikki masala is the best ever. Lamb dish and eggplant in the middle all served with rice. We ordered gaelic naan and some whole wheat bread also. They served complementary green tea ice cream. Highly recommend this authentic place.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXdD3qVE-0rNY22Nfb4Vfm-6MsY-juIKkjcwFT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2FFziPqhFH7kicRTQgeQFi65v8vyZ_XsoCqBu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf192475db4b:0x31ffe5a0b4f46a63</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

weren’t as thick as I’m used to at other places, but we enjoyed every bite—just the right amount of flavor and heat—ordered way too much food and couldn’t stop going back for more bites—we are so happy to have delicious Indian food in Costa Mesa! The staff was kind and helpful and our order was executed perfectly! We will go regularly based on this wonderful experience :D<//review>< Pics>

I was just there today for the lunch buffet and didn’t really enjoy it. However it’s ok for the price paid at $9.99. The naan bread was the most delicious part of the meal. Very fresh. The buffet itself needs a lot of improvement. It didn’t taste fresh and the flavor wasn’t good. Most of the dishes were watery (see photo of butter chicken). Most of the tables were dirty and the host lady (owner?) was on the phone the entire time while seating us. I had questions regarding the dairy content and she was answering it in a very complicated manner because she wouldn’t get off the phone and was distracted. The older male chef was very polite. The place needs to improve their service and quality.<//text>

One of the worst Indian takeouts I’ve ever had. My particular dish was too liquidy. Furthermore my naan was soaked in oil and breaking apart.< /text>

Been coming here for years. Always good food, spicy, and service is always great. Prices are good too. It’s not the best Indian food but it’s definitely a go to when I don’t want to drive far and I’m craving Indian food. Very authentic. And best bang for your buck compared to other places. A solid place to eat regularly.< /Review>

Pretty good. I think they over charged me though. I wanna say lunch buffett was $11.99 or so and my invoice said about $14.99... I live in Vegas so I wasn't gonna complain about $3... But I guess this is my chance! 😛

It's definitely set in a strange shopping center. Slightly hard to find. Decent food though. Home cooked Indian style.< /review>

Bhindi masala - food poisoning! It was super old veggies which lead me to hospital. I’m super surprised how come they are open. I’m still not healed & didn’t had energy to type in this review. The food I bought was on 5th of March. Please don’t do this to anyone else, by selling old food which looks nice after frying it!</review>

Wonder food, great! Haven't been back to Mother India for 20+ years after moving out of the area. Was happily surprised that they are still open and the food was a wonderful as when I went there as   when we were at UCI! Same owners, too. Family run business for all these years. Great vegetarian selections. Will go back again.</review>

The price is reasonable for buffet. There are items for both vegetarian and non vegetarian. The buffet is not grand but it is good for lunch. Service might be a bit slow during busy lunch time and the place is tight so try to get there early or later. Not sure if all items will be available if you arrive later< /Review>

I came right when they closed for lunch, but the gentleman let me in anyways. The service was excellent, my waiter constantly checking up on me and refilling my beverage. He even brought out fresh garlic naan just for me. The food is extremely good; I would have paid more for the buffet. The only negative is that the selection was somewhat limited, otherwise it would have received 5 stars. All in all this is a great place for lunch, and I will be a repeat customer< /review>

<Review>We are not locals, we are from New Jersey and were driving through the area while on a trip to LA and San Diego over the Xmas holidays. We were looking for an Indian restaurant that served decent food without charging an arm and a leg. Mother India far exceeded our expectations.

The buffet was very moderately priced at $9.99 per person. We had two kids, but they didn't charge us for the 5 year old, that was very nice of them.

The food was very good, very authentic north Indian style, cooked as if you are cooking for guests at your home (as opposed to using excessive oil and spices). The best part was the naans - plain and garlic naans, freshly made and served at our table.

If we were locals, we would have definitely made this a regular event. We will be back here, if we are ever in this area.< /Review>< Date>

<Text>I left out with no options otherwise I would have rated it in nagative because

1. Worst food, better to starve than eating here

2. Least care about customers

3. It’s not called as buffet, they just arrange all the left out food from store

Worst food.
It is waste to go there, even food is $11. You can give this money to a poor guy instead of this place.
There are other good India places in Irvine and cost almost same like $12-14.
So do not go there.<//text>

We were here for Lunch on a weekend and do our disbelief there wer just a few people and the food trays were not full. Probably they see less crowd that's why.
So we helped ourselves with the items in the tiny buffet and I don't remember if I like any of the items. They were not hot and most of the dishes were bland. We had Yelp checkin reward of free lassi and the lady would give just one per table.. (What the Fish). Well after asking her again she made 3 glasses out of 1 and its was very lite tasting mango lassi.
This place needs to get some hot dishes and also add some spice to the curries especially chicken ones.</Review>

Outstanding authentic Indian food.  The only slight miss is the sag paneer.  Missing some spices, and wish it would be palak paneer.

Highly attentive staff.   I eat Indian food around the world, and this place is outstanding.</text>

<Time>1559182044561</Time><Review>Amazing ambiance makes this place very instagrammable. Lots of games too so hours tend to fly by really quickly here, alas it closes at 8 pm daily... Currently offering free toppings up to half a glass, which amounts to about 5 servings of toppings. Drinks and toasts as good as they get.< /Review>< pics>

<text>Good variety of choices with  caffeine and caffeine free drinks like hot and cold  teas, smoothies, and shaved ice. Additionally, there is a large variety of toppings like bobba among others.  They also have appetizer foods that can serve as a light fare or small meal. They have added a small knick knacks shop within the cafe which is a great idea to have in an area that used to have a table or two and was not inviting for having no windows.   The decor is vintage with a nice variety of old appliances and games.  Unisex bathrooms are available as well as dog water bowls outside the door in the terrace area.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0DFwjcG8d0igwQF2RlwsudTRJRfyBLIJVWMwc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOp0WXS9ytBXfK0aZyh5V3tqo3Pso0Ol5mYX6Yt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhmBx3Zh7kYvY2vqBl1_cMPMCrIJzgqWoZ7BuP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMin-gyzhRRyHR78MyuWjp_JcNZu4VFyWKtdXSF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDkumO14m9XLBdQhK_-XyazhfcYk-Hh1SnSUg-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrM_IlVnIRD0qnD5yYP8_sanvSAv-wsfixnZwi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2dbe4e6dd60ad:0x87af03958f968abb</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

One of the better Half and Half locations. Lots of parking, rarely full, massive toppings selection, and helpful staff. And of course, tasty milk tea!

t'was also the first Half and Half location I noticed the emphasis on wooden, down-home, kind of charming decor at, as opposed to the somewhat more modern decor that dominates the Monterey Park and the San Gabriel locations (or the City of Industry ones, too).</Text>

<Text>H&H good time is better (price wise) but the express stops are great for a pickup. This location is inside a strip mall with BofA. Way in the back. They went overboard with the Wes Anderson decor, which is cool. Drinks are good, same menu as the others.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Review>Of all the Half and Half locations, this is the least busy and in my mind, the best. My personal favorites, the coffee milk tea and green bean slush are consistently good here and the lower foot traffic means you can customize your drinks and it'll always be made just the way you ask for it.< /Review><user_name>Matthew Foong< /user_name></record>

Went there on a hot day.  Drinks are good and large.  It's noisy there because music is playing all day.  It's usually too loud.  I prefer buying a drink and driving home.< /Text>

I really like this Half and Half location although it does take a bit of a drive to get there. The interior is nicely decorated with lots of cute decorations and furniture. The drinks are the same quality as Monterey Park's Half and Half. I feel like the price is decent for the quality of the drink.

I usually order the iced milk with boba, caramel, and pudding, which is always made the exact same way. The boba is always chewy and sweet and the drinks are always on point.</text>

<review>Half and Half has done a great job with maintaining consistency throughout the chain. My favorite drink is the iced milk drink with grass jelly and honey boba. The boba itself is fresh and sweet, which is the key to any amazing drink. This location has a cool vibe. It is half boba shop and half movie set.< /review>< Date>

Excellent And Speedy Service, Prices Are High, However The Staff Is Very Friendly And It Is Extemely Clean Inside And OutSide, The re Are Good Vibes All Around And It Is Always Nice And Cool Inside Even In The 101 degrees Summer Heat

I've only been here once, where I got a sea salt crema oolong tea with boba. Pretty much every time I go back to LA, I can't stop thinking about this place. The honey/brown sugar boba is sooo yummy and special. And their drinks are weird and interesting and delicious. If there was one closer to me, I'd definitely gain weight from going every day!<//review><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<Text>i am practically a boba addict, so when i visited LA a few months ago, i was very excited to try half and half. perhaps it was overhyped, but i was very disappointed! i'm a big fan of quality teas, and half and half just doesn't have that. it was overly sweet and the boba consistency was just mediocre. i may give it another shot next time, so we shall see!<//Text>< Pics>

******BEWARE******

Check your bank account,  if you use your debit card.
The day I got my nails done the amount charged to my card was correct. Three days later the amount was changed. The owner returned the difference when I returned and showed her my receipt and bank account information. No apologies....<//text>

I love Van’s Nails.  Impeccable customer service with CDC restrictions and recommendations followed closely.  As a customer this practice coupled with great work makes me feel comfortable coming here, even during a pandemic. They are doing a wonderful job!</review>

The WORST experience I have ever had. To begin with, I got a tech that I was confused if it was a male or female. The techs nails looks like they work in construction and not in a nail salon. The tech was extremely aggressive at taking off my acrylic nails, it was the worst pain, and even took off my natural nail and could see the skin underneath. I was referred to this place from a co-worker. But will never come here again. I was still charged at the lousy and painful job of taking my acrylics off. DO NOT COME HERE, they will ruin your nail beds.</text>

<Text>I walked into this shop at about 4pm and asked for a manicure, full set, and a pedicure. They asked me to wash my hands, then brought me to a chair and table in the back. The chair was facing sideways so I turned it around, but the woman doing my nails had me turn it back around sideways and I had to twist my body around for her to do my nails. Then I man came with a bucket of soapy water with some black specks floating in it and asked summoned for me to put my feet in, but the woman doing my nails didn’t stop, so I had to take my shoes off with my feet and was not able to roll up my pants he proceeded to pull up a stool thing and asked me to put my feet up on it. So here I am twisted to the side with my feet up higher than where I was sitting. It was really uncomfortable and I am flexible. The man doing my feet did not wear gloves and basically cut them, did some brief cuticle removal and painted them with gel then precariously balanced the uv light on his knee and the stool over my toe while my hands and arms were still stretching to reach the woman doing my nails. It was like a circus act, I cannot believe they thought this was ok. The man doing my toes finished painting, doused them in cuticle oil then sprayed them with water. Then he put lotion on and without gloves proceeded to just move his hand around my leg and foot no massaging, he actually dropped my whole leg a couple times so he could talk. My leg was so stretched and uncomfortable and I felt like I was going to fall out of the chair. He finished, said thanks and walked away. The woman doing my nails did ok, but they look really bad, there are places she missed and places the I’ve light missed because I could barely reach it. Bad bad bad experience and I paid $56 total plus a $14 tip.</Text>< Name>

Please don’t use this place! They destroyed my nails. They broke my real nails off above the skin and caused severe pain and bleeding.<//text>

I just left this place VERY BAD service!! I went for my lashes and they glued my eyes shut completely and when tried to open the lady was carelessly yanking them to open and i told her she was hurting me and when i tried moving her hands she STILL kept yanking them open! I asked if they could just take them off and they ignored me and brought another lady in to the room to do her lashes😡i was kind at first about it and when they told me to leave like that i was very angry! Another thing is they glue it to your skin not your lashes VERY BAD!<//text>

<review>I visited this shop on several  occasions over the years. As usual long wait times even with my appointment van made me wait over an hour for our scheduled service. Please was not clean and I had to tell them to clean there equipment before touching me. Van left two my toes bleeding tremendously from picking in them over and over. I had to tell her to stop because I noticed the the bleeding as she acted as if she didn’t notice. Very unprofessional, horrible costumer service , appointments are made to wait for other clients with no appointments and they will make you bleed and try and infect you from not cleaning anything properly.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

I guess you get what you pay for. Here is a $12 full set. She applied the acrylic much thicker than I would have liked and they charge more for longer and different shapes. @misadventuresofmary< /text>

< Review>
Worst nail salon & horrible customer service! I saw nail tech lee today for a simple fill for ombré nails. The whole time she was filling my nails yet not even looking! She ended up cutting my finger. I asked her to pay attention. Then she claimed she couldn’t finish the fill on my nails. Something I thought would have been the simplest task ever! Poor customer service & horrible quality my nails weren’t even filed evenly smh I’m going to see if I can report them to the better business beauru< /Review>

<Review>This was the worst experience I’ve ever had at a nail salon. Me and my friend went to get our nails done here for her birthday. I got a full set and a pedicure and it took the guy only 25 minutes to do my entire full set, not to mention he cut my thumb very badly and I started bleeding. My nails are uneven, they’re crooked, they’re rough in the middle. I had to file them myself just to somewhat fix them. My friend’s nails are also uneven and when she asked them to fix them, they were very rude.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>I usually never have a real problem going here. My nails are only $35 --- its cheap and it is what I can expect for $35... However I got my nails done recently by the young girl with short hair and tattoos. She looked like she REALLY did not want to be there. She did my nails very rough and sloppy. She did a very quick job, like she was just trying to get this over with. She even MADE a phone call in the middle of doing my nails. Her service was so bad. She definitely needs to learn some skill from the other women working there as well. I will not be returning.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Went with reco
mmendations from my hairdresser.  The cost is inexpensive but the techs are very rude. I went to Harley several times and she had a hard time saying Hello,was veryrough
and didn't like you to rake any suggestions.  I am a good tipper and she never said thank you. Not returninh.<//review>

I regret going to this nail place,  first time and will never go back!!! I was so upset! Went to get my nails done for a Quinceallera in Port Hueneme the day before the party 10/21/2016..The following morning, the day of the event my gel nail was bubbling and started peeling!! I called them right away and they told me "that usually happens with gel paint,  but don't worry come in and I'll fix it"
Helllooooo!! I'm 4 hrs away!! I was so upset,  I was crying!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL!!<//Review>

My favorite nails place to go to. Van always does wonderful work. I bring her some tough designs sometimes and she always finds away to please her customers. I highly recommend Vans.<//Review>

<Review>Usually my girlfriend spends around 45 minutes to get a full set done, well today I took her in to Vans nails to get a full set and the person who attended her spent around 10-15 minutes to do them! Before they applied the color they made her wash her hands, & while she was doing that the person was already cleaning her area as if she was done for the day! The person who did the nails accidentally cut my girlfriends finger and didn’t even bother to say sorry, they simply ignored the fact they they cut her.This person was in rush to do these nails, my girlfriend paid 35$ for these nails and they are the worst nails she has ever gotten!< /Review>< Name>

I will never go back! Went in for a simple gel polish, charged me $17, got upset when I didn’t tip, then my polish came off two days later! Glad I didn’t tip, upset I paid that much for what doesn’t even seem to be gel!</review>

<text>Went here with my mom and future sister in law. We were last minute walk-ins but they still accepted us.  Three gel manicure/spa pedicures. It was funny, my team (Kim/Jenny) won even though I was the last one to get worked on. :P they were fast and wonderful. We will visit again after my mom's trip to Europe! :D< /text></record>

I usually go to Helens nails but my pedicure lady was out of town and my birthday was on the 25th and I came in to Vans on the 22nd. I was getting a pedicure and asked Van herself if they can do something specific I wanted and showed her a picture. She said "anything you show us we can do." I was so excited! So the guy who did my pedicure looked so confused on what he was doing but I gave the benefit of the doubt because I liked the massage chair . He then asked me if I wanted gel...I said no. He did gel anyways. I said okay...fine...never had gel before I'll let it slide. He started painting them and he had no idea what he was doing. Van had to actually sit there and paint them. Then the lady doing my nails told me for what I wanted, and the gel toes everything would be $72. I said okay. Fine. Since she wanted to remove my old nails and start fresh. As she was doing them I kept telling her what I wanted and she kept saying "this way better" then she said she was going to do my nails thinner because thicker "is not better " so I said I like them thicker they last longer. Again she said "This way better " and did what she wanted anyways. Not even 3 days later (the day of my birthday) the sides on both sides of my right thumb nail started cracking. I don't do crazy work. I type. That's all I do. Then the left thumb nail started cracking in the same place on the same sides just on my left nail. Now...not even a FULL 2 weeks later the nail is completely split and cracked but won't come all the way off because it is in the MIDDLE of my nail. I basically cannot use my thumbs except for giving a thumbs up! Which in this case I am giving a HUGE 2 thumbs down!!!!!! Not only did I NOT get what I wanted the lady who did my nails told me it was $92 and she miscalculated.....but she didn't tell me until AFTER she was done and it was time to pay. So NOW I have to go somewhere else, to get my nails the way I want, fixed and done PROFESSIONALLY BEFORE 2 weeks...at Helens I go a MONTH before having to get my nails done again.... worst experience ever.... I won't ever come here again.<//text>

<text>WORST EXPERIENCE IVE EVER HAD! My sister and I came her and got full sets two weeks later we go for a fill. First they are very rude. About a week later one of my nails breaks off, i notice that my nails were green so i popped the rest of my nails off and the rest were green. She told me to wash my hands and she said it would come off so i did and it never came up and i came to the place and they were being so rude and i asked for the manager she said it’s her but she refused to give me her name and then i asked again and she said she was not the manager and then we asked everyone else and they were all quite. they yelled at us and kicked us out.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>5</Rating><date>1527198617440< /date><response>None</response><Text>Holly fixed a broken nail (Freehand without a tip glued on) and did my nails EXACTLY how I wanted them. A lot of places try to make your nails long as possible  so you need a fill sooner. She aims to please and took the time to get to know me. She understood that I needed short and not sharp nails because I have a baby. For a fill with gel and to fix the nail it cost 22 dollars, a fraction of what I was paying at California nail design. She was gentle and never hurt me or cut me. Also, she made sure to file the nails in a way so they looked and felt natural, making them thinner at the edges and not so thick. Definitely went the extra mile to make sure everything was correct If you don't want to wait come in right when they open. The later it gets the busier it is.<//Text></record>

I use to always get my nails done here with the girls in my family and had no problem until I went to get them done for my baby shower. Asked for full set all blue and when I was on going through my day I realized it looked as if bubbles of nail polish have popped and the nails were burnt! So I went back and she fixed them and said it was because of the UV light. WRONG. It happened AGAIN. I went back and they were rude about it. Never going back and they lost many long time customers< /review>

They rush you and talk smack if you ask them to fix something. Extremely rude. The nails overall aren't good because of how quickly they do them. SO careless. They cut skin off of my thumb and it began slightly bleeding but no one seemed to care besides me. The lady just wiped it away with her thumb which is not only unsanitary for the salon considering she did someone else's nails right after mine without washing her hands, but unsanitary for me as well. Her hands were full of nail dust so I'm hoping my cut doesn't get infected. I read the reviews and even though they were bad, I wanted to give them a chance. I regret it and will never be going back.< /text>

<name>Jessica S<//name><text>When we began the lady asked me to cut my nails as she walked off. I repeat she asked me to cut my nails!!!! STOP❌ At that point I thought about walking out! I decided to stay because I thought maybe she asked because my nails were so healthy. I was in a rush, but I didn't let her know.. I asked for a full set & a toe polish only. My price for my hands were $23 she told me gel would bring it up $4 somehow her price turned out to be $30. I guess she thought I couldn't count.
Then I asked her how much for a toe polish & cut. She told me $4 for polish $6 for polish&cut. The cut should have been free! I cut my nails when I walked in.. She could've gave me the clippers to cut my toes. Another lady polished my toes & instead charged me $1 extra for the cut. My toes were fine but think about it the other lady tried charging me an extra $1 why???? Ok back to my full set. My nails were not the look I requested. I asked her the look of the black nails in the 3rd picture & the color of the 4th pic. When the lady applied the acrylic it attached to my skin. It burned!!!! She told me I had sensitive skin.. NOT!!! My nails were done every two weeks years back with no problem from a different shop! At the end the matte she applied dried with missing spots! I asked her to fill in spots! She told me to come back tomorrow I told her I could not! She fixed a few spots! She told me she had no more matte! I knew her coworker had matte so I asked she told me no basically the owner doesn't give them anymore for the day once they run out! 😕Like what? That's not my fault! I felt like she lied the entire time I was there! It was hot & I was just ready to go! When I left I just thought about how much I didn't like my nails! Never going to Van's again!!! The older lady ruined it! I paid $23 for my hands & $5 for my toes. I should've got $23 back! If van doesn't contact me & personally do my nails for free! Then I know the shop is just overall bad!! I been to the shop when they first opened they use to do what you asked but back then it was only Van & 2 other ladies. Bad experience!<//text>< time>

Took my daughter here, to get her nails done for senior prom. My oldest daughter referred this place and scheduled the appointment, with her nail tech, Lynda. We arrived 10 minutes early, a miracle for me. We asked for Lynda, receive a reply she's busy. No worries, we will wait. She asked what did we want. My daughter replies, a full set.

I'm thinking, all is well. The lady finish the person sitting and tells my daughter to pick out her nail polish colors. I replied, were waiting for Lynda. She says, Lynda here only does pedicure. I asked does she work here? She replies, yes. Then I'll wait.

She says, "No you angey, you got an attitude, go across the street. I said lady we had an appointment with a referral and I'm not giving just anyone my money, nor an appointment important as this. Prom is a big deal!

Needless to say. I took my senior, down the street, she was very pleased.

My daughter called and told yhe owner (I had no idea she was the owner). She said, they asked for wrong person. LIES! The owner of this establishment was very rude. Until she found out, I was an African American business owner, in the community. Van's  lost a long-term client,  my oldest and friends. Customer Service should always be your #1 concern.< /Text>

<review>I literally came here every 2 weeks. I was only disappointed a couple times. I went to my regular 2 week fill and i was given the chick with the short hair and tattoos. Never had her before but first as she roughly starts my hands, her phone was constantly going off. She picked up her phone each time. One was a text and as i glanced at her phone, its pictures of some chick. So while there exchanging pictures, im waiting to get my damn nails done. Anyways as she continues to work on my nails she literally did a job of a five-year-old. When she put the new acrylic on I noticed there was still dirt on my fill line. That can cause a major fungus and as I go to tell van about this she looks at it like it's no big deal and just puts nail polish on. The shape was very uneven lumps everywhere, she didn't bother to fill her liquid. The brush she was using had acrylic chunks stuck to the bristles. All in all this lady was very unprofessional and will cause this place to get shut down with the way she does nails because if I wouldn't have said anything I'm sure I would come back with green nails and would sue this place. I am actually going back in 2 days to a different shop and have them removing these nails and get new ones put on. Straight ridiculous</review>< UserId.>

The people are rude and they have prices posted and then they want to charge you something different.  The area that they use for waxing has an old torn sheet for you to lie on.  The floors are dirty.  Please think twice before you go here.  The saying is true you get what you pay for.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< date>

<Text>I had a horrible experience at vans nails they are very rude and were obnoxiously loud. My nails were rushed and didn't turn out good at all. They also didn't clean my nails up before they put on acrylics. It was very hot(no Air conditioning) they had bees flying all around, it was not pleasant at all. I will never be going back and I hope no one else does either</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Awful at doing nails, the only acceptable one is Van, the actual owner, but even she's not all that good. And they have rude workers.<//review>

I needed my hot tub cleaned immediately due to guests arriving for the weekend.  I called and left a voice Mail message for a call back.  Within 30 minutes the hot tub store returned my call and a appointment was scheduled for the next day.  The worker arrived on time. He explained all of the details of the cleaning. And within an hour the job was completed with excellent results.  He pointed out minor items that needed my attention. Excellent service and good customer relations the best.<//review>

<review>First of all I would like to give Bridgett, at the Folsom Hot Tub Store, 5 stars for being professional, responsive and helpful when I purchased my SX Hot Spa tub. She ALWAYS got back to me promptly if I had any questions. If she couldnt answer my questions she would find someone who could.
That said, I will explain why, if I had known what I know now, I would have considered buying a tub from another manufacturer. First of all, the pump failed after about a month. They replaced the pump immediately, which I thought was good. But then, 6 months later, the paint began to peel off of the base. I contacted the service department about it, only to have them tell me "that is not covered by the warranty".  What? Paint peeling within a year? Thats just poor quality that should have been repaired free of charge, without question. Then...a few months later, one of the headrests(they call it a pillow) became blistered with ugly bubbles. Not both pillows, just one. So it wasnt caused by anything I had done (I ALWAYS cover the tub when not in use).  Again, I was told by the service department, "that is not covered by the warranty". And again, that is something that should have been replaced without question. Now I have to pay to have the base repainted (it looks absolutely ugly) and also pay to have the headrest replaced. Thats just poor quality and customer service in my opinion.
Update: The team at the Hot Tub Store has since contacted me and thoroughly resolved all of the issues with my tub to my satisfaction. Thanks to Aaron and Mike in the service department.<//review>< pictures>

Our service team works hard to provide exceptional customer care and always does what they can to get issues taken care of in a timely manner and as cost efficiently as possible. The items covered by the manufacturer warranty are not decided by our team and we will continue to do what we can to work with the manufacturer to get the issues described taken care of. We have shared your valuable feedback with the manufacturer who this review is more appropriately pointed at. We have also reached out to you to get these issues resolved. Hopefully we will be able to earn a full five stars in the end and you will feel better about the quality of the product and about the service we are able to provide.

After several weeks and a terrible experience trying to order a part online for our Caldera Spa, I finally went to the Caldera website which recommended us to the Hot Tub Store West Sacramento.
The experiences were like night and day. I ordered a part online from another dealer only to have my account charge immediately with absolutely no shipping date, expected arrival, tracking info - nothing. I couldn't get hold of a real person. I finally canceled the payment through my bank.
Then I called the Hot Tub Store, left a message about the part I needed and got a call back within a few hours. I ordered the part that day and received it a few days later. They were friendly, efficient and fast!
Thank you!<//Review>

The tech came out in the morning to diagnose the problem. He did not have the necessary part to fix the hot tub. We received a call later that afternoon from the tech who offered to go back to the shop, bring the part back and fix the hot tub. Extraordinarily outstanding service! We were extremely grateful and pleased.</review>

<review>I bought a Clear Water II Ozone System they  installed a 3rd party poorly rate product.
I purchased a Jetsetter in September 2014 with the ACE Saltwater system as a returning customer of Hot Springs Spas.  After a few years I was not completely happy with the saltwater system and based on a recommendation of a Hot Springs Representative at a home show I decided to change to the Clear Water II Ozone System.  I contacted the Hot Springs store in West Sacramento and made arrangements for them to install the Clear Water II system for $200+ or much more.  About a year later the ozone generator stopped working and I discovered that the Watkins Clear Water II ozone generator was not used, they had installed a 3rd party poorly rated generator.  This hurt the level of trust I had with their service department.  After some pushing on my part they determined that they would replace the ozone generator with the Watkins Clear Water II generator at no cost to me.  A few years later our spa started to leak and I called their service department and they told me it would be $140.00 for a service call plus an hourly rate for them to determine what was leaking and to repair the leak.  I figured looking for the leak was something I could do.  After some time, I determined that one of the jets was leaking at the base where it was connected to the spa.  I called the service people back and asked for procedures on how to remove the jet.  I was told “I am sorry, we do not have any technical support options.”  If we talked to customers it would not be cost effective.  Because of the above I would not recommend a Watkins product.</review>< user>

I have purchased 2 HotSprings tubs from the Hot Tub Store.  The first one was over 20 years ago and my wife and I gave it to our daughter and her family for their enjoyment.  We recently purchased a slightly smaller Hot Springs tub.  I am a big fan of the HotSprings brand.  They make a high quality tub with great parts availability should the tub need repair.  I would also highly recommend the Folsom Hot Tub Store.  The staff is very helpful, both for sales and support.  With over a 20 year relationship with the Hot Tube Store, I can honestly say that I never had a hot tub related question or need go unanswered.  Very knowledgeable and helpful staff, I highly recommend them.< /text>

Customer service at hot tub store was great, the delivery crew was amazing and the hot it’s self works great. We have had great after the sale service as well. I have been emailing oour sales person and he has been able to answer my questions and deal with my issues. I highly recommend the hot tub store if you are in the market for a Hot Springs Spa which in my opinion is one of the better spas on the market today.</Text>

< Review>
Never in my life have I been so pleasantly surprised! I called with a problem that I was almost sure they wouldn't be able to help me with, and my jaw dropped when Paul, without hesitation, told me that he would see what he could do.

What he did was to contact one of his manufacturers with my problem, and they agreed to replace the item that I had purchased from The Hot Tub Store nearly 3 years ago. There was never the slightest effort to sidestep the issue. They simply did what was in their power to do to resolve the issue.

God bless The Hot Tub Store, their manufactures, and everybody else that had anything to do with building a company with such a high standard of true customer service. Your ownership and management team should be commended!

Thank you for what you've done. You will forever be my hot tub provider!

You guys are AWSOME!!!

< Review>
Mike Barnes provided me with excellent hot tub service. I love using my salt water prodigy on a daily basis. I've had it for nearly 4 years.

Last week I emptied the water for cleaning and the hot tub would not turn on even though there was full power.

Mike was gracious enough to come on a Saturday, problem solve the electrical issue (under warranty!) and also replaced my ACE cell.

He's a stand-up guy, professional, and knowledgeable. Great product and great service!!!

I LOVE my Hot Springs hot tub!  You can’t go wrong with a top quality hot tub.</Review>

I needed to order a part and wasn’t certain I had the correct one. So she sent me a picture of what the part should look like and then asked me to send a picture of my broken part. When she confirmed it was the correct one then she took my order. I got it the next day. They are always so helpful and patient!<//Review>

I love the vacaville store. Both ladies are very nice and knowledgeable...and willing to do research for me if I ask a question they can’t answer. They have both been helpful on many occasions. And prices are comparable to other places.< /Text>

Everyone at the Hot Tub Store was incredibly helpful & kind.  Really felt like they listened to what we were looking for and we’re shopping with us as if they were a family member.  It’s rare to find an entire group of people so professional and dedicated tour happiness. Thanks Mike, Sue, Dan & the whole staff at the store.

He came right on time. Was very professional. Changed the pump  Unfortunately, the problem with the code HL is still happening and it shut off. I'm working with the manufacturer to diagnose the problem and see if.its actually the thermostat. if that's the case (which is under warranty) I would definitely want you to come out again<//Text>

I would not hesitate to purchase from them again in the futre.  Very honest, upfront and transparant.  Best of all, they are a local family run business.

{'time': 1574704372574, 'text': 'Update:\nNote: several 1 star reviews have been posted here by a truck driver and his friends & associates.  The driver, bringing a load of new spas from the factory in Southern California, did not arrive on time for product to be unloaded while our team was available. We received prior permission from the logistics company to unload the truck when we were open again to do so. We were told the truck driver would be paid to wait. The driver did not like this arrangement.\nWe are sorry the timing did not work well for all parties involved. It was inconvenient for our people also.\nOur company and our employees have done nothing wrong to deserve the driver’s anger and negative reviews being posted by him and his associates. We are in the middle of an inappropriate and immature dispute where this driver has asked his friends to post 1 star reviews to our account.\nWe do sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused this trucker. The issue should really be between him and the logistics company that arranged the contract.\nWe hope everyone will act as adults and move forward.\nThese reviews not posted by our valued customers have been flagged with Google as being a conflict of interest and inappropriate.\nAlways with gratitude,\nThe Hot Tub Store Team'}<//Response>

If you want to sit at the counter, you need to make reservations for it, but my dining partner and I went right when it opened for dinner setting so they were fine with that!  We were the first set and I got all the attention from the chef.

Chef is really passionate about his sake and sashimi collection!  It's clearly displayed at the counter and nigiri is superbly fresh and delightful!  I opted for their Hitachino Japanese beer because I felt like beer more than sake!

The signature wins are his appetizers like his Truffle Chawanmushi!  It was appeasing to the taste buds and smell!  Uni amuse bouche was buttery rich and I couldn't get enough!  I would have preferred for truffle toro to be raw instead of seared. It would have tasted better - textured wise!  Chef took time on telling his background and he came to be in SF.  It was a nice story while dining!

All nigiris were savory and treasured with each mouthful!  I was a bit disappointed that the wagyu truffle nigiri didn't get tossed into my omakase!  I was preoccupied besides requesting for this signature nigiri!  Besides that, omakase for the win here!

Service was lovely!

Lychee sorbet ended the palate - specially flavored and refreshing!< /Text>

Sushi chef Tony Li is totally trash, rude and obnoxious. The sushi he served was surely an industrial pattern made, poured with all different unknown seasonings to cover the original fish taste, not good at all. It was just tossed on the pan and served. I doubt how long they keep the fish. In addition, sushi was ridiculously and shamefully small for its price. This is the first time I am disappointed like this, all for an addition to 60 dollars per person. I can't imagine how they can treat a customer, looks like the chef thought customers will eat whatever he prepares. Waste of money..never step into this place again!</Text>

<Review>It was a great experience! Comparable to sushi sam’s in San Mateo. If you use sushi Sam as a benchmark, some pieces are not as fresh but they make up for it with some delicious appetizers. Uni is also the best I’ve had in the states, and I’ve had pretty good uni before..

Expect to drop some dough here though.<//Review><Name>William Ng< /Name></record>

The fish is served at the perfect temperature. Really attentive service. We called them to ask if we could dine with our baby. They reserved a table for us in a quiet corner and checked in early and often. Promptly gave us the deck when he started stirring. Really thoughtful.

<Review>There is nothing good about this place. The food is average and overpriced for its quality. The service is more than terrible. I had a waitress with absolutely no training who completely screwed up my order, didn't tell me that items were out of stock and could barely communicate. This is bad enough but the other employees didn't care at all. This place clearly doesn't have a training program or any sort of customer satisfaction policy. Just cows at a troth to them.</Review>< pics>

They need to pay more attention to training their staff. Two items from our initial order were forgotten and when we asked about them the first time our server said they were coming. When asked a second time he had to go look into it, but when he came back he said that one plate had been sent to another table and the customers ate it. The other item he just never ordered for us. No apology or correction. Just matter of fact declarations. Then he looked us like he didn't know what to do.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>They serve $50/seat sushi for $100/seat, and those numbers are by SF standards. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but not at the price. If you want this kind of sushi, go to one of a hundred different places in the city for half the price. Or if you want to pay this, then go to any one of the Michelin rated places in walking distance.<//Review><Name>Tony Gentilcore<//Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_id>118178843327307114710</user_id>< response>

Wow. Disappointing is an understatement. Bland and overpriced, I get. But when you pair it with terrible service, it becomes sad. We really wanted to like this place. We have such fond memories of the predecessor place Kiji sushi. Not comparing or being fussy, but Kingza was amateur, rude, and a turn off.</text>

This is a very special restaurant in the city, never really heard about it or read about it. They use fresh fish, good sauce and very professional service. My favorite dish is the a5 wagyu beef.< /Review>

The a la carte menu is reasonably priced and way better quality sushi and sashimi than nearby places with similar prices. They even use real crab in the California rolls. Great value!<//Review>

We ordered Omakase and the entire process took 3 hours. The sushi came super slow. Each piece takes us a long time to wait. In the end, both the Chef and us don’t know how many pieces we had and the meal somehow ended. There are too much wasabi in the nigiri and the fish was not super fresh. Overall, I would not recommend it.</review>

<text>Better than expected. Not looking extravagant like other fancy Omakase places (comparing to my favorite ju-ni) but the flavor profile is rich. Protip: you can ask the chef to put less wasabi into sushi.< /text>< pictures>

<text>Two word summary: underwhelming and inconsistent. C+ student parading as a an A+ student. If the cost were lower, this would be a solid 3. but at this price, the cost/value/quality was 2 stars

We got the Omakase.

Let's start with the good.
- This is a large quantity of food
- Sake was good
- Some of the bites were delicious--especially some surprise hits, including the papaya dish
- Most of the fish was fresh and high quality; even their uni was delicious
- Chef offered a free revisit of one of the nigiri course (while some omakase restaurants charge an additional a la carte fee)

Now the bad.
- The pacing was a mess. It took 18 minutes before we even started. We were sitting at the bar confused and unsure
- The chef who was in front of us was clearly new, and while I'm down for training, it seemed like he was SO green, he didn't know any of the basics. That's disheartening for a $125 meal
- There was a fly in the fish refridgerator. We notified the chefs, and they just sort of gave up
- In the first course, we had uni on top of crab. The uni was delicious however all three of us in our group had crab shell in the crab. We notified the chefs, and they didn't do anything
- when the first course was dropped, no one said anything to us. they didn't explain what we were eating, just dropped it. We had to ask for help
- as we got into the nigiri course, they started with toro -- two rounds of toro-- starting with that heavy and fatty of a fish seems questionable
- The nigiri pieces were dropped on the same piece of wood, and the wiping of the wood only occurred once every three nigiri, so flavors were blending and not in a good way
- they were heavy-handed on the wasabi, and even after we told them that the wasabi was too strong, and they asked for feedback, they didn't change anything
- the fish cuts were extremely inconsistent from person to person; within our group it seemed like each of us was getting a different cuts of the same fish. When we brought this up, we were essentially told we don't understand how fish works
- some of the fish was cut so poorly that it ended up being so chewy that we couldn't even gnaw through. we left those chunks on the plate, and no one said anything
- On one dish, the sticker of the fruit was still left on the fruit, again we brought this up, and nothing happened (not even a courtesy discount or drink or fish or even acknowledgment )
- The hot dishes came at wildly different temps between our group. One person had chawanmushi that was so hot, she could barely eat it. The other two in our group had cold dishes
- They used truffle in EVERYTHING. It was like a trick they couldn't stop performing. It overpowered the fish, and didn't add to the experience. One of the nigiri servings was literally just a ball of rice sprinkled with flecks of shaved truffle. No one needs that.
- the layout of the sushi bar is problematic. The sushi chef kept asking us to move our plates so he could put the fish on them, and occasionally he gave up and just threw pieces of nigiri on to the plate from afar
- the three chefs were not in sync. Sometimes each chef would tell us exactly the same thing. But, they didn't seem to be working together. It was odd to be so close to that dynamic.

Overall this experience was somewhat bizarre. It felt like an impression of a fine sushi experience, but not the real thing. I think it would have been even worse at a table, so I'm glad that we at least were sitting at the bar.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808f7e3e373acf1b:0xaf015a2a0f571f4d<//gmapID></record>

<username>Donna Gomez<//username><Review>Customer Service was excellent. The Manager Martin was very nice and went out of his way to give me a good price on my storage. I was very pleased how he made me comfortable just not over the phone but in person. I would let others know if they are looking for storage to go to A-American Self-Storage I was pleased. I believe it depends on the Manager who works there .Thank you Martin<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Service here has to be top tier. Martin went above and beyond to help me out throughout the whole process. Went in looking for storage, left with a huge smile and a sense of accomplishment due to the amazing service that was provided! Will definitely recommend all my fellow colleagues looking for amazing service at an even more amazing price!<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>The storage is clean, with easy access, and friendly staff. The manager is very nice and professional. He goes the extra mile to get the right size unit for the right price. I have dealt with a few name brand storages and they weren't as professional. I appreciate the service I received and I would recommend this storage.<//Review>< Pics>

Please be very cautious when you store your belongings and valuables here. My families storage was broken into and they have Zero surveillance footage of the incident, they don't even have footage of the day that we brought our belongings in. Apparently the cameras are just for show. You definitely get what you pay for here. Also if you do please have your own personal insurance because their insurance will not respond and the management will also not return calls. A nightmare I wish we could wake up from.</Review>

I must say this is the best storage facility in the area the faculty that works here is amazing and attentive and helpful with anything that you need this facility is clean and organized I have Had a lot of storage facilities in the past but this one has met  all expectations and I would not go anywhere else special shout out to Chris ,Martin& Rob These guys are down to earth and are willing to help you with your storage needs! Ask for one of them and I promise you won’t be disappointed. I’d give them a 10star if I could.</review>

This was by far the easiest self storage experience I’ve had.  Their level of hospitality was next level. Food, coffee, a tour, and a rate that was so low I actually didn’t think they would stick to it. 10/10 will do again.< /review>

<Review>Highly recommended, best rates in town.
Customer service is the number one reason why I'm in this location.
The way service is provided, shows appreciation for business with you.

I don't know how I originally posted a 2 star review on this place. I literally have no idea how that happened. My daughter had to help me figure out how to change it. In no way did I have anything but an exceptional experience. JoAnn is amazing. She goes out of her way to help people, and I absolutely love her. This is the best place to go for storage, HANDS DOWN. Don't go anywhere else!!!!<//review>

The best customer service I've had in a long time . Martin and the manager was super nice very approachable and very caring ! They have been helpful In everything I needed and currently need . Due to my situation of having to leave my storage so quick without even moving was a concern of mine because i thought they would give me less customer service but instead made me feel at ease with my process thank you for being so professional and quick to answer all my questions and concerns . I will highly recommend going here and getting your belongings stored . I know where I'm going next time I need a place . I will be recommending this place to anyone I know ! Thank you guys for everything I seriously appreciate it!!</Text>

I would say love this place but theres no ac or light or plugs so prepare fpr that. Its clean and safe and the communication between tenants and management is on point . Ive been there several years (6 ish and the rent has only been raised twice .. im happy with the rent @ the size i have . I wont share just incase its exclusive however i will say i have a 10X10 for under 140 And its not like "135" and im saying under 140 . Trust me   they have unbelieveable deals in comparison . I have a specific timeframe to enter and exit   DO NOT GET LOCKED INSIDE [been there 😣].</review>

Never go there again, called and ask for rates the sale person told me"first 3 month $230" when I got there he made the contract and charged me $230 a month.  I have  Ask why he charged me $230 a month and over the phone he said 230 for 3 month? he did not denied what he says but says this is our rates . I already drove all the way here unload into storage and came to pickup documents. I will stay for 1 month and will never come again.....I'm sorry to use this word this is my first time and I hope last to say it But they are liers and has very bad business ethics.<//Review>

<Response>{'time': 1487792529786, 'text': 'Hi Tal,\n\nWe take every complaint seriously as we do pride ourselves on our outstanding customer service.  We were able to track down the recording of the phone call you made to the office before you rented.  After carefully reviewing the call we have found that the office staff did offer you the special you currently have.  They did not offer you 3 months for $230.  You were offered a discount of $255 per month for the next 6 months, which is a discount from the normal price of $317 per month.  Perhaps you misunderstood or misremember the phone call.  As we stated previously we take the time to investigate every complaint made.  If you have any additional questions you can call our corporate office at (310) 914-4022 and leave a message.  A supervisor will get back to you as soon as possible.  We do apologize for the misunderstanding.\n\nThank you, Management.'}</Response><Date>1486101374616< /Date><name>Tal Cohen<//name>< gmap_id>

Fantastic boba teas and wonderful ambiance. I walked in my first time and walked out a Ten Ren recruit. Will definitely be returning to this cozy little tea house.</Review>

It’s a family run boba store with super friendly service. Their bobas is always perfectly cooked, soft enough and chewy. My all time favorite drink is the almond milk tea with half sugar. Strawberry peach is another option for lactose intolerant people. Oh, and don’t  forget to ask for a stamp card because I’m sure you will come back again.</text>

<Review>Two in our party got their mocha coffees (hot - can order iced too if you like) while two others ordered milk tea bobas. All of us liked our drinks because they weren't over-sweetened - the mochas had a good balance of smooth, strong coffee with yummy chocolate while the tea in the milk teas had a nice fragrance. Would definitely come back again!< /Review>< Response>

Best Bobba in Fullerton. Service is excellent and everyone there from the employees to the owners are amazing friendly people. I highly recommend this place to all my friends. I love their boiled dumplings. My wife likes the fried ones.</review>

I was really starting to like this place except that one of the cashiers was really rude to me. I've never had a problem with the 50¢ charge for purchases under $10 but this (Asian) cashier, after I gave my order, told me I HAD to make a $10 purchase. I was very confused because I had paid before with my card, no problem. I told her I didn't have any cash but still looked through my wallet knowing I didn't have any just to proved to her. I paused there still confused and very embarrassed and was about to cancel my order but then she proceeds to says I'll be charged 50¢ if the purchase is under $10. I don't know if she was having a bad day, didn't realize she was being rude, or they needed the cash in the register but I have NEVER had this problem with them before. Usually I'll pull out my card and the cashier let's me know I'll be charged an extra 50¢ and I'm like sure, it's ok. I completely understand that, but what I don't understand was the way this cashier talked to me. I'm very disappointed and will not be coming back. Sorry :(<//review>

<text>My Tea house radar tops this place as the best tea in town. Every drink on the menu is good. The tea-rista really know how to mix a drink!

UPDATE: 8/1/2019 - This place is now Mo's Tea. So far so good. So glad they kept the team of tea-rista! They make the best tea's</text>< Pics>

<review>I really like their Taiwanese dishes.  Not that healthy but very tasty.  The standout dishes to me are the stewed pork, fried dumplings and chicken wings.

My favorite drink is the green mango green tea, no boba and 1/4 sweet.  It has tasty green mango chunks and not too sweet.  They have all kinds of boba slush options etc.

Everyone is friendly that works there and it is very clean.< /review>< name>

Never disappoints, with a relaxed vibe from those working. Either a regular boba tea or the green apple slush with lychee and it's always great.</Text>

<review>I'm giving this place 4 stars, but keep in mind this review is biased. I really like boba, and this place serves a pretty wide selection of boba. Not only that, it also has food. Pretty good food at that. I guess the reason I'd give it 4 stars is that the employees don't seem to enthusiastic to see customers, but I'm cherry picking at this point.</review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dd29829fb32245:0x89e8b23bf4263341< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<rate>1<//rate><text>Tried to make an UberEATS delivery. Drinks were packaged poorly. Less than a block away, I had peaches and lychee all over my car interior. Cancelled the delivery. Lost money. Offline for an entire day to clean the upholstery. Lost money. Paying for upholstery cleaning that could have waited for another day. Lost money. Came back and talked to the manager. Her response? My fault. Wrong answer. It's bad business to tell an angry customer something is their fault. Now they have lost my business. I will also never deliver for them again. And everyone I know will be warned away from them.< /text>< pics>

< Review>
I'm so happy to have found Arcata Animal Hospital! Dr. Joy and her staff are the most knowledgeable, thorough, compassionate and professional you will find in Humboldt County. You and your pets are a top priority and it shows at the time of your appointment and the followup calls they make to see how your pet is doing. I will never go anyplace else! I recommend them if you are looking for a caring and professional animal hospital! The Best!<//Review>

<Review>This place will take great care of your animal, they have taken great care of my rabbit. It does cost a bit more than some other places but the quality of their services makes it worth every penny. While they do not allow individuals inside at this time, they do a good job of keeping you informed over the phone as to what is going on while your pet is inside the office.</Review><Rate>5</Rate><user>106059938992374498769< /user><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x54d15a03da9cca29:0xdd7fee708fc3210d<//Gmap_id><Pics>None< /Pics>< user_name>

Everyone we met during and after the initial visit was just so helpful and caring. I couldn't have planned better care for my pup during the visit. It's good to know that a quality team is standing by to help with whatever situation there is to confront. Thanks, again, for your care and support.<//review>< Pics>

<review>Doctor Joy is awesome!
She is very gentle and compassionate toward us and our kitty, Bogey.
Our girl tends to be anxious during visits, so Doctor Joy prescribed some meds for her so she would be more relaxed during her exam, and it helped.
The staff have always been so kind and considerate.
I highly recommend this facility!
Thank you, Arcata Animal Hospital!💕🐾< /review><username>Linda Cisneros< /username>< Gmap_id>

The Doctors and Staff at the Arcata Animal Hospital are the best at keeping our little guy "Finn" healthy and up to date with all of his vaccines.  They keep us informed with reminders and are very professional and careful with keeping everyone safe, as well as explaining any details with health care maintenance. A very loving and caring practice, just what we need for Sir Finnigan! Thank you!</Review>

<Text>My gorgeous pug recently passed away at the clinic. He was only 5 so it was absolutely devastating for us to say goodbye knowing we wouldn’t be bringing him home. The staff were very professional didn’t rush our last moments and made everything go flawless. The vet and staff were outstanding and I can honestly fault nothing. Thank you again for all the work you do and the long hours especially staying late so that Tito go a few extra precious minutes with us.< /Text>< Rating>

When our timid cat began to have a problem with one eye, we treated her at home for a bit with an ophthalmic vet approved ointment. It didn't get better. I called AAH and they managed to fit her in.( In the world of Covid it can be difficult to get an appointment without paying a huge emergency fee.)  Dr. Joy examined her and sent in a swap for culture/testing. Dr. Joy also called me at home two days later about 5:30 on a Saturday night to see how Patsy was responding. The most difficult thing we've experienced is giving Patsy eye drops 3x daily at home - but we are being successful with the help of a spot of canned cat food after every treatment! I want to thank the AAH for their compassionate and professional care provided our Patsy.< /Review>

Very clean coffee and magazine stocked waiting area. Relaxing. Dr Bartlett took time to explain everything in detail. She did not seem rushed although the animal hospital is very busy and well regarded locally. I highly recommend them. I am new to the area and I am so happy I have made an excellent vet connection.< /text>

Dr. Joy and her team at Arcata Animal Hospital saved our dog's life after she was attacked by another dog. I can't possibly express how grateful I am and how wonderful, compassionate, and professional everyone here was throughout.< /review>

Late night, during the pandemic, Arcata Animal Clinic was open and able to do emergency surgery on one of my dogs. An unpleasant event in already unpleasant times, I am so very thankful they were around to help my little homie out and he's on the mend for some better days ahead.< /review>

<text>I have two issues with this clinic. First, I called and asked if there was an avian specialist at this clinic and was told that there was. Although the vets at this clinic will see exotic pets, I do not believe any of them actually specialize in birds. This may have just been an error of the receptionist (who was otherwise amiable and professional). I brought my budgie in for a check up and received antibiotics for a respiratory issue, but when I asked about further tests that could be done if the antibiotics didn’t work, I was told that doing further tests would be very difficult on smaller bird species. The vet did not seem confident about being able to perform these tests. My budgie is missing half her cere and will likely have chronic health issues relating to this, so I really wanted an actual avian specialist to see her because they have more experience with birds and have dealt with special issues like this. If I had been told that there was not an avian specialist at this clinic I would have taken her to another county. The other clinics who i called in this area were honest about not having an avian specialist at the clinic even if they did see birds.

The second issue was when I got my budgie back. Her first primary feather on her right wing was twisted completely backwards, and her third, brand new primary feather which she just finished growing out on that wing was in the bottom of the cage (along with her older second primary feather). She is molting and only had one new feather on that wing - her other’s were clipped - so it was easy to identify.  I couldn’t go into the clinic while the vet was seeing her due to Covid-19 and was given the wrong dial-in number to watch the examination over the zoom conferencing app (which I downloaded just for this vet visit), so I don’t know how she was handled. I called to ask about this and they suggested that it happened after she left the clinic while she was with me in the car, rather than being accountable for a potential mistake on their part, and I received no apology for how she was returned to me. I was told I could bring her back to the vet, but her wing otherwise seemed okay and I didn’t want to stress her out further by bringing her back to a vet who may have handled her improperly.

So in conclusion, I am pretty disappointed overall by the lack of information about my budgie’s health in general, lack of options for follow-up care if the antibiotics don’t work (which an avian specialist should be able to handle), and lack of care with her handling. I’m sure this clinic is great with cats and dogs but I  would not suggest taking any birds to this clinic.

On my part, I should have done my research first, but now I am going to find a different vet to bring my budgie to for a follow up evaluation after this course of antibiotics. Currently, the closest registered avian vet is Niklos Webler at Whispering Pines Animal Clinic just east of Chico - found through the Association of Avian Veterinarians at aav.org. I hope this review will be helpful for other bird owners in the area who may be naive like I was.

Since it appears that Arcata Animal Hospital routinely responds to these reviews as well, I hope you will be more careful as a practice about telling people that you will see exotic pets (like birds), but not necessarily having a specialist in evaluating that species - unless I am somehow mistaken. The cost of taking a bird to see an avian specialist is about the same as your fee was (on average $70-$90) and I don’t think that is right either.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>I was so incredibly impressed with the Arcata Animal Hospital. They were able to see my dog just 40mins after I called them. They were so accommodating, professional and affordable. They went over all of the treatment options and prices and did not pressure us at all. We absolutely loved our experience with them and would highly recommend them to anyone.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

They treat my dog like a king when he comes in, he loves everyone here. I have had great experiences with every person I have met there, and they genuinely care about my dogs health. While their office is inconvenient since I live in Eureka, I will never change vets and it's 100% worth the commute to take him there instead of anywhere in Eureka.</review>

I recently called to see if they would send a prescription for revolution flea meds to an online company so I could get a cheaper rate. They said I would need to bring the cats in for a check up even though they are not in need of one. I pleaded with them to help me out bc my cat is suffering and I can’t afford an office visit.

These folks are awesome. You can really tell they love animals; they are kind and enthusiastic toward every pet that comes through the door. The quality of care is the best I've seen any of the places I've taken my dog. All of the staff, not just the vets and assistants, are very knowledgeable about the different services, procedures, and products so you can figure out what's best for you and your pet. Even though she goes in for shots and nail trims, Ginger LOVES this vet. She gets excited as soon as we come in the parking lot - and if that's not a gold star of approval I don't know what is!</Review>

I am torn... I had to put my dog to sleep, so I called around and was quoted X amount with creamation service, I immediately made the appointment and made arrangements for my dad to pay... our appointment was prompt even tho it was a holiday and doctor joy and her staff were great and respectful HOWEVER.... when we were “ready” we waited over an hour and the WORST part was I was told the WRONG PRICE!!! It was $350.00 MORE!!! What?!?! I had no choice but to spend part of my tight budget on the services or take home my dead companion?? When I was quoted one price then told another was egregious especially cuz I was distraught and tried to make all the arrangements beforehand so I didn’t have this exact problem... really sucked... they blamed it on a new hire... lame...</Review>

They say your animal needs intensive care or an operation only to get money from you two times i took my dog there the first time all i needed to give her was calcium (tums) and wouldnt tel me untill i insisted three hundred was all i had. This last week they said she needed surgery for obstructive bowel while the whole time was going poop she was intoxified by gasoline. I paid another 300.00 but they were wanting 1.500.00 they dont know what the hell their talking about but their real good about talking about putting your dog to sleep if i would have played in to their game my dog would be dead right now because of their inprofesionalism.<//Review>

Tammy and Nikki does an amazing job. Especially bringing these crusty toes back to life. Fast as well. Tammy isn't much of a talker but Nikki is if you like to be social</Text>

If you've gotten your nails done post COVID, you'll notice the sharp price increase in all services, at all salons. I got a full set with short white tips and clear gel and it cost $50. It used to be $35. Wish that the prices were posted. But overall, a good salon and I will return.</review>< Pictures>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>One of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had. Do not waste your time here, especially if you want a dip manicure. I was initially told 15 minutes to wait for my manicure. After 15 mins I was then told 30. After that time I was told another 30. I was offered no resolution to this problem at all. It was an absolutely appalling experience and would not wish it on anyone.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>I went to this place and got my nails done and my eyebrows done and my individual eyelashes. I like my eyebrows my eyelashes irritated me beforei I left she said that it would go away. The eyelashes continue to cut my eye my eyes were red and irritated and watering. I called and informed the lady on the phone that my eyes are really irritated and that I was going to come in to get them taken off. When I got to the nail shop they took off the eyelashes which was very painful and I informed the lady that it was really hurting really bad and she said it's okay. After I was finished she gave me a bill for $10. I told the nail tech that I didn't think I should have to pay because my eyelashes were done wrong. The nail tech laugh at me so I then walked away to Kelly which is the lady at the door who takes the money. I told her that I should not have to pay for a service that they did wrong. So then she tried to find excuses why I should have to pay she started with when did I get them done. I guess she was going to say I waited too long. But when I told her it was just two days ago she then went and said that I should have told her who did my eyelashes so that they could have took him off. She said that's the policy. She said because another person took them off I have to pay. Then when I looked around I didn't see the lady that did my eyelashes. Kelly then tells me to just give her $5. So that tells me that she know she was in the wrong but they wanted to get some type of money out of me. My eyes were bloodshot red no one never once apologized.</review>< pictures>

<Review>My experience here today was awesome!!! 🥰🥰🥰 This is my regular nail salon; but because of work and covid I haven't been able to go in awhile.  Today was my first time in a long time and I was very impressed with their outdoor setup.  I was able to get a pedicure, manicure and my eyebrows done as well.  All while enjoying good company.  🤩🤩🤩<//Review>< user_name>

<text>I've gone to Nancy for my eyebrows for a couple of years, she is fantastic! Recently had my gel manicure done by T and I was pleasantly surprised.

<text>They charge a lot! I didn't mind paying as long as my Nails were done right. I will not go back due to my Nails lift after being done.

Seems charging such a extreme high price your nails shouldn't never lift. Just Aweful and painful! I will not recommend this place.

If you must go, ask for the best to do your nails so you don't go through nails lifting.

However I paid a lot to get my nails done. They did not last.

I had to go back because two of my expensive nails popped off.

Got those fixed and three more just lifted right off.

So I have to go around with my hands with missing nails due to I don't have time to keep going back getting them fixed.

Most Frustrating. It's what you call tricks of the trade to keep you coming back which is unfair. One knows just what they are doing when they half do your nails.

So be sure to tell whoever does your nails to make sure they don't lift on you.

They are extremely too high for mess like that.

In the long run I went to another Nail Salon and it was suggested by the New Nail Salon I went to...to take the nails off and put new nails on.

To my shocking surprise I had fungus under my one of my Nails! Omg! 😲

I was charged 30.00 for a gel polish change tht they did NOT tell me was all they were offering & they charged the client next to me 15.00 since she got a full set. I love how they do lashes here but them upping the prices like tht w/out warning is VERY wrong & I won’t be going back for my nails<//Review>

<Review>The set-up is great due to the current conditions. I got a fill on a short set $40. I don't know what they were charging before covid.

Just because they are one of a few place open means they get to charge you so much! And in top of that rude.. all i asked the lady who was doing my nails was if she could even out my nail since it was un even.. she flipped saying she will do it later not then.. and shook her head mad.. like what the hell im paying for your service lady its me the one who’s going to be wearing those uneven nails.. so what is the problem?< /Text>

The method they used to remove my dip powder ruined my nails.  The didn't soak it off but used a nail tip and popped it off this removing a layer of my finger nail and ripping the length of my nail.< /text>

I came last week and my nails popped off two days later I was missing 4 nails after I paid $50 for a short set gel polish. The lady who did my nails rushed through it. They are over priced for the service and work they do I ended up paying $60 just to get my feet done and even the work for that wasn’t $60 worth. I will not be coming back<//review>

Service begins the moment you walk in.  Quick with ample staffing, which is great yet has its disadvantages. Rushed services and mediocre results. Its a great place for a last minute or emergent need, but lacks long term quality. The picture below was taken 2 hours after leaving the salon
2 weeks later i tried them again, insisting on quality and they delivered< /review>

<review>One day later & this is the results.😐 I went in around 5:15, I should've known when I opened up almost every color I like & it was dry as the desert. Finally I settled on this color because it was like new. There were 2 people inside 1 getting her nails done & 1 getting a pedicure by 2 separate people so the 3rd lady comes over to do my manicure... I Swear to you it took her almost an hr to do a simple Manicure that came out like you see in the pic..the next lady comes over around 6:05 to do my pedicure & by 6:20 she was done & they were rushing me out ...I asked what time they close,  she said 7 or 730 but it's Halloween we pass out candy..so you care more about passing out candy than having a returning customer? She messed up my big toe & started speaking in her language when I said I wasn't leaving until she fixed it(she was mad at me for her mistake) tried to fix it by polishing over it but I'm not one of them that will except that. Also this place looks as if hasn't had a deep cleaning since they opened which is another reason I should of just left & then some man that came to pick them up grabbed the file she was using on me & started using it on himself & then put it back for her to use it on me...I made sure she didn't touch me with that file...this place needs a visit from the health department...enter at your own risk....disgusting...that 1 star is for the nice lady who took an hr to do my manicure...her attitude was sweet..the others not so much..smh< /review><Rate>1</Rate>< response>

They are terrible! Wish I could give them negative 5 stars!  I have been getting my nails done for over 25 years and my nails are infected with fungus from going to them. I’ve been going there for years. The other day I went back and have asked for over coupe of months why my nails looked dark on a few spots on my nail under my acrylic. He lied and said it’s nothing. I got my nails filled and got gel polish. Twice in a couple of months it literally peeled off. I work in corporate America in a professional environment and need to be well groomed. I went back on my day off and was told I had to pay to fix the polish. Really!!! I paid $80 dollars and you’re charging me again for your terrible gel polish. Then the tech takes the polish off and I asked this guy who I never had do my nails why they are discolored. He said, that’s fungus. I went to the counter to tell the lm and they said I have to pay them to remove the nail!! What!? Then he blamed me and said you probably had water under your nails. What!! I wash my hands and take a shower daily so if there is then when I get my nails done make sure it’s dry. Since when does that cause fungus? They don’t sterilize their equipment! I’m reporting this to the state board and seeking legal counsel. Oh yeah, they put a dab of anti fungal serum on and said I need to go buy my own! No, you’re suppose to provide that for me! Your dirty utensils did this!<//review>

<Review>Remodeled and back open with new safety protocols in place. It is best to make an appointment right now because walk-ins aren't as easily taken at the moment. They do a temperature check and sanitize at the door before entry.</Review><Date>1593376010379</Date>< gmap_id>

<Text>Today I tried a new nail salon. My nail tech was Ben and my Pedicureist Diamond were outstanding. I was a walk-in. Went right to Ben. Then to Diamond who gave my legs the best massage ever. I wanted to take her home with me. Reasonable prices.< /Text>< pics>

The pedicure is so relaxing however they have package deals that’s they don’t fully follow. Sometimes I do feel like they can rush to much and give you half service,with each package you get a set amount of time they are suppose to massage your legs but they do not follow it. Any type of hand nail service will definitely take longer then getting your feet done.<//text>< pics>

<user_name>Candice Battle</user_name><text>I'm 19 and I've been coming here for about 3 years to get wax. Jackie is the only person I let wax me, and she has never failed. Katie is pretty good too. but for waxing, ask for Jackie because she's the bomb. the prices are excellent compared to nail and waxing places in the mall. as of getting the nails done, my experience has been good. nothing too bad. just make sure you tell them exactly what you want then ask how much it is even though you already know the price just to make sure they're on the same page as you. the people that work there are constantly smelling those chemicals 5+ days a week just to please the customers. if they mess up on something, tell them and they should fix it. as long as you're not yelling at them and being ghetto and loud, you should have a good experience.</text>< Pictures>

I could not even make it out of the store before two different nails smudged. One was fixed. At the time of the 2nd I asked for a refund was denied and told I should’ve done gel. The tech had suggested the regular.  Any place with more than 10 chairs is just after volume, not quality.<//review>< user_id>

My last two visits with Lily were garbage! I tried her again a few days ago after not coming for some months when she screwed up the last job… So I went in before an event I had to go to, expecting it to be in and out like always… Instead I spent two hours and got a cheap version of the picture I was shown… And she still charged me the price we agreed on for the nails with the design,even though she rushed thru my nails to get to the next client… And completely left off the design… there's no way I should've paid as much as I did for my nails… But again I had been there for two hours… She made me late to my event… And I didn't have time for the BS so I paid and left… And I hope it was worth it because not only will I never spend any money there again... I'm going to make sure my friends and family stop going there as well... *the pic on the left is not the exact design... but it's a lot closer than the BS on the right that I got... smh<//Text>

This is the worst experience ever as I sit here in tears not able to leave before I share how horrible this morning was. It's the day before my bday and I wanted to get waxed and get my day started I walk into this place happy and ready for a beautiful Sunday morning but satan came in with a force. I asked for a wax privately as I have always done. The lady they paired me with I have never used her before she already was have a shouting match with the front desk guy about why she had to do me privately. As I feel this energy I'm upset at the fact that I'm even having to deal with such unprofessionalism. As she walks toward the room she yells at me"you will pay me 30 dollars for this room" as I gain my composure on this wonderful I tell her nicely you wont speak to me like that or in that tone. I turn around her colleague is laughing so I proceed to the front explain that I'm not comfortable with her representation and definitely not performing my services. When I say embarrassed and disrespected was an understatement. I will never come back here or recommend this raggedy place ever......</review>

<Review>I was recently visiting the LA area and was looking to get a pedicure when I found this place. I was seated right away but I felt very rushed kind of like I didn't matter right at the that moment. They went way too fast and I was done in about 10 min. In other nail salons I have been to before I have had a much longer time. By the time they were done I felt like the job was incomplete. I don't think I would come back here again but if you like to pay a lot of money to get the largest package so that they will actually take the time to pay attention to you then I would highly reccomened.</Review>< name>

They rush doing your feet and nail. I went to a couple of them and same result. Eyebrows are the only thing I go to this place for.</Text>

I’ve lived in LA for over 3 years now and had been coming to Lisa’s every time. In fact, I would go out of my way but honestly, it’s a hit or miss with these guys. You never know who’ll you’ll get because the place is like nail salon warehouse. A few times I had a man name angel, he purposely put the nails on the very tip, a day or two after, you’re missing 1/2 of your nails on 1 hand. Is this to make me come back for fills? Weird. So sometimes it’s not worth the $80.

The eyelashes are a whole other department, there is this half black and half Korean eyelash technician  she is the bomb. Just be careful because the glue that they use is heavy duty and after my lashes would come off I would have to do major eyelash rehab. In other words, my eyelashes were gone.
The eye brow waxing omge yess, I was feeling like Beyoncé when I left. Just go somewhere else for the nails if you don’t like to take chances.< /Review>

This place should be called The Nail Factory. As you walk in the nail technician is called via speaker (in Vietnamese) Then 4 or 5 ladies guided me to my chair.

I asked for a gel mani & pedi. So the first techinitian (many lady ) greeted me and just asked me a few questions regarding the services I was looking for. The second lady (pedi lady) got straight to work pulling my legs here pulling my toes Here! OMG she was so rough!!! And the worst part she just cut my nails short without asking me .
Aside from all this there was about another 7 employees some working some weren't but they were all on their phones such as on YouTube ( music playing nice and loud for everyone to hear) or having phonecalls.

This has been by far the most stressful mani and pedi .< /Text>

I got lashes here for a special occasion a couple of weeks ago. The lashes looked very natural and actually held up well. This morning I went to get them removed and to say I was mortified when looking in the mirror afterwards would be an understatement.

I asked the lady would removal hurt and she said "maybe just a little". Well it hurt A LOT. It was only after that I realized the pain I was feeling was her literally pulling off the fake eyelashes and taking mine with them!! She was at first gentle but once she experienced difficulty removing them, she got impatient and just started yanking them out!!

NEVER AGAIN.

These women don't care about preserving your natural lashes AT ALL. They are more concerned with getting you out of their chair and the next person in. I had full lashes before and now there are visible bald areas. I'm sick!!!< /Text>

Good for the most part, but I'm giving it 3 stars because my last visit wasn't a pleasant one. The nail tech was getting impatient, and he was grumbling in his language because I was taking my time to look for a color. From the moment I sat down, he was asking me which color I want, even before he was ready to apply the color. I don't ever like to feel disrespected especially if I didn't disrespect you first. The manager was very helpful and apologetic, but even now I'm still upset. Before this experience I would have given it 5 stars.  Annie and Ms. Ivy are the best for pedicures.<//text>

Is ok their service sucks, but their work is not bad I've had good and bad experiences 1 eyebrow lady sucks i always have to do detail at home because she just waxes what she sees and leaves all the baby hairs there, most of the time if they mess up on the the nail art and you ask them to re do it they get mad. Last time i got the gel in a day it came off on my index. I guess you have to pick and choose the real good artist for you to really get your moneys worth.</Review>

<text>Terrible customer service. They guy that did my nails was awfully rude. He snatched my hand. He didn't want to show me polish colors. He told me if I didn't take off the nails I had which I intended to only fill he wouldn't do them. He also told me if I wanted metallic chrome nails he wouldn't do it unless I got them long. He argued with me about the proper name of "Mood Polish". Just really awful service. I'm never ever returning!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Visiting here from Florida, I was surprised to see the space they work in very big and the wait time was great. My cousin was done less than 30 mins</review>

<user_name>Laura Dowd< /user_name><time>1526347400262</time><Rate>1< /Rate><Text>I had a bad experience at Lisa's Beauty Salon I went for eyelashes and my eyelashes was glued on my eyes with weave glue my eyes swole up and I had to return the next day to get them removed and there was a second pair of eyelashes replace but those lashes still had my eyes swollen.
I spent $72 to get my nails done and have a pedicure then I paid $27.25 to get my eyelashes and eyebrows done I paid a total of $109.25 and I was totally dissatisfied and I will never return back to Lisa's Beauty Salon.
I even had the nerves to tip the guy that put my nails on my fingers.
I was also hurting for 2 days the liquid nail that place on the false nails had my fingers hurting  it was all on my cuticles all in the inside of the nails yes that was a horrible experience.
As for as I'm concerned they don't even deserve the one star that's my opinion and my experience there.
To me they look like they waiting to make a person at victim take they money and send them home dis satisfied.< /Text>< Pictures>

Bad experience at this nail salon,  I walked in asked the from desk how much for manicure and pedicure she said $26.00 for regular I said ok, I went to the lady that was going to do the pedicure for me and she pulls a card with prices on and starts adding a bunch of things I said no, just regular, she starts to speak in her language with her partner and she starts working on my feet with attitude, them she asked me if I wanted my feet scrub and I said yes, she said is an extra dollar for that.
I was surprised that they want to take your money in any way possible.
Not a good place to go to do your nails.< /Review>

When you tell them what you want at they front desk they give you a price but once you sit down and start your nails they start adding charges out of nowhere. The prices aren't posted so you know they can charge you anything. I wanted a full set which is $16 plus coffin shaped which was an extra $9. I wanted a basic pedicure and she told me $16. I sit down and the man start my nails and said $33. How? He said the length. Coffin has to be long because of the shape so to add more money on top of that is ridiculous. Then the lady doing my feet told me an extra $5 because I had gel on my feet. I heard three other ladies arguing with their nail techs about prices too. They think you stupid and don't know what you're talking about. Don't waste your money here. The lady hurt me several times while doing my feet and full set is the worst I've ever had. Will not be returning.</review><name>Tarryn Lanee<//name>< date>

< Review>
I am giving this place a one star. I went to go do my eyelashes and I told the lady I want a natural look since I have very small lashes and she said okay. I was noticing she wasnt putting one by one, she would grab them by three she kept on adding more and more. After she was done she let me look at them she had them all stacked on each other. It didn't look natural at all she even added glue on top all missed place I had so much glue on my eye lids. It was just horrible. At the end I waited for a friend and I decided to take them off they so felt uncomfortable. What got me mad was that I even had to pay to take them off. The lady didn't do her job right I asked for something simple and she did the opposite it was just horrible!!</Review>

Decided to have a relaxing pedicure day with my Bestie, we got the luxury package which includes a scrub, 5 minute massage, and wax
My pedicure was alright, she could have done a little more considering the 25 dollar bill but I was making the best of it. My friend was done first, she got very unlucky and got a girl that rushed through her pedicure in 15 minutes or less! Before the polish could dry she rushed her out the chair asking her to go pay and wait up there😲 I was left alone for the 15 minute remainder until my pedicure was finished. Like my friend I was rushed out my chair as soon as the last stroke was applied to my big toe smh!! 30 bucks  (with tip) to be told to get up is horrible customer service, it takes away from the relaxing experience. If you are coming for a quick pedicure, a design, or gel color options come here, if you've had a long week and you want to get pampered DON'T!!!! They have no intentions on making the experience a relaxing one. You are a ticket, A number, And A Profit end of story.< /Review>

One of the WORST nailshops in Inglewood. The customer service sucks.  The shop is big and farely new but is overly crowded with nail techs sitting around doing nothing. With the well stocked nail techs on deck....  There are very few that actually does well and know what there doing.  Prices are overly high for such amateur service AND I WILL NOT BE VISITING THIS SHOP AGAIN in the future.</Review>

I had the worst experience with attitudes here especially paying MY MONEY! They work is OK but getting my nails done is relaxation to me...Not to be arguing with nobody especially somebody that wants to get paid by me for my nails...I'll take my money elsewhere to who it's worth giving it to!<//Text>

I came here the nail tech did my nails to thin & they started to break & I called to see if they can fix them & the guy says they can’t because I didn’t know the man name or what he look like & but I don’t come here all the time so I’m not asking for names! Poor job & refuse to fix because I didn’t know the guy name< /review>

$15 for a basic pedicure....
BUT it did include the spa chairs which was fabulous. I felt so pampered as the chair massaged my aching back. Great with no extra charge!

(If you are getting a media/pedi combo they do not automatically turn on the chair massager so make sure you get them separate worth the extra wait time)

Only negative:
1. HELLA crowded. This place is like a sweatshop of nail care. SOO many stations, always busy, always crowded. Not a long wait time but you will be there with loads of people (great for people watching).

Overall $15 is fair for a basic pedi with spa treatment. If you wanna get the extras like the callous remover and foot massage that would run you extra.

They also do eyebrows pretty well so if your looking for diverse service this place is A-OK!< /text>

<review>THE WORST!
My nails look awful.  They are rude and talk behind your back because they would come to me saying something I had asked someone else.  They laughed at my face then smiled.  NO idea what they were saying about me, but I was not being paranoid.  One guy forced me to move my injured arm and I asked if he could move to the other side.  He had a temper tantrum and walked out! Just the worst experience ever.  RUDE RUDE RUDE! Just a mill of people walking in and out the door so they could care less about your comfort or experience.  To top it off, take a look around.  SUPER DIRTY! Probably catch some sort of staff infection or something there.  NEVER EVER GOING BACK AGAIN!< /review>< pictures>
