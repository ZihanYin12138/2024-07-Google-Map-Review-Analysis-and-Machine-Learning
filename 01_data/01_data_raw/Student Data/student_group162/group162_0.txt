<rate>5< /rate><Review>Great store. Not sure about all the negative reviews - I see many one-star reviews about the pharmacy here, which I don’t use for prescriptions. So I have no comment on that. My review is for the rest of the store.
This place is clean and well stocked, with an ample selection of beauty aids, health products, and over the counter medications. Cashiers at the front of the store are friendly and helpful. Parking is very convenient, as they pretty much have their own parking lot with no other businesses (except a small drive-through dairy and donut store, which don’t use their parking lot).  With vehicle entrances on three sides, it’s easy to get in and out,  there are always parking spaces, and there are no bug crowds of people, even at peak times. This is our go to otc drug store in the pandemic, seems like lower human density than CVS or Rite Aid nearby.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dcdbc6d71bcb0f:0x69a08b474fec99ec</GmapID></record>

I'll keep coming back just because of the wonderful experience I always have. Also, OLIVIA, MARGIE AND SAM have exceptional customer service skills and work with quick speed at the pharmacy.  I found the following photo of the Walgreens  in my bag with my prescriptions after leaving the pharmacy OLIVIA decided to put it in my bag because I liked it so much!!

My total was less than a dollar. But David ( who I guess is the store manager) made my day . The customer service and attention I received was impeccable. Very professional , knowledgeable and had attention to detail.< /text><Name>jignesh patel<//Name><Rate>5<//Rate>< date>

This is the kind of service that we hardly see, and this man should be running the company. Looked for disinfectants and sprayers, and he knew about everything, even testing a sprayer for me!

< Review>
Convenient drug store with limited groceries. Totally love that I can do drive thru though I haven't tried since reduction in hours. I usually avoid the peak evening times and there is usually less than 2 cars in front.  Sometimes you need to push the button several times. Waiting inside can mean lots of standing in line.  Recently the store stopped operating 24/7 so with shorter hours (currently 9 AM to 9 PM), it's less convenient.  There are the occasional panhandlers at the front entrance. They've added Electrical charging parking which reduces close in parking spots.<//Review>

Believe the review, I made a mistake and didn't believe what people said about this place.  They don't want to bill insurance and want you to pay out of pocket,  saying they can't process this insurance. My insurance did a 3 way call, provide all info,  they still refused,  and said pay out of pocket or go somewhere else. Disappointed... don't waste your time.  People here hate their job.<//Review>

I rarely like to go here for a few reasons. First, there are pretty much always homeless people hanging around. It's uncomfortable for a mother alone with her baby in a stroller.

It is the only pharmacy within walking distance and the closet pharmacy by a good amount. I went in one time to buy some detergent and the prices were so outlandish I went all the way home and drove to target! Also, the pharmacy is not only super popular but very inefficient.

This may be with any pharmacy but our experience was pretty lousy. My doctor called in a med and when I went to go pick it up they said it would be processing for maybe the entire day! They told me they would call me when it was ready but they never called! I finally had to call myself late in the day and they said to just come at the end of the day (5 pm) and it should be ready. So I waited in a super long line and finally made it to the counter to pick up my med.

The woman at the register was not a pharmacist. She was actually pretty slow and seemed like she had no idea what she was doing. She asked for my insurance card and I told her no I only have kaiser and the card won't help. She argued with me and told me to give her the card so she could check. I thought it would take a minute but it took forever! And in the end, of course, it didn't work.

I dream having to come back here to pick up more Rx's but I'm mentally prepared for it to be awful.<//text>

They tend to take forever on the phone (put me on hold for a while, even my doctor was on hold for longer than they should have to be) and in person (forget to fill a prescription until nagged about it or spend far longer than predicted filling it). Looks like others have experienced similar.< /text>

My fiancé and I decided to use Walgreens for our wedding invitations since we reside in Park Slope and our experience with them has been nothing short of spectacular. Melinda and her staff are very attentive and extremely knowledgeable. She and her team gave us exactly what we wanted, understood our taste and never tried to push us over budget. When you walk in to the store, someone is there to help you right away and you always feel like you are being taken care of. Their product line is extensive, their rates are very reasonable and their turn around time is really fast. All in all a top-notch place to go!<//Text>

Often there it's only one person to help and they're doing both leave inside and drive up. Ridiculous! There's really no place to sit they don't have any kind of a system where you can pick a number and go sit down you're supposed to stand in a line well hello I can't stand in line unbelievably annoying<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Called to order prescription for a client, spoke with the pharmacist.  Very condescending and rude.  Actually made the statement  "I don't care about the patient, just give me the address!"  I understand that service workers and doctors don't always feel for their clients, but at least show some respect and professionalism to them.  Would never recommend this pharmacy to anyone.<//Text>

Went to refill my Rx , the assistant-pharmacist was rude and uninformed of insurance 's protocol! Worst, I was told that I would have to pay the full price for my medication ( 360$) or get a new prescription to pay a lower price. But it was covered by my insurance! The same day, I rushed to my doctor to get an new prescription, called the insurance to clear the matter. Back to Walgreens the same assistant-pharmacist was still saying that I needed to pay the full price. My insurance had to talk directly to the pharmacist and I paid 70$. It took 3 hours to get my medication. Worst, it was done under the name of the wrong doctor and they lost my family medicine prescription.< /review>

If you want a candy bar, this is the place to stop (although you'll probably wait in line for that too).  Your doctor has the ability to send prescription straight to doctor, but the pharmacy WILL NOT fill it until you come in, then they tell you to come back in a few hours.  Every time you go, there is a minimum 30 minute wait. The drive through the is the worst because once you're in line you can't get out-bring a Snikers Bar!  Today was the last straw when I called and was on hold for 45 minutes.  No Joke!  Go somewhere else!  This is the worst pharmacy known to man!!!<//text>

When I arrive to the pharmacy I'm told other wise.. You're to early for a refill or ur insurance doesn't cover which I knw its not true ... They made me paid 70 bucks once the first time when my insurance covered</text>< Pics>

This is the worse Walgreens pharmacy on the planet. Very poorly managed! Staff are impatient! I called a week in advance to refill my daughter's formula so they can order it. I was told that it would be ready by the following Monday and be sure to call before showing up. I called Monday as instructed, and I was told no formula was orderd!!! My daughter formula is running out of milk in 2 days and the rep told me it would take 7-10 business days to arrive!!!!! Insane!!!
I was told that they will call me back with 30 min - 1 hour. That didn't happen. I called back again and was told I can pick up 2 of 7 cans remain after 6pm on Monday and the rest can be picked up on Wednesday. Again be sure to call before showing up. I have been on the phone 3 times, each time more than 25 mins wait and when it comes to my turn, the rep hung up on me!!! On my 4th call, I was told someone will call me back in 30 mins max as the formula is not ready!!! Don't use this Walgreens if you don't have to!!! Stay away!</Text>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>One of l WORST pharmacies in the Walgreen Universe!   I finally lost patience with this too busy pharmacy and switched to a local pharmacy and CVS.   If you call in at the wrong time, you can wait on hold for upwards of 1/2 hr+ only to get disconnected purposely (they get too busy to answer) when you're next in the que.   This has happened more than once, and I've endured this method of theirs many times because I needed to get a prescription refilled that required the Dr's office to fax them.   This Walgreens won't call, text or email you if there is a problem.  You have to call them to wonder what's going on.   I am so relieved to find personal service again with Tustin Pharmacy or even CVS at Orchard Hills.   What took me so long to change---I'm a creature of habit and very patience.<//Review><rating>2< /rating>< Gmap_id>

<text>I've never in my life felt compelled to write a review for anything but I need to comment on how poorly run this pharmacy is.

Long story short, this pharmacy doesn't have a good way for a doctor to call in a prescription because they never answer the phone so the doc is left with leaving a voicemail- which the pharmacist doesn't listen to for hours or, in my case, claims there "are no voicemails" (despite the fact I heard my doctor leave them a voicemail). My guess is their voicemail is broken and they are too dumb to realize that it is highly unlikely there "are no voicemails" given they never answer the phone and the phone is constantly ringing. Today, my doctor said to me "In my 30 years of practice, I've never dealt with a more incompetent pharmacy. You need to switch." That tells you something...

At the end of this, I'm left without the medication I need tonight. I'm lucky my issue isn't life threatening and I hope this doesn't happen to someone worse off than me.<//text>< pictures>

No matter what time of day, I wait at least 20 minutes in line at the pharmacy.  Even if I've filled my prescription online, I always have to wait a very long time. It's frustrating every time. I wish there were more 24 hour Walgreens by me.< /text>

< Review>
Last year I was offered a job by a man claiming to be the owner. I have not returned since nor can I keep silent. I was hired for two days with the promise of paid training. The owner did not keep his word and fired me via text after two training sessions. His reasoning being that he needed "more than a pretty face". After learning his true intentions it made sense why he wore such strong cologne to my first shift and stood so closely to me during the "tour" of the shop. By the second shift he expected me to have most of the menu memorized as well as know how to prepare most menu items. The menu is very large and made up of varrying ingredients stored in freezers. Nothing on the menu is prepared without thawing first.< /Review>

Laptop work, casual meet-ups, and small meetings are very doable. I tried their Dark Chocolate Chip Ice-Blended. It's fairly good, not too sweet (as dark chocolate should be), and bits of crushed coffee beans are noticeable. I strongly recommend this for all coffee lovers!< /Text>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>ARROGANT OWNER but food is good.

I saw this place had high reviews on google so I decided to give another local business a try.  I walked in attempting to order two sandwiches and a smoothy when the owner walked away mid order to deliver someone their food.  When he returned he completely ignored me until I asked "did you get my order?" The owner responded that he did and the chef is already working on it.

Food was made quick quickly to have be incomplete.  In fact, the owner did not get my full order and was not willing to listen the first time around.  After a few world exchange about the order being incomplete he asked the kitchen staff to complete my order.

Once all the food was made, I attempted to provide some feedback to the owner.  I was hoping to tell him that maybe next time confirm the order with the client to make sure you're both on the same page.  However the owner refused to exchange words with me besides the good old "F&%K YOU"

I walked out stating I will write this review to hopefully provide the feedback to the owner.

Sadly - the food was actually very good.  I wish the owner would take more pride in good customer service, as he clearly does about his food.

What a shame to give such a low score so a place with lots of potential.<//Text><user_id>114585796259819829163<//user_id>< rating>

Great local coffee shop just like one should be. Huge selection of tasty treats of every sorry imaginable. Starbucks pales in comparison. Java on ocean's hot chocolate was sensational. All the coffee are great. Good selection of beans. Nice ambiance with lots of little tables just right for one or two people to work on computers. And the singing birds in cages are a nice touch.</review>

<Review>The service I recieved was good, the young lady who helped me was polite and had a fun personality. I had a veggie falafel wrap that was grilled on a panini press, it was yummy.  I had a double coconut milk mocha that was not very good ( I almost asked to be remade, but didn't want to be a jerk). I'll give another try my next time in the neighborhood.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Food was pretty good, but the bird presence was questionable. The biggest bird had the smallest cage while the smallest birds has the biggest cage, which was a little odd.< /text>

Sunny interior and, if the weather was more favorable, sunny window views as well. This coffeehouse was a warm and encouraging place to work, with a solid wifi and a profusion of power outlets. In the morning (and they do open really early!), the place was quiet, but as the morning progressed, patrons streamed in, including both students and random visitors. Be aware that all these people can eventually become a bit noisy, if you intend to study for longer, bring your headphones.

They also have a decent food selection. I was recommended the savory croissant, with egg, tomato, and avocado, and it was delicious. The server was nerdy but cordial.< /Text>

Decent coffee and good. A very nice interior and tables. But... I have had less than desirable service every single time I've gone there. Not sure if its the owner or an employee but they just speak to me as if I am annoying them and wasting their time. Very short, snappy and condescending. It seems that other people have had a different experience, so may be it was bad luck on my part. I've been four times, but only because it's open the latest. But the last time they were so rude I haven't gone back.< /Review>

As for coffee shops this stands Tall above any Starbucks I've ever been in. Maybe it's the San Francisco way about them which give the white chocolate moca I'm sucking down right now it's extra flavor or the unintimidating Asian patrons sitting around me doing the same thing, either way it gets an easy four stars in my book.</Review>

<review>Not from the Bay but I've been here before several times whenever I visit which is often. The Guy that runs the cafe kinda has an attitude which I can deal with. However, he purposely over charged me and when I sat back at my seat I pulled out my phone and began scanning the menu and doing the calculations on my phone. He noticed this and immediately shouted from across the cafe "i made a mistake with you". Like c'mon bro why are you gonna try to hustle your customers?< /review>< Pics>

<rating>2<//rating><Review>Had two crazy bad food items here. One was a roast beef bagel sandwich, which came with melted cheddar on top and smothered in some sauce that reminded me of In-N-Out burger. It was so bad I couldn't finish. The other was a breakfast burrito, which they forgot about after me waiting about 30 min. The owner was apologetic which was nice, but what I got tasted so bad. It was 80% salsa--if there was egg, it was so minimal that I didn't even notice it, the other ingredients were like 15% avocado and 5% grated cheese. So weird. If you're going for coffee and to get work done, this place is fine, though it seems like they don't have AC so when I was there it was sweltering.</Review>< pics>

Java is probably the best place to get work done in this part of SF. Great coffee with great sandwichs and snacks mixed with awesome service is a success. If you're in the area and need a pick-me-up, I recommend java.</text>

This place has character. A bit beatnik / ripped-couched-with-foam-sticking-out character, but in general, it's more towards the charming than dirty.

I decided to try a soy mocha today.  'twas my first of this sort of beverage, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but it seemed fine.  Service was non-descript.  Prices seemed about average.

My semi-blind date?  Intelligent, cultured, and stunningly gorgeous.  So, yeah, I didn't really notice all that much about my surroundings.< /Review>< pictures>

The Decorations was good, the service was slow (I was the only one standing in line) and the food was poorly done. I ordered a bagel with ham & egg & cheese and the sandwich was full of eggshells.  Nothing can ruin your breakfast more than a mouth full of eggshells... last time I go there.< /review>

<text>I've spent more hours sitting and studying on the comfortable couches with piles of books stacked up on the large coffeetables in this place than I care to admit!

The coffee is OK, but it's not of the same caliber of, say, Sightglass, Blue Bottle or Ritual. But it's perfectly drinkable.

But it's not the coffee you come here for, specifically. It's to have a large, friendly airy room to study in, either alone or in groups, and Java on Ocean fits the bill perfectly.

They've also got an cute little pet songbird with a "Beatles moptop" (you just have to see it...) in a beautiful, large, antique cage who keeps the atmosphere cheery with his adorable little song.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<Review>Amazing breakfast Sandwich at Java, found this place through Google map and decided to check it out based on their rating. I found it to be a cozy place and Hazam and his helper were super nice and gave me an  extremely warm accomodation. Thanks Hazam For the recommendation, you read my mind as I was checking out your breakfast menu. The egg and Turkey sausage on a croissant with tomatoe and avocado was Yumm!!😊< /Review>< pictures>

<text>I loved this coffee shop, first there are plenty of seats  available, and the wifi is amazingly good for San Francisco. I also had a breakfast burrito, the egg salsa and cheese and it was hot and filling, I also bought a chai latte and it was soooo good, it tasted liked real chai not the instant overtly sugary kind. I more very vital thing, parking was easy to find in the residential area and super close to java. I will definitely be coming back here for food and to work :)</text></record></dataset><record>

这咖啡馆不错，不但是老字号咖啡馆。而且一向来都是保持整洁而又特式的布置。咖啡香味很特别。让顾客品尝上隐的感觉。很不错。棒棒哒👍</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I love OAN, they are the network that has true conservative values. They are not afraid to tell the truth about what is happening locally and around the world.  I will not watch Foxnews ever again. You can get OAN  at AT&T cable tv.< /Review>

<Text>I first saw OAN when I was in Eurasia.. They were saying things I knew weren't True and they were so Anti-American. I watch for hours as they would replay the samething over and over. I figured since I was so close to Ruassia it was a Russian propaganda network..
It seems so real, except I knew certain  things were wrong and not true. I still found it fascinating because they sound like they were American but it looked and felt funny. It is interesting after many years later they are now broadcasting here in America. This fake new. Listen and you will realize it is only them say what they are saying and that they will eventually say something you know just isn't true but they make it sound good.. Humm.... I wonder if I could get a job there.... It would be interesting and I bet they pay well too.<//Text>< Pictures>

Great News And Travel channel. Professional crew, Modern and automated HDTV news studio complete with anchor desk, talk shows, etc, a very nice right leaning addition to all the left leaning major news networks ...
Very market minded and ultra competitive, great way to sell your luxury goods like real estate and yachts on their second travel and luxury channel... just contact them about getting exposure for your brand... very nice to have such an all around world class new media package all here in San Diego</text>

You report the news the way it's supposed to be reported.  Even during the  Peter Jennings era when they tried to keep the news unbiased you top even them!  Your commercials are educational.  You cover more information in 15 minutes than most news media cover in an hour.  You are straight to the point without all the 'personal opinions'.

Please keep it honest and fair.  You are so worth watching.
Thanks, Kate<//Text>

I just found this channel on my TV yesterday.  I have been watching it ever since.  GREAT.  It compares itself to France2; BBC, France24, and El Jazeera  in reporting the news.  I like the international news and a more realistic reporting of the politics in America.  CONGRATULATIONS!!  (By the way I am in Northern Virginia -  Washington metro).</Review>

<review>My  wife and I  have been watching your news since almost day one
we like how you just give the story with no bias or political motivation.
I would like to say to other people giving these reviews there's a difference between the people reporting the news and commentary, the news reported on this station is just that news . It's very refreshing to see the good work OAN does.<//review>< rating>

My daughter worked for the SO-Called company and because of their lack of completing training she found that there are many issues. This company hired her and then in less than three months was doing three jobs without being trained on two of the jobs they handed her. She then went to Finance/HR and spoke to them about concerns. In the same day that she went to HR she was fired for what she discussed. There is no HR and the hiring process is very unprofessional. Firing someone for what doing the right thing is so very unprofessional. Not to mention some of their ethics are very unprofessional and not ethically right. Stay away from this company and be careful what you are buying . Ask a lot of questions and understand what you are getting into. I am HR and I know a persons Labor Rights.< /Review>

Graham Ledger please educate yourself on the physiological facts of transgender persons.  These people are BORN with the physiological aspects of the gender they identify with, not necessarily the aspects of their genitalia.  Get your head out of your a__, please.  I tend to agree with most of your political opinions, but couldn't disagree with you more on the topic of transgender.  And how many transgender people do you actually know, personally?< /text>

The best news, commentary and documentary shows around.  TRULY nice to see the segments regarding the US constitution and US history (NICE WORK).  May your teams broadcast audience continue to grow.  More people need to watch OANN for the truth.  The OANN team is collectively the best bar none.  If you ever need support, don't hesitate to contact me.

I hope that when  One American New advertises, they will advertise one "Made in American" business each day. That is the only advertisements I will view. They make me feel so good to see Americans working. Otherwise I will "fast forward" or  switch channels.< /Review>

<text>Finally a News Channel that gives you a bit of old history to keep you informed.  I love this station and the newscasters.  But I may add they should tone down their makeup a bit.<//text>< date>

<Text>The Graham Ledger show is THE BEST news show on cable news!  This station SHOULD be available through EVERY CABLE PROVIDER - Many of my friends (I belong to a republican women's group) are contacting their cable providers, like Cox, Direct-TV to demand that this station be available to them.  I encourage anyone reading this that can only view One America News thru the internet to call your provider and demand that your provider carry this station!  Graham Ledger is terrific!  love this show -<//Text>< Pics>

My company is trying it out at work this week, after years of having Fox News on.   Some in the office say they don't like One America News, during the first day of having it on.   What I have seen and heard seems fine thus far.</Review>

The news is truthful and like the lack of commercials. My only problem is a few of the young reporters repeat themselves but hopefully experience and time will cure this. A nice change from the network and other cable news on tv. The breaks which are snippets of American history are excellent mini-history lessons.< /Text>

This is by far THE BEST news network you'll ever find. Forget all the other "news" networks - they don't even come close. So if you're tired of CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, FoxNews and all the rest of them - subscribe and watch real, professional, interesting, intriguing, informative news. Their programs are killers one after the other. And most of all - you'll never yawn at the screen when they are on it. I guarantee you.<//Text>

Tipping Point tells it as it is.... Liz Wheeler it takes guts and you have demonstrated a wealth of knowledge telling it as it should in a world of compromise.

Keep up the good work.

I appreciate that the channel hires young journalists, however, please give them some training.  Too many of the off camera reporters sound like high schoolers reading "what I did on summer vacation' reports.  I like the channel but the immature sounding reporters and lack of presentation skills  has become genuinely irritating.<//Text>

They omit relevant facts and make false statements to slant towards a mostly "Right Leaning" Viewpoint.  I don't mind hearing a "Right Wing" Point of View but Lying about Well Known Facts to mislead people does not make for a Well Informed Opinion if you don't want to be manipulated.  I will continue to only use this Network as a Biased Point of View source.  Anyone that Advertises on it should also be viewed as Suspicious like Ads on Fox News like Gold is actually a Good Investment.</Text>

<text>I love how all the liberals label this network a conservative network.  It goes to show how biased the media is, that any news channel that doesn't lean left is conservative.

It doesn't matter that it doesn't lean right either, must lean left to not be conservative!!!

Good network, real news, no biased< /text><Time>1459365077646</Time></record></dataset><record>

I find Graham ledger's commentary excellent and so germane––so veritas.  I've heard Liz Wheeler also make excellent comments. Their general news reporting is also well done and informative. I'll continue to watch OAN every evening!

I really like OAN news as it is very fair and much less biased reporting the political news. All the others stations are very one sided, which i don't like.
OAN reports on more important world and domestic news. I like the fact it is family owned. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK. I will continue watching.< /Review>

Turn to FOX in the AM but few seconds later always switch to OAN where the news is ALWAYS presented in a clear, objective, and  succinct format, and NO commercials!!!!!  Congratulations OAN - you have the right formula for communicating news events and I am telling all my friends.</review>

First there were the Networks,after that Cable CNN etc. Then came FOX wich is becoming a mixed bag. Just recently we got OAN.This is the right way news should be . No bias, straight forward,what a welcome change.

Liz Wheeler & Graham Ledger are the best! They cut through any left wing nonsense with insight and call them out when the lefties try to change the subject.  As we all see, the Democratics l& Progessives can never answer a logical question. They have a habit of changing the subject because they have no answer.< /Review>

'OANN' - One America News Network is always realistic news, not fake news! We listen to much of it daily and their news casting helps us provide a relevant Facebook web page which we have nurtured daily for about 18 months. Our web page is titled "Californians For President Trump". Our weekly reader numbers are between 9,000 and 65,000 per week. Besides being pro-President Trump, we are also anti-Gov. Brown. ....OANN Also has very limited advertising which means they are not swayed by the money-pool! Thank you OANN for giving us a huge change from the Liberal Media!</text>

<review>I would like an administrator to contact me to discuss my visit today.  All but one of my Doctor's is Sutter North. I have been really happy with all my Doctor's staff and nurse's.  There is one l had a problem with and reported it.  I believe today was payback.  I also know he had violated some laws.  I was willing to overlook this but after today l am not. Please contact me as soon as possible.< /review>< pics>

Arrogant physician misdiagnosed my child because he couldn’t spend more than 1 minute in the room. If I hadn’t followed my gut and taken him to the Children’s hospital he could have a serious illness or death as a complication. I’d NEVER take a child here again.<//review>

They had Covid 19 testers waiting in the same line as regular urgent care patients. That’s absolutely crazy if they’re trying to prevent the virus from spreading. They should’ve formed a separate line at the very least. Other facilities even have COVID testers go into a different entrance. Often times people have to wait in the line for about 30 minutes so exposure to a likely positive candidate to someone who is already having health issues is a big problem.</Text>

Last month I had several occasions to use Sutter Urgent Care. Each time the reception staff were courteous and professional. This has to be a stressful job dealing with people who are in pain, or at the least unhappy they are there to start with.
I was there for a lacerated arm due to a fall. Nurse Shauna D. was the nurse assigned to me. She was very thorough and explained wound care to me. My foot was swollen and she suggested an x-ray. The x-ray determined  a toe was broken.

Dr. Tseng then saw me and showed me the x-ray and explained my options.He was very nice and very courteous.

The second time, I again saw nurse Shauna D. For an infection. She went above and beyond to make sure I had lab tests and was prescribed the proper antibiotics and to arrange an appointment with my Physician.

After this long posting, it is only necessary to summarize my experience  with Sutter Urgent Care And staff as excellent.< /Review>

<review>The receptionist wouldn't take a picture of my health care card so I went thought the whole hassle of getting a temp card even though I had all the information cause she said she had to scan it in then after a CV couple hours of figuring out and talking to the insurance company I got a temporary card and went back and the same lady was there and only need the info this time. Where is the compassion for the sick, I didn't go in there to hangout.<//review>< Pics>

Just went in to get blood work and the guy drawing blood was very rude. Acting like I was supposed to know what to do already, talking extremely quick, and then looking at me in silence like I'm stupid after I asked if he could repeat himself. You can take 10 seconds out of your day to explain, your not that important.<//Text>

< Review>
This place is really going down the drain. We are long time patients with Sutter North, but the way this place has been ran the last few years, we are seriously considering another health care group. We came in, it was supposed to be a 30 to 45 minute wait. We have been here two hours, the last hour and a half it has been a wait in a small stuffy and hot to waiting for a doctor. Not ONCE has anyone come to check on us or at least let us know we haven't been forgotten. Y'all need to get it together. The entire health group here in YC has rapidly and progressively taken a major turn for the worst.</Review>

Sure some times they are busy. Other times slow. They have always seated me and saw me in a reasonable timely manner and I've been there multiple times over the years for different things.  This urgent care has access to run lab results in less then 1hr.  People dont realize how important that is! They can run test to see if your having a heart attack, bacterial, viral infection, chemistry on you to give you accurate treatment for you situation.  Other urgent cares in town dont have access to lab results so fast(24-48hrs for their lab results).   Try going to Ride out and wait much much longer to get the same testing done.  Ride out will give you worse service, much longer wait times for similar services this particular urgent care can offer.  Sutter urgent care is good and I will continue to use them always if needed.< /review>

My Girlfriend was visiting me from Canada and she had purchased travel health insurance. When she got sick the insurance company said that this location will bill them directly through Aetna. When she handed the receptionist the insurance card the rudely and disrespectfully said "what is this?, this isn't health insurance, this is travel insurance". I replied that it is health insurance and you are listed has a provider. The receptionist kept interrupting me saying that this is not real. I showed her the phone number on the insurance card so she can confirm with them and she said "Its not our job to call insurance and see if you are covered".....The receptionist did not check on her computer or check with anyone to see if I could be helped...she wouldn't let me speak to explain the insurance....so we went to an MED CARE in roseville and we where taken care of.< /Text>

bad service and 3 hour wait. Also nothing was done just a blood sample and the assistant had poked the needle in without looking for the vein and then started looking for the vein for a good 2 min then she went looking for help. Another thing is also if a patient is in PAIN and the doctor told us he will provide some medication while we wait in PAIN and after a 2 hour wait he asked us how is the medication is helping you?  BUT we didn't get any medication. His face expression shows he was disappointed to hear that and why would someone want to do business with a company that lacks in service  and experience.  its been 3 days and we were told we would get a call and no call yet. I called 3 times and was told its still pending and day 4 still waiting<//Text>

<Text>The nurse Gus and desk clerk Sunny were wonderful, but our visit was a huge waste of time. After waiting over an hour and a half, the doctor finally came in only to tell us that they didn't offer pediatric services and that we needed to take our daughter to the ER. He didn't even look at her. A frustrating waste of time and money!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

The wait time is always reasonable, all of the staff is friendly and helpful, I have never had a bad doctor and in fact several times have been fortunate to have Dr. Jayanth Talluri who is an outstanding doctor. He is thorough, helpful and kind and I would recommend him to anyone! Excellent urgent care!< /Review>

<text>Took my son here for a fever that has came and gone over the past 6 days I saw a PA who I believe was either newly hired or new graduate and she only cared about the little pimple like sore.  Not his fever not his weight loss.  Then I go to Walgreens for a prescription and my insurance denies it because my child isn’t old enough for it.  Seriously he is 8 down to 50 lbs and you are giving him adult medicine!   The next day my dr called me to follow up and requested I bring him in to see him and I get told he has severe chest congestion and prescribed the medicine he needs for his bronchitis<//text>< rate>

<Review>It’s sad how quickly this urgent care has fallen into the gutter. SMF does not support its offices in Yuba-Sutter at all and with the poor management coming from the office manager at this location. Who was given the job without having any real qualifications, has made this place even more of a joke then it was in years past before her. She is the one old lady  that smells like vodka and dresses like a forever 21 reject wardrobe wanna be at 50+ (vagina hanging out of her dresses nearly). Who sits in her office scrolling through FB on her phone waiting for happy hour to start. You can always catch her belligerent at the bar (great representation for SMF) lol.</Review>< Date>

I was very sick and needed to be seen, when I didn't have the date of birth of my step father(who my insurance is under) some lady named "Samatha" at the front very rudely asked, "okay, so you don't want to be seen today?" after responding no she so rudely gave me back my id and insurance card without a word, but with plenty of attitude. Which was pathetic really because the date of birth was not even necessary, all that was required was  a phone call to the insurance to make sure i was under it, but i guess that was too much work.< /text>

Their "fast track" program, where you are supposed to be seen in 20 minutes if you have a particular ailment, is a total joke. Been one hour and a half now and I have one of the illnesses on that list.</text>

<review>I have had nothing but positive results from Sutter North.  I have never waited more then fifteen minutes before being seen.
The Doctors at Urgent care have taken care of things that Rideout dropped the ball and now,  including....  When I was bit in the back of my neck by a black widow.  A Rideout Doctor gave me an E. K. G then told me that I was having chest pains because(his words)" your to fat,  you need to stop eating so much and start exercising, you have been discharged " well I was not having chest pains, he never listened to a single word I had said,  he did not look at the treage notes,  he just took one look at me and decided that because I am overweight that I was haveing chest pains.
Sutter north took care of it the next day.
If you don't need an ambulance ride go to Sutter North,  your life may depend on it</review>< Pics>

Pissed!! Urgent Care doesn't perform IV's... Seriously?!? My wife was very sick and dehitrated over the weekend so she needed fluid, but apparenly they lack the competency.  When asked why they can't, they said it's because they don't have an RN on staff...  So a Doctor or Nurse Practitioner can't do an IV? Pathetic!!</review>

Went in at 9:15 and was told "we don't know what we can do for you we are about to close" (mind you they close at 10) after talking to a friend she said they told her the same thing recently! So I called and left a voicemail to the manager to complain and of course she never called me back! Go figure.<//text>

Only thing "urgent" about this place is the name. Uncaring experience from staff and doctor. Went to a different clinic down the street and got the help I needed.<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>A gem in the city of Redondo beach and the entire city of LA! I drive 40 miles to have their kabobs and if this is not something to convince you with the quality of the food, I’m not sure what would. Their kabobs literally melt down your throat so you won’t even need to bother chewing the meat. The service (even during the covid) is on point. The staff are the sweetest and they every single time make my trip all worth it. I have tried almost everything on their menu (their soups, their sides, different entree, etc.) and still can’t pick a favorite! Each item is amazing in its own way and you should try their saffron ice cream... I mean... are you still reading this or on your way to their restaurant?! :D<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

I told my friends about this restaurant with my warmest recommendations. I visit this place often. This recommendation is always successful. The dishes they serve are yummy and the team is generous and cooperative. Whenever we eat in this place we have a cheerful evening.  I warmly recommend this restaurant.< /text>

< Review>
I have been a patron there since they opened.  I went there to celebrate my parents 65 wedding anniversary. We had a party of 12. After waiting 20 minutes to get water a drink order in the server finally served water at the same time our drinks were ready. Then ignored for another 20 minutes while he sat at a table on his laptop. He finally came over to take our orders then it was over 45 minutes to get our cold food. My white fish came with a little bit of stainless steel scrubber pad garnish on it. Was given a 20 dollar gift certificate and but no apology . Asked for water to wash down the scrubber pad but it never came. Server never bust the table for dessert. He did add a $52 tip on the $250 tab for all his neglect . I always tip 25% even for mediocre service.  First time I didn't want to pay that. Never going back again.<//Review>

Food was excellent and service was great.  Menu is limited but fresh fish and other options beautifully plated.  Dog friendly as well with a lovely patio, two blocks from the ocean.</Text>

Our party ordered lentil soup and roasted cauliflower soup and both were excellent. We started with mixed appetizers - baba ghanoush, tabouli, humus, and the walnut and olives tapenade. All were very good but the tapenade was amazing. We had the white fish and the lamb. The fish was very good and the lamb was amazing.<//text>

Though we were given numerous apologies throughout the overall experience left us not very motivated to return. This was especially disappointing based on the previous reviews noting how great the service was. There was also no offer to comp anything given the extended delays throughout the experience.

Good luck diners!< /Text><Name>Karlene Hart</Name>< time>

We had our first date there..and have gone back many times over the last few years.  Love the spices on the chicken.  And the saffron ice cream is the best!.</review>

I wish I could find words that adequately express what a wonderful,wonderful wonderful restaurant Turquoise is. I have traveled the world and eaten at many restaurants but never in my life have I had such a good experience as I did at Turquoise.  The food is served in the most attractive and artistic manner. It is obviously fresh and the taste is beyond description. I have never had green tea like I have had here nor have I felt so comfortable. You can see how clean and organized the kitchen  is. The decor is nothing but class and the staff is very knowledgeable in the subject of organic food. The service was outstanding and let me say that you have not lived until you have eaten the Baklava.< /text>

Very slow service. Supposed to be healthy eating, but menu does NOT disclose that saffron & onion are in everything but the water. Did not disclose that citrus is in the water. For so many with food allergies these days, disclosure is a must.< /text>

As a food snob, I was really pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food at Turquoise. Really fresh and quality ingredients (grass fed, organic meats and Wild European Salmon) combined with creative, Mediterranean recipes made our dinner a very memorable one. I will definitely return here soon, it's on the short list of places to go in the South Bay.<//review>

<text>It was unfortunate that there was an event while I was there ...group of 24.  So very busy.  My server was very nice and the owner too especially after my tea press exploded.  The lamb was tender and full of flavour.  Lentil soup was very good.   I came here because of the reviews but when I had entered I had been shuffled to an awkward table while a couple ten minutes later was given the choice of tables including the one I had asked to sit at.  I felt like I was being put aside because I was alone. Not by choice... I am on business travel.  I am sure that was not the intent but I was also ignored until my tea exploded. Then the staff was very friendly.  I can't rate a restaurant that made me small.< /text>< username>

Had dinner there with my girlfriend a few months ago.  The food was fantastic the service was over the top. Our waiter graciously allowed my very poor French which was fun to try to remember. The over all experience was on a scale of 1 to 10 a 12!

It is my girlfriends birthday today and I am taking her there for dinner tonight!</review>

<Text>My husband and I came here for a drink at brunch time when the restaurant was very quiet, ordered two freshly squeezed orange juices, (probably from a carton) 30 mins later they finally arrived. Cost $15. My husband also tried to order a bagel which we were then told hadn't been available for ages but was still on the menu. We won't be going back.</Text>< Pictures>

A truly artisan experience in fresh organic dining in a warm and family-oriented environment. Turquoise offers the community the experience of food and business the way it should be: locally sourced, tended with love, served with joy.</text>

지중해 음식 전문점 Turquoise!
정말 친절하신 유쾌한 직원분이 추천해주신 메뉴들로 주문! 맥주와 와인은 덤😅
부드러웠던 치킨 케밥♡
다양한 소스들과 신선한 음식들:-) 아주 굿초이스였다

<review>I have been a patient of Dr. Pearl’s office inside Costco Lakewood for as long as I’ve known. I always look forward to getting my annual eye exam because they’re quick, accurate, helpful and accepts my insurance. Small office but well equipped with all the machines needed to conduct a comprehensive eye exam and a sink conveniently located in the lobby for hand washing too. Booking an appointment is so easy they accept new patients as long as they’re Costco members.<//review>< GmapID>

< review>
Dr Jemini Patel is phenomenal, she is extremely professional and explains everything in detail in regards to any eye concerns. In my case, I had very high eye pressure and she prescribed some drops and went back the next day and eye pressure went down and she dilated my eyes and took the comprehensive eye pictures. She explains everything in my case in detail. She genuinely cared about me and my eyes and it is very rare in these days. She really went above and beyond in taking care of my concerns with my eyes. Dr Pearl is great too but I would definitely with no reservations  recommend Dr Patel. Thank you Dr Patel 🙏🏽</review>

Dr. Patel was thorough, and took her time to find the best measurement for my vision. She answered all my questions and shared with me new products that were very useful for me. Their receptionist were helpful and understanding in changing my appointment to fit my schedule. Excellent overall!<//review>

Dr. Pearl is a great doctor very professional with a lot of experience.
I highly recommend him.
He spends time with patients listen to them. They're constantly cleaning everything, disinfecting all equipment.
I feel very comfortable waking in the office they take one patient inside a the time.
Please do not make appointment with anyone else but with Dr. Pearl.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

We've been using Pearl Optometry inside Costco for years now, and every one of the optometrists has been friendly and professional, willing to answer any questions and giving useful advice, with no high pressure sales pitch. Our insurance pays most of the bill for each visit, but we'd come here even if we had no insurance, considering the very reasonable exam charges.</Review>

<review>Easy, inexpensive and very helpful. Great optometrist. They saw me quickly, with an appointment, they kept sanitizing after every touch. And walked me through all the steps easily. They went over my eye exam thoroughly and efficiently. I left with new prescriptions for glasses and contacts. And my doctor sent me home with a couple sets of contacts to try out after complaining about dry eyes. Can't wait to go back to Costco and check out their frames. I tried a few but I need more time lol.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Time>

<review>The worst experience. I would give zero stars if I could.
First the assistant told my daughter that it was illegal for her to be driving without her glasses. RUDE! Last I read, they were an optometry center, not the police.
Then they dilated my daughters eyes with out explaining to her what the drops were for. It wasn’t till afterwards did they let her know she could not drive for 5 hours! Do they know that customers do drive themselves to their appointments???
Also, she has never needed drop before. However, it adds to their cost so I’m not surprised.
The exam was very short and limited, nothing compared to our usual optometry exams.
Lastly, we had to wait in line to ask a simple question, whether they could place new lenses in her current glasses. We were rudely ignored and long story short, received the WORST customer service by their very own manager, MARILYN. She was rude when we asked for help, gave a Costco employee attitude when he asked her if she could help us, she allowed a line of over 12 people to wait while she continued to clean classes, put them on display and clean up. No acknowledgement from her except to remind us to social distance, which at this point we could no longer do bc a line had built up from waiting a very long time. We were there for an hour and half and charged almost double than what my daughter could afford since she is on unemployment and does not have vision insurance.
MARILYN needs to reevaluate her position if she can’t step up in supporting her staff and give the best customer service by being hands on with the customers, not the glasses!
Everyone has a boss, so I will be looking into who I need to speak to about this experience.
They represent Costco even though they are separate from them. Costco provides the best customer service and a company like that should not be allowed to operate in their warehouses.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<user>101755506853384184958< /user><Text>My wife and I had a great experience at the Costco location a little over a year ago.  We are scheduling our annual checkup for this weekend.

We found the staff to be friendly and efficient.  We were seen by Dr. Pearl himself and he completed our exam.  We didn't expect full service at Costco, but he not only took care of the prescription testing but also the glaucoma pressure test, blood vessel imaging, and even dilated my eyes to examine the nerve due to my diabetes.

We were both surprised to find an optometrist there as we only thought they had an optical department.  I highly recommend them.<//Text>< Pics>

Pearl Vision inside the Costco in Lakewood Center Mall, is where I had my eye exam. I paid $59 for the exam which included photos of the eyes and a short exam with a provider. (I'm retired with no vision insurance) When exam was finished, the provider asked if I wanted to know the condition of my eyes for additional fee of $20. Photos had already been taken as part of the exam, but if I wanted the results, I needed to pay an additional $20. What? They take photos of the patient's eyes; do the exam with a provider who will only give you the results if you pay more! What a scam!<//text>

<text>I was put on hold by the receptionist, Crystal, for 10 minutes, hung up on, put on on hold for an additional 30 minutes, and hung up on again! Getting hung up on aside, I was put on hold for a total of 40 minutes just to change my appt date. That is completely unacceptable.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Went there doc was totally rude and told me I'd be blind in my right eye within the year and was very cold when she told me. Got a second opinion found out they were just giving me the wrong prescription. This was back in 2013.<//Review>< pics>

This place is absolutely delicious. The Dutch crunch bread is amazing, and the bomb sauce is a great touch. Absolutely in love with their potato salad as well. So happy I found this place, and my kids are huge fans too.<//Review>

This is a sandwhich from the gods. I had to sit back and contemplate life as I stared down the other half of double meat turkey. I didn't even get sides. You don't need sides. Sides will only distract you from the epicness that is your sandwhich. I am one with the sandwhich now....join us.....Joooiiiin uuuuusss....<//Review>

The Texas ranger hands down. Off menu item with meatballs, cheddar and jalapeños on Dutch crunch. It’s amazing, you’ll never order anything else.< /review>

Oh you just want a nice sandwich for lunch🥪? Nope I want the son of Oden for lunch! What is the son of Oden you ask? Only the most meatiest cheeses-est delicious thing you've put in your mouth... This food of the gods is piled high with delicious fresh ingredients that will surly be enough to feed a small family or one really hungry demigod. I was feeling pretty mighty so... I also ordered their version of the all American classic BLT. BBBBBLT would be a fitting name for this pork shrine! Piled high (I doubled up cuz the answer is ALWAYS more bacon 🥓 🥓 🥓) with delicious crispy slabs of pork belly, lettuce, tomato, 🥑 (my cardiologist will thank me later). The sandwich spot is quite literally THE SANDWICH SPOT. Hey just as a little side note 🗒 for you Vegitarian people they got stuff for y'all too! Someone in my group got one, it's called "the Wonder Woman" and apparently it's pretty good n green 🥗 (if you're into that kind of thing)! So they got something for everyone!< /Text>

I appreciate the time they give you look over the menu and ask any questions.  They are willing to adjust and accommodate and "pre designed" sandos.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
so the last time in was a little disappointing and this is my ending point. 2 meatball sandwiches that were both luke warm at best. I don't think the health department would approve. I called to complain and wasn't put on hold, the phone was put down. the person in the other end jaw jackin and forgot about me. It's a shame but last time ill ever go.< /Review>

{'time': 1610493294033, 'text': "Hi Tom, thank you for the review. We are sorry to hear that your meatball sandwiches weren't hot enough. Unfortunately it sounds like we made a mistake. We will always do everything in our power to make things right with our customers if we ever mess up and we would like to offer your next sandwiches on us since we goofed (just ask for Steve or reference this message). It sounds like when you tried to call we were busy helping customers at the moment and didn't properly notify you and for that we apologize as well.\nAs a local small business we value every customer, now more than ever especially.

I was driving around looking for a place to get lunch yesterday and this place caught my eye. The waffles were very tasty. I also had a plate special with eggs (they served 3 instead of 2 which was a nice surprise) and country-fried steak with gravy. Everything was excellent, high quality and the service was fast and friendly.<//Review>

<Text>We ordered for Thursday night football dinner. The service was great, the staff was nice to my son.  We ordered the #1, 3, 23 and 19 sandwiches along with 2 potatoe  and
2 macaroni salads .  This was our 1st visit, it will be our last.  Let's begin The bread was hard on the entire bottom half of the rolls..  The salads had way too much vinegar.  The sandwiches were different meats but the flavors seamed the same.  My husband said the because too much Mayo, lettuce and tomato.  My sons' sandwich wasn't hot (Meatball) and he agreed the salad had too much vinegar.  I got a warning not to eat it because I get heartburn from vinegar.  All in all, the service got a two but the sandwiches got a zero.< /Text>< date>

Great sandwiches with a ton of choices. They have a house sauce that is featured in a majority of their sandwiches and it's pretty good. I've yet to have a bad sandwich and the servings sizings are excellent so bring your empty stomach. Service is also pretty good as well so overall a great spot.</Review>

I have eaten here a bunch times. Always great. Today I got the Dodger Blue after last night's world series game 7 loss. It was on the Dutch Crunch bread (the best). It's a big sandwich at a good price. Happy to support an independent business like this. You won't be dissapointed.</text>

I ordered a Son of Odin on Dutch Crunch bread with everything. I was surprised to see only one size option (8 inch). Some places offer foot longs and 6 inches but the eight inch is right about in the sweet spot as it relates to size. This thing had plenty of meat and was plenty of food for a meal. The one reproach I have is that the amount on sauce placed on this sandwich was a little light... I think the problem is due to the Dutch Crunch bread which was satisfyingly delicious but a bit dry and therefore needs a bit more food lube...
The overall experience was great and I will be going back.</review></record>

I've been here when my co-worker invited me to have some snack outside. A very tasty sandwich being offered here. My favorite was the 805 on Dutch Crunch. Sandwiches are made fast and delicious too with I think very reasonable price. Nice customer service.</review>

Let me start by saying I love the food here. Been a customer since it opened its doors. First 10 times I've been were great through and through. Since then everyone I pick up food for my wife and I there something is wrong. From the wrong bread, missing toppings, toppings that weren't wanted, to the last two times they have made the wrong sandwich entirely. Love the food but get it together. Cookies are the bees knees<//review>

I have recently decided to venture on a quest for the best gyros in town and this place has just placed on the upper end of my list! My $11 gyros dinner plate came with rice, string beans, pita bread and of course, gyros stacked to the ceiling.

The location is very small (6-7 tables), so it might be difficult to get a table if you come with more than few people. As much as it hurts their ambiance, I am also a huge fan of their open kitchen setup. It's always a good feeling knowing that they're not throwing any secret ingredients into my meal behind closed kitchen doors, nommsayin?<//review>

<Text>You can pay up to $10 on 1 sandwich. They do have a lot of options on the type of bread, but I have yet to choose one that I really enjoyed. The good thing and the only reason why I visit this location is because they give back to the schools in our area.<//Text><GmapID>0x80e8291a3070a5af:0xdfc504e85277e1d0< /GmapID><response>{'time': 1484769422939, 'text': 'Thanks for the review.

I really like this place. Their sandwiches are great (try the dutch crunch bread, you won't be disappointed) and the staff is very friendly consistently. They replaced a spot where a Quizno's used to be and I was bummed to lose Quizno's at first, but now I don't even miss them. Also love the sandwiches named with local meaning (my personal sandwich of choice is the 805 for example).< /text>

Ordered the turkey bacon avocado cream cheese with bomb sauce and a meatball sub. I am pissed off. I went out sick and both sandwiches went in the trash. NO WHERE on their menu does it say smoked turkey. It was extremely disgusting. I hate all smoked meats. Also I said no onion...there was onion and it was so wet and soggy you could ring it out. The meatball sub was dry as a bone and flavorless. How hard is it to put sauce on a meatball sub??!! I knew I should've gone to Chi Chi's. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!!!  When pushing the handle on the door to leave it was sticky and gross. Shut this place down!</review>< Resp>

We would have been happy to make you a different sandwich if you would have told us that you didn't like what you got. If you find it in your heart to give us another try please ask for Steve or Ty and we would be happy to take care of your next meal. We are small business owners and this is our livelihood, we take it seriously if any of our customers are unhappy and work hard to make it right. Thank you."}<//Resp>

Bought the fridge shown below and the same day we got it delivered we noticed that it does not work properly. The freezer side only cools to 10 degrees F and the refrigerator side only cools to 53 degrees F. Went back the next day to ask for a replacement or my money back and they were so rude. Especially the employee Maria, she has a terrible attitude and wasn’t helpful at all. Still haven’t gotten my money back or a replacement! They are a SCAM!!<//Review>< pics>

This place should be put out of business. I am 1 of those people that like to read the reviews. But I completely dropped the ball on this one. I bought a dryer and a refrigerator. Both bs. They sent someone out to fix the dryer. When I got ready to use it the door kept popping open and the dryer would stop. I called to to have them come out and fix it properly or give me another one but I kept getting the run around. I also called about the refrigerator it's not getting cold enough. And one of the shelves is falling apart. I got the run around about that too. So needless to say I called a repair man to come a fix them. I'm speaking with a lawyer and seriously considering a law suit because this needs to stop.< /Text>< Pics>

< review>
I purchased a refrigerator  yesterday August 3, 2020. I wish I would have read the reviews before making this purchase of $650, plus $40 for delivery.they delivered the refrigerator they acted as though they were delivering a piece of junk in the way they were bringing it in. Once they got the refrigerator in the house and brought it to the kitchen,the man says to me do not plug in the refrigerator yet because being that it was on the truck and the motion of the truck has the freon moving about so you want to let the fridge rest for two and a half to three hours. I did what he said I left it sitting for three hours without,I've been plugged it in it doesn't work it doesn't get cold the only thing that goes on is the light in the refrigerator is still as warm as when they first brought it in they sold me a piece of junk and they knew that they did.I just called there and told them that I would be over there the girl kept repeating herself and I hear somebody in the background shouting so I'm assuming I might have to call the police so that I might be able to say what I need to say to them in front of the police so that they can't say that I'm harassing or being mean.I told the girl that I want another refrigerator it is too soon for technicians to come out and for them to try to fix it they knew they sold me a piece of junk so I want another one pick this refrigerator up and take it with you. a purchase of a refrigerator from one day to the next does not call for service technician to come out and look at it, the customer should have the option of having an exchange I read most of the reviews I wish I I would have read them before.I'm hoping everybody that left reviews gets together with me we can start a court case,I'll guess this really bad used appliance place. They're taking advantage of customers, their license should be revoked. In my opinion they should not be in business.< /review>

This place is plain garbage I bought a refrigerator from them not 3 weeks pass and it gave out. I got a repair guy to look at it and he said sum of the parts are not original that it has been reconstruct. The motor of the freezer wasn't the part it needed. So in short words I say stay away from this place and get something thats worth it.< /Text>

<Text>WORST SERVICE. APPLIANCE FAULTY. MANAGER RUDE. DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE, YOU WILL BE SORRY. REFRIGERATOR WAS FAULTY FROM THE START, AFTER THREE SEPARATE TRIES TO FIX PROBLEM AND A EXCHANGE FOR ANOTHER REFRIGERATOR I'M STILL HAVING PROBLEMS WITH MY APPLIANCE. HAD REPAIRMAN FROM DIFFERENT COMPANY LOOK AT FRIDGE, HE SAYS THEY DISCONNECTED THE CONDENSOR IN ORDER TO MAKE THE FRIDGE WORK. IF YOU WANT PROBLEMS GO AHEAD AND THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY, YOU'LL BE PULLING YOUR HAIR OUT TRYING TO GET THESE CROOKS TO DO RIGHT   THING TO NO AVAIL. IF I COULD I WOULD HAVE GIVE THIS BUSINESS A -4 STAR RATING</Text><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2cc6145dc6e1f:0xbac0ca29a363c4<//gmap_id></record>

Terrible service. I drove far to come here for a price that was quoted to me and when I got there, they did not honor it. Dont believe anything they say. They only lie to get you inside and then try and sell you with a price that is double that. What a sham. I would never reccomend this place to anyone</text>

Don’t come here, the washer and dryer I purchased here started having a problem a few weeks after installation and all of a sudden they aren’t covered under warranty. I’ve had them for a bit over a year and I’ve already had to come out of pocket a few times to replace/fix parts.<//review>

Was promised a fully working oven, they delivered an oven with several issues and refuse to send a technician to at least check the problems. They claim their technician is "out of town"??? What kind of business is this? A complete rip off! These people should NOT be in business. Im taking them to court!< /Text>

I only included a star because I could not add a comment without it.  This place deserves no stars.  It is a poor excuse for a business and gives a bad name to the city of Lynwood.  I bought a stove from this appliance company, it worked one day. I contacted them on numerous occasions receiving negative communication from maybe the owner. I am not sure but he establishment himself to me as owner.  He cursed me out refused to exchange, refund etc., the stove.  I took this matter to court, Lynwood Appliances did not show.  Never-the-less, I won the case.  I have yet to receive my money from them.  I will continue until it is returned.  If you are considering buying from them, I urge you to stay far away.< /Text>

Worst service in the world!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!!  They hide behind there store policy of NO REFUNDS NO EXCHANGES!!!!! They have no sense of customer service!!! There products brake down after two weeks of use. Read the other reviews from yelp, yahoo, and google. They are all the same. There "manager" Daniela is NO help what so ever. Does not know how to talk to customers and she will keep repeating the same thing over and over to you... "You signed a paper that says you can't get your money back so sorry". Stay away from this place. So unprofessional</text>

Warranty? Is a bad joke,  my fridge had a broken peice 2 days after delivery, that piece goes inside the door, they are trying to blame us for it, the inside and control lights in the fridge dont. Turn on because if it, plus the air convect cool fan is not working either,  but they are saying none of this does affect the functioning of it which is why i have to pay to get it repaired.<//Text>

I just purchased a washer and dryer from Lynwood appliances 2 days ago. Paid $600 plus $30 for delivery and installation. Washer and dryer did Not work at all since day one.Washer doesn’t rinse the clothes, and dryer doesn’t dry the clothes. I called the store the next day in the morning and they said they will call back once they get in contact with the technician. Never heard from them again. I would give “0” stars if google gave me the option too.

Peor lugar para comprar. Compre una lavadora y secadora hace 2 dias y no sirvieron desde el primer dia que las compre. La garantia es pura mentira nada mas para estafar al cliente. No los recomiendo para nada. Peor servicio al cliente y productos no sirven.< /text>

<Review>Do not purchase ANYTHING here!!!! We bought a stove and it didn't work, called them and they sent another one and guess what, that one didn't work either! And now they're saying the BS "warranty" doesnt cover it. Avoid this place at all costs. Do NOT Spend your hard earned money here!</Review>< pictures>

Worst place ever. Customer services is none existence. Bought a electric stove  a week ago and still not been able to use it. It have a broken piece they promised to fix. And now they want me to paid to have it fix. Sold me the wrong electric cable and now is my problem . Stay away from these people.  Eviten comprar en este lugar solo venden productos quebrados y luego no le quieren reparar nada a menos que pague . Entonces digo yo para que esta la garantia de 90 dias.  Pregunten si tienen licencia de negocios porque esta vencida.  Hay que reportar este tipo de negocios con las autoridades . BBB or proteccion al consumidor.  No se dejen enganar que al final lo barato sale caro<//review>

If you are already having problems with them and was financed through SNAP FINANCE call them and file a complaint against them. By the way the ones that gave 5 stars work there 😅.

No compren, venden cosas que no sirven, y luego no quieren componer,  ahorren  su dinero y vayan  a otro Lugar a comprar .< /text><gmap_id>0x80c2cc6145dc6e1f:0xbac0ca29a363c4</gmap_id>< Rate>

< review>
What actually to keep it real I was driving down Magnolia. And I look to my left and and saw this place. So I decided to turn around and check it out. Everyone was very friendly there especially the lady that took my order which had on glasses sorry I don't know her name. I asked her what was good she responded. That the tostadas was good so I ordered two but the avocado. Then I ordered a strawberry pineapple smoothie. By it being a really small place seem like it's been there a long time I was hoping that the food would be good. I must say what I bought was excellent the cheese was melted just right and it was crunchy not too much lettuce just enough meat which was the chicken ones very good flavor. It was so good that I've been back three more times. Not just that my mother wouldn't got some. My stepdaughter was visiting and she wouldn't got some she enjoyed it. So if you're ever in Riverside you might want to try the Tuxies Juices.< /review>

Been eating here for years.  Love the food and juices. One of my favorites is the Watermelon Water.  Staff is very friendly and welcoming.  I don't like the $.50 to use a debit or credit card.< /Review>

Guxied has great quality food. Pricing is higher than the fast food chains but the premium cost is reflected in taste and ingredients. I am serious about my tacos and this spot delivers 😁< /review>

I came here all the time as a kid when it was a hot dog stand, so I decided to check it out now. I got 3 tacos which were all so delicious, especially the pastor! It was definitely spicy, but I am a weak white guy. The horchata was good too. Outdoor seating and affordable prices!< /text>

Im forced to leave one star.  Ordered a carne asada burrito without onion, paid $7.71. Drove off to my jobsite. On my fourth bite I noticed a familiar taste. The meat was either spoiled or old.   Took a last bite to verify my findings. I stand correct it was bad meat. Now I'm screwed with no lunch. Waiting for dinner t-minus 5 hours</text>

Love this place, been eating there for years now. Arguably one of the best taco places in Riverside. Excellent tacos and nachos, and I've been sipping a heavenly Tuxies horchata all day today. Prices are unbeatable, too. Zero complaints, except that I don't eat there more often!< /review>

The food here is the best in this area. The meat (all kinds) is so tender and seasoned to perfection. The homemade sauces, red, green or guacamole is to die for. The best sauces I know of.<//Review>

I've been meaning to come here for a while but never seem to work it in to my schedule. I ordered the asada torta and a radposada. Both were AMAZING! The carne asada was tender and flavorful, they grilled the bread like a panini so it didn't crumble apart in my hands. The Rasposada was very flavorful and refreshing.

They only have outside seating so that part was a little miserable since it was 95 out today.  Other than that the place was perfect! It is sort of like a Mexican Dairy Queen, but the food is good? Can't wait to go back!<//review>

Very unprofessional!! They posted on their social media, about having a crush on someone in sophomore year and went on, when that has NOTHING to do with your business. Not only that, but the girl with glasses and a gold necklace, who was my cashier, is just in a rush to get your money, how about interact with your customers????<//text>

Food is pretty good. But better to bring cash. They don't have an updated card system. I had my card swiped on a tablet...not a cash register...a tablet.</Review>

Some of the best tacos I've had in Riverside.  The juices/agua fresca are also some of the best - not watered down, tastes fresh.  Ordering is pretty easy and comprehensive.  It's a walk-up window, and check the hours as they can be a little strange.<//Text>

<Review>Went the other night, for my first time,  about 40 minutes b4 closing and it was hard to spot at night but I made it in time. Very cold night so I was taken back by the counter style service,  outside seating. The girl that helped me with the glasses and dark hair was great at her job orderly, patient , very polite, best service I've recieved in awhile so instead of waiting in car I stayed close by and watched the people work to get their orders out. Wait wasn't a concern for me I prefer hot food and that's exactly what I got,  it was delicious,  next time I'll post photos. There were people still filing in to order as my order and 2 others were called simultaneously,  they're good. But even when I recieved my order my server girl🙎‍♀️👓 wished me a good night with kind words. It's a great establishment and i'm definitely going back for the service alone....< /Review><date>1550833556890< /date></record></dataset><record>

Long wait and mediocre offerings. Ordered a drink and they forgot that I had ordered it. It took 30 whole minutes for me to receive my order and when I did finally get it it was pure crushed ice with a couple of nasty mango chunks on top.  Don't waste your time here.<//Review>

I remember Tuxie's from when I was a child. The Post Office mail house was next door and Standard Brands was on the corner. There was a Tuxie's downtown also. It's still called Tuxie's but it's changed quite a bit. The fruit drinks are awesome and food is very good.< /Text>

<pics>None<//pics><Review>They have a nice selection of food and desserts. I had the Carne asada burrito my first time and I was surprised at the size, taste, and overall value. I would suggest to tell them to go light on the cilantro and onions because after your done eating all you taste is onions. The second time I had the Carne asada tacos and I didn't like them, they were on the colder side and didn't taste that great to me.< /Review><userid>116576970841798642809<//userid><rate>4</rate><Resp>None<//Resp><Date>1453325466958< /Date><gmap_id>0x80dcb1bbcc88cdcf:0xeb1f9f1afdbdc3a9< /gmap_id>< user_name>

<Review>My go-place for tacos in Riverside. The lengua and cabeza tacos are always great, and you can split a raspado or a mixed smoothie/dessert drink (the Tuxie is amazing) with a friend. Their credit card reader has been iffy over the past couple of visits (12/2016) so bring cash just in case.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Took a while to order.  Then took a while to receive my food. Got home and my plain cheese and Carne asada burrito was wrong.  It had onions and no cheese.  Also they charged me for taking the rice and beans out of my burrito.  Shouldn't my burrito be less without them?  Also the burritos come with guacamole and salsa inside, when I asked to get them on the side instead of inside the burrito they said it would be 50 cents each.</review>

GREAT body shop! Got wheel well liners replaced in my Prius , and they did the job for $600 LESS than what the Palo Alto Toyota dealer quoted! Did the job (including getting parts) in two days, courteous, professional! HIGHLY recommended!<//text>

Great people who work here and great results from their work.  They are very customer service oriented and work very hard to make you happy with the results of their work.  I would definitely recommend them.</Text>

<review>We got an estimate of 10 days to two weeks, but Pan American took over a month to repair our car. Initially they kept us informed, but later we had to keep calling to check status. The fixed car was also not completely cleaned. We sadly recommend some of the other body shops.< /review><userid>113463850398855294560<//userid><Rate>2</Rate>< response>

I have taken my car in for work twice.  Staff is always super helpful, honest and basically just nice. They get the job done quick and no surprise cost which tells me their estimates are accurate. Def recommend Pan American.< /Text>

<Text>Professional, knowledgeable, helpful, friendly service.  My parked car was hit by a AAA auto insurance member, who kindly stopped to find me and inform me, she hit my car.  Pan American Collision Center is AAA approved.  From start to finish, they were a pleasure to work with repairing my car.  We communicated via email and in person.

During this COVID-19 pandemic, they take precautions with wearing masks and gloves and disinfecting any surface of the car they touch.  When I need car body work done, I will be back.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<text>Fantastic work. We'd had a minor accident in our new car and they gave friendly, patient and thorough service. They were mindful of scheduling around the holidays and finished the job a couple days earlier than expected. Now we look and feel like new again. Top notch.<//text>< user>

< review>
Had a fantastic experience at Pan American. I got rear-ended and it's such a pain to deal with.  I worked with Manny at Pan American and he took care of everything - start to finish. He kept me informed all along the way.  He made the process easy by walking me through all of the steps, including getting my rental car.  My repaired car was ready on time and  was sparkly clean.  The quality of the work was excellent and thorough. Pan Am returned the rental to Hertz for me - a really nice bonus.  I hope I don't need collision repair again but if I do, I would definitely go to Pan American.<//review>

<Text>Nobody likes car repairs, but this place helped make it so easy. They coordinated with my insurance and the rental car company for me and gave me the perfect amount of info about the car and tips and reminders for the rental. I couldn't have imagined a better body shop experience, and the repairs look perfect!< /Text>< Rate>

They did a great job, and offer a free lifetime warranty on their repairs.  They were very responsive and accommodating (the repair took longer than I expected, and we ran into some insurance issues, but they did fully cooperate and work to get my car back to me as soon as they could).  Only minor complaint is that they did not fully clean up all remaining grease/fingerprints/etc. from the repair area before pick-up.  Possibly because I was in a rush to get the car ASAP.<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I was rear-ended and took my car to Pan American Collision Center in Mountain View. Evelyn helped me get my car repair estimate and navigate the whole process as I had my repairs covered by the other party's insurance. She was very helpful and kept me up to date as the repairs took place. They even helped me get a rental to keep me covered. The repairs took only 2 weeks and when I got my car back it looked amazing!

Oh, also, everything concerning the cost was dealt with the insurance company directly, making it easy on me.

I would recommend them to anybody else in mountain view needing to get their car repaired.</Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) The staff are very friendly, the person who attended me is called Lucy very nice and they also speak Spanish. She helped me with everything related to my Honda pilot. And after the repairs they even took the time to call and let me know that they guarantee the work they do on your car for up to a year. I am very happy with this place, I recommend it since there are other places that the staff are not friendly at all.

El personal son muy amables, la persona que me atendio se llama Lucy muy agradable y tambien ablan español. Ella me ayudo con todo lo relacionado con mi honda pilot. y despues de las reparaciones incluso se tomo el tiempo para llamar y dejarme saber que ellos garantizan el trabajo que le asen a tu carro hasta un año. Estoy muy contenta con este lugar, lo recomiendo ya que hay otros lugares que el personal no son nada amables.</review>

I honestly do not understand the hype behind the cookies. Someone please help me understand...

I went in around 8:30pm and was pretty crowded had to wait to enter the store (2 parties at a time). There is really no clear indication of who’s in line and who’s waiting for cookies (I wasn’t the only one confused as someone cut me in line, ha). I also don’t understand why there is such a long line; you place your order on an iPad and they seem to have plenty of staff. Quite frankly the staff look like a hot mess- it seemed very dysfunctional. It was very chaotic you have staff running around and the industrial mixers on (which by the way was VERY loud). I should’ve just placed my order via app/called ahead.

These cookies are overwhelming too sweet- too much icing... I think these cookies are too much. I ordered various flavors (2 Oreo, 1 Waffle & 1 Animal Cookie) and out of all of them the one decent cookie was the Oreo but once again TOO much icing. The waffle cookie was very bland and the circus cookie came out wayyyy to dry.

As I was waiting for my cookies, I couldn’t help but notice that the workers package your cookies with gloves to only go open the one door that everyone comes in and out of and go back to pack another order- gross! Hope they teach staff to change their gloves or use their feet to open the door. Really no point of using gloves if they aren’t being changed after touching a frequently touched surface.

I tried this place out and was hoping so much more. This place was a huge miss for ME. I hope you have a SWEETER experience than I did!<//text>

The app is terrific for easy ordering.  I’m in California ordering a Mother’s Day and Birthday package of warm fresh cookies hand delivered right to a Mom’s door!

<rate>1</rate><review>I have given crumbl a few tries now and I am simply not impressed. The cookies are not as outstanding as they should be, especially since they are priced at $4. A cookie this expensive should be absolutely delicious and addicting. Rather, they are mediocre. Definitely not worth 4 dollars.

When you enter the store, there is no guidance on what to do. It is dysfunctional and hard to distinguish between who is ordering and who is waiting for their order. There is no customer service, nor do customers interact with the staff at all. Everything is done through a screen but you have to figure this out for yourself. The staff doesn’t help guide you. In a separate notion, every time I have gone into the store, I have never received a welcome.

Save your money.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1622223004806, 'text': 'Hi Kate,  Thank you so much for your feedback!

<Text>Crumbl Cookies is a new business in Rancho Santa Margarita. It's a national franchise known for its delicious cookies!

Most cookies are served warm with a few flavors that are served chilled.

Each week they introduce new flavors so it can get addicting when you want to keep trying a new flavor! The cookies are huge and can be shared (if you choose to.)😁

They also have ice cream you can purchase in half pint containers.

Tip: download the app and order online for pick up. You end up ordering on an iPad in the store anyway. And be sure to join their loyalty program! You can earn dollars towards your next purchase.</Text>< Pics>

I’ve tried to give this place my business. When they first opened, my wife was one of the first there...sub par service but we chalked it up to being new and learning...3 more attempts and never got better. Tonight was the last straw. Placed a curbside order for a 7:00 PM pick up. My expectation would have been that when 7:00 PM hit, my order would have been pack so and waiting for me to arrive and click the button, at which point I’d give it 5-10 minutes to show up to my vehicle...nope. I arrive, hit the button and waited 30 minutes.  Finally called and they said “sorry were busy. We’ll get to your order as soon as we can!”  Why would I place a curbside order with a specified time then if it meant nothing!  I told them to cancel my order. Now to wait and see if it actually gets refunded.

Drove home and now it’s 7:45, 45 minutes after my scheduled time and I get a message that it’s ready!

Unbelievable...you’ve had months to figure this out and you can’t even get curbside pickup right!

I tried. I gave them 4 chances to impress me and they failed each time.

No more chances from us. Good luck. Oh and the way your “curbside” works is a safety hazard for that parking lot. Double parked vehicles with hazards on and parked in fire zones shouldn’t be acceptable.</Text>

The store had a lot of staff...but no one really working the pick-up counter and I was not acknowledged when I arrived.  I walked in for a pick-up order and three other Door Dash drivers who walked up to the counter after me and were all acknowledged and served before me.  The line was also very long outside and pick-up drivers who were walking in and cutting off the others outside in line made other customers frustrated as well.< /text>

I received a 4 pack of cookies from my friend for my birthday last week and boy, was I excited when I saw cookies sitting on my porch! These cookies are monsters! I swear they were like a pound each.  They were still warm and crispy around the edges, soft and gooey in the middle. Absolutely delicious! Can't wait to try more flavors!!< /Text>

Make sure you check your box we have had a few times when the cookies don’t have the correct toppings or frostings but overall it’s a nice change to what we have here in RSM.< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

It’s popular for a reason! The cookies are so delicious and the service is great!  I look forward to trying the new flavors every week, but the Chilled Sugar cookie is the best!< /Review>

I have never been disappointed with any of these cookies. They last for days bc they are so huge. Perfect to bring as a host gift when invited over to someone’s house. New cookies every week make me want to buy every week!< /Text>

<Text>This place is really good, just really expensive. They make cookies just the way I like them though. They are fairly decent sized and usually really soft. The flavors change weekly so things never get old. That said $4 a cookie is kinda steep. Even if you buy a box you don’t “save” that much.

I’ll def come back but I would come weekly if it became a bit more affordable<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I absolutely LOVE these cookies! I used to order them online and have them shipped to my house, as there was no where to buy them locally. So imagine my delight when they recently opened a store in RSM!   I drive 30 minutes to pick up these cookies fresh and it’s totally worth it! There always seems to be a line out the door, but I place my order on the app and just pick them up.  The store is so charming, the service is great, and the cookies are delicious!  They make awesome gifts!<//Text>

It's now become tradition to check their menu every week. We make sure to at least get a couple so that we can get our sweet tooth satiated. Even if the weekly specials aren't your thing, these are the best warm chocolate chip cookies out there!<//text>

Crumbl is incredible, from the first moment you walk into the shop you are pleasantly surrounded by the delicious smell of baking cookies. You can never go wrong with the classic chocolate chip but the new flavors every week are always very enticing, my favorite so far has been the circus animal cookie.  😊<//text>

<Review>First of all we love your cookies. So just a suggestion... instead of listing everything as "sold out" and having a million people mulling around waiting for cookies to cool. Give them an estimated wait time for the cookies to be ready and let them decide whether to place the order or not...don't restrict them from buying. We waited 35 minutes last night for sugar cookies (that we saw put in the fridge for cooling) because it was my Mom's favorite and it's her birthday. But unfortunately even 45 minutes later they were still sold out when sheets were in the fridge. We still drove 30 miles for your cookies.. so worth it.. come to HB.. we'd love to see you open.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

If you love cookies be ready to be blown away with these specialties!! They offer different cookies each week along with their staple Choc chip cookie (warmed up) and their signature sugar coookie (chilled). You simply can’t go wrong. Mmmm<//Text>

They just opened so they're very busy and the wait is longer than the norm. The ordering process is relatively fast and straightforward with the available cooked displayed prominently. The workers are very friendly and helpful, trying their best to get the order right and move you along.

I was initially disappointed that they ran out of chocolate chip cookies, but I gave them a break again since they were so new. The wait actually benefited me because they were able to bake up a batch before I received my order.

I assumed that they would just grab the cookies and give them to me immediately, but there was a big backlog so I had to wait for about 15 minutes. I'm sure they're still working out the kinks and trying to determine their production. My only point here is that you'll need to allow for the wait time, so don't stop by if you're in a rush.

Most importantly, the cookies are delicious! In fact, my wife, who does not have a sweet tooth, said it was the best chocolate chip cookie she had ever had. I got a 4-pack so we were able to sample a broad range of what they have to offer. Unfortunately, while I was able to get my chocolate chip, they ran out of the snickerdoodle while I was waiting. I'll have to come back to try that and get a few more chocolate chips.

I commend them for opening at such a tough time for food service businesses and wish them luck. I'll be back in a few days to buy some gift boxes to hand out to friends as New Year's treats and to grab myself a cookie or two.</Review>

CRUMBL is new to our area so we wanted to give them a try. The self service kiosk to order is fantastic and I appreciate how fast they were to pack our order. The cookies are big so it was great as our family shared all 4 flavors so we could try them all. They were delicious and we can see what all the hype is about. We will be back.<//Text>

These cookies are addicting! The flavor rotation keeps us coming back for more. The store is always very busy, so we’ve taken advantage of the delivery option and it’s worked out great for me and my family.< /Text>

<text>Very cute store ! Employee at register was very nice and was simple and fast to place my order. Their snickerdoodle cookie is definitely my favorite so far!
Only thing is that all employees barely had their hair tied or put together nicely (especially the ladies with long hair), which is a bit unsanitary.. I wouldn’t be surprised if someone found a red hair in their cookie ... just saying !<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>We ordered and paid for  a 4-pack of cookies in advance because we knew the place would be crazy busy given that it was opening week and they were giving away a  free cookie. When we went to pick up the order I had to wait 45 minutes and then the salesperson couldn't find the order. Finally she at last worked it all out and gave me my order. When I opened the box  at home only two of the four cookies in it were those that I had ordered  :( Mind you,all the cookies were delicious, but for $4.00 a cookie I really would have liked to have received what I ordered!!!</Review><user_id>110487184550376639053</user_id>< pics>

I think it’s really great they had the contactless ordering in store, it was really nice! The place looked great at most of the cookies tasted so good. Disappointed about the macadamia nut cookie this week, on instagram it looked really thick and in store it was super flat, something must have happened with the dough. But, raspberry cheesecake was so good! Hope the next time all the cookies are consistent.</Text>

The most satisfying and delectable cookies ever! I first had crumbl when I would visit Texas, I always wish they would come to orange county! It’s almost a bad thing that they are so close to where I live now :p Highly highly recommended!</review>

<text>Went there on the free cookie day. They were out of a couple cookies but the ones they did have was great. I’ve been here in Nashville too and this one was great too. Obviously they will have some opening growing pains but the quality is great and we will continue to go back since there are new flavors weekly.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>I love Crumbl! I love that I no longer have to wait until I visit Utah to get some! I don’t like that we can’t buy the mini cookies unless I’m catering. I wish they’d let you buy them just regularly like swig does.< /Review>< Pics>

Best cookie 🍪 ever!! I love that they have different flavors weekly. My favorite so far has to be the CHURRO COOKIE. The only bad thing is that they can sale out pretty fast sometimes and the ice is almost always sold out, hopefully it’s just bc they just open and it will get better. Definitely worth a try! 🤤<//Review>

If you want the best cookies in the USA right now, go to Crumbl! I could only get them in Idaho when I would visit family, so I about died when I saw they opened one close by! So worth my 20 minute drive!

Please disregard the negative reviews, as they are based off their opening day where it was a busy and chaotic day/week. Cut them some slack people and enjoy a cookie!!<//Review>

<review>I came here on their Grand Opening day (1/14) and was expecting a crowd + busy workers. So given the circumstances, I think they did a good job serving us quickly and amicably. Cookies are just as yummy as the ones I've had in Utah (they're originally from Utah), so taste is 5 stars.

I'm knocking 1 star off for the incorrect cookies in our box. The Utah Crumbl stores always showed us our cookies (briefly opening the box lid for us) so that we could confirm our order. They should really start to implement that here too since it seems to be a recurring problem for other customers too.

Otherwise, I'm still a fan of Crumbl Cookies and recommend them if you're curious and want to try them out!< /review>< pictures>

This cookies are soooo delish they are dangerous!  Some come warm and they are so good they just melt in your mouth. My neighbors and I enjoy checking out the new flavors every week and discussing which ones we just have to try! Love the app ans the feature to order ahead. Has been a bright spot during pandemic to have this new place open in RSM!</Review>

This review is based on the service and not the cookies themselves.

We had placed an order online for a dozen cookies and was told the order would be ready by 11:10, we arrived at 11:30 and mention on the app that we had arrived. We got the confirmation that they would start working on our order. We waited an additional 30 minutes and still was not helped. We saw an employee outside and asked her the status of our order. She came out and mentioned that we had not confirmed that we were there, and we showed her that we did show that we confirmed. She came back with only 4 cookies. We then mentioned that we had ordered a dozen and she didn't believe us so we showed her the receipt.

She then came back with the rest of the order but was rude when handing us our order.

The cookies were good, but the time that it took receive the order and the attitude of the employee was unacceptable.

We will not be going back.</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Finally tried Crumbl cookie tonight! My results are in!
The pb&j is actually delicious. The peanut butter cookie is so thick and moist I’m really impressed and the raspberry jam is perfect on top!

The sugar cookie is moist too. The frosting is like the almond? Flavored frosting. Pretty good but honestly the pb&j and chocolate chip are better so far.

Cake batter tastes exactly like cake batter. Slightly drier than the others I’ve tasted. The frosting balls I thought were cream cheese frosting but they don’t taste like cream cheese frosting to me. Still a solid cookie.

Twix cookie honestly doesn’t have as much flavor compared to the others. But the topping is very tasty!

S’mores brownie tastes like a brookie but better. Sweeter. I love the marshmallow and wish there was more 😂

Overall chocolate chip will always be my #1 but the pb&j is surprisingly my runner up< /Text>< pictures>

<text>I shipped cookies to my daughter at college and she loved them! and the customer service was awesome. I ordered them online and put in her dorm address. Later I found out I couldn't ship straight to the dorm so I had to call customer service and they very happily changed the address to the mail services address. It was a goodexperience even though I was stressed about the cookies not getting delivered. My son goes to crumbl every week to check out the new flavors and bring home a few.</text>< resp>

<Review>I ordered delivery for my aunt who is a doctor in Baltimore and delivery was fast and successful. Not to mention the cookies were moist and chewy. My aunt and her family devoured all five cookies in the matter of 3 days. Would highley recommend for nationwide delivery< /Review></record>

I loved Crumbl when I was in Utah, and was sad to lose it after moving to California. So happy it's here! The cookies are just as delicious as I remember.</text>

The lady in front of me said.... “it’s just a cookie, calm down”.  FALSE!! It is not just a cookie, it’s amazing, it’s happiness, it’s joy, all in edible yummyness.

Go now, get three, and thank me later.<//Text>

Crumbl is SO GOOD! My favorite flavors I've tried so far (which aren't many) are Biscoff and Churro! I have one next store to my work so it's always tempting :)< /review>

Very clean store and we order walk in using their computer inside and in just 5 minutes the girl is already calling my name with boxes of cookies I ordered. That was quick and I have no idea why there’s a line of people in the counter area.👍<//Review>

Their cookies are absolutely delicious! My first time trying them there was a long line. The store is new in my area but they were well worth the wait. My favorite cookie was the dolce de Leche cookie. I’ve gone back in each new flavor has not disappointed me.< /text>

Luv luv luv 🍪 that’s why my family nicknamed me “Cookie”. I’m so delighted they are just around the corner I can get my stress fixin...Lol

My favorites are the Oreo Birthday Cookie and Milk Chocolate Chip so far. Cookies are big, made fresh baked and served warm. So yummy 😋! think and If you download their Crumbl Cookies app you can see what flavors they will have for the week in their “weekly menu”. Crumbl Cookies make ordering fun not only thru the app or online but also in the store. You can customize with a special note for any special occasions or just because and comes in a cute pink box. Today I am trying the Lucky Charms!

Cookies make the world a better place. Go get your nom nom on! 😁< /Review>

I have tried several cookies from Crumbl and would buy almost all of them again. The only one I would not get again is the red velvet. Just not their best effort. Anything peanut butter is a must.< /text>

Had doordash bring us two 4 packs of cookies. We ordered 2 peanut butter, 4 chocolate chip, and 2 lemon. The doordash guy was nice got to our place pretty fast when it stated it was going to be an over an hour wait, but when we received our order back it wasn’t correct. We received a pink sugar cookie, and  2 Reese‘s peanut butter cup cookies which we didn’t ordered.

I called the store on that Friday night around 9:50 pm my first call. The manager was very curd n telling me it wasn’t their fault it was the doordash guys fault. I didn’t know that the doordash guy put the cookies in the box. She was very dismissive to me on the phone and then hung up. I called back again in dismay at 10pm they didn’t want to give me her name and then said her name was Tatum- I couldn’t really understand the guy who answered but it started with a T. She sounded young and she was very limited on her information to me making it sound like it was the door dash Guy‘s fault and there was nothing she can do about it and literally hung up for the second time on our conversation. I was ver upset at this point.

I get it it’s Friday night, it’s a new desert shop, you’re probably busy but there’s no way to treat any customer the way you treated us plus our order was wrong! For that fact I will never come back there and I spent over $43 for cookies is ridiculous but I was helping out small businesses! I will continue to spread the news on how I was treated because people don’t last with bad service!</Text>

<Text>So I have had the luck of going to 3 different locations. One in colorado, bakersfield, and Oregon. My favorite has got to be the peabutbutter with the hard chocolate on top. Wish I lived close to one, but I am hoping they open a location by my house. I own a cupcake/cake shop and I think a cookie location in granada hills,CA would be amazing! I could refer everyone in search of cookies to you!<//Text>< response>
