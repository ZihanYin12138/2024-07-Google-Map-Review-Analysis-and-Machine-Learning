<Text>Working with Shipmonk has been a great experience so far. It's significantly better than fulfilling in-house. Sometimes there are slight hiccups here and there but Erik and his team have been amazing at resolving any issues. I would 100% recommend to any friends.<//Text>< pics>

ShipMonk's newest and largest facility!
About 2 hours outside of LA

The way they use Robots in their automation to help send over 1 MILLION packages a month is so cool, I've never seen anything like it.

I highly recommend ShipMonk for your 3PL needs.< /review>

Absolutely the worst!

The experience with Shipmonk has been a nightmare to say the least and has cost my business thousands of dollars. The bottom line is they refuse to issue a refund when they make a mistake. When you file a claim, there is no claim number,  or confirmation they rcvd your claim. It just goes into a mysterious black-hole and you never hear about the issue again. It's very clear after talking to their management that they have a strict policy of not refunding customers when they make a mistake. Here are just a few examples of problems that we've had where they refuse to take responsibility

1) shipping product that isn't ours. we had customers complaining they rcvd random products that were not even ours. One customer received a mental health sweater! (after working with Shipmonk, I think I need that sweater), Shipmonk has refused to take responsibility even though we submitted claims showing the photos of the incorrect product.
2) shipping in the wrong packaging: We set-up customer packaging so some of our products would ship in poly-mailers. They told us this was set up and for a while it was working. For for the past month, instead of shipping in the correct package, they decided to ship in massive 20X20X12 boxes which increased our cost by 7 times! Now every package they ship costs $49 instead of $7.00. We even worked with one of their VP's to set up the custom packaging and had their assurances all was ok.
3)taking months to fulfill wholesale orders. If you need to send items to Amazon in a timely matter, you can forget about it. It takes their wholesale team literally months to send out a case to amazon or other wholesale account
4) Not able to fulfill Amazon FBM. They repeatedly missed the deadline causing our Amazon account to go into "high-risk" and nearly being shut down.
5) Took 2 months to fulfill e-commerce orders. We all knew there would be delays during the holiday, but as of January 10, we still have orders from Black Friday that have not been fulfilled. To make matters worse we have to offer refunds for products that were ordered on Thanksgiving that just arrived this week and Shipmonk is refusing to pay because they say they fulfilled the order.
6) Probably the most frustrating thing is that they try and sell you on Shipmonk by telling you that you will be able to scale your business because you won't have to worry about fulfilment. But the reality is me and my team and spending nearly all our time trying to babysit Shipmonk orders. It seems like all we do, every single day is trying to organize all the mistakes they make and try to pacify angry customers. We have angry retail shops, angry e-commerce customers, and no product in amazon because they can't do any of the things they promise. We have always prided on providing a great customer service experience, but Shipmonk has significantly hurt our reputation in the market.

I highly recommend using any other 3PL. While it's true that all 3PL's will make many mistakes, most 3PL's will do the right thing. Shipmonk clearly has created a business culture where they will do anything to try and avoid taking responsibility for mistakes they made. It's a very shady way of doing business and I don't expect they will be around for long unless they drastically change how they handle claims and customer complaints.<//text>

<review>This company is terrible. I was a client with Shipmonk for 2 years and here are just a FEW of the mishaps I had to deal with.

1. Support tickets go answered for days, weeks, MONTHS then mysteriously get marked as Resolved. I have to open another ticket to get my issue addressed, most of the time it’s multiple tickets because they never answer them.

2. Special Projects go ignored. I submitted a request to label, repack and ship to Amazon FBA. It went untouched for 2 MONTHS. When I asked about the status they ignored me and marked it as Resolved.

3. I requested a wholesale order be palletized and shipped. Their website clearly states wholesale orders will be ready to ship within 2 DAYS. It went untouched for 10 DAYS until I followed up with them. Their LTL freight quotes were ridiculous. $492 for 3 pallets to travel 60 miles. I used my own freight forwarder and only paid $350. Do not use their freight forwarder, use your own. Then they charged me $192 to palletize 3 pallets of product! My second wholesale order they charged me $385 to palletize 6 pallets! (Most 3PLs charge $10/pallet.)

4. I created 4 wholesale orders and provided them prepaid UPS labels. They disregarded my instructions and billed me for shipping! I asked to be reimbursed because I provided them with PREPAID LABELS but they flat out said NO. I filed a dispute with my credit card company to get my money back.  For unknown reasons my bank sided with Shipmonk and reimbursed them the funds. Then Shipmonk RE-BILLED ME for the exact same amount! Now they have DOUBLE the money they were never supposed to bill me for in the first place. I asked for a refund of the second charges but they refused. I even showed them the letter from my bank saying they sided with Shipmonk but they claimed they never received the reimbursed funds.

They also charged me $13.50 per carton to slap a label on it and put it out for UPS to pick up. (Most 3PLs charge $5 a carton.)

5. Three times they asked what I would like done with customer returns that were returned to their warehouse. I said ship them back to me but I never received any product.

6. They do not provide photos of customer returns so you cannot verify the customer actually returned the correct product. All you get is an email notification and you are at liberty to refund the customer. They could have returned a counterfeit item or a pile of rocks but you would never know.

7. Don't bother submitting a ticket when a customer package gets lost in transit. They do not respond. You can't even file the claim yourself with the shipper because Shipmonk has all of the shipping information and they will not give it to you.

8. They "lost" 20 cartons of my product and refused to reimburse me for the product cost or the supposed storage fees I was paying on it.

9. Closing my account was a headache and the process took over 5 weeks. TWICE they said they would credit my account if I signed their Closing Agreement which had a very detailed non-disparagement clause, meaning I could not say or post anything negative about them. Obviously they were aware I was upset with their services and were trying to shut me up. Sounds like a bribe! I flat out said NO I am not signing this. I thought my account was closed and then I got hit with their $250 monthly minimum fee on my account! AGAIN they said they would credit me the $250 if I sign their non-disparagement agreement. I said NO again and threatened to hire an attorney and pursue legal action if they didn't close my account immediately. That seemed to do the trick and I am finally done with these clowns.

Working with Shipmonk has been the worst decision I ever made for my business. They will fight you tooth and nail for every single red cent they can get out of you. They NEVER take responsibility for mistakes, it’s always YOUR FAULT. If you are doing wholesale orders, LTL shipping or Amazon FBA then this place is a nightmare to deal with. I do not recommend Shipmonk to anybody who is serious about their e-commerce business or their sanity.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Text>This is my 4th 3PL, and I'm sticking with ShipMonk.  I've been in ecommerce for over 10 years and have used multiple fulfillment houses.   ShipMonk is by far the most responsive.    All warehouses will run into operations issues from time to time - even if you're running your own.  The difference is how well your 3PL responds to issues.  If you need responsive support, ShipMonk is for you.</Text>< pics>

This place is horrible. Reading through the comments I'm asking myself how they even stay in business. Its no wonder all the items go "missing" . Disgruntled workers= stolen items. Its not rocket science.

On top of that overcharging and "happiness engineers" who can't "engineer" their way out of over-billing us.  Time to cut our loses and move on. No matter how much of a "discount" Jan offers it's not enough.

In the long run that "discount" is just another hustle that will end up costing more.</text>

Great company to work for they offer promotions to those who work hard and have ambition ! The leads and supervisors Ricardo and Gunner are very professional as well, always have a positive attitude with all employees, offer great training, and want nothing but great things for Shipmonk. Overall great staff ! You’d have to be a complete immature irresponsible idiot to ever get fired from this company.</Text>

Be warned: would strongly recommend going elsewhere for fulfillment. We were with Shipmonk since their original San Bernardino location and have recently closed our account. The entire warehouse staff has turned over since we started with them and the service has been terrible at best. Shipping delays, improper packaging, misplaced SKU’s, shipping damaged items the list goes on. The warehouse has lost/stolen or damaged many items and has a policy where we have to go out of our way to provide proof of purchase from our suppliers to get any type of reimbursement for their mistakes, it's a huge hassle and a criminal policy. Just complete incompetence from the current warehouse staff. It’s a shame, the original staff i would’ve given a 4-5 star review but it's turned over many times and it's just terribly inconsistent. We’ve closed our account and are now fulfilling elsewhere.< /text>

I have been using Shipmonk to send higher value items. They are consistently late -- like really late on shipping out to my customers. It impacts my brand. I have to tell my customers about Shipmonk, show them the breakdown in their process to save face. The price you are quoted to ship changes after it's shipped. (you can't correctly bill your customers). One recent package worth $1600 didn't have the actual item in the box when it was received by the customer. I insured it. I have tried to get an answer. Tried to get paid back. Shipmonk Claims has dropped the ball 5 times. Claims has been a nightmare. I have over $3000 in unprocessed claims due to shipping issues. Customs handling is terrible. Shipmonk is asleep at the wheel. I can't wait to sell the remaining inventory and find a new vendor for fulfillment.< /review>

This company is so foul, it took them two and a half months to pay me $300.00 that they LEGALLY OWED ME and then fired me when I brought up that fact that the Better Business Bureau was being contacted regarding my payment. I was one of the first workers that moved them to the new Warehouse that they are currently in, they overwork me 16 hours a day for a whole month and REFUSED to pay me for it. Now they are trying to threaten my cousin's employment there if I do not take down my review.
THIS IS NOT RIGHT & SHIPMONK IS NOT A GOOD COMPANY.
THEY NEED TO BE SHUT DOWN.< /review>

We have been working with ShipMonk for over a year and overall they have done a decent job in handling our merchandise. In the beginning we had some hiccups and then things improved as we moved along. They have been quick to create solutions for problems that we have encountered. We use their service mostly to fulfill our wholesale B2B order to major retail companies such as CVS, Walmart, and Target. We continuously send them containers directly from our factory. Outsourcing the work has helped us focus on what matters the most and that is selling.< /text>

< review>
Worst company I have ever worked with. The head of HR Daniel at the San Bernadino warehouse fostered such an enviornment in which I was threatened by Shipmonk employees and had to leave because I no longer felt safe working there.< /review>

Terrible. Absolute nightmare the last few months we were with them. Cost us thousands of dollars in documented direct losses due to numerous shipping mistakes and lost and/or misplaced inventory on orders for just one account alone. We were assessed chargebacks, fees and losses due to inaccurate carton contents, shipments that were short units, shipments that were over units, late shipments and packages that were missing necessary documents.
Numerous emails and calls to them communicating instructions and identifying concerns and issues but they still made repeated mistakes. Repeatedly provided us with inaccurate info regarding shipments and status. Due to inaccurate inventory numbers, we repeatedly asked them to provide us with an inventory report but took them weeks to provide. Extremely unsatisfactory customer service in response to issues<//review>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>Absolutely AWFUL company. At all costs avoid using them for your business! This company has potentially costs us tens of thousands of dollars! We used them for our subscription box and they fell flat on every promise that they made us, delaying our shipments weeks at a time! And they never communicated with us ANYTHING! This picture shows how I have had to hound them down for a response.

With a MONTHLY subscription box, I can't have uncommunicated WEEKS of delay. I've dealt with SO MANY CHARGEBACKS that my bank had to discontinue service with us.

WORST BUSINESS DECISION EVER DECIDING TO WORK WITH THEM, AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE< /Review></record></dataset><record>

The tools and dashboard are very simple and easy to use and make handling your shipping, orders, and inventory very easy and transparent. If you need someone to handle your order fulfillment shipmonk is great for this.< /text>

We've been using Shipmonk (and their associated Shopify app) for more than a year now.

The onboarding process is fairly easy and they help you connect your store to their fulfillment center, and map the SKUs to their internal inventory codes. You can also do it yourself manually if you create product bundles, for instance, or they will do it for you if you have a lot of them, just by sending them a CSV.

From that moment on, Shipmonk automatically captures the orders from Shopify, processes them, and then inserts the tracking number once the order has been fulfilled.

So all in all, it is a very straightforward process and the only work you need to do is check their interface daily to verify no orders are "stuck" because the buyer entered an incorret address, or you have run out of stock of any item (which you shouldn't, as they provide a forecast on how many days of inventory you have left at the current sales rate.

All in all, very satisfied with their service and the timely delivery of the orders to my customers.< /Review>

I just moved in.
Everyone at the front desk was helpful, friendly, and professional. They made the process for me quick and easy. Their response time was super fast for both my emails and calls.
I have nothing wrong to say about my experience with Arbors so far. The environment is clean, quiet, and welcoming.
Alena couldn’t have made this process any easier or faster for me. It was great. Thanks, Alena!
The Arbors is in a beautiful, secure location near both the shopping centers and the freeway.</Text>

I am so stoked on my new rad apartment! Its everything I wanted! I moved into a renovated one bedroom, on May 20th and I couldn't be any happier! I have the hard wood floors I've always wanted! My move in went seamlessly, the office staff welcomed me in from day one. I am so excited to call this place my new home!!

REVISING THIS ON 8/3/19: I still am in LOVE with my apartment. Rent is super easy to pay since they have an online payment option. They are revamping the complex and repainting all the exteriors! They are giving the main pool are make over. I'm so excited to bring my friends to the pool once it's done! Daniel in the leasing office is amazing! I went in to the office today because I was having difficulties with my renters insurance and needed some clarification. He walked me through the entire thing with such patience (because I'm sure I was driving him nuts with my millions of questions). He was so sweet and genuine the entire time. Maintenance is great here too! My AC started to leak just a little from using it so often. I called the office and they had Miguel, the maintenance technician, over to my apartment in less that 5 minutes. He was extremely sweet, patient, and thorough. My AC was fixed in 15 minutes and hasn't leaked since.

I'm just so happy here!< /Text>

<text>I moved in about a month ago and have had a really good experience so far! My screen door was hard to open but the maintenance man came and fixed it within a couple days! Elena at the front office is a sweet heart and was so helpful through out the process! If you have questions, ask for her!<//text>< Pictures>

This place is not safe for vehicles, and the management does not care what happens to you.  We moved here in late December within a month the catalytic converter to our car was stolen.  We reported it to the office hoping they would fix the gate (which has been broken since arrived).  They didn't and one month later it was stolen again.  This happened in our designated parking spot.  We reported it to management and they pretty much responded with a shrug and said it could have happened anywhere. Do not rent here.  Theft is bad and management won't care or take any actions to improve it.  During the filing of our police report, the officer mentioned that they have to come out to the apartments often for similar incidents.  Do not rent here.  It is not safe and management does not care.  Do not rent here.  It is not safe and management does not care.  Do not rent here.  It is not safe and management does not care.  Is it safe? no.  Does management care? no.</review>

I lived here since 2011 and there's been a lot of changes to the building and the whole complex as well as the people too, the building changes were nice its just the people there nowadays who live there are a little rude and quite annoying. As much problems we had with the people here we still enjoyed living here and we watched this old apartment complex grow. We recently moved out because they have been raising the rent quite a bit each year, and it was just this year that they raised it a little too much and we had to move out.<//Review><Rate>3< /Rate><resp>{'time': 1548782236279, 'text': "Hello Dandy,\n\nThank you for your recent review!

<review>I moved in to this complex a year and a half ago. Their office staff is unprofessional, can't even be bothered to answer the phone or process paper work. Taking care of the most basic of maintenance request is non existent. I've had the washer in my unit go unrepaired and leaking all over the floor for over a month. I've had the dryer broken for over a month before they bother to even send a maintenance person to look at it, let alone fix it. I have called and put in countless maintenance requests in their system which just gets marked as completed without the problems being repaired. The buildings are infested with rats including the ventilation system. So if you enjoy breathing in rat excrements or just breathing at all good luck, especially if you have asthma like my roommate does. To top it off, today I come home after working a 16 hour shift in a hot sweaty kitchen. There was no hot running water in my unit, no notification that the hot water was going to be out. I had to call the emergency maintenance number, which they didn't answer like always. Wonder why it even exists. Then I had to proceed to call the main office number which as usual is forwarded to the main call center because no one in the office ever answers the phone. As usual the call center was notified by the leasing office that the hot water would be out but didn't bother notifying the tenants. Long story short, just finished driving an hour round trip to take a shower at my family's home. Don't move here unless you don't need basic daily necessities. They overcharge for rent and still continues to charge their tenants hundreds of dollars for amenities that have been closed the entirety of COVID. Cliche but would give zero stars if I could.< /review>< pictures>

Horrible service. The staff does not care about its renters. I’ve had work orders for months that still aren’t resolved (AC keeps leaking). They towed my wife’s car without any notice because they said it was dirty and had old tags (even though we had the new tags as proof). Avoid this place at all costs.

Addition: note to renter, they will charge for everything in the apartment. Even normal wear and tear doesn’t count.< /text>

Horrible place to live. Apartment always has issues that they aren't willing to fix and one of my main issues is that no aggressive dog breeds are allowed but there have been multiple pitbulls and german shepherds around here. They act like they dont know what's going on but they do considering they allow them to rent the apartments out.<//review>

< Review>
My wife and I were treated terribly at Arbors Cal Oaks. Office staff would complete work orders online, when the issue was not taken care of. Whenever my wife would go to the office to try and resolve an issue, the male gentlemen with glasses would treat her very disrespectfully. Also, whenever we would try to contact the office staff at Cal Oaks, our phone call was always forwarded to the corporate number, who have no clue what's going on at the local sites.

We were left with bees coming through our air vents for a minimum of two weeks before anyone got back to us on what the process would be to getting the issue resolved.

We also had a hole on our balcony for a couple of months where my toddler almost fell down the stairs on numerous occasions.

We received a gate opener for the "gated" community, which were stuck being open for the 2 years we resided there. Not exactly a gated community if the gates are always broken.

The contractors that painted the buildings, didn't take proper precautions and let paint overspray get on our vehicle. Then, their resolution was getting one of their maintenance guys to detail our vehicle rather than getting it professionally detailed...

Besides the terrible office staff, the parking situation is horrific. There isn't enough space for all of the residents there. The laundry facility was never clean and upkept.

I will NEVER recommend this complex to any friends or family. These are NOT luxury apartments.< /Review>

I paid the $400 deposit to hold the apartment. I did not get approved which had the wrong information on there credit check I tried to give them documents and tell them somethings are not on any of the real credit bureaus reports they said they could not help me. Then they said what is an address to send a check for the $400 that I would receive it in 21 days. What a joke the lady in charge is rude. When I asked if I could come to pick up the money she never emailed back.< /Review>

So happy here. I absolutely love my new home! I moved in 3 months ago and I'm still getting adjusted but so far so good. The office ladies have been incredible with helping me move in, the maintenance team helped unclog my garbage disposal after my son dropped his toy into it (sorry!). I used the pool for the first time last week and I had never felt more relaxed. I take walks around the property just for the beautiful scenery. I still cant believe this is my new home.< /review>

I have lived here for almost two months now and I am so happy with my choice to move in. The office staff, specifically Alena, have been so helpful and great! Maintenance is always cleaning grounds in the morning and all work orders have been solved promptly. The location of these apartments is great, walking distance to shopping, dining, & parks. I am so happy with my choice to move here and would recommend it to anyone!</text>

2 months after moving out of the Arbors, this company has continued to ignore our inquiries, and refused to return our deposit.

Think twice about leasing here. I will be notifying the city and county of the Arbor’s illegal business practices.< /Text>

<username>matt m</username><review>Do not apply to this property!  Read their reviews under JRK Properties.  JRK owns these units.  I would never get a place that is owned by them.  They scam people out of their deposits, before they move in. They have a $275.00 member ship fee that's at the end of the contract and a verbal 25.00 added to your rent every month for improvements to the complex.  Arena said the $275.00 is an HOA fee.(Lie) There is no ownership here.  There are so many people who never moved in here and paid a deposit that they are fighting to get back.  Do not Believe the Fake 5star reviews.  This place will be in litigation verysoon.<//review><Rate>1<//Rate>< pictures>

This is the slums of Murrieta. They are scam artist. First they show you only one part of the complex when viewing before renting to you. You supposedly cannot see the unit you are renting until moving in because insurance purposes. We showed up to move in and the unit we signed for looked nothing like the unit they showed us. The bathtubs were nasty and brown in color like they had not been cleaned in a year. The refrigerator was beaten in and 3 different colors, there was no dinning room. I went back to the office and they said they could not give back our deposit because it was nonrefundable,  they showed us another unit that we end up taking. They told us there was on site security and then later sent out an email that do not have security. They advertise that they are gated community 1) there is not gates around the entire property 2) the gates did not work for over 90% of the time that we lived there. They still don't work to this day(I drive by it everyday). Also they claimed they were turning on the utilities in our name which they charged us to do and then you find out the bill is from their main office and not a utility company. They over water the grounds and pay some half hazard grounds keepers that don't clean up anything and then pass those costs on to their tents. We were paying over $160 a month in their fake water bill for a tiny 2 bedroom. I now live in a 3 level 4 bedroom 3 bath townhome less then a mile away and I pay $60 a month in water. Now I found out that they said we owed them money after keeping our deposit, not once did they send a bill, make a phone call or send an email saying we owed them money, now this is on my credit. Arbors you better bet my attorney will be in contact and you will have to prove that you attempted to let us know there was more money owed which you will not be able to do and I will be filing a complaint with the BBB. Run do not walk but run away from these scam artist. I would give them no stars but I can't.  Last the only reason they have over 3 stars is because they bribe their tenants into good reviews by offering free TVs if you put a good review up for them(I still have the proof of these emails). Game on The Arbors.< /Review>

I like that they have a courtesy officer at night for me to call in case of anything. They have someone who also takes care of the ground and picks up trash and cleans up. It's so wonderful here.

<Text>Needed a 6 month lease at a cheap rate because Extended Stay hotels were breaking my budget. I found this place online, and booked an appointment to see an apartment. I went over details with an agent, she made it  extremely easy for me to understand how the process would move along. I am now set to move in April 1st. I've driven by a few times at night. From what I observed there seems to be plenty of available parking at night, the building are well lit and it is almost eerie how quiet it is.  The grounds seem to be kept up. The amenities are pretty cool. I can tell I'm going to get a bunch of use out of the pools. You can't get a better deal anywhere else. I feel like I made out on a deal- I'm one happy camper!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I am very happy living here.< /review>

When we first walked the apartment with Alena the leasing agent she was rude and did not know the basic information of the property. She showed us the apartment I was going to rent which was dirty and not in showing condition. When we received keys and walked the apartment it was filthy and in the bathroom drawer had trash and belongings from previous resident, which she then said she will have housekeeping go and clean it out after they gave us keys. We could not move in until they were done and still apartment was dirty. Within the first week I did laundry and the dryer did not work at all! It would take 5 hours to dry one small load!!!! Maintenance came and “fixed” it and that same day it still took 5 hrs to dry my clothes. They don’t do anything with people dealing drugs, smoking inside the apartments, or taking care of your requests! My dryer still to this day does not work my apartment smells of marijuana and cigarettes and they tell me there is nothing they can do! When I put in my first work order it took them 2 weeks to come out! The office staff is rude and don’t care about their residents! I try and call the office and no one ever answers and I always get directed to their customer service department that does not have anything to do the property directly! I would give them 0 stars if I could! Sadly I only moved here in an a emergency of providing housing for my family.< /Text>

<Text>Worst experience ever DO NOT RENT HERE.
Parking is HORRIBLE. The service there is absolutely disgusting. We were promised a lot of the new renovations that the showing apartments have. Moved in to our apartment and nothing was like the showings. We were told we would have a patio. We don’t have one. Only thing good here is the maintenance people because they are super nice and always on time. Only reason I’m giving a one star. If not it would be no star at all. This place just tries to get money out of you. We have parking permit stickers, which we pay $20 every month but for what?!? They don’t keep up with that. So basically just paying them $20 monthly for absolutely no reason. They state there’s security there, when a whole year of living here, not once have I seen security. There is a whole bunch of skunks, possum and raccoons here. New thing they started, we have to buy our own lightbulbs, (not a big deal), but the fact that in our utilities bill we are already paying a maintenance fee. Also when we moved into our apartment, there was stains on the carpet, the blinds had Bite marks, the bathroom sink had stains. All in all, I’m Glad to say that my lease is finally over in August.<//Text>< pics>

<review>Take pictures of everything during your move in & move out process. My son & his girlfriend rented a unit from them. Last June they moved out. They left the unit immaculate!! The assistant manager, Krystal, said everything looked great. However, they managed to sneak in some fees that were questionable. My son & his girlfriend are still trying to get a $50 paint fee back that the manager promised to refund them. It's been 8 months! They've left messages for the manager & corporate.

<Text>So happy here. I absolutely love my new home! I moved in 3 months ago and I'm still getting adjusted but so far so good. The office ladies have been incredible with helping me move in, the maintenance team helped unclog my garbage disposal after my son dropped his toy into it (sorry!). I used the pool for the first time last week and I had never felt more relaxed. I take walks around the property just for the beautiful scenery. I still cant believe this is my new home.< /Text>< time>

I am absolutely in awe with the customer service I experienced with Brandi at the leasing office. To have someone go so far above and beyond to make us feel comfortable was so special. Brandi had such amazing communication with us and was so fast to respond. I have never had such a positive experience. The Arbors grounds are beautiful. They are so clean and well kept. Plus the pools in the warm weather were wxactually what we needed! Thank you Brandi for your kindness and thank you Arbors for an awesome stay!!!</review>

We found The Arbors through craigslist. At first we were skeptical because they were advertising a lower price than all the other complexes in the area. We thought we would call and inquire before making the trip from La Jolla. We spoke with Daniel and he confirmed pricing with us and we scheduled a tour for the upcoming Saturday. Fast forward to Saturday, we show up to our appointment, we meet with Daniel and he shows us a model apartment for the floor plan we were interested in. Of course the model always look immaculate and decorated like the inside of a furniture magazine. We weren't sold yet, it all seemed too good to be true. We asked if he had a vacant apartment that was in showing condition and by coincidence he did! When we finally got to view the final product. We were just as impressed with the vacant apartment than we were with the model apartment. After talking some numbers over with our leasing agent, we decided to take the jump and apply! ANDDDDDDDDD we could not be any happier! We were approved and sent move in costs the very next day and even got to move in the upcoming week. We have been here for about a month so far and it's been smooth sailing. My apartment had new vinyl wood floors and brand new appliances as part of the renovations they are doing. My fiance and I have opted for the one bedroom to save some money and work towards a house in the future. The one bedroom is cozy and such a perfect size for a couple. As far as the overall community of the complex it has all been great as well! The grounds are always picked up and the pools are actually taken care of really well here when compared to other complexes I had toured in the past. The gym is awesome and they have some really good machines available. Oh! and its open 24/7- great for my fiance who has such a  tricky work schedule. Maintenance has been in my apartment a couple times to fix little things here and there and they have all been wonderful too, very courteous and respectful while in my apartment. Overall, I recommend The Arbors and I've even referred a few of my friends and family to the complex. If you're not certain because of all the reviews (yes I read the reviews before I toured!) then go check the place out for yourself and take a tour. I pretty much interrogated Daniel (LOL) with all my questions or concerns (because of the reviews!) and he honestly took my questions like a champ and made me feel good about my decision to apply. If the Arbors team even reads these reviews then thank you to Daniel and the entire team who helped me and my fiance get in so quickly! If anyone has any questions about the complex then just let me know and I would be happy to answer, I'm really happy here!</Review></record></dataset><record>
<Review>Worst apartment to stay at. I wouldn't even rate it one star, this place gets no stars. My roommate and I moved in due to work. We kept everything looking brand new moving in and moving out. We talked and informed the office that our work is relocating us and if they could work with us. They said yes or course. Sense they were going to do that we were nice enough to vacuum and steam clean the carpets before we officially moved out, so they could rent the apartment out as soon as possible. That was a big mistake definitely DID NOT work with us.

Management and maintenance are horrible with the tenets, lazy, never fixes anything, just the worst and unprofessional place ever.

We regret ever moving in and trying to work an arrangement with them.<//Review>< Date>

I know I see a lot of negative reviews about this place and I find it funny because the reviews are all about the people who live here, not the apartments or the staff themselves! These are the most affordable apartments in town, they’re fairly clean and in good condition. The amenities are great and always clean. The girls at the office are nice and make me feel welcome :) I just renewed my
Lease!</Text>

<Review>I'm a past resident of The Arbors. I lived for few a couple of years (2016-2018) and I'm regretting EVER leaving. Since I had gotten married, my husband decided he wanted a bigger apartment at another complex. This was the BIGGEST mistake. We moved out of my cozy cute one bedroom at The Arbors and moved into another complex in Temecula. This move has caused so much stress and turmoil on my life. The Arbors felt like home and I'm disappointed I ever left.
I miss:
Walking my dog around the beautiful green property, having Target right across the street from me, being so close to the 15 and 215 freeways (literally 5 minutes away), the friendly staff always greeting me through out the property,  hanging at the pools in the summer time with my friends and family, using the 24/7 fitness center,  my cheap utility bills, running across the street to Barons for a fresh salad, and overall the peace and quiet of the apartment complex. I can not wait for my current lease to be over where I'm at now just so I can re apply at The Arbors. I'm never letting my husband talk me into such a stupid decision again.

#Brandi

I have lived in the Arbors for over a year now. I think I’m in the quietest part of the complex. I ended up having a leak with the rain, after a couple attempts to correct the problem. Brandi has truly corrected and fixed the problem! Thank you! Remember it is a large apartment complex, patience is key! Also.... you get more with honey than you do with vinegar! Thanks again Brandi!<//Review>

<Time>1557798379274<//Time><rate>1</rate><review>We stayed at the Arbors for a year. Parking is HORRIBLE. There’s hardly ever any available parking. We had moved in at the beginning of May and the heat wave was just getting started. We had sent MANY requests for maintenance to fix the AC in our apartment and every time it would still continue to blast out hot air from outside. We ended up frying all summer long. They over charge everything. How does trash go up month by month higher and higher??? Utilities charges were a joke. When we left after the year contract was up, rent went up by $300. Not worth any of it!! Go save yourself money and put the money towards a house. When we left, we rented the carpet cleaner and vacuum to clean twice. Inspection came around and we were told we didn’t clean our carpet, I even gave them a receipt. We waited to get our refund back and was told it would come with a receipt/invoice of what was charged. NOPE. They just took more than have of our deposit from us without explanation. We will have to go find out why we were charged for what we were charged. Last time we spoke to someone in the office we were told our last payment was final with utilities, but the moment we turned in our keys, they said we had to pay for the last 3 days or so for the month. How could utilities cost up to $100+ for 3 days?? Anyways, I digress. Don’t live here, they’ll rob you of all your money.< /review>< Pics>

Disgustingly horrendous apartment complex, in every way you can think of. Please check YELP. I've reviewed them in detail there and you can view other's reviews also and see that any decent human being despises this place. NEVER rent from here. Seriously. Even if you were literally going to be homeless you should still not take the decision lightly. Your local YMCA or homeless shelter is likely better maintained and carsc about their residents more than this dump.

Also, to whomever is reading this. This review is not written as a knee jerk reaction to something that happened to me recently. I stayed here 3-4 years ago. But they've left such a nasty impression on me and I hate this place so much I'm willing to write a bad review again years later just to spite The Arbors. Not to mention they ruined my near perfect credit. Extremely dishonest immoral company.

P.S. oh, and in case you're wondering why there are good reviews here on Google it's because they literally bribed people to leave good reviews with the chance of winning a flat screen TV. If you check the YELP reviews there is proof of this there.< /Text>

I like it here a lot. The office people are pretty cool. Don't got much complaints. The jacuzzi brings my peeps around. Fitness center is usually empty, so I cancelled my LA Fitness membership and work out here now. I even run around the tennis court for some cardio. And you can't really beat this location... or the price. These apartments are cheap but they don't look cheap. My apartment was taken care of all the appliances look great and I got a washer and dryer with the place. I plan on being here a while.< /review>

I just moved back and I couldn't have made a better choice! Being super realistic, I am super tight on income and I was living in a literal dump before. The Arbors can accommodate middle America and I feel like some of the reviews are not exactly true. 2nd timer here and I have NO complaints.</review>

Let me make it clear they owed ME money after my move out but said I lived there for an extra week that I did not. I moved out, turned in my keys and moved on to my new residence. Months later I’m commuting to work and get a call from a collections agency explaining I owe $900 - this collection company is literally bottom of the barrel gutter trolls who will literally threaten you to get you to pay money you don’t owe. I attempted 3 separate times to get in touch with the office and the staff. I went in personally and insisted they help me with the issue each time they promised it was being taken care of. I should have been more persistent. I work 50 hour work weeks so going into this place was becoming a chore. The “collection” I came later to find the complex admitted they made a mistake and in fact owed me $80 after move out and they told me they “emailed” corporate and it would be corrected. Weeks went by once again at this point I had a derogatory mark on my credit file which means if I want to rent again I will be denied. I had to pay it in the end to prevent any negative impact to my credit.

Long story short this place will literally RUIN your credit steal your money and get away with it. On top of that it’s old a run down something a new coat of paint can’t hide, roaches, drug deals constantly happening on the premises, murrieta PD is there raiding apartments every week. There are many other complexes in town with a better living experience.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dc825a513a9497:0x761b6a1e2e61176c</gmap_id></record>

I applied for an apartment after being shown the model apartment and some of the amenities. They only show you things that are in the front of the property, the only portion of this complex they manage to clean. I spent almost $400 and was told that the “membership fee” was refundable if I wasn’t going to move in, otherwise I never would have spent this exorbitant amount. I applied and came in a week later and decided to drive around the property myself. The trashes everywhere were overflowing, there was garbage on the ground in front of apartments, and it smelled like skunk and cigarette smoke everywhere, especially towards the back of the property. There were residents smoking on their balcony even though they have a policy that you aren’t supposed to smoke in the units, nothing was being done to prevent this. I asked one of the leasing agents, Daniel, if I could see what an available unit looks like. He gave my boyfriend and I his keys to walk ourselves there. Keep in mind he told me this was a FINISHED unit, ready for move in. I went in and was SHOCKED. It looked absolutely NOTHING like the model, the flooring was not the same, the ceiling was literally sagging, which is 100% a safety hazard. Cabinets were broken, it was dirty, the mirror was discolored and chipping, and the light fixtures were rusty. At this point I was not sure I wanted to live here anymore. I asked Daniel if things like this are repaired before move in, and he kept changing the subject and not answering my question. He told me that he didn’t know what I was talking about when I described the issues in the unit, which is 100% a lie, as any rational person would notice all of those problems and be extremely unhappy if that’s what they’d have to live with. I decided I no longer wanted to live in this complex, and asked him about the refund, and he changed his tone instantly, immediately interrupted me, told me it was “too late” and I can wait and see once I move into the apartment. How is it “too late”? I NEVER signed anything saying I will be living in this complex, and only a week had passed. What in the world is this “membership fee” for when I’m not even a member of this apartment complex??? He acted as though I was going to sign things to bind myself to this place without any of my questions answered or issues resolved. The entire time we were having this discussion, one of the female employees also in the office was smiling and making snarky facial expressions. I really wish I had read the Yelp reviews before even going to this place, because they are definitely all true! These people know their complex has massive issues, and they want to make money, that’s why they show you a model that looks nothing like the apartments you’ll actually live in so they can scam money out of you when you change your mind! PLEASE look elsewhere for apartments, as there are so many beautiful ones in Temecula/Murrieta that are less expensive, and much more professional. I’m so disgusted with this entire experience and the incredibly rude employees, I have never experienced something this awful, and I have visited numerous apartments in this area.<//text>

Love the location of these apartments. They aren't right off the street  so it makes it feel private and cozy. The new manager Brandie is so great and hands on with the residents and the girls in the office are super friendly. They even had a taco night for the residents a few weeks ago!  All of the units have been newly remodeled and they are now offering vinyl wood flooring as an upgradde<//review>

<Review>Just moved out after having a work order from MAY not completed for my refrigerator door. I gave birth & had surgery & called in between each major life event for updates (waiting on part was their answer) and could not take the frustration of having to call for updates (along with other housing frustrations) anymore.  I called their corporate office for escalated assistance & was left with " MAILBOX FULL" message.  Emailed JRK Property Holding, (the investment firm for this company) to share my concerns & no call or reply! This Apartment complex has no upper management to hold anyone in the office accountable!
1. Not enough parking to support tenant occupancy, EVER
2. Spider & ant infestation- Was bitten 4 months pregnant, & so has everyone of my visitors
3. Old carpets, fell apart in several areas & corners while vacuuming, & lifts from floor - ALLERGY FILLED!- Office manager told me the date of the carpet is underneath the carpet because I was concerned about the health & well being of my husband worsened allergies.
4. Weak electrical work- dead outlets, new light bulbs constantly burn out, dinning fan light flickers- could not fix
5. STRUCTURALLY UNSAFE- Uneven floors where you can feel tiles shifting that are underneath the carpet between the kitchen & living room- HUGE CONCERN since there is people below us! I felt my heart drop every time I heard the floor click fearing anyone can fall through.
Brandi the office manager was could not call me to address my concerns professionally instead emailed me 3 days after I had delivered a letter in person.  For "training purposes" they listed my phone records which was grossly inaccurate & claimed I never notified them of a majority of my concerns listed... EXCEPT maintenance made repairs on majority of them (AC, electrical, plumbing, pest control) so she called me a lair, essentially. The office team lacked empathy whenever I expressed a real concern, & Proved to fail in property management & record keeping.

It appears this company Cares more about the Property Grounds then the safety & structure of their apartment unit!!
They start asking for reviews 1 month after move in & send you a reminder every month, so any positive reviews are from tenants who have yet to have a have a problem, concern, or need from management. Spend your hard earned money somewhere else!!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<text>I love this place. Moved in not too long ago and everything has been smooth sailing from the get go.

I've had one maintenance request for the smoke detector and the maintenance man was here within 2 hours.

The pools are clean and well kept, the landscaping is lovely, the complex is quiet and well kept. It's also located near A LOT of shopping and dining. It's been a really great place to live and I hope to stay here quite a while.

I'd recommend The Arbors to anyone and everyone who's looking for a peaceful, well taken care of complex to call home.<//text>< pictures>

< review>
This is my first place and by far has been absolutely horrible.

I work during the office hours and when I call for anything: maintenance, wanting a garage, or any questions at all...they never answer and a off site office answers who's only job is to email the leasing office informing them of the call. I've called 8+ times. All of which get forwarded and I never receive a call back like I request. Even to add a garage.

Maintenance takes forever. emergencies took 3-5 days to fix. there should be week round maintenance. if my apartment that im paying for is having issues out of my control, I don't want to wait 72 hours. and based off the size of the complex. it shouldn't take that long. and since it does, you can assume that they have non stop maintenance issues.

rent is never pulled within a reasonable time. they provide an app to add connivence but it takes the app anywhere from 3-6 days to pull out the funds.

apartment was no where near the show apartment. I wasn’t able to see it because the last tenant was still living there. and when I finally got into my apartment, it smelled like there was 5000 cats living there. and im very allergic to cats so I had to spend the first night in my very first apartment sleeping in my car. and the following night at a friends until the apartment aired out.

every other tenant I've spoken to, hates this place. not a single person who makes average amount of money likes it here. if I was making a lot more money, id be less irritated but being that I live on a budget, this place is killing me.

there is animals everywhere here. I have smelled skunks every morning for the past 7 months here. I almost got bitten one night when I was walking to my apartment (it was dark at the time and the building lights weren't even on. another issue) and I walked to close to an animal I couldn't even see and almost got bit.

they repainted the buildings and did a horrible job.

THEY ARE A TOTAL SCAM. AND ONCE YOU SIGNED THE LEASE. THEY TREAT YOU LIKE TRASH. I AM A TOTALY CALM PERSON AND EVERYTIME I HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE OFFICE, I LEAVE WANTING TO DO SOME UNGODLY THINGS TO THEM.

AND TO THE MANAGMENT...THIS ISNT GERMANY HITLER, IF YOU DONT SEE HOW MUCH EVERYONE HATES IT HERE AND MAKE EFFORTS TO SOLVE THE ISSUE. ILL BE SURE TO START KNOCKING ON DOORS TO GET A NEW STAFF AND ALL POLICIES AND RULES HERE RE-EVALUATED</review>

So far, so good.  I've been living here about 2 months now and this apartment complex has been pretty good.  I've only had one maintenance request that I've submitted so far and they were very prompt to get it fixed.  It's a good location with easy freeway access, I haven't had any issues with my neighbors and it's been pretty quiet which, as far as it goes for apartments, is exactly what I'm looking for!</Text>

Reading these reviews doesn’t feel fair. I understand everyone has different experiences and it takes one negative experience to lash out and leave a nasty review. Most of the reviews I’m reading are because of dumb choices “I parked on a red curb so my car was towed” would you park on a red curb anywhere in else expecting to get away with it?
I’ve lived here for 3 years and I can honestly say I love it. The office staff has ALWAYS helped me and treated me kindly. My neighbors aren’t so bad (keep to themselves and respect the communities “quiet hours”). I play by the rules, pay my rent on time, respect everyone around me. I DON’T park on red curbs so my car has never been towed. Maintenance is a huge help, I’ve had them in my apt for minor things through out my stay and they always get the job done. I’ve never experienced a pest issue here and can’t speak for others but I do maintain my apartment and I’m pretty cleanly. The office girls are sweet and so kind to me whenever I’m in the office. I honestly don’t know where the negative reviews are coming from concerning the staff (y’all must have been at a different office because these clearly aren’t the same ladies your bashing). Maintenace is on it and I’ve RARELY had to wait longer than 1 day to have my work orders completed. The property itself is beautiful and full of nature. My quality of life has been amazing here.
What I hope you take from this review is everyone has different experience based on choices THEY'VE made. Mine has been a very pleasant one here. I would recommend The Arbors to anyone looking for an inexpensive but still tasteful and decently sized apartment. You honestly can’t beat their prices.<//review>

Love this area and apartment, especially the staff! Since day 1 Alena, maintenance men, and the rest of the staff has been nothing but friendly and helpful! They do such a beautiful job at keeping the area clean and always see them working so hard, would highly recommend this area/apartment for anyone!!</Text>

<Review>I got a bad impression of the staff at this place right away. I went in to check out the apartments recently. When I walked in, the staff just looked at me and didn't say anything, no smile, greeting, "we'll be with you shortly," no acknowledgment of me being there at all, just left me standing there. Then a female staff, Hispanic, with light-ish hair came out and "helped" me, with attitude the whole time, saying that they were all too busy to show me anything. She didn't offer to schedule me for a later time, or another day, or anything. She didn't seem like she wanted to tell me about the apartment availability, keeping her interaction very minimal. I had been looking at apartments around the area that day, and all of the other apartment complexes in the area had nice, helpful staff. The staff at this apartment complex needs some customer service training.< /Review><Rate>1< /Rate></record>

This is a copy of the review I posted through the company website although I had to shorten it due to the limits set by Google.

Miguel is the only qualified person to be found on site and addresses service requests with ease.

Unfortunately, this was only in instances where my request was actually responded to and not automatically being closed out when I submitted the request. Speaking of responses: service requests, issues or concerns I had submitted both in Entrata and Email, as well as any correspondence regarding community policies or notices both prior to my tenancy, during my lease period, and in the process of leaving this dump has been minimal (at best, if ever a response is given by management which, should be noted, is rare!!!). On move in day, I asked about the laundry situation after no one answered or responded to my calls prior to move in day, and was told the laundry was 24hours, I was provided a map to find the laundry room. The not so funny part is the assistant manager watched the leasing agent fail to mention the laundry was card operated and the laundry card was ONLY available for purchase or reload in the office, during regular business hours, which are completely unpredictable! I only found this out when I requested service in my apartment (I believe for a shower rod which I ultimately repaired myself) and asked that a laundry card be left when the technician came by and the service unrelated to the laundry situation was never even addressed, I received a response about the laundry card and my request was closed!

When I have entered the office to submit a payment, I have not been greeted and I was not even acknowledged until I was awkwardly looking around the lobby wondering which of the 2 leasing agents or assistant manager was gonna take my money, or if anyone has even noticed I was in the office! The landlord of my new home actually stated that the customer service from the Arbors leasing and management was extremely poor during her verification, a complete stranger could assert that just from dealing with the Arbors staff on a professional basis!

Unfortunately, with all the money being paid, not one person can be paid to pick up the trash left around the dumpsters from homeless people who are camped around the property and the animals who can’t help but be attracted to the smell of the rotten trash that gets disposed of, maybe 2x a week (nowhere near enough for a property this size generating this much garbage!) I’m still seeing the same garbage outside that’s in pictures on Yelp from years ago.

Murrieta is far too beautiful a city to have an apartment community renting filthy, severely neglected homes as what I walked into September 26, 2018. The baseboards were filthy, there was soot and dust on every cabinet and counter top as well as the toilet and shower looking like drug people had been living here until the minute I walked through the door! I had to clean every surface, including the walls before I could unpack anything. I wiped the inside of every cabinet and drawer as nothing looked like it was touched by anything other than an ant or cockroach. No matter how immaculate or how much bleach I used, the bugs literally ever stopped coming. I have had to treat my apartment on so many occasions, and the roaches just kept having babies. I’m extremely concerned by the amount of chemicals I’ve had to use to clean every last crumb as soon as it falls and there still roaches coming through the walls in the bathroom. Whoever has been living here has brought one actual hell of an infestation. I’m writing this review as I’m listening to the flutter of a roach across my floor and I can hear one neighbor telling another outside that they can’t wait to get out of here as soon as possible!</review>

<Text>They're doing all kinds up upgrades. But instead of everything for looks. They need to get a laundry card machine in the laundry room that people can access when their laundry card runs out of money. Instead of only being in the office, coming home from work and they left early so theres no access to the laundry card machine.<//Text>< Name>

One particular employee of The Arbors apartment was such a big help in helping me find a new home. She made us feel welcomed and walked us through a couple apartments and told us what we needed and how everything worked. I loved it and im happy to say i will be a resident real soon!</Review>

<review>BIG Deposit Rip Off Scheme! Potential renters beware! They removed my last post on google! This is FRAUD! Girls in management office being told by corporate office in LA to "approve" most renters. They take HUGE deposits- upwards to $450-$500! They tell you that "you're approved" and the deposit money goes towards move in expenses.  Then, they ignore phone calls and after date passes to return deposit, they change and increase the financial terms of move in! Asking for several hundred more than previously agreed upon! When renters can not come up with the extra cash- they illegally KEEP the initial deposit!< /review>< GmapID>

The first an obnoxious and loud couple that would watch us come in and out of our apartment, and now a middle-aged cocaine addict and dealer, that is up dealing, singing, and yelling at all times of the night! Oh yeah and The Arbors also have two pools!!< /Text>< Pics>

Woefully irresponsible staff and management.  We have had a hive of insects in front of our apartment for more than a month. Management refuses to remove it in a timely manner and give only excuses. Legal action pending. If you are looking for a place to live...move on!< /text>

<Text>I do not know where the 9 '5 Star' reviews were living, but it definitely wasn't at the The Arbors at Cal Oaks.  I was going to leave a review on yelp, but it seems that most other people have done the work for me since these apartments are correctly rated at 1 star on that website.  I am currently living and can't wait till my lease is up.

The management here is terrible, I honestly don't know what the people in the front office do, honestly, beyond show new victims the model apartment.  My roommate and I had to put in 6 repair requests for them to just fix the light outside our front door, it took them 5 months.  The washing machine ruined a load of whites and recently a couple of colored dress shirts.  They came out with spotted grease marks and the people they have sent out to fix it just tell us that they see nothing wrong.  Our dishwasher currently floods our kitchen every time it's run.  My roommate and I have put in 4 repair requests each to have that fixed.  It's still broken and we have yet to have anyone out to fix it.

Those are only the main issues we have had.  Had a friend cut his foot while in the jacuzzi from broken glass.  They didn't deliver on the property upgrades the promised and used to entice my roommate and I to move in.  Plain and simple, there are about a million better places to live than here.  I truly hope this keeps people from moving in.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80dc825a513a9497:0x761b6a1e2e61176c</gmap_id>< user_name>

Maintenance for anything that is wrong with the apartment is utterly terrible and If you put a request in, it usually ends up happening within hours from the time you set for the request, or the next day.
I know there are some people who are looking for an affordable place in Murrieta, but if you really are concerned about how much you make, go for another complex.
I had a simple issue with my kitchen and A/C, which has known to be prominent in the Arbors.
I suggest anyone moving to this place reconsider other options highly.
I hope you make a right choice.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I wish I could give this place HALF A STAR! DO NOT MOVE HERE!
"Luxury apartments" ... yeah right this place is Ghetto asf.
Gates hardly ever work,  BBQ's don't work, fire pits don't work,  there are skunks everywhere, the trash cans are always overflowing, the on-site laundry room is a joke, the pool's are dirty almost every time I go, they take forever to respond to maintenance issues, there are ants and spiders all over the apartments that the management does nothing about, and last but definitely not least THERE IS NEVER ANY PARKING. Good luck finding a parking spot past 5:00pm you are either forced to park across the street or in a fire lane with the inherent risk of getting towed which has happened to numerous people in this complex including myself. Please do your self a favor and DO NOT MOVE IN HERE!<//Text>< user_name>

The communication at this place is terrible. They owe me a refund of $300 and I was supposed to get it a month ago. Since then I have emailed, called, texted, and I haven’t even gotten so much as a response. Do not deal with them if you want actual service and not scams.<//review>

If i could give a zero start rating, I would.. Apartments are infested with ants and cock roaches, maintenance team fixes broken old equipment with more broken old equipment, lack even the slightest amount of care for their tenants, I moved out of these apartments on 2/1/2017, it is now 4/1/2017 and i still have not received my security deposit, despite them telling me multiple times that i would receive it in the mail within 21 business days, i have called the apartments office directly 3 times now and they have taken my phone number and assured me a manager would call me back.. crickets.. they have given me their corporate number where you get a nice voice mail every single time saying you've reached the "JRK department of tenant relations", they ask for your name phone number apartment name, apartment number and they will call you back, literally 20 messages left with corporate and not a single call back, i even left messages until the box was full, still not a single call back.. this apartment complex is managed very poorly, and i would never recommend anyone to live there.<//Text>

<Review>This is the cheapest place to rent in Murrieta. It’s not too bad but when you move out be prepared to get screwed. Don’t think you are going to get security deposit and if you don’t tell them you are vacating the premesis in 60 days they will charge you for an extra month of rent. Check all the horror stories on Yelp if you don’t believe me.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

< Review>
I have only been here a week, but it seems nice so far.  You are paying what you get for guys, they are some of the cheapest apartments in town and I've never experienced loud or crazy neighbors. The walls are thin so yes you do hear a thump here or there, but I can't hear people talking.. When I moved in my apartment was prefectly ready to go other than a small patch of carpet that was clearly replaced and different which was documented.  The reason for 4 stars is all of the junk I have seen out front of neighbors houses and the lights that are so bright all night and I have to cover my windows as much as possible to get some sleep, but again you get what you pay for like I said.  Everyone seems friendly and my place is cozy and seems safe no problems so far.<//Review>

<time>1423703638946<//time><rating>1<//rating><Review>My husband and I, along with our two young children foolishly lived in these apartments for nearly 2 years, from July 2012 until late June 2014.  We only did so because we were trying to save money to buy a house, and ended up moving back in with my husband's parents.  Yeah, it was THAT BAD.  To start, initially there was dog poop.  EVERYWHERE.  Pet friendly?  More like we don't give a crap about crap.  Seriously.  Then ants, everywhere.  I cleaned constantly and tried everything.  They were still everywhere.  Of course, management did nothing, claiming they sprayed for bugs and what not.  Whatever.  Then was the mold.  Initially when we moved in, we thought it was fine, because they painted over it!  I did my best, bleaching it and cleaning it to no avail.  If you are not a smoker or are not into drugs, this is not the place for you.  Even with our windows closed and AC off cigarette smoke still permeated into our apartment through the pathetic walls.  My husband and I and our son all have asthma.  Management didn't care.  They said there was nothing they could do.  Speaking of the pathetic walls, you can hear people having sex through them.  Wow, isn't that great? NOT!  In addition, the community is very unsafe.  I don't care how much they say its improved.  Instead of trying to keep bad people out, how about kick the bad people out?  We were literally surrounded by drug lords.  No matter how much we reported them to management, and even though the police were constantly coming to arrest people in those apartments, management did nothing.  Apparently they care more about money than the safety of their residents.  The security guards are useless.  I tried calling them multiple times when our neighbors were high on drugs and damaging items we had on our porch or just being loud until 3 or 4 am in the morning.  They never came.  Most of the time the pool was broken as well as the workout room.  Our dishwasher was covered in rust and they said it was "fine" and didn't need to be replaced.  We constantly found condoms in the pools along with cum and pubic hair.  Whoever wrote a good review on here must have been paid to.  I know too many people that used to live there and they all say the same thing, GET OUT ASAP.  Please, they are cheaper than other apartments for a reason.  Don't sacrifice your safety and sanity.  Live with your parents or in a homeless shelter before you go here.  Don't waste your time and money!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

The WORST place to live. Management is completely unprofessional. If you have any concerns or issues don't bother in trying to bring it up to their attention they DON'T CARE no matter how many calls you make,  emails you send, office visits you pay, addendums you sign (42pgs. FYI), or promises they make in the beginning they never respond to your messages or emails. The grounds, gym, and pools are never kept up they are DIRTY, and their is feces from people's pets every where. If your apartment needs maintenance you'll be waiting a long time. It's not a gated community because the gates never work so their always open. They have an infestation of ants, spiders, and SKUNKS!  SERIOUSLY don't ever leave your windows open at night even if your trying to conserve energy from using the AC.  If safety is a concern in the managements words " you CAN call the police".  Their "security" is a kind, but grungy man that will show up to your door in a dirty T- shirt, beat up cargo shorts, and sandals with no solution and that's only if he's in town and available. If some one parks in your spot the Tow never shows up and your lucky if you find an open space to park your vehicle.  Their is an excuse for everything; according to management.  I'm not exaggerating,  I just want to warn people before they get stuck in a horrible situation for a year the way we did.

Warning!!! NOW THEIR TRYING TO BRIVE TENANTS WITH A NEW TV RAFFLE LOL FOR THEIR POSITIVE REVIEWS!!!! Their getting so many negative reviews their trying to brive for good ones. It's so bad I literally see a moving truck with people packing in their belongings every other day. That's a huge turn around on tenants.<//Review>

Pretty sure this is my FIRST ever review on anywhere. My husband and I moved in to this place thinking it was so cool, and such an awesome price. We were totally wrong and our first apartment experience was miserable, we even moved in with my parents because we couldn't handle it anymore.

When you go there they preach to you how they have no drug, no drinking policies, they tell you that you are only allowed one covered parking spot, they explain to you the safety they provide and how luxurious it is.

Well, we were there for a year, about 7 months out of that year the gates remained OPEN. No point in even having a gate code. The family above us had at least 5/6 people living there (they told us that you are only allowed a certain amount of people living in your apartment) which this family owned at least 4/5 cars I couldn't keep up.. at times they would park 3 of their cars in covered parking spaces. BS! Someone above us smoked weed at least twice a day and the smell would linger into our apartment every time. I even found a bag of weed in the parking lot. People always drinking at the pool. The dumpsters were always trashed and disgusting. Our apartment always had roaches, and ants which I had to get rid of myself, everyday there was a new bug, our a/c went out, our garbage disposal and even our toilet leaked at one point. OH yeah the parking spot they give you? it's usually on the complete opposite of your building.

We got a notice that they were raising the rent (yeah NO way were we gonna pay more for somewhere we weren't content with) so we gave the 60 day notice as required.. we kept getting notices that they didn't receive a 60 day notice blabla, so I kept a copy and went to speak with the same girl who we gave our notice too and she said "Oh the manager must of lost it, let me make another copy..." REALLY? so got that squared away we moved out, and it was refreshing.

I was just waiting for the balance we owed in the mail to the forwarding address I gave the girl, she explained it would be mailed. Well TODAY I receive a call from some company saying I had an unpaid balance with the arbors of $264 (I literally only owed maybe 70-80 bucks for utilities) they told me that my balance was mailed to me and that's why they called cause I never paid it. WHAT I never RECIEVED IT? So I question it of course, she said it was for damages and the utilities. I was furious, because I never got a report, letter, or even a call regarding this which they should follow up on themselves. I was in TEARS I work hard and so does my husband for our money and I just had to pay for something I didn't understand cause I didn't receive anything regarding it and I didn't want my credit to get hurt by this.

My husband goes down there to talk to them and they said the charges were for utilities, and for damages like carpet cleaning etc. They even said I didn't turn in my remote for the stupid gate that never works anyways, which I DID FREAKING TURN IT IN. but whatever, we paid for it because I do not want to deal with this place ever again. Not sure if anyone will read this review, but I really hope you save your hard earned money and take it elsewhere because how they handled this all was so unprofessional to me. OH yeah and my husband still gets calls from their "front gate" which means he's still in the system and we haven't been living there for a month so someones just trying to get in the gate by calling his phone. SO SAFE.</text>

The air conditioner went out it took  12 calls a day for (4 days) and begging, threatening, asking. It was 102 degrees  INSIDE the apt on the hottest days. Then they show up with a tiny window swamp cooler that ONLY cooled the bedroom, and it took them 2weeks to remove it after the ac was fixed. MAGGOTS were running loose on the ceiling and it too almost 2 months to send the exterminator. The chicks in the office need to go to school and learn how to run an apt office. THIS PLACE IS GHETTO!!!!< /Text>

In every apartment complex there are positives and negatives. People who only see the negative are too self centered and are occasional contributors to the negative. As a former employee, fixing the negatives into positives was my job. I was the gentleman who carried the bucket, picking up trash, cleaning out the dumpsters and cleaned the pools. I can assure you that the MAINT team work hard, day in, day out. They never stop giving their 100. The office crew have so much on their hamds, it's hard to believe the outstanding job they do each day. These ladies are hardworking and very helpful to their clients.
I ask all future residents to be patient and have a open mind. This complex is located at the most convenient spot one could ever ask for. With in a 3 mile radius, you have nearly everything you can ask for.
As a resident, I had an outstanding experience. My cutie and I started off our lives together in a 1 bdrm, Aspen model. Very cozy and heartwarming. Shout out to Alena♡ for being our leasing agent. lol. We had to leave due to my military duties overseas, but returning to The Arbors is a big and huge maybe.
Trust me, with patience and a open mind, you will have a lovely stay. If you see anything negative, don't complain. Notify the office and the MAINT will be there to assess the issue. In other words, help us help you. Simple as that☆

<text>LONG POST BUT WORTH IT
I was going to give this place a 3/5 at first but the last few months I lived there were awful. Truly awful.  After a month of trying to get the renewal offer before we had to turn in a moving notice, and being told "we'll have it next week" 4 times, I finally got an offer of $1,220, 3 days before we had to give notice for our shoebox sized unit. Then the NIGHT before (seriously, at 8:30pm) there was the "real official offer" taped to my door for $1,280. No thanks.
Now after being moved out for over a month, our deduction statement and remainder of our deposit are nowhere to be seen. Under law, we are supposed to get it within 21 days. After numerous unanswered emails, I call the office and the manager told me she called my husband, correctly read his number to me, and claimed she left a voicemail the day prior. Hard to do that when he doesn't have a voicemail set up. When I tell her this fact, she's obviously displeased and doesn't offer an explanation. We may be taking this to court.
The thing is, if they had been honest, courteous and punctual, I still would have left a 3/5. I understand that mistakes happen, but own up to them. This complex is horrible about its maintenance staff completing repairs, their pools in operation, and now apparently they drag their feet in regards to returning security deposits.  I hate to be so negative but seriously, I would rather live in a cardboard box then rent from JRK residential again if their properties are like this.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<text>Grounds are not well kept... dog doo doo and cigarette butts everywhere. A.C. unit leaks and when we informed management, they told us not to go below 75 degrees. In the heat of summer we went as low as 80 degrees and still A.C. leaks. Glad we moved out. Worse place to rent<//text><name>Gil Anthony Manipon<//name></record>

O My God why didn't I listen to the reviews. I've lived here only 3 weeks and I want to move out. Holly hell I'm freaking stupid... Don't be like me, don't be STUPID! Dog crap everywhere, pools that look like ponds, (yes there are ducks in them) carpets with animal crap stains, management or what I call (people that sit in the offices) that don't care. Best thing about these apartments is the landscaping on the outside that lures victims in. Go away,,, go far away from this apartment complex! You've been warned!<//Review>

I live here right now. Have for over a year now. This place is terrible!! If you put in a work order, the maintenance will not get it done, and they will say they did, when they NEVER DID! The staff will say they will do something, and they never will. You will be forgotten about by the staff and maintenance. If you are not home, someone will just walk in without your permission. One time i was in the shower and one of the staff members came in without even knocking!! Our A/C hasnt worked ever since we moved in, and still doesnt work. All the neighbors suck, they are loud and dont care about anything. Maintenance has come in and played my $1000 guitar without my permission! I never let anyone touch my guitar, and for him to come in and do that, hes lucky i was not home. Also, the neighbor kids do not care about anything, their parents will not care about what they do. The kids here will jump on your car and run away when you say something. The parents and staff do not do anything! Just want everyone to know. This place is not worth all the money. There will always be problems and you will never get it fixed. DO NOT MOVE HERE.<//review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Date>1520045181608<//Date><text>UPDATE!! March 1st 2018
I finally received a third of my security deposit due to various reasons that I don’t agree with. This was was dragged out for over 6 months. I hope people see my review and learn from my mistake of ever renting an apartment with the Arbors of California Oaks.

UPDATE!! JAN 11th 2018
- It is now over 6 months of not receiving my security deposit, and now management nor corporate are returning my phone calls and email. GREAT. If I could give this complex and companies negative reviews I would. Civil suit pending. Court Date pending. Hopefully your staff will respond to court mandated hearing.

Hello,

My name is Antonio Cetta. I was your Tennent from Sept 13th 2016 to July 30th 2017. I have still not received my security deposit. I know my rights as a renter, even in our lease agreement I am supposed to receive my deposit after at least 21 business days. It’s now December 8, 2017….. its  been six months. Not only have I not received my deposit BUT do I not agree with certain deductions (Which I requested a call back from a supervisor to go over with multiple times to only be put on hold or hung up on). I am sending you this message because I WILL bring you to small claims court if this issue isn’t taken care of by the end of the year. I would like a call from a supervisor to assure me that a check will be sent to my address which I gave to associate multiple times  and to go over specific deductions like Partial paint/materials, and Industrial Repairs, You have my cell phone on file. I don’t mean to come off rude or aggressive at all BUT my deposit have been way overdue.

I look forward to your immediate response

Sincerely,
Antonio Cetta
PS. Happy Holidays< /text>< gmapID>

I neglected to write a review because I wanted to put this place in my rear view. Yet after not receiving my deposit since July of 2016 and just recently receiving a call from collections about an amount owed that was never mentioned in the numerous times I've called to receive my deposit. This apartment complex is run a by a huge rental company JRK. They have no personal incentive to keep you happy or correct issues that arise. Many neighbors are loud. Domestic abuse and loud neighbors are quite common here. Talk to the Murrieta Police Department and ask about their reputation. All of this might be forgivable if they had a low price point but they don't, they list themselves as a luxury community. The whole complex has issues with ants as well. Please save yourself the headache.</Review>

Update: Still living in the same unit. Maintenance came in to try and simply patch up the walls that were damaged from the leak. We told them there would be mokd build uo and possibly fungus, which is all over the inside of the walls now. So they came in and cut open the walls and insisted we run a dehumidifier. Yeah no. We need to be moved and this unit needs to be cleaned. We are finally moving units on the 11th, but are not being compensated for rent, even though our kitchen and living room are completely unusable due to the uninhabitable conditions.

Oh yeah. They just tried to charge us a delinquent fee on our utilities even though the check had been cashed. This place is shady and we are taking them to court. Good luck to anyone looking to move here.

Upstairs neighbors flooded their apartment which leaked into our entire apartment. Management took over an hour to respond. Didnt come check for damages until two days later, and without us home, even though we signed that it was NOT OKAY TO ENTER without us being there. The day after that the neighbors flood again, same way, by leaving a washing machine on and leaving the unit. The neighbors have not been evicted, nor have we been offered any type of compensation or a new unit to move into. A manager wouldnt put an available unit on hold for us, although this emergency makes our unit uninhabitable. I would not recommend moving here at all, thid place is a joke. They lost our repair sheet you turn in your first 48 hours moving in. It's to list any repairs needed that were missed when preparing the unit. On top of that, they also lost our renter's insurance, which is funny, considering you can't rent here without it. They also upcharge you different rates for sewage and water, without listing thr variables that change the cost. Management is poor and shady and it seems they have a biased hiring process. I would avoid this place at all costs.< /Text>

<review>If they had negative stars, that would have been their rating. I tried my hardest to let bygones be bygones but after this last experience with them I had to tell the world of my horrific stay at the Arbors aka Hell on Earth.

If you are debating on living here -JUST DO NOT!  THESE ARE THE WORST APARTMENTS I HAVE EVER LIVED IN!

Where do I start? Just like you I wanted to save money on my rent... Like  the people below said "take your hard earned money elsewhere" or "you get what you paid for". This is so true!

1st day we moved into our SUPPOSEDLY "apartment ready condition apartment" the following is what we walked into and I promise I am not exaggerating. A huge bleach stain as soon as you enter the apartment, one window cracked and the outside screen ripped and semi falling off, literally the pantry door falling off the hinge, 2 electrical sockets not working, our A-C leaking a tad bit onto the already not cleaned carpet and the A/C Vent on the ceiling cheaply tacked on but still looked as if it was going to fall on our heads if we stood underneath it, our carpet was D-I-S-G-U-S-T-I-N-G, black dog hair EVERYWHERE. I literally could not stomach it I called the front office to let them know these conditions.  The management at the time wanted to argue about it, finally after 4 phone calls later and some yelling she said she would send the cleaners to re clean the apartment ( which never actually happened).  This is where my husband and I should have just moved away and said for get it.

2 months into living there our apartment A/C Unit stopped working. I called immediately and placed a maintenance request. It was a such a huge battle for them to replace our unit we had to literally call the HOUSING DEPARTMENT ON THESE PEOPLE! We were living in inhabitable conditions for a weekend our apartment was literally 92 degrees! After the housing authority called them after 2 months of suffering they finally FINALLY ordered us a new A/C Unit and installed it. Oh and for our troubles of overheating literally forced to leave our apartment because it was so hot we had to stay in a  hotel and friends house for the duration of those days we only got a credit of 50$. I am not kidding people 2 months of us not even being able to live in our apartment they only gave us 50$!

The pools were shut down for some of the time we lived there. If you want to do laundry i pray you have your own unit in your apartment because if you do laundry at the community laundry facility guess what you cant because the machine that reloads your laundry card NEVER WORKS. Often we had to make trips to  my dads house to do laundry.

After all this was said and done the last thing that actually drove me to even create this post was at the end when we finally gave our 60 day notice and told them we would not be continuing our stay there. I physically walked in there a week after getting my finally bill and paid it in person. THESE PEOPLE SENT ME TO THE COLLECTIONS DEPARTMENT!!!!! I have never been late or missed a payment of rent or anything else in my life! I literally was penalized for being a responsible tenant and paying my last bill!!!??? Please people does this make any sense!? For your sanity PLEASE AVOID THE FRUSTRATION, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, ANGER AND ANNOYANCE my husband and i went through AND DO NOT MOVE INTO THESE APARTMENTS. I hope by sharing my story you will make the right decision for you.

Now Cory one of the managers there does try to do her best but maybe corporate or who ever she works for does not give her the necessary resources to actually do her job. I feel bad for her Martin I hope you guys can get new jobs soon because what ever company owns these apartments are serious awful people.<//review>< pictures>

DO NOT GO TO THE ARBORS FOR APARTMENTS.
My boyfriend and I had the worst first apartment applying experience here. We worked with a really rude, unprofessional and  disrespectful woman named Deborah who is in So-Cal from Atlanta Georgia. She kept reinforcing we would get a $100 processing fee back if we decided to cancel our applications. She mislead us to believe we would be getting a refund and kept saying, in her own words, "I am going to play the Georgia card and act like I dont know what Im talking about". We called to cancel and she not only told us we were wrong and "Not getting anything back" but she decided to hang up on us too. Tried to talk to the manager, was really no help . Worst experience, we saw the bad reviews and decided to still take a chance. DONT TAKE THE CHANCE HERE LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS.Its too bad I cant give it zero stars.< /Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>DO NOT MOVE HERE.  SHADY SHADY SHADY.

I made the unfortunate mistake of moving here because I was not familiar with the area and the prices were affordable back then.

It was a year of hell.  Drunk and crazy neighbors downstairs, had to call the police three times.  It wasn't till I had recordings and a lawyer on stand by for the leasing office to take action.

NOTHING Luxury about this place.  The building is was built around the 70's and everything breaks and takes forever for maintenance to take care of it.    Parking is horrendous after 5 PM.

Most of the residents seems very sketchy and it's known to the drug hub on Murrieta.  EWW.

Finally moved to a wonderful place.  I've been expecting for a call, email, or mail of my moving statement showing how much they will be swindling us.  Well what do you know, THEY NEVER SENT ME A LETTER.  Instead they sent me STRAIGHT to COLLECTIONS.   They are charging us $1000 in damages, can't wait to see how they JUSTIFY THAT.

Just called them and they denied what they did and a) they just expect postal service to figure out the new address b) they can email me the statement right now.

Poorly ran, if you want to go thru all of this then please move here!< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dc825a513a9497:0x761b6a1e2e61176c< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Alert: do not move here. I used to live here and some people I know live there now. The things that go on here are borderline illegal.
I know someone who wrote a bad review and a few weeks later, someone from the office showed up with a 24 hour notice to inspect the apartment.

1. Rent everywhere else but here is due by the 5th with no late fee. The Arbors makes you pay by 3rd with a $150 late fee if you pay on the 4th. In addition, they'll only take a money order or cashiers check if you pay after the 1st. No personal checks.

2. Dog poop everywhere and most of the time the poop bag stations don't have any bags.

3. Thinnest walls I've ever lived in. You can literally hear conversions from next door units.

4. It takes maintenance forever to fix anything. They usually don't even show up when they are scheduled to.

5. They tow cars with expired tags.

I could go on all day, but if you don't believe any of this feel free to move in. You've been warned.</text>

Only been here for 2 weeks and already not liking it, they are not too good at communicating when you call them and something needs to be fixed, windows have black mold, carpet was stained when i moved in, got it washed but stains are still there, the only reason i moved in was because i thought they were luxury apartments but they definitely arent!!</text>

When you move in  here they do not tell you there are kids that are going to block your parking spaces and let you get your own apartment Parking space
They ride skateboards and bikes on the property and they threw fruit on your patios
Management does nothing about it
The staff is so unfriendly and rude when you try calling back after they get the sale
I'm not happy my friends moved in here
Terrible customer service !</review>

For instance the maple glaze is made with real maple syrup, not just an artificial flavoring.  The glazes are all made from scratch in house.  The donuts are all made in one masterful bake every morning.  All rolled and cut individual with personal care, not by a machine.  California Donuts is not a manufacturer type place.  Everything is done with care.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Rate>

<Text>Good service and good food for the type of restaurant it is. Couldn't ask for more out of a neighborhood bagel/ donut shop. Food Safety score is a 90, but the employees are polite and accommodate requests without sass. Love a place without sass.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Had to pay MORE than for original donut on 3rd street. Absolutely DISGUSTING donut quality. Just look at the pictures of original panda and of what I've got! It's made of different flour and "chocolate". HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE</Review>

I come here every weekend to get a Cronut and a drink. There's never a line and the donuts always taste fresh. There aren't many simple, no-frills places like this left.</text>

<review>As I travel across the country I search out good, great & best donut shops. This one is in the great category. Great chocolate covered old fashioned is my tell all. If that's good, the rest usually follows. And they did. Apple fritter is excellent & I also tried the chocolate chocolate covered raised. If only I had tried the boston cream donut. Next time!</review><Time>1584233489020< /Time><GmapID>0x80c2bf458f2fff61:0x32a017fbe412314c<//GmapID>< pics>

<text>Been seeing California Donuts on social media for what it seems to be AGES and have been meaning to come here forever. I mean, it's open 24/7 so it can't get more convenient than that!

So during Christmas week, I wanted to treat my family with cute, Christmas themed donuts and even reached out on Instagram asking them their hours. To my appreciation, they got back to me in minutes regarding their holiday hours (yay).

I did get over there, in albeit, a sketchy area of town, but was fine parking in front and hopping in line. You know a place is popular when they have ropes for lines a la "Disneyland" because it's so popular and waited about 5 minutes before I made my dozen-donut order which came to $31.

The donuts themselves are "OK." Definitely better if there's filling, such as the apple fritters, but the huge donuts that are in panda shapes for example, are quite doughy and really filling! I kept unconsciously thinking that the filling would taste through, but nope - lots of dough.

I think I would come back here but be a bit more frugal in my choices -- maybe get six donuts with filling, perhaps -- or even smaller ones. But, they are definitely works of art and recommend any donut fan to come here at least once and check it out!< /text></record>

honestly my favorite donuts in a lifetime of loving donuts. first off, they have buttermilk "and* old fashioned donuts, and both are incredible. then they've got the gamut of a regular store's selection (plus really unbelievable vegan donuts) up to and including the only cronut I ever thought was worth it. the woman who owns and runs it is very sweet and seems to work around the clock. an incredible bargain at these prices. better than any fancy or well-known donut place I've been to, by miles. treat yourself.< /review>

<text>Went here since it was the closest vegan donut place around. I got a panda donut And it was good but I’m not sure it was worth 3.50. The real kicker was the 7 dollar taro boba drink. The other boba drinks were 5 dollars so idk why mine was 7. Otherwise not a bad spot.</text>< username>

<Review>I lived just down the street from here for 4 1/2 years and my brother and I would walk down just about every morning and get their amazing cream sticks.  They are like nothing I’ve ever had before or since.  The cream is so light and fluffy and not overly sweet.  Even after I moved to the valley I would stop by any time i had an excuse to go anywhere near hollywood.  I moved out of California about 5 yrs ago and have been craving them ever since. (I think they make these round now instead of sticks, but still just as delicious!). The owner is extremely kind and friendly and even remembered me the last time I was there, even though it had been several years.  I can’t recommend this place enough!  As with any donut shop, the earlier you get there the better.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Terrible customer service. :( I came here thinking this was the original popular California Donuts and it's not. My husband did not like how he was treated by the Asian lady charging the orders. He was going to use card and she asked if he had cash to which he said no. She replied that would be a dollar more. Insane to charge a dollar more on a $39 order!  Plus she didnt provide a receipt so she probably overcharged him because I had seen her charging for a drink he asked about but didn't end up purchasing. He said he would never come again here. Thumbs down all around.< /text>

Everyone should go to California Donuts at some point, especially if you have someone visiting town.  The donuts are adorable and delicious.  The prices are great, too, especially considering the trendier places charge twice as much as California Donuts.</review>

< Review>
We really wanted to give this place 5 stars.  We were intrigued by all the cool doughnuts! But we actually stopped in for their lunch menu.  We thought we'd save a few dollars there. Im not so sure we did.
We ordered two sandwiches $6.50 each,  no sides. We took a bacon maple bar and a drink.  It came out to $19.25.  Not extremely expensive,  but hear me out...
The shop was suffocatingly hot. We couldn't sit and enjoy our food there.  The drinks in the fridge were also hot.  We asked for a cup of ice and she charged us for another drink. Lastly, she didn't provide a receipt.
So we give this place a ,"meh!😒".<//Review>

<text>There is really nothing special about California donuts other than their specialty donuts.

They serve donuts with special toppings such as oreo cookies and cereal. My favorite is their bacon topped donut.< /text><user_id>114595125503780367072</user_id>< resp>

Sonoma County Auto Care is the best!! The owner Chris is incredibly trustworthy, kind and generous with his time and expertise. I've been using their services since 2016 for big jobs like a Timing Belt replacement, and small jobs as well, and I'm always impressed and satisfied with their work. I can't recommend them highly enough. Recently Chris and one of his workers identified the source of a very annoying noise. I found the little replacement part I needed online for my 18 year old Volvo, brought it to Chris and in 10 minutes he had fixed it. I've been very satisfied with all the work they've done on my car.</Review>

I am extremely happy that I chose to take my car here. Great turnaround time and just genuine and friendly people working here too. The lot in front of their garage is always full of cars when I drive by, and that in itself is a testament to how many people go here. Highly recommended!!!</Review>

<Review>Great people here. They're very good at diagnosis, and their labor rate is quite reasonable. Most of all, they're honest and trustworthy. They really care about their customers as individuals, as multiple experiences here have taught us. Wish I could give them 6 stars.<//Review>< rate>

<text>These guys are amazing! I just had a tune-up here today. I thought I might have a transmission problem but they quickly found the minor problem and fixed it for me for a fraction of the price I was worried I would have to pay for a major repair.

I love this shop. The guys are super nice and accommodating. They give me tips to save money on car repairs and are genuine and honest. I first stopped here to get a second opinion on an $800 brake replacement. They checked and said my brakes were fine but needed cleaning and proceeded to clean them for free. I love that they are just up the street from my house too. I trust their advice and know that I would never get ripped off here< /Text>

These guys are amazing. They consistently do great work, always going above and beyond and never overcharging. Since I found them a few years back I won't take my car anywhere else. As a woman without a ton of auto knowledge, I am often wary of being taken advantage of. From the get go, the guys at Sonoma County Auto, especially Chris and Robert, have made me feel so comfortable- often taking me into the garage to see the problem with my own eyes. They are extremely trustworthy and always looking out for the best interest of the customer, often offering a variety of options and trying to find the best price within my budget. Couldn't recommend more highly!<//text>

Wanted to share my most excellent experience here. Was passing through on vacation. Me,  my wife and 2 large dogs. My starter left us stranded the week before Christmas. Called Chris at 2:30pm. He was slammed busy and could do it the next day. That would work for me as other shops assured me they could get to it the next week. Had my diesel pickup towed to SCAC. New OEM starter was ordered before truck was off tow truck. New starter was installed before 5pm THAT DAY. Was billed for less than an hour for labor. They even checked my fluid levels and topped off as needed. Highly recommend this shop. Thank you again to SCAC for turning my vacation frown upside down.<//text>

<Text>Incredibly impressed with customer service and speed of service. Called at 8am on a Saturday, they were pretty booked but when I told them I was from out of town and kind of in a pickle they told me to tow it in and they’d see what they can do. In less than 15min they had diagnosed it, and ordered the part needed. They were replacing the part before the hour was up! Overall great experience and fantastic service. Cannot thank them enough for their willingness to take us in and get us back on the road before the afternoon!< /Text>< pics>

<text>I'm selling my car and went to get a few things checked out. Owner spent 15 minutes doing an engine check, giving me recommendations & educating me. Not only did he not charge me, he would not take any money when I offered. This business has a good owner with integrity. He's on the younger side so hopefully he knows what he doesn't know ~ I'd go back in  a heartbeat.</text>< UserId.>

I've been going to some version of this place over the past 8 years, and since it has become Sonoma County Auto Care they have become my go to mechanic. These people are not normal. The prices, the quality of the work... superior.<//Text>

<Review>Sonoma County Auto Care, formerly Neighborhood Auto Care (NEW OWNERSHIP)
Saved me from being majorly ripped off by my own "neighborhood" auto shop who quoted me $275 for a tune up and $400 per axle for brakes (then quoted me $85 for a tune up when I called them just now....hmmm).
These guys are fast, reliable and honest!
They actually told me that I didn't need new brakes for a while so I focused on the tune up and oil change and am going back to have my air conditioning system fixed next week.
Because of their excellent customer service , honesty and very reasonable prices I will take my car there for any service and repair needs.
**I live in Marin County** but will make the trip out to Sebastopol to give them my business.
The words Honest and Mechanic used to never mesh..  here it does!!< /Review><userid>103736110696580881290< /userid><rate>5<//rate>< Time>

Very personable atmosphere and reasonable costs for work done. Moved here from SAN Jose and I’ve been looking for a hometown mechanic for some time and found it in my “back yard”; Wes is just around the corner from me...literally. He makes you feel welcomed and talks about the problem and things that are needing to be addressed. It’s like hitting pay dirt!< /Text>

I then had a steering box replaced among other things on a 1998 GMC Sierra, again affordable, top-notch work, and finished when promised.  I'll be using them in the future, no doubt.<//Text>< Pics>

Wes has taken care of multiple cars of mine. He is an honest and fair mechanic. Twice now they have spent diagnostic time figuring out what was wrong and Wes only charged me for half the time that he actually could have charged me for! I highly recommend you take your cars to Wes for  great work and fair honest prices<//Review>

<text>Wes is very professional and straightforward and treats every customer respectfully.  I was tired of being ripped off and treated poorly at Future Ford and have had nothing but a great experience at Gallardo’s. Wes’s advice saved me $1,500 when Future Ford insisted I needed a new battery cable along with a new battery. When I asked if it was truly necessary, I was told, “absolutely!”  I even had a text message from my service advisor saying so. Wes suggested I ask for the old parts and offered to look at them to give me his opinion, even though it would be after the fact. So, when I okayed the service at Future Ford, I told them I wanted the old parts. When I went to pick up my car from Future Ford, they changed their tune and said the battery cable didn’t need to be replaced after all. When I referred to the call and text saying it was “absolutely” necessary, they blew me off. Wes won my business from that day forward and I’ve received nothing but excellent and fast service.<//text>< Pics>

<text>I've been bringing my vehicles in for servicing at Gallardo's for several years.  I have always walked away a satisfied customer and have never had to bring any vehicle back for a workmanship issue.

My vehicles run great and when there's an issue Wes and his mechanic's have always been able to troubleshoot the problem and come up with a solution. I've always been in good hands and trust Gallardo's.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<review>What a great experience.  Wes and the crew are unique fellas.  The customer service is second to none!  They replaced the valve cover gaskets on our fan and what a difference.  They worked closely with us, surpassed all our needs and expectations.  If anyone, anywhere, needs a repair look no where else.  you have found the best there is!  Thank you fellas, thank you so much!</review>< pics>

Always a pleasant experience when we take our vehicles to Gallardo's. We are a military family and it can be difficult to find a trustworthy, honest auto shop at a new duty station. We have been very pleased with their honest, and quick turn around on our vehicles. Thank you!< /text>

Never had a problem here. He understands what I need (and want) and always delivers. Whenever I need work done on my Prius, he is the first person I think of. He is quite familiar with the idiosyncrasies of hybrid cars and manages to make them work as they are supposed to, inspite of their strange designs. I would recommend this place to anyone who needs help with their car.< /Text>

Wes was very helpful. I scheduled a pre-purchase vehicle inspection for a vehicle I was interested in purchasing. He was able to show me issues with the vehicle before he conducted the inspection and gave me great advice to consider before he charged me for his service. I will be a return customer.<//Text>

Wes is reliable, does a great job, and always gives different options with no pressure.  Recently, my husband took his truck in on a battery corrosion issue.  Wes took a look at it on the spot, told him what to do (instead of hiring him to do it).  His advice worked, and we saved some money.  Thank you Wes.

<rating>5<//rating><review>When we moved here in 1995 my wife, Suzi and I had no knowledge of any of the services that were available in and around Rocklin.  By chance we dropped into Gallardo's to check up on a problem we were having with one of our vehicles (Can't recall details that long ago).  What I do remember is that the owner, Joe, wound up fixing the problem the following day for what I felt was a reasonable price.  I would characterize Joe as the original "no surprise guy."  He would always do his best to provide all the facts before recommending a solution.  That kind of thinking was passed on to Wes, when he was given the opportunity to take over ownership.  Wes and his team have given us top notch service from changing air filters to replacing an entire engine in our son's pickup.  We've never felt the need to go anywhere else, although we have ventured out occasionally with marginal success.  For any auto problems I would strongly recommend giving Wes a call.< /review>< pics>

I recently went To Gallardos  for the first time. I took my subaru forester in for a smog check& an oil change. Wes  seemed very knowledgeable& was very courteous. They took care of both things& for under 100.00 out the door.</Review>

<text>I've been going to Gallardos for over 10 years. I've had 4 vehicles in there over that time, including my old 82 Jeep which they've done transmission work and put it fuel injection on. They've done a ton of work for me and I've always felt that they've given me honest service. Their rates are not necessarily the cheapest but the work has always held up and I haven't had to go back repeatedly for the same problem.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I had a phone appointment with Dr. Kram today and I was very pleased with the knowledge (he has been in practice since 1970) and advice that was shared with me.  He listened to my concerns, was very kind and answered all my questions.  Vibi is part of the team there and she was SUPER helpful and responsive in getting me an appointment.  I really appreciate the care and service that California Center for Sleep Disorders delivers.  5 stars, highly recommended!< /review>

< Review>
Has taken several weeks to get results. They scheduled a day to go over results and I missed the call and called back within five minutes only to be on hold for 20 more. Then told they didn't have any results recorded and I might have to take it over. Then a few days of no contact, I called and they said there were results and the thecnian didn't do it correctly. My question is if all this was an issue .... why did they schedule a follow up call to go over results with me? Completely unprofessional and highly wouldn't recommend. Apparently they have staff that don't  know what they are doing. They might be taking advantage of claiming insurance and providing inaccurate results for insurance money.</Review>

Aiko is wonderful.  She is thorough and respectful.  My internet connection was lost during my virtual appointment.  She reached out to me on my phone to complete my appointment.  I feel Aiko went the extra mile to help me.  She has a very pleasant and friendly demeanor which is helpful to ease nervous patients.  I find all the staff very friendly and helpful also.  Job well done.  Thank you!<//review>

The first page of the directions for the testing was smudged and extremely difficult to read.
And the NP I worked with was really good: she listened well and explained the process of testing as well as the results in very clear terms.<//review>

<Review>I wish I read the Yelp reviews.  They are accurate.  These reviews seem fake to me.  And if you look below, there are a bunch of people who feel the same way.  My recommendation is to avoid, avoid, avoid.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>Aiko and the rest of the staff definitely want the best possible outcome for patients . . . and they really do make you know you're important!  Thank goodness for Aiko Loo.  She heard my thoughts and some annoyances I've experienced.  The only reason for 4 instead of 5* . . . because of the poor communication re: appointment.  P.S.  Still not sure why we weren't able to converse via the teleconference / stream . . . . I felt that I did follow all of the steps to set it up properly from my end?  Thx, Bruce</text>< pics>

I was satisfied with my visit, NP Aiko was very knowledgeable and well versed in Narcolepsy. You would be surprised at some of the doctors I have come across who specialize in sleep medicine and know very little to nothing about Narcolepsy. She was very understanding and compassionate. She was able to give me an alternative medication to see if I may tolerate the medication better than I am on my current regimen.

Overall I am extremely satisfied and glad to settle down within this practice after losing my old HMO insurance and having to find a new practice/doctor.</review>

< Review>
My appointment was handled efficiently and on-time with no waiting. Since I was only in the SF area for a short visit and therefore did not have the time to undergo a sleep study, Dr. Kram offered a variety of intermediate solutions to address what appears to be sleep apnea until I can return for the study and a proper diagnosis. I also learned a lot from the visit.< /Review>

Dr. Ruddy is very informative and helpful. He was very patient in explaining all of the findings and answering all of my questions.
My sleep lab tech was also very nice and patient and made sure i was comfortable every step of the way, being that i have a very bad back and was in a great deal of pain when i went.  Would recommend you go there for your sleep problem. They have several locations to choose from.<//Text>

<Review>Their office in Concord gave me an appointment to pickup a machine in Alameda. I showed up on the date and time given, and after a bit of wait they said "You need an appointment to pick up a machine."
like this one I drove all the way out here for?
So basically got nothing done... No new appointment no machine...
Sorry but the disorganization is ridiculous.
She said we'll call you and I seriously doubt they will call...<//Review>< pics>

<Text>We were having problems getting a delivery for a sleep study machine delivery for my son. After many reschedules, Richard and his boss, Marcy made sure that we got the sleep study machine delivered and they also made sure that we were satisfied with the outcome. A very special Thank you to Marisela in the Billing Department. She went above and Beyond to help us with the insurance portion of the Sleep Study. We will definitely recommend this Company to anyone that needs it. They get a huge 5 Star Review from us!</Text>< Pictures>

<text>Very attentive. Many relevant questions were asked to ascertain any issues and/or problems and determine if any adjustments were necessary. Good suggestions made regarding making improvements in overall usage of  the cpap unit and the resulting benefits. Looking forward to more and better sleep in the future.

< Review>
My experience with Kram was excellent!!
However, I do want to clarify an answer to a question he asked me about my existing CPAP machine.  The full face mask does have a stabilizing component that connects to my forehead, and my mask size is a medium.  I am clarifying my answer because I believe he needs this information to complete the order of a new CPAP machine for me.
Please pass the foregoing information on to Dr Kram.  If I need to get this information to him another way, please advise.
Thank you,
Stephen Jacobson</Review>

Easy to work with.  She passed-on a request to order a cpap hose for me at SleepQuest.  I had an email from SleepQuest by the time I got home.</Review>

<text>Aiko Loo, nurse practitioner, has always been kind, caring, positive and supportive.  She consistently goes beyond what is expected, and offers helpful, practical suggestions for living with sleep apnea and the C-PAP. I am grateful to have her as my provider.<//text>< pictures>

Was told to go to their Alameda location but they didn't tell me the address. Called to get the address and was treated to 5 minutes of hold music followed by a voicemail box. Not a great experience so far.< /review>

I wouldn't say "I love" going to the Doctors office, but it was a very pleasant experience.  Dr. Kram was up front with his opinions on my choice of a new CPAP machine, and answered all the questions I had.<//Review>

Aiko Loo has helped me a lot regarding my sleep problem.  Also she has helped me in selecting a new sleep machine which will replace the old one I have been using since April 2009.< /text>

By far the worst doctor's office I've ever worked with. Ignores all emails, patient portal messages, and phone calls, and changes their policies frequently. I've spent 15 hours trying to schedule a single follow-up appointment because of how unreachable they are. AVOID AVOID AVOID.< /review>

So far I have spent 45min without getting them to answer their phone - yes it's business hours.  They moved my appointment and left a message with new time without ever consulting me.  The mail box is full so I can't leave a message, the website has no space for messages that I can see .  so far not so great really less than 1 star<//Review>

<Text>Been trying to schedule an appointment since March. Numerous times they've told me that not to call them but they would call me to schedule an appointment. Had someone call me in July saying they need my insurance information to schedule an appointment and the person barely knew any English and I told them I could fax them my insurance information but insisted it must be done over the phone. This is not a professional operation.< /Text>< response>

These guys know their stuff. I have been loyal to carquest from the time I was in middle School when the other guys sent me home from with the wrong part. Since then I go there even when all I need is a little information about a party or car that I may be servicing, and the staff there are helpful and friendly. Thank you to ask the fellas down at carquest autoparts.</review>

This is a good old-fashioned auto parts store where there are more parts behind the counters and out in the front on display. ask at the counter and they will help you retrieve the correct item for what you are needing for your vehicle at this time super helpful and friendl staff.<//Text>

Always friendly and knowledgeable. Plus it's nice that their warehouse is in Bakersfield which means that they can get what you need sooner than other auto parts stores.<//review>

They have everything you need from oil to auto parts . If it's not there , they'll order it for you. It is a very little wait 2-3 days at the longest . Great place I've gone there for years</Review>

<Text>We asked for a birthday cake for an eighteen years old and we wanted it to look like a female wearing a bikini. They said they could do it. However, instead of wearing a bikini, the covered the girls body with icing. We paid sixty dollars for it three days ahead of time. Also, when we went to pick it up, they told us they didn't have anything like that. We left, bought another cake, went home, celebrated the birthday, and then the bakery called us back and asked if we were gonna pick up the cake because they were about to close.<//Text><rating>2<//rating>< username>

<Review>The cakes are delicious and I love that she makes strawberry cake BUT most of the time the cakes I've ordered never come out the way I've asked or showed them and to top it off they also come crooked. It's frustrating but I always go back for the strawberry one, I just need not to expect the perfect cake.</Review>< Pics>

Forget this place if you want a nice place to go. The unprofessional woman behind the counter called me a liar when I noticed that she forgot to bag something i paid for and then she argued telling me i was wrong. Do your self a favor go to the one on barstow and clovis next to 711 way better maners and prices.</Text>

They are simply the best here!   The bakers thr artists it's a family owned business and my Lyft rider gave me the hook up.  The cake was delicious and I got so many pleased people raving about it!  It was beautiful and GOOD.   The first time I went the girl was a little slow and kinda informed me .... but the rest of the people  muah!  Great</Text>

<Text>Never again I don't recommend it to anyone. If i could put negative stars i would.We order a cake set for my cousin. We paid over $1000. We gave pictures what we wanted and colors. Very disappointed when we received it. Wasn't nothing like we asked for. Some of the cakes were lopsided. Instead of the design we requested all the cakes were airbrush the same color. Not very good airbrushing either specks and spots everywhere and then they try cover half the mistake with ribbon. Piping on the cardboard was awful. Some of the cake was burnt or stuck to the foil they put on the cardboard. We order glass cake stands instead they gave us plastic ones. We had set the cake ourselves and fixed it the best we could ourselves.</Text>< Pics>

<text>Dear station Manager.....
I’ve been coming here for over a year now and never, until now have I had a very bad experience.
Your employee by the name of Erin is VERY VERY rude. She got upset because I thanked her by her name (Erin) that is on her name badge. Really!!!!
I walked backed in to get my car wash receipt and she slammed it on the counter. I said you have a nice day and she stated to me that “it was until I addressed her by her name because that was creepy because I didn’t know her”. I’ve been in Retail for many many years always  “wearing a name badge”.
I would not tolerate my employees being rude like that!<//text>< rate>

Pay bathrooms which are poorly maintained and toilets don’t flush.  Recommend finding a place which has better service.< /Review>

<review>Unlimited, Monthly, Machine-Touch, Carwash oh my!! for only 19.99 a month plus a 1 time charge for a RfID windshield sticker. One time I needed a new sticker because of window tinting, and they didn't charge me again. Nice People. You have to renew the carwash during the day shift because the night shift is never allowed to touch the RFID carwash computer. Try to pay 2 months at a time since they don't offer autopay, and the daytime clerk is often new. To pay for 2 months the daytime clerk is allowed to put any expiration date into the R.F.I.D. carwash computer, but the daytime clerk has to charge you twice, as 2 different transactions at the cash register for the 2 monthly fees. Now your car can be legit looking everyday. Best times for no carwash lines are 10:00pm - 4:30am on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Beware of the guy on the weekend afternoons waiting by the entrance of the carwash waiting for you to trigger the RFID so he can get a free carwash. Stay back until it's your turn.< /review>< pics>

< Review>
We pulled up to what seemed like a short line thinking things would go by quickly as only 2 people were ahead of us and they had already ordered. We sat for 20 minutes without any of the cars moving. Then we finally ordered and got to the window and paid. Then waited another 15 minutes or at the window for our food, we didn't even order a lot. Then when we finally got our food they didn't even give us our full order, our fries were missing.</Review>

<Review>I'm going to tell you something you didn't know about Burger King. I'm a firm believer that the masses are not aware that you can get a really good frappe at Burger King and a large at most stores around me AR just over $2. This is compared with over $5 at Starbucks and it tastes equivalent. Of course you can't get 300 varieties of frappe like you can at bucks but at less than half the price is the deal of the week. Attract I'm going to have one probably within about 30 minutes cuz we're leaving to get a phone fixed. I want everybody to try a frappe from Burger King, they have mocha and Carmel. My favorite is mocha cuz I think it has Hershey's in it. Anybody that doesn't like Hershey's chocolate is unamerican and I want you on the Canadian border within 24 hours to leave this country. I'm posting a picture of myself to reveal the true Joy I feel when I have one of these frappes</Review><user>115849256778308635296</user><Response>None< /Response><rating>5</rating><date>1601418618528</date>< GmapID>

<text>This burger king location is HORRIBLE! The drive-thru took 15 minutes just for two small items. The customer service was also terrible, the drive thru attendant was very rude. She had a bad attitude. The worst part was that I did not receive one of the items ordered. LAST TIME I GO TO THIS LOCATION!<//text><time>1600286819805< /time>< rate>

I give this place 5 stars because of the staff and clean place and good service and they do their best to make sure that you get what you order right the first time. Even though some times I have been a  Difficult customer lol They keep their cool . We have to Burger kings in our small town the 1 after 190 is the one I preferred to go 2<//review>

Great prices, very fast service. Restaurant was decently clean. The food was cooked when we ordered and came out hot. Overall, a good experience.</Text>

Good experience. The food was delicius, and the staff was very nice and courtesy. Clean place and very affordable prices. The most thing I like there is the games on the tables where kids can play. So, I will come back.<//text>

The sad thing was that neither the manager or the employee could figure it out and I had to walk them through it  S L O W L Y...</Review>

Whopper hamburger is a particularly good tasting sandwich.  The inside drink machine has many selections but Coke is nasty ... and that is what I want with my burger.  Bummer.</text>

This is a comfortable, fast food establishment, with good service. I eat here regularly. The food is always tasty. The employees could be a bit friendlier though.< /review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>I went through the drive through sunday Aug 4 2019. I ordered 2 king meal deal's. They charged me for some one else's meal because the person on drive through didnt know what they were doing. When they tried giving me the meal i didnt order I told them that wasnt my order. After messing up my order they then over charged me for what i originally ordered and tried acting stupid and refused to give me a receipt. They lost my business for good. Garbage staff.< /review>< Pictures>

Great service. Everything done right to my standards. I used to think this. Untill this Burger King on 190 Porterville. Now I do not even want to go to this one ever again. I like my sandwich my way. And this restaurant can not seem to get it right. Ever. You can't say no on some items and heavy on other items. Because the end results according to them is heavy on everything So I now get to starve. Corporate cant even except a call because this restaurant does not answer the phone ever. So I get no closer.<//Review>

Very friendly service, the food wasn't very good and tasted old. Fries were cold and the cherry Dr Pepper tasted like cough syrup.
I'll pass next time.

UPDATE:
Came back for lunch today. (11/28/15) Thought I'd be fair and give them a second chance.
The chicken sandwich was hot and fresh as well as the onion rings. The food tasted better and the drink was perfect. Was about to update my review and came across a curly black hair wrapped nicely around my last onion ring.  The manager was very apologetic and remade my order but at that point I wasn't hungry.< /Text>

The worst drive thru for a 30 min lunch. I work right down the streets I figure going through the drive thru would be easy quick and fast. I only order one combo it takes 20 min to get my food. Never coming back. Carl Jr. Is a lot faster then them or Jimmy John. Even El Polo Loco is faster.< /review>

<text>Went there a couple of nights ago the crew person who took my order was very friendly and did an excellent job of taking care of the customer.  Unfortunately I had ordered the two Whopper special and the meat was cold, tomatoes were even worse, to make it even worse I believe a 4 year old could have done a better job of putting the sandwich together.  The sad thing is I got my order to go so it wasn't checked before leaving.  Really should we have to check before leaving?  I really don't think so!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80eab861ce453aad:0xf322913567236629<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Took my kids for dinner last night.  2.99 kids meal can't be beat.  Plus free sample cone for the kids.  Not the highest quality food but hey it's fast-food burgers.   Got just what I expected.<//Review>
