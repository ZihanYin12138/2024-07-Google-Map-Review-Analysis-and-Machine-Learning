Small fish store. Lots of salt water fish to choose from. Not a lot of tropical fish choice. Tank was dirty, algae hard to see fish in tank.  Most of tank had no light. It was kind of dark Inside.</review>

<Review>i’ve been coming to Carson tropical Fish for over 20 years I’ve never had an issue with the owner Tom he’s actually really cool or chin or anyone that works there their prices cannot be beat he works with you on everything honestly it’s the best fish store I’ve ever been to and I’ve been in the hobby for 30 years as far as returns go and stuff like that that he absolutely will always back the product he sells so don’t believe in the negative reviews is not true must be somebody working at strictly Fish. You get very high end coral here for half the price of anywhere else , And he has a awesome selection of used equipment that he will sell you for really good price like I said tom is an awesome guy the owner the staff is really friendly don’t believe in the negative reviews they are not true< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Ok so this place is a bit on the dirty side, however it doesn't have that fishy smell.  They seem to specialize in corals, and reef tanks.  Why this place gets such a high rating from me is that their customer service is second to none, and their prices are very fair to excellent.  And the health of most of the fish in the store seems to be very high.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Sold me a “new” tank. I was convinced. However, when I got home it clearly was a repaired tank of some sort...full of scratches and poorly siliconed (it was hard to see the damage/imperfections in the poorly lit store. You get what you pay for. THEY DO NOT DO RETURNS. The store is also extremely dirty. Do yourself a favor and  Drive a little bit further and spend a little more at Strictly Fish. This is an expensive hobby where quality is a must. Listen to the bad reviews.< /Text>

Best Place for coral flags, everything is reasonable there. And they know what they are doing, willing to help as well.

Always come here for my saltwater and corals. Yeah I've been coming for years, so I can't say if they are rude or not to others. I just walk in and get what I need. Fish, coral, and water conditioner etc. I get that strickly fish is down the street, and yes they keep their business nice and up kept. Yet, I come here for the prices, which is less than strictly fish. I'm not saying I dont go to strickly fish, but I do for other needs. It's a great selection to have, plus they have great steals. My coral from are all thriving so I dont know and I can't Say for others.<//Text>

<text>I was weary of buying fish or plants from this store because of concern for their health. I know the difference between an aging store and store that may not be doing the best maintenance on all it's tanks. My service wasn't bad, but all I was doing was grabbing RO water. After visiting stores from Covina down to San Diego this fish store scores low compared to the dozens of others I have visited. If this is your local store and you just are toying with the hobby it will meet your needs. However if you are looking for inspiration and mastery knowledge I have to say this one misses that signature.< /text>< pics>

<Text>The positive reviews here have to be friends of the owner. I've been here three times, usually after visiting the outstanding Strictly Fish up the street. The difference is striking. As well lit as the alley behind it, tanks as dirty too. Livestock selection limited to sick or dying. Ich,  hole in the head... Been to quite a few places, dozens really, this shop ranks at the bottom.</Text>< Pics>

one of my favorite fish stores. great selection in coral reef. always finding great deals on collector corals. good place for new and used equipment.
The people who gave this store a bad review was for the stores appearance. this is not a petco or petsmart.
selection, prices and customer service is the reason why i shop here.<//text>

At first I thought maybe my water temp was too hot but nope it was absolutely perfect. I spent 6 hours trying to figure out what had happened and I measured the salinity of the water that they gave me and it was wayyy to salty and the water even smelled funny and the worse thing is I asked them if the water was safe for saltwater reef aquariums and they said it was perfect:( and a lot of the freshwater fish look like they are in terrible shape. I recently bought some goldfish because they are 12 for a dollar and I was going to add them into my mini pond but the water that the goldfish lived in smelled really bad and made me nauseous. They had pacus with gum infections and 99% of the freshwater fish looked stressed out. But some of the people there are friendly. Overall they have good prices on some stuff but don’t let that fool you because they’ll end up dying.< /Text><gmapID>0x80dd2dd1fc7cf9f3:0x4d6ea5a17a07bdb< /gmapID></record>

Awesome store for any saltwater aquarist looking for excellent service at a great price! This place has a lot of fish, and coral selections. Huge live rock reservoir. Lots of materials and supplies to pick up at amazing prices. The employees are very friendly and knowledgable. I visited the store with my girlfriend, my only critique would be that the store is a bit messy, but other than that we both had a great experience here. Highly recommend.<//review>

< Review>
First time checking this place out .. and last time I will purchase here.  I wanted to check out the fish selection and looking to purchase a conditioner for my fish tank water . As I was taking my time checking out the fishes and products I had a weird employee following me around he did not ask me if I needed help until he felt like I was taking to long to purchase something from the store ... I responded as he asked very rude if I knew what I was going to buy ... And I responded to employee if I was making him nervous or something .. or did he think I was going to steal something ... He didn't say anything back after I asked him ..he just walked away .. So COSTUMER service here is not good .. or maybe this guy was just not performing his job correctly . I still purchased a product for my tank even after him being very rude and making me feel unconformable ..I should of not purchased anything from this store period . I will diffidently never go back here again .  By the way his name was Cheeme or Chung or Chang not sure he wears glasses. I hope the owner has a talk with him to explain the importance of costumer service for costumers here or we will diffidently scare costumer away . I hope I get a response from the manager soon.</Review>

Everyone in the shop helps you  and pretty much educates you.

I really recommend this place they will answer any question< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<rate>4</rate><Text>These people and their reviews, A BAD experience at Carson?? Get outta here.. This shop is by far the best shop around..I travel quite a distance and always have.  I pass 4 other Tropical Fish Stores just to go see Carson.  Let me tell you an experience.  I was living in Fountain Valley.  Shopped called TONGS, I had a aggressive fish in my coral tank.  I asked what solutions that had to get the fishy out.  I was told to go look over on that isle and they had fish catchers.  $80 for a glass box with a closing door.  I needed it and bought it cause I couldnt make it to Carson before they closed.  Caught the fish that night.  Took the fish to Carson the next day.  Saw the same Fish Catcher at Carson brand new for $50 but they had a used one they said "Next time you need to catch a fish come borrow our catcher and bring it back."  Carson has been the only shop that doesnt mind testing my water and they do it with a smile.  Instead of saying "oh your good" they tell me exactly what I need to do to get things running 100%.  If you ask for help you get it at Carson.  I also own a retail business and I understand the importance of customer satisfaction.  My hat is off to the guys at Carson Tropical Fish..< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dd2dd1fc7cf9f3:0x4d6ea5a17a07bdb<//Gmap_id></record>

7.7.2011...I started keeping tropical fish in 1985 and I could immediately tell that this is a bare bones operation for the hardcore hobbyist. If you need frou-frou hand holding and a shiny store just limit your worldview to PetCo and stay there! If you are an experienced reefer with 4+ years experience come here and you will find bargains galore. You need to look past the dust, coralline algae, and salt creep and REALLY LOOK at the corals. It's like going to a club swap, really cool selection with rock bottom prices. The same applies to the used equipment, you have to know what to look for. I bought a used & working 250W HQI MH Nanocube hood for a steal, with ballast included; and tons of SPS & softie frags too for a client's setup. There are good deals on new aquarium packages. The new dry goods selection was okay, but they can always order what you need at fair prices. The marine fish selection was disappointing but I've noticed that many brick & mortar shops have stopped trying to compete against the online retailers on both regards. You're better off going to the shops near LAX for fish. Even Vivid Aquarium, Age of Aquariums, Pacific Reefs and so forth halfheartedly stock fish. Tong's in Fountain Valley has a good fish selection, but only with a 65% survival rate once brought home. I don't even know why Carson Tropical Fish stocks freshwater, they seem like an after thought, but it must be for the neighborhood families and kids. The owner's English isn't the best but there's usually a younger employee around if you have problems communicating. I received excellent service and noticed other customers did as well. I drove over an hour to get to the shop, and albeit off-putting at first, am glad I did. Now it's ranked amongst some of my favorite SoCal LFS's. Give it a try!<//Review>

<Review>Absolutely worth the drive from Cottonwood! I had never heard of Crumbl but the buzz had hit my son's classroom. We decided to take a day trip and indulge. A little spendy but a wonderful treat! The cookies did not disappoint. Warm- delicious and full of flavor. I would highly recommend you give it a try.<//Review>< user_name>

They all welcomed me in unanimously, and I was given an in-depth explanation of their menu options. They even take the time to show me my cookies before I leave! It’s also very nice being able to watch how the cookies are made; a very exciting experience! 10/10 will be back every week!< /Text>< pictures>

Need a new addiction? I got them for delivery and they arrived super quickly, warm and super yummy! I'm blown away by the packaging and the quality of these cookies! I can't wait to try out new flavors! You all need to try them! (Get some milk too!)</text>

Quality of cookies are amazing! Best I’ve ever had. Bigger than what I imagined! Weekly menu changes are awesome. Not one cookie has disappointed me. Excellent customer service! The app is easy to use especially for curbside pickup. I noticed on the app each cookie has a recommended eat warm/cold which I thought was neat.<//Text>

<Text>Cookies are AMAZING!! Only somewhat downfall is if you like a cookie flavor you have to wait til they have it in stock again, but kinda cool that they always have something new to try. Definitely need a glass of milk with these yummy cookies, love how most are served warm too. Definitely worth it!< /Text>< resp>

<text>So far, this is turning out to be the death of my figure. I can't seem to find the willpower to turn off weekly notifications for flavor changes because I. WANT. TO. KNOW.
Fat, thick warm cookies ready in like 1 minute? A little more than I pay for desserts typically but they match in size so what can I say? This place has been doing too-good of a job leaving my sweet cravings satisfied.< /text>< user_name>

<Text>When you walk in, the amazing smell of baking cookies hits your nostrils and works it's way into your soul. You immediately want ALL the cookies. You make your way to the self checkout area where you can't decide what to try so you order a box and let me tell you... You aren't disappointed. These cookies aren't just cookies. They're like a cookie and a cake made a delicious dessert baby. So. Damn. Good.<//Text>< gmap_id>

Ordered on the app for curbside. Arrived, checked in....they were busy so I didn't mind waiting. Finally the store was empty and nobody was bringing my order out. Went in and my cookies were just sitting there. They had no idea I was waiting in my car! Not sure what happened. No complaints about the cookies though. Have loved every one I've tried!< /Text>

<review>Walked in and it seemed like a really nice shop, but I overheard the owner or manager talking bad about other people. It has happened both times I have walked in. Not sure if it was about employees, but from what he said it sounded like it. I definitely will not be coming back. I won’t support someone who mistreats their employees.< /review>< Date>

We stopped by today and grabbed 2 of each of the featured cookies for the week. Oh my goodness they were a hit with the family. Red Velvet, Bannana Cream, Dirt, PB, Chocolate Chip and Lemon Cooler. I was especially impressed with the Bannana Cream. It was the perfect balance and NOT too sweet or to fruity. The cookie crust was perfecttion.< /Text>

Great service and even better cookies! These cookies definitely live up to the hype! They’re definitely pretty pricey (so are all CA Crumbl stores) but they’ll be a nice treat every once in a while when they release a flavor I can’t pass up on. 10/10 would recommend.< /review>

<review>Upon initial investigation I discovered this new Chico cookie merchant on the block "crumble" which I assure you their cookies do not do.  At first glance you will notice the abnormally high price of a cookie at this location. After deciding to give a fair review me and my buddy went in on a party pack and made sure to get one of every cookie this week at least for a test, our conclusion is this. The cookies are good, that being said its hard to mess up a cookie so good wont cut it, especially a ridiculous $4 a cookie when the same quality chocolate chip cookie can be purchased at the cookie shop for a fraction of the price. Each cookie is the same dough base with different toppings, the base itself is extremely sugary and the toppings add to increase the sweetness to a sometimes unpleasant level.

These cookies are some of the best cookies I’ve ever eaten in my entire life. Like it’s goes my Grandma’s cookies are Number 1, because no one makes better cookies than my Grandma, sorry, followed by these guys. I dream about these cookies and sometimes I feel like I’m cheating on my grandma’s baking when I eat them but it’s just too good to pass up. The best part the whole family loves them and we never argue over them and we actually can share them. So thank you for uniting a family who usually fights over cookies.<//Review>

Best cookies around! I love that the menu changes every week and that the chocolate chip cookies are made with milk chocolate instead of semisweet!<//review>

I thought they were soft due to being warmed. However I have had the worst tummy ache after eating one, and then just exorcist vomited all over my bathroom. I felt fine until about 20 minutes after eating my cookie. They taste delicious, but make sure yours are cooked fully before eating.</review></record></dataset><record>

Cookies are super soft and delicious. Definitely the best sugar cookie I’ve ever had and all the different weekly flavors are killer. The Chico store is the best crumbl location I’ve been too yet, they were so quick to get my order out for curbside pick-up and the staff was super friendly and cheerful. Definitely recommend stopping in and getting a cookie or 12!</Text>

Been waiting for a location to open up close enough to try these, and when they finally did, I wished I’d ordered sooner! Perfect amount of soft chewy cookie, but still cooked. And big enough you don’t mind sharing...to much 😂< /text>

<Review>Rude and stuck up employees, only was here to pick up a door dash. Was basically ignored as they all where in the back, luckily they made me feel welcome with a sarcastic “welcome to crumbl!” from everyone working, however they couldn’t bother to help and hand me the box of cookies sitting on the counter in front of me.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>I have been here 3 times. Now that im frequenting, I wanted to leave my honest review. I have seen a Fijian dude (this was a few years ago) but most recently I met with Theresa and Alice. Both amazing at beard trims. They listen and pay attention to ensuring your happy. If you dont like it, speak up and they will fix it. See you guys soon<//review>< pictures>

This was my first time at Blades and getting a cut from Antonio. If you have thick wavy hair and a hard time describing what you want with haircuts, go with ANTONIO!

I came in with long unruly hair, but he knew exactly what to do with minimal input due to my inability to explain what I want.

I finally found a barber that I will be going to back to regularly.<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Awesome service. While all the staff is incredibly talented, if you want the best haircut you've ever had every time, make sure to ask for Alice. She's one of SF's hidden gems. She doesn't just give you the haircut you ask for, but makes it look even better than the best haircut you had in mind. I haven't let anyone else cut my hair since I had my first appointment with her a few years ago and would easily pay what she charges.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x8085808ad048feef:0xcfaaa211466a703f< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>I loved the service because my boyfriend's haircut was done amazing. You guys can get a good haircut too with a decent price here. You could feel comfortable because the people here are friendly and very kind. He had a shampoo, cut and beard trim. Nice! We'll be using this service again. Thank you so much, guys!</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Antonio is absolutely amazing. Support him as your local barber and hairdresser through these challenging times, you will not be let down and I bet he will be your new long term barber as well. The rates may seem a bit high here but Antonio is worth every penny and a healthy tip on top of the normal rate. He also does color and women styles as well, and my skin fade was absolutely top notch. A master of his trade and easy to see that hair is his passion.< /Text>

<review>My son was having his haircut this morning in this barbershop. The barber who took his hair done was amazing. He was so friendly and love kids, too. He was easy on my son, especially on the razors. He suggested to his haircut today, and it was perfect! The cut was clean and nice for my son.

My hair grows every three weeks, so I went with this barbershop again and again. I loved them the most because their way of entertaining customers was nice and very good. The place was clean, tidy, and fully furnished. Also, I always felt comfortable when I was with their barbershop. The way they do haircuts was clean and excellent!</Review>

I regularly go to this barbershop due to their friendly staff and the quality of their service. Yesterday I had Carl, who took extra care in cutting and styling along with friendly discussions while doing it. I also had the great pleasure of being the first customer to have an extra service by June who also made sure I was comfortable. I will be returning again!< /review>

I had an excellent cut with Antonio.  It was my first cut with him, I was able to describe the fade I wanted, which was pretty detailed and complicated, and he did it expertly, using a combination of clippers and scissors.  He's got a great eye for detail and obviously cares about what he does.  Bravissimo!< /review>

Super easy to book online! I love my haircut! Yes it’s a little bit more expensive than some of the older places in the neighborhood, but you are paying for the convenience of online booking, a chill atmosphere, ability to pay w a card (a lot of barbers only do cash), and the security of always getting a good cut. I recommend Shaibaan - he cut my hair exactly how I wanted it and was relaxed and friendly. Thanks!</text>

<Text>Great full-service haircut/shave in FiDi.

1. Making an appointment is a snap.
2. The place has a cool retro-mod feel.
3. The service is good.
4. Most importantly, if something isn't right with your experience the owner will fix it.

PRO TIP:  Bring CA$H for tipping.< /Text>< pics>

<text>Go here. Ask for Jen. Communicate what you want. Tip her well.

The instructions for cutting my hair are fairly precise, so my demands are detailed and focused. Combine that with being a perfectionist, and it means working with my hair is not always easy. Blades Co has a great ambiance, very-welcoming staff, and - most importantly - attentive, talented stylists. Jen listened to exactly what my concerns were, recommended only a few minor changes, educated me while she was working, and just perfected my cut. I've had barbers all over the world I've worked with for long periods of time, and Jen was able to put all of them to behind me with one cut. Will be going back as long as I live in San Francisco.</text><Resp>None<//Resp>< Rating>

Inept time management. I have had a few haircuts here scheduled and none of them have ever been started on time, and had 1 start 30minutes late and just left after giving this place a another try after it happened again. And they have never called to mention they were even running late.

Overpriced, always late, and just bad compared to other barber shops in the same price range.< /text>

<review>Bad service. The barber wasn't polite and too expensive what I paid for that poor service. The girl at the front desk ask me about my service and I let her know that I didn't like it and she did not do nothing.</review>< pictures>

Will not return - barbershop called 10 minutes before appointment to cancel. Caller was apologetic but definitely discourteous and disrespectful to cancel 10 minutes prior when they require 3 hours notice for a client to cancel.</text>

I get my haircut here because of the old school service and just plain great vibe in this place. They have a lot of regulars, that tells you it is where you need to get your next cut!<//text>

<review>The most expensive haircut I have had, but I'd have to say it was worth it. Normal barber in the area would be $25, Blades is $45. They provide a much better service than a 'normal' barber.<//review>< username>

These guys were so great! I didn’t have a bug repair but they put my headlight in in 19 minute and since I brought the light part they did it for free.< /review>

<user_name>Melody Mazure</user_name><text>I brought my van here as some lug nuts had broken off and was given a quote that included 3 hours of labor which seemed high since I have replaced them before. It was less than 2 hours between when I dropped off car and got the call it was done but they still charged me for the full 3 hours of labor, plus they still left one of the bad lug nuts on both the front and back tire when they should have just replaced them all while they had the wheel taken apart. Be wary of being overcharged here. The only good thing about the experience is they got my car in fast.< /text>< gmapID>

I use them for managing my wheel alignments.
We buy their 3 or 5 years of alignments for our cars.
Each time the alignments are off we make an appointment and they fix it in 30 mins.
Best alignment deal ever.
Thanks for the prompt service each time.

Be aware that while all Big O tire locations will correct alignments when you show them your receipt, not all Big O tires sell this package.
So visit this location and take advantage of this when in the area.< /Text>

<Text>Very poor customer service. Spoke with Chris who said he is the manager. Not very customer focused. Actually very rude way he communicated. Unfortunately this store is right around the corner from me.  I will be looking for a different location. Big O, you should look for a customer service focused manager.< /Text>< pics>

I called in to get a quote and sat on hold for at least 10 min.  At the very least let me know you’re busy and to call back.  The person that answered the phone seemed lost and unprofessional.  I’ve been bringing all 5 of my cars there for service, not anymore!<//review>

I previously had my tire service done with a competitor who could not care if I was there or not. Your manager greeted me with a smile and a can do attitude. Additionally your price was 10% below the other store. Price is always important but the customer service given by your staff closed the deal.
Thank you

I had a fast leaking tire one late afternoon.  I had an evening appointment and also needed to drive to the airport early the next day, so no time to waste.  I called Big O Tires near my house and they were able to accommodate me with short notice.  Luckily there weren't that many people waiting for their car at the time.  They patched my tire within an hour and I was on my way.  Service was excellent and the cost wasn't that much.< /Review>

< review>
The check in manager was exceptional, my issue is when they finished putting on 4 new tires my rims were extremely filthy.  Grease completely all over them. I would expected them to at mimimun attempt to wipe them clean, I had to ask for rags and do it myself in front of the gents who replaced my tires.  This was awkward
Again the manager who checked me in was exceptional, he just needs to make sure the help takes the time to finish correctly.<//review>

It was extremely overpriced. It was 240$ for 2 front tires (I asked for the cheapest ones). And when I got my car back he tells me "you know your battery is completely dead right?" And tells me they "had to jump it just to get it out of the shop". He then tells me they usually have batteries in stock but don't today. We I got in my car my radio no longer worked due to the supposed problem with my battery. However what I think really happened was they took my battery out of my car and we're going to put a bad one in in hopes to sell me a new battery but realized they had none in stock and put my battery back in my car. The reason I think this was as soon as I left I checked the volts going from my battery to my alternator using my multimeter I have in my tool bag in the back of my car, and everything was fine, I even turned off and turned my car on multiple times that same day. I've been driving with the same battery for about 2 weeks and no issues. I really feel like I've been ripped off. The date if my service was 12/6/18< /Text>

<Text>Horrible service took the truck in for an alignment and had to take it back to get it done again shims came out according to the manager.  after the second time the shims came out again I call the manager once again to explain the situation and his answer was that they never touch that part after they put shims in the same part that they claim they never touch the first time  and the manager was super rude and what surprises me the most that his quick answer after the second time I called them  was we can refund the money so you can take it somewhere else hopefully this will reach the owner and he can fix my truck that his so call mechanics screwed up the first time</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1563553236817, 'text': "Jose, we regret that you had a negative experience with us, but are glad you brought this to our attention.

<Review>These guys are the best!!!

Had a problem with two stripped lug nuts, corners were rounded, no way to remove.  Took my car in on a Sunday at 9:15 am, these guys were slammed with real tire buying customers, but said they'd try to help me.  Brought some work and figured I'd be there a few hours and not sure if they could fix it.  Another shop told me they might have to drill out the wheel stud!

Within an hour Steve, one of the techs. came and told me he got them both done!  He broke one of his tools to get the lug nut offr but he didn't want anything from me!!

Thank you guys so much!  Anytime I've been there everyone has been so nice and helpful.  I would have paid $100 bucks, and they didn't want anything.  Great people!!  Mike from Dana Point.< /Review>< pics>

<name>Justin Edwards<//name><Review>The one dude is so dry and rude. The first time I stopped by because I saw the now hiring sign and he was really not nice at all.  Didnt seem to want to even give me an application to fill out. Gave him the benefit of doubt and just let it go.  A few weeks later I went in with a flat that needed to be plugged.  Asked him about the promotion on their window and he acted as if I just didnt qualify. I asked him about pricing for just getting 2 new tires he seemed to just not want to help at all.
I left and went across the street to another place and the 2 gentlemen were really nice.  Just like the rest of San Clemente. I love this town because the people here are really nice. But that dude really doesn't know what good customer service is.</Review>< date>

What happened to...
Good customer service!!!
It went from 5 to 0
I thought service should get better and not worst
So I came in with a flat tire
(* Keep it local they said)
They were too busy, and asked me to come back the next day
I arrived at 7:30 and he found an other excuse to not fix it
Maybe my business was not much he even said that it will be a liability for such a big company to fix my flat tire, he recommend an small mom and pop shop
I guess I will take my business somewhere else
Will not come back again or recommend to anybody< /Review>

I asked how long it would take he said I would have to leave the car for a few hours? Because he had appointments? It's a 20 min job? After purchasing at least 27 tires from big o and at least 6 from this location, its time to find a better local tire shop that provides better service. I won't go there or buy my tires from big o again.< /Review><Rate>1< /Rate>< gmapID>

<Text>One of my trailer tires developed a bad stem. I first went to Costco because it was close. They won't service any tires unless they sold them. I won't be going back there except for groceries. I made another call to an independent tire store near Dana Point at 5:00PM. They said they were too busy and would not be able to get to it that day even though there was an hour left before closing. I called Big O in San Clemente. They were pleasant and enthusiastic on the phone and told me for as long as I got there before closing time, they would fix me up. I realize this is more of a pain in the rump and isn't a money maker but I was set on going fishing the next morning. Not only did Big O fix me up quickly, but insisted on not charging me. My Rav4 needs new tires and I know where I will be buying them. I don't feel any need to shop around and I won't. I have to thank the other 2 businesses for not helping me out as it enabled me to find a real tire store. Thanks again Big O!</Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< date>

Went in for an alignment , rotation, balance and had some front stuts installed. I was told the rotation was free because I had work done to me suspension. Still got charged. That's not the bad part. They never rotated the tires! Came back and they told me it was due to the tires being in such bad condition... Well that would of been nice to know before I left in the first place... I then asked for the $20 refund on the rotation and they told me they couldn't because the manager was not available to approve it. I would have to come back next week. Not only did they lie about the rotation service never even given they told me they filled the tire pressure and to my surprise it was 8 lbs below the tire recommended pressure. They told me then after complaining that I needed to purchase tires asap and that my vehicle was a safety hazard. Went to Costco and they said I was good for another 3000 miles. Horrible service.< /text>

Worse service i have even seen in almost 30 years.
THE MANAGER LOOKED ME IN THE EYE AND LIED TO ME.
said that they did work they did not do.
said my vehicle would require additional billing of well over $200 because, get this, "it requires shims".... 4WD IFS trucks no not require shims.... when confronted they still refused to do the work.

It will be interesting to see what the C.A. Bureau of Automotive Repair (BAR ) finds here in their investigation.
I will also be notifying BIG-O corporate to examine this location as well.

I have lived in san Clemente over 20 years. this shop was terrible 10 years ago, and it is still terrible today.

**************  DO NO GO HERE!!!!!! if you value your hard-earned money and your LIFE (out of vehicle safety) DO NO GO HERE!!!!!! *******

Worse service i have even seen in almost 30 years.
THE MANAGER LOOKED ME IN THE EYE AND LIED TO ME.
said that they did work they did not do.
said my vehicle would require additional billing of well over $200 because, get this, "it requires shims".... 4WD IFS trucks no not require shims.... when confronted they still refused to do the work.

It will be interesting to see what the C.A. Bureau of Automotive Repair (BAR ) finds here in their investigation.
I will also be notifying BIG-O corporate to examine this location as well.

I have lived in san Clemente over 20 years. this shop was terrible 10 years ago, and it is still terrible today.

<text>Do NOT buy a Groupon for this place.  I went there to use it and since I wanted synthetic oil for my Honda they said there would be an additional cost.  Fine that is what I expected from the fine print.  What I didn't expect is that it would be $65 MORE.  What a rip off.< /text></record>

< Review>
DO NOT get your car washed here! They take no responsibility for damaging your vehicle. My side mirror got damaged on my car months ago but I understood it was probably due to the strong brushes. My mother loved this place. She would come to this place 2-3 times a month. But not after today. The tire rail that moves your vehicle along the car wash malfunctioned and completely took her tire out of her wheel. They took no responsibility and blamed her for moving the steering wheel even though she knows what to do while in the car wash since she visits this place often. They saw a older lady and realized they could get away with not helping her and blame the situation on her. She would always say she loved how the guys at this place washed her vehicle. Truly disappointed.<//Review>

Paid and waited over 30 minutes in the vacuum station only to watch over 15 cars be taken to be cleaned before mine. Only after the initial wait did they FINALLY start my car wash. Never visiting this joke again!<//Text>

< Review>
We just spent 1.5 hrs and nearly $40 for a shell gas station car wash.  None of the interior was cleaned, the windows are still dirty and the bottom panel of the truck still had caked on dirt.  Don't waste your time or money.  They don't care.</Review>

I've been visiting this car wash ever since I was a kid and it's an awesome experience! A great spot for a quick wash during the week. It beats the other car wash for it's express service!

They provide a quick oil & filter change that would get you in and out in a jiffy! They also include a multipoint inspection with details on your vehicle's overall performance.

I highly recommend to check out their website for coupons on any of their services.<//Review>

<Text>Got my truck washed this Saturday morning by Splash.
Truck was dirty inside and out. The staff there did a fantastic job.
Even the areas around cup holders and stereo pockets were scrubbed
clean.  In and out in under 30 minutes.  Thank you Splash team for
another great job.</Text>< Resp>

Great service with a smile. In and out. With a basic exterior wash. A little longer with a full service wash. Plus if you need your oil change you can get one too.. Most waits about 45 minutes to an hour and a half.. Depending on the clients requesting services ..</text>

I’m sorry but I won’t be coming to the Splash first of all I asked the young man to please vacuum my car before it went into the wash, they ignore my request and just drove it in. Secondly after it was done getting out of the wash bay it was parked and left in the sun for a good 20 minutes, it was not a busy day so no need, the part that really threw me off was that the young man sprayed my paint all with window cleaner to take off the stains now their streak and more stains !! What the hell was that, I won’t be returning back</review>

<review>Rude, arrogant, owner named Dale ignored my calls, laughs at me and to top it off hangs up on me after I tried explaining a situation that happened there with my windshield. This individual has no customer service or customer care skills at all!  When incident occurred manager on site had me write an incident report but for what??? Owner didn't  bother to call me back to follow up. I had to call him 5 days in a row in order to finally speak to him. Owner doesn't care and won’t take responsibility for what happens to customer vehicles at his carwash!

Looks like all he cares about is putting our money in his cash register!!!

*When taking your vehicles for a wash here....try to take before and after pics of your vehicle especially of the windshield! Dale the owner will wipe his hands clean, not bother to investigate incidents reported, and won’t own up to them!</review></record>

I went and they did the worst cleaning this last time. The lady cleaning my car was rude about me telling her she missed a spot and why the carpet still had garbage and my mats were not cleaned when I asked for them. I had to wait an extra 30 min for that to be done when it could've been done right the first time.<//Text>

<text>Never again I took my truck there with a brand new paint job on it just wanted to get the dust off at so I felt pretty comfortable with what they were going to do had to bring it home and wash all of the freaking soap they left on and off of there and then the two guys that were supposed to be detailing and wiping stuff down spent more time bullshiting than they did rubbing anything I'll never take my car there again which is unfortunate because it got good reviews is close to my work and it seem like a good place I wouldn't let him wash my bicycle< /text><Time>1541961907137<//Time>< UserId.>

<review>Waste of money!!!! I spent $26 "THE KAHUNA" for my car to be cleaned inside and out. It didn't turn out that way. The service was really fast so i gave them a $5 tip. I soon realized that they were really fast only because of the reason they hadn't even cleaned half of my car!! They left the inbetween of the seats dirty and didn't even clean the trunk(which i paid for)! They also didn't even wipe the inside of my car down!!! Waste of money! Never going here again!!!!</review>< pics>

<Review>I have to say that being spoiled by Mr Hot shine in AZ and TX this really missed the spot. The girl didn't know what the packages included for the car wash.

When pulling up you can tell a very big difference of the missing spinners and undercarriage sprayers.

When it came to washing, the entire system felt and sounded like it was going to collapse.

On the drying, they did take their time, by that I mean there were about 6 cars waiting to dry and I could see the spotting starting to happen from the sun partially drying the water.
*******
I do have to say that they really get every nook and cranny of the car wiped, when they do start drying. They open the doors and spray cleaner and re-wipe the interior frame ***awesome*** THIS I do wish Mr hot shine would do!!! This is almost like a hand wash addition for free! This would normally be a 3 star for me but the attention to detail on the drying was above and beyond!
*********

Price?
I tried the $15 wash just to try this out.<//Review>< Response>

I just got my car washed here. I got the option that costs  $25. It includes interior vacuum and exterior clean and dry. I am satisfied with the wash, the only MAJOR problem was that all my quarters were STOLEN from my cubby compartment. Every single one of them. I am not sure if I will be coming back.</review>

It's a quick and easy wash but there is no hand wash offered and the automated wash is not touchless. At certain time the business gets crowded but you are usually done within 1/2 hour. Prices are moderate and the staff pleasent.< /Text>

<text>The carwash services are terrible.  After my carwash there were streaks on the insides of my windows, dirt in my tire wells, some strange straw looking debris on my carpets, and the inside cup holders /interior plastic had not even been wiped down.  If I wanted a crappy job, I could have done it myself.<//text>< Pics>

This place is ridiculous. If you  have a hint of mud on your truck or suv they will turn you away and they do so rudely. Obviously I work in fields and I brought my truck to get wash at a freaking car wash and they turn you away. Not to mention the owner is an ass hole< /text>

(Translated by Google) No, I liked it at all, they don't wash the rugs and if it's an extra they don't offer the service. They did not clean well inside and did not put flavoring (it was included in the package), I think it suits me better if I vacuum it and wash it

(Original)
No, me gusto para nada, no lavan los tapetes y si es un extra no ofrecen el servicio .  No limpiaron bien por dentro y no pusieron aromatizante ( estaba incluido en el paquete ), creo me queda mejor si yo la aspiro y la lavo< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I adore this spot! They serve high quality dishes, their menu is large, The chief cook in that restaurant is a professional, I love a lot trying all their food. The food is consistently good, the attitude towards the customers  is very good too. I frequently visit this place and I not even once was discontended. I recommend it with no hesitation.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Highly recommended.  The dinuguan and ginatang kalabasa are super yummy.  I gave them high rating because of reasonable price, good customer service, food very savory and they give you generous amount of food.  I will surely go back if I am in the area.</review>

<Text>Finally, I was able to find this restaurant near in our area. Their food was very good, the vibe of the restaurant was fun and lively. I truly enjoyed the amazing foods they served. I will definitely be going to save this restaurant's contact number for future reservations. They deserve great ratings!< /Text>< gmap_id>

Both visits have been pleasant, nice customer service.  They seem to know what I want before I ask.  And they had outdoor seating that they keep separate and clean for customers.   Quality is great for price.  I'll be coming back again.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPov8vLK6PkHVyX0oSTeavN7T2OhPyLPBPWDU2O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

<Review>I just tried the tastiest meal for the first time, and it was delicious. I special order a few different items through my local health food store and there are weekly staples for lunch and dinner. I love the awesome foods they serve! The servers were so friendly and accommodating to me. I will surely share my experience with you to my friends!<//Review><name>opal mehta</name><Response>None<//Response>< UserId.>

< Review>
I tried this place when it first opened and found it fairly forgettable. I tried again today and it seems like they've stepped up their game. The BBQ pork banh mi was delicious (very good pork). I also had the vermicelli with bulgogi steak as well, and it was solid. Finally the wings were well made: crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I'd definitely consider coming back next time I'm in the SoFA area< /Review>

<review>This place has the BEST Vietnamese sandwiches in town and the loaded fries are delicious!! Can't wait for this stupid covid stuff to go away so we can enjoy a pitcher or two of some of the coldest beer around. Friendly service with a smile. Great job Nest Asian Bistro!!<//review></record></dataset><record>

I had just recently moved to San Jose and out of all the restaurants I had tried, nothing beats The Nest. Not only is the food amazing, but the aesthetics and atmosphere of the restaurant is hip yet homey. My favorite things to get are the Banh Mi sandwiches and the burritos--both are rich and flavorful and makes you want to savor every last bite. I have yet to try their other food items and drinks, but I'm sure that everything on their menu is superb. Overall, I just want to thank those at The Nest for such amazing experiences and great food even with the pandemic going on. I officially declare The Nest my home away from home. ❤️<//Review>

One of the best restaurant around here.
Food is fresh, and price is fair.
The only issue is it takes time to prepare your food; of course the reason is they are making it fresh, right there.<//review>

Came into the nest today. cute little spot right by the college cooking some awesome Asian fusion food.  Chicken wings were amazing as well as the bulgogi fries.  Honestly though don’t sleep on the Pho it’s amazing.<//review>

Came in looking for a late lunch. We had a weird experience, which I hope isn’t typical? We walked in and nobody was at the counter. At first we didn’t think much of it, and kept chatting amongst ourselves while we thought about what we wanted to order. We could hear someone in the back and assumed they would be out to take our orders. Kept waiting and nobody was showing up. We called out “hello?” a few times just to let them know we were ready (bell wasn’t out, but noticed one further in the kitchen). Still no response. We decided to leave, but when I glanced back in when we were on the street I noticed someone finally peek out. Ordered our food, pork banh mi and a salted cream oolong. Food came out fairly quickly, but we received the wrong sandwich (a beef bulgogi) and the tea was mostly ice. We had considered trying the beef anyway, so we didn’t ask for it to be changed. For us, the sauce from the bulgogi did not pair well with the rest of the sandwich. And for paying $5 for a drink, we were a little disappointed that it was pretty much just a cup of ice with some tea. Maybe it was an off day, but kinda disappointed with our lunch. I might come by again, but $12 for banh mi and $5 for a drink is too much considering San Jose has a ton of great banh mi places that go for like $5/sandwich and boba bar is right next door.<//review>

Incredibly friendly and helpful staff. We had a pork bhan me, tofu bowel and Korean BBQ. All great. There's indoor and outdoor seating. If you're going to a play at Hammer Theatre, stop here for a meal.< /review>

Tried their curry and its really good.

The plastic utensils made it kinda hard to eat the soups since the spoons are so small so I would suggest you bring your own.

They have alot of variety to chose from and I highly recomend to give the place a visit.</Review>

Had the vermicelli noodles with grilled pork.  It didn't come with the typical sauce that you get from a vietnamese restaurant when you order this type dish, which I was expecting. I asked for the sauce, but they gave me bulgolgi sauce and said it was good. What?< /text>

Talk about a total hidden gem! We went to view this place as a potential for our wedding venue and it is best described as stepping into a secret garden. From the moment we stepped into the gate, we fell in love. The grounds are well kept, the building is cozy and intimate.< /Review>

<text>I had my wedding here last month, Rockefeller Lodge is a beautiful venue; my ceremony was outside reception inside. The food was amazing, the staff was beyond friendly and my photos came out great in their outdoor setting. I have since recommended this venue to a few people and would consider having another event here in the future. Debbie is awesome and very helpful!!!<//text>< pics>

Nice intimate sized hall to rent. The outside is cute for small intimate weddings. There's a kitchen area and small hall to set up and serve buffet food. It had everything we needed to the wedding we attended including a dance area.<//Review>

I'm been here for 2 wedding. It is a small venue. It can be uncomfortable getting up from your chair. People have to move for you to pass.<//Review>

Great place to rent for parties. 100 plus year old hunting lodge in the middle of san pablo.  With all the trees it feels like being in the forest.  This is not a hotel, it is more of a community center.<//Text>

Great coffee but still a bit expensive. At least the selection was better than some of the other stores. The quality tasted no different but no worse either. At the moment, the shop is located close to the road and so that helps alot when looking for convenience.</review>

This place has really gone down hill. They have a whole new crew who appear to be more interested in chatting than serving customers, like cast members from Mean Girls.
I'm left wondering if the shop has changed management. I won't be spending any more time and money there.<//review>

Nice Peets with fast and friendly service. The reason for 3 rather than four stars, this was the first time during covid-19 I've been served the display pastry. Instead of selecting a fresh prepackaged pastry, they gave me the one on top in the display case.<//review>

If you like strong coffee or tea, this is the place in town to get it!  Friendly staff, clean shop and restroom.  Lot's of sugary pastries to choose from.  Stop in and meet the locals doing business over coffee.</Text>

Good food and coffee but the staff is so busy goofing and flirting with each other they tend to lose track of your orders. So you have to keep an eye on them.</text>

<Review>Nice thrift store, good variety of different things. I've found some good audio equipment here an at very reasonable price. most the stuff is a really good deal, every once in a while you'll see something priced very oddly. All in all I would recommend if you're looking for vintage clothes, audio/video equipment, books and defiantly furniture.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>I bought a 200 piece Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Greg Heffley puzzle and only got 194 pieces. I paid a buck fifty for this, I'd like my 4.5¢ back. Other than that, a pretty good experience.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808035560ae92eef:0xf56292bf1dbb57a6</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>The Paul Bunyan Thrift Store is one of the longest running thrift shops in Fort Bragg. Their proceeds go to Parents and Friends, a real pioneer organization that has been helping the developmentally disabled for years. They have friendly, helpful staff and a wide selection of goods. They sell furniture too.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>A true thrift shop, you never know what you will find. It is well organized and varied with music, clothes, art, books, furniture, toys, household knick-knacks etc. Easy to find on a busy road with plenty of parking. Worth the trip.< /Text><Name>Susan Larsen<//Name>< user_id>

Teacher did a great job of answering questions and was very thorough. She seemed a bit nervous but she was a champ about it and it did not take away. Social distance and COVID-19 precautions were taken. Fast easy, experience, with all the seriousness you would expect.<//text>

Kimia was great. She was super fast and efficient. She always added a little flare to her demos to break the ice. I will definitely be coming back when I need to recertify.</Text>

Great hands-on experience. Answers questions. Discusses real-life situations/scenarios that on-line may have not covered. Follows Covid-guidelines with gloves and social distancing. Demonstrates a bleeding wound wrap.</text>

Kimia was my instructor and she was very informative. She went through the steps for adult and pediatric techniques when faced with choking, CPR when faced with unresponsiveness, and first aid when faced with bleeding. She also went through what to do in certain situations with calling 911 and using an AED. She did a very good job explaining and I will be coming back to renew! Wonderful instruction. Easy to follow. I did the blended course and the online portion was great too.</Text>

Very informative class. I really liked how the instructor would give supplemental information for why things had to be done a certain way. For example, when performing abdominal thrusts, we have to make sure we’re pushing in and up to make sure we can remove the lodged object. And how chest thrusts mimics chest compressions on a choking patient.</Text>

You can take the online portion first at home at your own pace, then come to the facility for demonstration.  I love it. Highly recommended 👌< /Text>< pictures>

Clean space, socially distanced, and very well coordinated with the online portion of the blended course.  Instructor was energetic, professional, and knowledgeable.

<text>I enjoyed the course, both online and the in person sides! For the online course, I thought it was very simple and clear. The videos were simple and easy to understand and the missions were able to give me an idea of what the scenario would actually be like. The in person class was pretty much the same as online, except that we actually did the activity, and that helped me better learn how to perform CPR. One minor issue was from the online class when I tried to move on to the next section and it just didn't load, but other than that I had a good experience.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

So this is my first time actually taking a CPR class aside from what they teach us in any school or educational environment. I’ve been wanting my certification for a while now and a friend encouraged me to come take the course with her. Overall it was a great class, Melissa was our instructor and she was super nice funny and help us get through the course without any complications. It was an enjoyable experience and had fun taking the course I look forward to taking more advanced courses.</Text>

<Review>I just finished the class it was very detailed and offered different scenarios. I enjoyed having to do some scenarios on my own and having the instructor walk us through the others. It allowed me to critically think what I would do in that scenario. Very easy to complete and renew my BLS card. The instructor was very nice and allowed time for questions.</Review>< Pics>

This class by far was the best I have participated in a long time! I appreciated the blended learning and was impressed with their COVID-19 protocols. I was also impressed with the smart dummies they used. You got a better sense of compressions!! I will be back in 2 yrs time for recertification!< /text>

I found out that I needed to complete a first aid and CPR class for work, so I signed up for the class with Hear CPR and I am so glad I did. I have taken first aid and CPR classes in the past and I literally just sat and listened to the instructor for four hours and it wasn’t very engaging, but that was not the case with Heart CPR. The instructors were absolutely wonderful! They were lively and very knowledgeable and we’re willing to answer any questions I had. Because of Covid the class was taught 3 1/2 hours on zoom and one hour in the classroom, which I loved because I felt completely safe. When I went into the classroom I was happy because everything was very clean and social distancing was practiced. Cory the instructor I had for the in class portion was so great. He explained everything very thoroughly and also made us laugh with his jokes, which I really appreciated because sometimes these classes can be a little boring. I will be definitely using Heart CPR again!<//Text>

<review>I took this for my own personal knowledge, as I have a 15 month old. I’ve completed cpr/first aid training multiple times before, but never online. It was actually great! The scenarios really help drill the information, so don’t be worried about forgetting anything! I started out with a lot of anxiety, but ended being very confident I’ll respond well in an emergency. Very informative, easy to complete, knowledgable and friendly instructor for the in-person portion.</review>< gmap_id>

I did the hands on training at Heart CPR and Kimia did a great job walking us through it all. She is very knowledgeable and patient. Even with COVID and there being restrictions on how much interaction there can be, the course was still a success. Would definitely recommend to take your hands on training with Heart CPR and if possible, with Kimia.< /review>

During this training we reviewed the steps for administering CPR and if someone was choking. The in person class is very helpful along with the online training. Our instructor went over some helpful tips that people normally do wrong. I always take courses with Red Cross and they never disappoint.<//text>

I just did my renewal class today during Covid-19 and I'm super happy with how the class and classroom was set up. There were 5 tables about a little over 6 feet long and spaced more than 6 feet apart.. Each table was set up with 2 stations so a maximum of 10 people this class. I loved that everyone wore masks and were very keen on following social distancing rules. We were provided with gloves to wear during demonstrations and Chlorox wipes to wipe down the props and dummies down after use. Our teacher was very nice and straight forward with the information and demonstrations which was super nice. It made class go by quick. Highly recommend and would totally go back again when it's time for renewal.</Text>

<Review>I appreciate the use of high quality CPR equipment with light signals that let me know if my compressions are effective. In my previous CPR classes at other locations, it was a guess on how well you’re actually doing on older manikin models. All the equipment is sanitized and cleaned after usage. The mix of video and hands-on experience was great on ingraining and understanding the concepts. Ms. Fontes offered helpful constructive critiques and advice during and after practice to ensure all students know how to improve their skills. She was also encouraging and open to answering our questions. Overall, great and would recommend!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Great clean place to get your CPR certifications (AHA & red cross). Instructor was helpful and to the point. They email you the certification within a couple of days. They do charge $8 for the wallet card copy which is purchased online. But great and to the point overall.< /text>

Chris was an incredible instructor who was very informative. I learned a lot in the class and he made all the information very easy to understand. His demonstrations and attention to detail was quite helpful and I am glad that he was my instructor. Chris Rocks!!</review>

The in-person class went from about 4-8 and the instructor (Megan) was super cool! She shared her own stories which made the class more exciting. The manikins were new and each person got their own. I highly recommend this class!</review>

I took training with Chris Navarro last Friday. He is an organized, knowledgeable, helpful and caring instructor. Highly recommend to take training with him! I am sure that other instructors in this place are just as good, but it was Chris who taught my group. It was engaging and informative! Thank you, Chris!</Review>

Highly recommend taking this course with this group if you’re looking to complete for a work-related reason. Their knowledge of CPR/First Aid material is outstanding and will keep you occupied for the entirety of the lecture. Has plenty of activities to keep you engaged!<//text>

The teacher was a firefighter with lots of experience and made it fun 😊👍<//text>< name>

Melissa was awesome!! Was not looking forward to having to do the in-person portion after 2.5 hrs of online BUT Melissa not only made it worth it but made everything WAY clearer than the online portion and was super fun! Really appreciated being able to hear everything that wasn’t clearly explained online!!< /review>

Pros-

Autumn is extremely professional.  Even before the class date she reached out via multiple emails highlighting class expectations, materials required and links to materials through the Red Cross.

It did appear that several candidates could not obtain access to the power point presentation in a timely manner but I would say that was on the candidate to communicate that issue to cprtrainingpro.

I thought Autumn. did an incredible job with communication leading up to the class.

I think the class curriculum was great.

She did her best to complete the course within the specified timeline.

That said, the course outline did not allow enough time for breaks.  Adults can only maintain a certain level of attention before needing a break.

Yes , we did break from lecture to activities which does help but I think scheduled defined breaks need to be scheduled and allowed.

Finally, I would strongly recommend that the Company ensure that all (all) manikins and any other tools be in pristine working condition before every class.

If a training tool is non-operational , it needs to be replaced. If the training tool requires batteries, fresh batteries should be installed on a pm schedule to ensure the training tool is 100 percent functional for every class.

As it was pointed out in class to us as potential instructors, people pay a lot of money to take a class and expect all training tools to function.  We as instructor candidates should expect the same.

Autumn needs to identify someone on the team to take on some of these duties like pms for manikins.  I also think this course should have two instructors available during the skills performance section.

Overall, Autumn did an incredible job with our group of 10 individuals with skills ranging from being able to perform instructor duties to individuals that should rethink this path.

I would defiantly recommend Autumn and cprtrainingpro going forward and would use her services for any additional training I may need and/or require.

Best regards,
