After searching for a nail salon for over a year since I moved to Fremont. They are very skilled and super patient. & certainly did understand and did it precise. So even after 2. 5 weeks of nail growth, the growth is not too noticeable. Will definitely be back next week for a refill on my full set. I absolutely love the end result.< /Review>

They are a bit casual, but price, service and flexibility of them working around my time is unbeatable.  They could use a better nail design expert and maybe a bit more message on Pedi.  However the application of nailcolor is long lasting and I don't even use gloves to do dishes.<//Text>

< Review>
They are a bit casual, but price, service and flexibility of them working around my time is unbeatable.  They could use a better nail design expert and maybe a bit more message on Pedi.  However the application of nailcolor is long lasting and I don't even use gloves to do dishes.</Review>

< review>
This has to be the worst experience I have ever had with a dental office. I have had temporaries on since October and have had to go in multiple times to get them glued back on. I’ve spent $4000 on my dental care and still have not received a phone call or email to get my permanents. Last night one of the temporaries cracked for the 4th time and this time there is bleeding and severe pain and when I called this morning at 9 am when they opened all they could say is that there is not a doctor in the office today. I had to ask if it was possible to go to a different location because I am in a lot of pain and the receptionist said she had to ask her supervisor. She then tells me to call Felicita (didn’t even offer to transfer me) which I did and they said they were completely booked but that she could see that San Marcos had openings and she would transfer me. I am on hold with San Marcos who clearly has openings but says they cannot see me because I am not one of their patients so to call the Escondido location for service! This is ridiculous spending this much time calling different locations when I have spent a large amount of money at this place and still have not been treated with any good service! But they are surely on top of having their financial department call me to collect $400 on the work that has still not been finished! My tooth is still bleeding but I guess it’s my problem. I will 100% be switching dentists once my work is complete!</review>

<text>I cracked my molar tooth and needed to be seen right away. They fit me in at this Escondido location even though I live in Rancho San Diego. I'm very thankful that they accommodated me in or I would had had a painful , terrible 3 day weekend.
I will admit I was so scared and had sooo much anxiety about the procedure.
The welcoming front desk, the very polite x-ray technician , caring dental assistant and  very professional Dentist , Dr Mehta,  I automatically felt at ease and well taken care of through it all.
They explained everything clearly and we're very sweet to me through it all when it came to the tough part. Thank you all once again. .< /text>< pics>

My dentist is the best Dr. Shawn Chadha was patient, understand, and does really good work. He has a great since of humor and I am happy my last dentist quit taking my insurance, other wise I would never found this place. The best part about this doctor I feel he is very straight to the point in telling you what you need done and what to expect worse come to worse.</text>

Went in for a deep cleaning because supposedly I had periodontal disease. They did the left side first and the right side would be treated 2 days later. 24 hours after having a deep cleaning on my left side, one of my tooth was profusely bleeding from the gums. I went in the next day to let them know and the dentist was clueless why this was happening. First they wanted to extract another tooth because supposedly it was infected, then they suggested that I might have a blood disorder. They also tried to stop the bleeding with me bitting down on some tea bags. When nothing worked they recommended I go to the ER to get some blood tests. After sitting there for more than an hour and the dentist basically guessing on what to do I decided to go to urgent care. I had blood test done there which all came out normal and the doctor suggested to go to see another dentist immediately for a second opinion. Finally decided to see a new dentist the same day who a family member recommended. The new dentist was horrified with what he saw. He said that my gum fibers and tissue were damaged from the deep cleansing. He applied a brown paste on my gums and teeth to stop the bleeding within a few minutes. He also prescribed penicillin to prevent infection for the next 7 days. My new dentist basically said that the first dentist was treating me for periodontal disease when I should have been treated for gingivitis. This was a really bad experience. I couldn’t eat solid foods for almost a whole week which resulted in me losing weight. I was unable to go to work for a couple days because of the bleeding and pain. To make matters worst they charged my insurance and I for this poorly dental job done. If I could give this place a zero I would.<//text>

Amazing. Absolutely amazing. Great attention to detail and made me feel so comfortable. They laid out the plan for my dental work and were completely transparent. I had dental work done and I felt 0 pain. I walked in and pain and left feeling better. Office manager Elizabeth was very helpful. ALL the RDA were great Pam was amazing Doctor love was great. Definitely looking forward to coming back.</Review>

I had a dental emergency . My dentist didn’t feel my issue was an emergency so I called around. I found this dentist at bright now dental. I got in the same day . The care and Covid 19 precautions were exceptional. My dentist made me feel so calm and was very caring and gentle . The assistant was so sweet too. My 4 hour dental appt left me exhausted and crying and very angry at my old dentist. The dr and assistant made this horrible dental emergency as good as it could be . I loved them so much I fired my old dentist and will come to them from now on.</Text>

DO NOT COME HERE. I waited for 3 hours and the dentist asked if I had something to do in the area while I waited for her and said it takes really long for new patients... horrible experience, save your time and don’t come here.</Text>

The Dr. has a great chair side manner and works efficiently with showing care for his patients. The assistant (has a slight foreign accent) made me so nervous, she was constantly out of her seat during the procedure and at a time when she should’ve been using the suction hose to get water out of my throat (I had nitrogen for my anxiety so has to breath through my nose)she left and I have to swallow and hit the Dr.s drill and now I have a cut under my tongue that hurts like crazy and didn’t sleep much due to the pain. I will continue to go back as I love this place but I will not allow her to work on me ever again.</review><resp>None</resp>< rating>

SO NICE & KIND.  They were direct and informative...  Yet very patient and understanding.  WE LOVE coming to this Dental Office.  They take the time to make sure we're cared for, understand our plan for dental health, and provide us every option/opportunity to help meet our needs.  WE CAN'T BE HAPPIER.</text>

It's a great feeling when you walk into your dental facility and the staff not only know your name but they make you feel as comfortable as possible! They're very friendly and are always smiling. They go above and beyond to bring a great experience to everyone. Thanks to Jose and Dr. Radke for making the the fillings I needed a breeze!! Never had any issues here. I would definitely recommend Bright Now Dental! To anyone who needs work done ✅<//Review>

My family and I have been going to Bright Now Dental for years. Every worker there is so nice and make you feel so comfortable.  We especially like Irma, Ana, Monica, and Mayra. They go above and beyond to help you. I would definitely recommend going here for your dental needs...</Review>

< Review>
Everyone is very nice but I went for a filling turns out I didn't need one. One dentist said another thing and it was the wrong tooth. It turned out I needed now a Crown on my upper tooth #13 when the first dentist said he could do a filling. Makes me think if I should take my business elsewhere. I am going every 3 months for my cleanings and updating my Dental plan for the upcoming year and it should be better but I want a dentist where everyone on the same page and they listen to their patients. Not feeling Bright Dental anymore. Will get a 2nd opinion if I can get a regular filling on number 13th when the first Dentist was going to do it but this Dentist insisted on a Crown.<//Review>

I went in for a single chipped tooth. I ended up being told I needed three crowns. Dr. Loff insisted that I needed the expensive ones for durability.  It took them a very long time, six months,  to get them done because one of them never got ordered and twice they messed up the molds and the crown didnt fit. Dr Loff was very rude to his staff and then started becoming increasingly rude to me. So much so that I literally left in tears  and pain once and refuse to go back for further treatment because he sawed into my temp crown wurh ZERO numbing medication and was so sadistic and mean. My husband was with me and said hey are you doing that without numbing it? He flung his chair back and stormed off. He came back and jabbed me so hard in multiple places with such force I had pain for 6 weeks after and it got infection. The thing was he had such anger when he did it too! Also, two of the three crowns have chipped and I am now in debt up to my ears with them and have two jagged crowns cutting my mouth and can't get them fixed even though I have 3000 in debt with them.  I HIGHLY recommend if you must use Bright Now dental you choose another location! Run from Dr. Loff.<//text>

<Text>I came in thinking my experience was going to be like the first time(which wasn't pleasant) i was kind of nervous about it because i knew I wasn't in a good place with my teeth. but there is a new staff that's there i think. Very good at multi tasking, kept it real which i needed. And made the process fast and easy. Maricruz i think thats her name the dental hygienist was great! Ask for her she does a great job. There were some moments when the dental nurse (she's the best with doing xrays) put some pressure on my mouth at times which made me uncomfortable but it was my fault because i didn't say anything which led me to move. The dentest Dr. Shawn Chadna (which i suggest he's great)  did give me some good advice and told me if that happens again just to raise my left arm and that will let them know to stop. So there you go. Great team even though it did look like there was a call out or a shortage of hours they did great and worked well together.

Poor dental care, stay away!  I went in for a cleaning, exam and x-rays and they lied to me, telling me that I better get all of this dental work done because I had big problems in my mouth that would get worse.  I knew that I have no problems in my mouth and the cleaning was the worst cleaning I have ever received.  Bright Now Dental are amateurs who are not very good at dentistry but are very good at trying to sell people expensive dental work that they do not need.  They apparently only hire dentist and  hygienists who are willing to defraud patients.  This company is a scam.  I realized it but many people probably do not.  Be careful!  How are places like this even allowed to operate in our city?  It seems criminal.  Beware.< /Text>

<Review>Very kind, caring, and funny Indian doctor who explained everything she was going to do (I was terrified), and actually was able to make me laugh while my mouth was being drilled.  HOWEVER...  the staff was very sub-par.  Exorbitant fees, way overpriced.  They don't answer questions properly, only vague answers that don't help at all.  They are not respectful of your time.  I usually had to wait about 15-20 min. but last time it was 45+ min, then I walked out.  They NEVER answer the phone, even the direct line.  I was ALWAYS transferred to the emergency line, and when I pointed this out, the person only said "Well, I'm not sure how that could be," in a very vague tone of voice.</Review><rate>2<//rate>< gmap_id>

UPDATE JULY 23 2019
Since June 26 it's been a battle to get a set of retainers that fit. Today, July 23rd was suppose to be the day I get a replacement but lo and behold, they're not ready. 8 weeks after getting the initial impression done for my first set, and 3 weeks after the second impression and I still do not have retainers that fit. Save yourself the trouble and go to a private office. Bright Now is the worst franchise I've ever had the mispleasure of dealing with.

This review is going to be all over the place, as I've two years of complaints.

Bright Now Dental was okay for a while. Until I became aware that their Orthodontal staff is overworked and spread much too thin. They are visibly tired and this affects their work severely. I expect a dentist to be just as excited about getting back to a healthier smile as I am. I always feel rushed when I go in there and I feel like a stranger almost every time. In the 2 + years that I've been going, my general dentist and orthodontist have changed 3 times EACH. My most recent visit I dealt with a Dr. Franco and I did not like her one bit. She was cold and offered no insight to what I can do to improve my oral hygiene. She asked me once if I had any concerns, but did not seem too interested whether or not I actually had any. On my xray, there is visible bone loss on my upper right side that she never addressed or mentioned. And my lower gumline is in desperate need of attention due to severe gum recession from braces and years of crowding. BUT THIS WAS NEVER MENTIONED. After she cleaned my teeth, she walked off without thanking me for coming in and asking me if I had any questions. Every dentist I've ever been too ALWAYS thanks the patient after they are done treatment and ask if they need anything else. If Franco's your dentist, or you're thinking about making her your's, I would reconsider.
Additionally, I've had 2 appointments in the last year cancelled with no notice from the dental staff. I've shown up for my appointment only to be told the person in charge of the instruments had an emergency and another, more recent appointment on June 8, where I showed up 10 minutes before my time, only to be met with locked doors and no staff. They claimed to have called me and left several voice mails, but I never recieved a call from them. I told the receptionist, Jenna I think was her name, that I'm fed up with the service I have been recieving from their clinic and that I'll be finding a new one. She said, "That's fine" This is a very good way to run a business. Tell your customers that it's fine if they take their business elsewhere and don't address the problems at hand.
During my last appointment, a man was in the waiting room filling out paperwork to be seen. I imagine he was on a lunch break, as he was smartly dressed. He finished his stack of paperwork and took it to Jenna, (I think that was her name. She's new to me.) the receptionist, only to be told he had MORE to fill out. He reacted very aggressively, swearing and being generally unkind. He then left, only for the receptionists and 1 other waiting room patient to begin bad mouthing him. I don't care how rude someone is to you, you do not talk ill of a patient in front of other patients. It's grossly unprofessional. This office, in Escondido Promenade is in need of some serious customer service training and they need to realize that we are people, not dollar signs.< /Review>

<rate>3</rate><Text>I had an emergency appointment today at Bright Now Dental and I was treated so well. I never have been seen there before. I was in pain with what turned out to be an absess and this Dental Office immediately helped me.
I didn't have to wait long to get the emergency appointment. On the phone and then off to the dentist. It was that fast! And I desperately needed it to be that fast as I have serious commitments tomorrow through Sunday.
Once there, I was received by an amazing office staff, very efficient and the office was extremely clean and modern.
I've honestly never seen an X-ray machine like theirs. Very high tech.
Got in very fast and efficiently.
Wonderful dentist came in unfortunately he had laryngitis and had to whisper and I don't hear very well so the dental assistant spoke on his behalf.
Turned out I had an abscess under my crown.
I was told to see a specialist so I went to their other location in San Marcos who has a endodontis there.
I’m editing now so anyone who goes to Bright Now can avoid the San Marcos location!<//Text>< Pictures>

Ok, so I originally left a review in 2016 when I 1st took my kids in. The staff was great. Friendly, helpful and most importantly, KNOWLEDGEABLE. The Dr’s are still good ones, doing their jobs to the best of their abilities (they can only do so much with your teenage kids teeth/mouth in the office. Not like they can force them to brush and floss every meal). What I believe to be the problem here is, the front desk staff. Constantly changing, not always knowing what or how to do the paperwork. You make a payment with the finance office then go into an appointment and they try to charge you again because they don’t know the system so all they see is that you owe money, not that you’ve made payment arrangements with finance. It’s annoying. Another thing, appointments are really easy to schedule at the beginning but good luck going into your monthly ortho exam/rubberband change. Because it’s difficult to get your monthly scheduled, it prolongs the time they told the insurance it would take, making you pay additional fees. My advice, DO NOT come here for orthodontics.<//review>

There is a new head dentist at this location, she's a female,  and she's fantastic. I have 8 cavities that were missed by my previous dentist and Dr. Rebecca Lang caught them all right before they turned into root canals. Not only did she do excellent  work on the repair,  but the office manager set up financing for me to help with  the large expense up front. The one thing and for me the most important  was that I did not feel any of the needles she had to use. She uses a trick that is great for those weary of them. Very talented dentist, and a great staff to help. When you can still write a great review while your jaw is in throbbing pain, you know you can trust my 5 stars.< /Review>

Went in for an Root Canal treatment with Nasrin Khajeh and her assistant Jose and they took care of me right away, made sure I was comfortable during the whole procedure. Everyone there is very nice, the place is very clean and most importantly they help find an affordable payment plan option for me as well. I recommend this place to anyone who needs any kind of dental service!</text>

<time>1378353382259<//time><text>This a review for the location in Escondido on Felicita.  I had a friend that went to this location who had the same kind of experience I had.
One of the worst dental experiences I've had in my life.  I have insurance through my work but wasn't enough to cover all their extra fees and services they tell you that you need.  Once they tell you how much it will cost they then offer you to apply for the Care Credit to cover their fees.  Once they find out you qualify for a certain amount they start with you need a deep cleaning which insurances don't cover, oh you also need antibiotics.  Your insurance doesn't cover it so it's $100 a pill, but since you're a customer we will do it for $50 a pill so it will only be a $100, don't worry if you don't have the money just use your Care Credit.  The whole experience reminds me when you bring your car in for something and they come back saying you need this, this and this.

After a year, it seemed like every time I went in, there were always "additional charges".  Then the time I showed up to a locked office, and a phone call after my appointment time to cancel my appointment was very unprofessional.

Today, I had made an appointment to look at and treat a old filled tooth that had cracked off.  When I showed up for my 8am appointment,  they couldn't find my appointment.   When I pressed to be seen anyway, "I'm only the periodontist" was the excuse I recieved.

No organization. No one except the office manager can do anything.  And a continual turn  over of staff, except the office manager.< /text>

It's nice to go to an office with familiar faces, where the staff knows you by name and vice versa. My family and I are always treated with professionalism each and every visit from Luis Fajardo, Erma the Ortho Tech, & the ladies at the front desk. I left my dentist (private practice) of over 10 yrs for a location closer to home-- Luis Fajardo, the Office Manager, made a very hard decision, easy to make. I would have given 5 stars, but because Luis is no longer with the company, therefore I rated them with only 4 stars.</Text>

But, the orthadonist team made me feel welcome with a calming enviorment for the clients. For example, starting conversations and constantly checking if the we need of their assistance.

If i could give this place a zero i would. My wife and i had high hopes with this dental scam location. We started going to bright now dental in escondido next to panera about 4 years ago. Let me start off by telling everybody that its obvious this place is doing some form of marketing technique in the last week there have been about 5 reviews simple and basic. Maybe the company decided to switch from yelp (since their ratings suck there) to try to fool every one on google. When we started going to that dental office there was a female manager then a male manager then a hispanic manager now we go in and their is a female manager (turn over is too high). Started off with a middle eastern dentist (can remember her name) she was horrible and very rude. Then a petite Dr came in i believe her name was Dr. Lana or something like that she was great one of the reasons we kept going now they have another middle eastern Dentist. Believe her name is Dr. M  extremely rude condescending and slow. Longest 2 hours of my life for what she said was "a quick small filling". We've met 3 diff cleaning ladies 2 of them were great but the new one there, Danielle is all about upsale, upsale, upsale. Makes me wonder if they have a quota to meet. The new manager doesn't seem to know what shes doing, the front staff girls are always on there phone dressed unprofessionally and talking about their own personal life. Long story short this company really needs to learn how to keep staff and hire good experienced dentists. Not new dentist that are fresh out of school. Will be taking my insurance and business elsewhere. Where we don't feel like a number sign.< /text>

<Review>Awful experience. I was on my lunch break and went in to get a chipped tooth fixed. they were more than a half hour late to call me into the room. Once I got called back they did x-rays and sat me in another room for another 20 minutes. when the doctor finally came in i told her what i was there for and asked for pricing before she did the procedure. she said she would send in the office manager to discuss it. i sat there for another 30 mins and finally just got up to walk out to go back to work. i recieved a call about 15 mins after that asking where i had gone. i explained to him i was there for an hour and a half and got nothing accomplished and i needed to get back to work. he was apologetic but it didnt fix anything it was unacceptable. then 3 weeks later i got a bill for a "comprehensive oral exam" which nothing about the exam was comprehensive. im not even sure you can call it an exam. very poor time management i will not be returning and do not reccoment this place< /Review></record></dataset><record>

But the pain of the needle going into my jaw was the most painful feeling ever this was not my first wisdom tooth pulled and my last surgery made me feel like saying hey let's do this again another time and that was a mom and pops shop

A female doctor with a broken leg performed my surgery she struggled so bad to pull my wisdom tooth first she was so brute to shove the needle in my mouth so hard I started shaking from the pain instantly after that they gave me a few minutes for the stuff to kick in they came back they put a block in my mouth to bite on but while she was sitting trying to pull on my tooth she starts to wiggle my jaw to the point it felt like it was going to break off I had to tell her you are hurting me instead of pulling more she instead uses my jaw bone as leverage to break chunks of tooth off instead i felt she did not have the proper body mechanics to position her strength correctly she was sitting and hanging on my jaw this
rookie work felt like i was at barber college style dental group I assumed instantly that she was in training anyways it's been almost a yr now my jaw side has spasms and a lump In my jaw bone that comes and goes where the tooth was pulled
I have never felt that way in my life I will never go back</Review></record>

<Text>Dr Pang is the best. I came to her when I needed my first pair of prescriptions and she    perfect in my prescription. Also guiding me in how to wear eye glasses. Today, I decided to add contacts for my everyday lifestyle and she was so patiently  in making sure I left with the right prescription by testing me twice and changing the right prescription when I left her office. I don’t trust any other doctor when in comes to my eyes. I have recommended  family members and friends to come and see her and everyone loves her.

Thank you Dr. Pang for your kindness, your patience and the wonderful service you give us in making us feel comfortable with our new eye vision!<//Text>< pictures>

Diane Tran is the best eye optometrist I have had the pleasure of experiencing. Her professionalism, charisma, and knowledge are superior. She makes sure you are comfortable throughout the eye exam and constantly checks on your comfort level. She makes you feel relaxed and guides you through all eye exams. She explained my prescription with thoroughness . I can tell she loves her profession. I felt uplifted by her positive energy. Thank you Diane Tran. I am so thrilled Diane Tran is my optometrist.< /Review>

This was my first appointment with Dr. Pang and I found the whole experience very positive. The appointment was easy to book online and the location was convenient with good parking and easy access inside Target. Dr. Pang is very friendly and made me feel very comfortable with all the Covid safety measures. The eye exam was extremely thorough and Dr. Pang explained the purpose behind each test procedure and the results. She addressed all my concerns, answered my questions, and gave me a good sense of what to expect as my eyes age. I left feeling that I had just met a caring, highly skilled optometrist and a wonderful person!< /Text>

<Text>Dr. Alice Pang took her time with me during my eye exam. She noticed something in my eye when we were reviewing the pictures, so she had me take a few more pictures to make sure it wasn't anything concerning. She answered all of my questions, which is the main reason why I continue going to her.
When she called me in, she checked my temperature and had me wash my hands. Everything was sanitized multiple times! After my exam, I went to the front to choose out my glasses. The woman who helped me (I don't remember her name) had chosen a few for me. She had great taste because I went with one of the ones she chose! Thank you Target Optical! I will be back next year!<//Text><resp>None<//resp></record>

This was my first time seeing Dr. Tran.  She explained each test and the reason for it.  She also answered all my questions and took time when fitting my contacts.  I haven't had this kind of service in years.   I know she has become my lifetime eye doctor.   In fact, I even purchased contacts and glasses - something I never do.  I usually leave with prescription and order them online.   Thank you Dr. Tran.   I will see you next year!  And I will be telling all my friends/family about you.<//Review>

<Review>The ladies in the front were helpful in letting me know what my insurance covered and what procedures would be an extra cost during my eye exam. Dr. Pang explained my retinal scans well and answered my questions about Lasik in a very understandable way. They are efficient and informative, with a comfortable atmosphere in the clinic. It's also a bonus that they're inside Target so I can continue my errands all in one place!< /Review>< Pictures>

Dr. Pang was quite thorough and didn't seem rushed.  For an eye exam that included retina photos took about 1/2 hour.

Her and her staff were quite pleasant and took their time to satisfactorily answer my many questions.

I've been looking for a new optometrist and will be a continuing patient of Dr. Pang in the future.<//Text>

<text>Dr. Pang is a kind, and caring professional.  My visit with her at the Target Optical center was the BEST eye exam visit I've had thus far!

<review>I have been a patient of Dr. Pang for about three years now. Every visit has been a positive experience. I keep returning to her because she appears to genuinely care about her patients and is always very professional. She asks a lot of questions to fully understand your concerns and she takes the time to explain everything. I have recommended her to family and friends and they have had the same experience. Thanks Dr. Pang.<//review>< Pictures>

She’s the only dr. I’ve ever had, that cared to take the extra time to notice details that might be life altering. Nobody ever cared to tell me if I had signs of something that could be serious.... and I get routine yearly exams ever since 2000.<//review>

Dr. Pang is very detailed.  I had my eye exam with her and a problem office visit.  She explains everything so you'll understand it.</text>

<text>Second time visiting. First time was a flop. This time was better. Service is good and friendly and attentive.

Biggest issue is the price relative to the quality. But the star of the show is always the sauce. At this place the sauce needs work...it's ok but not bomb like other places.

One great thing is they have PLENTY of screens AND they show all local games so that's a huge bonus!

Overall, if you need a quick fix this is a decent spot so stop by< /text>< Pictures>

First time trying the food. Had medium Cajun, garlic butter, and lemon pepper shrimp. It was all good, and maybe next time I will not order so much. 5 pounds with potatoes and corn is a bit much but good.<//text>

Butter garlic made me never want to eat another shrimp again. The other flavors are ok but unless you want an overpowering butter bowl with 20 cloves of garlic, choose either of the other two flavors< /Review>

<Text>Excellent cajun seafood restaurant, better than Claws since it's right in our backyard!  Service comes first at this restaurant and you can tell the staff are well-trained so kudos to the manager!  They checked up on us many times throughout our dinner and were very accommodating, shout out to Jasmine and Sophia for taking care of us!  Food came out very fast and was delicious, we ordered the stinkin combo which came with 3lbs of shrimp, crawfish, clams and mussels in the mild stinkin special sauce.  The atmosphere and decor is very warm and modern with alot of Samsung flat screen TVs everywhere so you won't miss that game!  We will definitely be coming back!< /Text><user_id>113537564188400241357</user_id>< rate>

My first visit. Food was good, beer was cold. It is a cool little  place. However, service was severely lacking, it needs to be improved.
Started with one server, then finished with someone else ( no one told us). I kept looking for the first one to get the check after eating, thinking the other server was helping.  I just had to figure out that she took over. I finally had to ask for the check.<//text>

Wife ate some bad seafood, got her sick and for it being empty at the time of my visit you'd assume you'd be the center of attention however that was not the case. Took forever to get service once our food was brought to our table.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Huacatala 🤮 it is grim all the fat that the shrimp and potatoes are all watery and the taste is not good to save the raw shrimp very badly and to order to take them they give them in open plastic volsa they all threw me back I do not return I do not return taste.😡

(Original)
Huacatala 🤮 esta asguerosos todo el grasero gue le ponen a los camarones y las papas todas aguadas  y el savor no es bueno  save muy mal los camarones crudos y para ordenar para llevar los dan en volsa plastica abiertos todos se me tiraron ya no regreso no me gusto.😡< /text>

Went in to get a drink with my grandma. We were the only ones there. Ordered our drinks, took them 30 mins! After they made it, they never called it out. The lady and the guy sat there flirting instead. Lady said that she forgot. After waiting, the drinks were all wrong. We were so mad at waiting we just wanted to leave. Even saw another lady complain about her drink as well during this time. Went home to poor my drink out, it was so gross.</Text>

The staff are great, fast, friendly and efficient. Tim, Mariel and everyone else that we meet in the morning are great. They treat you like family calling you by name if you are a regular customer. The place is always busy especially in the morning.

Maybe a tad early on Christmas, but who isn't?  Always a pleasure going into a Starbucks that's clean, fast, and friendly and they even really know your name!  Can sometimes be too busy, but always worth the wait.  If youre in a hurry a classic cup of brewed coffee is the fastest way to get in and out and you can doctor it up however you'd like... win win!<//Text>

<Text>RUDE RUDE AND RUDE! Rude service from a barista who thought I wouldn't notice she put regular milk in my frappe just because I also wanted whipped cream. I even told her i wanted coconut milk, and I knew she was going to ignore my request when she asked if I wanted whipped cream still. She doesn't know if I was lactose intolerant but willing to pay a small personal price (was MORE than a small personal price yesterday) for the whipped cream or if it went against my religious beliefs. Starbucks needs to hire honest workers who deserve jobs not lazy high school students.

Barista was kinda chubby and pretty with dark hair and fair skin working yesterday 12/21/2018 at 1pm, so watch out for her if your drink is more complex than the usual order. I'm surprised Starbucks doesn't enforce the "customer is always right" policy when it comes to their own personal order that they will be drinking.< /Text>< pics>

If you go early morning its great service but around the second or third shift (~9am) they get two employees busting their ass and one or two more employees that either do a lax job or not working at all. Today I watched a girl (I assume she was the manager?) Just take her time walking from the back room to the floor not really helping any of the other employees. She took someones order but then severly took her time with it. Probably about the third time Ive seen this too. Makes the line go to the door and orders take about 10 min longer than they need to.</Review>

Terrible service. Person ahead in line  ordered about 20 coffees. 4 people working. One cashier and one barista. Instead of taking person aside and bringing another person up to help. the barista spent his time helping person figure out their order and put making coffees on hold. Another person standing around watching. I understand order was large but could have organized better< /review>

I've been here twice and received excellent customer service. On my second visit, a panel underneath my front bumper got loose and was dangling and scraping the road. Diamond Auto Body was able put it back in for me free of charge since it was super minor work. Super friendly staff, clean facility. I was very comfortable here both times and this will be my first choice auto body shop in the future.< /review>

Bad communication when I'm there or during phone call. In person they just leave doing their own thing and don't communicate to follow them or anything expecting we know what to do or to follow them or not. Needs better communication with clients and not discourteous attitude. Other than that service was fast and great.<//text>

Took my car in for missing the front bumper due to an accident. The staff were extremely kind professional and accommodating with . Even though I called often to check in. The work is the best and now my car looks just as good if not better than before the accident. I've been to different places to get my car fixed and had they by far are the best. Will go here in the future when I fix my other car. Thank you so much you guys.< /Text>

<text>Run don't walk away, not sure the owner knows what's going on in his business.  They build AAA for a new part, used a used part, it went bad and caused over a thousand dollars in damage, had extra work done wish we had used a check to pay for the extra work.

<Text>The most pleasant experience pertaining to automobiles that I have ever had. They fixed the damage to my vehicle within a week (vehicle looks new again) and were extremely professional, prompt, and kind. Not that I want to wreck my car again, but if I did, I know I’d be going back here for the repairs.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>I would give more stars if I could! Took my car in to have some work done, and they did a great job. Aside from the top quality work, I also appreciate their dedication and honesty to costumer service. Not to mention that Arthur and Peter provided me with regular updates and had my car looking like new.

<Review>Hello everyone
I’m taking the time to write this review because this body shop did an awesome job with my BMW.  I’ve never seen so much good detail done to a car.  The bottom line you want to get your car done right take your car to Diamond Auto Body.... 5 star service!

I wanna give a special thanks to Mary,  really showed a lot of professionalism.

My 4 year old son thought it would be a good idea to spray paint my husband's truck black. It was only a couple spots but it still was obvious. I took the truck to diamond and they had it fixed within 20min. Yiu cant tell there was ever black paint on it. Diamond auto body was polite, professional and knowledgeable. We will forever be customers of Diamond auto body and will continue to refer them to evwryone< /Text>

They were 1K less expensive than my preferred auto body shop, they completed the repair job before their estamated time of completion. I'm at this time satisfied with the auto body work they did on my vehicle.<//text>

I'm very impressed!
I've been to a few places to get random repairs done to my vehicle and these guys did an amazing job and on top of that the price was really reasonable to fix my Subi.Thank you very much!!!
Also I'm pretty sure with as many careless drivers on the road now a days.You can bet I will bring my cars there every time.Thanks again Danny and your team!</review>

Great work doesn't happen quickly.  I would rather have a job take a couple extra days than not be done well.  Diamond does fantastic work, better than factory!</review>

<Text>It is hard to find a company whom you can trust to give excellent service and will not cheat you. We have been fortunate enough to find Diamond Auto Body. My husband and I have gone to Diamond Auto Body for three separate occasions - once for a new windshield, and twice for auto body work. They have gone above and beyond, coordinating with the car rental company and the insurance company. Besides the excellent customer service we received there, the work on our vehicles was impeccable. We will not trust our vehicles to any other auto body company.

I must add - the three cars they have worked on are a 2001 Ford F150, a 2005 Scion XB, and a 2014 Toyota Rav 4 - all of which do not even total $75,000. I was still treated with the same respect as the people with the fancy cars.

I want to end with an observation that speaks to their customer service - the other day I saw an accident not too far away from the business. I saw one of the employees helping a gentleman push his car to the side of the street away from main traffic. I don't know too many companies who would do that, especially in the heat.</Text></record>

< review>
I took my car to Diamond Auto body after my brand new 2017 Audi was rear-ended on the Friant off-ramp of HWY 41.  After getting hit, I had a lot of bad feelings about getting the car repaired because the car was brand new, and I had felt that nobody would be able to fix it correctly. I was totally wrong. The guys at Diamond Auto Body had my car back to factory-looking conditions. After my car was repaired here, my dad had some body issues with his car and he went here. His car came out of the shop looking brand-new like nothing ever happened.
I would recommend these guys to anyone, and I will be bringing my car back here for any issues I have in the future. They get things done right the first time around.< /review>

Waited 2 months to get my car in this shop to repair a scratch on my back bumper and trunk. Took a week and a half to get it done. Never called me to update on the progress. I finally walked in to find out the status of my car. Told they were still waiting on a part but would be done by 4:30. Here I sit at 4:55 waiting for them to finish "washing my car". And now my bill is $200 more than quoted. I'm really disappointed.< /review>

I walked in and immediately Rodrigo noticed and asked if he can help me. He was very polite, assertive and friendly. He was quick and showed me around with other products and answered all my questions. I wouldn’t hesitate to come back.< /review>

Very slimy service. They take advantage of people who aren't informative of phones and phone plans. Go to an actual Verizon Retailer instead.</review>

My worts experience at this location.  The manager telling Brandon to find a way to sell a table or a new phone to me, he got by providing me the incorrect information, I called Customer service and was told to return my product that still in the box at no extra charge. Brandon is a terrible sales person for customers he sell mor that what you really need and charge a little extra for the monthly payment for my device, please check deals and prices before you go here or use another location. Please put a closer attention to this reseller. I am sure you will get a lot of complaints for the way thy do sales.< /text>

I went here to buy a phone. The phone offered to me was 79.99, which someone had two more charges made the phone cost 140 something dollars. When I asked about this,  the only employee there told me that this was normal and everyone gets charged with this. I have used Verizon for years and this did not make sense to me. When discussing this , the employee told me that I didn't need to buy from thier store. I went to a Verizon store in Downtown LA and they only made me pay for the phone and a 30 dollar activation fee. So I would say something is going on in this store.< /Text>

The employees were friendly especially Iliana who was such a great help.

After several attempts it was time to move forward with a new phone. They provided all the options and made sure I was getting the best deal.

<text>Honestly extremely disappointed. I went to upgrade my phone and I had to go back to the store 5+ on different days. I first went to get the new galaxy note 10+ 5g and i was sold the regular note 10+. I went back to see if they can switch it out since I was sold the wrong one and they said they needed the manager to do the switch. I went back when the manager was there and he said they are out of stock and will order a new one and it'll be in store on Wednesday next week. I said okay and came back Wednesday and they still didn't have the order. I went back the next day and I was told the manager would come in at 12 and he didnt show. I have work at 2pm so I couldn't stay. Fortunately they allowed my girlfriend to do the swap while I was at work. However they messed up putting the screen protector and it has a smudge. They said if I could come back next week and they will replace it. I went back and guess what, they still didnt have the screen protector. I am still using the one with the smudge as you can't see it as much when it's on. Then a week later they call me saying they messed up and I'm still being charged for the previous phone and my bill goes up by over 100$ when they correct their mistake. Not only did my bill go up but I had a 36 month payment plan that changed to 24. When I asked if they can change it back they said I had to call customer service and ask them. This place although the employees are fairly nice are utterly useless. They need to get rid of these employees or retrain them. Only reason why it's not 1 star is because they were nice and the customer service on the phone is one of the best I've ever dealt with.< /text>< Pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Amazing customer appreciation at the Verizon store in Sylmar, the staff found me 2 promotions I didn’t even know I had and saved me over $1000, I had spoken to someone at location in Panorama and they didn’t even let me know how much I could save but thanks to these nice gentle they really took care of me and my family. Thank you very Manny for taking a good look at my account and being patient with us. I recommend this Sylmar location and ask for Manny he’ll make sure to dive in and find any and all savings they have to offer.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I purchased my phone at another Verizon store and came to the Verizon store in Sylmar. Carlos, Stacy and Mike were quick to help me and helped me get everything back to normal. They even hooked me up with a new sim. Very grateful for these guys and anyone who has Verizon should stop by.< /Review>< rate>

Though the manager and couple sales people are nice, stay away from Victra. My friend was charged fees that she wasn't aware of. Three days later, on the returned she was cheated out of 29.99 on the refund. It took 2 hours for the return and re install the previous plan. God knows what bill she will get from Verizon. Dishonest customer service kills any business.</text>

They are good salesman but not honest at all. They tell you they are giving you things for free then charge you for them. Oh and they don't show you the receipt till the end and still lie to you about it. My fault I didn't check my receipts but that's because I truly thought I was dealing with an honest girl.<//Review>

DO NOT COME TO THIS STORE!!

All the reviews are 100% accurate. They will lie to you about everything , add unauthorized items to your invoice and account. If you try to return something , they will make you jump through hoops to make you give up. Unless you're buying something , they won't bother spending a minute with you. Piece of advice go to another store. There are plenty of other stores near by that isn't owned by A Wireless (name of company this store belongs to). I ended up going to the new store in San Fernando and was actually treated like a human being instead of a cash cow that they tried to milk for every penny I had.</Review>

Do yourself a favor and go to another store. All these "A Wireless" stores are the same. They force you to buy $150 worth of accessories along with bunch of other stuff without telling you. They'll lie straight to your face. If you try to return something,  they'll become hostile and then it'll cost you an arm and leg. Worst experience ever.< /Review>

This was perhaps the worst experience I've had with an "authorized retailer". I called Verizon's Customer Service and was told that I could return an unused tablet, which was still wrapped, and then these guys try to charge me almost $200 for returning it. But then I called customer service in from of the "district manager" (who was helping me) and then all of a sudden, he remembers that instead of charging me $200, he could give me a Hotspot for $10 more, or let me pick 2 accessories for my phone... go elsewhere if you can.<//review>

I had the very unpleasant experience of meeting with Eric Rodriguez (manager), Zytlaly Zamora (assistant manager), and Marvin Esperia (assistant salesman) at the Sylmar location on Foothill starting 10 days ago. I've already been at the store 4 times now, only to find out more and more complications and issues about changing my phone and number from another company to Verizon, and on top of that, finding out only today on the 4th try that it may not even work, after I already paid and just found out there is no reimbursement.

First, there is no disclosure about any possible complications.
Second, the manager Eric Rodriguez tells me that it is my fault that I didn't know about those possible complications (totally unprofessional, since they are supposed to be the ones giving the information, not the customer).
Third, they kick you out of the store so they don't have to deal with you or the problem anymore, since you already paid and there is no reimbursement.

HORRIBLE experience with them! They are just a bunch of thieves!< /text>

I am not knowledgeable of the many cell phone plans in the industry.

In error, I went to the Verizon Wireless retailer LA11D Sylmar, 13756 Foothill Boulevard, Sylmar, California, 91342.

As I prepared to travel outside of this country, I wanted to add money and extend the time of my prepaid plan so that the cellphone would not self-cancel the $90 on the account as I traveled outside the US.

I told the personnel in the Verizon Retail Center exactly what I wanted to do, they took the money, completed a transaction --

And the cellphone went dead.  I attempted to make a call.  No service.

"Maybe you can't get service in here," the manager told me.

I walked outside, attempted a call.  Dead cell phone.

I returned to the counter, asked the manager what had gone wrong.

Then the personnel discovered my cell phone operated on an AT&T prepaid plan.  Yes, incorrect company.  Incorrect retail center.

Yet they had taken my money and added the money to account that did not exist.

No account?  I asked the personnel to cancel the transaction and reset my dead cell phone.

"We didn't do anything to your cell phone."

"The phone functioned before I came in here."

"We don't know that."

I asked the store manager his name, Jhovany, he told me.  I asked for his card, he flipped a store card in my direction.  That ended the transaction.  The card he gave me did not have a name.

The name Jhovany Garcia-Chavez appears on the Sale Invoice print-out.

AT&T restored my cell phone service.  And adjusted the pre-paid plan to extend far beyond my return time to the US.

I will not return to that Retail Center.  I will tell others to avoid that Retail Center and Jhovany Garcia-Chavez. And this account will appear on the Google review for that Retail Center.

To others who read this review:  AT&T is very competent and courteous.< /review>

My friend Jack sings

"I loved a girl so sweet and so perfect
That all my life was put into a pearl
And shook with vigorous contempt
Like the diamond clear
Sunshine waves at cockel wash bay
And now all I do is moan"

He loves the sandwiches here so much and lives the staff.</text>

The concept is good who, doesn't love subway? But why is it so hard to wash hands after u handle money, instead they just grab a pair of gloves whit their dirty hands (making the gloves dirty, contaminated) and proceed to continue doing sandwiches. Marisol even got offended cuz i stop her from doing my sandwich when i spot her not washing her hands. Gross...tnx but no tnx.<//review>

Cesar works at the eaglerock location, he is so rude, zero costumer service. My son put his hand on the counter and touched the machine by accident and Cesar yelled at my son telling him not to touch anything. He is so rude. The worst costumer service there.<//Text>

So flavorless and bland. I remember this coming with a cream sauce & now the sauce is mainly oil & water. So disappointed. Most of this unfortunately will go in the trash. Save your money.<//review>

If you look inside the oven you can clearly see the giant blue flames of a gas oven. The margherita pizza is still pretty good, but really looks nothing like the image on the poster. The tomatoes and basil distribution could be more even, but the crust and flavor are good.< /review>< user_id>

<text>I came here for breakfast before my flight from Gate 32 in Terminal B.  My food was ready quickly.  I didn't know what "Italian Sausage + Egg + Cheese" on the menu meant, but it turned out to be a breakfast sandwich with those ingredients.  The sandwich was excessively hot, the bread was soggy, and it had barely any sausage on it at all... but it was delicious.  I can't explain why it was so good, but just trust me on this if you're in need of a quick breakfast in Terminal 2 before your flight.<//text><name>Doug Brown<//name><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

Official website says closes at 10:30, so does Google maps.  woman at register said they close at 10:30. But at 9:15 they said they weren't making any more pizzas. There was no line or back up.</review>

This was pretty solid pizza all around, if you're into more artisanal-style pies. We had the Portobello Mushroom and the Pancetta Pizza. Both were delicious.< /Review>

<Text>I loved this place went in with my Granddaughter and we each had our own personal pizza!!! 1st time was so great I went back with my guy and, on that night the kids pizza was made with no effort (blah... ) and my waitress /server lacked some of the skills required to be a success in the services industries. (Disapeard, hard to catch even when it was slow. By the Time she checked on our table everyone had finished eating except for the bad kids pizza which she did take back into the kitchen and brought another which was awsome however we had to take that one to go.
Overall.
Great food, usually great service, I would recomend it<//Text>< date>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Awful service, rude employee. Asked for gluten free crust. She handed me the pie and confirmed that it was the cauliflower crust. It wasn't. Horrible experience to go with my abdominal pain. There are plenty of other places to eat in the San Diego airport, find one other than California Pizza kitchen.< /review>< gmap_id>

Amy did my nails and she was very kind and she did a great job. However when it was time to cash out my total came to $45. Which is $20 more that what the baseline price is for a full set on their wall ($25). I did not have gel polish, my nails are not that long, and I have a basic shape. Zero designs, regular acrylic, nothing extra. this happens to me whenever I go to an Asian salon. I feel like because I am young and black they may feel like I’m not going to tip them (which I always do). So I ended up spending $51 for a basic full set. Does this happen to anyone else? John and sand nails did a full set plus a pedi and my total was $35!!! So something ain’t adding up!<//Text>

<time>1605951216142</time><Review>Today was my first time at Skylar Nail Spa | Nail Boutique & Eyelash Extensions and I am absolutely amazed. My friend and I got beautiful and well done pedicures and full sets of acrylics. I've been getting my nails done for years and this is by far the best nail salon I've ever been too. The service is amazing and their attention to detail is unreal! (I didn't catch the name of the woman who did my acrylics but she was so sweet and extremely thorough)<//Review>< Name>

Pretty good salon. Frequently busy.
Cindy did a great job on my nails and really tried to get me out on time after I was seated late. I will definitely come back to visit Cindy.

I wish there were appointment only blocks during the day or they had a better system to keep track of appointments. This was my third time there and every time, I see people who aren’t seen on their appointment time. I had an appointment scheduled on a Saturday at 10am and I was seated at 1030. Apparently, they open their doors earlier than 10 so if you want to be seen earlier/on time on the weekend, you need to actually get there around 930.< /Text>

<Text>Best nail salon in the country!!! I travel a lot, lived in CA and have tried many fancy salons, trust me no salons provide the warm lotions and hand massage services like Silks.  The staff had been there for years and is very detailed and super clean, even my husband enjoys coming with me. Silks is the best!!!!< /Text><Response>{'time': 1582612316428, 'text': 'Thank you so much we hop see you soon'}< /Response><user>110920107759706425652< /user>< gmapID>

<Text>I went to get a full nail set with stickers and designs and all .They broke in less than a week .i tried to give them another shot today and they said they can only vouch they’re nails last less than 2 weeks . Which means they are not a good shop because I’ve had nail sets last at minimum 3 weeks. And no one in there knows how to double tip which is basically making your nails long if you like long nails like me .Dont go there because they are not cheap and it’s not quality work .Stay safe .< /Text>< gmapID>

< Review>
I love love this nail salon but they let me down this time. I had an appointment with Vivian but apparently they over booked her or didn't let her know she had a 1230 appt. either way I was fine with anyone in the salon to do my gel manicure because all of the women are very good at what they do. I got my nails done on a Saturday afternoon...5 days later my gel manicure starts to chip and on one nail the gel comes completely off. Usually when I get my nails done here they last for 2-3 weeks with no problem. I spent over $70 for a gel mani and pedi and this has not happen to me before. I guess next time I should just walk in and not even worry with an appt. Maybe that would make a difference 🤷🏽‍♀️<//Review>

< Review>
So this is my second time coming to this location and I love it each time. My mother turned 50 and I wanted to get her nails done[ she always does it herself and she needs a little change and treat]. The owner ended up doing her feet and nails and my mother loved it.

this is a very popular place they opened at 10. we got there around 10:15 and it was already a 30 min wait. [ we had time so we waited]. Parking is tricky tho. strict rules in the front of the shop but there is a community parking in the back for all the businesses but its rarely any spaces.

Services:
1 gel nail manicure, 1 regular manicure, 2 regular pedicure= $85
which isn't bad.

I had a wonderful conversation with Caitlyn I think she said that's her name. language barrier but we worked through it. we talked the whole time. I liked her and she did a great job.<//Review>

I went to Isabella with hair that is not easy to reverse. She was honest, hopeful and very positive. She took good care of my hair and made sure I leave happy. I went to get highlights a week ago and it turned out better than what I had in mind. She's good, detailed, clean, quick and very kind. Forever my stylist Isabella :)<//text>

I have visited this nail shop multiple times, but this by far has been one of my worst experiences. On Saturday, March 2nd, I visited the shop and got a full set + a pedicure. Jenny always does a great job on my pedicures, so I have no complaints. I usually go to the owner, Pasty for my full set acrylics; however, she was incredibly booked so I opted for another manicurist. She completed the job and I had no complaints at the time. Fast forward a couple days later, my nails start lifting. Now, typically this happens after two weeks, but it hadn't even been a week yet. I went into the shop after speaking with Patsy over the phone. Once I got there, she starts saying that I used chemicals on my hands, which I didn’t. After I explicitly stated that I didn’t use any chemicals, she proceeds to make another excuse. This time blaming the lifting of my nails on my body. She said and I quote, “your nails are healthy, so your nails grow faster.” That’s not true. I’ve gotten my nails several times and this has never been the case (certainly not after only four days). At the end of this convo, she agrees to repaint my nails free of charge. After SHE removed the nails polish from my nails, she then said she would have to charge me. I will not be returning to this shop seeing as though they value money over the quality of service delivered to their customers. I will be inserting pictures below:<//review>

I hated the fact that they did my nails n less than a week came back for a fill that was just as much as a full set, their gel nail is highly expensive n it's not even top of the line, observed how they do not sanitized their instruments after each client. I will never n do not recommend if u guys do come please ask for sanitized instruments!!! That is disgusting.</Text>

{'time': 1540050629219, 'text': "Lleraldina, I can assure you that all of our instruments are sanitized after each and every use. The health and safety of our customers is our number one priority. I don't know what would have given you an impression otherwise, but it is not the case at all. Our full sets cost $25 and up, and our fills are $13 and up. So, while they're not the same price, I'm sorry if you felt they were expensive. We think that the quality of our manicures and attention to every detail makes it worth it though.

< review>
I was hesitant to shop for an engagement ring online, but Yadav came through 100%! I worked w/Ellie initially via the chat function, who offered me a discount and helped to facilitate payment, which was super easy. In terms of the overall experience, I preferred picking up the phone and speaking with someone, as I felt the response time, information gathering and promised production deadlines via the chat/e-mail function post purchase were a little slow, which was frustrating and disappointing.

I was super fortunate that Susan answered the phone that day I called the store post purchase. She was AMAZING at helping me choose the right setting and with customizing it. She was super friendly, patient detailed orientated, professional and was always thinking two steps ahead. She always kept her word, whether that was to call/email me back or fill me in on something. The experience would not have been the same w/o Susan! She went above and beyond and so knowledgeable! She put my mind at ease.

Nan was also great in the payment process!

The turnaround time was great. Two weeks for custom made and shipping was super quick - 1 day FedEx and the box was nice and discreet!

The ring itself is GORGEOUS! The detail and high level quality is unmatched and I found the price for the diamond I got was a steal! Definitely would recommend YADAV to others!<//review>

<username>Samantha Dahmer< /username><time>1621347936165</time><rate>5< /rate><review>My husband and I had an amazing experience online with Yadav! We actually found them through the New York Times recommendation for buying a whole sale diamond through rarecarat.com! We appreciated the discount if wiring the money. We bought a 1.01 carat diamond from Yadav for a custom setting we loved we found in New Haven, CT. The experience was so fast with great communication. The diamond was packaged beautifully, with the certification, and overnighted through FedEx without any trouble. Our jeweler in New Haven was shocked at the quality for the price and asked for me this shops info. For a young couple in our early 20’s, you guys gave us the best! 10/10 would recommend! Thanks again!!</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkhM9S-GSFbrQOIR1XkFwaMsYJ4TuazLnnc4_F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEzpMVH2zKByTVlO-OZZqadZcpaz4UoTmfJ2I0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaovTZ9QVYHLIPglySv0UKQ8n31LZbiiO6Or5U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNls2MwZzL48XkEh7gsDSJbwYOXl-GMaEwAmEhG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeNfL_AfxyWWI_AOl6iDB4hq4aD9kivivS_Tx-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I was looking to replace my girlfriends Pandora promise ring and wanted a reliable small business to help me. I ended up ordering a 0.52 carat Diamond ring on a beautiful solitaire setting. At first I was reluctant to order from Yadav since I have never been there and I am no where near California to visit their showroom. After looking at their website and comparing them to other retailers, it was clear that they had the better deals for better diamonds. It was very easy to get in contact with their employee. The ring arrived only a week after I ordered it and 2 Day shipping once they ship it out. She loves the ring and I do not regret choosing Yadav over the other large companies that everyone knows about. I will definitely be coming back here if I need a diamond jeweler in the future!< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_n1XHECGVwkCVy8SNIoPjW-RI_FawOllIz8Yr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYtFnbWv9qUhITmziP3rQdd4zrXdJVhd9GCZDS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

<Review>Vivian helped me select and finalize my purchase of an engagement ring a few months back. She was quick to answer, jump on the phone to answer questions, and provided authentic input. She made the process easy and I am confident I received a competitive price compared to other diamond retailers. I will definitely purchase more jewelry from Yadav again.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>Great experience with Yadav. Price was the best I'd found. They were able to set the diamond and ship very quickly. I believe I had the ring sent to LA within 9 days. It came packaged very nicely, also overly packaged which they should! Customer service was always responsive. I have not one bad thing to say about my experience.</Review>< time>

Bought engagement ring and both wedding rings from Yadav; we could not be happier with the purchase. Quality of the rings is exceptional and the service excellent. Also, turnaround for resizing was fast. Will return for future purchases. One critique: email communication could be improved. I would suggest a trigger email notifying the customer of status of rings, etc post purchase, prior to delivery.</Review>

Great website to find fine jewelry, easy to use and friendly. Didn't give it a full 5 stars because I purchased a set of diamonds that no longer were available and had to reduce the diamond quality for the same price for another pair. I'm still very happy and satisfied with my earrings after a lot of back and forth. My only feedback is to not sell what is not in stock!</text>

<Review>I was so nervous about buying a diamond and creating a custom ring 100% on line (I live nowhere near CA). But all the local brick and mortar jewelry stores were just outrageous in the prices they quoted me.  The entire process,  start to finish could not have gone any smoother- I spoke primarily with Ellie and she was so patient and calm with all my dozens of questions. I purchased my center stone first but wanted to see it in person to confirm it was a keeper. Then they paid for me to ship it back to them and we started the custom design process.  I gave them a LOT of clear cut details and images to go on, but the end product is literally flawless and EXACTLY what I envisioned. Every detail from the right "tone" of rose gold, (I like more pink and less coppery) to the size of all the acccessory stones, to the "low profile" basket setting which was very important to me.  End result = 1.75 carat center oval stone (E color, VS1 clarity) set very low on a basket setting with a 1/2 pave band (2 mm wide) and a dainty hidden halo. Wedding band is 6 bezel set diamonds (0.5 carat total weight) on a 3mm rose gold band. Because the main ring is set so low, the wedding band cannot sit flush against it so they designed it in an "interrupted " fashion, meaning there is actually a gap in the wedding band to give it the illusion of sitting flush. I chose to solder the 2 rings together for this reason, so the wedding band would not spin and show the gap. It's like they read my mind and the best part is I expressed wanting it done in time for a trip to Turks and Caicos and they somehow managed to build this ring from scratch and have it in my hands in 7 days flat! It is stunning and I am so happy with it, 10/10 for Yadav!<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDLd9MF1vMjXl1s25OjC87FRH4G9kzeL7sNBSP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvo1AnS_bekLoymW0f8jF86QhfIZ67BArghtW6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-DPMsX_80o0agv61213y1dHAncziAihKPyyzU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVbYtDGH69NBSpXxymW0zlif-srQp1A1bMMhvl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

My fiance and I had the best experience shopping at YADAV, and we were all the way on the east coast! Maytal was very patient and accommodating as we custom designed my ring. She made my ring a priority and we recieved it in record time! I would advise anyone who enjoys great customer service with a family vibe, to shop at Yadav! Not to mention this jaw dropping beautiful ring that we received!!</text>

Yadav was excellent! I bought the perfect engagement ring and she loved it! Yadav had a great selection of both natural and lab diamonds and many settings that were much classier than what some other online vendors had on their websites and more in line with my now fiancée's tastes. They also let you do 3/4 sizes for the rings while other jewelers only did increments of 1/2. I had a great experience working with the Yadav customer service team and they were able to price match a diamond that was also being listed on a competitor's site. I had a great experience and would recommend them to anyone!</text>

I was a little apprehensive to buy a diamond without seeing it in person. Yadav had a clear return policy, so I took a chance. Communication and reassurance from them was great. When I received the stone, I was astonished! It was a gorgeous, brilliant, sparkly diamond, much better than I expected. Besides the quality, the price was amazing. I would definitely trust them.
Thanks, Yadav!< /review>

I overcame my fear of online purchasing, and I could not be happier with my decision.  Yadav is full of friendly, focused associates who ensure your satisfaction.  I had the diamond inspected at Diamonds Direct, who verified that the inscription matched the GIA certificate.  The diamond is beautiful - see for yourself.  And the setting and craftsmanship are top notch as well.

I HIGHLY recommend this jeweler for engagement rings.  I will be using them for my Wedding bands as well.  I hope to one day be able to visit the team in person.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_gi6_85HY5y43evby4X22VmBGEIGwvQlepPqa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

<name>Grant Fergerson< /name><Text>Regarding my online experience:
They were very helpful in the first half of my ring buying experience, answering my questions about the ring and diamonds quickly and in detail.
After purchasing the ring, the person I was communicating with was not helpful when trying to work out the details of the delivery. They will only deliver to the billing address of your credit card, and require a signature at delivery, which was very difficult because I wasn't working from home and my fiance-to-be was.
The ring itself was almost flawless. They center setting is a bit crooked, only noticeable because there is a tiny gap between the setting next to it on one side, but not on the other.
My fiance contacted them about her wedding band, but they didn't get back to her. When I reached out about getting a wedding band they did get back to me, but I wasn't happy with the experience.< /Text><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I purchased a diamond from Yadav in December and had them set it in a simple platinum band.  First, the diamond is absolutely gorgeous.  I was hesitant to purchase a diamond without seeing it first, but they sent me videos and extra pictures that I requested.  The information they had on the website was spot on.  Second, the craftsmanship of setting the diamond in the band is pristine.  It is a beautiful piece of jewelry.  Third, when I purchased the diamond, I wanted to put it on multiple credit cards.  When I processed the order online, an associate with Yadav called me within just a couple minutes to take my credit card information.  It was seamless and painless.   Lastly, Yadav kept me updated on the status of the ring after I purchased it.  It took them a couple days to set the stone in the band, then they sent it to me overnight mail.  I can't recommend Yadav enough.  The ring is beautiful; my new fiancee loves it; this experience has been amazing.</review>

Yadav put it all together resulting in a gorgeous ring. I live out of state so I had to take a chance and ordered it online. I couldn't be happier!<//review>

Yadav was the perfect place to buy my engagement ring. I spent many months researching, and with Covid I decided to go with Yadav while living on the opposite coast because of other good reviews and because they had the lowest cost and nicest ring design. The agents were very helpful, I reached out repeatedly for help and they gave me honest opinions on diamonds. They offered a great price, kept me updated with the shipping process and had great communication. I would strongly suggest Yadav to anyone-I trust them and even though I am thousands of miles away I won't go anywhere else.<//review>

<Review>I spent an enormous amount of time searching the internet for the perfect engagement ring for my fiancée. Yadav was the only jeweler that had the setting I wanted, with the perfect stone, at a great price. I was thrilled with the customer service I received. The whole process was so easy. When I received the finished ring I was blown away. My lady was amazed that such a beautiful ring was to be hers.
I catch her looking at it all of the time. When we had it appraised for insurance purposes I pleased that the appraisal was considerably higher than the purchase price. I would not hesitate to recommend Yadav to anyone in the market for the perfect ring for their special someone.  I am a very satisfied customer.<//Review><Rating>5</Rating><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Name>

Yadav was great to work with. Amazing email communication throughout the process. I wanted something custom and they delivered!  They shared CAD designs and a week after I approved, they built a beautiful ring at a great price.  I did have to have it resized (solely my fault), and they happily did so in a couple days.</Text>

Yadav was absolutely unbelievable to work with.  Whether it was my emails with questions, or my phone calls, they treated me so well and went above and beyond to answer my questions.  They sent extra videos and pictures of the diamond I was considering.  They did this and so much more.  Every time I need something i heard back very quickly.  Nan was the employee most involved and she hit it out of the park with customer service.  My fiancée, now wife, absolutely loves her ring and matching wedding band.  I would recommend and buy from Yadav any day of the week.  Thanks for making my big purchase so easy and amazing!<//Review>

We got my 2ct solitaire diamond ring last year from Yadav, and of course I was nervous as they are in California, and I am in Idaho! I am so glad we did! Its been a year already and we have their yearly extended plan. It was such a easy process-mailed it Fed Ex, paid by Yadav and a week later I got it back and it looked as the day I got it! It is the most beautiful ring and the sparkle was out of this world. I put 2 diamond bands with my solitaire that I bought from Costco and they checked those diamonds and made them sparkle as well. The best customer service in all the land. I highly recommend them! I get complements all the time on how beautiful my ring is.</Text>

I ordered an anniversary ring online at Yadav.
I was initially hesistant as I had not heard about the store and this was not an in-person purchase. However, the whole experience was seamless and the  responses were prompt and thorough. We got the ring before actual estimated time and it looks great. There was a size-mismatch (we provided larger dimensions) and they corrected it at no extra cost and shipped it right back. Recommend for anyone wanting quick turnaround and clean finish for their jewellery<//text>

Yadav was incredible from start to finish when I worked with them to custom design my fiancée's engagement ring. They were highly responsive and friendly throughout the entire process, and always answered my questions thoroughly before proceeding to the next stage. The ring design I was going for was totally unique from any of the settings they had on their website, so naturally, I was a little concerned if Yadav could actually achieve the exact design I had in mind (since they'd have to build it from scratch). But let me tell you, they nailed the design PERFECTLY and it even ended up looking better in person than I imagined! I was blown away by the ring's beauty, and so was my fiancée! I would highly recommend Yadav to anyone, especially if you are looking for friendly, honest, and knowledgeable experts to help you create a totally unique ring.</Review>

Like I said before—-I highly recommend this place.  Thank you sooooo much</Text><rate>4< /rate>< resp>

Bought an engagement ring from them.They were fantastic. So helpful from the beginning questions to the final part of being the ring sized and then resized. Went and got a personal appraisal done to make sure what i paid for was what i received. Appraisal was 100% accurate with what i received. I would highly recommend them and will be going to them for the wedding bands as well.</text>

<rating>5</rating><review>I had a really great experience purchasing from Yadav. Living in Colorado, I never had the chance to see any of the ring options in person before purchasing online, so I felt like I was taking a little bit of a leap of faith. That said, they had great product content and details on their website, and their online chat tool was a lifesaver, as the employees on the other end were extremely knowledgable and helpful (and not sales pushy). Between the chat assistance and Yadav's customer-friendly online purchasing policies (e.g., free insured domestic shipping, 30-day satisfaction guarantee, an affordable appraisal add-on option at check-out) I felt confident making such an expensive online purchase decision. Most importantly, the ring itself lived up perfectly to expectations, and my fiance was thrilled! I would definitely recommend Yadav to others, and would absolutely consider them again for future purchases (just not an engagement ring...I only plan on buying one of those).</review><gmap_id>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d<//gmap_id><Response>None<//Response><Date>1621618288009<//Date><username>Matthew Etzler<//username><pictures>None</pictures>< UserId.>

As a first time diamond buyer I did a lot of online research to find the perfect diamond. All of my online searches led to Yadav, and I'm glad they did. I went to Yadav twice -- once to see some diamonds and rings in person and to learn more, and the other time to make the purchase. Both times Maytal helped me and she was super helpful and patient with me, which I greatly appreciated as I'm sure I was asking really basic questions. Very happy with my purchase and the service that I received, will definitely return to Yadav for any future jewelry purchases!<//text>

I ordered a diamond ring that I was told would be shipped 2 weeks later. After waiting I got the ring, but I received the wrong setting. I called them up and they apologized and I sent it back. After another 2 weeks, I got the ring I wanted and all was good. It's very nice and well worth it.<//text>

More than 3,000 miles away I was a little reluctant to make such a large purchase, but I did my research and decided to trust Yadav Diamonds & Jewelry with one of the most precious moments in my life. Let's just say I'm glad I did, they delivered BIG TIME, every step of the way. I got the VIP treatment from both Maytal and Sheila. They are very knowledgeable and took care of me from beginning to end. They worked with me to customize the ring to flawless specification. The ring turned out absolutely stunning.  My fiance'e loves it and constantly gets compliments. And the best part to me....  Along the way, something didn't quite go to plan that could have ruined our whole experience. At first I was definitely on edge especially being so far away, but let me just say that the entire team at Yadav made me feel comfortable, assured me that everything was going to be alright,  they totally owned the mistake which is rare in business today. Mr. Yadav, called me to extend his apologies, took full responsibility for the mistake and went above and beyond to make it right. The ring is absolutely stunning, and I got it at a tremendous value compared to local jewelers. That being said, the reason  I'll be customer for life is because I found someone I can trust who truly values their customers.  Not often today do you get the total package, Yadav Diamonds & Jewelry is the Total Package. Service/Value/Integrity/Quality< /text>

I can't say how much I was impressed with the customer service from Yadav. I had ordered 5 diamonds to be channel set in a custom gentleman's band. Less than two weeks after the approval of the CAD renderings the ring arrived. Absolutely flawless craftsmanship. I could have not been more pleased. Ellie guided the whole process beautifully. I have worked with a local jeweler for over 40 yrs and asked him for a quote.  I provided the GIA numbers for the diamonds to be fair.  His quote was almost $3000 more than Yadav using the same stones and identical custom mounting. I was initially apprehensive about ordering something of this price thru email communication. My concerns were unfounded after receiving the finished product. I would HIGHLY recommend Yadav to anyone looking to purchase custom jewelry.. Excellent customer service and unbelievable craftsmanship. My experience says you won't be disappointed!<//Text>

The folks at Yadav made it a really easy process from start to finish, and my fiancee has been over the moon with the quality of the ring and stone.

I had a wonderful experience working with Yadav. We were in the market for an upgrade and they had a wonderful selection of quality diamonds and a variety of setting choices. The website was user-friendly and the order arrived just as described, on time. For such an important purchase, I couldn't have been more pleased!< /Text>

I bought my now fiance's engagement ring at the beginning of the year.

I found the Yadav site easy to use. The price was excellent. The service (mostly via email, plus one phone call) has been excellent as well.

After selecting the stone and ring combo, there was a notice on the site letting me know that it would take a few extra days since the stone had to be mounted. It took about 10 days to arrive, which seemed fairly quick to me.

I had to send the ring back to take it down a half a size. That process was pretty seamless and they paid for the shipping.

As far as the ring is concerned, my fiance LOVES it. She has received more compliments on it than I can count. I'm not much for jewelry myself, but I find myself staring at the stone. It's mesmerizing.

Overall, I think this purchase went as well as it could have. I don't regret not buying the ring locally. I got a great deal and there were no hiccups.

I 100% recommend this company.</text>

Yadav makes everything easy when shopping online.  I can find the right diamond and setting and compare prices to get the best value for my budget.  I recently bought wife a pair of earrings and she loves them.  The diamonds also came with their original GIA certificates.  I'd highly recommend Yadav for diamond jewelry<//Review>

Working with Yadav was exceptional from start to finish. They helped me create the ring of my dreams inspired by a ring from another jeweler. Sheila, my point of contact during the design process, was nothing short of amazing. She was super responsive and attentive to all my questions, concerns, and design edits and was really invested in helping to make my design come to life. It was clear that she was so excited for my now fiancé and I, and it felt like I was truly working with a friend. The craftsmanship is immaculate and I have been showered with compliments on my unique ring. We will surely be going back to Yadav for our wedding bands as well. Highly recommend on every level!<//Text>

The team at Yadav made the process very easy working over the internet and phone. Over a 6 month period I think I connected with them in person, via chat and on the phone (went in person pre-pandemic and then everything else remotely from east coast).

Everything worked out perfectly and the ring is amazing. 3 carat oval cut with pave setting. Fiancé can't stop staring at it and everyone loves it.

Thank you Yadav!!!!< /Review>

I can be a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to large purchases. The staff at Yadav has been outstanding in dealing with me. They were prompt in their responses and providing all the education and information I needed to select the best diamond available. They actually found one that was a better quality than what I had originally selected, but at the same price range. I would highly recommend Yadav!< /review>

<review>What a great experience. I was looking for an engagement ring, and went to all the local big name stores, but wanted something specific so I reached out to Yadav. Every single person I spoke with was very helpful and knowledgeable. I was skeptical buying from a jeweler in a different state I had not heard of (especially with an expensive engagement ring), but I felt comfortable after speaking with them. I got to pick my own stones, and they custom designed the band for me. When I got the ring, all the diamonds had more “fire” than any ring I saw in the store. My fiancé was so happy with the ring. When other people see it, they always comment on how much it sparkles. Also, Yadav had one of the best prices I could find. Make sure you consider Yadav for your jewelry, you will be happy you did.< /review>< GmapID>

Yadav is the most impressive jeweler I've come across. Their online presence is incredible, which is how I purchased an engagement ring for my fiance. I found the diamond on RareCarat.com, and it was the most incredible diamond I've ever seen! Yadav's craftsmanship of their rings is second to none. The quality of the engagement ring I purchased was breathtaking.<//review>

Working with Yadav has been an absolutely awesome experience! I went to a few other jewelers and felt like I was just a number trying to be sold something I didn’t want. At Yadav, they truly care about their customers and the quality you pay for is what you get. Edan was truly awesome and worked with us for months to find that perfect stone I had been looking for. They also have the best pricing that no one else can compare to or even come close! Yadav has made me a customer for life that I would recommend to anyone looking at engagement rings or fine Jewlery no matter where you are! Much love from Texas!<//text>

<review>Impressive business model. The ability to select the diamond by filters is common place in the world of online diamond sales but their ability to custom make the setting is second to none. They actually do 3D renderings prior to order confirmation. I would have never been able to get the diamond and setting that would made her happy locally where I live central ny. If you’re skeptical about buying something like this online (I sure was) you won’t regret it. Worried about Shipping? Oh ya they sent it from San Francisco to me in less than 18 hours. I’m picky and they were patient enough to deal with my never ending email chain of questions and requests. They also shockingly did not get upset after I told them I would need to wait 8-9 months until I ordered. I simply emailed the original associate again later that year and we picked up where we left off. I did a lot of research comparing Diamond prices online with AI driven comparison sites and consistently their prices are the best bang for your buck if that’s all you’re worried about. The setting was also not expensive (relatively speaking) for a custom one made of platinum. Why did I leave a review? Simply put I want a free ring cleaning kit because I’m cheap. If that tells you anything about the cost to value ratio they provide on the ring itself....it should.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

I am very satisfied with my beautiful diamond from Yadav.  The price was significantly lower than comparable diamonds from other stores. I had mine shipped to me and was also very impressed and satisfied with the level of care that went into the packaging. Would highly recommend this experience to all other buyers</Text>

Great service. Was able to pick out the diamond I wanted, the setting for it to go in, and the ring still arrived in under a week. Pricing was very competitive and I was able to get a great ring at a good price.</text>

<review>Yadav Jewlers was a wonderful experience!

I was hesitant at first ordering online in general, not being able to see anything in person, especially on such a higher value investment such as a diamond ring......I decided on Yadav based on customer reviews, their competitive pricing, and of course their money back guarantee policy.... I had ordered an emerald cut for my fiancé’s engagement ring, with a simple solitaire gold band.... I had done plenty of research, so I knew exactly what I did and didn’t want as far as the specs of the diamond go.... I have to say, the ring was absolutely perfect. I couldn’t have been more pleased. I chose to have it appraised at a local appraiser, and I was pleased with the appraised value, so fear not when it comes to getting a great value!.....On top that, the customer service, response time, and sensitivity to time and attention to personal needs were anything but sub par. Needless to say, I was very pleased.....If I had to start the process all over again, or recommend Yadav Jewlers to anyone, I wouldn’t hesitate for a second! All around 5 stars!

My fiance proposed to me with a Yadav engagement ring and it was everything I could have ever hoped for. We live out of state and they made it incredibly easy for him to make the purchase remotely. I also reached out after the engagement to ask a question and their team was very quick to assist. Highly recommend!<//review>

I received the diamond and all supporting documentation in a nice package within days of placing the order. I recommend Yadav to all of my family and friends.

I am very satisfied with the ring that I got from Yadav. With the company listing all the majority of its stones online, I were able to pick out the stone I loved the most. Walking to their physical showroom, I got the chance to meet with the staffs and see how certain diamonds actually looked like in reality. The customer service was also the strong point of this particular jeweler due to the staffs' friendliness and helpfulness during the ordering and delivering process. Both me and my fiancé will definitely refer Yadav to our friends and family in the future for sure!<//Review>

Yadav was able to customize the engagement ring exactly how I wanted it, and the shipping was faster than any of their competitors.  I would (and have) highly recommended Yadav to friends and family.<//Review>

<review>Absolutely 5 star experience.  I spent a lot of time researching various online jewelers and decided to go with Yadav.  Buying something online for $10K+ without physically seeing the product is a bit of a nerving experience.  Yadav hit all the marks to alleviate my concerns (as best as possible).  Great website with lots of pics, outstanding prices, quick replies to emails, and they answered the phone the few times I called and provided excellent customer service.  The product was received on time and was even more impressive than expected.  I highly recommend Yadav.</review><Name>Scott Erlichman</Name>< user>

<review>Recently proposed in NYC to my fiancé.  Spent time on several diamond websites looking for the right combination of quality of diamond and workmanship, website easy of use and customer service.  I landed with Yadav and it was an excellent decision.  Once I selected the ring and setting, customer service was immediately there to guide me through the process and offer support when needed.  Communication was excellent once we finished the details of the ring, the construction of the ring and the delivery.  My fiancé loved the ring is really an understatement.  I would highly recommend Yadav for your next jewelry purchase.

Thanks

had a phenomenal experience working with Yadav for an engagement ring. The staff was incredibly friendly, knowledgeable and made me feel very comfortable with shopping for the big purchase. Took a lot of stress out of a somewhat stressful process of buying my first diamond ring. There are plenty of jewelers out there and specifically in the jewelry mart, but I ultimately went with Yadav due to other positive reviews, fair prices, selection, and flexible policies. I couldn't be happier with my decision and experience. I worked specifically with Kyle, and Maytal/Jim - everyone was very kind, courteous and was able to give me clear answers to my questions. The engagement ring, diamond came out beautiful and look forward to doing business with them again for future jewelry needs.</review>

<review>I searched online for a quality but reasonably priced diamond earring set for my wife. I searched for weeks and felt like I had struck out until I found the Yadav website. I was able to match loose diamond sets based on the criteria I was looking for. They are priced much better than other online sites. I was able to expedite the setting and shipping process to ship them in time. I highly recommend Yadav.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Their customer service is wonderful and they respond to emails promptly. I recommend Yadav 1000%, you can’t find the quality of jewelry for the prices they give ANYWHERE. Trust me, we did a lot of research and came across Yadav after being unsatisfied with a ring from a different online jeweler. We look forward to purchasing more jewelry from Yadav in the near future< /review>< rating>

My experience with Yadav was via Rare Carat, but my experience with both companies was so spectacular I really wanted those considering working with both companies to know how confident they can feel in their decision. My fiancé and I were so nervous buying a ring online (as I'm sure many are) and wow, we are so glad we did. Most local jewelry stores were incredibly overpriced (as many jewelry stores are, they have rent to pay). When my fiancé found Rare Carat and we saw their reputation and the quality of vendors they worked with we knew we had a winner. Yadav has the highest quality diamonds and jewelry and their pricing is very competitive. I interacted with Yadav and Rare Carat throughout the purchase process and their staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. I know my fiancé and I will be repeat customers and we've already started telling our friends and family who are considering getting married/buying their spouses jewelry about them. I am so thankful to you both for having such excellent customer service and reasonable prices.  Thank you so much for caring about your customers. Thank you so much for having such high quality products and such great quality control. I am so grateful to have such a beautiful ring. Every time I look at it I am reminded of the team at Yadav and Rare Carat and smile. Thank you all for making it such an incredible experience!!!!< /text>

<review>Amazing experience and more amazing rings!

We visited multiple stores in search for a lab grown diamond engagement ring. We looked at some of the bigger names (rare carat and brilliant earth). But we followed a recommendation to check-out Yadav and it trumped the rest. Particularly because the offered:
- Full customization of the ring
- Best selection of diamonds to choose from (we were very particular)
- Lowest price we could find in the market

Some nice bonuses that made us happy we picked them:
- They allowed us to swap the diamond itself a few days after placing the order
- Purchase included 30 days of insurance from the moment they handed us the ring
- Joe, the owner, and his staff were wonderful to deal with, knowledgable, and fair with their prices

I highly recommend Yadav! They're an ethical store that's reliable, honest, and efficient, with GREAT prices and a knowledgeable team. There was an order mishap with the diamond I originally purchased from them, and they connected me with their senior gemologist to help me find another diamond immediately. The customer service was truly remarkable, and I ended up with the stone of my dreams. Thanks, Yadav!</Review>

<Text>Oustanding customer service!  I ordered her engagement ring in March and just purchased the matching wedding band in December.

The team at Yadav was great to work with and very friendly, they also have some of the best prices out there.

They shipped within a few days of my ordered, and I received both orders in excellent condition.

I spent a lot of time looking for the best value, but should have started with Yadav, because it would have saved me a lot of time.< /Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< GmapID>

<review>Excellent customer service. I worked directly with the owner. He personally reached out after I made an inquiry online. Yadav got me the best stone possible for the best price possible! I’d highly recommend doing business with them. FedEx signature required drop off over night delivery with live package tracking the whole way. I look forward to doing business with them again.< /review>< pictures>

<text>Great experience with working with Layla from Yadav to source my diamond and design the band for my engagement ring! She said, "Yes"! And absolutely loves her ring. My only constructive feedback would be that the custom-designed rings should come in an unmarked ring box, rather than one with the name of the designer on top and inside.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMZSzZrq-RVVk7mQFSer74A4Imf_3na3pKX1qp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

I ordered a beautiful, very high quality,  emerald cut diamond from Yadav Diamonds & Jewelry and had them set it in a solitaire ring setting for my fiance's engagement ring.  She was ecstatic and thinks it's the most beautiful ring she had ever seen! Yadav did a fantastic job in providing a beautiful diamond ring at a very good price! We are very pleased and would highly recommend Yadav to anyone looking for quality diamonds at very fair prices.<//Review>

<Text>I was first a bit skeptical about buying a diamond online. As probably the third largest purchase in my life, after home and car, I would like to see the stone in person, before I make the decision. However, I took the, what I thought was, risk. Looking back, I have no regret.

Nan was the sales helped me, highly recommend. However, I did dealt with a different person, forgot her name, she wasn't very pleasant. Nan replies message quickly and clearly, great communication. And the transaction was easy, and was able to accommodate my special request - nothing crazy, but just very tight timeline.

The stone and the ring are well above my expectation. I got something look well and seem to be consistent as they advertised. No complain at all.

Overall, my experience is very good. I would recommend this jewelry shop to anyone when asked, and likely would come back for other purchase.</Text>< pictures>

From start to finish my experience was exceptional. Selecting a diamond was a breeze with their easy to navigate website and the customer service over the phone was excellent as well. My loose diamond arrived in beautiful packaging with all of the appropriate paperwork as well. I will definitely purchase from them in the future and  recommend them to friends and family!< /text>

I was able to find the engagement ring that my fiancé wanted for a great price.  I live in Southern California so the staff helped send me pictures and videos of the diamond. Sure enough, I liked it and pulled the trigger, it took a week for the ring to be ready and 3 days for the ring to be delivered. I requested for the package to be discreet. about 2 months later I decided to bend the knee to my now fiancé and she hasn't stopped looking at the ring since then. It was beautiful and affordable. Thank you staff at Yadav.<//Review>

<Review>Loved our experience with Yadav! There was no sales pitch or high pressure to make a purchase. They were very helpful and informative and even found us a ring that exceeded our expectations and was way below our budget! Everyone was warm, friendly and made the entire experience fun! We bought a ring that same day and picked it up a little over a week later. I highly recommend them to everyone and we are over the moon with my engagement ring.<//Review>< Pictures>

I am very happy with  the service provided by Yadav Diamonds and Jewelry.
I needed  to get a diamond by a certain day  in the  near future so I was looking for a reliable Jeweler. But I did not want to over pay for the stone just because  I need to get it right away. In searching for a Jeweler, I found Yadav Diamonds and Jewelry in Rare Carat among trusted Jewelers. The price was very competitive and they acknowledged right  away the availability of the particular stone with certain qualities. As promised, I received the stone  days before promised. I will recommend Yadav Diamond  & Jewelry for your stone. I would not hesitate to purchase more stones from them.</review>

After searching multiple stores I settled on Yadav jewelers for a diamond ring. The overall value of the ring and the diamond was outstanding. The site was very easy to navigate and their staff was tremendously responsive. It can be unnerving to buy expensive items online but Yadav Jewelers simplified the process and eased my nerves.
Overall very happy with the ring and had a great experience.< /review>

They are the most helpful and educated gemologists that I could have asked for. A detail that I realized was crucial was that they adapt and know what you mean when asking a question and can give suggestions accordingly. Would highly recommend that everyone speak with the team!<//text>

I ordered an engagement ring for my now Fiancé all online. I took a risk that Yadav would be able to get everything together in time since it was the holiday season. I received the ring a week earlier than expected and she loved it. I would 100% recommend Yadav for any of your jewelry needs. Also, the customer service was great! Any email I sent I would get a response in less than 24 business hours.< /review>

Easily the friendliest, most helpful jeweler I've worked with thus far! Given the covid situation I was hesitant to go through the process of looking for and purchasing an engagement ring solely online, but Suzy was so, so incredibly helpful in helping me find the perfect diamond. Yadav also offers what I've found to be the best and most fair price for their diamonds compared to the other jewelers I've looked at. Can't recommend Yadav enough!< /review>

It was a pleasant experience doing business with Yadav.  After eight months of researching the market and shopping for the right diamond, Yadav proved what all of their reviews were saying.  I got an amazing diamond for much less than what I could find comparable diamonds for elsewhere.  Thank you to the Yadav team!</Review>

After searching near and far (Mumbai, Hong Kong, local vendors) - I came across Yadav while searching for the perfect diamond engagement ring. They had a wide variety of options, prices that were unbeatable, and top notch customer service. I'm sure that we will be back for our wedding bands in the near future!<//Review>

After doing a great deal of research I purchased a beautiful diamond ring from Yadav Diamonds.  The diamond quality was exceptional and the price was better than at other sites.  The ring was made and sent promptly.  They honored my request to size the ring to the nearest 1/8 as opposed to 1/4.  I will definitely use Yadav again .<//Review>

Designed my own engagement ring and I couldn't be happier with my decision to go with Yadav! The website is very user friendly and everyone I spoke with over the phone was helpful. I had my heart set on a lab created diamond and they had many to choose from which you could narrow down by filtering the detailed specs. Needless to say, I was waiting anxiously for the day of delivery and they did not disappoint! I am still absolutely in love with my ring...oh yeah, my husband too< /review>

It was yet the most enjoyable experience I've ever had when it comes purchasing an engagement ring. I mistakenly, picked the wrong size for my girl, once I received the ring communicated back to Yadav and Yadav right away said "No problem" they sent me a prepaid envelop for Fedex and I sent my ring back to get it sized correctly. Yadav made it into an incredible experience all the way through.</Text>

Purchased a diamond for an engagement ring. Everything about the process was great. As you can imagine making a large purchase over the internet can be a bit nerve racking, but they made the process easy. They communicated with me regularly and continually updated me with tracking numbers. I would definitely do business with them again.<//review>

I have no complaints with the diamond I purchased, it was a great deal and a beautiful rock. The customer service team was very helpful and quick to answer questions. I had to resize the ring after purchase and the whole process was very easy.  Highly recommend Yadav.< /Text>

I started researching online. I was sent an e-mail by Vivian from Yadav Diamonds and Jewelry because I had briefly been on their web-site. Vivian was extremely knowledgeable.She listened to my concerns and responded with the information she had but also encouraged me to research her statements further if I needed any clarification. I did. I was pleased to see that her information/advise held up to the scrutiny of the vast internet. Vivian/Yadav took me from 50% certain I wanted to purchase a manufactured diamond to a terrific Christmas Surprise for my wife.  I began looking around December 15th and had a fantastic 1.53 carat diamond on my wife's  hand Christmas Morning. I Live 3,000 miles from their retail store so all of this was done on line.The diamond is magnificent and the service was spectacular. The pricing was better than all of the other,major names in diamonds that can be found on line. The value provided has me recommending Vivian and Yadav to anyone who asks me about their commitment to excellence both in product and service, and when people see my wife's ring,the questions begin to flow.</Text>< Date>

I am writing this review largely in part due to the amazing customer service I received from Nan. I have never in my life met a customer service associate who is more responsive and helpful than her. Thank you Nan, you are amazing!

Unfortunately, there were a few hiccups when it came to my ring. My fiancé found Yadav through Rare Carat. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my ring. However, there were a couple flaws which should not have passed their quality control when it comes to an engagement ring. I had to send my ring back in for a resize as it was too big. The process to ship the ring back was extremely easy (thanks to Nan) and I was able to receive it back in a week. But when I got it back, I realized that it was crooked and there were two gaps in the ring (as pictured). I had taken a couple pictures before sending it back as well which I was able to show as proof that the gaps happened after the resizing. Thankfully, Yadav agreed to take the ring back and fix the gaps which I was very grateful for, though I was now anxious I would have to ship my ring back a second time and be apart from it for another week. When I got my ring back for the final time (two pictures against white marbled background), the gap on the part of the band with the row of diamonds had been fixed (yay!) But the gap in the middle still remains.

I love my ring so much and don't want to part with it anymore, so I don't mind the gap too much as it is pretty hard to see unless you're extremely close and scrutinizing. I would just think, for such an expensive ring with such a beautiful diamond, you'd hope the quality is 100%.

All in all, amazing customer service but 1 star off for the quality control.< /review>

I am STUNNED by Yadav's service. I'd been in awe looking at their diamonds online for awhile now, which are consistently priced very competitively, and I found a pair of 3/4 total carat weight diamond studs for the same cost as the best-priced 1/2 carat studs from anywhere else (and Yadav's were better quality, too!) in December. After wearing them for 3 months straight (true everyday earrings!), the back of one of the earrings fell out when I was in public, and I couldn't find it. At 4:50pm today (Friday) I called to ask if I could come in to get a replacement backing (hoping it would only cost $100-200), and the very nice woman on the phone said they would have availability for me to come in today! When I arrived an employee was very nice and found a backing that matched my earring. Then she said I was good to go? And that the replacement backing is complimentary as part of their service guarantee?! As someone with a tendency to lose things, my mind is blown! We didn't pay up for the service guarantee, and I didn't even have to provide any proof of purchase. I understand how valuable service is, but you're not even paying up for the service -- it's almost the opposite! I fully recommend Yadav to the internet, just as I have for a friend who got their wedding rings and engagement ring at Yadav a couple months ago!

TL;DR: best prices and service in the jewelry industry<//Review>

Absolutely incredible experience.  I did more than my fair share of research.  I knew what I was looking for but I needed some babysitting.  Sheila sent me an email and was able to talk back and forth.  We spoke by phone and she made all the difference!  Helped me find everything I wanted and walked me through my purchase.  The ring is amazing and would highly recommend Yadav!<//review>

<Text>I could have never gotten such a good pricing for the ring I bought. Sheila was really helpful and walked me through every step of the process. She knows her diamonds well, and took the time to explain all the characteristics of the diamonds I was looking at. She also provided recommendations based on the inventory they had and the diamonds that they were going to get. I finally narrowed it down to 2 diamonds and she told which one to pick and we have no regrets. It was the perfect stone and fit so well in the setting we chose. I would definitely recommend Yadav, and specifically Sheila. Especially if you don't know much about diamonds or rings, she's your person to go to.  The only negative was the cleaning price and servicing, but for the overall price we got, it was definitely not a deal breaker at all.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great experience with Yadav! I did have some concerns but they alleviated all of that in a hurry. Purchased online and had a beautiful ring on about 10 days. Communication was great. My fiance loves the ring and I couldn't be happier with the price and process. Highly recommended.< /Text>

Yadav is like family to us, from our first meeting a couple years ago we've felt like a part of the Yadav family. Maytal, and her father Jim have been wonderful helping us with our diamond selections...in October 2020 we purchased my Mother a beautiful love bracelet, she turned 80 and it was a great surprise! My Christmas gift this past year, was a lovely diamond band from my honey which Maytal made happen with her wonderful expertise and care. Thank you to Yadav Diamonds & Jewelry for being so thoughtful, professional and caring to us. We send you our heartfelt thanks and blessings.</Review>

I purchased an engagement ring from Yadav, including the center stone and the setting. The process was easy. I used an online appraisal service to have this and other stones evaluated. The online service with certified gemologists strongly recommended I purchase the Yadav stone for being an exceptional price and diamond. With that endorsement I purchased it with no issues. It arrived on time and was gorgeous. Although I initially was concerned about purchasing online, it was a very easy experience. I had a small issue and the Yadav team was very helpful and arranged for me to send the stone to them and then back to me. I have no complaints and look forward to purchasing other jewelry from them in the future. I highly recommend with no reservations.< /review>

I purchased loose diamonds site unseen online to be put into studs for earrings becuase they had the best prices and I wanted to lock in my purchase! After making my choice I made a trip to the shop to view the stones in person and confirm my purchase. With the shelter in place order it was hard to get into the building so the staff graciously met me outside so I could view the diamonds in natural light. They were quick to set the stones and I picked up my complete purchase within a few days! Highly recomend Yadav, they were great to work with and provided a great product. The earrings look great!<//Text>

I was nervous making this large of a purchase online but going through the process and comparing against other sites online was a breeze. I even had a phone consultation to explain the difference between a few diamonds that met the requirements of what I was looking for. My (now) fiance loves the ring and is happy and impressed with what I picked out. Yadav is now at the top of my list anytime I want to purchase jewelry.</review>

<review>Yadav made my ring buying experience feel so special! Their customer experience reps were always excited to answer my questions and my ring arrived promptly and in beautiful condition. My now fiancé and I feel like we got a STEAL for my ring. The quality blew us away and they had the best selection of settings. We purchased a lab created diamond. For anyone considering companies like Brilliant Earth, I’d pick Yadav over the big guys time and time again!< /review>< Pics>

Yadav had so many options to choose from and I was able to get a great idea of what Diamond I was ordering with their online viewing options.  The ring arrived looking even more shiny and sparkly than it looked online and I couldn't find a complaint if I needed to.<//Review>

<text>At first I was a little reluctant ordering a ring online without physically seeing it. The folks at yadav took the time to assure me over the phone that if I did not love the ring they would help me find another. They provided me updates with my shipping information.  I would patronize their business without hesitation!< /text>< pictures>

<text>I was skeptical at first looking online for an engagement ring. I shopped around and researched different companies when I found Yadav Diamonds & Jewelry. The reviews seemed really well overall and their website was easy to navigate. Their selection of diamonds and settings was vast. I decided to purchase an engagement ring through their store without ever setting foot inside. I built the ring and purchased it with ease. The ring came in and it was better than I expected. It's beautiful and exactly what I was looking for.

The customer service is OUTSTANDING!!! I have never had better customer service from a jewelry store than Yadav. I don't know if I've ever had better service from any store or business as a matter of fact. They were very helpful through the entire process. They responded quickly to every need or request I had before and after making a purchase. I would recommend using Yadav to anybody if you're looking to buy jewelry. I will be coming back to purchase an wedding band and a wedding ring (for me) in the future. I'd give them 6 stars if I could but I can't.< /text><Date>1600369558403</Date><GmapID>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d<//GmapID>< name>

We were skeptical at first, but after doing research and speaking with their experts, we understand and are very happy with our purchase. We also really loved their customer service. Their staff was really helpful.</Review>< pictures>

Yadav made it as painless as possible, providing candid feedback during the shopping process and bringing me along the journey with a 3D rendering of the final product. My fiancee was blown away with the ring, and it was all made possible by Yadav. I'm still convinced I got the best value from Yadav compared to any other diamond retailer (and I shopped A LOT).< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhjzmsTorHE5joXmKMijC9frIp6OL6hmbzuwE9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVDk2xvQ9AXlqqkBdNJLiFjCUZ8oqu4sHDuntH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjnuW0GjzW4EPwfIb3pD_KBpggROubuX994Idx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d< /gmapID></record>

<review>Yadav has been a wonderful Company to work with. From designing a ring, to getting it resized (twice), they have been so helpful. They are sincere and trustworthy, which can be rare in the diamond industry. Their prices are also unbeatable!

Absolutely amazing doing business with them. I had a custom design in mind for my engagement ring and was nervous about the final result. They took longer than expected because of multiple issues during CoVID but when the ring came in the mail, I could not have been happier. Amazing craftsmanship and beautiful ring. Exactly how I wanted it. I get compliments on it all the time. Thank you</review>

I’m extremely satisfied with the engagement ring I bought.  The jeweler was in contact with me about when it might ship & the setting was something I couldn’t find anywhere.

My only gripe is that there was a fingerprint and some fuzz on the ring when I opened the box the first time.  I cleaned it off no biggy.  I like to think the last person sending it off couldn’t stop admiring it.  Would recommend!!< /Text>

<Text>I spent some time looking for diamonds online using rarecarat.com  and Yadav had a few stones I kept my eye on that were within my price range with the specs I wanted. Yadav listed easy to read info about the diamond, shipped incredibly fast and had good communication as well.
The packaging of the diamond was really incredible, it was so neat to see that beautiful stone in the little metal tin they provided I wanted to show my future finance! Boxing was tasteful and all the paperwork was in quality envelopes as well which I still use to keep safe.
I would absolutely recommend them to someone looking to buy online.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Text>Went to their show room trying to order for an engagement ring today. The sales lady sat nearest to the door greeted us with a few words, said would help us in a few minutes and asked us to sit and wait. And we waited for about 20 minutes, she was firstly busy knocking on her keyboard and then simply ignored us and went straight to another costumer came later than us to pick up his order and he has already had a salesman helping him. During this time even other sales in the store saw us sitting there waiting they didn’t even bother asking whether we need assistance. And I guess they just can’t wait to see us walking out of their door so they don’t have to serve us. The show room is just like a UPS/Fedex delivery room and they prefer to do business with customers who shop online and won’t waste their time giving actually services. Got so disappointed and mad at the service( we’ll consider we wasn’t actually given any) and if you don’t mind shopping with this attitude then go ahead and put order online, maybe you will even be on their Instagram to be part of their virtual advertisement.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Everyone at Yadav was so friendly and helpful from my very first email inquiry to the prompt delivery of my jewelry. I love that they are an independent, family-owned business. They have excellent customer service and very high quality pieces at competitive prices. It is clear that they truly care about their work and they went above and beyond to make sure I absolutely loved my new piece of jewelry. I can’t recommend Yadav enough and I will definitely be going to them for my next project!< /Text>

Yadav did an amazing job. I shopped on a site that had several different companies but I had heard great things about them as a company and they offered diamonds that were superior in quality for an amazing price giving me the most for my dollar. My new Fiancèe loves it and her ring definitely gets noticed everywhere we go. I had NEVER thought to purchase a diamond online and was a little hesitant but the diamond came on time and with all the right certifications and everything!</review>

Absolutely the best. Yadav made sure that our diamond would arrive in time for our last-minute proposal. The value and customer service exceeds all other locations that I visited in the last few weeks. I'm thrilled with our purchase, and though we can say that that there won't be anymore engagement ring shopping, we will come back soon for our wedding bands. Thank you!<//Text>

Yadav was an excellent resource in finding exactly what I was looking for. I gave them very specific criteria, and although there were no stones that matched at the time I made the request, they were able to find a perfect example fairly quickly. Additionally, the look I wanted for the setting was a blend of 2 different rings they carried (very thin band, 6 prongs). They custom made the setting and produced exactly what I needed.
Don’t worry about being picky with these guys, they are very understandIng and a pleasure to work with.<//Text>

<review>I went in person pre pandemic to see what diamond and ring my gf would like. We had a blast! It was one hell of an experience! The owner and I believe hos daughter helped us and they made it so easy to understand while making the experience fun and enjoyable. I ended up buying the ring and diamond in February during the pandemic and the help online with his staff was above and beyond! I def recommend! Also my gf is now my fiancé and she loves the ring sooo much and so do all our friends!!<//review>< Pictures>

When I found Yadav I must have already seen 5,000 rings and diamonds.  They had the right combination of service, high quality, selection and cost.  The choice was now easy.

I had a few questions that they quickly answered and made my choice simple.   I got exactly what I wanted in a diamond and found several unique setting.   I few minutes later I made a decision and a purchase.

They kept me informed as the diamond was set and the ring was shipped.

On time and just as I wanted.

Follow through has been great as well.< /Text>

<Text>Exceptional customer service. Layla helped me with the buying process for my engagement ring and ensured it got here before my wedding date. I was weary buying a diamond online after being sent a fake diamond ring from Natalie Diamond prior to Yadav. I was sure to get the ring Yadav sent me tested for authenticity. When I asked a local jeweler if they had a diamond tester, they immediately said that they didn't need one to know that the ring on my finger was real. It's not like they even held my hand and looked at the ring, either! They were several feet away from me and could tell that this ring was not a fake! That made me incredibly happy. Just in case though, I took it to a Kay's jeweler and had them test it and of course it tested as diamond. I am now looking into a band upgrade for my current setting on Yadav's website.</Text>< GmapID>

<text>Buying my fiancé’s engagement ring through YADAV was the best decision I could have made. They were very fast at finishing and shipping the ring. They even made special changes to the ring that I wanted done. I saved thousands of dollars using this service and would recommend it to anyone wanting to purchase diamond jewelry without paying the huge extra cost from big name retail stores.< /text><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

Ordered my fiance's ring from Yadav from the east coast. Their sales department was awesome. They were on top of everything I asked of them and never seemed to care about the sale but just to make sure I was happy with the product I got. Which was amazing, my fiance loved it.<//Text>

<Text>I purchased my fiance's engagement ring from Yadav. I did this over the internet, which always makes me a little nervous. I must say, the ring is simply astounding, breathtaking even. I could not be happier and she can't go anywhere without being asked to see it. I highly recommend them.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Purchasing my engagement ring with Yadav was super easy and it turned out to be exactly what I wanted. Sheila was very helpful and helped narrow down which diamond and also helped in the design of the custom band and setting. It took ~2 weeks to design and make and then was shipped over night to me. It is perfect!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<review>Yadàv over delivers on the quality and value of their rings. I brought a 1.5 carat princess cut channel set engagement ring with the matching eternal band for my now wife. When she went to get the set appraised, the rings literally appraised for 90% above the cost I paid for them, nearly double my money. My wife gets complemented on the weekly basis, which is saying a lot because we barely go out given the Covid pandemic. I would highly recommend anyone looking to get a great value without sacrificing the quality of the center stone.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Fantastic experience choosing the stone, setting, and making a custom ring. They were very professional and so happy I trusted them. She is beyond happy and the rings were better quality for a better price than other online shops. I went into the store three times and was never rushed!< /Review>

Spent hours picking out the right ring. Ordered it and had it delivered to my parents so my girlfriend didn't see it. Then I get an email indicating Yadav's insurance won't cover the shipment if the billing and delivery addresses don't match. BUT if I pay by wire transfer, then the insurance would cover it. Don't know if it's a scam, or if it's the silliest policy ever, but I will never do business with this company again.</Text>

The customer service from Yadav was impeccable. I needed the ring on short notice and they constantly kept in touch and made many different arrangements to get it to work. You're working with a company that cares for you and it shows. Their prices and diamond quality, and many various setting options are unbeatable.<//review>

The ring I received was beyond beautiful.  Customer service was pleasant and responded pretty quick.

I wanted to visit the store but getting in the building during COVID was complicated.  Their customer service team worked with me to get me the ring fast for my proposal plans.  Worked out fantastic.

Definitely would go back to them.< /text>

Yadav is simply the best! I purchased my fiancé’s engagement ring from them and we could not be happier! She has received countless compliments on how beautiful the ring is. The shopping process is made really easy with the 360° view of the diamonds, and my diamond looks just as pictured. The customer service is also great! One of their reps informed me that the original diamond I selected would not fit into my chosen setting very well and sent a recommendation for a different one. Other companies probably wouldn’t have done the same. Yadav will be my number one recommendation to friends and family!!</review>

<Review>First class customer service.  Maytal and the team of professionals at Yadav Jewelry tirelessly worked with me throughout the jewelry selection process.  This is not easy to do virtually, and from the east coast.  I had reservations making such a significant investment without setting foot in their location.  My fears were relieved during the process, and completely erased when the engagement setting arrived.  My fiancée receives compliments on her arrangement regularly.  Thank you Yadav Jewelry!</Review>< Pics>

Yadav did a great job with our engagement ring and they have been very easy to work with. I went through Rare Carat, and Yadav was seamless on fulfilling my order and getting exactly what I needed. They make it easy if you need to make any adjustments to the jewelry, and the pricing they offered was very competitive. I would use Yadav in the future for other jewelry needs.<//review>

<text>Yadav was awesome from the start. Even when I stupidly forgot to put a size on the ring I ordered, they immediately contacted me to ensure my order would be correct and asked me what size I needed. Ring came sized correctly. They provided FAST two-day shipping with insured shipping. A lot of piece of mind. Ring arrived exactly how I pictured it. It came with grading paper work (free) and appraisal (at small extra cost). They also provided 10-days of full insurance coverage for free so that you can spend time to find the insurance plan that is just right for you. Absolutely wonderful experience with Yadav. I highly recommend!</text></record>

<Review>I had a online purchase of a Diamond ring from Yadav 9 months ago. it was such a Seamless process. I was wondering that I purchase a diamond ring by online at the very first time, but everytime I called with a question I was greeted by a very friendly employee and I got clear answer from them. My diamond arrived at my doorstep quickly and had no issues. I recommend them to anyone looking for a beautiful diamond at a fair price!</Review>< GmapID>

This review is long overdue & the bottom line is I could not recommend Yadav enough! Making such a big buy online was nerve wracking for my fiance but everything went smoothly and as promised. Not only is my ring  absolutely beautiful but the customer service is excellent as well. After receiving the ring it needed to be resized. A customer service rep responded quickly and let us know how to mail it back for resizing. We were nervous about the process but again Yadav made the process easy and returned the ring quickly.</review>

I purchased a Diamond from Yadav about 6 months ago and it was such a SEAMLESS process. Everytime I called with a question I was greeted by a very friendly employee and my questions and concerns were addressed and handled with empathy and haste.  My diamond arrived at my doorstep quickly and without any issue! I will buy from them again in the future and recommend them to anyone looking for a beautiful diamond at a fair price!</review>

Yadav was amazing to work with. While my wife was in a coma after a tragic accident, they custom-made a halo diamond necklace that matches my wife’s engagement ring at a very reasonable price. The diamond selection is large and great quality, as is the craftmanship. My wife has worn the necklace everyday since coming home from the hospital and hasn’t taken it off.<//Review>

My wife loves the engagement ring we got from Yadav! They allowed me to create the perfect ring for her, and it arrived on time in great condition. And it was less expensive than similar rings in local jewelry shops. They did a great job, will buy jewelry from them again in the future.< /Review>

But i do not regret, it was a perfect business transaction and i must say, the service was great but the product was even better than expected. My fiancé loved it!! It still sparkles a year later. Now that i can trust Yadav i will buy again from them but bigger.</text>< Time>

<text>I wanted to wait to post a review until after proposing to my girlfriend in the case she may stumble on the review. Well after 10 months of initially receiving my engagement ring, here’s my review of Yadav Jewelers! Up until the purchase, I spent countless hours of researching the many options for an engagement ring. When I was directed to Yadav’s by Rare Carat, I instantly had that “this is it” feeling. Living in Portland, OR and the store being in San Francisco, there was a lot of anxiety with shipping but I was pleased to say it was very seamless and secure! The actual ring is very beautiful, my fiancé absolutely loves it, and I would definitely recommend insuring it with Zillion insurance. 10/10 would recommend a friend to shop at Yadav’s for their jewelry needs.<//text><Name>Billy Nguyen</Name>< Response>

I bought my fiance's engagement ring from Yadav. I generally knew the diamond I wanted from rarecarat.com. They helped me match the diamond to a platinum solitaire band, addressed my concerns about shipping, and advised me on a mating wedding band. The ring arrived when expected, and my fiance treasures it!< /text>

From picking out the diamond to getting the finished product, Yadav went above and beyond our expectations. It arrived when they said it would, it appraised for what they said it would.and the quality is excellent. We would definitely recommend Yadav to our friends and family for their diamond needs.<//Text>

<review>They were excellent throughout the whole process. They answered phone calls timely and helped me pick out small key features of the ring before I bought it. After I placed the order I wanted to make a change and they were very easy to work with. The ring turned out beautiful! I mailed it back to have it resized and it was a very easy process. Everything was better than expected from start to finish. I would highly recommend Yadav to any of my friends and family.< /review><Resp>None<//Resp>< pics>

When shopping for a lab grown diamond, it was very difficult to know which option to go with, and what store.  Yadav is based on CA, I am based in FL, but they sent multiple videos and answered all my questions.  If you're in the market, I'd highly recommend them.  Their prices were essentially the cheapest and the service was great.

If I had to buy another lab grown diamond, I would go straight there.< /review>

I worked with one sales rep the entire time to take my vision (what my now fiance said she'd like) and they made it perfectly! I explained what I wanted, they made a CAD drawing, and sent to me to proof. From there it didn't take long at all, and my fiance absolutely loves the ring. She said it was much nicer than anything she envisioned!!! I loved the fact that we customized the ring to be one of a kind, exactly how she wanted, and came out beautifully :)
Also the sales rep recommended a better metal than I was thinking, I didn't know much about diamonds and metals, and the sales rep helped guide me to the perfect ring.</text><response>None</response>< Pictures>

I live on the East Coast and was working with a jeweler in Canada on a Custom engagement and wedding ring combo but he didn’t do diamonds so he recommended me to “ Yadav Diamonds “ for the stones. What a welcome surprise. They couldn’t have been more helpful they helped me select the right stones and supplied the exact measurements for my jeweler. The communication from them was awesome until the stones were delivered. Thank you for seamless process. The Diamonds are stunning !
P. S. Did I mention that Yadav's pricing was excellent !!< /text>

<review>Yadav provided from the beginning of selecting a special 30 year anniversary diamond ring until I received the ring this year the highest exceptional  simple straightforward service. The diamond ring was the highest quality possible for the price but the art work complimented what I requested and was very satisfied. It was a pleasure working with Layla and the team. If you are looking for diamond rings or jewelry - you should always give Yadav a chance since you will be amazed what they can do for you.< /review><rating>5</rating>< Date>

Purchased an engagement ring through this seller, they had the best prices of anyone, and great quality and service. I later purchased both the weddings bands through Yadav as well. Highly recommend to at least look into Yadav if shopping for engagement or wedding rings.</Text>

Great experience with Yadav online and over the phone.  Great products with  clear, disclosed GIA Certification and #'s.  From my experience you can feel confident buying through Yadav's online presence.  Also, make time to get in touch with them directly to connect the relationship.  I certainly recommend and will buy with them again.<//Text>

Great spot. Had a friend get their engagement ring here as well as myself! Worked with Layla, and she was not only very helpful and informed, but not pushy and really gave me a slew of options to figure out the right budget. She always responded very promptly over both email and phone. My fiancé loved the ring.<//review>

<Text>I can’t begin to say enough good things about my experience with Yadav Jewelry!  Everything was so effortless and easy.  I worked with Shiela on everything and she went above and beyond. Answered all the questions I had, always very fast to reply, was easily available via email or text. I couldn’t have asked for better service!

I found Yadav via RareCarat.com and noticed that their pricing remained extremely competitive for diamonds. In addition, their ring settings are very reasonably priced and include a broad variety of options for both design and metals. Their website is user friendly and they do a great job of keeping it up to date. Lastly, the reason why I gave them 5 stars, in addition to everything already mentioned is that they have exceptional customer service. I needed a diamond shipped from overseas, mounted on a ring, and shipped to me before the date I was planning to propose and they certainly over delivered. I called in and emailed their team regarding the urgency around the matter and they were responsive on all communication channels. They have certainly earned my business in the future and acquired a life long customer. Thank you, Yadav.<//Text>

The customer service was incredible! I was traveling out of the country and they made sure I had my Diamond before I left. My fiancée LOVES the diamond and so do I. I can confidently recommend Yadav for all your jewelry needs. These people are the best and it shows. Thank you!!< /Review>

Enjoyed and well-informed, engaging shopping experience throughout my buying journey at Yadav. We started online sorting through diamonds and ended in the showroom in downtown San Francisco setting stones into our custom engagement ring setting. No pressure throughout. The gemologist and the entire staff were very professional. Thanks so much.< /review>

The ring was exactly as expected - the site is every extremely informative and almost feels as if you are shopping in person.

They also have Gemologist available on chat to clear questions if any which makes the process extremely easy.< /review><Time>1602376276743< /Time><Gmap_id>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d< /Gmap_id>< Rating>

Purchased an engagement ring through Yadav to be sent to me in New York. Everything was great, from the communication with them, to the way it was shipped. Ran into a bit of an issue with UPS, but that was in no way Yadavs fault at all. The ring was immaculate upon arrival, and both my fiance and myself are in love with it. It was absolutely perfect. Thank you Yadav.< /review>

They were overall GREAT!  First they spent lots of time with me in choosing and matching the diamonds for stud earrings we were giving to our mom for her 90th birthday.  Then they got them to us quickly and in perfect condition for gifting.  And our mom was really so very happy with her gift.  Layla even sent us extra post backs in case mom lost one or two.  Thank you very much for everything.<//Review>

<Review>My husband and I decided that we would celebrate our ten year anniversary by upgrading my engagement ring with a diamond. I had helped choose the original centerstone a decade ago, which was an inexpensive (i.e. $65) light green prasiolite in a chunky size. Yadav's excellent sales reps helped us choose the most beautiful diamond in exactly the dimensions and characteristics we were hoping for to fit my current setting. Yadav did a perfect job with the prong metal work and returned my upgraded ring plus my original stone in a gorgeous box, complete with paperwork. When I first reached out to Yadav, it was just to browse online and learn how much money we should start saving....but it turns out that the diamond and metalwork was a few thousand less than we expected so we bought a 1.80 carat(!) dream diamond right away. It's seriously breathtaking and I am so very happy to have felt so supported in finding exactly what we/I wanted. Thank you, Yadav, for a safe and happy transaction!!< /Review><GmapID>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d< /GmapID><resp>None< /resp><user_name>Clair L<//user_name><time>1612590033757<//time><Rating>5</Rating><pictures>None</pictures>< user>

<review>Yadav is amazing. I ordered an engagement ring right when the country started locking down and Yadav made sure I got the ring on time.

I actually ended up sending that ring back after speaking with a Yadav rep who helped me pick out exactly what I was looking for and even recommended setting the diamond low since my fiancé wanted a more low profile ring. The return process was super easy and I got the perfect ring back quickly.

After the proposal, we needed to send it back for resizing and gain the process was very easy and Yadav was extremely responsive.

Keep in mind that this entire ordeal took place during the lock down.

I highly recommend Yadav, for the value, excellent customer service, and knowledgeable employees.<//review>< Name>

<Text>Using Yadav as a first time experience was really positive. It's a reputable company and service who link you to other reputable dealers. Quality and certification, with insurance for international postage was a must and is there with all purchases. Hassle free, worry free and all with no risks given it was insured for the journey! Their customer service was also top shelf, so it was an overall perfect experience for me!< /Text>< time>

<Review>Yadav has great customer service and great quality for a reasonable price.  My first engagement ring was stolen only 1.5 years into marriage, and they even helped us in choosing a replacement that was similar to my original even though diamond prices had risen.  We live in Missouri and I would highly recommend this west coast jeweler!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I was searching for a loose diamond for a setting that I had already purchased. The price point and quality of Yadav cannot be beat. I purchased the diamond online and chatted with one of their representatives through their online chat system. They promptly responded and answered all of my questions. Shipping was easy and the stone came in a really cool aluminum housing to protect it. The stone in person was beautiful and was everything I was hoping it would be. Thank you!< /Review>< GmapID>

<review>I ordered an engagement diamond through this company after seeing the one I liked on Rarecarat and had it shipped to me. Normally I make large purchases like this in person, especially if it was jewelry, so that I can inspect it and don't have to worry about shipping. Luckily, they had detailed descriptions, photos, and 360 video of the diamond itself so I felt confident enough to make the purchase.

Shipping was very very secure as the diamond was wonderfully packaged in its own little metal capsule, in a weighty box, inside shipping bag, inside a medium box, then AGAIN inside a large shipping box. It had multiple layers of protection and there was no way of telling it was a multi thousand dollar diamond inside. It also required signature on delivery.

The customer service was quick to respond if I wanted a refund, exchange, or shipping updates. The only downside was that the shipping took about two weeks.

Fiance absolutely loves the diamond and gets compliments on it all the time. Keep in mind this was a lab grown, 1,63, ideal cut, oval, vvs2, colorless, all for $4300. Robins Brothers wanted $10,000 for an equivalent lab grown diamond.

That is the last taboo, not related to this company. We were skeptical about getting a lab grown and the comments that may come along with it so we went to check out both lab grown and mined diamonds in person. The salesperson laid 3 lab grown and 3 mined in front of us to let us decide which one is which. After feeling confident on our choices we were completely wrong. There is no way to tell by eye the difference between lab grown and mined unless youre an absolute expert on it. So fellas, you can go up in size and quality by going this route.< /review>< pictures>

This was a great buying experience!  The customer service on the chat and over the phone was great.  The ring got here within the time it was promised and was EXTREMELY well packaged.  My fiancé loved the ring and we will definitely be repeat shoppers for our bands!</review>

< Review>
Got an engagement ring here, couldn't be happier with how it turned out! When the diamond I originally picked was no longer available, the staff was very helpful in finding a nearly identical diamond the next day! Highly recommend coming here! Oh, and she said yes!</Review>

<user_id>106224601631867653741< /user_id><Review>Fiance is extremely happy with her engagement ring, and we were able to get a high quality diamond for a great price. Price differences for what I was looking at came down to 0.1 degree differences in cut, so do your research thoroughly to know if you are getting a bargain. Do your research! Yadav is one of a small handful of places that I found that has great pricing, and the only place of the few that I could go in person to see it with my own eyes.< /Review><name>John Park< /name><Resp>None< /Resp><date>1597682518664</date><Gmap_id>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d</Gmap_id><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

<review>I didn’t get a chance to go in the store, so I shopped online. I price checked many different places and ultimately chose Yadav. They have staff that were responsive, understanding, and knowledgeable. Some thing came up and they helped me problem solve and refund without issues. I ended up repurchasing with them and it was such an enjoyable experience overall!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

This is a great place! My fiance got my engagement ring from them, and so we wanted to also get our wedding bands at the same location. They were super helpful and responsive to our questions, and were very open to making changes based on our preferences. The end products were gorgeous, and exactly what we asked for!</Text>

I was hesitant about purchasing a ring online but both me and my fiancé purchased our rings online and it was the best quality you could find anywhere. I had purchased my fiancés ring elsewhere initially but there were a few scratches and the engraving wasn't even so I returned that and went to Yadav and his ring came perfectly! Do not be hesitant at all to order from here as they really do go above and beyond to make sure to provide excellent quality and that you get it in time.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<response>None< /response><review>I found a diamond on rarecarat that was sold by another retailer. I had already done my research on the various rarecarat retailers and was convinced Yadav was the best. Rarecarat reached out to Yadav on my behalf and Yadav was able to secure the diamond for less money than the listed retailer. Yadav has been great to work with. Like many reviews I see, I am very picky and had many emails back and forth with many questions. All answered very timely. It is a stressful process to buy such an expensive item sight-unseen, but Yadav minimizes the stress as much as possible. They were willing to send the loose diamond to us for inspection. Yadav (Maytal) then held a zoom meeting with us to view settings.  Maytal had a CAD design created of a custom setting that combined the best features of 2 settings from their website. We are currently in the process of mailing the diamond back for setting. I’m sure it will be beautiful.<//review><rating>5<//rating><gmap_id>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d< /gmap_id><pics>None<//pics><date>1613263875047<//date><user_name>Tina DeVries</user_name>< user>

My Husband bought me a beautiful new ring for our 40th anniversary and i love it!  If you are concerned about ordering any jewelry online don't be,  At least with Yadav, Because they will help you with any questions and issues you may have to make sure your jewelry is perfect for you.    Thank you so much Yadav you made buying a new diamond ring enjoyable!!</review>< rate>

<text>Found Yadav through RareCarat. To be honest I was a bit skeptical since I've never heard of this jewelry dealer before. However after a couple back and forths, the patience of the staff, and the quality of the packaging and diamond that was received our minds were put to ease!<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I was very worried about buying a ring online without seeing it.

I did a lot of research online about who to buy from and Yadav came out top.

I called and spoke to them and they were incredibly helpful and really put me at ease.

I ordered an engagement ring and it arrived when they said it would. The ring was absolutely beautiful, even better than I could have imagined.

I proposed in Vienna last year with the ring and my girlfriend was over the moon (I think she only said yes because of the ring!). She absolutely loves the ring and so does anyone who sees it.

I have since also bought a wedding ring from Yadav that they recommend to go with the engagement ring.

I cannot day enough good things about them. Do not worry about buying online from them, they are exceptional! I will definitely be going back!</Review>

<Review>Unfortunately, I lost my original engagement ring. My husband and I spent months looking online for the perfect diamond. When we finally found it on Yadav's website we made an appointment. The staff there were so welcoming. They were prepared to see us. Since the diamond I had my eyes set on were not in their inventory, i had to order it from their website. But, they did show me several diamonds that were comparable so that I had an idea of what mine would look like.

The ordering process was easy since they walked me through it. They told me it would take about 2 weeks to get the diamond and set it, so I was pleasantly surprised when they called me a week later to say that it was ready! I had to work, so my husband was able to pick it up for me. It is absolutely gorgeous!!! Thank you so much to the team at Yadav!!<//Review></record>

So my wife and I are a bit skeptical when it comes to buying high dollar online.  Most think well it’s a diamond I get it, but let me tell you...  The experience and presentation when the diamond arrived was amazing.  Everything about the delivery was confidential.  I know I’m jumping all over the place, but lastly when we went to verify the diamond it was even better than we hoped for.  Thank you YADAV!!!<//Review>

Excellent 5* experience. I purchased an engagement ring here and Yadav has exceeded my expectations on all levels as I was purchasing sight-unseen. Yadav was on the lower-end price-wise but their quality and service surpasses every other online vendor I've dealt with. I purchased a diamond that looked perfect on paper, but wasn't easy to see in the video they had on it from their distributor. I communicated with the sales rep and she was awesome. She took the time to review the diamond with me and assured me it would look perfect in person (it does). She explained the diamond report and the very strong points it had. I had assistance with every part of the process and it was very comforting. I had concerns with how I wanted the ring to look with prongs and they were able to customize it to my liking. They sent me CAD drawings before it was made and communicated with me on timelines and shipping. The ring came out absolutely gorgeous. Very well made. The only issue I had was that I ordered it too large. I contacted Yadav right after I proposed and they offered me a free resizing upon my first contact and sent me a pre-paid label. Fantastic service, I will certainly buy from Yadav again in the future.</Text>

The service was excellent.  The only issue was the center stone became loose after two weeks, but the customer service rep was very helpful.  I was sent UPS next day air paperwork to return the ring for repair.  Once again excellent customer service.  Just waiting on the ring to be returned by to me.</review>

This is one of the if not the best engagement ring place out there. One thing that I was very impressed with are the different and unique styles of rings so you can get your fiancé a ring that will stand out and not look like everyone else. Customer service is top notch as well. Easily five star experience.</review>

Had an amazing experience with Yadav, and their prices were hands down the best around! Extremely fast shipping, great customer service and very quick with responses! I got my fiance's engagement ring from here and she loved it! Even needed to get it resized and they did it for free! Will definitely be back to purchase the wedding band!<//Text>

<Text>I had an amazing experience with Yadav. Do NOT HESITATE to do business with them! I bought one diamond they overnighted. I ended up not liking it due to the imperfections and returned it easily. Then found a smaller diamond they also overnighted that was perfect. The difference in price they refunded back to me via check. Their customer service was excellent and very responsive. My now wife loves her ring!!< /Text>< Name>

From start to finish I’ve had an outstanding experience with this company. Their website is an excellent way to shop, sizing, pricing, etc. I purchased the engagement ring and it was amazing. I received a much better price than I had from other retailers. My fiancé was blown away.  Yadav’s customer support was great too. My (now) wife loves the ring so much, we had them custom make her a wedding band to match it. This too was soooooo reasonably priced.  We had an issue w the rings not lining up with each other, no problem. They promptly fixed everything (they paid for shipping back and forth from the east coast) and the customer service was again, excellent, keeping us updated and in the loop - very responsive.

I would 100% use Yadav if I were in the market for an engagement ring.  They have the best pricing I found and their service was exceptional.</text>

We are in Kansas, they are in California. It’s beyond beautiful! Recommend Yadav hands down. I receive more compliments on my engagement ring than I ever imagined! We will be getting my wedding band from Yadav as well.</Review>< Pics>

<name>Benjamin Runyan</name><Review>Had a great experience with Yadav and their team. I had initially selected a stone that did not meet their standards and they felt that I wouldn't be happy with the selection. The team refunded my money and helped me find one that exceeded my expectations. Could not have been happier with their honesty and dedication to ensuring I received exactly what I wanted.< /Review>< pictures>

Dealing with this company was amazing from beginning to end.... my wife's ring needed to be resized and they accommodated the process of shipping back, resizing, and sending back at no cost to us.... the diamond was more beautiful than we even expected.... by far the best online service from any online company we have ever experienced.< /Review>

The process of picking a ring was so much easier than going to a store. They also have ready made rings for you to choose from or if you have something in mind you can choose a diamond and a style of ring and they can make it for you. The product is delivered promptly and safely. I recommend them if you are having a hard time finding the ring you want.<//Review>

I bought my wife's engagement ring and most recently a pendant from Yadav. Wife is getting a ton of compliments and could not be happier. Service at Yadav is top tier. Yadav had the pendant shipped overnight and arrived before Christmas. Santa delivered again!< /Review>

I was nervous about buying an engagement ring online, sight unseen. But they were so helpful, responsive, and prompt. Even when I had lots of questions because I was so nervous (I was buying the love of my life an engagement ring), they were super patient and answered all my questions. They even offered to expedite the process to get me the ring on a specific day. I’d definitely buy from Yadav again!<//Review>

I did a lot of research and found a stone on the Yadav site.  I have to say that I was very skeptical of making a large jewelry purchase on-line.  After actually calling Yadav, their representative on the phone put me at ease and I placed the order.  They delivered exactly as shown in their site and on time.  I am very satisfied and will buy from them again.</review>

This company far exceeded my expectations. They communicate well and the product was appraised at just a hair under double what I paid for it. I was able to pay in full by wire transfer to recieve an even better price. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase from them every time a diamond is involved.< /text>

<text>I was helped along the whole process when choosing diamonds for a set of earrings. I was able to individually select the diamonds of my choice online, going by clarity etc., they were then brought in to the store and I was able to pick which setting and material (white gold) to use. Overall, the process felt more like having a guide with me other than someone just trying to sell to me. I highly recommend them.</text><response>None< /response>< Date>

Contacted Yadav last November about if they could create a custom engagement ring. Sent them the specs and I got a turnaround time immediately from the jeweler. I also curated the loose diamond from them and the transactions were hassle free when choosing between stones. As I am from Seattle, total time to get my ring was around 4 weeks with sending them back diamonds, receiving new ones, and getting the completed product. Would do business with them again.</review>

<review>Shopping here was an excellent experience. I was worried about ordering online and not being able to see the diamond and ring in person first, but it arrived looking just how I wanted it. There were no surprises or delays. The recipient of the ring loves it and they get compliments on it all the time.

Thank you for the pleasant experience, Yadav.< /review>< GmapID>

I cannot speak enough superlatives about this company! They saved me money and I got a better diamond and setting than I was originally going tk get from a different company. They were great with communication getting the ring perfected and shipped to me in the time frame I needed it done.  I HIGHLY recommend this company to anyone who is searching for that perfect ring for their perfect someone!<//text>

I highly recommend them, they have a decent size inventory of all styles, diamonds and metals!<//Text>< pics>

My husband wanted to get me a pair of diamond earrings for Christmas and so we decided to check out Yadav diamonds and jewelry online and I had a question about the diamonds and Yadav emailed back and forth with me and helped me choose the perfect pair of diamonds for my earrings. Once I chose the diamonds and the setting I received my order in a timely manner. I would definitely buy from them again< /Review>

<review>I recently got an engagement ring from Yadav and it was a really great online experience.  I started looking early in the year and COVID hit.  I mentioned the time frame I was looking and felt no "salesman" like pressure from them.  Always a plus to not feel rushed or forced.

Once I was finally ready to purchase I did it fully online.  I will say my one disappointment is some of the sets won't be able to show different gem shapes.  For example I got the tessa set w/  a heart, but you could only view it with a circle.  Nevertheless it came out great.

I also picked Yadav because based on value they appear to have the best diamond pricing for lab created diamonds in my research.

Good luck to anyone else out there looking.</review></record></dataset><record>

I enjoyed the level of service I received from Yadav. I ordered a loose diamond and had them craft a setting and band to match it. They were really nice and prompt. The value was amazing. The ring turned out perfect. I will be a returning customer for sure. Thanks.<//Review>

Amazing Service and Communication - I was nervous about making a commitment to purchase my fiancée’s engagement ring online only, but Yadav and their team of customer service experts put me at ease. So much so I went straight back and ordered our wedding rings from them.</Text>

My wife and I worked with the Yadav reps to find the best diamond and setting available within our budget. We got more than we had expected and more than available from other online sites. What was delivered was everything we expected and more. Family and friends have bought additional pieces based on our experience.</review>

<Review>We couldn't be happier with our engagement ring from Yadav. Their team was very professional and swift with accommodating our needs.

With their help both online and over the phone, I was able to select the perfect center diamond given our specifications and budget. We also wanted a custom ring that included accent diamonds that belonged to our family. I was able to send Yadav the family stones with no trouble. Yadav was then able to build the ring given reference photos of another ring design we liked. The ring turned out exactly as we wanted, and all in a very short time frame.

All in all, wonderful experience. Thank you Yadav for this ring we will cherish forever.< /Review>< Pictures>

I felt more comfortable after talking to one of Yadav's gemologist, Sheila, who answered all of my questions and guided my fiancé and I in choosing a beautiful diamond and setting and even insurance. Yadav's pricing also seemed very competitive compared to other online retailers. To save some money I did end up purchasing our diamond via wire transfer. I would recommend sending a follow-up email to Yadav's office after you initiate the transfer. As a further improvement to Yadav's website I would suggest uploading more zoomed out videos of each diamond however I understand this may not be logistically realistic. Overall everything came out great and should I need to purchase jewelry or a diamond again Yadav would be on the top of my list.<//review>< Response>

I purchased a Princess Cut engagement ring along with a wedding ring.  My wife has had it for 9 months now and there are no issues with the set.  She  gets lots of compliments on the beautiful setting.  I will buy again from Yadav.

Many people might find it frightening to buy something as expensive as a diamond online, but do your research and know what you are looking for, then go to Yadav.  My diamond ring is beautiful, GIA certified, and Yadav had the best price for the quality.<//Review>

I am so pleased with my buying experience at Yadav Jewelry. I encountered a mixup initially because the billing address on the credit card I used was different from the shipping address. Yadav was very responsive through email and phone and was able to carry out my order. I am so pleased with the final product, the ring is beautiful. Thank you Yadav for the excellent service and product.< /Review>

I was extremely impressed with my experience buying an engagement ring from Yadav. I initially emailed back and forth with Maytal to set up an appointment for viewing several stone sizes in various settings. After that first appointment, I went home and selected a few stones from their website inventory so that I could view them in-person. The entire staff was extremely accommodating with my requests and they had the stones shipped to the store so that I could directly compare them during my 2nd in-store visit. I chose the stone that I liked the best, paid, and the ring was ready for pickup in a few days. It is absolutely beautiful and my fiancé loves it. Yadav's showroom isn't huge, but the customer service is top-notch and the prices and selection are absolutely fantastic. I highly recommend Yadav for anyone that wants to hand-pick their diamond(s) for engagement rings or any other jewelry.</review>

It was a pleasure working with my rep at Yadav who helped me customize my ring to be exactly what I wanted. She was extremely helpful and helped me through the entire process start to finish. When the ring size didn’t fit, I shipped it back for free and it was resized and back on my fiancé’s hand within a few days. Thank you!< /text>

<Review>With so many options when it comes to buying an engagement ring, things can get a little confusing! Yadav made the process so easy. I looked at many different online-only vendors but Yadav has the best pricing by far which surprised me since they have a store in San Francisco. I had previously visited their showroom and experienced very friendly service which helped me make the decision to choose Yadav. I then purchased the ring online a few months later and had a fantastic experience with Nan and Layla. They provide a 3D rendering of the ring for your review and shipped via FedEx overnight.

The ring is absolutely stunning! I highly recommend Yadav to anyone looking to purchase an engagement ring either in-person or online.<//Review><Rating>5</Rating></record>

<text>I went shopping and I stumbled on Yadav. At first I was very skeptical on ordering online, but during two business trips, I decided to visit their center and they have a lot of selections and very nice people to help. I finally made the decision to purchase a ring from Yadav for my wife to celebrate our 15 year anniversary. The got a really great deal and the ring looks beautiful. I would absolutely shop here again.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Enjoyed our experience with Yadav very much. Despite COVID and the city of San Fran making it very difficult for business owners to decide if they can operate safely, Yadav got our ring made and shipped out asap. So happy we chose them --- may take advantage of the diamond upgrade lifetime someday!< /text>

<Review>I wanted to create an engagement ring for my partner, and we both agreed to look for a lab diamond. I found Yadav online, and bought a lab diamond online. The website was easy to navigate, and the diamond was beautiful. We wanted to visit the shop in person, but don't live in the area - otherwise we probably also would've gotten the band from there also.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Got great advice from Jim on the phone, as well as several other members. It took a couple weeks to get here, but the price was excellent and the ring is stunning. Fiancé loves it. Definitely was apprehensive buying something so expensive online, but I’m glad I did. 10/10 recommend. Will be going back there soon to get her a wedding band.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Placed an order yesterday, had the confirmation, told the seller to call me this morning to set up payments and the seller said ok. I have to contact the seller again in the afternoon because no one called.
Then the seller told me the stone was gone even I place the order and had  the confirmation.

FYI, not to complain, the seller said they will give me a $25 off coupon on a $6.6k ring.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Even though they might be online mainly, they try to provide as much information and transparency as they could and my fiance really liked her ring in the end.</review><response>None</response>< rate>

We have been married for twenty years and were looking for a new diamond in a new setting and couldn’t be happier that we chose Yadav! Their customer service, knowledge and ease of making this purchase was simple without any pressure. The old ring/setting was less than a carat, so we upgraded to a 2.4 ct. cushion cut diamond in a halo with a split-shank setting. Their prices allowed us to get the upgrade we were hoping for without breaking our budget. The purchase comes with complete GIA appraisal paperwork too. Jim the owner, and Sumi were beyond helpful, so our decision making was easy! Twenty years later, we are happy newlyweds again!

Without hesitation, we’ll recommend Yadav!

Words cannot explain how grateful and how happy I am with my ring, thanks to Yadav's team and most importantly, the owner's daughter Maytal. She was very accommodating and would even respond to my e-mails late at night. My engagement ring was purchased from a different company and after changing the setting 3 times, they simply cannot bring my vision to life. So after a few researches and comparing prices with two other jewelers, I trusted Yadav to custom make the setting for me. This family owned business deserves all the credit and praise for their very personable way of working with clients and their unbeatable price. They gave me my dream ring!< /Review>

<Review>Yadav was probably the best diamond buying experience I could have had. I worked with Maytal who helped me source the perfect diamond for my fiancé’s engagement ring. I don’t think anyone could have beat their price for the diamond I purchased from them and the experience was so great I recommended them to my cousin who also got an exceptional E-ring from them.<//Review>< pictures>

I'll admit, I was a little nervous at first about buying a diamond I've never seen before but the pictures and videos online made it look perfect at less than half the price of my local jewelry stores.  Yadav didn't disappoint and I felt safe with their return policy.  The diamond was better than I expected and packaged perfectly.  I bought a loose diamond so I could have it set in a specific ring for sentimental reasons and Yadav crushed the competition.  The shipping was fast, I had tracking all along the way, and the customer service was helpful every time I called with questions.  I'll be going back to them for all my jewelry needs.<//review>

My first impression with Yadav diamonds is truly outstanding. Their team shared all details of diamond I was interested on ( ASET/IDEAL scope pics) that not many would have/share . I had bought my Diamond online from them . I searched all of NY diamond district before making decision to with Yadav. Their customer service is super responsive and patient to understand the needs of customer . My diamond came out so very beautiful! Thank you Yadav team . I am hooked to them for rest of my diamond purchases ! And they do have best prices in USA and excellent refund policy ( no questions asked ) . All in all excellent courteous  people to deal for any Diamonds purchases!
Btw I found them through Rarecarat!<//Text>

I did an absurd amount of research on diamonds in general trying to find the most ideal stone but with reasonable cost in mind. I ended up purchasing a loose lab-grown diamond and it is an absolutely gorgeous stone. I got the appraisal done and was happy with that as well. The diamond was delivered with UPS secured signature-only service in a beautifully adorned box. Overall, I found that for the quality to price ratio using my criteria and standards was best through Yadav.</Text>

<Review>I rarely post reviews but working with Yadav Diamonds & Jewelry was an exceptional experience that I'd like to share.  I had lost a diamond earring and wanted to replace it - a sad experience and not particularly an easy task.  Maytal was fabulous to work with - she is knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly but never pushy.  She was patient while I took some time to research options and decide what I wanted to do, and was ready to help at a moment's notice.  Once I made my decision she worked with me and helped with my selection.  I also requested a specific type of earring back that they do not normally carry on their website, and I wasn't sure if Yadav would be able to accommodate my request.  Maytal quickly sourced it for me to make it happen.  Her efficient handling of several shipments back and forth, together with her very pleasant demeanor, ensured that I felt comfortable and confident at each step.  I am extremely happy with the end result and the entire process.  I would gladly work with Yadav again and am happy to recommend them.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I bought my diamond from Yadav and from the first inquire till getting the diamond, I was impressed. I was very nervous about buying from a company located in a different state but I couldn’t be happier with the communication and patience they had. I highly HIGHLY recommend this jeweler and will buy through them again!</Text>

I had the pleasure of buying my fiancé’s engagement ring from Yadav and couldn’t be happier with it. Their attention to detail and flexibility was invaluable to me throughout the process.

Before purchasing, I researched other jewelers thoroughly. I met with a few very well known jewelers in NYC, but none gave me the sense of security that I received from Yadav.

Once I received the final product, I was blown away. My fiancé loved it and so did everyone who saw it.

Unfortunately, my fiancé lost it one day at the beach, but Yadav and their amazing insurance company, Zillion, had my back.

See, Yadav allows you to purchase insurance when you check out making the process smooth and effortless. This is something I probably would’ve skipped had I went with one of those hot shots on 5th Avenue.

Luckily, we were covered and the insurance company worked with Yadav to replace the engagement ring. The appraisal allowed for some room to upgrade, so Yadav and Zillion was able to accommodate a lager, clearer, more beautiful diamond, upgrade from white gold to platinum as well as a matching platinum band.

It is with great pleasure that I recommend Yadav to anyone looking for fine jewelry. Layla is amazing and was such a pleasure to work with. I’ve recommended at least two close friends already and will continue to do so as my close friends make their proposals.

Sincerely,

Joseph Quiñones<//text>

I had a phenomenal experience shopping at Yadav. I picked out a diamond and setting online from their website. The jewelers who I talked with on the phone were very knowledgable and responsive to all of my questions and concerns.

I ended up selecting a 1.78 carat G VS1 Triple X, no fluorescence Diamond with a white gold pavé band. In person, the ring turned is even more beautiful than expected! It is truly stunning.

My only wish is that such a gorgeous ring came in a box worthy to hold it. I found that the ring box from Yadav looked a bit too cheap for such a beautiful diamond - it seems as if it is made of cardboard. This is a small nitpick though - don't let it stop you from shopping at Yadav! I would recommend this store in a heartbeat.< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><UserId.>116940863250595060004</UserId.><text>Extremely pleased with the engagement ring buying experience we had thru Yadav.  We bought two different diamonds (fiancee changed her mind on the first one) and the return process was easy and hassle free with our full money back.  I shopped around online quite a bit and consistently found that Yadav had best prices available for comparable diamonds at other retailers (along with fast delivery).  Once we settled on a second diamond, Yadav also designed the setting itself based on my fiancee's exact specifications and it came out perfectly.  She is very happy with the ring, and would definitely use them again for future jewelry purchases.  Maytal in particular was our contact through the process and she was very helpful, friendly and responsive throughout.  Thanks Yadav!<//text>< gmap_id>

As an international buyer who bought online I Would recommend Yadav for buying diamonds or jewelry 1000%. The online process was simple and their staff was easy to reach with all my concerns and questions. Delivery was extremely fast and made my purchase much less nerve wracking.
My diamond is absolutely incredible!! Pictures don’t do it justice. I researched every online buying option and they offered the best value I could find anywhere in Canada & US.
Thank you so much for making this purchase seamless and comfortable.
My only suggestion would have been to provide advice on how the customs was going to work along with the tracking confirmation but I managed to sort it out easily enough along with your excellent staff!!< /Text>

We were initially hesitant to order an engagement ring online but Yadav made the experience seamless! My ring is more beautiful than I could have imagined and they worked so quickly to create the ring and get it to us, despite a pandemic! Layla was always quick to respond and so patient with my many questions and made sure I found exactly what I was looking for. Thank you Yadav!! For anyone in need of an engagement ring, I strongly encourage using this company!<//review>

<Text>The prices, combined with the setting options at YADAV can't be beat. Their team also worked with me on a compressed timeline to ensure everything went according to plan. She said yes, and I couldn't be happier.  Everyone consistently compliments on her on the ring as well.  We're going to get the ring sized down a quarer of a size soon, and they've been more than helpful.< /Text>< userid>

<text>Very bad customer service. Sales lady was on her phone. She has no interest or knowledge about diamonds or their availability. She was busy texting her boyfriend/girlfriend while we were waiting for her to respond. We had to repeat ourselves as she was not paying attention. Yadav, owner of the store literally asked us to leave because they were closing the store, why didn’t they even schedule an appoint 10minutes after they closed the store. We drove an hour to get there and our trip was of no use.
Worst experience and would never return.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I had a wonderful experience and I highly recommend Yadav Jewelry! I ordered a beautiful diamond online and it turned out that it had already been sold. I was contacted immediately and was offered a slightly larger diamond that was the exact same quality, for the same price. I was very impressed with their customer service and communication. The presentation box that the diamond arrived in was excellent!!!< /text>

I must have been the typical over anxious fiance to be, as I went to see Jim at Yadav Jewelry like five times before I purchased the ring of my choice. I also went back and forth changing the ring size three times, making sure it was the correct fit before the surprise proposal. Amazingly, no matter how bothersome I felt I was being, the staff at Yadav Jewelry was always so helpful and attentive to my wishes. Just an amazing experience and luckily for me she said "Yes"!< /Text>

<Review>Making one of the most expensive purchases you will make, online, can be nothing short of nerve wracking. However, their partnership with rarecarat.com, their ever present, courteous and knowledgeable associates, make it a very well educated decision. Even for novices. Would highly recommend them - start because of their prices and variety, buy because of their knowledge and courtesy.<//Review>< Pictures>

I purchased the McKinley Ring which turned out beautiful and my fiancé loved. Yadav made the ring and mounted the diamond in about two weeks and I received the ring in well under three weeks. The only problem was the 30 day resized deadline. I didn't propose until a two weeks after I received the ring while I waited for the correct time. The ring was just slightly too big for my fiancés finger but it took a week for two for her to determine that and by then it was pasted the 30 day resize limit.<//Text>

I went here for my engagement ring for my wife. They were able to custom make a design I liked from another jeweler and it was absolutely perfect. We also ended up getting our wedding bands here as well.

They also have great perks that other jewelers can’t consistently match — lifetime resizing and polishing, diamond exchanges at original purchase price, etc.

Highly recommend Yadav to anyone looking for great rings and service.</Text>< Pics>

Great service, prices, and customer service. I ordered some diamonds to go with a ring. I received them and they did not look how I wanted them to. I had to get a return for them. The process for that was easy. They did not give me a hard time about returning them and I was credited very quickly. I ended up ordering another diamond and it was shipped as stated and there were no issues. I would highly recommend them.< /text>

I initially put the stone I was interested in buying in my cart online but didn't complete.  Amelie from their customer service reached out to see if I had questions and also offered a $250 discount. I made the purchase and it was delivered via Fedex in a very nice box and small display case.  The diamond is beautiful and my now fiance loves it. The jeweler who set it said it was a great stone and it was very reasonably priced compared to local jewelers who wanted much higher amounts for lower quality diamonds.< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
Jim is the best! I am so excited to get the diamond in the mail. He is an expert, and compared to other diamond retailers is prices are considerably better. He was so patient with me throughout the process. I strongly advise you to look her before any other site like Blue Nile or James Allen. I spent dozens of hours researching to find the right diamond. Not only was the price better, but there was no tax! Yadav Diamonds is the best out there!< /Review>

I ordered an engagement ring from Yadav and had an excellent experience.  I ordered a 2.22 carat stone with a platinum setting.  Based on my extensive research of the all of the online jewelers, such as James Allen and Blue Nile, I felt Yadav offered a much larger and attractive selection of settings. I was nervous making such a large purchase online, but it all worked out great in the end.  Upon receiving the ring, I took it to a local jeweler to verify it was authentic.  It was the real deal and the jeweler commented on the excellent quality of main stone.  I missed the mark on the ring size on the initial order and we had to send it back a few times to get the size perfect.  Yadav made it easy with prepaid FedEx shipping labels.  They were always gracious about it and never make us feel like it was an inconvenience.  Overall, I feel like we received an excellent price and a quality engagement ring.  In the big picture the temporary sizing issues was well worth the money I saved versus going to a local big named jewelry store.  I can’t imagine what a local jewelry store would have charged me for a similar ring, but suspect at least 40% more based upon my research.< /review>

<review>My experience dealing with Yadav was amazing. I was hesitant to order a diamond online. However, they reached out right away and gave me the peace of mind I needed. I decided to pick up the diamond at their store and that, once again, was a really pleasant experience. The lady that helped me was so nice, and I never felt rushed. They showed me the diamond and I was able to see the GIA inscription. Overall, great customer service!</review>< Pics>

Had a great experience. I bought my diamond online. I was quite skeptical at first making such a large purchase online without seeing the diamond, but the return policy put me at ease. I called in to verify some things and got great service over the phone and the rock was delivered as promised.<//text>

<Review>After going to multiple brick and morter stores and many places online, my (now) wife and I ultimately purchased from Yadav based on their designs and their prices.  We were so satisfied with our purchase that we came back for the wedding band.
If you are considering Yadav, make sure you talk with customer service. the engagement ring we purchased didnt have an advised matching wedding band, but when we talked to CS, they let us know they actually did have one, it just wasn't on the website.<//Review>< pictures>

I had missed the delivery and wanted to pick up the packege at a UPS Customer Service Center instead of waiting for them to attempt a second delivery and the team at Yadav worked very quickly to make it possible.

The engagement ring was even more gorgeous in person than expected, would highly recommend them for all your jewelry needs.

Thank You Yadav Jewelry!</review>< Pictures>

So 5 stars is not enough. I ordered an engagement ring and when I got it I noticed some fluorescence.  Beautiful ring but in bright sunlight it had a slight hint of blue. I called up Yadav and they were very understanding, they told me to send the ring back and order a new diamond of my liking. I was pressed for time and they got me the new diamond in my previously selected setting. The ring is simply gorgeous. A+ customer care A+ speed A+ price A+ quality. Btw all my orders were done online and never went to showroom. Very pleased and will always recommend them.  Also my fiancé wants to buy diamond studs and tennis bracelet from here too.  Thanks Yadav. Lol.  Ha.< /Text>

I was very thorough when looking at Yadav's website, as I am sure most people are when looking to make one of the biggest purchases of their life. The team's communication was great, they were willing to send actual pictures of the stones/bands I was interested in, and were truly concerned with my experience. I would highly recommend buying from Yadav.< /review>

I bought my fiance's engagement ring from Yadav this time last year and I find I keep coming back.  I live on the East Coast but no one around here or online can compete with the quality and price.  I have been back for a tennis bracelet and a wedding band.  The jewelry is beautiful and the diamonds are amazing quality.<//review>

First time jewelry buyer and shopping for an engagement ring. Shopped around all the sites and did my research and kept circling back to yadav. Not only did they have the best pricing but they responded to all my million emails and helped me out a ton. I needed up purchasing an engagement ring and it looks amazing. Great experience and made a scary task enjoyable. Everything is perfect and looks amazing & the lady loves it too! Thanks a ton.< /Text>

I purchased an engagement ring from YADAV. What a great decision. My wife is in love with the "rock", lol. Thank you so much, YADAV! You'll see me again for our anniversary! I'll post the picture of the ring to instagram when we receive our wedding photos. Thanks again!< /review>

My online diamond buying experience was exceptional! It was easy to search for a diamond and setting. I appreciated that they post actual pictures of the diamond along with the GIA certificate. The ring came quickly and it was more beautiful in person. I would highly recommend Yadav Diamonds and Jewelry!<//review>

About a year ago, I bought an engagement ring from Yadav. I did quite a bit of searching using diamond search engines, website searches and local shopping. After all of my searching, I finally went with Yadav. My initial reason for choosing them was the diamond price, but then I quickly realized they had a huge selection of very elegant and high quality rings to go with the stone that I chose. I put the diamond and setting together and made the request to buy. As great as their pricing was their customer service. It seems like from my first click they were on it. Immediate responses, answers to questions and impeccable friendliness and service. This really made me feel good about my choice and took all the complication and concern out of the sale. This was a once in a lifetime purchase and feel really great it was with Yadav. Some diamond studs may soon be in the forecast; I’ll definitely be back on their site shopping before any other. Thanks Yadav, you were great!</Text>

The buying process was simple and uncomplicated but the final ring seemed slightly different from the photos online. The setting that we purchased is called the Hanna. The center stone is a 2 carat cushion which was ours already so we only purchased the setting from Yadav. It’s definitely pretty but it’s just a bit smaller and it seems less large than the photos online. If we’d had more time I probably would’ve returned it but we didn’t. It’s still a lovely ring, it’s just not totally like the online photos. Specifically, in the setting online, we couldn’t see the dots of platinum that are holding in the halo and band diamonds.</review>

<Text>My expectations were far exceeded by Yadav. I put together a stunning engagement ring with a high quality stone at an excellent price. Even the box was a pleasant surprise. My now fiancé was thrilled with the selection. I spent several weeks going through their large inventory of center stones. Nan in customer service answered all of my detailed questions with detailed answers. (I am a very particular person.) She eventually suggested the perfect stone based on my specifications. Maytal went to great lengths to assure my order arrived on time (during COVID). If you are ring shopping, I suggest educating yourself on diamonds and then work with Yadav. I would definitely purchase from them again.<//Text>< pictures>

Update: Added 2 star delivery came in the tail end of window packaged very very well. Communication was pretty lacking and created a bit of uncertainty and doubt on my end so no 4 or 5 star rating from me. Others seem to have solid customer service based on reviews but was pretty average on my end, felt just like ordering a simple item off amazon just a longer delivery process.<//review>

My fiancé bought my engagement ring online through Yadav and I absolutely love it!  After the proposal he told me all the details of the buying process and that it was fantastic.  I was very particular with what I wanted in a diamond, so originally he felt more comfortable going to a store.  So, he made appointments and visited stores here in NC, but wasn't seeing what he wanted at the price point where he wanted to be.  We found the site through Rare Carat; he said that by far Yadav has the best prices, and any worry with buying a ring online went away with their 30 day return policy.  My ring is stunning, and Yadav was there when my he had questions or needed help during the buying process.  He said if given the choice to do it over, he would 100% got back to Yadav.< /text>

I ordered a lab grown certified diamond from Yadav. Being as it was sight unseen and done iver the internet I was a little nervous. Once the diamond came in I took it to my local dealer in Chattanooga. Kennedy Jewelers (Thanks for all your help) they looked the diamond over from top to bottom and was amazed at what I had found. They said the diamond was exactly what I ordered and they gave props to Yadav. This company is ligit. Im 100% satisfied with my purchase.<//Text>

<Review>My son ordered a ring online which can be quite scary, however, as soon as the ring arrived, we had a big sigh of relief! WHAT A DIAMOND! This ring shines incredible and you will absolutely not find a better price at any jewelry store whether online or in your local home town store. I researched for months and months with son to find the perfect ring and no store was able to beat Yadav's prices and the quality. Don't even waste time hunting on the internet. This place IS THE BOMB!!! My son's girlfriend was so thrilled with her ring.
Thank you Yadav for making my son and his girlfriend so very happy.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6nvbRwh2Ccr4Rjh8kTgpc4ekRWKw-Il8mVxry=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

After much research and analysis my wife and I  flew to San Francisco and purchased a Beautiful wedding ring . The staff at Yadav could not be more polite, professional and transparent. It has been the best Jewelry and Diamond buying experience I have ever had and I would highly recommend them to buy any loose Diamond, Lab or Natural , simply the most extensive selection at the best prices with incredible quality standards and incredible level of Assurance and transparency.< /Review>

< Review>
I purchased a diamond online because i was frustrated with the lack of selection in stores in Atlanta. Yadav had a very nice website that allowed me to shop and see the quality of diamonds online. I ordered a beautiful Loose diamond. Customer service was great, shipping was fast, and the packaging was excellent.. and very good quality. I am very happy i found Yadav. Highly recommend.< /Review>

Easy process and best prices ive seen online so far. I had an issue where the diamond I picked was out,  but they helped exchange to another with better price (I also picked, so I don't  think this was a bait and switch).

Thanks!<//Text>

<Date>1546966152256<//Date><text>I was planning to buy a diamond ring for my mom’s birthday, but I didn’t have any knowledge about diamond since I’ve never owned a diamond myself haha.

I was clueless about what/ how to start my research for the diamond, a friend recommended Yadav Jewelry to me. I was overwhelmed by many options they had on their website, so I called their customer service for help.  I was greeted by Christy who was very patient and knowledgeable. She walked me through their website filter to help me find a good quality diamond within my budget.

She gave me lots of ideas such as what shape are the most popular and which setting is stronger. She also told me to pay attention on clarity and fluorescence and explain why they are important factors to choose a diamond.  *Since I really had ZERO knowledge about diamond, this conversation helped a lot! :-)

When I picked up the ring at Yadav store, I couldn’t have been happier to see the ring. It was just what I wanted – a simple and elegant ring for my mom. It was a very pleasant and seamless experience.

Thank you for the excellent service. My mom loves it!< /text><Rate>5<//Rate>< gmapID>

<review>For our 6 year anniversary my husband upgraded my stone.  We purchased our wedding ring from Yadav and the price was right so we came back and we were not disappointed.  We have a stunning custom ring with a one of a kind stone.  The price was highly competitive and communication was constant. This helped us locate and purchase the best stone in the range we wanted  The design team is top notch and fast.  We are very happy with the owner- he  does his best to make things happen for you and on your timeline.

<Text>Terrible service. Would not price match diamonds with the exact same IGI number listed at another retailer. Yadav pricing was almost 30% higher than their competitors but when asked about their written price match guarantee all they would offer was $200 which was a complete joke. When questioned about their policy they stopped replying to all communication.< /Text></record>

If you live in US and want a quality stone at an unbeatable price, dont look beyond Yadav. Everyone wants the most out of there buck, and Yadav's prices are just too good. There customer service and shipping is also very good.
Overall I am an extremely satisfied customer 😊</Text>

< review>
I was referred to this company from a colleague for their high quality and good work.  I spoke with the reps one-on-one and online chat; they were very helpful and knowledgeable.  I inquired about what type of metal my ring should be made of. They listened to my needs and suggested the right metal (14K white gold in my case).  It was an opportunity to "up-sell" me by putting me in a platinum or 18K white gold...but they didn't. After MUCH research, I finally made the purchase from them. It is crafted beautifully and the quality is just as described.  It is really a stunning piece of jewelry. Turn time was accurate and delivered as promised.
It arrived very well protected and came packaged in a very nice quality box and outer shell. The certificate and purchase information was all packaged very neatly as well. Overall a perfect online purchase.  I would order again in a heartbeat.  Most importantly, my bride of over 20 years is THRILLED with the ring!  If you're looking for a way to tell her you'd do it all over again...I highly recommend, no hesitation!</review>

After shopping around extensively, we settled on a GIA 4.2 carat colorless high-quality diamond and made the purchase with Yadav Jewelry.  We are SO THRILLED with this company's service and quality.  The ring is simply magnificent.

Yadav's prices, reliability, and customer service surpass everybody else.  Special THANK YOU to the owner Yair (Jim) who I had the pleasure to speak with on the phone several times.  I could not be happier with our purchase.  I will definitely be back to Yadav Jewelry!!!</text>

They were very highly recommended, so I felt okay dealing with them over the phone/online. I had a fast turnaround time, 4 days to be exact, to get a diamond for an engagement ring I had designed for my fiancé, so I gave them a call.

The initial person I worked with told me the diamond I selected online wouldn’t arrive on time, so he sent me some options matching my specs and had me review and make my decision by the next business day. Once I finally selected my diamond, I worked closely with Maytal to make sure everything went as planned. She was awesome. As expected, the diamond arrived on time and was packaged perfectly. It was amazing and just as wonderful as I could have imagined. The GIA certification was included, as well as some other documentation.

Overall, my experience was great and I highly recommend using Yadav. The prices are reasonable and the service is awesome. I hope to one day purchase more jewelry from here!

Thanks again,
Ryan< /review></record></dataset><record>

Bought sight unseen which astonished all my friends. I’m from NY, so when I tried to wire the money, my bank got nervous with such a large sum. I trusted my gut and bought it. It’s exactly what I paid for. I did get a new setting for it, and was glad to hear from the jeweler here that I had indeed done well for my money.   I plan on upgrading in a few years and definitely will use them again.  Thanks for a beautiful diamond.< /Text>

Honestly, it came out much more impressive than I expected. After finding them via Rarecarat on a Facebook ad, I was impressed by the ease of use and wide selection of the website. The friendliness and helpfulness they showed me via e-mail and over the phone (Sumi) throughout this process has been exceptional and sincerely appreciated. When I finally did place the order, it arrived exactly on the day promised -- packaged surprisingly elegantly. I was a bit apprehensive about spending a boatload of money on the internet on something sight unseen that I have little experience with such as jewelry, but they made the whole experience just that much less painful.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQn_B_TqQOYALlzupDe4IjzgmUuDUnvLMXglln=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpVGWm-_IK1RAmK0Z-ZHbmj2811wwceDpPCOGr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>I was so glad a friend of mine recommended this place! He told me how he looked for a year for the right place, including wholesalers, and couldn't recommend anything other than Yadav.  After searching myself before that tip, I have to agree.  The quality of this place is incredible, and without the markup for high-end jewelry.

Both my friend and I were able to get an engagement ring custom-made, and still at prices far better than other jewelers, even wholesalers.  Besides the price, and getting the perfect ring that didn't seem possible elsewhere, Yadav is just a knowledgeable, friendly, and honest person.< /text>< resp>

I searched all over the internet for the perfect diamond engagement ring, and ultimately, Yadav had a fantastic deal on a beautiful diamond and a perfect setting for it. The ring came out beautifully and my fiancée absolutely loves it. They also have great customer service. Couldn’t be happier with my purchase!</review>

This review is specifically for the online side of Yadav.

BUY WITH CONFIDENCE. Amazing. Absolutely incredible. You will be warned by all your local jewelers not to buy a stone online- that seeing it in person is the ONLY way to know if it's a good stone.

I will personally vouch for Yadav. The stones they advertise come in at 40% cheaper than a comparable stone (on paper) as from a local jeweler. I took the stone I purchased to that local jeweler who repeatedly told me I would regret buying online. They put it through every inspection they could think of to try and show that I could have done better buying the stone locally, but in the end all they could do was shrug and tell me what a beautiful stone I got at such an incredible price.

They sell a superior product for a better price. They stand behind it. They take care of their customers. BUY WITH CONFIDENCE. You won't regret it.<//Text>

< Review>
I purchased some jewelry through Yadav with a custom selected stone. It was easy, very smooth process. There was some miscommunication with whatever company actually had the stone, first they said it wasn't available, then it was, then it wasn't. No fault on the part of Yadav. They were in contact with me the whole time and sent me alternative stones. The owner himself even called me to explain what the mix-up was with the seller. I ended up cancelling the order and they had my money refunded within 24 hours. The owner again called me to apologize after. I would absolutely try and buy from them again. Their customer service was one of the best I'd ever seen.<//Review>

< review>
My now fiancé was adamant about finding the most PERFECT diamond. It took him a few months looking for my diamond at a reasonable price. He found Yadav on Rarecarat after searching for the specs he wanted. When I looked myself, I saw yadav had plenty of choices when it came to diamonds. Yadav made ring shopping easier as they already had a variety of setting to choose from. Anyways, I could not be happier with my ring. My fiancé did an amazing job picking out my diamond and setting. I told him I wanted a matching wedding ring too. My fiancé is so proud of himself because he catches me staring at my ring all the time. He is happy that I’m happy with my ring. We also liked that Yadav had choices on what type of metal to use for the setting. I’ve had my ring for almost two months. The ring is very comfortable and the diamonds glisten so much. It’s blinding!!! We are so happy with Yadav. As far as communication, my fiancé had no problem reaching out to them, as we did live in Los Angeles. Thank you Yadav!< /review>

< Review>
GO TO JAMES ALLEN. My fiance got my original engagement ring from here. At first I was in love but then we quickly started to realize that my band had tons of imperfections. We contacted Yadav and they paid for the shipping back. We received the ring back after about a week and it still had  several imperfections on the band. Yadav said they would send us a new band to inspect and if we liked that one better then we could ship the band and the ring back to switch the diamond. Well, we thought wow great customer service until when we received the new band it was a COMPLETELY different one. So, we then asked for a full refund because at this point this had been going on for a month. They were very professional about the refund. We then went to James Allen. It was AMAZING. My new ring has 0 imperfections and they honestly had better prices.</Review>

They have a huge selection of diamonds to fit your need and very good prices.

I highly recommend Yadav.  They're selling high quality diamonds at an incredibly honest price!</Text>< Resp>

The website was super easy to use and we really loved how we could choose the diamond and setting. The process was easy and the price was fantastic. The ring looked wonderful online and it's 100 times better in person. I had a question about the diamond after the order and was met with an immediate answer that was helpful and very polite. The only bad thing is I don't have more business to give them. I wish they were someone that I had to business with all the time because it was a pleasure. Buy with confidence. The jewelry is very high quality, anyone claiming otherwise is a fool.<//review>

I am from Bulgaria and here the people are skeptic about buying from the internet. Especially when it comes to a diamond ring!! I've decide to trust Yadav team and to put in their hands my engagement. And I was not disappointed - extremely beautiful ring, with BIG and beautiful diamond - and this for 1/5 of the price in Bulgaria!
Again recommended with two hands! Do not hesitate to trust Yadav and buy your precious one ring from here!!!< /review>

<review>I was thrilled about the service from Jim and team at Yadav Jewelry! At first, I was a little skeptical about making such a purchase online, but after building up confidence with multiple phone calls to the store, I did not regret my decision. The ring setting is gorgeous, and the diamond itself is absolutely stunning. Not only does my fiance love it, but everyone she has shown it to is very impressed and complimentary. 10/10. I would buy from yadav again!< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Bought engagement ring from Yadav. Super easy to find the right ring and customer service is top notch. Had time constraints on the delivery and they overnighted the ring to me for no charge. Also had to have the ring re-sized and again, no problems. They emailed me the shipping label and all we had to do was package it well and send it off. Came back within a week with notifications along the way. Great company to work with.<//Text><Response>None</Response>< user_id>

I ordered my fiancée’s ring from Yadav online. The ring arrived right on-time in secure packaging with every last document included. When we found the ring to be slightly too big, Yadav handled all the shipping back and forth to ensure the ring was perfect. She loves the ring and that means everything to me! Thank you Yadav; you guys are a class act.<//text>

<Review>I have to admit I was a little worried about the wait but it was worth every second. This is a true diamond dealer not some generic mark up jeweler taking advantage of "super ideal" B.S. They sent me the EXACT GIA certified diamond I paid for not some lower cut substitute. The diamond I purchased scored a 9.5 on the HCA calculator & I paid triple EX price I feel like I stole the damn diamond. I'll wait the two weeks & continue business with Yadav Diamonds as long as these prices stay honest.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d< /Gmap_id></record>

I would recommend Yadav to absolutely anyone. My (now) fiancee' and I did some browsing at a few local shops to get an idea of what she wanted. Knowing that I could find better pricing online, I found Jim's showroom in San Francisco through Rare Carat. Jim had some of the best prices I could find and I decided to go in for a visit.

I provided Jim w/ a very specific list of what I was looking for and he brought in multiple diamonds he thought would make sense. Although I ultimately decided to buy a diamond online through his website, Jim stayed very involved throughout the process and didn't hesitate to give me HONEST feedback about the options that I picked out, all the while giving off 0% pressure about making a purchase.

The diamond I picked out shipped to the showroom within a few days and I came in for a 2nd visit to view it, pick out the perfect setting, and waited a couple hours for the jeweler to finish the ring. I couldn't have asked for a better experience and definitely plan to take my soon-to-be wife back for her wedding band.

Jim is phenomenal and Layla, his customer service do-it-all gal, provided exceptional & extremely responsive customer service along the way. Thanks again to the whole crew at Yadav, things couldn't have gone better!<//Text>

Jim is the best jeweler alive!  He is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful.  My fiance purchased my engagement ring from Jim and he and Layla have been so helpful in finding a matching band for myself and a wedding band for our upcoming wedding.  The customer service at Yadav's is truly something to experience, right from selecting a stone to actually receiving a finished product.  The best part is that Jim is so accommodating in terms of one's preference; making it truly a unique experience! Must check him out for yourself!<//text>

<Review>I don't often write reviews, and will usually delete the emails asking that I do, but Yadav (via rarecarat) is awesome.  The ring I got through them was brilliant and affordable relative to the brick and mortar retail environment.

It was slightly too big so we had to send it back for resizing (free).  We live on the East Coast, Yadav is on the West Coast.  I sent it back on a Thursday and received it back in our hands before the next Friday.

5 stars.<//Review>< pics>

The ring itself is gorgeous but the issue is the people who work here. We told them our budget and exactly what we were interested in and that was not respected at all. We left the store because of how ridiculously obvious they didn't care about what we could and could not afford. We built the ring online and picked it up from them. They sent us two emails stating how horrible the ring will look and how they wouldn't return it if there was an issue with it. Honestly, go either online and don't bother going in if you REALLY want this brand OR better yet, go elsewhere!< /Review>

<Text>I would highly recommend considering Yadav based on my experience so far if you are shopping for the perfect ring. I was considering bluenile or jamesallen when I accidentally bumped into Yadav.
I did some research online on their very easy to use and informative site and was able to narrow down some choices with their prompt customer service. One challenge with any online purchase is the fact you don't get to see exactly what you are buying though the site does do a good job of providing detailed views and provide additional images on request plus 30 days return policy made me very comfortable.
So far my experience has been very positive, from research to shortlisting to pricing to making a purchase and post purchase support. Time will tell about craftmanship and quality.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Jim and Layla are absolutely amazing to work with and really patient. I cant take my eyes off the ring that my fiance got me. So when ordering his ring, I was stubborn enough to stick with Jim's workmanship even though they are not open Saturday's anymore. (we did visit about 20 stores in the bay area but the service just didn't feel right).
Have you ever shown someone a picture of a ring and ordered it over email and phone calls? We did just that. And it looks better than what I actually took a pic of. There are no salesmen here to deal with (who might change by the next time you visit). It's Jim's business so you know he is putting his name behind every product he sells. the prices are really reasonable. no crazy markups etc.  Where I am from in india, the culture is to have a local jeweler you trust more than chain jewelers and I have found my local jeweler here :)

Helpful customer service, good selection and price.  Purchased a ring from Yadav online that was going to be my backup option, ended it up liking it better than the other one and saved myself $1100 at the same time!  Nice packaging as well.  Have already recommended Yadav to others.<//Review>

<Review>My experience with Yadav was awesome. The center stone that I chose was 50% better priced than local brick and mortar. Also they had a wider selection and variety. The best part is after my purchase I was worried about the color and configuration that I had selected and YADAV was responsive and emailed me back with good insights for every question that I had. They even gave me their opinion when I asked for it. When the ring came I could not be more satisfied. Their comments were spot on. I ordered a 2CT center stone with an I color, which I thought would look too yellow. They assured me against a gold band that I would not notice the color one bit. Non, the service rep I was dealing with was fantastic. We plan on going to Yadav in person to get our wedding bands!< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d<//gmap_id></record>

My husband and I upgraded my engagement ring on our 5th year anniversary. It is a solitaire diamond in a Tiffany setting (six prong). Yadav had the most competitive pricing by a long shot. Seriously... no comparison!

Shopping for the ring was a very enjoyable experience thanks to Jim! We knew what we wanted and he made it happen (accompanied by champagne, cheese and crackers). The diamond and setting was finished in a week. I'm so happy we used Yadav and would definitely go there again for any high end jewelry! I would recommend Yadav to anyone looking for the best price on any high end pieces.  Thank you, Jim!</Review>

After numerous hours of shopping for an engagement ring, I chose Yadav based on their reviews and pricing. I'm so glad I did. I saved thousands on the diamond itself compared to the local retailers, and the ring is absolutely stunning. The detail in the custom engraving is awesome, and it's honestly one of the nicest engagement rings I've seen. Oh, and she said yes, so that's a plus too!<//Review>

I was skeptic of buying diamonds online but hopefully this will ease a few minds.  Lauren B RS-279 quoted 8600 for 1.1 carat G color vs1 clarity.  I found 1.2 carat D color vs2 clarity on Yadav for 4000.  I asked him to custom make a ring that wasn't on his website so it would look like the lauren b ring and he quoted 1800 more for the ring.  They even sent me the 3D image of the ring so I could see what was happening each step of the way.  The ring came out beautiful.  Got the ring appraised because I was so skeptic of the deal, everything matched exactly as advertised, color, size, clarity, etc and even the side diamonds were a better color than what was promised.  I was shocked when they valued it at 12000 when I only paid 5800.  Could not be happier with the entire experience.< /text>

The ring is perfect! Even better, Layla is the best ever with excellent communication and great customer service! I ran through trouble picking up my ring via UPS because of missing the delivery to different address on my ID. But in the end, she was there to help me regardless! Thank you!<//Text>

I just received my future Fiances engagement ring from Yadav this morning. The ring is perfect and exceeded my expectations. I was a little reluctant to do business with a jeweler that I found online but Yadav really surprised me. They were professional and extremely helpful right from the start . Layla made the whole process extremely easy and I felt very comfortable with how she handled things. I will definitely be a return customer of Yadav diamond and Jewelry.< /review>

Yadav is a honest and responsive business with good diamond and attitude but bad contractor for their rings. Me and my bf are planning to get engaged so I was looking for an engagement diamond online and found one that I like offered by Yadav. A bit on online diamonds: nowadays there's a ton of online diamond website, I think it's basically worth it to get diamonds online cuz the mark-up in physical shops are crazy, but since online diamond stores don't profit that much from their diamonds they may try to make that up by selling slightly over-priced settings. And even among online stores some are more expensive than others, like I think brilliant earth is more expensive than others; the same diamond may get listed on different store's website, like the one I picked was on Yadav and another online store called `with clarity', but Yadav's price is better, so I went with Yadav. Another funny thing is that although Yadav's diamond is cheaper than the other store, the setting is cheaper on the other store's website than Yadav's, so overall the market seems to be quite efficient. So I think the best strategy is to buy the diamond you like from the cheapest website online, and find a local physical jewelry shop to buy a setting. The mistake I made was buying a setting with Yadav: 1) it's expensive: $550 for 18k white gold solitaire setting 2) the first time they gave me a ring of the wrong size and wrong material (14 k instead of 18k) and 3) the second time they did ship me the ring size and material ring, but the diamond is clearly not set in the dead-center of the ring, and the 4 prongs of the ring were not equally spaced, so the ring looked very ugly. But they were super responsive and responsible during the whole process- they always reply email the next day, and they did stand up to what they promised - free return within 30 days with no question asked, and they gave me pre-paid shipping label with insurance on the shipping. I think what happened is that their business model is just to cut cost as much as possible so that they can earn money even when selling diamond at low margin, so they basically find the cheapest contractor out there to make their rings, which means their rings are poor-quality. So I would suggest buying diamond from them but not the ring, and find local jewelry shop to get a ring setting and set the diamond.<//Text>

Great service, excellent pricing.  Ended up returning a ring I had already purchased after finding the perfect diamond on the Yadav website.  The ring was appraised, set and sent in under two weeks.  Excellent company to do business with, thank-you!!</Review>

Quality products at very competitive price.

At first, I was hesitant to purchase a diamond ring online but after reading all reviews and talking to them a few times over the phone I took the plunge.  I'm glad I did and my wife loves the ring.<//Text>

Buying a diamond is a scary thing, especially online. The wonderful team at Yadav worked with us and made the experience so easy! They accepted partial payments until the diamond was completely paid for. The stone arrived overnight and was taken to a jeweler for inspection. It appraised for well over what we paid and matched the GIA report. If you have any reservations about buying online, rest assured that this is the right choice; you cannot beat the deal and service! Thank you, Yadav!</text>

< Review>
I used rare carat to find the diamond I wanted. That website broke down the best deals on diamonds by price based on the color, carat size, clarity, cut, and certification desired. You were then able to click on the diamond to see see a zoomed in view of the diamond which made picking one easy. Yadav was one of three websites offering the diamond I chose. Based on the diamond chose I was then able to pick the type of setting I wanted. They provided me with several options to choose from, where the other websites provided few options. The price of each setting was displayed and an image of what the diamond would look like was displayed.

Yadav offers a 30 day money back guarantee which is awesome. They’ll also resize the ring for free, which I won’t get to use because my fiancée won’t take the ring off. They offer several options to pay. The cost of the diamond using this process was less than half what a diamond of equal size, certification, cut, color and lesser clarity would have cost at Kay or any of the other large retailers. Most importantly my fiancée loves it. Awesome website. Highly recommend using it.< /Review>

<Text>I shopped around for some time before finding Yadav. They have a great selection, incredible pricing and a very user-friendly website that made the whole diamond buying experience enjoyable. The Diamond was shipped quickly and in discrete pacakaging. Myself, and especially my fiancé, are thrilled with the diamond.

Super helpful customer service, and beautiful stones and rings. My now fiance cried when she saw it, and I'm pretty sure it was out of happiness. The prices are extremely fair as well, I shopped for the stone using rare carat and found that Yadav had the nicest stones and the best deals amongst all the jewelers available.< /Text>

<Name>ismet merdzic<//Name><Date>1523457163821</Date><rate>5</rate><Review>After deciding to pop the question I shopped around local jewelers and on other online stores. However I was skeptical of making such an important purchase online and without seeing it in person but after reading all the reviews and speaking to their team I felt more at ease. The service I received by the Yadav team was exceptional, between all the questions I had through countless email and phone calls they answered them all seamlessly. They had the ring I picked out made, the diamond set, and shipped on the promised time frame. When I got the ring I took it in to a Diamonds Direct store to compare to a second ring a had on hold there and they just couldn’t compete. Yadav ring was higher in quality, bigger center stone, better in clarity, and for a faction of the price. Diamonds Direct priced the 1 carat, H in color, VS1 diamond I got from Yadav $2100 more than I paid for the lose diamond it self. Both my fiancé and I couldn’t be happier with it and the countless compliments she gets on her ring. Thank you Yadav Jewelers.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I would recommend Yadav Jewelry to everyone. The quality is top-notch and their prices are the best around. I stumbled upon Yadav through Rare Carat. The prices for the diamond I was looking for were hundreds of dollars cheaper than the more well known websites and even local jewelery stores.

I (and my now fiancee) was blown away by the quality of the diamond and the ring. The smile it puts on her face every time she looks at it, it's worth every penny and more. Yadav took an intimidating process and made it easier than one could reasonably ask. Yadav has my trust and business for life.<//text><rating>5</rating>< username>

<review>I cannot imagine a better diamond buying experience and will absolutely work with Yadav again. I looked at about a dozen stores for an engagement ring (mostly online but two local jewelers as well) and settled on yadav because they had the best price for the stone/setting combo I was looking for. The purchase process was extremely smooth and went as expected. I was short on time because I was leaving on a trip where I hoped to propose so they got the diamond in early, mounted it and sent someone to meet me on thanksgiving at SFO to hand deliver it because UPS wouldn't make it in time. The hand delivery on a holiday was really above and beyond and showed me their commitment to doing everything they could to make a customer happy.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>I purchased a loose Canadian diamond that was at a better price than I found anywhere else. I made a mistake with my payment method, and they helped me fix it quickly.

The gem came as advertised with the GIA grading certificate and CanadaMark documentation. When I had it installed on a ring, the jeweler confirmed that it was accurately graded and had the CanadaMark engraving.< /Review>< pics>

Buying and importing a diamond from overseas was probably one of the most stressful experiences in my life (so far anyway). However, the staff at Yadav look after you from beginning to end, and they won't stop until you're completely satisfied. They respond to all email correspondence and phone calls very promptly, and they go above and beyond to deliver outstanding service. Thank you for all your help!< /Text>

Yadav is an elite jeweler.  Jim offers top notch products and exceptional customer service.  I purchased my engagement ring from Yadav and the ring looks absolutely stunning.  More importantly, Yadav's customer service blew me away.  I made a critical error listing my shipping address yet Yadav responded quickly and efficiently and got the ring to me days before I popped the question.  I will always come to Yadav first for my future jewelry needs!<//text>

<time>1511939663164<//time><rating>5</rating><Text>It was specific. Rose gold with my fiancé's grandmother's pear-shaped diamond. There wasn't a local jewelry store that had what I was looking for. Then a friend recommended Yadav. Within a quick search, I found exactly what I was looking at the right price! It was a huge relief. But wait, there's more! The customer service was by-far the best. Very friendly, understanding of my needs and time crunch. They sent me the ring and I was able to not only propose, but my fiancé said that the ring was..."PERFECT!" Stress no more. I will always recommend Yadav.<//Text>< Pictures>

After doing a ton of research online, I purchased an engagement ring from Yadav. The ring was delivered on schedule and most importantly it is beautiful. I had an appraisal done for insurance purposes and it assessed significantly higher than the purchase price.</Text>

I purchased a diamond through Yadav after finding them on a site called RareCarat and ended up extremely pleased with the outcome. There was a bit of an unexpected delay due to one of Yadav's suppliers, but the company owned up to it and made up for the issue. Would recommend.< /Review>

<date>1548965340318< /date><rate>5< /rate><text>The ring was beautiful and the diamond is great, but there is fire scale/discoloration on the ring after only 5 months. The ring was 18K yellow gold, and the soldered joints are turning a rose gold color. We confirmed with a local jeweler that the ring should not be turning this color; it should've been fused, not soldered. I expressed my disappointment with Yadav, and their response was that the discoloration was due to normal wear and tear (in 5 months!), and offered to polish the ring if we paid $70 to ship it back to them. I replied that the discoloration was not due to normal wear and tear but was in fact due to poor craftsmanship. That email was sent on November 16th, and I have not received a reply, hence this review.

UPDATE 1: I have head back from the owner; they agreed to pay to ship the ring back and check it out, so they have worked to rectify the situation. As such, I have adjusted my rating to 3 stars, and we'll see how the situation gets solved ultimately.

UPDATE 2: After back and forth, I was contacted by the owner, who agreed to pay to ship the ring back. Assumedly, they inspected the setting and determined the setting needed to be replaced. I believe they had a knew one built (although that was never made clear to me) and shipped it back. I believe the process took about 3 weeks.

We are satisfied with the service and my fiance gets compliments on the ring very often. I would recommend Yadav to a purchaser; if there are issues, they will fix them, you just have to stay on them.</text>< pics>

The chat feature for quick questions was amazing.
Guaranteed communication made me very confident in my purchase.
I couldn't be more than happy with the entire process.
I feel strongly that I ended up with a much higher quality diamond that I would have ended up with at a local jeweler.
I had to guess on size and I was off.  Shipping it back, having it resized, and getting it back all within a weeks time?  Amazing!!!
Keep up the great work @diamondsonweb< /Review>

Yadav is truly amazing. I found them through Rare Carat online. Naturally I was hesitant making such a large purchase online without seeing the diamond in person, but I went through dozens of reviews and decided to go for it. I could not be happier. Their website is very user friendly and there online support staff was amazing. I must have asked a million questions in their chat feature, and every one of them was answered quickly and efficiently. In addition, I was on a very strict schedule as far as when I needed the ring by, and they worked with me and got me the ring in less than two weeks from my purchase date all the way out to the east coast! Now for the ring! I was blown away when I saw it. Stunning! The Tami setting that I picked out is fantastic and was perfectly sized to what I requested. The woman who is now my fiancée loves it. The diamond sparkles so incredibly, and is so clear. The price was mindblowing. This is the first jeweler I have ever dealt with where I feel like I got way more than I paid for. Great prices! I didn't have to cut any corners and still got a beautiful ring! I will be a permanent customer for Yadav from now on! Thank you!< /text>

<Text>I am Yadav's client since 2013 and have a great experience with Jim, Layla and Karen.
Their customer service is excellent. They alway listen to you carefully and do their best to accommodate your wish with any budget you have. Jim is one of the most honest people I have ever known. One of his advantage versus any other jewelry stores or diamond wholesalers is that he gives you plenty of time to think and make a right decision for your diamond selection. I studied a lot about diamonds and visited over 10 jewelry stores and also diamond-wholesalers but couldn't find anyone to give me a better price than him. You can trust Yadav, you won't be regret.</Text>< Name>

<Review>I cannot recommend Jim and Layla with Davy Diamonds and Jewelry strongly enough.  I set (5) appointments at the Jewelry Mart and by far Jim was the best. He was patient and listened intently to what I was looking for.  My ring design was very specific.  He had just the stone for my fiance.  Equally as good was the communication with Layla in the office. She was easy to reach and her follow through was exceptional. When my fiance came in to get it fitted, the entire team (including Mr. Fu) recognised us and celebrated in our special moment.  Jim will be a jeweller for life !!!</Review>< pics>

<Text>My fiance and I found Yadav online using rare carat and while we were wary about buying an engagement ring site unseen, the prices, positive reviews, and return policies convinced us to give it a shot. We decided to purchase just the loose diamond first so that I could shop for settings in person and see how they looked on my hand. The jeweler we originally chose for a setting ooo-ed and aaah-ed at how amazing the diamond was but then tried to argue that it wouldn't fit the setting we liked and that we should buy a lesser diamond from them. The price they quoted was more than double what we paid on Yadav for a lower cut, color, and clarity.

In the end we chose a nicer setting from Yadav and couldn't be happier. It was made in exactly my ring size and the setting fits the diamond we chose perfectly. The compliments keep pouring in.<//Text></record>

<review>Recently purchased a GIA diamond + setting with Yadav and it was a fantastic experience overall. I did weeks of research and found exactly what I wanted at Yadav at a very competitive price (it was second lowest) and went with them due to the good reviews. They customized the setting without additional cost and honored an online coupon as well. I wired over money and received an additional discount. On top of this, the price of the diamond actually dropped before the wire completed and they provided me a price adjustment refund!!! Diamond arrived packaged very well and it was overnight shipped via fedex and coulnd't be happier. The only complaint I would have is sometimes they didn't provide updates on what was going on and I had to call/email to find out, but otherwise I definitely am very happy with my experience and recommend to anyone on the fence, even if you're not able to visit in person (I'm on the east coast).</review>< pictures>

I needed a quick turn-around and they were able to do that for me. The diamond was beautiful. After seeing the setting in person, we decided to send it back and get a different one (that she liked better). They did that quickly and actually ended up crediting me $40 because the new setting was cheaper. Pleasure to work with for the purchase of a lifetime.<//Review>< pictures>

<user_name>Joe Charles<//user_name><time>1523370930712< /time><rating>5<//rating><text>Yadav was recommended to me by a friend who likes to do meticulous research on things before buying them. I wasn't nervous about buying a diamond online necessarily, but I was unsure of how it would work, since the last time I bought a diamond, I went from store to store looking at loose diamonds until I found the right one.

I called Yadav and they assured me on the phone that they would overnight the diamond, and if it wasn't to my liking, I could just send it back, on their dime. What did I have to lose?

Yadav's website made it very easy to search through many different diamonds at once. You can enter in various search criteria in terms of cost, quality, etc., and then you can look at each actual diamond and its associated GIA report (if applicable). Most came with a full 360-view video, and I found this to be very easy to see any defect/inclusions at different angles.

Once I selected a diamond, it was overnighted to me, double-boxed in a standard large UPS priority box, with no obvious signage on the outside that the box contained anything of significant value. The return address did not even mention that it came from a jewelry store.

In my case, the diamond was exactly what was displayed online, down to every last detail. There were no unexpected surprises. What I saw was what I got, and it was stunning!

Fantastic quality at an amazing price. I am 100% satisfied, and would recommend Yadav to anyone looking for a diamond.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<Text>I purchased my fiancee a color E VVS Excellent 1 carat diamond and its so far the best quality in the same grade. The price is very afforadble comparing to the market. Shipping is extremly secure, they literally put 5 ups and fedex boxes with separate postages on each box over another. Signature required indeed. When i had a few questions on the diamond gradings, the manager did not heistate to help with all her patience. I highly recommend this jewler to every man who is shopping for their loved one.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Recently purchased an engagement ring from YADAV and I have to say I was very impressed with it. I was working with a tight window and they were more than happy to help get it to me within reasonable time. I highly recommend YADAV to anyone who's looking for for quality jewelry.</Review>

When I found the diamond that I wanted, YADAV worked with me to create a custom setting that matched my girlfriend's tastes. I had very specific requirements and YADAV did a fantastic job in managing my needs. I am very happy with the service that I received, and especially grateful to Layla who served as my go-to contract during the whole process. I would highly recommend YADAV.<//text>

< Review>
Amazing experience. I spent weeks if not months researching online diamond/engagement ring companies and finally purchased an engagement ring from a competitor of Yadav.  I anxiously awaited its arrival only to open the package and feel a sinking sense of disappointment with the quality of the setting and the size of the center stone.  However, given my lengthy search, I was unsure that I would be able to find anything that I felt was a better option. After thinking about it, I decided to make a final effort to find another ring and ordered the Zadie ring from Yadav with a 2.03 carat H, VVS1 center stone. When the ring finally arrived, I opened the package somewhat hesitantly, afraid that I would have spent more time and money for naught. But all those feelings faded immediately when I laid eyes on the beautiful piece of craftsmanship that I had received.  I knew I had found “the one” and It far exceeded my expectations.  All I can say is thank you Yadav for allowing me to acquire such a beautiful piece of jewelry that will be a foundation of my future marriage.  By providing such high quality products at an incredibly affordable price, you have made at least one young couple very happy and very grateful.< /Review>

< review>
Before I got engaged to my girlfriend, I had always wondered why diamonds meant so much. After learning about diamonds, and receiving guidance from Jim and the rest of Yadav, I found a new appreciation for diamonds and their incredible nature. The ring I purchased is a perfect symbol of my love for my fiancé.

I am forever appreciative of Yadav’s help in choosing the ring of my fiancé’s dreams. They were patient throughout the entire process, responsive to all emails and calls, and went the extra mile to finish the ring in a very short period of time.

There was incredible transparency throughout the entire process, and I will 100% go back to Yadav for all future jewelry. Incredible people, incredible talent. I highly recommend them!</review>

<Text>If you want to buy a diamond or an engagement ring come see Jim.

I was looking for a very specific oval diamond and was not having any luck with jewelry stores or even other places in the giftcenter & jewelrymart. All the jewelry showrooms were pushy, didn't have much selection, and worst of all had high prices. I came to Jim's office based on his yelp reviews and he was able to find a few stones that matched my exact requirements and had them in his office two days later! His prices were fair (just as good as online) and I got to see the diamond in person. I also had him make a custom engagement ring which only took 7 business days and my Fiancée couldn't be happier with it!

Jim has great prices, very fast service, and isn't a pushy jewelry store.</Text><response>None</response>< Rating>

<text>When my fiancé was shopping for a ring/diamond, we got the feeling that traditional jewelry stores were not giving us the best deal. We heard some people warn us to shopping online for diamonds, but we decided to look into it anyways. After doing extensive research we were impressed with Yadav's reviews and found a loose diamond that was perfect for us - and such a great deal.

We still were wary that it might be "too good to be true," but saw they were accredited by the BBB and that the diamonds were certified by GIA. We ordered and had a good experience. The lady even recommended that we should have our diamond inspected upon its arrival. When the diamond arrived we took it to a local jeweler to ensure that the serial number matched the GIA report and everything matched up, and the diamond was beautiful and just like the high res pictures we'd seen online.

Any friends getting engaged we recommend to use Yadav and get the most of their money. We wouldn't have been able to get something near as nice at this price at any of the local jewelry stores.< /text>< date>

<Text>I found Yadav through Rare Carat, and couldn't have been happier about my diamond search and the transaction. While there was a slight question between the diamond shown in the search results and in the specific details, a phone call with an employee helped resolve the issue.  I was sent details and confirmed the photo of the diamond, and it came exactly as expected. I will use Yadav again someday and would recommend them to others looking for a stone/ring.</Text></record>

Me acerque a Yadav por un anillo para mi prometida, a la cual le encanto, excelente calidad sin necesidad de romper el presupuesto. Definitivamente volveré para próximas compras.
