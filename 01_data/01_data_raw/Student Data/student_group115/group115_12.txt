It has changed my life. I was 2 and spent 3 months there. Great experience! Excellent books, methods and teachers. Definitely recommend them. I want to visit one day. By the photos it is quite the same. Happy environment. Of course a business open for over 30 years can only be very good.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80d954a778f8126f:0xc0c091544b693d67<//gmap_id></record>

< review>
#Flashback I was in San Diego, California for 5 months improving my English from February 11 to July 1, 2018. IT was just AMAZING. The city is wonderful, where you can visit a lot of beautiful places and meet a lot of people. I lived in little Italy and went to Converse in Downtown. I had received recommandations from 3 friends who have studied here, and they were right ; It is probably the best school in SD.

First of all, the staff is very friendly and always available. Tamara, the director of the school, is always here if you need help. Joseph, is at the same time the Assistant Academic Manager and an excellent teacher (I was lucky to follow his lessons for 3 months) too. If you have any question, you can ask Heather at the reception, she is always smiling and happy. Sonya is the activities coordinator, thanks to her, I could do skydiving and surfing. She is so sweet !

Finally, Jessica will help you if you want to change classes or lessons. During these 5 months, I definitely improved my English, because of the lesson's quality and the availability of the staff when you want to practice, practice and practice your english :) So don't be shy and talk with them because they could give you a lot of advice about food, places and activities !

For all of the reasons, I definitely recommend you CISL and San Diego. It was the best experience of my life ; I have realized my dream of living in the US for a while, and I don't have regrets, or, maybe yes, just one : I should have stayed more time ! I miss these guys, and I will be back soon to visit them !

See you soon CISL

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>It was totally amazing experiences in San Diego! I could have so many chances to practice English with teachers and classmates. Cause there were only 4 students in my class! That was unbelievable!
I took Cambridge English classes at Converse and I would highly recommend this class for everyone who would like to learn and practice English properly. It was great opportunity to improve my speaking, listening and writing skills. Thanks to my teacher Joseph (I miss you so bad Joseph! You are the best teacher ever I have met.. seriously) I could feel confident and get used to using proper English as time went by.
I think I was so fortunate to get really good memories there. I miss all of you! Especially so many activities with Sonya were definitely unforgettable experiences for me. She was so friendly and nice. Converse has so good Activity plans and they try to make it every month differently for all of the students. Those were so enjoyable and I had fun with Sonya! I hope I can visit there again someday and have fun with teachers once again. Take care, guys!</Text>< pictures>

<text>I was at the CISL from March 2018 to June 2018 and I had such a good time. I was in the Cambridge Course (FCE) and I had the best teacher ever. Joseph help us with everything and I felt never lost or uncomfortable. The activities with the school are super cool and all the people are very kind and helpful. I would recommend the CISL to everyone how wants to go to San Diego in a language school. It was one of the best experience in my life.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<Text>On the one hand, Converse International School of Language is a very serious and very concerned about their students and about increase their english level. On the other hand, CISL is an amaziong school where they worry a lot to show you the city organizing extra activities for free in the afternoon where you have the posibility to continue practicing English with more international students and teachers at the same time you do amazing things around the city.
Thanks for everything and I hope to come back next year!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) It was the best exchange experience I could have, I was very well received and I tried to make the most of the immersion in the English language, the advantage that no one from the management speaks in Portuguese with you in an emergency the students help you, it helps you develop better , and my hostmother was the best I could have said ... I just missed it, if I could have stayed there for about three months, I would certainly have had better results.

(Original)
Foi a melhor experiência que poderia ter de intercâmbio, fui super bem recebida e procurei aproveitar o máximo possível a imersão na língua inglesa , a vantagem que ninguém da direção fala em português contigo em uma emergência os alunos te auxilia, isso ajuda a se desenvolver melhor, e a minha hostmother  foi a melhor que eu poderia ter dito... Só fiquei na saudade, se eu pudesse teria ficado uns três meses lá, teria com certeza tido melhores resultados.</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) We are French and our children have been participating in the Converse International School of Language junior summer camps for several years. They usually leave for 3 weeks in July and always come back delighted… with a great American accent. Since 2015, they have stayed at the Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New Haven campuses. The next trip will certainly be to San Diego. I would add that they never wanted to go to the same campus together so as not to be tempted to stay together. On the other hand, during each stay they befriended other young people from all continents and several years later, they still correspond with some.
CISL's programs are well balanced with English classes in the morning and activities in the afternoon. The price of the internships is not excessive because the courses are of high quality, the supervision is very friendly and the accommodation on the university campuses is great. Most importantly, our kids loved going to amusement parks, exploring Hollywood, surfing in Santa Monica, and sightseeing in New York or San Francisco.
In short, at the end of a stay at the ICFTU, the children speak English, learn more about American culture and have had the best vacation of their lives. A great experience!

Last clarification: for those under 15 who are traveling as Unaccompanied minors with Air France, Converse sends a manager to the airport to pick up the young person on arrival. For the others a taxi awaits them. Everything is planned!

(Original)
Nous sommes français et nos enfants participent aux camps d’été juniors de Converse International School of Language depuis plusieurs années. Ils partent en général 3 semaines au mois de juillet et reviennent toujours enchantés…avec un super accent américain. Depuis 2015, ils ont séjourné sur les campus de Washington, de Los Angeles, de San Francisco et de New Haven. Le prochain voyage sera certainement pour San Diego. Je précise qu’ils n’ont jamais voulu partir ensemble sur un même campus pour ne pas être tentés de rester entre eux. Par contre, à chaque séjour ils se sont liés d’amitié avec d’autres jeunes venus de tous les continents et  plusieurs années après, ils correspondent encore avec certains.
Les programmes du CISL sont bien équilibrés avec des cours d’anglais le matin et des activités l’après-midi. Le prix des stages n’est pas excessif car les cours sont de grande qualité, l’encadrement est très sympa et l’hébergement dans les campus des universités est génial. Mais surtout, nos enfants ont adoré les sorties dans les parcs d’attraction, la découverte d’Hollywood, le surf à Santa Monica et les visites de New York ou de San Francisco.
En résumé, à la fin d’un séjour au CISL, les enfants parlent anglais, connaissent mieux la culture américaine et ont passé les plus belles vacances de leur vie. Une super expérience !

Dernière précision : pour les – de 15 ans qui voyagent en mineurs Non Accompagnés avec Air France, Converse envoie un responsable à l’aéroport pour récupérer le jeune à l’arrivée. Pour les autres un taxi les attend. Tout est prévu !</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I love to stroll this shop.  It is my favorite.  Have bought so many treasures here & I love talking with the staff who are happy to answer my many questions.  If I go to Idyllwild, it's for lunch & this shop, alone, most times.</Review>

Overall they take great care of myself and my elderly parents and my disabled brother. If there's an issue the management is very responsive. If we have a need they try really hard to see us and help. The staff and MAs and nurse practitioners are wonderful. We have been there about 4 years and feel comfortable and safe there. Highly recommend.< /Text>

Very kind and helpful. They answered my questions and concerns with a lot of thoughtfulness put into their answers. I don’t have insurance so they make sure to get me help with the sliding fee scale whenever I go in.</Review>

These people are great!  Smiling, professional faces from the moment you walk in the door.  The Doctors and FNP's AND the Dentists are friendly, caring, professionals.  When you have visited them you know you are getting the best care possible.

Plus, they have a BRAND NEW facility with all the latest equipment of modern health care.

The fact that they provide BOTH Medical care AND Dental care at the same location is really great.

Another GREAT thing about them is that they work on a sliding scale for lower income Seniors and other financially distressed persons and families.  No need to fear unreasonable Medical bills here.  Where else can you get a cavity filled for $50?  Awesome for a disabled Senior!

I moved from a Family Practice down the street that is failing.  I had to wait a while to get on the patient roll, but well worth the wait!

Also, my FNP, Dana Underwood, is one of the best I have encountered.  She is caring, informed, thorough and puts your needs above all else.  No repeated watching the clock to see how soon they can move on to the next patient here!  If there are issues that take a bit more time, you get the attention.  If it is just a check-up, that's good too...

So, in conclusion, THANKS YOU ALL FOR YOUR KIND AND AWESOME HEALTH CARE!</review>

Always efficient, great care with what seems like the latest and best technology and equipment for care. They remind me of how Kaiser operates but better. Urgent care it’s usually quick and I’ve never had to wait long.<//review>

I have been a patient at the one in Redding for several years, but my Dr is at this location now, so I followed. I LOVE it! Its spacious and clean plus every person I interacted with was so pleasant. From the person taking temperatures to checking out. I couldn't be happier with my experience. I am so happy that this is where ill be going now! Kudos to the entire staff. Did I mention how clean it is!!!</Review>< user_name>

The new building in Anderson is really nice.  The staff here, both medical and dental, are the best.  They are friendly and helpful. Dana is a great asset to the medical provider team, a true professional while remaining friendly and caring. All in all this is such an improvement over the SCHC of old.<//review>

Saw np Shook yesterday at Anderson medical clinic and some months ago. Both times she was short to the point of rudeness and made me feel like I was wasting her time. I will never go back because of her. I am a 64 year old veteran and was treated with a complete lack of compassion and respect by this person. I never leave reviews so that's how negatively she affected me.had to give a star to post but I really I give her zero stars< /text>

I was impressed with the professionalism of all the employees.  The front office staff was polite, courteous and efficient.  The doctor was thorough and didn't rush me. She asked a lot of questions about my medical history and...she actually listened. I'm not the kind of person who goes to the doctor often but it's nice to know that if I ever need a doctor I have one that I trust and respect. Thank you for a great experience.

I have always been nervous about going to the doctors even to the point where I would cancel appointments and not go. These people here have made me feel very comfortable. They are so sweet. The ladies are absolutely wonderful.< /Review>

Drs are not caring or understanding. They just want you out ASAP. Won’t even address other health problems. Can’t wait to leave this place and find an actual doctor that cares! Gave it 2 stars, because some of the staff are great!</Text>

There is always room for improvement. It would be nice in any doctor's office to be listened to, respected, and not have sneers and judgement because of a particular medication.  I think if doctors and nurses would quit trying to prove how much they know, and listen to show how much they care the suicide rate in medicine might go down.< /text>

My first contact was with Fahm on the phone.  She was very polite,
patient, kind and professional.  She took the time to answer all my
questions.  I really appreciated my contact with her.  My husband
and I just moved here from another state and were having problems
finding a doctor.  We went into your clinic the day after talking to
Fahm and were greeted by Jamie, who in turn was very kind, considerate
and professional.  We highly recommend your clinic.</Review>

<Text>I love my Primary Care Provider. Dr. Helen Williams, FNP is caring, warm, professional, and efficient. I couldn’t ask for a better provider. The Patient Portal is woefully inadequate for up-to-date records... what’s the point? I had a long wait for my appointment.

<Review>I've been sitting in the waiting room for 40 minutes because I came in for a nursing appointment. They couldn't see me yesterday and knew I was coming in this morning. They told me the nurse isn't in yet and they don't know when she will be... really? You don't have her phone number? Your only going to make money off me so I don't see why you wouldn't bother calling her.</Review>< name>

I saw Dr. Featherstone for first time yesterday to work on my moderate chronic pain in left shoulder of 16 years. He did acupuncture & I have had some good results.  Look forward to visit in 2 weeks!  He also is encouraging me to try the spinal cord stimulator again.  I am excited & very grateful for Dr. Featherstone coming to Shasta Community Health Center!   We are blessed.
My advice to anyone with chronic pain is to NEVER give up!<//text>

<text>I love dr. Featherstone. In the 10 years I've been coming there he's the best Dr I've had. There were a few here and there that we're good to but they were also some that made me feel like they were just there to get a paycheck. I'm very very happy with dr. Featherstone.
I now have a new doctor and her name is Dr. HSU. I’ve only visited her one time and so far everything was taken care of that I needed. For me it’s a little early to review her, but so far I’m happy.< /text>< pictures>

<text>Julie Schock and her MA Kathy are extremely good to me. All PSR's are friendly when I call in and willing to go the extra mile to listen and help me. I just hope my Provider, Julie Schock,  doesn't just disappear on me like others. That's the one thing that scares me.  Once you've established a relationship with your health care team,  they seem to move on and you wind up starting all over again with someone new. That's hard 😢 for someone like me......Well it's happened. Julie and Kathy have moved on and I am going to start over with a new doctor. This is a scary time for me because I fall into a group of individuals who are judged harshly. I have chronic pain. I am not a drug seeker nor an addict in the worse sense of the word. I am a disabled older lady who was beaten for several years by a monster. I have been innandained with meds over the years and unnecessary surgeries. I have managed to get myself to a point of quality life. I did this myself. I take pain medications in order manage my pain in order for me to be a functioning human being. I still have a pain level of 4-5 but I can live with that. I am not a pill popping junkie. I'm just someone who hurts. Please don't judge me. I will be seeing Dr. Gasman in Redding SCHC. Wish me luck.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!   Don't bother taking your child there if they haven't been seen in sometime!  Step Parents are also not recognized as parents even with Mother's consent.  They care not if your child has their shots for school!!  ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!<//Text>

Best place for authentic Italian desserts. Their place has a sign that says something along the lines of “you love us, you just don’t know it yet” and honestly that’s so true. Their cannoli is on point and even though we entered as they were closing they still served us, and even gave us free dessert. They made the cannoli fresh since they ran out. I am very pleased!</Review>

Day out doing errands - hubby and I were both hungry .We decided to try Hungry Lu's. As I walked up to order a meatball sandwich - which was outstanding - I could not help but notice their assortment of Italian cookies! Not a chance I was going to leave without a sampling. So glad we did - they were 'DELISH'.

Since that initial visit I have ordered assortments of their cookies to serve to guests and everyone raves about how yummy they are!

This initial visit was in August and I am delinquent in this 5 star review but better late than never. I highly recommend both their sandwiches and COOKIES!<//review>

Decent Italian sandwiches, though nowhere close to what you'd find in Brooklyn.  The bread was the best part.  Their sweet selections looked great.< /Text>

I went here yesterday after just moving back to CA from Boston. If I'm in OB, I WILL be going to Lu's no matter what. They also have a bomb dessert selection, great drinks, indoor and outdoor seating, and the staff is as friendly as your best friend, and they mean it. If I could rate 6 stars, you can bet Lu's would get it. This place basically changed my view on the lack of east coast sub-style food in San Diego. I'm really relieved to know this place exists. So ya, it's that kinda seriously good.</text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>Outstanding! As a native NYer living in Arizona, I miss good Italian deli and pastries. We went in on a whim while visiting a business on the block and were not disappointed. The cannoli and macaroon were the best I ever had. We returned on the way out of town for Italian subs and more pastries for the road. The bread was fresh baked, fresh deli meat, and delicious. This will be a return spot on future vacations.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>I came here purposely to try out the Amaretti cookies. My sister LOVES these type of cookies and there were reviews on Yelp that they make them here. I came here and  bought 5 of them ($1 a piece - a bit pricey for the size of the cookie) and 2 wedding cookies. They did have sandwiches too that looked appealing but I did not get any at this time. The wedding cookies were a bit dry and tasted a little bit burnt. However, the outside sugar powder was delicious. (Almond flavor)  The Amaretti cookies were AMAZING. They were chewy and had a super delicious flavor. If you are expecting the cookies to be harder (like the small imported Italian ones), they are not so hard. They are a little bit hard around the outside, but oh so chewy and sweet and flavorful inside. I will definitely be marking this spot as my favorite place to get these cookies in SD.</text>< Response>

<date>1555183384556<//date><Review>Great little Italian sub shop a few blocks from the dog beach. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They bake their own bread and other baked goodies and it smells incredible in this shop.

We had an Italian sub and a roast beef, toasted. They were big and super tasty. We both had a snack for after the beach. We sat outside and the sandwiches were out to us.

We will definitely return for cookies and cannolis... I ate enough gluteb in that sub but the baked goods looked and smelled AMAZING!<//Review><rating>5<//rating>< user_name>

Categorically worth every one of its five stars. Run by someone who clearly loves their business we were warmly welcomed and served some delicious cookies and baked goods. A sweet interior, great music, nicely laid out. This was a post dinner sugar fix but we'll be back to try their savoury stuff in the future. The raspberry filled chocolate drizzled cookie sandwich was as good as it sounds.<//Review>

I live in OB, and this is one of my favorite go-to spots for a good sub - hot or cold.  They are always accommodating with special orders, and have fantastic homemade Italian cookies, friendly service, and are appropriately priced.  Seriously, do yourself a favor and get a cookie or fresh homemade cannoli every time you go in.

***** Service
***** Taste-to-Value Ratio
***** Consistent</Review>

Hungry Lu's is very good yet the subs are not as good as Grab & Go Subs and Sandwiches. Albeit, Hungry Lu's has an extensive offering of freshly made Italian pastrys.< /text>

I was super excited about this place. Spent 40 bucks on 6 cannoli's and a nice size box of mixed cookies. Cookies were buttery and light but the cannoli cream was a huge disappointment, filling was less than slightly sweet but over powering with lemon. I've been eating cannoli's since birth and vanilla has always been the main flavor with maybe a hint of cinnamon. Shells were nice tho.</text>

Easily the Best cannoli in town! These guys not only make their own cannoli shells but the ricotta cream filling is this ultra tasty, whipped to perfection cream that you just can't stop eating. All the other sweet treats are no less impressive. Many types of cookies and all of them fresh and uncompromisingly delicious. Definitely try the macaroons and the chocolate dipped cookies.
On the sandwich side they make spectacular subs, mostly with traditional Italian ingredients, some of them toasted. I just had the eggplants and mozzarella sammy and it's an instant favorite.
There is some outside seating, so you can enjoy your lunch/dessert without delay.
A great contribution to the neighborhood.</text>

Freddie is kind, professional,  and always accommodates me at the last minute. He is incredibly hardworking.   My hair always looks great.

You can also tell that Freddie really cares about his employees and his customers.</Text>

My son got a haircut here and he seemed happy with the service. He looked sharp after his appointment.
Numerous stylist in the shop, hair products for sale. Located on 7th Ave Between C street & B street.
Very close to numerous food options in the same block.</text>

New in town, and needed a haircut urgently. Freddy was just the expert I was looking for, he took the time to listen and walk me thru few options, and his technique is impeccable. Loved the whole process, very professional, love the result, and I am getting lots of compliments! Thank you Freddy and Sheila!< /Review>

<Text>Freddy saved my (hair's) life when I received an awful short (women's) cut in my hometown and was traveling through San Diego. He accommodated me last minute too for which I'm super grateful. Definitely recommend this salon and Freddy for sure- I've received more compliments on this haircut than any I can remember. Thank you!!</Text>< date>

<review>Love it here! Always very clean and the service is amazing.  This is the only place that cuts my hair the way that I explain. The owner Freddy recommended the massage therapist and I'm so glad he did! I left the salon feeling great after my great new haircut and relaxing massage.  A+ Service all the way!< /review>< Response>

I been coming here for about 3 years now and there is only one person I trust with my hair, his name is Freddy. You can tell he is really talented.  Where else can you go and get a full salon treatment for half the cost! You can tell that the employees truly cares about it's customers.
There is times I see walk-ins that come in and they make it seem like that person has been coming to the salon for years.

I'm not planning on going nowhere and neither are they.< /Text>

I've been to the salon twice so fast and have had both Stephanie and Freddy dye and cut my hair. The salon has a fantastic urban feel and they really go above and beyond making their clients feel welcomed and pampered. These stylists are true artists and I always look forward to my next visit at Groom!< /Review>

Groom has a fun and modern vibe.  Freddy and his staff are amazing.  Friendly, professional, and most importantly awesome with hair.  From traditional men's cuts like mine to more modern stylish cuts for my fiance, they are the best.  I definitely recommend checking them out.</Text>

<text>I have been going to Groom for year and this place is awesome. The entire staff is friendly and welcoming. The décor is unique, really cool vibe. There are TVs, usually with sports or the news on. Music is playing, but at a nice volume.

Freddy usually cuts my hair and is the best, but I would recommend everyone at Groom.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80d954a708b197b7:0xcf180f676dad7f2a<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

When I walked out of the salon I looked exactly the same as when I walked into the salon. The appointment started 20 minutes later than what I booked. He left me sitting in the chair with a "10 min." deep conditioner on my hair for 30 mins, while he helped a regular client, who walked-in, buzz his hair off. He pretended to cut a small amount of hair from the length, not that you can tell, NOBODY CAN.  He was done in less than 5 minutes.  I have thick hair, there is no way anyone can cut my hair in 5 minutes.  Don't wasted your time and money. Freddy is a JOKE!  I'm asking for my money back.< /Text>

If you're looking for professional with style who will know how to style YOUR hair, this is the place to go.  Freddy and his team are hair artists, well versed in color, cuts and how you make you look your personal best.  Groom the Salon offers great prices and more than that, they offer great service.  Making an appointment is as easy as quick phone call, and if you don't have time to call, walk ins are welcome.  Part of the heart beat of San Diego, Groom The Salon not only takes your hair style wishes into consideration, they take the community as a whole into consideration and host many events that give back to San Diego's youth.  Freddy is a great stylist whose charm and knowledge of hair will keep you coming back as a repeat client.  Not to mention the amazing massage you receive when getting your shampoo (that alone will make you a client).  I walked in with drab, long, frizzy hair and walked out with shiny, brilliant smooth locks that made me feel like  million bucks.  Thank you Freddy and Groom the Salon, you made my day.<//Review>

<review>I was hesitant to write a review, because I didn't want everyone taking up my time with Freddy, but my mom told me that good things are even better when shared. So here goes. My hubby and I have been going to Freddy for more than 5 years now and couldn't be happier. I've had all types of cuts, long layers, pixie, asymmetrical bob, bangs, etc. I always walk out happy, with the slightly edgy (but still ok for corporate life) cuts he gives me.</review>< user_name>

<Text>Groom is the kind of salon you want to go to for a cut.  I've been coming to Groom for 2 years now and I'm glad I started. Freddy is an awesome stylist who gives me the cut I want everytime.

Great staff, from reception to stylists. Awesome cuts, too - both modern and edgy to tried & true classics.<//Review>

Freddy always hooks it up with great cuts for both my husband and myself. As a woman with short hair, it's hard to get the right mix of good cut while staying distinctly feminine, and he does an awesome job at it, especially since I normally don't have any particular idea in mind (somehow he just knows what I want before I do :-)). Admittedly, he's the only one I've seen but I am sure I'd be in just as good hands with any of the other highly professional and friendly staff there. The salon itself is always very clean and very professional and I always feel very comfortable there -- and I know I will always walk out of there beaming 'cause I got an awesome haircut for a VERY reasonable price, including any re-ups on any number of styling products that either of us use.

Tip: It's located Downtown, so be sure to factor in time to find parking OR, better yet, go green and use the MTS Orange Line which will take you right down the block from the location.< /Text>

<review>Worst haircut ( if you can call it that) ive ever gotten. I had to wait 30 min past my appointment time and then he he spent a whole 10 min cutting my hair. There wasn't even enough hair to fill a dust pan half way.

<review>Let me just start by saying I am VERY PICKY about who does my hair.  I have switched stylists many times over the last few years.  I've been to a few in downtown SD, some in  Fancy Schmancy- La Jolla, and all over North County and paid way too much for my highlights, I've tried numerous AVEDA salons, and then continued on my quest to find a great colorist, but I have finally ended my search after I met Freddy.

He's great!  He's funny, entertaining and quickly builds great rapport with his customers and treats you like one of his best friends the moment you sit down in his chair.

I have uber long, thick hair and he masterfully highlights away until *POOF* a few hours later my dry, lifeless locks are back to looking beautiful and shiny.  The best part is his amazing massages while he's washing away the bleach/dye...  You'll fall in love!

The Salon is very cute and trendy too, it's in downtown SD and plays great music.  They also serve fun drinks and keep you entertained while you wait.

Definitely worth a visit, but make sure you request FREDDY! :)</review>< user_name>

Small but lovely, quasi-deli café with great charcuterie paninis and coffee drinks. A large selection of awesome sandwiches that use few ingredients but are sophisticated combos. Nice outdoor seating area if you're lucky enough to get a spot.< /review>

<review>Authentic Italian lunch spot and cafe that I frequent for some fresh salads. I particularly like the chicken and avocado which is a light lunch but you can tell everything is really fresh. The cherry tomatoes just pop in your mouth and the avocado is always smooth and creamy, with no brown spots like some other restaurants. I always order through grub hub and the cashiers are really friendly. You can just pick up right at the cash register, and you pay before receiving your food. I often see people sitting in the outdoor tables just people-watching. They have a variety of coffees and also matcha lattes. They have some items available to go as well, so it would be good to pick up some items if you’re ever trying to do a picnic of some sort. Overall it’s a cute spot and a hidden gem in Beverly Hills for some light Italian food.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0cDzDzn65aOXRhFlGEVbC08qC2h6QyWA6pXKu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>Had a quick café latte before heading to an appointment I had there in the area.

Friendly service. The young man behind the counter is from Italy so you can practice your Italian with him if you want.

They offer little bite size appetizers for you to munch on while enjoying your coffee at no additional charge. That was what drew me in to begin with; at first glance I thought it might be a Basque style pincho place.

Their menu looks interesting too. Next time I drop in I will have their prosciutto panino. With a latte on the side, of course. Those two things go well together.<//text>< pictures>

Best coffee in Beverly Hills, and a great deli to top it off. Various Italian items for sale, like meats, cheeses, oils, pastas, and more.

Perfect for lunch. I recommend their salads. Literally any salad on their menu. I've never had a bad one there. (Their lemon dressing is perfection)<//Text>

Just a heads up - I got my phone STOLEN from this restaurant. It was in my purse on a chair next to me and someone took it while I wasn't looking. After calling it, they had turned it off so I couldn't use "Find My Phone," plus I never turn my phone off. Clearly a pro thief.<//text>

Olivier and the team were great. I had a diagnostic done at the dealership for my check engine light while my car was in for an unrelated recall. Dealership prices are astronomical, so I called Pacific Auto, who quoted me less than half the cost for the same repairs. They got me in the next day and even redid the diagnostic to double check before they started repairs. Turns out, the dealership was wrong and my radiator wasn't leaking, the hose connection was just loose. They did the other repairs necessary and retightened the hose fitting. All in all, they saved me $1400+ compared to the dealership and had my car back to me the next day.  They're honest with what needs to be done, quick, and very affordable. I wouldn't hesitate to bring my car back for future repairs.</Text>

They definitely know what they're doing. I wouldn't say they're cheap, but neither is their work. They put great quality and care into what they do. If you want some professional work done without having to worry about your car after, go here. They're great people< /review>

<Text>I have lived in San Diego for about 15 years and for the first five years I had bad car experiences. I think as a female it’s easy to feel intimidated by car stuff and get taken advantage of. That was until I found Pacific Auto. I’ve been bringing my car there for the last 10 years they always provide me with an estimate before starting work they never overcharge me or recommend things not needed for my car. This is the only place I’ll bring my car it’s the only place I recommend. The team are fair and really know what they’re doing.< /Text>< time>

Great service and customer experience! I was heavily quoted by a Toyota dealler for some suspension work for my 2013 Scion tC, so I decided to see what my local car mechanics can do about it. Out of 5 different requests only Pacific Auto reached back and gave me a MUCH more reasonable quote (kudos to Fernando!). Now Pacific Auto has an extra customer to use their services in the future :) Thanks guys!< /Review>

After a horrible dealership experience, for a reasonable cost, pacific auto figured out the problem, documented it, and even included dealer bulletins on a related recall.  They could have told us it wasn't going to be covered, and it was a very expensive repair, but instead counseled us on how to deal w dealership.   With the info pacific auto provided, a different dealer gave us a rental car and got fix done.<//text>

It was time for an oil change and I had received an AAA offer for a 40-point inspection. The work was done very thoroughly, with a detailed summary at the end. As usual, Olivier and his team of mechanics did a great job and I was charged only for the oil change. I really trust Pacific Auto Service, as they are serious, efficient and honest. No bad surprises with them ! I highly recommend this place.<//Text>

Fernando checked us in and out promptly and was very friendly and professional. Olivier called us and informed us of the status of our car and what they found. Both were very courteous, kind and knowledgeable! We’ve definitely found a great place to take our cars to!</Text>

I came across Pacific Auto because they service the fleet of vehicles for the company I work for.  I’ve always been impressed with their ability to accommodate me on short notice for oil changes and routine check ups.  Very impressed with the service they do on our fleet so i Recently had them Do an inspection on a used truck i purchased.  They delivered a very detailed assessment of the vehicle with honesty and integrity.  They put in the extra time and effort to dial in the vehicle to run like new without trying to sell me on things i didn’t need.  It felt like having family take care of the vehicle.  If you value honesty , expertise and integrity Then choose pacific auto ... they won’t tell you what you want to hear but they will tell you what you need to know so you can make a calculated decision !</Text>

Great service, I'm new to San Diego and not knowing anyone it was nice that Fernando called me by my first name reminded me of home. My air conditioning was not blowing cold and they took care of it while I was at work at a good cost. Air conditioning blowing nice and cold now. Thank you Fernando and your team!</review>

<Text>Usually great service and front counter help on info for work scope needed and work completed is top rated. Lots of loyalty from individual customers and fleet maintenance service for all type of vehicles. However never take great service for granted if you rely on you vehicles. Pacific auto completes jobs for a fair price for difficult repairs plus where else can you get tea, coffee, and my favorite almond cookie. Great business with a totally international service and management crews. Thanks for the service and sweet support</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I continue to get impressed by the great service provided by Pacific Auto Service. Olivier and his whole staff are great, honest and reliable. Oliver went out of the way to help me find the used replacement part and provided great professional advice. The service they provided was of good quality and they did a perfect job and also the charges for their work was reasonable.

For servicing and repair work on all my cars, I will go nowhere else. Best auto shop in town :)</Review>< username>

Summary: ONLY GO TO THIS PLACE IF YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME.

I had an appointment at Pacific Auto Service at 2pm on a Thursday. I arrived at 1:40pm, and they told me they needed to run a diagnostic before they could find out what was wrong with my car's air conditioner. At around 3:20pm, over an hour and a half after arriving, during which I waited patiently in the lobby, they told me that they didn't have the tool to run the diagnostic for my year and model of car! I told them the year, make, and model when I scheduled the appointment, as well as confirmed it when I arrived! I wasted a total of 2 hours at the place, for them to tell me they did absolutely nothing with my car! Only go to this place if you want your time wasted, what a joke!< /review>

Impressed with this place! I'm a former service advisor and rarely trust a shop with my vehicles.. This place is an exception. Diagnosis was performed immediately and accurately. Will be returning.<//Review>

This place is awesome! I was driving from Irvine to San Diego for a meeting when a warning light came on. AAA referred me to this place and I took the car there before my meeting. They looked at my car right away, turns out there's a sensor that has gone bad. The didn't even charge me! I was in and out within 30 minutes.< /Review>

We've never experienced any problems or surprises when having work done to our cars, ranging from BMWs, Hondas and a Toyota. Thanks to Olivier, Fernando and the rest of the team our cars are always taken care of.

Clean facility, both the waiting room and work areas. Free WiFi and coffee if you decide to wait!</Review>< Pictures>

This shop has been my "go to" shop for several years. The employees are nice and will explain, as well as show, what is wrong with the car and what needs to be done to bring it back to perfect working order. They take the time to make sure that everything is done right the first time. Their prices are very reasonable for the quality of work that they do. Check them out next time you need any car work done, you won't be disappointed.<//Text>

I was worried my car might be done. Pacific Auto Service diagnosed the problem, found the right replacement part, sent an employee to go pick it up, installed it, and sent me on my way. The thing I appreciate the most is that they were up front about their pricing, didn't make any promises they couldn't keep, and explained the problem they found while also showing me the damaged part. As a single woman, I always do research before going into an auto shop; Pacific Auto Service has made me feel comfortable and never gone against the knowledge I've acquired from friends and family</text>

< review>
My car engine started to tremble a week ago and cannot accelerate.  Visited Pacific on a Saturday morning and mechanics there helped to diagnose the problem, which is associated with ignition misfire of one cylinder.  It was fixed in a couple of hours and now running again. Service fee is quite reasonable especially with the AAA discount. What's most impressive about this experience is that it is very easy - almost streamlined. AAA recommended Pacific, I called them, AAA towed the car in, and Pacific had it fixed. People there are professional and helpful; spacious and clean office environment as well. It does not feel like a car repair place but a clinic. I would go back again and highly recommend it to everyone.< /review>

I have used Pacific Auto Services for years now and completely love it! Will, Olivier, and Fernando are always incredibly cordial, the place is ultra-clean, and I can always count on a no-BS, completely honest and reliable service. My family, friends and I have been going there for many years and can't recommend the place enough. Simply: the best car shop I've ever been to.< /review>

"Shawn" the Iranian guy is a full on scammer. My battery was dead and said there was no way he could jump it. He said I HAD to buy his $125 battery with six year warranty. What a liar. I made him jump it and the car ran fine. He said the battery would fail at home too. NOT TRUE. It's fine here.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1536360569693, 'text': 'Sorry wrong company!

The owners are also the lead technicians -- very knowledgable about their profession, and also run a pleasant business (been around for 20 years). The waiting area is quite comfortable, well-separated from the garage/shop, with choices of recliners, chair w/ table, sofa -- plus some light beverages available. There's also a nice deli across the street. I had some diagnostics run on my car; findings were reasonable based on age and use, was prescribed a proper maintenance plan. Thanks again, always good to come to Pacific Auto Service.<//Text>

Excellent service.  We travel 2 hours to bring our vehicle to be serviced here.  Great communication and service from the time we call to make the appointment to the time when our car is ready for pick up. We are informed of the diagnostics and estimated cost. We would highly recommend others here.< /Text>

Mechanics have a reputation of being dishonest and deceiving. This couldn't be further from the truth when it comes to Pacific Auto Service. I've never encountered a more honest upfront respectful group of people from the Owner Olivier (French pronunciation) to Fernando and the rest of the crew and especially the beautiful Chloe the Duberman.  Thank you for your great work and honesty, you restored my faith in humanity.< /text>

Timely, professional, pleasant and effective.

They fixed my wife's car's stubborn oil leak that two visits to our previous automotive mechanic weren't able to fix -- and for a cheaper price as well.

<Review>Cloverleaf is the go to market around Goldfinch and Reynard. The merchandise is always high quality and things are usually in stock and in place. It is similar to an AM/PM but has more goods and different things to choose from, in comparison. The only problem is that some of the prices tend to be a little bit on the high end, but the workers are helpful and always seem to be in a good mood.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

The afternoon employee is extremely rude and always on his phone.  Yelling at customers in the store for no good reason.  Simple questions are too much for him.

Won't come back until he is gone!<//text>

<resp>None< /resp><text>Quality Neighborhood Market on Reynard Way between Little Italy and Mission Hills.. Employees are laid back with a friendly the Customer is number one attitudes.. Major plus due to the gas pumps here although a gallon is  somewhat pricey..  Place is quite overpriced maybe even a little more than overpriced disgusting 7 Eleven which cost them a Star on their rating.. Overall, this is a Great Store..<//text>< name>

<text>We have been staying here since last few months. A great experience so far. Feels safe and peaceful. Overall a beautiful view and great maintainence.
Just one suggestion : Balconies should not have a gap in the wooden floor because dirt and other things fall from upstairs apartment on the ground floor patio, especially when you are eating.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFD1TqayCh0E-YaUaTenh9UsZHyZSjWpp_Oks4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLw2L61ddOZ0zuuFbr4UpGiodMj_SX1i0tF3A-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHBsrZ-v7hMB2MSQPDEcxPuo1nlPX8s47qUUfb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPb0R5qFPrKMwJezFgBfk_G4sRcw3bU7UQz1dRu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2LzY3ozzNRAhn6PWpuCoHnzqX6VZe4UWxZ7e2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7UwMMu0ojhrKP4iPcjh0GOqHwl8lkx6U2x6FQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXhc7gbpHagD5dz4fTN9ZSrmpDwDELAVIpxwm5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEgk1y6xcdWL8g9bhr_wezkTk4N15b6bYpifL7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><rate>4<//rate>< user_name>

I have not received any notification until its 2-3 hours prior to the outage. Starting from yesterday, the apartment has no hot water. It has been over 24 hours now and I still haven't received an ETA on the fix. No one picks up the phone when you call the leasing office, despite they said they will call you back shortly.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>It's the biggest trap to rent this place. We have never seen some thing like this in the other major cities in the USA.  This is a great community and everything is going on great. I would say we loved staying here with the management. We are 3 software professionals who spend most our time at the office and barely cook at home. [Edit: they would ask us personally contact them but that will not work out as I was already dealing with them for past 2 months, you would get only reply a week, Great Management strategies ]

1) Avoid this community if are planning not to stay more than 10 Years yes absolutely 10 Years, because that's when they consider replacing the carpet. We stayed here for one year and the carpet was in great shape and on the last day after we moved out we even had the professionals do the complete cleaning for the carpet and other stuff. Guess what they charged us the carpet cleaning fee of 70$ which is horrible. In Fact, management didn't even touch the carpet after we moved out. But we still have the fee on our bill. We asked what have you cleaned and provided the bills that you have done the cleaning. No bills are provided except the one in the images

2)Suree, is the Manager who helped me here. She is a very nice person in fact. No troubles during the renting term or sign up for the lease. Real colors come to life when you have moved out. Yup, that's true, they will blame you for all the cleaning fees they don't even do. The people who do the service in the apartment once you move out generates a report of what services they have performed and they take the pictures of the dirty place and the places that require cleaning or painting. "Yes, we got charged for cleaning "$180" and painting 140.88". The apartment is very clean at the time of move out and we even have photos to show how clean it is. Even the report shows 2 spots of uncleaned places, one inside the lower side of the oven and the Electric stove burners which are given to us in a very bad shape, we even have mentioned it in our move-in checklist. We asked why did we get charged that much amount? there are no answers for a couple of days and suddenly they started giving out random answers not related to question. When I have instead them to let me know the reason they mentioned about the smell in the apartment. This is the time when we notice there is something else going on with the management people and they are trying to cover their tracks very carefully. After carefully studying the report given by the servicemen it's clear that they haven't performed anything related to painting or smell. I just felt I was getting robbed here by the Management.

3)  They cant provide proofs no bills on who or which company has done the work. All these are pretty self-explanatory that these are amounts that charge every renter who lives there for lower than 10 years. I would avoid this place at all costs. It's not worth it to waste time with this management.

4) the provided emails show how reckless they are when responding or answering questions. The provided pictures are taken from the management provided the report and yes they cant proven even single cleaning they have done.

5) still no response from management, because they really don't care

6)Made us to pay it by theretining it to get it credit report.<//Review><Date>1618523173764</Date><resp>None< /resp>< rating>

<Text>The positives:
The maintenance crew is top notch (Igor and Alex are 5 star employees). Any requests are taken care of promptly. In addition, the community is safe, overall pretty quiet, lots of parking, packages are delivered straight to your door, and a 10-15 minute walk to the Caltrain station and downtown Sunnyvale. The apartment units themselves look nice considering the buildings are older and have lots of storage and/or closet space. Before Covid-19, the pool area was beautiful and relaxing, there were grills to use, and the fitness room had great basic equipment.

The negatives:
The units themselves could use a lot of upgrades. My fridge and AC both stopped working and had to be replaced - it would be nice if they could invest in energy efficient appliances. The units aren't sound proof; luckily my neighbors have been quiet individuals, but even a normal volume conversation can sound like an echo from above or below you. New renters should avoid any units facing the train tracks (Buildings 100 and 120) otherwise you will be in for a surprise when one particular freight train rolls through each night between 9pm-midnight and shakes your whole building. They had people come do balcony "repair" work across all units, but the repairs looked no different than what it looked previously.

The ultra negative:
Obviously, the pandemic has resulted in the pool area only being for swimming (no lounge chairs), the grills closed off, and the fitness room closed. While unfortunate, this is understandable, but only up until a new lease rolls around and Equity Residential gives a lease "offer" renewal of the same as what we signed pre Covid-19. What...? Do they want us to say we are grateful for not raising our rate 10% like they normally do? The process of trying to negotiate down is like pulling teeth, and Equity Residential will take over a week to respond to emails, and will provide another "offer" that is still way above market rate (and way above what they are asking on the SAME OR LARGER available units at Briarwood) and say the "offer" is only valid for 24 hours. What? (I'm looking at you, Amber Pardue on the Corporate Renewals team, and whoever your 'negations' boss is). The worst part is that I've been at Briarwood since June 2018 and have lived in 3 different units within 2.5 years. This is because larger units will be available and less expensive than the renewal "offers", yet Equity Residential would rather have me transfer to a unit down the sidewalk every year than allow me to continue living at my current (now former) unit for a reasonable market rate price. If it sounds like it doesn't make sense, that's because it doesn't. Oh, and my counteroffer that Equity Residential rejected? My old apartment is listed as available on their website for a monthly rate $150 LOWER than my counteroffer (and listed over $700 less per month than their renewal offer to me). Please, remind me how I'm a "valued resident"?? Because I don't feel like one.< /Text>< rate>

I really couldn't think of any positive reason to stay this terrible apartment.
staffs here are pretty unfriendly, facility is pretty old.
I think that's also the reason why more and more residents decide to leave this terrible place.

I know this review may incur they "template response" to connect to your and get your feedback. But believe me, they never listen. The staffs here are super unprofessional.</text>

A great place to call "home". Lots of greenery around - very peaceful place. The place is well maintained, clean and the office staff - specially Suree is very helpful and friendly.
The workout rooms are open 24//7 are rarely crowded and the pool area is lovely - perfect place to chill. It has exactly what I want and that is whatever I need, in walking distance - Sunnyvale downtown, cal-train station etc.</Text>

I have lived here at Briarwood since 2006. I love it here! The management staff have always been extremely friendly, helpful and nice. They are always willing to talk with me and help me with any issues. Maintenance couldn't be any better. They are quick to respond to any issues and make any needed repairs in a timely manor. They have gone above and beyond my expectations for an apartment complex.  I highly recommend Briarwood Apartments.</Text>

<Text>Great place to live. Nothing fancy, but the units are functional and durable. The noise from the train tracks isn't bad at all. Neighbors are quiet and keep to themselves. The staff has been great and is responsive to any questions. Location is awesome as it's just a short drive away from downtown Sunnyvale, El Camino shopping centers, downtown Mountain View, etc...

If you are expecting a luxury apartment this is not the right place, but if you just need something functional and convenient I highly recommend this place.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>This is a "hidden treasure!"  I've lived at Briarwood for almost three years and it's the best apartment I've ever lived in!  My experience has been nothing but positive!!!  The location is perfect, the apartments are really quiet, the parking is exceptional and the staff is superior.  I enjoy interacting with the office staff, Suree and Alyssa.  They are both very nice, friendly, accommodating and responsive.  The maintenance staff is also exceptional!  They are so nice and always go out of there way to go above and beyond.  I've broken my closet rods a few times and they have always gone out of their way to be nice to accommodate me and fix anything that I break quickly, and they do it in such good spirit.  I really love it here!!!<//Review>< pics>

<review>Great community, super friendly Staff and one of the best maintenance teams this side of the Mighty Mississippi.

Super accessible part of town, walking distance to downtown Sunnyvale, short drive/bike ride from Downtown mountain view, footsteps from CalTrain! Dog friendly is an understatement, all kinds of dogs around the complex and the leasing office crew get to know them and remember them!

We've lived here almost 3 years and it's been our favorite apartment complex we've lived in (lived in 4 over the past 6 years).< /review>< pics>

So I generally do not write reviews but I really HAVE to this time. I have been a resident at the Briarwood Apartments, Sunnyvale for close to 5 years now.
Unfortunately, I have decided to move up north towards San Francisco for personal reasons. But, I need to let the world know, that this gem of an apartment complex (with a gem of a manager, more on her later) in the heart of Sunnyvale is an amazing place to live. If you work at WalmartLabs, then this should be your default apartment of choice. It is close to 101, and 280, you can walk to the Caltrain station, and to the historic murphy avenue (Sunnyvale downtown) with plenty of food and drink options. The location is central, yet the apartment complex is extremely peaceful. The residents are nice and courteous and the complex is clean. Plenty of large parking spaces and a new and amazing gym. Regular food trucks and a beautiful pool. I have loved every minute I have spent here. And now, the star of the review, Suree Marley. I don’t have words to describe this amazing person. She is extremely kind and is always ready to help. I kept running to her for something or the other, and she will always hear me out patiently and will always help me in the greatest possible manner. It is a shame that she will not be my property manager anymore, but Hey Equity, the only reason I picked my next equity apartment is because you have people like Suree. I will miss her a lot. One more person I need to talk about is Igor. What and honest and sincere man. Hats off to you Igor. Many years ago in 2014, he refused to accept a tip from me because he said it is his duty to help me. Briarwood apartment is an amazing place (with an amazing team) to call home and I would always cherish the time I have spent here.</review>

I lived at Briarwood Apartments from 1985-1988 when my parents and I moved...as you can tell, I have a good memory. I remember it was painted blue, it had two playgrounds and Cannery Park is right across the street. My dad would come home from work and he would take me to see the Libby Water Tower at sunset in the summer. I made friends there, my parents got along with the management and the best thing of all it was BRAND NEW! Sadly, we moved out in 1988 and I would never see the closet with mirrors again. I would most definitely live there again< /text>

Even though we liked the place, I will recommend to stay away from Briarwood. I lived there for 1 year and we were hit with a 12% rent increase. Equity Residential is a corporation that takes advantage of people</text>

Super quiet and safe community! I have a dog and and a 1 year old, it's got lots of green space for them to both run around. Also, Igor is a super star when it comes to maintenence! I have lived here for 3 years and I have no plans of moving!

It is close to Caltrain, which is great, but keep in mind, you can hear it in your apartment. If your not sensitive to noise, it's no problem at all! If it is an issue for you, you'll want an apartment on the far side of the community.</text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>So heres the thing. So far I love it here everyone is great except who ever was filling in for my favorite person, Alyssa. The day I showed up I had made a plan and gone through all the steps 2 weeks in advance I drove 20 hours and was given a hard time and made to stay in a hotel. If I had to deal with that person ever again I would run away. They were not helpful and treated me like a criminal. They even had the nerve to ask if I had proof of my agreement with Alyssa in writing.

Everyone else is amazing, if it wasnt for an exceptionally bad move in experience they would be getting a 5.

That person needs some serious customer service training.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Lived here for the last 2 years before moving out last month.
Initially the experience was pleasant - seemingly good location, relatively affordable rent, quiet neighbors, and Chantel in the leasing office was fantastic. However, once she left the complex in early 2015, everything went downhill. The staff never warned that Caltrain would be SO loud and would go by so fast that it produced mini earthquakes that shook all the walls of my apartment every day.
Eventually incredibly obnoxious neighbors moved in all around us - blasting music at all hours, dogs barking 24/7, and my favorite - constantly screaming infants! The grandparents would bring the infants out onto the balcony when they started crying/screaming so everyone and their mother in the complex could hear it, regardless of what time it was...kill me now! So inconsiderate! Had to call the cops more than once on a few neighbors.
When I first moved in, the maintenance staff told me that they were short one cabinet for my kitchen and promised to get it to me right away. Yet 2 years later, still no cabinet! Instead of continuing to ask repeatedly for the cabinet, my roommate put a print out of a "This is where I'd put a cabinet...IF I HAD ONE!" meme on the wall in its place.
On top of that, the seal of our refrigerator broke about 8 months ago. When my roommate went to the office to ask for a repair, explaining that we hadn't been able to buy milk for 6 months since it didn't stay cold in the refrigerator, a member of the leasing staff said…and I directly quote..."well, just drink it [the milk] faster..."! That was it! Not "oh so sorry, let us fix it for you"...just "drink it faster..." - SERIOUSLY?!   So we said, we see your rent increase and attitude, we're out of here! For the astronomical cost of rent they charge to keep up with the newer Silicon Valley complexes, you’d think they’d be more diligent about renovating/maintaining the place.
For all the gripes I might have with this complex and the people who live there, I will say that as we approached the tail end of our lease, Alyssa in the leasing office was a bright spot. She was always very helpful, pleasant, and professional. She even brought my packages from the leasing office to my front door when she got off work, which was pretty convenient seeing as how her apartment was just around the corner from my unit, and very much appreciated as I did not usually get home from work until well after the leasing office closed.< /Review>

<review>Absolutely terrible, if I could give negative stars I would. Our driver wasn’t wearing a mask, nor had a mask on him, we had to give him one. Not to mention, he was hacking up a lung the entire drive - we’re in the middle of a global pandemic, sir. Aside from that, he was falling asleep at the wheel and veering off the road. The drivers lack of regard for our safety was appalling. You’re better off using Uber, or walking.</review><GmapID>0x80851440005aec41:0x5e21a9d56ba1d814<//GmapID>< rating>

They had me waiting over an hour for me to keep calling back the the man on the phone kept telling me 20mins I don’t really care about the wait just let me know that I will be waiting that long so that way it gives me the option to continue to wait or find another alternative for transportation at that moment ... again the cabs are clean and the drivers are polite but the Male receptionists are unprofessional... thank you for your services..<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Horrible horrible experience. My friends and I were simply trying to have a nice night. Our driver was not only late picking us up, but was also a complete jerk. He shockingly thought it was ok to drive 80 mph down residential streets, text and drive, and go through numerous stop signs. By the way, mr. Taxi driver why was it $80 to go a total of 4 miles? I was fearful for my life, and thought I would never see my campus again. Next time, my friends and I will be using uber, or walking.<//Text>

< Review>
New to Fairfield, Can. & I have to say these cab drivers who drive for this Company is the most RUDEST divers I've encounter ever!!!! ( MORE THAN ONCE) Just because I say I'm NEW to Fairfield, doesn't mean I don't know the basic way on the streets, & the drivers feel to drive fast as hell, won't allow you to notice they're taking long routes for a higher fair... (SMH)
Then when you comment on it .... They want you out their cab & start talking rude to you!!! All I can say is UBER'S GOING MY WAY!!!!!! LBVS....<//Review>

<review>I did not call company for pick up my tenant did   when they came to pick her up and her things . Right in front car 108 employee started to urinate in front of my house. I caught him with pants down stopped him and asked him what is thinking . He got embarrassed and said sorry this was all in front of the person he picked up. My tenant was embarrassed by this whole thing especially when there's a public bathroom to use on site. I had called left many messages to have manager call me back and no calls back and when I called to leave my many calls the dispatcher just said that he's busy.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Was at the er last night at 2 in the morn and waited for a taxi home, driver turned off radio because i was close to walk home from the hospital at 345 am, waited over hr and a half to finally have another one pick me up.  Ya it might have been a short ride but i was in the hospital and im not walking alone at 3 something in the morn cause the driver wants to be a duschbag.</Review>

I don’t normally write reviews, but I do understand why Uber and lyft are taking over now. Waited over 45 minutes for a taxi, called and the lady said another 15 minutes. Worst service ever and this is not the first time this has happened to me with them.<//text>

<review>Called for a cab and was told it would be 20-25 minutes wait time. 30 minutes went by and I called back and the dispatcher informed me that she had never sent a driver for me but that she would "get one right over". 20 minutes later a cab finally arrived.< /review><gmapID>0x80851440005aec41:0x5e21a9d56ba1d814< /gmapID>< Name>

< review>
Sunday evening October 9 2016 I called for a cab at 7:56pm was told 25-30 minutes and when 8:36pm came around and still no cab I started calling the number in which there was no answer, finally at almost 10:30pm someone finally answered, and I asked why the cab never showed up and was told that I was on some do not pick up list, now for the life of me I still cannot figure out why even after asking, then she said did you skip out on paying, I said never would I do that and asked who could I talk to about it and she gave me the main office number and I waited until Monday morning and called a few times with no answer again I left 2 voicemails then remembered it was a holiday so I waited to call today Tuesday October 11 2016 only to once again get the voicemail. I am very mad at the poor customer service this company has and will be making a report to the BBB.....
One unsatisfied customer!!!!</review>

<Text>I rarely post comments, but this is the worst cab company ever.  I had booked a cab about one month ago and confirmed the pickup the day before to the airport.  Only about 1 hour before pickup, the company called me and said “We don’t pick up in Vacaville” and canceled my ride.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<text>Another hidden gem in Castro/Church neighborhood 🌈. There are tons of taqueria in the city. However, this one has a very homie feel to it and serves unpretentious homemade Mexican food. You've gotta to try their nachos with beef, it's delicious and the portion is huge! This place seems to be the locals' favorite. As of May 2021, both dine in and take out are available. If you're craving Mexican food in this neighborhood, you should give it a try!🌮🌈😋🥳<//text>< Pictures>

They use sliced cheese vs shredded. Fewer meat selections compared to other taquerias in San Francisco. Cash only or cards used with fees.

Dining room is closed. No outdoor dining. Only to go orders. Staff and customers wear masks. Hand sanitizer is offered. Markers on the floor for distancing.< /Text>< response>

This place is Okay. Just 2 problems. They only seem to have 'Grilled Chicken!' They don't have the Softer Boiled Chicken like other similar restaurants! Also; my Carne' Asada Burrito was Hella-dry! It had all the ingredients but very little sauce on the inside! The Service was Good but the Food was just Ok!< /Review>

<Review>I have lived all over SF and yesterday as I approached the realization hit that I eat here minimum twice monthly for over ten years. The tomato tortilla encasing my carne asada super burrito was a lil crunchy, warm and loaded. I did a silent gasp. It was my sublime. Thank you<//Review>< pictures>

Al pastor is flavorful but a bit soupy. Carne Asada not the most flavorful. Portions are large. Vibe is very authentic.< /review>

It's been 7 years since I've eaten a burrito here. It's still good. Possibley the best burrito I've had. It deffinitly something in seasoning. The chips have it too. Come check it out. I feel it stands out from the rest. Excellent price and portion size. Cash only though.<//Text>

It's been 7 years since I've eaten a burrito here. It's still good. Possibley the best burrito I've had. It deffinitly something in seasoning. The chips have it too. Come check it out. I feel it stands out from the rest. Excellent price and portion size. Cash only though.< /Review>

Great service, my boyfriend and I used to come in every Friday for the longest time! I love this place and I love the people. Hasta me encanta bromear con los cocineros cada vez que venimos. I just wish there was some sort of delivery during COVID19 because I'm really craving our usual of a regular chorizo and a super de pollo asado. :((((</Review>

< Review>
Way too expensive! Have you guys gone crazy? $4,75 for a taco and $5 for a cheese quesadilla is just ridiculous! The tacos at El Techo (an upscale rooftop bar in the mission) are cheaper than yours. Food is good an all but the current price is just ridiculous.< /Review>

Bring your appetite and cash dollars. Carnitas and fish are both everything you want in a real taco. Already planning to return the next time I’m in SF for a burrito.< /Review>

<Text>Carne Asada Burrito ✔✔🔥🔥
Maria is amazing! She suggested to upgrade to a super burrito- and told me they can make items that are not listed on the menu.
I was initially craving a chorizo and egg taco- and saw that they offered a variety of choices.
Went to my go to- and was not disappointed.
Check them out.< /Text><user_id>111793499729445145835<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

Delicious, giant, cheap.
Their default spicyness level tends to be low, so if you like spicy, make sure to ask for extra spicy.<//Review>

Good food, just seriously lacking in spices. If you like things spicy, you'll want to load up on the salsa. The taste was good, just a bit bland, honestly. Tons of value, the portions sure are huge. There's no way I could eat a whole burrito there. The guacamole was bland as well - spice it up, folks!</text>

This place has got it all. Make sure to grab the carnitas because they are made perfectly here. I can recommend the food top to bottom from burritos and tacos to nachos and enchiladas. The service is super fast. Don't forget to bring some cash since it is a cash only location. They also have a pretty unique jukebox of you are into that sort of thing.<//review>

The staff was nice. The food is delicious, not really expensive and you have several choices to go for. They also closed pretty late which is a plus. I recommend it.<//text>

<Text>Had the al pastor burrito and loved every bite. The salsa bar was awesome, too! Very flavorful and inexpensive. Cheap beer, too.

Grilled to order. Carnitas tacos omg. Pile on the salsa bar items. Fresh squeezed juices cheap. Fun jukebox. Sometimes, handsome manly men shoveling your meats on the griddle. Shrimp cocktail, cheap.<//Text>

This spot is pretty solid for their burritos, can definitely find cheaper on mission. Open late which is a plus. Went for the wet burrito, I got the red and it was a bit over powering with tastes of cinnamon. My partner got the green and that was way better. I got the carne Asada which was tasty, think the pastor was better. They were friendly and the salsa bar was solid.</Text>

Great burritos and great nachos in a nice setting.
We tried the carnitas, pollo, chorizo and carne asada and they were all excellent.  All the items were super tasty, well balanced and generously sized.  My one knock was that the guacamole seemed a bit light on avocado and had more "filler" material than I prefer.
Still - a 4-star burrito place for sure.</Text>

<Review>Great food quick!  On a busy day it can be a little like the Seinfeld Soup Nazi so make sure you know what you want when you get to the window.  Once you get the hang of it, the chefs are actually very nice and the food is great!  Great salsa bar also.

Englishman abroad, looking for really good burritos.  I've tried a few in SF and this one is definitely one of my favourites.  Solid, large, very tasty.  Also it was almost geometrically perfect.  I don't think I've had a burrito so well rolled as here.  Stayed easy-to-eat from start to finish.  Definitely recommend.</text>

The green guac-sauce and chips and salsa were delicious. Enjoyed the beans and rice. The enchilada sauce was interesting. There was something in it (nutmeg, cinnamon?) that I did not care for, but enough guac sauce and I didn't notice.<//Text>

Amazing burritos which can potentially fill two people, their portion size is huge. Great place for a quick bite. This is cash only place.</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>We eat at el castillito once a week and i have been eating there for almost 2 decades now.

I consider it to be one of the top 3 taquerias in san francisco.

In my opinion they have the best al pastor (marinated pork) in the entire city.

The super meat burrito is substantial enough that we often split one between 2 people.

The super tacos are the perfect lunch/afternoon snack.

We live around the corner but i often go there to sit at the window and people watch while having tacos.

Some people may also like how they ask you the type of beans, rice and other fillings right there as they are making it in front of you.

My recommendation (careful as this is mucho caliente): regular meat burrito with al pastor, black beans, spicy salsa, everything on it, extra jalalenos, extra salsa roja.

The chips are not the best in the city but they are good enough. The salsa bar has the basics.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

That was by far the worst Mexican food I have ever had in my life.. the red sauce comes out of a jug that they had a pop in the microwave to warm it up and they use sliced cheese. They're red sauce tasted like pure maybe nutmeg with cinnamon, 6 guys on the other side of the counter working shouting and chaotic and they weren't even busy they just act like they were really busy. They put my burrito in the microwave and I had to wait like 10 minutes to get it. I feel sorry for people who actually like this place because they don't know what really good food is I will never return</text>

Delicious food! Love their fresh juices!! But they won't let you pay by card. It's Cash only! Bad idea, in this day and time. Very inconvenient. This may keep me from going back some time, not because the good is bad, sometimes I just don't have (or can't withdrawl) cash. If you start accepting cards, I'll change my rating to 5☆!

The workers tend to be rude to customers and the food is not fresh at all. All the ingredients have that preservative taste as if they came from a can. Plus, the nachos are always super soggy because they microwave them for way too long. Better options out there.<//review>

This is my favorite favorite taco place in the WORLD, hands down. Order the taco antojito, they will pile on ingredients until you can no longer see the tortilla.</text>

Very possibly the best burrito in SF. Having done several burrito chllanges, comparing different places and El Castillito is hands down the best. Perfect spice, balance of flavor and tortilla.</review>

Huge burritos! Mine was very good, but I definitely should have asked for cheese. Make sure you pay attention to what's included on the menu and ask for anything that's missing. They make the burritos eight there in front of you. Freshly cracked eggs. Tastes great! I appreciate the fresh ingredients. It's a dive, which is just what we look for.

The only real drawback was that the cashier was pretty racist and made a big scene in the restaurant. My boyfriend gave her a $20 to pay for our food. She didn't check it at all, but then this African American guy comes in and she's all inspecting his bill and claims that it's fake.. Poor guy, he walked out of there without any food at all. It was pretty rude.

Overall thought the food was great. Really good chips! But no queso :( guess that's not a thing in California< /Review>< Pictures>

This place is incredible! The food is delicious (some of my favorite Mexican food in the city) and for those who don't like cilantro, you can get guacamole sin cilantro!! The chips are legit.</text>

FInally made it over here after having it on my bookmark list forever. I was here in the middle of 2018 but didn't review it for some reason. Anyways that's about to change. I was very hungry after work and wanted something fast, so a quick Lyft over and food time. They made a great massive burrito my wife got and I had the Sauza Quesadilla, which was very large and well done. Super cheap too! Would go back.</Review>

I didn't know there were burritos this good outside the mission, but apparently there are.  Great spot to grab lunch in the middle of the city, and if you get the al pastor super burrito, prepare to be amazed.< /text>

Update 10 November 2018:

Outstanding still however older female clerk with short hair is still rude and attempts to charge more then you owe.

After years of getting the same thing, she continues to attempt to charge me for something else.

My last encounter she attempted to charge me for a special burrito with steak/shrimp even though I got a regular carnitas.

1-5pm on Monday to Thursday is $6.99 for regular burritos yet she charged me 10.57 for my regular burrito.

I doubt she will ever learn since it was same issues years ago but it’s frustrating nonetheless

Regular: 8.99
Super: 10.79

Older Review:

This place provides outstanding high quality burritos

Consistently tasty though over the years has steadily increased in price ( in fairness what hasn’t )

Recommend the carnitas

Regular burrito is now roughly 9.30 after taxes< /review>

As you read, no-frills is a very accurate description of this place which delivers punchy flavours in a tavern-like fashion. Just dig in and trust the word of mouth feedback, you'll probably find it harder to enjoy Mexican food in posher places afterwards.</text>

< Review>
Probably one of the better taquerias in this area of town. The beef and the chicken are fantastic. I want the pork to be good given the tasty spit they have hanging but unfortunately it is dry :(. Burritos are huge, their  tacos are also of large size for a relatively reasonable price. The torta is an interesting little bit worth getting but probably also worth splitting with someone since it is huge. All and all this place is a great place to get the Mission fix outside of the Mission.</Review>

7 years eating here and I could still come for lunch everyday. I love their huevos rancheros, but it can be to much food. I always get the same,  whether as a taco out burrito: vegetarian, no cheese, rice, black beans, spicy salsa, onions, tomatoes, cilantro. Then I put their green salsa on every bite. Never disappointed.</text>

This is the type of Mexican restaurant that will make every New Yorker stop dead in their tracks. Unassuming. Rugged. Authentic. It's the type of cuisine you'd expect to only find in the depths of Parts Unknown, but allas here we are in the center of it all, San Francisco.

This isn't your grandma's ricearoni joint. This is straight up south of the border home cooking. Every man has his vice. At El Castillito, expertly named for a famous castle, I found mine...the vegetarian burrito.

Ordering from the man behind the counter repping the SF Giants hat, I can tell he is ready for business...he is ready to serve up the burrito that will make my night. Assertive, yet attentive, he asks me to make some of the hardest choices of the evening. Black beans or pinto beans? Cilantro? You get the drill. Once the bad boy is all wrapped up, he gives it another 30 seconds on the oven to heat up to a perfected crisp. Perfection at last.

After paying what is due, I make sure to grab some salsas and slather my burrito up. It's time to induldge. The crescendo of the evening is finally here. I take the first bite, the salsa verde hitting my palate doesn't hold back. Excellence. They don't make it this good in NYC. The first bite, game over. This is it. Satisfaction at long last. And I still have the entire burrito to go.

If you're in the neighborhood, try El Castillito. You won't be disappointed. And if you are, it's definitely you.< /text>

Mediocre al pastor fatty/gristley supposed hot sauce isn't hot but a sweet watery mess.

Notice the good reviews come from people who don't have any experience.  Cheap? No. I can show you better ones from taco trucks at half the price.<//Text>< response>

OBNOXIOUS staff and the food is totally overrated. I seriously have no idea why some of the other reviewers like this place the meat is too salty and not really fresh at all. There are dozens of much much better taquerias in SF.< /Review><user_id>116278574860150581972< /user_id>< rating>

Probably one of the better taquerias in this area of town. The beef and the chicken are fantastic. I want the pork to be good given the tasty spit they have hanging but unfortunately it is dry :(. Burritos are huge, their  tacos are also of large size for a relatively reasonable price. The torta is an interesting little bit worth getting but probably also worth splitting with someone since it is huge. All and all this place is a great place to get the Mission fix outside of the Mission.< /Review>

Not fancy, great food, reasonable prices. Can get a little crowded and noisy on busy nights so I usually take out.< /Text>

Small place, low prices, large portions (taco salad).  Friendly.  Freshly prepared juices.  A bit dingy.  Wires and extention cords are daisy-chained all over.<//review>

<Text>Their tacos are great (especially the al pastor), but their burritos are even better. If you get one, make sure to ask for it dorado (grilled).

The only downside is that they're cash only, so come prepared.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

This is probably the best taqueria in the city outside the Mission. They put cheese on the tortilla while it's on the grill, so it gets all awesomely melty inside your burrito.</Text>

I have been eating here for over ten years, and I have yet to find a burrito anywhere in the City I actually prefer over a good Chorizo Super Burrito on a Spinach tortilla with salsa verde and fresh juice from El Castillito. Rather conveniently, it isn’t too far from where I live either. Even if it feels like too much food that day, they have excellent tacos and tortas, just perfect for when you want something light, but zesty!

If you ever find yourself on this part of Church St., do stop by and check it out, I guarantee you will not regret it!</Review>

<text>One knows not the burrito unless one has eaten a Mission burrito. Having eaten almost exclusively Chipotle burritos until visiting El Castillito, this was like visiting burrito paradise. Upon the suggestion of a friend, I passed up popular mainstays such as El Farolito and La Taqueria for this place that isn't even technically in Mission, situated on the "wrong" side of Market, aka the north side.< /text>< name>

I'd previously described la palma as my favorite taquiera in the city. el castillito takes that number one spot.

cool little taquiera, bomb al pastor super burrito. my wife ordered the horchata; her and my kids loved it.

very nice people, good service, very good salsas, plus charred jalapenos! definitely will be back soon.  must try</Text>

The best burrito I know with a lot of flavours and a lot of choices.  It can be a little hard to hear what the chef says behind the counter,  but except that everything is good at this place.< /Text>

I'd previously described la palma as my favorite taquiera in the city. el castillito takes that number one spot.

cool little taquiera, bomb al pastor super burrito. my wife ordered the horchata; her and my kids loved it.

very nice people, good service, very good salsas, plus charred jalapenos! definitely will be back soon.  must try</Text>

I love their quesadilla al castillito. It's a quesadilla but it's as big as a burrito. Loaded with ingredients and very juicy.<//Review>< Pictures>

Hands down my favorite place in SF. When I'm away and come back to SF, THIS is the place I come to as soon as I get back in the city. Carnitas tacos are my go-tos, but I've tried a lot of different things here and haven't been disappointed at all.<//Text>

The vegetable burrito wasn't as tasty as I was led to expect, but it is cheap at $5.75. The green sauce is really nice.</text>

I mean it was so good I just sat and and day dreamed about it for a while after the last bite.  I almost felt obligated to cuddle with the wrapper or something afterward.

I would normally deduct:
- 1/2 star for inconsistent quality since I wasn't that impressed the 1st time
- 1/2 star for cash only and forcing me to take 96 cents in change

However, I'll give it an extra credit star for the mind-altering deliciousness.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< rating>

<review>I used to say this was my favorite taqueria outside of the mission. But now it's just my favorite period. They melt sliced cheese right on the tortillas.

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>Get the green tomatillo sauce. I don't care if you're only there for a glass of freshly made (squeezed? pressed?) carrot juice: get the green tomatillo sauce. It is just creamy and just spicy enough to be the perfect complement to any item on the menu at El Castillito.

The quesadilla el castillito (con pollo o carne asada) is a perennial favorite and a worthy vessel for the green tomatillo salsa. The friendly cook always tricks me into speaking Spanish, and I oblige up until he asks me what kind of beans I want with my quesadilla and I have to say, "Frijoles...uh...refried-o".

Another secret is the vegetable burrito, which you can pair with the green tomatillo sauce. The vegetable burrito is packed with grilled veggies and is both cheaper and tastier than the plain bean and rice business that is the vegetarian burrito.

You can ask for chips at the cash register. I always do because eating chips dipped in green tomatillo salsa is normal and drinking a cup of green tomatillo salsa neat is not.< /Text><date>1414449078953<//date>< gmapID>
