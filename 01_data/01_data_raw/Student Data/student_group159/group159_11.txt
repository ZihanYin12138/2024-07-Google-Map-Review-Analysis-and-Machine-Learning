For the very first time I actually enjoyed going to that establishment before I had anxiety, I was always nervous, but this time I felt at ease I felt calm relaxed I went in, and the situation was taken care of quickly and easy, the person that served me, did it with professionalism and a smile...
From getting a park waiting in line to be served going in and coming out it took all of 30 to 45 minutes everyone there was very polite helpful and courteous...it's sad to say that covid-19 had to bring this about  however The Most High God knows exactly what he's doing all Praises to The Most High God...💯💯💯< /Text>

<Review>Sent to this office to get my Food Stamp Card and provide a copy of my ID. All they had to do was log the ID and hand me my card. Which was all done. Money at 5 they said. SURPRISE! No money. I wanted an extra day to be sure and had nothing over the weekend. Now I've been on hold for over 2.5 hrs. ANY OTHER COUNTY it's honestly same day service. Looks like this office has plenty of bad reviews.</Review><Response>None<//Response>< name>

I had it good and bad but all I can say is keep praying for these workers and God give you the outstanding ones. Just pray for the workers trying to assist us they go thur a lot mentally themselves. However I thank all the outstanding workers that assisted me in my time of need. It's makes what the bad workers did not worth giving them any lime light.<//text>

Greetings to All, since the pandemic thing's have really picked up even though the wait is outside in a line so usually go early about 9a.m. to get in and finish paperwork or by 3 or 3:30 p.m. to drop it off or to take care of the not so demanding detail's that aren't so time consuming enjoy your day.<//text>

Horrible! Sends Food benefits, then cuts them for no reason.
When trying to reapply not given correct information. Tells me a million things I'm suppose to remember over the phone and does not send a letter with document requirements like they said they would do.
Case worker unresponsive.
Called and transferred to answering machine... Thanks.< /review>

<Review>This area location does not feel safe. However, the staff is nice and friendly. The Hayward location is a much better option in my opinion.

I would not visit this location with children due to the crowd of "men" lingering around the front of the building. Not exactly a review I wanted to write but a necessary one.</Review><gmap_id>0x808f80aeee440e57:0xdafb34648d21de7b< /gmap_id><Rating>2< /Rating>< user>

Tiara Mays is a racist. Make sure you do not interact with her if you are white. She will talk down to you and make sure you are not helped. When I asked for her name so I could write a complaint, she wouldn't give it to me, all she would say is "Window 16", luckily was able to attain her name from a coworker. I'm positive it's the same lady that another reviewer is talking about below. Out of her mind.<//Text>

The staff can be really hit or miss. Some staff members are very nice and professional, while others have a rude tone and want to get things over with. Also, there seems to be a lot of contradictory information between the staff, someone will tell you one thing and someone else says the opposite. But they get the job done, even if it takes forever!< /Text>

This is the first time I had to apply for food stamp in 28 years after losing my job.  I was there recently and on the first day, I waited 2 hours to submitted my application.  The worker was super nice.  She gave me an appointment for the next day.

I came in for my scheduled appointment the next day.  The gentleman worker was also very nice and helpful. He was ver kind though he didn't smile.  I was able to get my food stamp card the same day.  I didn't have food at home for days and this was very helpful.  Thank you so much for your help.<//Text>

I went there prepared with a couple books and games loaded in my phone. But surprisingly everything moved along very fast. It took about 15-20 minutes for me to receive help. Everything was so swift. Those working behind the desk were efficient and fast not too pleasant but at the same time they weren't rude which I didn't mind because they were more focused on speed then making small talk!!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾< /Review>

<rating>3<//rating><Text>Better services than most areas of CA. The social workers in particular, while competent, are so overloaded with cases and lacking in adequate organization, are very slow to produce results. I waited for 6+ hours to see a social worker and all I received was lip service. That is, until I began to fill out a complaint/review form, then the social worker decided to see me immediately seemingly to avoid a poor review. She proceeded to argue the case for why I shouldn't write a poor review and would not focus on my case after repeated coaxings. If everyone giving poor reviews on here began filling out the Social Services own complaint forms that are available in multiple languages in nearly every room (and used coherent/focused verbiage) we might make a better impact on changing their status quo.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808f80aeee440e57:0xdafb34648d21de7b</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>This service lacks compassion , they have social workers who won't process your case for several months , mean while your struggling to make a doctors appointment and you medical issues are just getting worse. I'm a college student who doesn't have time to balance , the least my social worst could do was do her job, you know people  something is wrong if a 19 years old is literally battling this "system" to make a doctors  appointment , call me biased or tainted but social workers who have no experience in this field , please do the families who depend on these services a favor and be competent or just find another job! Bit this is temporary only this service doesn't really care about you although they are overloaded, don't get comfortable this  isn't something you can rely on....< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808f80aeee440e57:0xdafb34648d21de7b</Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Cut cost by furloughing ALL of the humans Monday-Friday. Replace with non-emotional,  non-powertripping, ROBOTS to service the people in need. Let's face it, the county social services socialist lack compassion and empathy anyway. Last time I checked robots don't need retirement packages, salaries, time-off or any other luxuries working people get in exchange for their non-services.<//Review>< pictures>

Chi and Angela are our bi-weekly team, and they are amazing! The house looks better than it did during the open house with their work. They use all-natural products so it's safe for my girls and my pets. I don't know what I'd do without them.< /Review>

We have been using Zen maids for over a year now. We are very happy for their service. Morgan is very responsive, very easy to communicate. Our regular team are Chi and Angela. We LOVE them. They are always happily arriving our house. My almost 2 year old daughter loves them being around. They do excellent job in cleaning our house, and always inspire me organizing my daughter’s toys and books.</Text>

<Text>We own a vacation house in Palm Desert and have used Zen Maids many times and always been very pleased with their cleaning. My son and daughter in law lived in the house for 8 months recently and arranged for Zen Maids to do a deep cleaning when they moved out. We were finally able to go to the house, 3 months after it had been cleaned, and I was AMAZED with the quality of work that they did! Everything was so clean and shiny and fresh - even 3 months after the service! I will happily continue to give Zen Maids my business!

Claudia and her team moved efficiently through our condo leaving it spotless and gleaming. The ratings convinced us to try this service and we find they are well deserved.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I won’t deny it, I’m a hard to please customer when it comes to cleaning. I keep my home immaculate, and we have a vacation home in Palm Desert which we rent out. We live in the U.K. so cleaning it ourselves is impossible. Initially, we tried another cleaner who came recommended, what a horror they were. I then came across Zen maids and almost at the same time, a neighbour told me that they also use them and highly recommended them to us. I was impressed by the initial home visit, the cleaning schedule list that they ran through made me feel reassured that nothing would be missed. They were accommodating to specific requests and made me feel valued and appreciated, and communication over email is easy. When we returned to Palm Desert, having had a 2 month renter, our home was just as I’d left it and thoroughly clean.  If you have high standards, Zen maids are the cleaning team to give you peace of mind.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1561396244089, 'text': "Good Morning Rachel,  I'm please the Zen Maids crew exceeded your expectations!

<rate>5<//rate><review>Another rental season in the desert is in full swing and for the third year now, Zen Maids have made our lives so much easier!  We live in San Diego and own a condo in Palm Desert. As we still work full time we can’t get there to enjoy it as often as we like so we rent it out on a monthly basis.  Morgan has been our primary contact and is organized, efficient and responsive to communication in a timely manner. All we do is provide her with check in and departure dates and she makes sure the condo is sparkling and ready for guests. There has never been a complaint from renters, in fact there have been compliments. They will do special requests as well, most recently cleaning the fireplace thoroughly after a guest put the gas on too high resulting in a sooty substance on the paint. BBQ  cleaning and patio set up can be added for an extra nominal cost. So happy we found Zen Maids!  Consistent and excellent service for the owner and our renters!</review>< resp>

I’m so impressed with every aspect of my Zen experience. From my inquiry email, initial visit to assess my condo, follow-up emails, and my first cleaning...it’s all been terrific. Morgan is so helpful and efficient with scheduling and answering my many questions. And Aleyda and Patty did a superior job cleaning. I feel so comfortable leaving my place in their hands to take care of my guests during the winter rental season. And I can’t wait to get back next summer and have them continue to pamper me! Thanks to all.< /Review>

Just had to write and share an updated review! This company is amazing!   We own a condo where we recently had new tile installed in the majority of the home.  We arrived on Wednesday late afternoon and discovered a home covered in dust!  We literally could write our name in the residue.  It was on the furniture, walls and even the newly installed tile needed cleaning!  After dealing with the contractor and Lowes, we called Kassie to see if by some miracle she had anyone available to clean our condo the next day (the 4the of July!).  It was after 5:00 so we really didn't expect a call back and were pleasantly surprised when she notified us that someone would arrive at 8:00 am.  Sure enough Nancy arrived right on time, and began a thorough cleaning of the condo.  Now that is service above and beyond!  Thank you Zen Maids.< /Review>

We have been using Zen Maids for about 2 months now and are super happy with their service.  Communication with Morgan was quick and easy from setting up our consultation to the scheduling of reoccurring services (every 2 weeks).  I like that they bring their own cleaning supplies and are pet friendly.  Our team does a great job every time and for me knowing that the house is clean allows me to spend more time doing other things that need to get done.< /text>

<Review>If there were 6 stars, they would get them!
Six years ago, I needed a cleaning of our condo before the movers arrived. Kassie responded promptly and said she would fit me it. They did such a wonderful job and were so great to work with. I have booked Zen Maids on a regular basis ever since!
It couldn't be nicer to be able to count on them for promptness, reliability and, above all else, outstanding work . . . and this is time and time again!!
My condo is always sparkling inside and out after each visit.
I couldn't be happier with Kassie and her crew at Zen Maids. They are wonderful and so professional!

Since then, I've had them come for routine cleaning...and am now scheduling them for regular visits every two weeks.

The best service by far I have had for my vacation rental in Cathedral City. They really bend over backwards to accommodate when I have last minute bookings, or if I forget to schedule a clean. In the couple years I have used them not once has a guest complained about the cleanliness. I can’t say the same when I was cleaning it myself. I consider myself lucky to have found them.< /text>

Just had Zen Maids for the first time and they were great!!! I already have them booked for my next visits into town. Everything is sparkling clean and I love how they fluffed the tissue in the Kleenex boxes, nice touch. Very professional and being able to easily pay via Intuit is very convenient. I can't recommend them enough. Choose them and you won't be disappointed!< /review>

I recently had knee replacement surgery and with 3 dogs it doesn't take long for the house to look "lived in". I asked that they concentrate on the corners and baseboards along with the general cleaning. The place looks amazing now. The fact that they only use green products is the cherry on top. Everything sparkles and smells clean with no residual sweet smell. Will definitely recommend and use them more! Thanks Megan!</review>< Pics>

<Text>I have used Zen Maids for years now.  I have them clean after the grandkids, kids, and I have spent time in our desert house and have left it a mess. I return to a clean, neat, ordered environment with small, delightful touches like the tissue box decorated with a folded tissue. Scheduling Zen Maids is wonderfully easy.  I highly recommend them.</Text>< pics>

<text>Tried other cleaning services and Zen Maids is by far the best. Reliable and thoroughly professional. One of their best business practices is to send the same crew each time so the crew is familiar with my home. I look forward to the appointment every time<//text><user_name>laura nachison< /user_name>< GmapID>

The first time I had Zen Maids out to my house I have to say it was OVER DUE for a cleaning. There was a little problem that I was not happy about but, the outstanding result was that this company "did the right thing." They reviewed the situation and offered me a free 2 hr cleaning next time. WHAT?? You admitted the fault,apologized and rectified it with grace. FANTASTIC Morgan you have a customer for life. Plus, their products are non-toxic so my house doesn't smell like it was douched with bleach like the one prior to Zen. Thumbs Up</Text>

Zen Maids is the BEST!! I consider myself a neat freak, and often times end up being frustrated with other cleaners I’ve tried bc I feel like I could do a better job. But I’ve been using zen maids regularly for the past 2 years and have no complaints. They are professional, on time, and leave my house so clean every time!! I would and do recommend them 100%!!!</review>

I own a vacation rental co. I am very picky when it comes to keeping the homes clean and have gone thru many cleaning companies. Zen Maids is by far the best I have worked with.
Homes are always cleaned. They do a very thorough job, I never have to call for them to come back to reclean anything . After they clean I feel confident, my guest will walk into a clean home. Towels neatly folded, no crumbs or hairs in drawers. Most cleaners miss the details, not them...
Kassie and Morgan - are on top of the scheduling and so easy to work with.< /text>

< review>
Nice little plaza with 3 restaurants...we decide to eat at the Chicago Bro's Pizzaria. It's a nice little place with really good food. We had a Philly cheese steak sandwich and a medium meat lovers pizza,  came out to $32.22. The food was delicious. Next time we're in this plaza we'll stop at McGregor's Grill and Ale House, they had a live band playing this Friday night.<//review>

{'time': 1620250651288, 'text': 'Dear Victoria,\n\nFirstly, we would like to apologize for the inconvenience this has been on all parties involved.\n\nAs most businesses in San Francisco are just starting to reopen, after over a year of being completely closed, we have had to hire and re-train staff en masse. During this time of economic hardship, our shop has been burglarized and vandalized several times and many bikes have been stolen. Therefore, we’ve taken measures to avoid more loss; this unfortunately affected you.\n\nThe staff member assisting you made a mistake, which we do apologize and take full responsibility for. Said mistake led us to believe that you still had the bikes in your possession and had not returned them when due. We then tried all avenues to reach you and inquire about the bikes including texts and phone messages.\n\nAt the time of rental, we authorized the credit card you gave us for deposit, provided for the case of stolen or lost equipment. After nearly 24 hours of trying to reach your party and without a response, and as a course of normal business, we used that amount to cover loss assuming the bikes had been stolen.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback on the employees who assisted you. As we thrive on our outstanding customer service, we have taken measures to make sure this will not happen again.\n\nLastly, kindly understand the situation from our side; following an explosive pandemic, the severity of expensive equipment being lost or stolen is simply not sustainable.\n\nAgain, we are very sorry with this mishap and we hope you enjoyed riding with us.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAndrew'}< /response>

< Review>
Worst experience ever.
DO NOT RENT WITH THESE PEOPLE.
We rented 4 electric bikes on April 18th, we paid the full amount in cash but they kept our credit card details until we returned our bikes. We returned the bikes on the same date before 6pm as they asked and they retuned the credit card details.
On the following afternoon they started to call us and they sent a bunch of messages asking for the bikes. They contacted us on facebook, instagram and they even sent a message to my working place asking for the bikes, implying that we stole them. Not to mention that they called the hotel in which we stayed, not being successful in finding us as we had already checked out. Once we could finally get in touch, we explained that the bikes were already returned and they explained that their employee(the one who received the biked) did NOT check the bikes as returned.
Today, May 2nd, I realised Bay City Bikes CHARGED me 1.000 dollars on my credit card. I called them and they checked their system, which confirmed the payment.
When I called the company to check out how they were refunding the money and, of course, to complain about the “mistake”, a very rude employee did not even listen to me, she only explained that the money was refunded and her next word was “bye”.
What really got my attention was that the payment for the 1000 dollars  was made on April 19th, a day after I got my credit card details “RETURNED”.

CONCLUSION:
1. Their employee never checked our bikes as returned
2.They harassed us asking for their bikes when the mistake was theirs.
3. They implied in messages that we stole their bikes.
4. They charged us 1000 dollars for the bikes which WE RETURNED IN PLACE AND TIME.
5. They kept my credit card details against my authorisation.
6.They were rude and impolite on the phone when talking on the matter.< /Review>

Went to store (which was less than a block from our hotel) and the pricing and options by buying onsite were different. Online you were only given full day option while you could rent hourly at the store. We were only riding bikes for 1 hour so i tried to change at store before we started.  The store employees were unable to help and recommend I follow up with site customer service. Customer service was NO HELP. Offered free rental next time but I live across the country.

{'time': 1603669238945, 'text': 'Dear Art,\nThanks for reaching out. We are sorry to hear that your experience with us was less than exceptional. On our website we offer full day rentals, at a 20% discount by booking online in advance. The only way to reserve your bike, and secure it is saved for you, is to make a reservation online for the day with the discount. We also offer walk—up hourly rates that are first come first serve Typically because the equipment is pulled from our fleet and saved for you, we cannot switch from a full day reservation, to an hourly rental. It sounds like our staff tried to make it up to you by offering you the difference in a credit for future use. We hope to see you again on another bike ride soon.\nThanks Again!\nAndrew'}</resp>

This company is threatening legal action against me because a wheel was stolen from the bike when it was properly locked. They attempted to charge my card 3 separate times for $200, $200, and $150, respectively for a WHEEL. They stalked me and my newlywed wife on our honeymoon and sent us ultimatums that promised legal action and that they would CONTACT OUR PERSONAL EMPLOYERS if we didn’t resolve the theft of a portion of the bike that we responsibly secured. This is the pay day loan version of a bike rental company. Never do business with them. Officer Richins, Badge 753, SFPD. Please, Bay City Bikes, contact that police officer. It would have been nice if you didn’t hang up when you were on speakerphone with me and the SFPD officer. But alas, you are a bottom of the barrel company.

Maybe you could sell fiction after you run every last customer away. Best of luck to you.<//Review>

Still, when you started the phone call by cursing to our staff, it was impossible to work something out. You refused to take any accountability and instead made unreasonable demands. You further advised that prior to calling us had already cancelled your credit card to prevent us from having financial recourse. Presumably, you intermittently blocked phone numbers / would not answer calls (as we did try to call you back many times to work it out as well as determine where you abandoned the bike).\n\nIt is common practice in the rental business that you must return the equipment you temporarily took possession of; upon rental one signs a legal contract agreeing to take care of the borrowed property. Had you been at minimum polite and coherent, this situation would not have escalated. This may be a lesson to learn as you just got married and have a life ahead of you learning to share responsibilities with your partner, and perhaps eventually showing your future children accountability and regard for others. Your behavior completely showed utter disregard and disrespect for a small businesses that is trying really hard to survive in a worldwide pandemic.\n\nAshley"}< /Resp><gmapID>0x808580e382249c11:0x1723738e129e95cf</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We had the best experience here renting bikes. We found them on Google and wanted to bike across the Golden Gate bridge. They matched us with bikes that were perfect for how short I am and how tall my husband is. We filled out the paperwork and were on our way. We biked over the bridge and into Sausalito. Once we had lunch we did not want to bike back, so we got on the ferry and didn't have any problem returning the bikes. Great experience! I highly recommend them and their friendly staff.< /Text>

Rented the bikes at 1230 pm and then biked the Golden Gate then back to the hotel; the next morning we biked down Lombard Street and dropped them back by 1200 the next day.  Now we can brag about biking down the longest crookest street in America and across the most iconic bride of America.</Text>

Amazing experience. Bring a jacket for the windy bridge.

Cycles not maintained properly, grips are nasty and chains need lubricant.<//Text>

Great experience! I'd reserved my road bike for the Escape from Alcatraz online and provided my specs (both processes really easy). In the background, team identified a potential problem in the sizing I'd provided. When I arrived, in spite of being busy (on account of the race) my bike was ready as planned and they moved quickly to swap it for a better size.

The bike was a great ride for the race!<//review>

Be careful with this provider - very dodgy business!
After our rental one store manager charged our credit card without any legal permission with a fee which was not written in the contract.

They charged 15$ per bike (and discussed even about 20$ per bike before) even there was just a 10$ per bike written in the contract.

Even after some discussion with the manager and the head of the store, we didn’t receive our unrightfully charged money back until today.

Therefore cannot recommend at all.<//review>

Worst service I've ever had, the bikes where 25 dollars, but the bag was missing, I'm not eaven sure if they've dilvered the bag in the first place ore maybe it got stolen, they charged me an additional 27 dollars for a simple bag. While I Never knew if I had it in the first place. Afther they spoke about 'you should've bought ensurense' but I didn't eaven knew this was an option.</text>

Really friendly service and very helpful in choosing the right bike for the distance I was looking to cover. I got an electric bike and it was very worth the money. Nearly all but the steepest hills were not too difficult, I was passing serious bikers, and I was able to bike over 20 miles without a sweat. I definitely recommend Bay City Bikes to anyone looking to rent a bike.<//Text>

<Text>We were British tourists exploring the city by bike and we found the shop very helpful.
Our bikes were in good nick and we were provided with locks, helmets and a map.
Liz and Sonoma were kind and showed us the route that goes to golden gate bridge, through presidio then golden gate park. We returned them to a different point right next to the park (they charged us extra but we were told about this)

<rating>4</rating><Review>We rented two city bikes from Bay City Bike Rental. The bikes were very comfortable and had good gears and breaks (which is very needed in the steep streets of SF).

We got a recommendation from the staff regarding which routes to take and the recommendations were quite useful to us.

In our experience, the staff was very friendly and helpful

The only thing that could have been better were the locks for the bikes. They were a bit small to be able to tight the frame and the back tire to the bike stand. Also one of the two locks we got was a bit worn out.

We would recommend this place for renting a bike in SF :)< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I loved this !! Last year I used a different company to hire a bike to go across the Bridge and it was horrible. This year I brought some friends and was so happy we stumbled across this place !! The staff were so helpful & patient and made sure the bikes suited us well (lots of us hadn't ridden bikes since we were kids and are now in our 20s so bit daunting!) and they ensured we knew where we were headed. The bikes were so comfy and easy to ride, and the experience of biking across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito is one I won't forget. I highly recommend it if u have an afternoon free in San Francisco :)</Review>

Great customer service, all the employees were really nice and helpful and made sure we were comfortable with the bikes before we took off. They explained the route​ clearly and provided a map.

We rented a performance hybrid and an electric bike, overall they were in decent shape but not great, that's why I'm not giving them 5 stars. They hybrid had a really loud, squeaky front brake and the electric bike's chain fell off at once point though I was able to get it back on fairly easily.

Note that they do put a $200 hold on your credit card.<//review>

<Text>The sunset ride over the Golden Gate Bridge is spectacular and Mike was an excellent guide. I recommend the e-bikes for this ride, because there were a few difficult hills.  You can simply thumb the assist off once you reach the top.  Very rewarding experience.<//Text><user>117301537413784851383</user><username>Adam Gardin<//username></record></dataset><record>

My family rented several bikes from Bay city bike rentals and tours on July 31. There was no sign at the rental station that the minimal rental hour is 2, and the staff did not tell us about the 2 hr minimum rule. When we returned 1 hr later,  we were told about the rule. We told them they should have told us up front. It is unfair that we found out afterwards. We did not use any insulting or dirty words, just clarifying the fact. The staff became very rude at this point. She took out the paper that another staff member asked us to sign, at the bottom of which,  after many lines, there is a line of small words about minimal 2 hr. She then quickly grabbed the paper from us, gave us a new one, saying that "you can rip this one now". This is very insulting to us, but the staff said we insulted her, which is very strange. We were upset and called the number which is picked by a manager named John. After telling him what we want to complain, he said the same thing as the lady, then asked me to hold the phone while he called the station staff. After talking to the staff, the manager said the station staff said she told us about the 2 hr rule, which was a lie, because we were served by another staff when we rented the bike, the staff who served us when we returned the bike was a different person.
We decided to walk to their main office which is a few blocks away since the phone complaint was not useful. We paid the 2 hr rental fee, and just before we wanted to leave, the manager came to the station, and told us that he wanted us the get out of his store. We just purchased their service and supported their business, but he wanted me to get out of his store. This is again very unusual.
We went to their main office, and it turns out the same manager went there too. We requested to talk to a higher level person, and ask for his last name. He refused to give us this information, and said to me, an Asian woman, harassed him, he would call a police, and again asked me to get out of his store. I asked him to call the police and waited outside of the store. A few minutes later, a community mediator came. He explained to me that his job is to protect the store, but he thought that it was obvious that we were not threats. He asked me if it is an issue related to "hour" before I told him what happened. It appears that same thing has happened to this store before. He tried to get the store manager's name and contact information, so that we can continue to communicate with him, but the store manager refused to give his this information. The mediator left and we left too.

This business is a fraud and threat their customers so badly, both are completely unacceptable.<//Text>

Bike was ok, I did not understand why you have to get insurance when it should be included in the rent price, service from management was awful after my rent was over. I had a 5$ promo but the lady didnt tell me it is only for daily Rent, and did not even ask me if i want hourly or daily. When i returned they refused stubburnly  to give me the daily price with the discount. After my review here received a 5$ refund, at least here the service was ok</text>

Très mauvais service client, vélo en panne ou en mauvais état, sans protège chaîne.... FUYEZ !
Nous avons contacté leur service client (voir mail ci-dessous) AUCUNE réponse depuis 2 mois ...

Dear Sir,

We rented on your website 4 bikes Thursday, April 18, 2019.
On your website we chose Square Park removal place which was close to where we were.
Arrived on site we found that your site was closed. Several other people were also waiting ...
After contacting you by phone, which was very difficult, your agent John confirmed that the site would be closed all day and asked us to go to 501 Bay Street.
Uber's first bill of $ 10.11

John upgraded us to an electric bike, which was very nice of him.
After losing 1:30 we finally went for a bike ride.

Unfortunately one of the bikes broke down just beside the vista point of the Gloden Gate Bridge. We contacted John around 12:20 and waited until 14:30 for an exchange!
John told us on the phone that the first driver he sent did not find us there! You will find attached a photo of the 4 bikes and my children where we agreed to wait for your driver. It is impossible that he did not see us. In addition, I could see all the cars that left the highway to enter the vista point car park and I think this first driver has never been there otherwise I would have seen him enter the parking lot.

Finally the second driver arrived, unfortunately the bike that was given to us in exchange did not have a chain protection, my pants are now full of black oil and even tore!

Finally, our friends who had to take us home can not wait any longer we had to take an Uber again to return to Los Gatos.
Second Uber bill of $ 124.97

Due to problems with our rental we lost 3 or 4 hours and spent $ 135 unnecessarily on transportation, not to mention the cost of my pants.
For this I ask you to refund the full amount of the lease 86.07 $ and to add the amount of UBER.
This makes a total of $ 211.04

best regards,<//Review>

They told us we could return our bikes to another location but then were confused when we did and asked us to please take them back to our original location for them. They used paper for credit cards. In San Francisco! My front brake made loud noses the whole trip and when I told them afterwards they didn't seem concerned. Got a cheap rate via Groupon though so I guess it evened out?< /Review>

the bikes are not very sturdy and if they happen to break while using the bike normally they make you (over)pay for the repairs. my luggage carrier was broke and they forced me to pay 45 $ for a piece of metal. when i checked some bikes in the store, they all had the same problem. they told me i should have gotten the insurence a 10$, but actually they make customers pay for their own repairs.</review>

Bikes were ok and staff were very friendly. We were looking for generic bike rental we weren't specifically interested in the bridge route. After cycling 10km across town we discovered there is a $10 charge for returning your bikes to a different store - not cool. Good place to rent just to do the bridge other shops (such as basically free rentals) might be better otherwise.</text>

My wife and I purchased a rental of 2 bikes (1 regular and 1 with a baby seat). They treated the rental as 3 bikes when I returned it at a drop off location and I was charged 3 times for the drop off fee which was not disclosed during our discussion with the representative in store. In addition to the drop off location situation, I had a company representative reach out to me 3 times to ask me the same questions each time (where was it dropped off, what time, and where did you drop of the keys). Each time I told them the same information. What was not disclosed was that you must tell the bike rental store representative that you are dropping it off at a drop off location. Had I known we were supposed to call ahead about dropping off the bikes I would have done it as instructed.

In common with the rest of reviews on here, the bikes were not exactly kept up with the wear and tear. I would not be surprised if we had not purchased the insurance that they would ding us for the minor scratches and other wear and tear parts on the bike.

I will not be using this company again if we are ever back at San Fransisco and warn others to us a different company or to simply read this review as a full disclosure of what to do when you rent "3" bikes.<//Review>< Pics>

Everything was perfect: I got a bike which fitted my height. It ran very smoothly and was in good shape. The german guy that gave it to me was very friendly.</Text>

Very convenient location and helpful staff. Instructions were clear and concise, and the Performance Bike was excellent (lighter body than most rental places we've been to). Be sure to check Groupon for deals as it saves you nearly half the price. The ride to Sausalito and Tiburon, and ferry ride back to San Francisco was very enjoyable and scenic! A must do while you are in SF. We stopped at The Palace of Fine Arts, in Sausalito for ice cream and Tiburon Tavern for happy hour before catching the ferry back to the city.<//text>

They tried to scam us. They said we could return the bikes in Sausalito if we called a number and sent pictures of the bikes locked in the bike rack of bar becco. We did as we were told and followed the instructions (they told us to just leave the keys in a bag that was in the front of the bikes). Then the next day we were told that the bikes were stolen and were charged 800 dollars for the two bikes they reported as stolen. (What kind of bike costs that much?) This is an attempt to take advantage of tourists and I will report this incident with the local authorities.</Review>

I rarely write reviews for places but feel I need to in this case due to my poor experience with Bay City.  My wife and I rented bikes there to sight-see in San Francisco this past week.  About an hour into our ride, my wife's bike broke while changing gears going up a small hill.  Bay City was good about coming out to replace the bike but when we returned later that day, we were told we were being assessed a $45 fee for breaking the bike.  I wouldn’t have minded paying the fee if we had not used proper care with the bike or if something got stolen but to be charged for something that was clearly due to the bike not being in good condition and was no fault of our own was completely ridiculous.  The bike was making noises when she was changing gears throughout the first hour of our ride and it was clear this was not a good bike and was the primary reason for the bike breaking.

When I called Bay City to talk about this further the next day I was told we caused the bike to break due to “user error” from changing gears while going up a hill.  The manager indicated we should have been told this when we rented (we weren’t, we were told to make sure we’re pedaling while changing gears, which she was doing).  Even if we had been told this, I would expect a good bike to at the very most just have the chain come off, not for the entire gear system to break.  Also, if you’re renting bikes in a city like San Francisco, it might be good to have bikes that can withstand changing gears on small hills since there are hills everywhere.

If you are planning on renting bikes in San Francisco, I would strongly recommend not using Bay City.  Any place that will charge you for such a ridiculous thing does not deserve your business.< /Text>

We found a deal for this place on Groupon - 4 bikes for 24 hours only $60 (after a special 20% off). It's a very doable walk to here from the cruise port if you're coming from there like we did. We were so grateful for the Yelp check-in offer of a free water bottle. I used mine when we got the bike and hubby used his when we returned them. We spent an extra $20 for a kids trailer for our seven month old. You can also get a child's seat for the same price. We were all given helmets, which were included in the Groupon price. Just a heads up though - our seventh month old's head was forced forward in an awkward way when wearing the helmet and riding in the trailer. However, the trailer itself was great! We'd never used a trailer before so we looked this one up on line. It's definitely one of the more expensive trailers and had fantastic reviews. If it were to flip, it's steel frame would protect the child.

Service was friendly! My one and only complaint is that they didn't offer a bike with a banana seat - my but was sore at the end of the day!< /text>

Friendly staff and the bikes were relatively new and in great condition.  There are a few bike rental companies that are all roughly in the same location, but I plan to rent from Bay City Bike Rentals in the future too.</Review>

My friend and I had a horrible experience when doing the ride across the Golden Gate Bridge. We booked the ride through a lady in a tourist centre, who didn't even seem sure of what she was doing anyway!! When we turned up for the bike ride they said we can only go if we book the Alcatraz with it as it comes as a package. Well we did want to do the Alcatraz anyway so the man managed to juggle things about and we paid for that trip too. God knows how it all got so cocked up in the first place
Anyway, he told us we had been upgraded to 'hybrid bikes' even though we hadn't requested them...and had never even ridden one before!,
My friend had not been on a bike for many years so when we tried these things out they were far too powerful for us. I kept mine and switched it to manual but she requested an ordinary bike which they gave her, but would not refund the $20 each that they had charged us for having these hybrid bikes!! He did make a concession though and hands us a bottle of water each!
The blurb on the information leaflet says this tour is suitable for families and BEGINNERS
I am here to tell you that this bike ride is NOT for beginners. In fact I thought it was downright dangerous at times. And neither of us (55 year olds) realised when we booked it that it was to end in Sausalito
They young guys who lead (one at the front and one at the back) were ok..especially the one who had to stay at the back with my friend and I ....but I think he was getting a bit worried about us. The front leader guy lied several times that each hill was worse than the next...they were all bad! And when I naively asked how we would get up to the bridge, he said there's an elevator. Yes I know I shouldn't have fallen for that, but it was all so totally unexpected. We had to walk our bikes uphill  quite a few times, but then the downhill slopes and bends were even scarier because some of the roads had no sides!!,
I kept turning round to see if my poor friend was ok, or if she was even still,THERE, and not crushed on the road somewhere.
The bridge itself is very frightening I found, because the seasoned cyclists are all so fast and aggressive, you daren't wobble into their pathway!!
Ok we are glad we achieved it, and got out of it alive, but I do not have any good memories of it. Only getting off the ferry at the end and dumping that bike back on Bay City Bikes! (Thanks to Julius for his patience!)</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Just great,
and one of the best recommendations for San Francisco.

The tour is very well organized. Our tour guide drove up and at the end of the group, someone was careful that no one is lost. It is stopped at regular intervals to get to know. Just before the bridge there's an extra stop (toilet, coffee, ice, ...) to take really good pictures.

The moment when you drive over the bridge - indescribable !! Unfortunately, it is difficult to take pictures because there are logically many people on the way. It is possible. At the end you get the opportunity to stay in Sausalito. Or you can take the ferry back (ticket not included, $ 12 / person, bike is free).
All in all, highly recommended and I would do it again :-) and
So a 100% recommendation from me.

(Original)
Einfach Super,
und eine der Besten Empfehlungen für San Francisco.

Die Tour ist sehr gut organisiert. Unser Tourguide fuhr vor und am Ende der Gruppe hat auch jemand aufgepasst, dass niemand verloren geht. Es wird in regelmäßigen Abständen angehalten, um Wissenswertes erzählt zu bekommen. Kurz vor der Brücke gibt’s nen extra Stop (Toilette, Kaffee, Eis, ...), um wirklich gute Fotos machen zu können.

Der Moment, indem man über die Brücke fährt - unbeschreiblich!! Leider ist es dort schwierig, Fotos zu machen, da dort logischerweise viele Leute unterwegs sind. Es ist aber möglich. Am Ende bekommt man die Möglichkeit, in Sausalito zu verweilen. Oder man fährt gleich mit der Fähre zurück (Ticket nicht mit inbegriffen, 12$/Person, Fahrrad ist frei).
Alles in allem sehr empfehlenswert und ich würde es auch wieder machen :-) und
somit eine 100%ige Weiterempfehlung von mir.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO15hAr3yOeBFNnspYEFTtuCUYMBTQaQVaRUaIv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrmHSgSqa4dR3mXt4KrzPArYY2e67c08p0WzbY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYag70uevRovLVDE71WDv5dgpDdkpgog_aSi5k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlTKm6lvQUYoKcMlalmBgyCRIJjiajtG_L5zLx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJtlSNRVnOMyaoVMAp-1xX8O909SPpM9VIMqY6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFrNMd4VBccFF0kBnkjDlJMVKVY3UWtW865hes=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlZO6m0Ii4bz5y4znI9eiG8Tj6c5LX7qE5CBv8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeW_ExftmbTOnKyQ1zWaOkcRlj831hwXH_eBFB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMgOJhfgG9Oab7xTgr0UHDTyJPIQh0ln40txe_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOm0jxRXc9Mc8kHNXE_eAruYEK3zE_Hz84ioyqB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1GfFobq4ngqe_5YANKNlU1C9_y6xAoKS69Shi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1576521019782, 'text': 'Thank you for sharing your experience with us!

(Translated by Google) Here:
3-hour bike tour over the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito.

Everything great and unique,
you must have experienced it yourself
but …

... there are also two experiences,
which we did not read correctly from the offer description,
or not be mentioned at all ..
On the one hand, one is forced on site,
take out bike insurance for $ 8 (two person) and
on the other hand,
that the tour ends at the port of Sausalito.

That means you have to go back over the bridge alone or
for about $ 25 (2 people) have to take the ferry.

You should also know that an e-bike can be used for an additional charge of USD 25,
but e-bikes cannot be taken on the ferry.

All of this should be included in the offer description,
be expressed in a complementary or clearer way.
Otherwise, a highlight that should not be missing from any sightseeing in San Francisco.

We noticed the tour guide particularly positively,
who carefully looked after our group of around 20 people,
therefore an honest and 100% recommendation from us.

(Original)
Hier:
3-stündigen Fahrradtour über die Golden Gate Bridge nach Sausalito.

Alles super und einmalig,
muss mann selber erlebt haben,
aber …

… es gibt auch zwei Erfahrungen,
die wir aus der Angebotsbeschreibung so nicht richtig herausgelesen haben,
bzw. gar nicht erwähnt werden..
Das ist zum einem, dass man vor Ort genötigt wird,
eine Fahrradversicherung für 8$ (zwei Person) abzuschließen und
zum anderen,
dass die Tour am Hafen von Sausalito endet.

Das bedeutet, man muss alleine über die Brücke wieder zurückfahren oder
für ca. 25$ (2 Personen) die Fähre nehmen muss.

Auch sollte man wissen, dass die Nutzung eines E-Bikes gegen Aufpreis von USD 25 möglich ist,
aber E-Bikes nicht auf der Fähre mitgenommen werden.

Dies alles sollte in der Angebotsbeschreibung,
ergänzend oder deutlicher zum Ausdruck gebracht werden.
Ansonsten, ein Highlight was bei keinem Sightseeing von San Francisco fehlen sollte.

Besonders positiv, war uns der Tourguide aufgefallen,
der sehr umsichtig unsere Gruppe mit ca. 20 Personen betreut hatte,
deshalb eine ehrliche und 100%ige Weiterempfehlung von uns.< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The rental bike was perfect, gearbox and brakes working perfectly. However, they are unable to provide a detailed map (the one provided is too general and imprecise) of the cycle paths. What I did not like is the lack of possibility to take out insurance against theft and that even if it can be established for damages, if you were far away and there was a need to be recovered, you would be charged $ 35 . The most annoying thing, however, concerns the management of the credit card. Request as a deposit, instead of pre-authorizing it for an amount equal to the cost of the bike (I understand that they must be protected) they mark all the data on the card, including the security code. I pointed out to the girl that: (1) there is no caution for them because I can block the card as soon as I leave the store and (2) now they have all the data and could use it without my consent at any time. I was told they are doing this to protect themselves. I replied that I understood, but that was not the way. Nothing, a sampietrino would have understood, she failed.

(Original)
La bici presa a noleggio era perfetta, cambio e freni perfettamente funzionanti. Mancano però di fornire una cartina dettagliata (quella fornita è troppo generica e imprecisa) delle piste ciclabili. Ciò che non mi è piaciuto è la mancanza di possibilità di stipulare di un'assicurazione contro il furto e che anche se si può stabilire quella per danni, nel caso ci si trovasse lontani e ci fosse necessità di venire recuperati, vi verrebbero addebitati 35 dollari. La cosa più fastidiosa riguarda però la gestione della carta di credito. Richiesta come deposito, invece di pre-autorizzarla per un importo pari al costo della bici (capisco che si debbano cautelare) segnano tutti i dati della carta, compreso il codice di sicurezza. Ho fatto notare alla ragazza che: (1) non c'è nessuna cautela per loro perché posso bloccare la carta non appena esco dal negozio e (2) ora hanno tutti i dati e potrebbero utilizzarla senza il mio consenso in qualsiasi momento. Mi è stato risposto che fanno così per cautelarsi. Ho risposto che capivo, ma non era quello il modo. Niente, un sampietrino avrebbe capito, lei non c'è riuscita.</Review>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) Bikes in very bad condition (one with tires completely deflated) and dirty (after 1 hour of the bike we had black hands of grime ..), team very impatient - they fought that we sign a paper write $ 120 on, we had to insist that we have already paid for this service. A quick "sorry for that" whispered, when they understood their mistakes. No baskets on the bike, I did not know what to do with my bag ... In any case, fortunately nothing serious happened to us ... given the condition of the bikes it could have been worse!
* answering you: YES, it was your company no doubt about it and you do not have a basket on your bikes, only a tiny bag before. just walk out of your comfy office and check it!

Vélos en très mauvaises état (un avec des pneus complètement dégonflé) et sales (après 1h de vélo on avait des mains noires de crasse..), équipe très impatient - ils s'acharnaient qu'on signe un papier écris 120$ dessus, on devait insister que nous avons déjà payé pour ce service.  Une rapide "sorry for that" murmuré, quand ils ont compris leur erreurs. Pas de paniers sur le vélo,  je ne savais pas quoi faire avec mon sac...En tout cas,  heureusement que rien de grave nous est arrivé...vu l'état des vélos ça aurait pu être pire !

<text>(Translated by Google) Reserved bike there via network, worked without problems

Paper warfare was processed quickly and professionally until it came to the wheels

First impression of the bikes Was - at least everything on it - if already heavily worn - but just a bike ;-)

No experience how to determine the correct saddle height - the young seller just smiled and uncoiled his usual phrases in the hope of a tip

Please make a test drive before starting the tour !!!
Bike had worn brake pads and the gear shift was also inoperative
Fact: The bikes are not inspected after the rental, but go back 1: 1 to the next customer
Pure business is in the foreground :-(

Note at the end of the tour was met with a tired smile

Loading and travel recommendation otherwise ok

You don't need a helmet in SFO, only annoying with the many photo spots

Bike tour one of the best ways to explore the bay

(Original)
Rad per Netz dort reserviert, klappte problemlos

Papierkrieg wurde schnell und professionell bearbeitet bis  es zu den Rädern kam

Erster Eindruck der Räder War - zumindest alles dran - wenn auch schon stark abgenutzt - aber halt nur ein Fahrrad ;-)

Keine Erfahrung wie man die richtige Sattelhöhe ermittelt - der junge Verkäufer lächelte nur und spule seine üblichen Floskeln in der Hoffnung auf Tip ab

Bitte unbedingt Probefahrt vor Tourstart machen!!!
Bike hatte abgefahrene Bremsbeläge und die Schaltung War auch funktionsuntüchtig
Fakt: die Räder werden nach dem Verleih nicht inspiziert sondern gehen 1:1 wieder an den nächsten Kunden
Reines Geschäft steht im Vordergrund :-(

Hinweis am Touren Ende wurde mit einem müden Lächeln begegnet

Laden und Fahrtempfehlung ansonsten ok

Helm braucht man in SFO nicht, stört nur bei den vielen Fotospots

Radtour eine der besten Möglichkeiten die Bay zu erkunden<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808580e382249c11:0x1723738e129e95cf<//gmap_id></record>

This park is huge!The park has lost of open room and things to see throught out. Be warned the parking garage is a total ripoff!! I ended up spending $33 for parking.In the morning hours independent artists setup their work and try to sell it publicly. Some were out there making new art on the spot. People were doing yoga in the main park. I'm not sure if there is live music everyday but when I was in the main area an orchestra was playing.<//review>

Labor Day weekend in Coral Gambles and decided to walk around the city to check out the non-star sites. Beautiful sized park with many activities going on. You saw the young 50+ and children with parents and pets strolling all over. Nice place to sit down with a book on a good day.< /Text>

<Review>I've been here twice and received excellent customer service. On my second visit, a panel underneath my front bumper got loose and was dangling and scraping the road. Diamond Auto Body was able put it back in for me free of charge since it was super minor work. Super friendly staff, clean facility. I was very comfortable here both times and this will be my first choice auto body shop in the future.< /Review>< pictures>

Run don't walk away, not sure the owner knows what's going on in his business.  They build AAA for a new part, used a used part, it went bad and caused over a thousand dollars in damage, had extra work done wish we had used a check to pay for the extra work. I prefer giving praise.</review>

The most pleasant experience pertaining to automobiles that I have ever had. They fixed the damage to my vehicle within a week (vehicle looks new again) and were extremely professional, prompt, and kind. Not that I want to wreck my car again, but if I did, I know I’d be going back here for the repairs.< /text>

I would give more stars if I could! Took my car in to have some work done, and they did a great job. Aside from the top quality work, I also appreciate their dedication and honesty to costumer service. Not to mention that Arthur and Peter provided me with regular updates and had my car looking like new. Highly recommend Diamond Auto Body &  Paint!!!</text>

I’m taking the time to write this review because this body shop did an awesome job with my BMW.  I’ve never seen so much good detail done to a car.  The bottom line you want to get your car done right take your car to Diamond Auto Body.... 5 star service!

I wanna give a special thanks to Mary,  really showed a lot of professionalism.

Thanks< /review>

My 4 year old son thought it would be a good idea to spray paint my husband's truck black. It was only a couple spots but it still was obvious. I took the truck to diamond and they had it fixed within 20min. Yiu cant tell there was ever black paint on it. Diamond auto body was polite, professional and knowledgeable. We will forever be customers of Diamond auto body and will continue to refer them to evwryone<//Text>

My daughter was driving my car. Got hit by an illegal alien and destroyed my right rear wheel assembly. No insurance of course. Took the car here and they did a pretty good job of fixing the door. However the right rear suspension wasn’t tightened properly. So spent more money to get it done right.<//Review>

< Review>
I'm very impressed!
I've been to a few places to get random repairs done to my vehicle and these guys did an amazing job and on top of that the price was really reasonable to fix my Subi.Thank you very much!!!
Also I'm pretty sure with as many careless drivers on the road now a days.You can bet I will bring my cars there every time.Thanks again Danny and your team!< /Review>

It is hard to find a company whom you can trust to give excellent service and will not cheat you. We have been fortunate enough to find Diamond Auto Body. My husband and I have gone to Diamond Auto Body for three separate occasions - once for a new windshield, and twice for auto body work. They have gone above and beyond, coordinating with the car rental company and the insurance company. Besides the excellent customer service we received there, the work on our vehicles was impeccable. We will not trust our vehicles to any other auto body company.

I must add - the three cars they have worked on are a 2001 Ford F150, a 2005 Scion XB, and a 2014 Toyota Rav 4 - all of which do not even total $75,000. I was still treated with the same respect as the people with the fancy cars.

I want to end with an observation that speaks to their customer service - the other day I saw an accident not too far away from the business. I saw one of the employees helping a gentleman push his car to the side of the street away from main traffic. I don't know too many companies who would do that, especially in the heat.<//review>

<user_name>Andrew Forbes<//user_name><Review>I took my car to Diamond Auto body after my brand new 2017 Audi was rear-ended on the Friant off-ramp of HWY 41.  After getting hit, I had a lot of bad feelings about getting the car repaired because the car was brand new, and I had felt that nobody would be able to fix it correctly. I was totally wrong. The guys at Diamond Auto Body had my car back to factory-looking conditions. After my car was repaired here, my dad had some body issues with his car and he went here. His car came out of the shop looking brand-new like nothing ever happened.
I would recommend these guys to anyone, and I will be bringing my car back here for any issues I have in the future. They get things done right the first time around.<//Review>< UserId.>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Waited 2 months to get my car in this shop to repair a scratch on my back bumper and trunk. Took a week and a half to get it done. Never called me to update on the progress. I finally walked in to find out the status of my car. Told they were still waiting on a part but would be done by 4:30. Here I sit at 4:55 waiting for them to finish "washing my car". And now my bill is $200 more than quoted. I'm really disappointed.< /text>< pictures>

My car was not ready when they said.  When they did tell me it was ready I went to pick it up and it wasn't.  When I first went in the receptionist couldn't find my appointment because she was looking at the wrong schedule and was rude to me.< /Review>

<Text>Dr D’Sylva is an amazing pediatrician. I moved far away and will still make the long drive just to go see her and make sure my son gets the best medical attention.
My son had gotten sick and she called several times within a week just to check up on us and see how we were doing. Office staff is very friendly, it’s always clean and they’re very attentive to everyone.< /Text>< pictures>

Been going to this doctor since I was born Anna I'm about to be 21. All the doctors and nurses there really get to know you and will actually listen.  Sometimes the wait is long during flu season but recently they've stepped it up really well and I'm normally in and out within 20 minutes. I love them!</review>

Dr D’Sylva is a wonderful doctor! She was the primary pediatrician for my newborn at the hospital right when she saw him she was concerned of his skin color requested lab work and called us the same night with results. She truly cares for her patients shes on top of patients care and will call you personally with lab work and concerns.<//text>

<Text>Dr. D'Sylva is a wonderful and caring person.  My son was born 33 weeks and 3lbs and Dr. D'Sylva was his first doctor.  Now my son is 17 years old and on Honors List and still sees her.  She is such a good doctor and I am very fortunate to have had her be my sons doctor.  I owe her a tremendous amount of  thanks for helping me raise my preemie.<//Text>< pics>

< Review>
I wanted to make a huge recommendation for Dr. D’Sylva! She has gone out of her way to care for our newborn son. Since day one she’s greeted him by name even as we passed by her in the hospital halls and has personally walked us into a private room each visit so that our son didn’t have to wait in the waiting room. They have always seen us within 15 minutes and have listened to our concerns. Dr. Jackson in her office found a heart murmur and Dr. D’Sylva personally called us on a Friday night at 8:30 pm to let us know the results so that we were not worrying all weekend. In addition, we had an emergency this morning and we called her cellphone at 1:30 am and she answered right away to help. As a new mom, this experience has been priceless and my husband and I are grateful that she was recommended to us!</Review>

<rating>3< /rating><review>The wait is ridiculous just to be seen for less than 10 minutes. They really need to stop over booking or do something about it. The ladies at the front desk are okay. Nearly every time I go I wait about an 1 hour total in the waiting room and in the back room sometimes an hour and 30 minutes. Just to have the doctor in the room for less then 10 minutes. She’s a great doctor but the wait is crazy.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>Dr D'Sylva is a great doctor and great person! As a mom, I couldn't be happier with the care she has given my kids; at the risk of sounding corny I say that I am grateful that our friend recommended her. I was sad to be leaving Kaiser because my kids had a great doctor there but Dr D'Sylva is even better!</text>< Date>

<review>Dr. D'Sylva has been my daughter's physician since she was born. Now she is treating my two grandchildren as well. I can't think of anyone better qualified to take care of your children. She returns phone calls promptly, is always available and has a special way with children. She enjoys being with the patients and treats the parents with respect. We don't even live in the Corona area anymore but make the long drive because she is that good!<//review>< date>

<review>My husband and I both used to go to Dr. D'Sylva when we were little and now we bring our two children. We actually drive from Perris just to take them to see her and her staff. She always makes time to squeeze them in for same day appointments, which is a life saver when you have a sick infant or child. She's definitely the best pediatrician in the inland empire!!!</review><Date>1457371638968</Date><user_name>Tabitha Trease<//user_name>< resp>

<review>I am currently a resident pediatrician and feel that my wanting to join pediatrics as a career is due to my being a patient of Dr. D'Sylva.  I remember my visits to this exact building, and always had a good experience, regardless of how sick I was or how old I was.  My niece and nephew went to her as well, and sometimes the wait time might be long for some, however it's only because she's good enough to garner lots of parent's respect, as well as her taking the time to stay in the room for more than 2 minutes.
In response to a review made by "Google User," 2 years ago below, the exam maneuver done to the uncircumcised penis is both common, typical, and appropriate for his age.  You don't force it open, but you do have to test it's re-tractability as well as the placement of the urethra to ensure the patient doesn't have hypospadias, which might be missed if still in diapers.  We pediatricians are still taught to do it to this day, for a variety of reasons, (also worth mentioning is to make sure that the foreskin isn't too taught and cutting off circulation.)  She did exactly what she should do, and myself and many of my colleagues do the same.
I promise this Dr. is knowledgeable, remembers your kids, and will take the time to explain herself and answer questions.  Go to this doctor :)</review>< username>

<review>Dr sylva is a very good doctor,
My son is autistic and she is very patient with him, believe me, no many doctors has that talent, I really don't care if I have to wait because the way she treat my son it's worth a lot for a mother, my son always fights for not been touched  and she always wait and check him gentle and takes her time to make sure my son will be ok.
Thanks Dr sylva:)

<review>Dr. D'Sylva has been my kids' pediatrician since the day after my daughter was born.  Due to some complications, my daughter had to be moved to a local hospital with NICU.  You don't know the horror of having someone come in to tell you that your newborn baby has to be taken from you.  At that moment, Dr. D'Sylva was the doctor on call at the hospital and had been quietly monitoring our daughter until the moment she decided that my daughter's lungs were not clearing up as they should and needed to be moved to the NICU.  When she walked into our room, a close friend was visiting and recognized her immediately as she was her kids' pediatrician as well.  Knowing our friend approved, who doesn't easily give glowing reviews, approved of Dr. D'Sylva made us more at ease.  Even as she told us what was going on with our daughter, despite that initial feeling any parent would have, she was immediately putting us at ease.  My daughter spent a week in the NICU and Dr. D'Sylva constantly checked in on her despite the fact that we weren't officially her patient yet and were at another hospital.

Since then Dr. D'Sylva has been our pediatrician and we have been more than pleased.  Yes some times we have to wait longer than we want at her office, but what doctor's office is perfect.  She has a great way with kids and is able to calm them even when giving shots.  My kids simply adore her.  Never have I seen kids so happy to go to the doctor's office as mine but the moment we say Dr. D'Sylva they are excited.  She also returns our calls, even some of the dumb first time parent ones, promptly.

One last thing that I appreciate with Dr. D'Sylva is she gives us options.  To often doctors seem to try force you in one direction or another, but she has always given us pros and cons of any option faced before us.

If you searching for a pediatrician for your children, then I would highly recommend Dr. Yvonne D'Sylva.< /review><Time>1611063863710< /Time>< user_name>

Yvonne D'Sylva is an amazing woman! She dedicates her entire life to children. She was my pediatrician when I was a baby and now she is my daughters. The wait might be long and the building is old, but it is NOT dirty and she is well worth the wait! There are toys in the waiting room for children, so I don't know why a previous review said there wasn't? Maybe they don't have toys in the separate sick child waiting room... Im pretty sure we can all figure out why there wouldn't be toys in a room for contagious children to play with. She sings to your child and looks them in the eye, gets on their level. Anytime my daughter has shots she will cry while getting them, but as soon as Dr. is done she stops crying (probably because she is singing to her). She has been there when I had to call in the middle of the night. I trust her judgement and advice 100% I cant say enough about how much I love Dr. D'Sylva!< /text>

<text>I've been seeing dr d'sylva since I was a baby when she first started her practice. My mom always took me and my sisters to her cause she liked her so much. And now I have a baby and I take him to her! She remembers me and my sisters, and just genuinly cares about every patient she see's. She will answer your call at anytime and do anything to help. Only bad thing is that it's always a long wait to see her...

(Translated by Google) I loved this place, they treated me very well if you do not speak English well, the doctor asks for help to translate to her assistants that she has in the clinic! The doctor looked at my son and gave me the peace of mind that I wanted that nothing was wrong with my baby! I recommend this place all very clean the service in the shown well all the girls very nice!

Este lugar me encanto me trataron muy bien sino hablas bien el idioma inglés la doctora pide ayuda a traducir a sus asistentes que tiene en la clínica! La doctora miró a mi hijo y me dio la tranquilidad que yo quería de que no pasaba nada con mi bebé! Recomiendo este lugar todo muy limpio el servicio en el mostrado bien todas las chicas muy agradable!<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The doctor is always in a rush and does not take the time to check on the baby.

Phenomenal experience! Staff is killer and has helped get me on my feet, creating lasting connections even after graduation; best clinical team I have had the pleasure of getting to know! Not only addressed chemical dependency, but also created a greater understanding of mental health and skills to combat and maintain. The structure was much needed for me, setting me up for success in future endeavors as well! Great area for meetings, which a lot of residents as well as staff attend together. So much more I could say about the fruits of their program, so just do it!</review>

The shoreline living situations are the best Jin the business! Great homes, great house managers and awesome overall management! I loved my time here as a patient and can never replace the wealth of knowledge, tools and overall love I received here. My sober journey would not be what it is today without the connections I made in with patients and house managers in this particular sober living. If you any to get clean I highly suggest living within the community and getting the most of  what’s being there 24/7 has to offer. When I first signed up I was planning on living at home and commuting but I’m so happy I was convinced to stay in one of the homes. Thank you shoreline for the new life you helped me cultivate. Couldn’t be happier with the results here!< /Text>

<review>I have struggled to stay sober for a few years now and once landed at Shoreline Sober Living, the quality of this place is unparalleled. If you want to change your life and be held accountable to a world class standard of living, this is it. Residents of Shoreline not only stop the use of drugs and alcohol, they become successful and honest people. 5 stars does not do this place and the culture it facilitates justice.</review><UserId.>100194385474119316209< /UserId.></record>

They also teach you accountability, communication skills, life skills, nutrition classes, basically how to grow up, start being a man, and useful part of society. The things I am learning on a daily basis is setting me up for success in life as well as my sobriety. They have truly saved my life & showed me what it is to be apart of a family & how to have fun & start living my life to the fullest again. I owe so much to their program & staff which I could never repay but will try to by taking what I have learned there & pay it forward.</Review>< pics>

The Soberliving that shoreline offers was crucial for me in my early recovery. It is incomparable to any other Soberliving that I know of. The connections I formed while living there and the sense of accountability  that was instilled in me have truly changed me and my thoughts on being able to live a sober life.< /review>

Shoreline sober living is by far the best choice I made while doing the program. It’s very structured and has accountability. I learned what it meant to be a normal contributing member of society. I was surrounded by likeminded individuals who were also dealing with the same struggles as I was, which made it easier to share and open up to. The house managers were there for me at all times and had my best interest. I recommend anybody going to shoreline recovery, to go to their sober living as well. It was definitely a positive experience for me!</review>

Shorline is a great sober living and IOP program.  I’ve been to a couple different sober livings and Shorline out does them all. The structure and the accountability from all of the staff is what has helped keep me clean and sober. They truly care about every individual that wants to change there life for the better. If your looking for a new way of life along with a real Brotherhood then this is the program to be in.<//Review>

Good experience overall.  House managers can be difficult sometimes. But when are things ever easy.  Talk to John Menz.  He was super helpful and understanding of my needs.  Great place overall.

My son, Taylor, has been living in the Shoreline Sober Living house on Gardena Road for the last 6 months while he has been a client at Shoreline Recovery Center.  He graduated this week from Shoreline and  has moved to another sober living house in Del Mar.  Enough good cannot be said about the house managers, Mike and Shane.  When Taylor arrived at the house, he was continuing his detox and they both were attentive and focused on his immediate needs.  They set some pretty high expectation for  their clients, but not beyond their reach.  They take a personal interest in making sure that your son is getting what is required for his success. Then to top it all off, Mike and Shane, call the parents on Sundays to update them on the progress their son is making. The program teaches the guys how to work together to achieve a higher purpose.  Their program is very structured, but required to teach responsibility and develop respect for others.  Overall, Taylor said it was the best thing that could have happened to him.
Thanks, Mike and Shane for being there for Taylor when he needed you the most.<//text>

This was exactly what I needed to help guarantee my sobriety, the guidelines, and rules of the house were tough at times, but that is what you need to face in recovery to be successful in life afterwards, my house managers worked with me on everything being I was a different case than most but they made it work.  They keep a house like a family, everyone looks out for each other and tries to help the new guys learn the ropes!< /text>

<gmapID>0x80dc0c127ecefc93:0x77b2cd59dc85c6f9</gmapID><Review>I could write a long review about all the amazing people at shoreline. I could go on and on about the beautiful homes and their perpetual state of cleanliness. I could talk about the structure and how necessary it was to my recovery. Instead I’ll just say that Shoreline not only kept me clean and sober, they taught me how to stay sober. Its hard for me to express how grateful I am for that opportunity. The people here genuinely want the best for you and will do everything they can to help. I just hope I can help the next guy.

It isn’t easy, but it’s exactly what I needed and I am so very thankful for that. Just keep moving, it gets easier every day.</Review>< response>

If you’re ready for sobriety, this is the place. Honestly it was the most pivotal 8 months of my life up to this point. They treat more than just the substance and are in one of the greatest recovering communities in the country. I can live again, I can be with my family again, thanks to the work this place helps you put in.<//Text>

<Review>Shoreline sober living is excellent in balancing the need to provide structure and tailor to the specifics of their clients needs.  It is run in tandem with the recovery center, and the sober living component is essential for clients to build accountability and consistency in their daily behaviors.

All the houses are incredibly clean, and they are centrally located in a flourishing sober community that has dozens of weekly meetings.  Additionally the surrounding community of Encinitas was crucial to my recovery, providing opportunities for critical self care activities such as meditation, yoga, surfing, hiking, and rock climbing.</Review>< time>

This place saved my life!!
I was living in the back of my van and couldn’t stop drinking and gambling.
The staff is courteous, caring and devoted to helping addicts who are down and out. I spent three months there and learned so much about myself.
My house managers Ryan Ward and Noble White taught me how to be kind patient and discipline myself to a become the man that I am today. I went through the steps and and got my confidence back.
Today I have a relationship with both of my daughters and I reconnected with my oldest daughter who I hadn’t seen or spoken to in over six years.
I could never repay this debt and Shoreline was the last saving grace for me.
Anyone who has a drug, alcohol and gambling problem should definitely give Craig or Robert a call.
The program director Kate is amazing also. She got me through some of the toughest times in my life with therapy and never judged me.
This isn’t just a recovery center. They are my extended family and even though I live 2 hours away I still drive down to see my brothers on occasion.
Thank you Shoreline for giving me back my life!</review>

I've had the pleasure of being best friends with many of the young men that have gone through Shoreline's Program & Sober Living. It's no coincidence that I found such a solid group of guys to be friends with and they all were taught the principles of recovery and life itself from Shoreline. Each of them have flourished into trustworthy, kind, respectable men that are prime examples of what anyone can have in sobriety if they are willing and take the next indicated step. I can honestly say that Shoreline has provided each of them with the tools in order to not only stay sober and handle life on life's terms, but to succeed at it. Shoreline is a huge advocate for learning how to get acquainted in the recovery community, manage finances, build a strong sober network, have a job, work on relationships, etc. I would highly recommend Shoreline to anyone in need of guidance, structure, and accountability in recovery!< /review>

Shoreline Sober Living a quality place to start the journey of Recovery.  The owner provides a very comfortable and appealing atmosphere.  He upholds to the standards of the San Diego Sober Living Coalition and since the homes inception has thrived based on his stellar reputation.  He has helped me build my business and we have been fortunate to chat about Sober Livings and our programs.  His home is located in a fabulous neighborhood where meetings and Recovery events are within close proximity.  I have seen him go above and beyond with creating his own Sober events, so that his residents can learn that sobriety can be fun and you can make new friends along the way.  I respect Robert and hold him in high regard.  Bother personally and professionally.</text>

Shoreline sober living  provided me with the tools I needed to stay sober after I got out of rehab. I didn't know how to live my life sober and they provided me with everything I needed to succeed and be able to live a normal lifestyle. They've helped out many people and are serious about getting you the help you need if you're willing to put in the work it takes to stay sober. Going past 2 and a half years clean and I'm still grateful for the experience that I've been given from all the people who manage as well as live there.< /review>

I would like to write a little bit about my experience at Shoreline Sober Living San Diego. From the moment that I walked into this sober living home I felt comfortable and at peace. The home smelled good and was clean unlike any home I have seen before. I have lived in several sober homes in San Diego but none like this one. The guys that live here are caring towards one another and treat each other respectfully. What I also really loved about this home was the structure to the home that each of the residents participates in. I feel blessed to have been able to spend as much time with these guys at this home and they really helped me in my recovery. I am coming up on two years of continuous sobriety now.< /text>

<Review>Wow. There is so much to say about Shoreline Sober Living. The location and quality of the houses speak for them selves but what happens inside the house is priceless. Not only are they welcoming but as a new guy, you are the top priority of the house. Getting you accustomed to the way the house runs and into the sober community. The structure can be hard at first, but absolutely necessary for success. The comraderi and brotherly love that this place influences is something you can't find anywhere else. Shoreline sober living is apart from other places because they guide you to become a man. A man of his word, a friend, a leader. This place gave me so much I could talk about it forever. I've tried to get sober over and over the last 9 years, but it wasn't until shoreline was when I was given the tools and direction to succeed. I spent 14 months there and am grateful for every second. This place changed my life, saved it as a matter of fact, and for that I'm truly grateful. I would recommend this place to anyone!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<review>Shoreline was hands down the best decision I made when beginning the process of recovery. All of the staff were friendly,  relatable, and professional. Shoreline's comprehensive plan was exactly what I needed to regain the trust of my family and friends as well as it taught me how to live as an independent adult. Cannot speak highly enough of this place. Robert (owner) continued to follow up with my parents and myself to see how I was doing even when (at the time) it wasn't looking like I was even going to attend their program. Speaks volumes to how much they really care.</review><Response>None<//Response>< userid>

Words cannot express the gratitude I have for Shoreline Sober Living for helping my nephew end his addiction and maintain his sobriety. They helped him mature and become the successful man he is today. The staff was helpful and communication with the family was excellent!

<review>The location is beautiful, close to the beach and in a great recovery community. The owner and operator is serious about recovery.  He wants to give each of the guys who come to Shoreline the best opportunity for a new life. I have been around the sober living community for four years now and have worked with other homes as well. I can say that this is one of the best. This assessment is based on location, cleanliness of the home, heart of the owner and the program provided. I fully back this sober living.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>Shoreline changed my life forever and I am grateful to be a part of such a close fellowship & structured program. If something inside is telling you that you need help, then definitely consider Shoreline. Their staff is comprised of addicts/alcoholics just like yourself whose goal is to pave you a road to freedom and happiness. Just be mindful that there are rules, chores, and guides lines to follow— but I’ll tell you what, all of those things shaped me to be a better human being in the end.<//review><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Shoreline was exactly what I needed at a very pivotal time if my life. My addiction had driven me to the end of my wits and stolen everything from my life. The staff here is amazing everyone from kate down to the house managers will not give up on you no matter how bad you want to give up on your self. This program didnt give me my life back it gave me a life I love today. The men i lived with are my brothers today and the peer accountability this program has works you cant fly under the radar here this program is for people who want it and if you want it oh my god man is it worth it. I was a broke. Scared and lost little bit when I came to shoreline but after the 6 months I spent working on myself with their help I became a man I owe my life to this program and would highly recommend it.</text>

It worked in synchronization with its namesake Shoreline Recovery Center - with the leaders of the sober living coordinating, meeting with and sharing with the counselors, therapist and experts at the recovery center to offer each person the kind of well planned strategy for recovery.  The fellowship of the sober living residents is the stuff of deep long lasting relationships.  The managers have all completed the program.  They know what is needed to change someone who is entitled, disillusioned or depressed with their life and require action of their residents to effect such change.  As far as I’m concerned they’ve got the perfect model of what can work when someone is ready.</text><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Shoreline Sober Living was the perfect transition from the 30 day treatment center for our son, it was the answer to our prayers.  The house is run with a very regimented daily routine to keep all clients on track and give them the best chance for success in recovery, treating the mind, body and soul.  Our son has been sober for almost two years now and has been very successful in all aspects of life and employment. None of us knows what the future brings but we are very confident our son has the knowledge and skills to stay on the path he is choosing and where to turn when in need for strength.  He is taking it on day at a time and responsible for himself. For our family we couldn't ask for anything more and Shoreline Sober Living was
absolutely a key piece to puzzle of putting a life back together.  We again thank and ask God to bless Robert and the staff at Shoreline Living.<//Text>< pics>

<time>1483846400409</time><Text>As we write this review of Shoreline Sober Living, our son, just this past week, celebrated his first year of sobriety.  This milestone was achieved through a combination of hard work, commitment and courage that was fostered by the unwavering support of Shoreline's management team.  Over the course of the past year, we've had weekly communication with the house manager that served as a much needed bridge to our son and his progress.  The unfamiliar territory of his recovery was made far less daunting by Shoreline's expertise, compassion and desire to support the entire family unit.  We are eternally grateful for all they have done for us and continue to do for others.  It is an honor and a privilege to write this review on behalf of Robert Wilson and Aaron Harmon.< /Text>< name>

Shoreline helped me save my life. I could not get or stay sober. I have been to 10 different sober livings across 4 different states and Shoreline is on a whole other level. I was encouraged to take action and take responsibility for my life in a safe space. They helped me tackle the long standing problems my drug addiction caused. Issues with old behavior, finances, relationships... all were addressed with the help of peer accountability and mentorship of management. I met sober life long friends here. Everyone involved with this program just wants to see people get better. I am finally able to live my life, and this place helped me lay the foundation.</review>

I am a former resident at shoreline sober living and I have to say that it absolutely was the most vital element of my recovery and treatment. The support and fellowship that I found at Shoreline was overwhelming and has helped me build strong friendships that I still have to this day. Ultimately I was a completely renovated person after my stay at shoreline due to the serene atmosphere and level of accountability I was encouraged to apply to my day to day living. Plus being in the San Diego area provides beautiful weather all year long and leaves little for one to complain about. All in all Shoreline sober living provided me with the guidance, hope, resources and strength that I needed to build a new and happier life that I still enjoy today!</Text>

I own and operate a nearby intensive outpatient treatment program called True North Recovery Services.  One the years as an outpatient provider you get to know what other entities are doing through a pretty diverse sampling of their clients.  We have often shared clients with Rob and the staff at Shoreline.

Rob runs a tight ship at Shoreline and maintains a steady structure that everyone can grow familiar with.  We find that the safety of this also helps these clients in their therapy.  Sometimes they need to test the structure in order to feel safe.  Once they do they are magically able to open up in their therapy sessions.  They just needed a safe container to live in where they had support, accountability, and camaraderie.  Rob and the crew at Shoreline are doing an excellent job of providing this to all of them.  We hope they continue to do this for many years to come.< /Text>

Having a family member go through the program, Shoreline Sober Living is a great place for individuals that are starting their journey to recovery and are committed to their sobriety. Shoreline provides structure that encourages growth and promotes not only accountability for oneself but for others. I am thoroughly amazed and beyond happy the impact it has had on my brother’s journey to recovery and not only thankful but proud to say that he just celebrated his 1 year of sobriety. Shoreline has had a wonderful impact not only on my brother’s life but also our family.</review>

Shoreline provided an excellent environment that helped me to establish myself in early recovery.  After attending an in-patient facility on the east coast, I was told about Shoreline and contacted the owner Robert.  He was super helpful, worked with my family, and arranged for me to enter their program the day following my discharge from treatment.  Shoreline operates two beautiful houses near the heart of Encinitas and the management, headed by Robert and house managers Andy and Aaron, work hard to cultivate a positive living situation that encourages accountability, service, and progress -- all important factors in early recovery.  Shoreline creates a very healthy balance of freedom and responsibility that allows the residents to create a solid foundation for their recovery while establishing themselves as independent and functioning members of society.  Their location just north of San Diego is in the middle of a large, vibrant, and active recovery community.  I recently celebrated one year of sobriety and my time spent at Shoreline was instrumental to getting where I am today and hope to go in the future.  I would highly recommend Shoreline to anyone in need of a positive, healthy environment in which to forge their new lives in recovery.  Many, many thanks to Robert, Aaron, and Andy  --  you guys are the best!< /review>

This sober living home is top notch. Our son has been in others but it wasn't until he found Shoreline that he began to have success in his recovery. They know what they are doing at this home. The guidance and support are genuine. I can't say enough about Shoreline ... Probably saved my son's life. Aaron and Robert have our family's undying appreciation for the care, concern and tools they have provided our son.< /Text>

I've struggled with drug and alcohol addiction most of my life. I didn't know why, I just knew I could not stop no matter how hard I tried. When i moved to San diego for treatment it was the farthest thing I knew from home. The day i checked into Shoreline Sober Living San Diego I immediately felt at peace, no longer homesick. This home gave me access to and outlined for me a program of recovery that for the first time in my life allowed me to get and stay sober. Along with being sober came happiness. Happiness and sobriety, two things I never thought possible at the same time. Shoreline Sober Living San Diego provided for me structure and accountability that I've never received anywhere else. After many years of searching I was finally provided an answer which was shown to me in the twelve steps of alcoholics anonymous. For the first time in my life I feel free, happy and content with just being me. I cannot say enough good things about this place. It literally saved my life.< /Text>

Beautiful home. Amazing location on the coast of Encinitas. This area has a great sober community and living here is an awesome place for anyone looking for a lifestyle change. Definitely not you're average sober house, this place has all the amenities. Truly an opportunity of a lifetime for people new in recovery. From the owner to the managers these guys know what they are doing! They really care about the people in the house and the community. Sobriety can be be a challenge and having the structure and support of a house like this makes it that much easier. I have a lot of experience's with halfway homes, extended care and sober living and this place is top of the line in all aspects, which in my opinion is few and far between. Being surrounded by like minded people as well as receiving support from people in recovery is key to getting back on your feet and I can't think of a better place to do it.<//Text>

<text>These guys are really passionate about helping others further their recovery.  I have visited many different San Diego sober living homes as I have a loved one that has been struggling for many years.  This sober living home is unlike all of the others we have visited.  The managers here offer structure and accountability for these men and are very compassionate.  I'm so glad we found Shoreline Sober Living.< /text><user_name>Amanda Rodd (Arodd)< /user_name>< pics>

<Review>So a quick review on my experience at Shoreline Sober Living in Beautiful San Diego, California.  I lived at Shoreline Sober Living for a total of 14 months.  In that time period I learned a lot about myself and how to live life sober and as a functional member of society.  Without Shoreline Sober Living my recovery would not have been possible.  When I came to Shoreline Sober Living from New Jersey I had no idea what I was getting myself into, not knowing a single person in San Diego. Shoreline introduced me to an amazing recovery support system. Without this support system I would likely be dead or homeless.  I am forever grateful for every experience that has taken place during those 14 months.  Even after moving out of Shoreline Sober Living I return frequently to see all the guys and update them on how I am doing.  I now work two jobs, see my son on a regular basis, my family wants me around again, and I am the happiest most productive person I can be. Once again none of what I just mentioned would have been possible without the guidance and love that I received  from Shoreline Sober Living.  I would recommend this house to anyone who seriously wants to get sober.</Review>< response>

I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful setting to get sober in!  Shoreline Sober Living is located in the perfect location in San Diego County-Encinitas.  Fortunately, for every guy that decides to give this sober living a shot, Shoreline offers so much more that just beautiful location and beautiful houses.

The structure of the program has been designed to give men like me the tools to stand on our own and transition back into life.  I learned a lot about accountability, responsibility, and brotherhood in my time living there.  The environment promotes building strength from within and building community and connection between guys.

Paired with IOP at Shoreline Treatment Center, the model is unlike any other that I have experienced.  The structure was much needed in my life but didn't take away from learning how to have fun again, either.  The reputation for being one of the best sober living programs in the area, if not the best, is well deserved.  I'm living proof, along with all the other alumni of the program, of the powerful healing that happens here.<//Text>

<Review>Shoreline Sober Living is the reason my son is sober and has been sober for the last 3 years. It is a very safe and supportive environment where the focus is on recovery.  And after talking with Rob, I felt comfortable in sending my son 3,000 miles from home.  Shoreline Sober Living has given our family back our son and I can't thank them enough.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I have worked in the sober living field for a few years now and the quality of this place is unparalleled. If you want to change your life and be held accountable to a world class standard of living, this is it. Residents of shoreline not only stop the use of drugs and alcohol, they become successful and honest people. 5 stars does not do this place and the culture they facilitate justice.<//Review>

Let me start by saying that this home and the program that these men run is truly bringing a breath of fresh air to the San Diego Sober Living community.  Shoreline Sober Living is much more than a place to live and be sober.  I was immediately able to tell that the management team at this facility is invested in making sure that each resident is given the best possible opportunity at achieving permanent sobriety. Having personally experienced three different treatment centers and two other sober living homes I can say Shoreline is a one of a kind.  Shoreline Sober Living provides superior amenities and structure that are a necessity to be successful in sobriety.  The spirit that this home contains is inexplicable and helps create relationships that will catapult you into a new and healthy support group and way of living.  When you have been to and visited as many sober living homes, treatment centers and outpatient programs as I have you can start to see the difference between ones that are run by those just looking to take your money and those that place the quality of the homes recovery first.  If you take the opportunity to come tour this sober living home and meet the community here you will see how genuinely caring these men are.  I was able to easily walk to the beach and the gym from this sober living home and they provided surfboards for residents and did outings like camping trips, ping pong tournaments, paintballing, snowboarding and fishing.  What kind of sober living home does that!?!?  The home is brand new and really big and it is always spotless clean.  All of the men attend daily 12 step meetings and the most important part is that they attend TOGETHER.  Anyone that has attempted sobriety knows that you can't do this alone.  I have seen so many struggling men come through this home and achieve long term sobriety that I wouldn't recommend anywhere else. Thank you to Shoreline Sober Living and those who run it!<//text>

Shoreline provided me an ideal environment to heal and then the motivation to thrive. The program is centered around community, and personal growth; they take things a step further and help their clients become financially responsible and explore ways to achieve their passions in a healthy way.

I have yet to meet a person whose desire to help those struggling with addiction is more passionate than Robert Wilson's (owner & CEO). When faced with the choice between what is best for a client and money, there is never a hesitation... people are always first. This is the primary reason I chose Shoreline. I view my time at Shoreline as one of the most valuable and enjoyable experiences of my life. If you want real change, this is the place to find it.< /review>

I had an opportunity to meet some of the staff of this men's sober living at a networking event and it was a breath of fresh air to meet people as passionate about their line of work as I am. As a yoga instructor I deeply care about the health and well being of all of my clients and it is obvious  that the staff at this sober living whole heartedly cares about the improvement of their clients quality of life as well. For anyone considering this house as an option  I highly encourage you to reach out to them and you will see for yourself that their number one goal is to help others. The beautiful location and like minded community doesn't hurt either.< /Text>

Shoreline sober living provided me the guidance, support and structure I needed in early recovery.  After completing treatment, my counselors strongly advised that I attend Shoreline sober living.  Now, after several years of sobriety, I am grateful that I followed that recommendation. My time at Shoreline was the single greatest contributing factor in my path to becoming a highly productive, sober member of society.  I now work in recovery as counselor, which has given me an insider’s perspective on how Shoreline compares to other sober living programs, and as a result, my appreciation for this program has only grown. The structure of Shoreline’s program is not like any other you will find in the area. What separates Shoreline from other homes is the culture of comradery, and even more importantly, the level of accountability. Upon entering Shoreline I was accepted with open arms and the residents integrated me into the community quickly- showing me the ins and outs of the daily routines, the best meetings to attend and setting me up with a solid sponsor.  I was also introduced by my fellow residents to many people in the recovery community outside of Shoreline that I now consider friends. I saw this process repeated with each new resident.  Looking back now, I realize how imperative this experience was to my recovery.  Finding and becoming part of a sober community is of paramount importance and Shoreline facilitates this experience in a way that other recovery homes don’t. Aaron, the Program Manager, does a great job of fostering a positive atmosphere while stressing the importance of a balanced life that includes work, fellowship, commitment, goal setting, financial responsibility and community.  The entire staff, from the top down, genuinely care about helping each resident find success in sobriety and they work closely with each resident to assist in the transition from treatment back into the stream of life. Shoreline’s location couldn’t be better since Encinitas is home to an active, robust recovery community.  The houses are centrally located and close to the beach. There is plenty of opportunity for employment in the surrounding area and the houses are walking distance to the gym and shopping centers.  The houses themselves are immaculate and kept clean. I am eternally grateful for the experience I received at Shoreline, and highly recommend this program to anyone looking to find lasting recovery.<//Text>

I just wanted to say I'm super grateful for this recovery home for helping out so many struggling young men. Opiate addiction destroys lives and literally kills 150 Americans every day. My ex boy friend had been struggling for years with meth and heroine and is a chronic relapser who's ego would not let him gain the social skills and work ethic he needed to keep healthy relationships and a job. This recovery home gives men like my ex the opportunity to integrate into society with confidence they need to know they don't need to rely on drugs and ego to keep them afloat. At shoreline the residents become actively involved in a recovery program while they learn to work through personal issues keeping them from maturing and participating in the community. I'm so grateful for the folks at shoreline for their wonderful sweet care and vast experience with addicts of all ages. Thank you.</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Our son is in his third year of recovery.  We attribute much of his success in now being free from not only drugs but also alcohol and tobacco to the support, care and guidance he received at Shoreline and from its management team. Following a lengthy, 120 day stay at a local San Diego County inpatient treatment facility, he stayed at Shoreline for over a year and since then has maintained contact with the community.  Throughout his stay we were most appreciative of Shoreline's continual weekly progress calls, advice, expertise on addiction and desire to help not only our son, but also all of our family navigate the difficulties that arise throughout the different stages of getting free of intoxicating substances. During his three prior unsuccessful attempts to become free of drug use at nationally known inpatient treatment centers, we never fully understood, nor was there much attempt made by those facilities to make us aware of the critical role a sober living facility and ongoing outpatient treatment provides in achieving lasting recovery. Thirty days of inpatient treatment followed by nothing more than AA meetings and good intentions was a recipe for relapse. During his last in-patient recovery at a well known facility here in San Diego County, they stressed both the need for at least 90 days of in-patient treatment and for an extended period of transition with outpatient treatment while living in a structured sober living facility where continued sobriety is bolstered through ongoing testing, experienced staff and and a community of peers who are also seeking lasting recovery.  Shoreline Sober Living is such a facility. We are extremely grateful for all they have done for our son and us.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

My best friend was a hope to die drug addict. We all feared for his life and watched him live homeless and miserable for years. After finding about shoreline sober living we got him in. He now has turned his life over and his family is back in his life. Now every Sunday we see him at church and are so thankful that God has put a place where addicts and alcoholics can have a new chance at life.</Review>

Shoreline Sober Living is a great place for people to start their journey in recovery. Working for a local treatment center we are constantly referring our residents to Shoreline knowing that they will get quality care with a supportive and experienced staff.< /Text>

<Text>As a former client of Shoreline Sober Living, I was very pleased with going through the program and interacting with the staff. During my active addiction, life was falling apart at every seam and filled with negativity, doubt, hatred. The awesome part of the Shoreline program was that once I got sober, I learned how to live sober. I was taught how to take care of things like chores, keeping my possessions organized, being accountable to not only myself, but people around, and building trustworthy relationships. I learned how to take care of the little things so that when it was time for the big things, I wouldn't get overwhelmed and be prepared to handle whatever life throws my way.  Almost reaching a year clean and it's all thanks to this program. I would definitely recommend it anyone who is willing to do what it takes to get a better life and one that is full of happiness, positive energy, and purpose.< /Text>< Name>

Shoreline sober living is a men's house that varys in age. It is located in San Diego California. It is by far the best sober living in San Diego county due to their structure. I have a few close friends that went threw that house and they came out as completely different people. Why because they focus on alot of the uncomfortable things that us as alcoholics have to go threw in order to stay sober long term. That's the difference between shoreline sober living and all the other sober livings in San Diego,  accountability is a key factor there, it's so nice to see a place that actually cares about all the residents. They show up for them and there family's threw the hard difficult time. Its houses like this that make a tremendous difference in the world and in people's lives. THANK YOU!</Text>

<text>Its just an old bad spot to me with some negative  history and memories to it. @ crime, homeless, theft, assault, drunks, druggiez, street games, horror story. CPTSD. No security that I sa in or outside and the employees seemed to be just as afraid as some of the customers.</text>< Pictures>

Recommended beach! Large grain sand which is easy to clean off and great views. Even some tide pools.</review>

Beautiful location! Can't beat the views! The trail down to the beach is unpaved with many steps (not handicapped accessable), no railings, be careful with small children and elderly. Great place to hang out for the day, bring a lunch and maybe beach umbrella as there is no shade. Bathrooms are in the parking lot area and so are garbages. Clean up after yourselves to keep the beach trash free! Go during low tide to check out the tide pools, we saw a variety of sea life including two giant star fish!<//text>

Beautiful area. Easy access to the beach and trails north and south. During lowish tide you can walk to multiple beaches and be totally alone. Tide pools galore and lovely views from the trails.<//review>

<text>It's a bit smelly, rocky, and kelpy. Also, the trail down is a little treacherous. But the two random seals popping their heads up occasionally was a nice touch.

Nice, small beach. As the name implies, there is an abundance of shells which is swell. Look out for sea lions! Also, check out the trail by the parking lot before heading down to the beach; it’s an easy walk and well worth it.< /text>

There used to be more shells 10 years ago, but the tide pools are still worth a visit. This is a great place to show kids the beauty of the ocean!<//review>

Great beach, but it's 1 1/2 mile hike down stairs to get to the beach, and then 1 1/2 mile hike back up.<//Review>

Great secluded beach with lots of sand and rocks. Like all the beaches along here, you have to go down the stairs to get to the beach.</text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>Beautiful place for a  easywalk, great views of the ocean and hills. Teaming with wild life, watch for hawks,  ravens, crows, gulls, pelicans, and deer. Great spot for whale watching during migration and dont forget your picnic. NO DOGS on trails, I know you love your dogs but this is a Wildlife Protected trail, watched an unleashed dog run down a Fawn yesterday, lucklily the little deer got away. Keep your dog at home on in the car Please.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

< review>
Actually went to Target looking for printer ink. No one was in electronics to ask some questions of.

I did, however, purchase a new pair of swim trunks, leather wallet (radio chip scan proof), and a pair of crocs for the poolside.

Maybe I should look into a job there at Target, at least in electronics, I know I can do a better job there than whoever worked there...apparently no one.< /review>

Not too happy, Employees need to think of the customer, it seems like everytime I go to use the Mobility Scooters for shopping, there isn't any available or if there is one it always seems to be dead..
This place makes Millions of Dollars,
Would it hurt to spend 30K on (10) new mobility shopping Scooters per store..
If I was able to walk I would but I have 1 leg So..< /text>

I'm not really a Walmart fan but the Neighborhood Store has always had good visits to the point of lite consistent smiles, nods and small waves.  The staff is always shaping invo on shelves and constantly stocking goods.  But I get a good vibe in the air everytime.  One star off because they could afford to run two cashier's during non-peak times because rushes have little consistency...but I've never been stuck forever in line.</Review>

This is my least favorite hardware store in the area. The wait times for returns and checkout are usually very long. They usually don't have what I need and the staff is not very helpful. I dread everytime I have to visit this store.</Text>

Really big store with a huge selection from different cultures. Lots of fresh fruit, snacks, frozen selection, seafood, live fish, and 5 restaurants at the end to eat at.</Text>

<Text>Great outdoor mall. It has many options for gift shopping and places to eat. Shop here for fun or for necessities. Sometimes in the summer a mini carnival is set up across the street. A visit could be a fun family outing or a pleasant time for yourself.< /Text>< user_name>

Its sketchy at best, but with some good stores. Very vacant like the mall (Sunrise Mall) across the street, but more products for me to buy, then. Shrug. I saw some kids pull out of a parking space in the Best Buy area lot, hit another parked car, and take off. *shakes head.* Park away from other cars if yours if halfway decent. It's worth the walk.</Text>

There's so many different stores here. My only problem is the parking lot. Cars seem to go any way they want through the lot and on marked crossings.</review>

Best Buy staff are very helpful with product information and location in the store. Cell phone technicians assist very well with getting the phone you want and setting up your new phone transferring data from your old phone and answering tech questions.< /Review>

Eh. It's  the new Birdcage. I remember the old birdcage and miss it. There used to be a sense of culture. Now it's just a glorified strip mall.

So I guess if you want to go where the parking is a war, the people are fighting for their single minded aims, then drop on by. I did. This Michael's is the closest to me and I wanted to get a picture frame on sale.</Review>

I can't ever find anyone on the sales floor to help me!☹️ I always have to go to the customer service counter to get a question answered, it's annoying. Makes me not want to shop there anymore. The cashier's are friendly and knowledgeable. The store is clean and we'll stocked.</text>

Great place for what they offer but not as great as it was in the past, it needs more business opportunities that can restore it to the past glory of the 1970s.<//Text>

This was so cool to look back on all the different places and times we were there. So much has happened in a year. We are so blessed and love being around our loved ones. Buying a home and all my important peeps came down to help us clean and repair so awesome. Thank you to all for such a wonderful year.<//Review>

If you're looking for a quick place to stop, and you're in the area, this is the place. I have heard of people coming from Roseville to this area to shop here, and I have no idea why they would do that.< /Review>< pictures>

I've always been a big fan of the Birdcage Mall across the street from Sunrise Mall! I like the old school mall feel of Birdcage! I like how all the stores and shops are very nicely placed throughout the property! The property is huge, you'll never need to worry about running out of places to shop! Plenty of parking, nice sidewalks and the Starbucks on property makes this mall a keeper!</Text>

<text>It is a good outdoor mall that has experienced a positive transformation over the last few years.  With Walmart, Best Bey, Michael’s, Barnes and Noble, and Lowes being the major tenants, the development has a consistent flow of shoppers.  This marketplace will continue to grow as Sunrise Mall is rumored to be closing soon.<//text>< GmapID>

Looking around for something that I need for a half hour. I literally had to go to the customer service counter and ask for help when there were a dozen geeks on the floor. Every one of them too afraid of a grown ass man (with a cut on) to help him. Had I been a pencil neck geek,they all would have been on my heels. Then the manager couldn't show enough respect to walk back and tell me that they have to order the part. Just radioed the kids at the counter. Society has quickly developed in the direction of unaccountable cowards with no respect for anyone. If you raise your kids to be like this, don't wonder what happened or why they keep coming home with a black eye and a fat lip. Man up and teach your kids how to act like a respectable adult. Cause if you don't, I AM GOING TO.</Review>< Time>

Great shopping off Sunrise! Best Buy, Barnes & Noble, Wells Fargo, and many others are located here - no lack of things to do! Across the street from the Sunrise Mall. Definitely worth checking out if you are passing by.</Review>

I remember when there was actual averies (large birdcages) in the middle of the open air mall. That's why its still called Birdcage. They should bring that back. Nice shopping area. Some big box stores, lots of smaller shops, banks, food and snack places.</text>

<Text>The last strong shopping center in the heart of Citrus Heights.
Sunrise Mall is a depressing view across the way...  The barnes and noble is part toystore , part novelty shop, part starbucks, so thats probably helping it survive.

The coldstone smells sickeningly sweet and the Bath and Bodyworks smells super tasty...but thats just me.  I never shop at either. Theres and Ulta and Target that maintain the lion-share of the traffic on the southern side.
A seemingly unviable Old Navy next to a shuttered Sports authority.

DSW shoes is probably one of the next to go. I cant imagine them having to light, air condition, pay rent and payroll for all those shoes no one is looking at.
Always empty.

Best buy is pretty mediocre. Poor customer care.
Cost plus is a good stocking stuffer place in a horrible location. Handy if you need an 8oz measing cup i suppose. They do have some tasty, uncommon what-nots in the back of the store.
The Wal-Mart grocery store has nightime lighting issues in the parking lot, and is primarily boxed and frozen foods. The fesh food section is umdersized to say the least.</Text><time>1566091807050<//time><Rating>3<//Rating>< response>

<Review>It was Walmart.. the one at Birdcage. They never have what I'm looking for. It seems they are all getting rid of cashier's and having customers ring up their own item's. Wouldn't mind if I weren't disabled due to spine issues. Makes it very difficult ringing and bagging my own item's! I thought I'd try another Walmart as the one in Orangevale is a disaster in every way!!! Especially those who wear the yellow vests!! I'm referring to Orangevale Walmart!! Go in at your own risk!!!</Review>< Pics>

Went to best buy to return product. Was still brand new but the customer care rep opened it to test as if I tampered with it. I was insulated. Then wouldn't refund. Only store credit. Not giving this store chain my business anymore. I complained to corporate office. No help at all.<//Text>

I shop at the Home Wal-Mart. I was one of the first people to shop there.I loved it
Close by not a huge store, basically had what I needed. Today, rarely do I find what I need. It's not well stocked at all. The 3 stars and for the employees, always willing to help.</Review>

Tried picking up a 2nd online grocery order from Walmart because 1st time was fun and order was fine.  They messed up the order and i wasnt. happy. I gave them feedback but got no response. I'll give them a 3rd try which is make or break.  Hopefully it will be like the first order.  The one thing i like is once you've set your favorites list ordering is easier and faster. So online is fine.  It's the human filling your order where the problem lies.  The pick up customer service is very good.</text>

<text>This shopping center has changed a great deal over the years.  (Some for better, some for worse depending on who you are talking to.)  Overall has some good stores and the smaller stores within the center are usually not crowded.  Has been slowly taken over by larger "Box" stores in recent years.  (This is usually the reason for the "it's better, it's worse discussion).
I am one who is definitely nostalgic for the old days of the man made pond and stream with it's bridges and walk ways; but it needed the revitalization as the economy crashed and business vacated the buildings.  So I think the changes were good for the area even if the appeal of the area and unique walk ways and paths had to go.  (Old pond/stream and pedestrian only path was filled in and became a parking lot.)</text>< user>

The food is great, shops are busy, and the movie theater is HORRENDOUS.
Spare yourself the time and drive to Arden and pay a couple extra bucks to ENJOY your movie experience. I would never pay $4 for such an experience. The theater I was in was dirty, the seats smelled of dirt and sweat, and there was popcorn all over the floor.</Text>< Pictures>

It's not the Birdcage from my 80s childhood but in some ways it's better. There's plenty of variety for shopping and it doesn't get crowded like the mall. Except for today. But it is a Sunday 2 days before Christmas so it wasn't one of my more brilliant ideas to go shopping just because 🤷‍♀️ even so, it wasn't awful. But I cut it short and only went to Bath & Body Works. Which is another friendly place to shop I might add. Great outdoor mall, if you haven't been there you need to go!!</text>

<text>Plenty of variety to take care of whatever it is you need to buy. Always well kept and secure. Sometimes you have to park a bit further back if you're in a larger truck/SUV but it isn't too bad.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I really like some of the food. There are many good choices. The only problem is that it is a bit noisy.</Review>

Market Place in the early nineties was a thriving glorified strip mall across from Sunrise Mall. The mall has since lost its appeal being mostly a place you take your 15 year old to practice for their driving test. Market Place and the general area is transient now. I personally stop into the Walmart only in an emergency, the store is always freezing, and the employees are just awful. Customer service closes at 8:00 pm that means 7:00 to them. There is really nothing else I would go there for. It is as well abandoned so parking is never an issue. Best Buy, Michaels, Steinmart, Old Navy, Barns and Noble, Starbucks (isn't everyone sick of Starbucks), AAA, Jamba Juice, Famous Footwear, Cost Plus some scattered eatting establishments, banks, a red box and other stores. The way its laid out it really doesn't make any sense. A big parking lot with stores dropped in here and there. Boring<//Text>

Neighborhood spot that used to be the one but now it is where you'd go if you had to. It's got a Starbucks so theres that. Careful around the bookstore though it is a dangerous place. I got a book there once and the story never ended. Kinda weird but whatever I don't read much. Next thing I know I'm watching Netflix.</text>

There's so many storefronts. & then, they keep adding in more good ones. I come here for Target ULTA, Barnes & Noble, AAA, Jamba Juice... & more! It's very convenient to have so much variety close together. I come here quite often.</Review>

BUT, they do have some good stores, Old Navy (probably one of the better locations, and they are way bigger than the one in Roseville) Barnes n Nobles (if you still believe in physical books!) Toys R Us is just tore back over there. If you do decide to shop at this Toys R Us make sure you know half the stuff you are looking for is probably on the floor, I don't really ask for anything from there employees because they can be found, and the place is just dirty in general. They also have a Walgreens, a Home Depot, a few banks, etc.</Text>< Pictures>

Birdcage is a nice shopping center. Jamba wasn't too crowded. Probably because their prices have gone up. Over $5 for a small smoothie.</review>

<Review>They updated the whole place some years ago & better choices in stores & many places have outdoor seating. There's lot of parking & entrances/exits. I feel safe & I like the security walking around outside.
The only place I will not return to the Metro store, I've been here a few times, the employees are rude, not interested unless you are planning an upgrade.
One young guy tried to sell me a new SIM card for $10, he told me the one in the phone I was changing didn't work, he took old one out of his drawer & didn't think I noticed.  When I told him to put my old one back in it worked.. he laughed and looked at other guy behind counter!!</Review>< name>

This place has everything that a gentrified shopping center should. Barnes and Noble, Starbucks, Target, Neighborhood Walmart, Panda Express, you name it they have it.. or something close enough. We shop here often and are usually never left wanting.< /text>

Police everywhere. I don't know what the issue was but in order to get out of this place I had to take an alternate route. East, North or South and then back around to get back onto Greenback was the only way I was going to get back home.<//Review>

I love this little shopping area. It's open, inviting, and there's lots of options... Best Buy, Barnes & Noble with an attached Starbucks, my dentist is there, there's a target, Walmart neighborhood market, Ultra, Cold Stone Creamery, salons, Jamba Juice, Chipotle, Panda Express, Pink Berry... and so much more that I haven't mentioned.< /Text>

<Review>They updated the whole place some years ago & better choices in stores & many places have outdoor seating. There's lot of parking & entrances/exits. I feel safe & I like the security walking around outside.
The only place I will not return to the Metro store, I've been here a few times, the employees are rude, not interested unless you are planning an upgrade.
One young guy tried to sell me a new SIM card for $10, he told me the one in the phone I was changing didn't work, he took old one out of his drawer & didn't think I noticed.  When I told him to put my old one back in it worked.. he laughed and looked at other guy behind counter!!<//Review>< pictures>

It's a convenient place to find a variety of goods and services. It also has nice murals in the older area. Although there is allot of parking, traffic around that area is horrible.< /review>

What happened at Walmart today at Birdcage homeless guy stealing at Walmart he had his sweatshirt stuff. They're trying to stop him no one there to help him unfortunately when I pulled into the parking lot there was homeless but there's signs out asking for money laying on the lawn I think your security should do a better job I've been there many times homeless asking for money at the doors I go to Walmart lot to my neighborhood store right around the corner from my house I spent about $100 a week I don't like saying bad things about my community store they should have some better security<//Review>

<text>Apart from trying to drive thru this maze of a parking lot and getting stuck behind some person who is clueless about where theyre trying to go and refuse to pull over and out of the way but instead slowly ooze forth, making me want to do things sane, non-violent people DONT do!  Aside from that, the Best Buy pickup was without incident.  The girl at customer service was great!</text>< pictures>

<review>I went to the walmart market. It was ok. A fairly typical wal mart.  They didn't have as wide of a selection as a super center would. And the layout of the store was rather odd . I desperately tried to  find the cookie aisle to no avail.  After wandering aimlessly for what seemed like hours but was really maybe a minute or so, i decided to ask for help. Unlike Moses,  i asked a store associate for directions.  I approached the gentleman stocking the shelves and inquired as to where i could find my double stuff oreo family size package of cookies. He looked at me as tho i really *was* Moses and needed directions out of the desert. In other words, he  Didnt. Speak. English.
I am NOT an immigrant basher nor am i anti immigration. I am *however* a HUGE advocate of learning the language of the country that u not only live in but also work in.  Wal mart, if an associate doesn't have a minimum command of the English language, please do not place him or her in a public facing position.  Whomever wears that blue shirt and or vest becomes the face of wal mart. Not some high paid corpprate mogul.</review></record></dataset><record>

Can't believe they demolished such a awesome shopping center just to create this. What was wrong with the water features, bowling alley, and $1 movie theater? Now there's nowhere to go but the malls. BORing.< /Text>

Lots of stores but parking is always kind of cramped. Especially by Barnes and Noble or by Jamba Juice.<//Text>

The whole shipping mall can't be rated based on individual retailers and locations but as far as parking lots go it's great and has a sometimes frustrating but interesting layout.</review>
