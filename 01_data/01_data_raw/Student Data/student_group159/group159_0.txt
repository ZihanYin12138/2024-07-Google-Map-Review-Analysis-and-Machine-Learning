<Name>James Braxton< /Name><Date>1613659546879</Date><Rate>1< /Rate><review>***Avoid this place at all cost*** They are very unprofessional as they don't return calls or emails. There is no way to reach the Dr who is mediocre at best by email and when ask for him to call you back he never does. Dawn the office manager is a liar and manipulator. She is the worst manager ever can't believe she has a position where she is dealing with people's lives and could careless. I have been calling this place for over a month to schedule my yearly check up and no response, so once I noticed that I was dealing with people who don't believe in customer service I wanted to switch Drs. So I finally got Alex on the phone who is very incompetent, firm and mean. She told me to come in to there dirty office and fill out paperwork to get my records. So go to the office and fill out the paperwork and submit it to them. Dawn tells me it should be ready in about a week. They also had the nerve to try schedule my annual check up after I had been trying for a month to reach this office and no one answers the phone or returns emails. Of course they didn't get back to me so I called, left messages and emailed over 6 times. Finally talked to Dawn who lied and said this is the first I'm hearing about this. I then tell her you were there when I gave Alex the paperwork and told us that it would take 1 week here it is over a month hence the reason I want my records to find a real Dr. This place is a dump and the Dr is average at best. Please, Please Please don't go here because it's convenient go further out and get better treatment because these people are the worst in the medical industry.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Doctor and staff are very professional. I was desperate about an ear issue. I called to set an appointment and was given one the very next day! Appointment manager Dawn was very professional, polite, and listened to all my concerns and  was very detailed giving directions in how to arrive to the doctor's office. Dr. King was very attentive as I detailed my issues and took his time during the appointment. The desk assistants are also very polite and helpful. I was no more than hour inside the office. I cannot express my gratitude to all, they are a great team and really care for their patients.<//text></record>

<Text>Convenient location and Parking is s big deal for me and as patient at Dr King’s location, offered both. The staff was personable, yet  professional.  Dr King himself was professional and personable as well. Dr King asked key questions and made referrals based on my needs, as well as addressing my issues and concerns.

I have been hopeful for a doctor for sometime, who seemed to be genuinely concerned with my needs, as opposed to some other agenda.  Although this was my first appointment, I was very impressed, and that’s a good thing(first impressions).

Overall - Great staff, good vibes and most importantly, professionals.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>the service I received was great!! The wait was less than 15 minutes before I was taken to the exam room. The doctor was patient understanding and genuinely cared about my concerns and issues. He took his time to explain to me my options and about my medical problems. I didn't feel rushed or like I was just a dollar sign. I love having Dr. King as my doctor. He is smart and reminds me of how doctors used to be when you went to the doctor and you did not have to keep running back to get the medication that would take care of your problem the first time. I have been to several doctors that prescribed me medication that did not help me instead it actually caused more harm than good. I drive all the way from Downey, Ca to be treated by doctor king. I have known him for years and he is still a great doctor. Thank you Dr. King!</Review>< pictures>

Dr. King and his staff provide that personal touch that promotes ease during the visit. I sometimes get white coat anxiety, but Dr. King's gentle manner, calm voice, listening skills, and total focus on the patient he's face to face with, banishes all the anxiousness. I'm glad I was directed to him!<//Text>

Don't know where these good ratings came from but every person I've spoke to in that office hates the guy. He's a good doctor in the same way a Tsunami is a good way to water your lawn.

A very lovely place for both coffee and brunch ☕️🧇 The artistically designed and sunlit space has been attracting lots of the photo-takers. Meanwhile the food’s no less impressive (so this is not the usual pretty-but-not-tasty trap). The ube waffle could be ranked one of the best I’ve ever had - texture-wise ultra light and crispy, and the flavor of purple yam accompanied by maple syrup was just amazing (plus slicing it to uncover shiny purpleness inside was very pleasant as well). We also enjoyed the mango pesto rice - a great combination of appetizing and tangy mango salsa with satiating rice and sausage.</Text>

Nice young vibe inside the cafe. Has a contemporary design and architecture. Coffee and latte taste good. More on the expensive side. Seating arrangement for me is not comfortable inside the cafe. Great that they have outdoor settings.< /Text>

I cannot express how much I loved this shop. Everything from the decor to the coffee screamed relaxation. It was the perfect break from being stuck at home even though we were only there long enough to order and leave.<//review>

<Review>Laveta is a nice addition to this side of Echo Park. I got the chicken bowl which was so fresh and phenomenal and the coffee is excellent as well. It has outdoor seating and a small indoor space. I would more classify this as a brunch spot than a coffee shop though as the space isn't one you would want to stay in for long. The interior space is incredibly cool, but the seating doesn't have back support and the tables couldn't necessarily be used for a computer. The parking lot is also very tight and hard to maneuver. Overall though, a solid spot.< /Review>< pics>

Cute coffee house with unique caffeinated beverages. Pour overs, espresso, and matcha. Good food. Very cool minimalist interior design.< /Review>

Great food. Super atmosphere-we sat on the patio. Great service. The queso fundido with egg was amazing! The Rib eye was awesome and perfectly cooked. Beet and goat cheese salad was delish! Loved the coffee with sweetened condensed milk. Will definitely be back<//text>

My daughter and I visited Laveta for the first time Sunday. Honestly the cashier was not the most pleasant considering she was the main person interacting with customers. I changed my mind about ordering from there. My daughter decided to order and said her granola bowl was good. She's had better iced coffee.

Is not really the most comfortable seating for eating. Maybe if you're there just for a drink and chat. I wouldn't consider it for a place to do work or for a crowd. We more than likely won't return.<//Text>

<text>Laveta is given 5 stars for being outstanding in nearly every area
Menu, Interior, food, seating, service etc.

I recommend the MATCHA MISTO + LAVETA their signature.

Disclaimer: This is an authentic review and was not in trade for anything.*

Dear Laveta,
Thanks so much for the coffee on the house.
You are a 10/10.<//text><Name>Grace Davis< /Name><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

Out of touch with the community and set in a place that doesn't feel genuine. Overall the architecture screams GENTRIFICATION. I want to know exactly why does one neighborhood need so many coffee shops? and who is this cafe trying to cater to? because its definitely not for the locals.< /Text>

Great place for the price.

Most of the time it's great, but while I understand language barriers, sometimes the person picking up the call can be a bit rude... like don't get all annoyed just because you forgot to say where you're from when picking up calls and leave without a thank-you or something. We all have bad days and forget things, but even a quick "thank you" especially after placing the order isn't hard.< /Review>

The BBQ beef plate is awesome and tender, not chewy! I would always get the chicken plate but I’m switching. Get a side of macaroni salad. Trust me!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>This place never disappoints. The food is fresh and delicious. The portions are decent. The price is a little high, but the meals are shareable. They are also flexible with substitutions. The wait was an a little longer than usual, but I feel like that was due to the new safety precautions for COVID-19. Personally I would rather err on the side of caution and wait a little longer for my food. Especially when it's hot & delicious.</Review><user_id>106644189342627435134< /user_id>< name>

The food is great for the price. It is about 3 dollars less on average than major chain Hawaiian BBQ locations. The vegetables and macaroni do not taste as good as main chains but for the price difference I believe it is worth it.< /Review>

<Text>Our family has been coming here for years and it is consistent, comfort, good portion family food. The family pack is usually what we get (your choice of three meats, rice, Mac salad) and it is good amount for us (4 people) to have one hearty meal or a lighter meal with left overs.

COVID-19 precautions: they have tables set up outside, sneeze guards and hand sanitizer at the counter. Staff was wearing masks when I went as well as signs on the door requiring them for customers also.<//Text>< Pictures>

I've only tried their spam musubi, which was pretty good. The location could use an update, especially the faded menu signs.<//review>

Food is pretty decent for Hawaiian fast food in the OC.  You get a ton of food for your money as well. Cooked fresh to order, doesn't take long.  I really like that they have multiple Musubi options, not just Spam.  The Portuguese Sausage one is pretty good. Nice to have a choice.</text>

< review>
I'm a Hawaiian barbeque aficionado so I've been to them all at all different locations and the Chicken Katsu I was served was 3rd rate... Chicken and breading was overcooked which made it dry and the breading hard... Chicken Katsu is supposed to be tender "light" Chicken, this was dark, hard, chewy and dark meat. That's 1... 2- The pasta or (Mac salad) was nowhere near as tasty as other places I've been to. And 3- They served me less tasty BBQ ribs AND more of the less than tasty beef. It's a 3 item combo plate and 3+ things that were not up to par in the industry. Major fail. Too many delicious Hawaiian BBQ places to come back and roll the dice here. I'm a Hawaiian BBQ afficionado... not looking for just a "quick bite".<//review>

I chose this place solely because there wasn’t an L&L near me but I’m basing it 4 stars primarily on the food. It was worth the 30 minutes of wait time to get two plates. If you wanna try this place I would order in. They seem to put emphasis on takeout rather than serving customers in the restaurant. Other than that my suggestion of this place is really good food wise.</text>

I'm glad I came to this spot. The last time I went to a Hawaiian BBQ spot I was not impressed at all. Then I came here always wanting to try it, walking by it, and I finally did.
It was great. I'll definitely be coming back.< /Text>

My go-to is the Aloha BBQ Combo, and it comes with chicken, beef short rib, rice, macaroni salad, and steamed cabbage. They have a volcano sauce I like dredging meat through. Prices are fair and the portions are large. When feeding my family I buy the family meal, and it's more than enough food for 4, but could easily feed 6. Lastly, the staff here is very welcoming and does a great job keeping the condiment section well stocked and tables ready for guests.</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Generous portions and pretty authentic.  Our table had the short ribs, chicken and katsu chicken.  All very delicious, the katsu sauce was house made and complimented the chicken cutlet.  Authentic macaroni salad and sticky rice made for awesome sides.  Can't wait to go back and try their take on musubi.</Text>

<review>This place is worth it, for 10 bucks you get a nice plate with 2 servings of rice, some macaroni, and LOTS of meat, and some lettuce under it, they offer like 4 types of sauce from regular to spicy, and they’re all good, the family deal is also worth allot more, 30 bucks for 4 people, and one person won’t finish it. This place is one of my favorite places to take my family to eat. I highly recommend you get the plate instead of the bowl.</review>< pics>

<Review>I ate her with my son and daughter in law. It is fast, while till serving the quality of a sit-down restaurant. The chicken was tender the veggies crisp and the rice was perfectly cooked. The staff was friendly and professional. We were there just before closing but no one made us feel rushed at all. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good meal.<//Review><response>None<//response>< rate>

I hadn't eaten there in at least 10 yrs. I'd forgotten how good the food was. I ordered a seafood noodle soup that was delicious.  The serving was generous. The music was great. Nothing like listening to Hapa while eating.  Thought I was back on the Big Island.<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>It was a last minute decision to go here but im glad I choose to. The food here is delectable. Very spot on from the cooks. The prices arent bad either for how much you get(I usually finish all my food but I was pretty stuffed!).
Its a small place with friendly staff waiting to give you a "hello" with a warm smile. The menu is easy to read with a good amount of options. I recomend the BBQ mix(with 3 types of meat).

The one I got had very fresh rice, great macaroni salad, and tender, juice meats with lettuce at the bottom to absorb some of the residual meat flavors.

A great place for a quick lunch or dinner to take out and share with loved ones.
Highly recommend!</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Came here a couple of times because I work nearby. The food here is good, but it isn't the best Hawaiian food around. The kitchen staff and the establishment itself is quite small, so don't expect to get your food in time so try calling ahead or expect a wait.

Seating here is also extremely limited so make sure you can grab a seat in time. There is a couple of options for outdoor seating around the space near the restaurant.

I've came here a bunch of times enough to know the food here is good, but not excellent. I usually get the Chicken Combo which comes with Chicken Katsu, BBQ Chicken, Macoroni Salad, and some vegetables. Its perfect sometimes, but sometimes its either the Katsu or BBQ Chicken that may be disappointing. Sometimes when I am just looking for a snack, i grab a Spam Masubi and Macoroni Salad which never disappoints.

Customer Service here is also hit or miss. I've had okay experiences, and good experiences.</Review>< gmap_id>

<text>Ordered from here thru door dash for the first time. Got chicken katsu that taste like fish with no seasoning and garlic shrimp with no seasoning or garlic. Requested extra sauce they only put 1 in the bag. Horrible food on top of that food was cold. Never ordering from this place again.</text>< pics>

The family meal feeds 4 (5 small people) for about 30 dollars. You get to choose three main items (ex. pineapple chicken, teriyaki chicken, etc.) and get rice, macaroni salad, and steamed cabbage.<//Text>

Pleasantly surprised by this place since it's completely operated by Latinos! It's way better than the L&L in Renton, WA.

The beef & chicken bowl was perfectly sized & reasonably priced at $5.99. The "side" macaroni salad was only $2.50 & came in a small size Styrofoam container. It was massive & everything was onolicious!<//Review>

If you've been to one chain you've been to them all. The food is nothing remarkable, but I do appreciate that they steam their cabbages so they're actually edible; their sauces are also self serve so you don't have to beg for seconds (unfortunately I do see other people abusing that privilege). If you're looking for this style of food you can do a lot worse.< /Review>

The portions were pretty small compared to my first visit and I paid extra for more chicken and it's the same amount of chicken you get at normal price .. Not as good as it was rated ..  Way over rated.< /Text>

When we are ready for good Mexican food, this is our first choice. We normally get the order to-go, but today we got to safety eat inside. The staff is both friendly and dedicated to make sure you have a great experience.</review>

Prices do add up for a family of 5, but it's well worth it. Always a special treat for the family. Best authentic tacos in the area.< /text>

Great little restaurant hidden in the midst of the Canyon Plaza. The burrito I had (a chicken breast super burrito) was pretty on point and large enough to last me both lunch and dinner. Shrimp tacos looked delicious and fresh! And those California fries... oh so bad, but oh so good! Plenty of parking in the area and overall good feel/location. The service was also really nice and attentive, thanks!</Text>

We get food from this place a few times a month and we have never been disappointed. Great food and great pricing. I especially love their taquitos which is a meal unto itself. And they have a lovely assortment of tacos.</Review>

Taco had a lot of meat in it which was good but also not enough flavor. Food was delivered and I had asked for a side of the hot sauce and it was not included. Food seemed like it was Americanized. The carne asada was chopped so small at first I thought it was ground beef. There’s a lot of good little Mexican restaurants in the area. I don’t think I would order from this restaurant in the future.< /review>< time>

First of all they were open for takeout and outdoor dining(due to Covid-19).  Food was good, but service was a little slow.  Service was slow because they only had one person working the takeout and 4 tables outside.  Chicken Mole was delicious and the Burrito was huge.  It good Mexican food. Overall a nice experience during a difficult time.< /Text>

All her recommendations are spot on.  We have tried different dishes we never would have if it wasn’t for her and we love them all.  They even have the best hamburger I’ve ever tasted.  Hamburger in a Mexican restaurant!!
For those who are not too adventurous, you will love their grilled shrimp and fish tacos.  Price is very reasonable.  You even get discounted price on Taco Tuesday’s!!< /text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Good food.  I get the American burger because the beef is cooked in the same grill as their meats and it picks up that Carne asada flavor.<//Review>

STAY AWAY!! RIP OFF!! Having stoppef here many times on my way up to Napa, I've always considered it a great pit stop on the way home.

But, the attitude of some of the staff is so bad that I am compelled to write this review.  Just because you think I have money, and maybe I do.. maybe I don't, that doesn't mean I'm going to give it to you for something other restaurants include with the order.  Namely, hot sauce.  No, I am not paying you $3.00 for 1oz of hot sauce.  And, neither should anyone else.

I could go into more detail as to how I feel my race was a key indicator as to how far you thought you could go into my wallet.  But, I'll leave it to the reader to figure out what happened here.< /Review>

The food here is great! It's definitely a reasonable price, especially considering the prices of other restaurants in the area.  My favorite dish is the steak quesadilla. I've had it a few times and it's been exquisite every time. If the inside seating of the restaurant is busy, I would recommend sitting outside if you are able to. It can get quite loud when there are a lot of people inside.</Text>

I ordered the Alaskan salmon it was good however the salad was very weak what didn't look fresh and the dressing I couldn't figure out what kind it was perhaps I should have asked for the dressing on the side. Service was good they forgot to bring my water and silverware but when prompted it was very quick. Perhaps it was because I ordered at the pick up counter instead of sitting down I asked for hot water and got it immediately. The atmosphere it was okay I didn't like the flat chairs they weren't that comfortable.</text>

I frequent this place. Service is good, they have pastor my husband actually likes, and it's close to home. They have a kick-back atmosphere and there's seating options inside and out. Wonderful for a sunny day! So far, I'm happy with this place. Oh, and they serve breakfast all day!!!< /review>

<review>Used Doordash. Didn't know what to expect. OMG The chicken mole was out of this world. Large portion with yummy refried beans, rice and a delicious little side salad. The mole was similar to.Michoacan style: dark, sweet, and a bit spicy.  Muchosimas Gracias, Los Cantaros. Mi me gusta.</review>< Pics>

Visited recently with two adults, 4 kids. Everyone enjoyed their meal. I had the bean and cheese burrito with guac, sour cream, cheese added and it was very filling and tasty. My husband had a mini burrito special (which was a generous mini). We were very pleased that the chips served before  your meal are just right. Not many places provide excellent food and good, quality tortilla chips. Too often the chips are disappointing or the food is lacking. I'm very happy to have this restaurant near us! We'll definitely be back.....gonna try breakfast one of these days!<//Review>

Thumbs down on the Taquitos tho.  I see to order these frequently but idk what happened recently. They added cooked carrots to the mixture and gave you more carrots than beef or chicken. It was quite gross.</text>< time>

<Review>The service was slow and the tables outside were messy. Not very busy. The waitress needs more advice on how to wait tables efficiently and professionally.food was very good. I had the torta asada which was huge and hubby had a burrito with good flavoring og meat. Would visit again.</Review><Rate>3<//Rate><user_name>Sofia Calderon</user_name><user_id>111680791602278413963<//user_id>< Pics>

< Review>
The Chile Relleno is very good!!!! I also love the salads, soups, the food is consistently good, good salsa,good fruity watermelon and horchata , but.....The service although the servers are super nice, be prepared to wait..that improves it would be 5 stars..< /Review>

Food was delicious with large portions! Had the Tiajuana Ceasar Salad,2 tacos (1 chicken 1 beef), and  grilled chicken burrito. ...had to take the burrito home for later. And the waiter was friendly :)< /Review>

This place is a gem. We live in Vallejo but have yet to find a place that really satisfies us there. We tried Los Cantaros for the first time a few months ago, and now it is our go to. Everything is fresh, I love that the entrees come with a delicious salad on the side (with house made salad dressing that is amazing), they have a great selection of beers on tap, delicious agua frescas, plus a clean dining room with friendly service. I could eat just about anything as long as it was served in their Ranchero sauce!!! Thanks Los Cantaros!!!< /Text>

<Review>I love the food here. The Mexican style made carne asada tacos are my favorite. The chicken Mole is awesome and the Camaronea al Diablo are delish. Highly recommend. Prizes are good too< /Review>< user>

Always a pleasure. Super nice staff, lots of goodies. Not over priced like most small, independent convenience stores. Highly recommended!< /text>

< Review>
Stopped by here on a road trip, for drinks and snacks. Did not realize until we were on the road that the drinks, different brands, were both expired. One expired in Jan 2018 and one in July 2018. Cute store but they obviously do not inventory. highly recommend that you check dates before you purchase here.<//Review>

This store is very nice very clean however like one of the other reviewer said you probably should check the dates on your drinks. I'd say it's the best little store in carburetor County. LOL< /Text>

Pretty good food at a reasonable price. I like the idea of 1. Pick your meat. 2. Cook it. 3. Enjoy. The all you can eat comes with several sides. Side note: If you don't eat all of your meat there is an additional charge. Staff is kind and service is fast. This place stays busy, so if additional parking is needed there is some in the back. Bathrooms on premises.</Text>

<Review>I love this place! The menu is a bit different than before, however the food is always good. You'll need to order from the menu, per combinations to experience the Korean BBQ feast. They'll cook it for you in the kitchen and place a small stove at your table. Outdoor dining is open. During these difficult times, the service is always 5 stars. Come out and support your local KBBQ spot.<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< rate>

We’ve always enjoyed going here for our Korean food fix, friendly staff. What started out at $16.99 for all you could eat from a fixed menu became $23.99 just before COVID-19 shut them down. We thought they were a casualty but turns out after driving by this week that they are open again with limited seating outside. Food is no longer all you can eat but you pick from a menu, see attached photo of items and pricing. A little pricy. I will add another review once we visit today 9-5-20 to advise on portions in relation to prices. One thing not mentioned on menu with meals are sides that traditionally cone when ordering. It does mention sides on boxed meals.<//Review>

<text>The service is really great. Everything comes out fast. The atmosphere is very quiet so you can hear each other. The list of meat for AYCE  is small but delicious. My favorite is the spicy pork! Definitely recommend this place for AYCE KBBQ.< /text>< date>

<Text>Many Korean BBQ restaurants have similar food style, but too many are noise bombs with over-loud K-Pop or other piped audio.  Hwang's is different -- a pleasant quiet place to enjoy food and conversation.
A fixed-price all-you-can-eat grill-at-the-table BBQ, service is pleasant and attentive.  Staff will pleasantly bring repeats of whatever you desire, including salads and veggies and the various pickle dishes that are not an afterthought.  They pleasantly bring what you specially like or ask for.
Will return.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Hwang's Restaurant is a pretty small Korean restuarant with an all-you-csn eat Korean BBQ option. While their BBQ memu options aren't abundant, the meats they do have to offer are quite decent. The one thing that was discomforting were the awakard swivel stools they have you sit in. My butt felt like a pancake after getting up from my table.<//review>

Service was very slow. Pork belly and black pork belly lacked flavor. The marinated beef and spicy  pork had the same seasoning. Beef ribs were the best option. It's all you can eat for $22.95 per person<//Review>

< review>
Went on a Monday around 5. The place itself seems a bit small, about 8 grills in the main room and a few private rooms for the ayce. The place is ran by some very friendly older women. The portions are big when you order so i would recommend asking for a half order or just for a little bit. The bulgogi wasn’t as flavorful as others I’ve had, but still very good. Most of the things one would need like napkins, water, and utensils are all around the area for people to grab so there’s not much need to keep flagging down somebody to get you things besides food. Also keep in mind that the chairs are padded stools and don’t have back support. Still a very fun and tasty restaurant, I’ll definitely be back!<//review>

Oh man, first time at a Korean bbq. It was outstanding. You have to try it. Well lit, around 10 tables, excellent choices. My favorites were brisket (#1), sliced beef (#5) & the ribs (#6 or #7).</Review>

< Review>
When we arrived there were plenty of available tables open.  There were about 10 choices of meats available compared to other Korean barbecues that may offer up to 30 options for the same price. There was no advertise lunch or dinner menu specials to distinguish price.

We had a pleasant experience with hiccups that included not being served rice, sides, and constantly asking for waiters attention. The staff was very friendly but we had to continue repeating ourselves when we ordered sides and condiments when only part of it arrived.

In conclusion, the restaurant was great but I left with a feeling that I did not get my money's worth.

< review>
Good place for AYCE Korean BBQ, especially for a late night craving (open till 1am) when all other places are closed.  Swivel seats with no backing didn't bother me, and easier to get in&out compared to booths.  I didn't have any issues with the service, although I noticed that the staff seemed more upbeat and friendly to Korean speaking customers, but with others it was more of a diplomatic interaction.  It didn't bother me, but just putting it out there for those that like a smile with their service.  As for bang for your buck, there are less expensive KBBQ in the area, or fancier ones in the same price range, but for late night this may be the only one open.<//review>

Terrible service. Called out the service requests several times but they just ignore me.  Also had a water leakage from the ceiling. They didn’t charge me since I was so upset. Foods are ok but don’t go this place if you enjoy your meal.<//review>

They have window seating and seating in the middle if you don't want AYCE. The best part is that they don't Baby you and cook your food for you to hurry you out the door. They are very welcoming and multiple people will see if you need more of anything.<//review>< Pictures>

The food wasn't worth the amount of money they charge. There are a lot of KBBQ places on Western, I gave that moon KBBQ the last reviewer stated and just just as satisfied without breaking the bank.</review>

Moon KBBQ is just as good and wayyy cheaper</Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Ahhh well, everything they give is delicious. What I didn't like was the pork they have. It would lack more savor. From the menu I asked for the number A, I'd better have asked for the B for the next one. And the A its price is $ 69.99

(Original)
Ahhh pues todo lo que dan esta rico. Lo que si no me gusto fue la carne de puerco que tienen. Le faltaria  mas savor. Del menu pedi el numero A, mejor hubiese pedido el B para la proxima. Y el A su precio es de $69.99< /Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) I eat unlimited amount of delicious meat, but the price is too cheap ~ I ate too well. I ate tea, beef ribs, beef bulgogi, and the meat was good and delicious. The side dishes are evenly distributed, and the children ate well ~
It's the third Korean meal on the fourth day of the trip, but it's good ~ ^^ haha
Oh yeah! I rented it and moved, but parking was easy.

맛있는 고기를 무제한으로 먹는데 가격도 넘 저렴~ 너무 잘 먹었어요. 저는 차돌배기, 소갈비, 소불고기 먹었는데 육질도 좋고 맛있었어요. 반찬도 골고루 나오고, 아이들이 넘 잘 먹었네요~
여행 4일째  3번째 먹는 한식인데 넘 좋아요~^^ ㅎㅎ
참! 렌트해서 이동했는데 주차도 편했어요.</Review>

If you need insurance this is the place after browsing around they where able to find me the best price.

<Review>Horrible customer service!!!!  My husband and I open the policy on November 11, 2016 same day I had called to cancel less the 2 hours after payment was processed, because we found a better rate elsewhere. Maria informed we would need to come to office to sign cancellation form we couldn't make it it was close to closing. On November 12, 2016 we went into the office around 9:40 AM to sign the cancellation paperwork with Araceli. At this point we only had the policy open for a total of 18 hours. We were then told by the so-called Manager "Mauricio"  Who kept communicating through Araceli and not once did he come out of his office !  At one point she had to go looking for him outside while he was taking a break .That we could expect a refund check that could take up 3 weeks! Then I call today which is November 16 2016 to check the status of the refund to make sure that it was done correctly, and I spoke with the Maria she then informed me that we wouldn't even be getting the full refund back it would a partial of 61.00 dollars. Which is ridiculous for having a policy opened for only 18 hours!!! I paid a total of 130.00 I understand the 20.00 processing fee, but I should be entitled to a refund of 110.00. If this can not be resolved by corporate which I have spoken to all ready ! I will be sending this off to the Better Business Bureau!< /Review>< Pics>

Mauricio went above and beyond with his service in finding the best quote for my brand new car. I went to a different branch in Rosemead, but had horrible experience. I decided to go to Whittier because I heard of Mauricio under reviews and no lie he is the man to go to. His staff is also good and friendly makes going to buy insurance fun and not boring.<//Text>

Bad customer service.
They charge a 10$ fee to pay
When they look up insurances, they don't look for the best price or service.
They increase their fee beyond what is allowed by headquarters. I would highly recommend they get audited and inspected. I see a lot of money being pocketed at THIS LOCATION. Go to the location in southgate for fair and better customer service<//Text>

At first the broker Daniella seemed like a good person but that is her act. She will befriend you and then rip you off. She told me that I was paying 208 dollars for the first two months and her broker fees. My insurance was going to be through Infinity Insurance. I call Infinity insurance and they said that the broker only paid the first month. She kept 119 dollars. My insurance was going to be 68 dollars a month. The rest was for paper work. I called the brokers headquarters, Freeway Insurance, and they said that she can’t be saying that I was paying for the first and last month. This place will rip you off be warned.< /review>

<text>Do not come to this place. They will say one thing then change it on you in the middle of the month. I lost over $300 because of this place. If you are ok with getting one price one week then the next a more expensive place and having this happen every month then this is the place for you. They do not even want to do a refund.< /text><Date>1505505122769<//Date>< gmapID>

<Review>I called the this location on February 25th. I was told by phone the I only needed to bring with me $109.00 for the first month and I did not needed enything else. I asked her if I needed to bring like a month forward or so she said no! I go in wanted to get full insurance, now I'm there. And it turned out to  be I needed to pay $460 on spot I did had the money but what I didn't like was the lie!!! I was told that I needed to pay that was because paper fee and 1 month forward. I'm a creditor so I'm good with numbers. When I did math I catch up to her and let her know that if I paid 1st month and 1 more month forward plus the paper fee will only be 260 and the lady started to do her numbers on a calculator. She made the payments of $139 × 12 months the quickly just added $460 didn't explained why. So we started to discuss the numbers and said that I was just confusing her. I laughed and went step by step with her with the numbers and I was right the were those $460 more just because. When I questioned her about it she started mumbling and couldn't explain why. I looked at straight to her eyes and told her be honest no more lies you got me to here with a lie on the phone so start being honest you just charging this fees just because. She looked down and said yes. I understand that free way insurance is a third party company but come on don't lie to the customers and blame your lies to the insurance provider. Be HONEST! And today I got a paper of insurance cancellation. Besides the bad customer service I received do to the lady who helped me out put my name wrong when I had repeated my self and spelled my name and last name more than 3 times on the phone and in person! Free Way Insurance be HONEST TO YOUR CUSTOMERS REMEMBER THERE IS MORE INSURANCE PROVIDERS SO YOU SHOULD BE HONORED OF CUSTOMERS PREFERENCE TO YOU AND TREAT THEM WITH RESPECT JUST BY LYING YOUR ARE DISRESPECTING YOUR CONSUMER AS PERSON AND CUSTOMER!

(Translated by Google) I went with my husband on 3/7/17 to the freeway insurance offices of the Whittier Blv determined to terminate the car policy contract because there was a change in my policy that I did not know and did not notify me. But when I got in there and we went to lie down for Miss Michelle, and because of the way she received us as if we had always been known as friends or family, the deal was so warm that I was forgetting the reason I went and after that She clarified to me the reason for the change and so kindly that the truth is that I was happy and more satisfied than before because I could make some changes in which I was much better than even before I was a client of them. Thanks to Michelle for thinking about me and for that warm welcome and service. Thank you Michelle and Mauricio God bless you 👍🏼👏🏼 I recommend this place to everyone I don't think they will find better prices and better service

Yo iba con mi esposo el día 3/7/17 a las oficinas de freeway insurance de la Whittier Blv decidida a terminar el contrato de la póliza del auto por que hubo un cambio en mi póliza que yo no sabía y no me avían avisado. Pero cuando entre ahí y fuimos a tendidos por la señorita Michelle, y por la manera que nos recibió como si fuéramos conocidos desde siempre como amigos o familia el trato fue tan abrigado que asta se me estaba olvidando la razón por la que fui y después que ella me aclaró el motivo del cambio y tanta amabilidad que la verdad es que asta salí feliz y mas satisfecha que antes por que pude aser unos cambios en la cual me fue mucho mejor que incluso antes que yo fuera cliente de ellos. Gracias A Michelle por aser me reflexionar y por ese caluroso recibimiento y servicio. Gracias Michelle y Mauricio que Dios los bendiga 👍🏼👏🏼 A todos se los recomiendo este lugar no creo que encontrarán mejores precios y mejor servicio</text>

It's nice, i miss the old over hang scoreboard looked much better but rinks are typically in good condition. It's outdoors so it doesn't get too hot, a big plus. Staff is pretty nice and open to helping. When it comes to the leagues they could maybe do a little better on making sure people play in the skill bracket they should be playing, but typically not too much of a problem. Overall happy to play there.< /text>

Overall it's fun to play in the outdoor atmosphere of the rink.  In the winter the rinks get too slippery to play on, and games are frequently cancelled.

The locker rooms were recently repainted, which was a step up, as they were getting old.

However the floorboards of the rinks themselves are a bit weathered, causing the puck to bounce frequently.< /text>

Played here for the high school hockey Freeway Faceoff game. The locker rooms are a little smaller than I'd like and it's very busy so I don't think they get to clean them often. But they have good concessions and the ice conditions are nice.</Text>

As far as rinks go this one is pretty good. Refs call a fair game 9 out of 10 times. I would like to see them invest a little in the roofs.</Text>

I've been playing here for years and my patience has finally run out for this place.

The only thing it has going for it is that it has two OK rinks and one subpar rink in a decent location in Irvine. If Huntington didn't lack air conditioning/quality rinks, and if Corona wasn't beyond the 91 parking lot, I'd be playing there.

For the many thousands of dollars they generate each season from team fees, they still only seem able to manage the place in a barely competent fashion.

Do the games generally run on-time? Sure-ish.

Do they keep adequate stats? Not really, but at least they get the score right.

Are the pucks decent? Good God, no. They started using these horrid purple pucks that bounce around the rink like lacrosse balls. I keep expecting the ghost of Robin Williams to show up as Professor Brainard. As of 27 September 2017, they appear to have returned to proper pucks, but who knows how long that will last as the a manager has a connection to the company that makes the purple ones.

Are their rinks kept in good condition? For the most part, but more than once have I had a crease that feels like someone oiled up and wrestled on it. Oh! And Rink 1 has this beautiful spot where if your defender rings it around your boards, it pops right back out into the slot.

And do they have alright refs? Once again, there are plenty of good ones and some absolute rubbish ones. That very well may just be how they're supervised, though. More than once have my team and I had to wait for 45-60 minutes for a game to start because management forgot to schedule refs, and they also don't do much about vindictive ones (not even going to waste your time going into details there).

The absolute worst part of this management team, though, is that they seem to consistently hold everything off until absolute last minute. I just now found out an hour before my game (while I was on the 405) that my game was cancelled tonight because the team we were supposed to play dropped out for the season. You mean to tell me that the team decided to drop out OF THE SEASON last minute, and Irvine Inline told us as soon as they found out? That is extremely unlikely. If it were just about any other rink complex, I'd maybe believe that, but I just can't with this place anymore.

Even more recently, a new manager took over for certain days of the week, but she failed to mention to anyone in our league that our championship game would be held as the end of a double header right after our initial playoff game. I checked the website as soon as an e-mail was sent saying that the playoff times were posted. No mention of a double header was there. No further e-mail was sent with this information. No mention of it on the website was made available until, yet again, the last minute. Why would anyone check the website again if no notice that a change to the schedule was made? The most classic part about all of this came when the girl, in a display of pure professionalism, was bad mouthing both teams for THEIR mistake at the front desk as I was leaving with the remainder of the team. Yes.Somehow, in her world, she was completely not at fault for her complete lack of communication skills. People are apparently supposed to remain ever vigilant to make up for her managing flaws. Of course, our captain had to initiate contact to reschedule, and she made absolutely no apology for the mix-up.

I was on three teams this past season, and it seemed like every week, something new was going wrong ranging from horrible officiating to lackadaisical administration.

Do yourself a favor and save up for ice hockey or pray that other roller rinks open up. The Anaheim Ducks should feel ashamed to have this place representing them.</Text>

Used shoes? How gross!! Ordered a pair of nikes online. I was so disgusted when I open the box and realized the shoes were USED. So gross! These were for a gift so I’m glad I checked them before I gave them to the person. Oh and they wanted to charge me $8.50 to return them. Never again will I buy from DSW.<//review>

<gmap_id>0x80db7e155cbd4791:0xde3ea39cb2c28f25<//gmap_id><review>The store is huge but despite this their selection is kinda traditional.. nothing stands specifically out if you're looking for designer or different.. no boots with sneaker bottoms.. basic Vans designs not a ton of skater shoe variety

Not a lot of Nike options either compared to the Nike outlets... I think Amazon you'll find more styles.. but you have to go to the real stores if you want something nice... I dont think anything stands out.. pricing isn't amazing... was at the Vans store in South Coast Plaza and they had pairs on sale for 30$ cuz of covid and really unique designs and newest product</review>< UserId.>

<user_id>111997315307417154064<//user_id><review>Showed up to pick up an order from online.    I think they sold my shoes to someone else because the wrong shoes were given to me at curbside pick up in a box with no labeling, or SKU. So no quality control..  Usually they check the box to match the shoe, the invoice and their sizes.   The cashier helping me was so sweet - Angelique was her name I think.  Very helpful!   She went over to her superior, who actually had the audacity to question if what she was saying was true..   I finally butted in and said, miss, they are the wrong shoes.  They didn't have my order so I did a return, was issued a gift card and then  picked them up in  Redlands.   It was great of Angeliqe to set up at Redlands for me to pick up and honor my online discounts.   Thank you!<//review></record>

<Review>I can not recommend DSW Temecula enough!!! The ladies here were do incredibly helpful! I came in needing shoes for work... I'm on my feet all day and support is essential.  I had purchased some Rykas online but had problems with the fit. I got amazing attention and help from the girls, Kirsten (?) Faith and, darn, can not remember the name of the other girl. All of them were helpful,  sweet and you can tell, truly cared! We wound up buying other stuff as well as new Rykas. Thanks ladies,  this will forever be our go to place for shoes!!!<//Review></record>

<text>Over the years I've found some great shoes at DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse. Today I stopped in to see what they may have and was treated to incredible, heartfelt service from Loretta. She was thoughtful, kind and helpful. She even noticed an issue with my foot and made some recommendations on how I could get my toes to relax. Who thinks about that?! It was definitely more than just a shoe buying experience.< /text>< Rating>

I get that they raise money for others but used furniture should be less than 50%of what it really retails for. They are close to 75% and higher off that regular rate. Nice stuff but if I can pay a couple dollars more for brand new it's a no brainier not to buy from here. If they fix the prices I'd say five stars but as is three or lower.< /review>

<Review>I like visiting this store for inexpensive household replacement items such as door/drawer knobs, handles, ovens, bathroom sinks, furniture etc.  Helps their agency and the store is fairly well organized.  Parking is not a problem, based on the shopping center its located at. Will definitely return to purchase items in the future.</Review><Time>1600053869255</Time><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

<date>1562151827958<//date><Rate>5< /Rate><text>I love the Habitat for Humanity Restore in Simi Valley. All the people that donate
their time to help you like Taneci, Anthony 1 and Anthony 2 couldn’t have been more helpful.  I furnished my entire kitchen with custom made cabinets after an unscrupulous contractor took off with all my money and didn’t do anything but demolish my house.  I never would have been able to do it without these wonderful people at the restore.  I recommended them to my doctor who is so excited to come check it out.  And you are helping other families get their own house when you purchase items there. Sure beats the chain stores by a mile.  Thank you all at Simi Valley Restore!

My wife and I always score really great deals at this place. They offer a wide variety of household furniture as well as doors and windows for those well needed projects.</text>

Giving them 2 stars because the volunteers are cool. On the other hand, the company could get a better manager. This woman does not have appropriate manager/sales etiquette. I was going to purchase a item, that was on the floor.... it had a price etc. The manager, was trying to take my item away, instead of honoring the price of the item.  she said, “oh, well that item was supposed to be sold, along with another item, for double the price” I wasn’t going to purchase the other item, it was broken. Also,  after plugging my item in,  it was also broken, but it wouldn’t take much to fix the item. But the manager was still trying to say, “it shouldn’t been on the floor for that price”. There was NO WAY I was going to purchase both items for double the price, when both items were broken.
Then, while I was trying to work with her, another customer came up, wanted to purchase four identical items, it had a price tag on it. The manager instead of honoring the price for the items, she made up her own price, and said “ it was supposed to be this price”. A “GOOD MANAGER” does not do that! I have never seen a manager ever act that way. I walked out in disbelief. I will NEVER shop at this store ever again!<//Text>

Total Awesomeness of Savings. Everytime I take a trip down to this location I usually find something random that is necessary. And they might knock off a few bucks(my example, item was 25 bucks, I only had 20, they hooked it up even though  I was short that 5) I Get it,the stuff  is either used or being thrown away, but sometimes its leftovers from a construction job site. . It's great for the community.  Thanks for being open<//text>

Uhhh EXPEN$$$IVE! Comedy store Expensive! Like Candid Camera Reaction Expensive! This place needs to move their junk to make space for NEW junk to come in! But I think they really want to hang on to everything. Seems like it. Only saw empty handed walk-outs of people after they asked the costs of some things they were interested in: place is disorganized and expensive. Know what I did with the walking out people? I followed them.</review>

(Translated by Google) Ai very good things and it is not very expensive, it is recommended only for personal things or the other disc such as radios, none of that.

This place was recommended to us by a close friend, and we are so thankful we made the stop here. There was a line of about 10 people in front of us, but it went pretty fast. The tacos were absolutely delicious, some of the best we’ve had. The back patio was dog friendly. We decided to grab a blanket from the car and sit in the grass area and have a picnic. We will definitely be back!< /review>

Not that great. Not that bad. Pretty mediocre Mexican food. Probably great if you’re hungover. Staff was super nice and worked hard. I can tell that they keep their ingredients and recipes very authentic. But I just was not wowed by the place.< /Review>

<text>Good, moderately priced Mexican food from a Santa Barbara institution. Everything is prepared right as you order it. Good range of selections, but decidedly  not fancy and in the same building it's been in for decades. Portions are large, so  be aware that your eyes aren't bigger than your stomach.<//text>< Gmap_id>

This place is hyped up to be more than what it really was. There was a super long line and it wasn’t a fast line. Service was good and it looked like an authentic Mexican food with Mexican ladies working the kitchen. The food however was quite disappointing. I ordered the tacos de adobada and tacos de costilla and their guacamole. All the tacos were bland and not seasoned, the guacamole although good was also bland and needed some salt. The flour tortillas were really good though. I would not be back lol</Text>

We came to this place for a meeting. This spot was recommended to us by a friend.  Well, it was very nice. The staff members were very polite and we had an excellent feeling. The food was just great. We had a great time and we will visit this place again. Recommended.<//Text>

<rating>3</rating><text>Honestly I don't get it.  This place is famous. Got very strong recommendations.   The tacos we got were.... OK.  Not all that tasty.   Served really plain.  The tortillas were better than the meat.
My son got some beans with chorizo and bacon.... sounds delicious,  right?
No. Bland. How is that even possible?< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Super basic tacos. Nothing fancy here, just solid, authentic Mexican tacos. Stack some good meat on a couple corn tortillas and that's it. Strongly recommend the pork, especially with the melted cheese. Getting some fundito is always a good call, so you can drizzle that over everything else.<//text>

It's been overhyped with the old Julia Child endorsement that's drawn up its demand but in 2021 it can't keep up and doesn't compete. Food prep time needs to improve. Quality isn't the same. Would recommend any other taqueria nearby - there's many more that deserve your money and time.</review><Rating>1<//Rating></record>

<resp>None</resp><review>I heard so much about this place and wanted to try it as I was passing through Santa Barbara.  I was very disappointed. I ordered a chorizo taco, I did not care for the meat at all, was a little greasy. I also had an adobado taco, seasoned well, but nothing spectacular and I also ordered a gordita. The masa lacked flavor and needed to be salted, the beans were not spicy at all. I will say, the salsas were delicious and I did enjoy the fresh made tortillas.  I had an horchata which tasted really refreshing with my food, however, it did leave a bad after taste in my mouth.  Possibly came from the chorizo taco? Definitely will not be eating here again.<//review></record>

<GmapID>0x80e913828c602d77:0x3c604d53e5483c9c<//GmapID><text>this is one of my boss's favorite spots in town (and also apparently Julia Child's?) they take cash only by the way and they have a small parking lot as well as some street parking. there's a few outdoor tables and a ledge where you can stand and eat as well. very limited indoor seating (it's really more for waiting for your food but some people sit)

I ordered the vegetable tamal and the super rica especial while my friend ordered two steak tacos and also the super rica. We also got the horchata which was quite cinnamon-y but a bit too sweet for my taste. My friend loved it though!

Vegetable tamal: (5/5) have never had a tamale before and I had no idea what to expect but this was delicious! The texture was great but it didn't come out super hot so that was a bit disappointing. The cream sauce on top is truly delectable. My only other note is that I wish it had a bit more flavor or spice (I added the spicy salsa and pico de gallo but it was still not to my standards)

La super rica especial: (5/5) If you get anything here, I'd recommend you get this because it is spectacular. The char of the roasted peppers with the creaminess of the cheese and the flavor from the pork is...chefs kiss. They make their own flour tortillas in house (which is interesting as I'm used to corn) but the tortillas were really wonderful and a bit thicker as well. It comes with 3 tortillas but I honestly would've been happy with just the 1 since it was too big to pick up anyways

Steak tacos: (4/5) the steak was not dry which I usually get worried about - it was sooo juicy and jam packed with flavor. I would order this again next time too!</text>< name>

<text>I’ve been to this place numerous times, lines are pretty quick to move. Only downside it’s CASH ONLY, so come prepared with at least a $20 or more. Tacos are medium to small sized, so 3 orders generally needed to feel satisfied imo. Tortillas are made on the spot & amazing, meat is suberb but when we went it was bit dry considering all their sauces are not there like how it was before covid. We got the #1 & #14. In hindsight we should just got more of the latter. #14 is like a cheesey chorizo fondue type of meal that you slap on tacos & my god was it tasty! Also their horchata is suberb, my girl eyes opened up when she drank it! I would definitely recommend!</text>< Pictures>

This definitely lived up to the hype! The flavors were delicious and really gave us a new appreciation for Mexican food! However, the wait was loooong. Understandable, I guess... And the portions were a bit small, so we had to go to Mony's after to get some snack tacos to fill us up. But all in all, we would visit again if we come back to Santa Barbara!< /text>

<Text>We arrived for a mid afternoon snack and although there was a decent crowd in the restaurant, we didn't have to wait longer than 2 minutes to order. We stepped up to the counter to order from the friendly man who we assume manages or owns the restaurant. Behind him was a women hand pressing and grilling fresh tortillas made to each order. I ordered one beef and one pork taco while my girlfriend placed an order for a beef taco and some guacamole. In addition to that, we both purchased a Mexican Coca-Cola from the bottle.

When you have finished ordering you can sit in a room that has an a fantastic views of the mountains and the hills of Santa Barbara homes that lead up to them. The lighting is particularly nice this room because you are surrounded by windows. At this time in the day I also noticed some people do work laptops and taking their time eating as they read the newspaper. I was a very pleasant environment to eat in.

One could argue that a good taco is only as good as its tortilla and let me tell you! This place makes one bombass of a tortilla. The fillings were simple and traditional. There was an option of three types of salsa. All of them were you know, top-notch as well. And if your looking for a little something something extra, order some guacamole because that was delicious. You know... is was just really really good. Check it out.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>If you like Mexican food, you have to try this place. Mexican food is probably my favorite type of food but often authentic Mexican restaurants aren't really to my liking. Mainly because I only like chicken breast and authentic places generally serve thigh. Luckily this place serves breast meat.

I had their number 8, chicken breast with onions and green peppers with corn tortillas. Perfect. It was very good. The wife had number 16 especial, marinated pork, Pasilla peppers and cheese. It was amazing.

The restaurant is a bit of a whole in the wall. It doesn't even really have a sign. But everyone seems to know about it. The line was out the door. But the food is worth the wait.</text>< Pics>

Love the made to order tortillas with every dish. Mainly menu items are based on whatever can be incorporated onto, in between and over the small corn tortillas. Tacos are also a main stay. Nice covered patio section to enjoy your eats. No burritos or tipical large combo plates. Mostly el la crate. Cheers< /Review>

<text>If you like Mexican food, you have to try this place. Mexican food is probably my favorite type of food but often authentic Mexican restaurants aren't really to my liking. Mainly because I only like chicken breast and authentic places generally serve thigh. Luckily this place serves breast meat.

I had their number 8, chicken breast with onions and green peppers with corn tortillas. Perfect. It was very good. The wife had number 16 especial, marinated pork, Pasilla peppers and cheese. It was amazing.

The restaurant is a bit of a whole in the wall. It doesn't even really have a sign. But everyone seems to know about it. The line was out the door. But the food is worth the wait.</text>< username>

<Text>How to even begin... this place is literally the best. We’ve had so many types of Mexican in San Francisco, Baja California, Mexico City, around Texas, but we were blown away by the quality and the prices here. We’d highly recommend stopping here if you’re in the area, their special is fantastic, but you really can’t go wrong.</Text><resp>None<//resp><rate>5<//rate></record>

As always, delicious food, great variety and awesome service! Their meat is super tender and my favorite — the raja taco (taco de raja). We drive 2 hours just to enjoy their yummy food! Worth the drive 😋<//Text>

<review>We arrived for a mid afternoon snack and although there was a decent crowd in the restaurant, we didn't have to wait longer than 2 minutes to order. We stepped up to the counter to order from the friendly man who we assume manages or owns the restaurant. Behind him was a women hand pressing and grilling fresh tortillas made to each order. I ordered one beef and one pork taco while my girlfriend placed an order for a beef taco and some guacamole. In addition to that, we both purchased a Mexican Coca-Cola from the bottle.

When you have finished ordering you can sit in a room that has an a fantastic views of the mountains and the hills of Santa Barbara homes that lead up to them. The lighting is particularly nice this room because you are surrounded by windows. At this time in the day I also noticed some people do work laptops and taking their time eating as they read the newspaper. I was a very pleasant environment to eat in.

One could argue that a good taco is only as good as its tortilla and let me tell you! This place makes one bombass of a tortilla. The fillings were simple and traditional. There was an option of three types of salsa. All of them were you know, top-notch as well. And if your looking for a little something something extra, order some guacamole because that was delicious. You know... is was just really really good. Check it out.< /review>< Pics>

This definitely lived up to the hype! The flavors were delicious and really gave us a new appreciation for Mexican food! However, the wait was loooong. Understandable, I guess... And the portions were a bit small, so we had to go to Mony's after to get some snack tacos to fill us up. But all in all, we would visit again if we come back to Santa Barbara!</text>

There's usually line outside whenever I go so be prepared to be in line for half an hour. The food is very flavorful and the sauce is delicious. Make sure to get the honey and just put it all over everything. I usually like the tenders more than the sandwich at other places but the sandwiches here are so well balanced with the cole slaw.</Text>

A Santa Barbara institution featuring traditional classics and regional specialties — one of our favorites.

Bring cash and use the usually long wait time to study the menu — as the main hold up here is people not knowing what’s being offered.

Everything is homemade and the tortillas are YUMMY! Enjoy a cold beer alongside and the divine smells.<//Text>

<Review>I’ve been to this place numerous times, lines are pretty quick to move. Only downside it’s CASH ONLY, so come prepared with at least a $20 or more. Tacos are medium to small sized, so 3 orders generally needed to feel satisfied imo. Tortillas are made on the spot & amazing, meat is suberb but when we went it was bit dry considering all their sauces are not there like how it was before covid. We got the #1 & #14. In hindsight we should just got more of the latter. #14 is like a cheesey chorizo fondue type of meal that you slap on tacos & my god was it tasty! Also their horchata is suberb, my girl eyes opened up when she drank it! I would definitely recommend!</Review>< rate>

Prepare for a wait to order. Also prepare for a wait to receive your food selections. The parking lot fits approximately 1 car, so street parking will hopefully be your friend. The eating area isn't large and can full. The bathroom is small and carries the ambiance beach town taco stand dinginess/quaintness. With all this being said, the food is incredible and employees are helpful. I never pass up an opportunity to eat here. I will gladly wait in line. I will gladly embrace the crowds. And I will gladly include my stop at La Super Rica in every Santa Barbara visit!  5 stars all the way for making my taco dreams come true!< /review>

If it's your first time, treat yourself, and order #16. You won't be disappointed.
The handmade corn tortillas leaves you craving for more!<//text>

After reading all the reviews decided to do take out here and was very disappointed.  We tried marinated pork and chicken and both were super tasteless and dry with nothing on it.  All 4 of us thought the same. I seriously don’t understand why they have gotten such great reviews, maybe the management or cooks changed but I would rather go to a dozen other places in Santa Barbara.</text>

<review>There's usually line outside whenever I go so be prepared to be in line for half an hour. The food is very flavorful and the sauce is delicious. Make sure to get the honey and just put it all over everything. I usually like the tenders more than the sandwich at other places but the sandwiches here are so well balanced with the cole slaw.<//review><gmap_id>0x80e913828c602d77:0x3c604d53e5483c9c< /gmap_id>< userid>

This place is a Santa Barbara classic. If you live in town and you haven’t been, shame on you! If you’re visiting, it’s definitely a recommended stop. Try anything with tortillas, as they’re made fresh with your order and are some of the best in town. Be aware that the fare is simple and bare bones, but that’s a part of its appeal.

This restaurant is cash only and has no ATM on site.</text>

<review>Place is cash only and will have a wait at lunch, but it is worth it!! Food is cheap and amazing. Horchata here is delicious. If you get the chorizo quesadilla, be aware that it's whole chunks and not ground (I prefer chunks more tho!!).< /review>< pictures>

Great selection of food, with some good specials. Decent number of Mexican beers and non-alcoholic drinks on offer as well. This place is cash only, so make sure you're carrying enough (decent meal for two with drinks would be $25-$40).

Food is good with seemingly authentic flavours, but I would not call it exceptional. I would recommend the Tamale in food and the Tamarindo in drinks. The ambience is average - it is in a sort of a shed, and feels like you're eating at a canteen, but I guess that adds to the experience.

There is usually a long line to enter this place. We had to wait for about 30 mins on a Friday afternoon. It is a good experience eating here overall, but I am not sure if it is worth the wait.< /Review>

<review>The place is very nice and super popular so the lines are a bit long. I got two tacos and they were so good that I got another one even though I was already full. The meat tasted especially good and had some sort of sauce on it that made it delicious. There is also a wide selection of drinks if you are thirsty.

The tables that you say on were also very nice and comfortable with lots of space.< /review>< Pictures>

< review>
I may be biased on this opinion because this is one of my favorite places, and the long line and wait are always worth it for me. If you haven't been, the tortillas are all homemade tortillas, and there is usually a wait, and it's cash only! So bring cash!!!!  We bought tacos de bistec, tamales,  Chile relleno, guacamole, rajas, and even café de olla. Yup we tried it all. The tacos are a little bland  but with the right ingredients they are very good (I'm talking lime, guacamole, and salsa), I always get these. They had a few specials for the day we tried the Chile relleno and the chicken tamal I enjoyed both. The coffee was good with a cinnamon kick  a little too sweet for my taste. The rajas are always on the menu and they always taste amazing. They have cheese and are layered on top of two homemade tortillas. They can be a little spicy from time to time. Always get a guacamole side, they give you a lot and it's a good serving for sharing and adding away to your food as your heart desires.< /review>

I read a ton of positive reviews of this place so I decided to try it out. Went around 7:40 pm and there was a long line outside of the place. First off parking was a bit of a hassle. You have to find street parking. Next it took us about 15 minutes just to order. After finally ordering we had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the food came out. It seemed like they were backed up. Now the tacos were pretty good. Decent flavor, steak wasn't juicy I felt like it was kind of dry. The side of guacamole was delicious really made the meal. The horchata was delicious so glad I ordered it. Overall the taste of the tacos along with the wait time isn't worth it for me. I gave it three stars due to overall flavor and ridiculous wait time and parking access. The best tacos I've had are in Tijuana, Mexico. Also don't forget to bring cash. Cards are not accepted.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaDc82OoLap1KRRc68nCtPdM2i2q51riDDszJ5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80e913828c602d77:0x3c604d53e5483c9c<//Gmap_id></record>

We ordered food from here on July 4th and it was so delicious!  We had chicken enchiladas and carne asada, rice and beans.  Everything was delicious!  We were so happy with our meal. It was fresh and just full of flavor.  Definitely recommend!</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>One of our final stops was in Santa Barbara, in a restaurant called ‘La Superica’. It looked like an old Mexican barrack with its white walls and blue windows. It was not fancy at all and it was nothing like what I would have picked to conclude a mind-blowing trip. But as soon as I went inside I felt that the atmosphere was very welcoming. It was packed with joyful people enjoying lively dishes and for a minute I forgot that my journey was nearly over. I ordered tacos and as soon as the food was placed on the table I understood why my friends took me here.

The fresh handmade tortilla was beautiful with a golden shade of yellow contrasting with the different mouthwatering ingredients sitting on its heart. I could smell the fragrant odour of the corn flour with a zest of lime tickling my nose. The meat had a lovely brown caramelised tint and smelt heavenly. It was tender, smoky, juicy and cooked to perfection. The red salsa was thick, creamy and attractively opaque in colour. I could tell the tomatoes had been cooked slowly and mixed with toasted Mexican chilles and chipotle peppers. The topping was a symphony of colours where the chopped green vegetables were dancing with the fresh herbs under a moon of white creamy cheese. I could see the finely minced onions blending with the minced crisp cabbages promising a textural crunch.

No sooner had the fresh taco touched my palate that I felt shivers and stopped. It was absolutely divine! An exquisite pleasure invaded my senses filling me with all California. Each bite, each colour, each flavour had the taste of my trip on the mythical Highway One. I could see the sunny valleys, the Spanish missions, the rugged beach and the surf towns. I could smell the farmers’ stalls on the side of the road, I could hear the Pacific Ocean crashing down below the steep cliffs and I could feel the intoxicating warmth of the Californian sun and the presence of my friends forever with me.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKfOJjoz6uQJwwTpuuytRWdU5T77Rx0-JDHsvr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

Was honestly a little underwhelmed with the place. We made it a point to stop here for lunch since it had such great reviews and so many recommendations. Perhaps we just went in with too high expectations but didn't think the food was that great. Be ready to wait in a very long line. The prices are great. Just not sure it was worth the wait / hype.< /Text>

That will be $13 dollars please. What? You're kidding me. $13. Wow. Best meal for two at such an amazing price.
#16 Super Rica Especial and Tamal Norteno de Puerco.
The tamale was delicious so we went back for seconds. We paired it with the pico de Gallo which was spicy due to a healthy amount of jalapeno.
#16 was also delicious. Heavy cheese, loads of pork on top of the freshly made tortillas.
The place was busy on a Saturday night but not overly crowded.
Definitely worth the visit!< /Review>

This is my favorite Mexican restaurant!  The entire menu is gluten free, a Celiac safe establishment. Amazing food.  Everything I've ordered is awesome.  They have the best tamales I have ever tasted. Rich and deeply flavored, a must try. Everything is made to order, including fresh tortillas.  Sauces, salsas, quesadillas, and every single taco has knocked my socks right off.</Review>

<Text>We had hoped for more, as the reviews were raving about the food here. But most of our meat was over cooked and dry. The best dish we had was the Super-Rica Especial, with the cheese on top. That was quite delicious! Also, the horchata and the watermelon juice were delicious as well<//Text><response>None<//response>< Pics>

Be ready to wait in line outside, the ordering process is a bit slow with one person taking orders on a notepad and passing them back.

Yet the food comes out the side window to the covered eating area quite quickly. This plus the handmade corn tortillas and salsa helps bolster the experience.

Wait- not ideal
Food- so worth it
Service- (based on ordering/picking up food) great, really friendly</review>

Outstanding tacos, fast service, friendly staff & clean restroom.  My only "gripe" is that they take cash only and have a tiny note posted on the window stating that.<//Text>

Perhaps we just went in with too high expectations but didn't think the food was that great. Be ready to wait in a very long line. The prices are great.

<text>Small kitchen, long long waiting lines, and the food was just Ok defined not worth waiting in lines.

Beware they cook veg, chicken, bead, and pork on the same platform. You might end up getting some chunks of other meat in you plate.

No good for pure Vegans and Non Beef & Pork dinners.<//text>< rate>

They have the best tamales I have ever tasted. Rich and deeply flavored, a must try. Everything is made to order, including fresh tortillas.  Sauces, salsas, quesadillas, and every single taco has knocked my socks right off.</text>< pics>

💥Great Food💥 I've been eating at La Super- Rica since I was 19 years old. When I first came out to California. 1970💥
Nice Family owned. Julia Child's, a world renown chef, was a regular customer.</Text>

Best Mexican food I've had (Caveat: I haven't been to Mexico, so this is based on a range of experiences in the US.)  First visit in 1984; the food is still excellent. The problem is deciding what NOT to order. Superb tortillas, freshly made.  Don't let the line scare you. (And I don't wait in restaurant lines)    Quality/Price ratio is huge.</review>

Hands down some of the best corn tortillas I have ever eaten. For me, the value of a taqueria is reflected by the quality of their tortillas, and this place is no exception.

We got two tacos and a tamale. Great price and decent size portions. Highly recommended!<//text>

La Super Rica is one of our go to restaurants when visiting Santa Barbara, it is a institution in the area. Everything on the menu is delicious.  Authentic Mexican food.  Home made tortillas.  Definitely worth a visit. Not fancy, often a line and parking is a definite challenge,  but well worth it.</review>

Maybe very hyped but the food was deceptively bland and unimpressive. Nothing better than any other random Mexican place.

<text>Born and Raised in Santa Barbara and this is hands down our favorite taco spot. We have been going here for years.

I have get to find a taco spot that compares to or beats my love for La Super Rica. The owner is such a sweet man and they staff,has always been awesome.

When someone asks for a Mexican food spot in SB this is always my suggestion. Since we moved away from SB we only get here once every 3 months. The only down fall is they are closed Tuesday's and Wednesday which is usually the days I end up in town.<//text>< Gmap_id>

Julia Child & Katy Perry's fav taco spot! The food is delicious. Their enchiladas are great. Their steak tacos are a bit dry but the other meats are good. And of course, the hand made corn tortillas make the meal.< /Text>

<Review>It’s as amazing as the reviews say. The tacos were all freshly made in-house, and were thick and flavorful. The meats were fresh and plentiful. My favorite was the chorizo quesadilla!<//Review>< time>

Horrific parking, limited seating, long lines, housed in a small old shack with a tarp for a roof. All is overlooked and overshadowed by it's phenomenal mexican cuisine; a must go to for any person visiting the santa Barbara area.< /Text>

<Review>So incredibly authentic and delicious.  A must go to stop if you are in Santa Barbara.  Worth it as a destination as well or to go out of your way for.  They make everything fresh even the tortillas.  You can see them slicing tomatoes for pico de gallo and making everything else right in front of you.  I miss it now that we’ve left SB. Memorable!!!<//Review>< pics>

Locals enjoy arguing rather or not La Super-Rica deserves its reputation or if it is just riding on Julia Child's coattails. I just know that I always enjoy their food and beverages when I come here. There's usually a line (and I hate lines), but it usually moves fast. I won't get into which Santa Barbara taqueria is the best, I'll just continue to enjoy the good food from all of them.< /text>

<text>Very bland food. We ordered a variety of items. If you like good California and Baja style Mexican food you will be disappointed. People who hate spicy or hot food love this place. I only saw white tourists lined up like me cause Julia Child loved this place. Julia knows French food but she hasn’t had very much Mexican food.</text>< userid>

I want to give it 1 star and say that it is awful, to keep people away and keep the line shorter. 😂 this place is an iconic Mexican place with amazing food. Cash only, long lines, 100% worth the wait. Provecho 😊😉<//review>

Famous taco place. You will not see tacos like this anywhere else. Former UCSB student started it many years ago. It’s not easy to park. The line is long. Dining room is basic. The food is worth waiting for.< /Review>

This is a horrible place to eat, bad food without any taste and the meat so dry, on top of that there were people waiting for service and the owner or whoever was name Emmanuel get to the window and order for 5 people that came in with him even that others were waiting for service.  This was my first and last time that i come in there.<//review>

What an awesome place. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't let it's look scare you away. Everything seems to be made fresh & while you wait, including the corn tortillas. I don't think there is a bad thing on the menu, and everything is so well priced that you can afford to try several items during 1 visit.< /Review>

Unfortunately living on its reputation from years past.    Other places in town have caught up.

Food is fresh with good ingredients. Love the family atmosphere.

Still like to go for the memories.  Try to avoid peak hours since the wait outdoors in the sun is tough</Text>

Visited this local spot for the 1st time, yesterday. My parents always make a special trip here, when they travel along the coast. A "doggy bag" comes home with them for me and my husband. The food is INCREDIBLE! So fresh! Handmade corn tortillas, roasting poblano chiles, fresh tasting aguas frescas. You definitely can not go wrong with this place. A little expanded menu than most little hole-in-the-wall taco places. CASH ONLY!! I suggest trying to get there when they open as I overheard people in line talking that the line can get long. Try the Rajas taco or just order #'s 1, 11, 16, and 20 with some of there house made pico de gallo and red salsa. ENJOY! and don't forget to tip them.</text>

Best taqueria in Santa Barbara.   May be the best anywhere.   The handmade tortillas are fantastic.  Everything on the menu is great.   Don't miss out on #16 Super-Rica Especial.   They don't dress the tacos.  They have a super simple salsa bar - red, green and pico, all are good.  They also have a specials menu.  Give them a shot, especially the tamals.    They always have a line but it moves quick.  Enjoy!</Text>

Stopped here on the way home from a trip to Los Olivos to give traffic a chance to blow over. It was obvious by the line that this is a very popular locals place. They need more staff to keep up with demand. Only one guy working the register and taking orders (and getting abuse from a couple unhappy customers). There was an empty window that could have reduced everyone's stress level with another order taker. For me they lost a star for that. The register and kitchen are in the same small area, so I do give them credit for not having much room to work in. I give them a lot of points just for the tortillas. Small, hand made to order and delicious corn tortillas. My wife reading about them is what drew us to the place. We both ordered chicken tacos and they were pretty good. The chicken was tasty. The dining room was packed and we were tired so we got our order to go and ate in the car. It's about a mile off the freeway but we might give it another chance just because of those tortillas.< /Review>

We plan our drives up and down the coast so that meals can be had here.  Bring your cash and empty tummy for the best, freshest Mexican treats.  Everyone I’ve brought here loves the whole simple scene.< /text>

It usually has a line extending outside the front door. The dining area is humble and covered with a big tarp but it's part of the experience eating there. The food is authentic and they offer both small plates, like the queso bowl, and larger posted which are like fajitas. They've also got excellent homemade salsa and legit selection of Mexican drinks. This place will not disappoint!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Came here with all the hype, but holy moly, the tacos were super bland and tasteless. Probably better when Julia Child came by and ate, but honestly would not recommend this place at all. Super overrated and that is not an hyperbole. You're off better going to Chipotle- at least they have somewhat of a flavor.< /text>

Great Santa Barbara Taco Shop! The pork taco I had was tasty but the unusual cheesey Pastilla taco was the highlight. It is a cash only place and I only had a little cash or I would have tried a couple other things.<//Review>

I don't know why folks go on and on about this place. I have eaten here multiple times and the food is decent.  That's it.  Average.  Also, last visit I had to wait over an hour with my kids to get our meal while I watched people in the dining room walk to the pickup window, effectively skipping the 30 min line, and order a SECOND meal to go... a second meal which was prepared and served before my first meal.  Forget about this place and its nonsense.  There are half a dozen places within 5 miles that won't let you down. Sorry. 1 star.< /Review>

<text>I've been eating here for most of my life. Though I don't live in Santa Barbara anymore, it's still a place I visit every time I'm in town. The nostalgia for years past certainly helps its appeal, but so, too, does the fact that virtually nothing has changed here with the quality of the food. Freshly made tortillas are still a rarity and no place does them better. Mexican food is as varied as any other food culture from such a diverse country, so calling it "the best" isn't really fair. That said, this place is the best!</text>< Pics>

They are located at a corner and, for me, all starts when you look for a space to park your car. They only have 3 spaces in their property and the two sides of the block seem to be taken already so you have to drive around. Once you make it to the line, you usually can count between 5 to 10 people ahead of you. They have a supersmall kitchen and 7 employees that bump each other while working. The cashier not only takes orders, he also receives food from the cooks and serves it to the customers at the counter. All this consumes about 15 to 20 minutes waiting in line and 10 to 15 sitting in front of the table waiting for them to call your order number. Don't  get surprised if they call customers that came after you first. The reward is some of the most tasteful rib, and marinated tacos around SB.</review>< username>

Almost everything they have is gluten free. Tortillas are made fresh with your food.

<Review>Hand made corn tortillas you can watch them preparing in the kitchen and delicious vegetarian tamales. It's a family run hole-in-the-wall and it's a wonderful find! Long lines because it's a favorite with the locals so go a little, not a lot, hungry! So worth the wait, an incredibly sweet family running this restaurant and a million times better than any chain restaurant. Plus let's support Ma and Pa restaurants - please do go if you're in Santa Barbara.<//Review><user>116048898568578226049</user>< username>

One of our favorites restaurants in Santa Barbara.  A institution in the area. Food is always great.  Lots of great choices.  The beans  are amazing.  Super Rica is must if your in the area. Small place, expect a wait.  Parking is also difficult.</review>

<text>This place is a classic. Expect a long line most weekend evenings, but it's so worth it.  The dishes are small and reasonably inexpensive, giving you a chance to taste several offerings. Parking can sometimes be problematic on busy evenings. Great food, highly recommended!</text><user>112547910084042199167<//user>< rating>

The best fresh Mexican food in SB. Handmade tortillas. Innovative tasty specials. Been around over 30 years at that location as family owned and operated business. Cash only. Closed Tues and Weds.<//text>

<Text>It's 4:30pm on a Wed. Drove up to Santa Barbara for the day from Camarillo. This place supposedly has some of the best tacos in Santa Barbara. But I'm never going to taste them because they are CLOSED on Tuesday & Wednesday. Excuse me, am I crazy, or is this just some kind of strange Santa Barbara thing, but who in the world is closed on Tues. and Wed.!!?? A 5 day a week restaurant? Never heard of that one. Asian places closed on Mondays, sure. Must be doing really good in Santa Barbara but my business will never come back here.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPC9tJH8CN9TUt1ddhs_kKgY-899QXBwDjn_PMu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

One of the most delicious Mexican food I ever had is here. Even on Thanksgiving weekend the place was pretty packed with long queue waiting outside. On appearance it looks like any other hole in the wall eateries, but let's not look deceive you 😀</Review>

And wait time to order can vary depending on the time of day and year . From the order wait time until you have food in hand sometimes can be 45 to 1 hr not a not the place for a quick bite . They are closed Tuesday and Wednesday. Enjoy< /text>< Gmap_id>

What an amazing restaurant! "Super Rica" is right!  I wasn't expecting much just by looking at the place from the outside, but that's how it earns it's status as a hidden gem!  Do yourself a favor and try this place out, if you like Mexican food.  You will NOT be disappointed!<//text>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>The food here is okay, it really depends on what you order. If you order the steak tacos they are tough, dry, chewy and bland. But if you order a tamale, you will LOVE IT! Horchata is to die for, with a sweet cinnamon taste. So don’t order tacos and skip the dry meat, and go for a tamale and horchata. The guacamole is really good as well. It’s fresh and just all around yummy.
The line is slow and when you are standing outside it gets hot.
But the staff is really nice, helpful, and patient.
But I wouldn’t come back because you can get just as good tamales at other places, the line is just NOT WORTH IT!<//Text>< Response>

I always go here when I’m in SB. It’s a non negotiable pit stop. It’s worth the wait in line. So fresh and delicious. I love watching them make tortillas. All the food is great and he horchata is also a must.</Text>

<review>Delicioso!!  The handmade tortillas are exceptional. Everything we ordered was crazy good! We were full and then we saw the people next to us had some amazing looking enchiladas  with a creamy sauce over them and found out that it was one of the specials of the day and of course we had to order it. We rolled out of there.  Warning the line is always long! So if you're in a hurry forget it<//review>< Rating>

When in Santa Barbara, do absolutely find the time to visit this little rugged tacqueria. The food here ia exquisite, from the home made tortillas to the tacos to the specials. Flush down your grub with their refreshing agua frescas, especially the cantaloupe one if on the specials board.< /Text>

This restaurant was ranked by Robb Report as one of the best 150 restaurants in the world. It was ranked number one of restaurants that serve on paper plates. Julia child said it was the best Mexican restaurant that she has been to. I have been going here since 1984. I have spent a ton of time in Mexico. This is the real deal for sure. As a tip, I would encourage you to ask for an extra half a dozen tortillas or so. They will charge you some minimal amount but it is well worth it.<//review>

I know this is famous, and I know I should have loved it, but honestly it was just okay for me. The meat and sauces didn't have much depth and I felt like they were more focused on making crowd-pleasing large plates/servings for families rather than really good quality smaller plates< /Review>

Wonderfully flavorful and unique food. I've been eating here for 30 years and never tire of the Super Rica Especial - the number 16. If you are want a beans and rice place, don't come here. If you want very fresh and tastes food that you don't get anywhere else - Super Rica is it. The line gets long, go early or later, not at peak times.< /text>

Food was amazing. Made fresh right in front of you. Decently priced for what you're getting was a slight wait, but that's expected in a place like this.< /review>

How do people even call this "Authentic" or "Mexican food" ? It is neither, it boggles my mind every time I pass by and there is a line out the door. There is real Mexican food along the Milpas corridor try one of those spots instead. Someone called this place "a hole in the wall" made me laugh...</text>

I think we ordered wrong, going for the basic tacos (simply meat on tortilla, and the meat not wonderful at that).  We each had one of the "special" tacos too, which were much more interesting and tasty - mine a blend of zucchini, cheese and pork; my husband's roasted mushrooms in a creamy sauce.  2 tacos was more than enough to fill us up - the portions are generous.  I'd go back for another try given the reputation, but would tend towards the specials and more "interesting" dishes on the menu - based on my experience, this is not a place for the basics.</Text>

Delicious and affordable Mexican food.  The items offered are more interesting than your typical Mexican restaurant, and the prices are very good for the quality.  There might be a small line at peak hours, but it moved fairly quickly.  All of the items are sold individually, so if you order 2 or 3 things that should be enough for one person.</Review>

So tasty - not your typical taco flavors at all. We had Tamal con Verduras, Beans & Guacamole. Everything was very flavorful. Be prepared for a wait - we stood in line for about 30 minutes before ordering. Food came out quickly once we ordered though. And it's worth the wait!< /review>

<Text>I went here by recommendation. I'm a Mexican visitor and this restaurant was good, when I was told this was the most amazing Mexican restaurant I would ever try. Not bad, but not that good. 4 stars for me is a good valuation.  I would go to Los Agaves restaurant (1 block away) if I wanted to try Mexican flavor 100% , but this one is more expensive.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Amazing, fresh corn tortillas. When ordering (or waiting for your order) you can see them being made-- and they're delicious.

Everything on the menu is fairly cheap, and the four or five items we tried were all fantastic. Will be back!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Wonderfully flavorful and unique food. I've been eating here for 30 years and never tire of the Super Rica Especial - the number 16. If you are want a beans and rice place, don't come here. If you want very fresh and tastes food that you don't get anywhere else - Super Rica is it. The line gets long, go early or later, not at peak times.</Review>

<review>Probably best restaurant in Santa Barbara (Oaxacan style Mexican food). Almost always a line and closed Tuesday and Wednesday but if the wait to order isn't more than 30 minutes, it's well worth it. Everything is hand made and fresh, some dishes are pretty spicy.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<text>Consistently great food, not your usual taco/burrito joint. Fresh ingredients, hot sauces on the side, hand made tortillas. There's a reason it was Julia's favorite place.</text>< date>

This place is totally legitimate. Everything in the menu is awesome, flavorful and interesting stuff. Plus, it's just a cool tent place to eat. Very low key and the food is unassailable.< /Text>

Low grade food! Tasteless dried out chicken and ‘steak’ if you can call it that. The popularity is the PRICE of the food, not the food itself.< /Text>

This is THE best food i've ever eaten in my life. It would be a crime if this place doesn't serve food throughout the rest of human existence. If you go during prime dinner hrs the line may be long. So just go to dinner a little earlier or later than usual.

Can't describe how much of a pleasure it is to eat these tacos. I make noises when I eat them because they are so good.< /text>

CASH ONLY. That was the only negative point. Had to walk BLOCKS to find an ATM. Luckily I got back just in time to order. and the food was AWESOME and very reasonably priced. Will definitely go back next time I'm in SB.</Text>

Yes, you have to try this place at least once. Don't be discouraged by the long line, and expect to wait for an open table. Bring cash because they don't accept cards or checks. My favorite is the chorizo with melted cheese served in a bowl with a side of tortillas. If they have any when you visit be sure to order the watermelon juice over ice!</text>

The best taco stand in Southern California.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't let that stop you from going inside.  Everything is great and they have a huge selection.  Get the Rajas and use it as a topping for other tacos.  Cash only.<//Text>

<review>Any place with a line out the door is a good indicator. I think what really for me pushes it to 5 stars is the prices are very fare. I usually order a number 1 and a 13 which are two beef tacos and like a  herself founded type thing with the tomatoes in it...oh and all the corn tortillas are fresh!< /review><GmapID>0x80e913828c602d77:0x3c604d53e5483c9c<//GmapID><resp>None</resp>< pics>

This place seems to be much more about reputation than good tacos. Not bad, but also not worth the inflated prices. I don't mind waiting in line for great food, but this wasn't it. Better tacos can be found all over SoCal for half as much, with no line.<//text>

Too good to be true. I'd eat here weekly if I lived close by. Just remember to come early to avoid the inevitable line!</Text>

Stopped by this super down-to-earth canteen style taqueria where the name says it all. Everything we had was super rica. Just don't expect anything fancy. This is the place to go for great and authentic Mexican food, spice it to your liking and grab some cool refrescos. Free parking in the street available. Great value for the money.</text>

Don't understand the positive reviews. The wait is interminable both before and after you order. Sure the food is fresh, but that means nothing if it is overcooked. The meat is consistently dry and the salsas are flavorless. I've heard their chilaquiles are to die for, but each time I've gone, they have run out! Not worth it.< /review>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>Amateur food wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. Especially me being from Mexican decent, a native to sb and more yet that I live around the block from this place. It only takes cash to top things off. And your better off going to Lilly’s tacos or corazón for tacos which are on a whole different level to these tacos. And if your looking for anything else Mexican walk to los agaves which you won’t be disappointed. Anyone that like there food don’t know what is true mexican cuisine is. This is a step up from Taco Bell or jack in the box and thats it. I’ve been to this place twice in my life and wish I never did. I would give the same rating to any fast food place.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

We love this place and can't wait to come each year when we visit from. Boston. My only feedback would be to encourage those dining alone to eat at tables together. It gets really crowded and tables disputes could be avoided.< /Text>

Still a huge fan after all these years.  The same owner has served me up for as long as I can remember.  Like visiting your best friend on vacation.  It may have lost my top spot to other places, I always enjoy my visit.</Text>

If Julia Child ate what I ate this place would no longer be her favorite taqueria. The tortillas are fresh made and the agua fresca was good but that's about all the good I can mentioned. tacos were no salt, no flavor, chewy meat, dry dry dry chicken. There were also paper thin tamales and  runny beans we only ate because we didn't finish the dry tacos. They probably leaving off their Julia Child glory. So many other places to eat great tacos in SB.</Review>

Love, love, love it!  But if you don't like standing in line waiting to place your order at the window, you better go somewhere else.  And I'd say it's really more like $-$$.  ¡Y si, La Super-Rica es la super rica!< /Text>

Love, love, love it!  But if you don't like standing in line waiting to place your order at the window, you better go somewhere else.  And I'd say it's really more like $-$$.  ¡Y si, La Super-Rica es la super rica!</Review>

If Julia Child ate what I ate this place would no longer be her favorite taqueria. The tortillas are fresh made and the agua fresca was good but that's about all the good I can mentioned. tacos were no salt, no flavor, chewy meat, dry dry dry chicken. There were also paper thin tamales and  runny beans we only ate because we didn't finish the dry tacos. They probably leaving off their Julia Child glory. So many other places to eat great tacos in SB.< /Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Amateur food wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. Especially me being from Mexican decent, a native to sb and more yet that I live around the block from this place. It only takes cash to top things off. And your better off going to Lilly’s tacos or corazón for tacos which are on a whole different level to these tacos. And if your looking for anything else Mexican walk to los agaves which you won’t be disappointed. Anyone that like there food don’t know what is true mexican cuisine is. This is a step up from Taco Bell or jack in the box and thats it. I’ve been to this place twice in my life and wish I never did. I would give the same rating to any fast food place.</text>< Pics>

Best hole-in-the-wall Mexican food in Santa Barbara! The rajas taco is my favorite, but everything is tasty and authentic. Tastes like your abuelita made it.</review>

Been coming here for years always loved it. The food has always been full of flavor that mixes perfectly with the hole in the wall asthetic. My personal favorites are the Chile relleno and the super Rica especial. Over all great :)</text>

Their Cafe de Olla (black coffee with cane sugar and cinammon), chile relleno with avocado cream, and rajas (I think) taco (grilled onions, chile strips, and cheese) are all unbelievable.

Oaxaqueno chicken tamale with mole is very good.

Costilla and other meat tacos were not as good showcases for this place's specialties, which - per the name - are the cream- and cheese-heavy dishes!</Review>

< Review>
Their Cafe de Olla (black coffee with cane sugar and cinammon), chile relleno with avocado cream, and rajas (I think) taco (grilled onions, chile strips, and cheese) are all unbelievable.

Oaxaqueno chicken tamale with mole is very good.

Costilla and other meat tacos were not as good showcases for this place's specialties, which - per the name - are the cream- and cheese-heavy dishes!</Review>

Tacos. Tacos, tacos, and more tacos. Tacos with hand-made tortillas while you wait! Get one of everything, because they are all fantastic. My favorite if I had to commit would be the chorizo tacos. Often a bit of a line, but it goes pretty fast. Gives you some time to decide what to get! Their small quesadillas are fantastic as well if you're a vegi person. Vegans need not apply.< /Text>

The world would be a lesser place without Superica taco. I don't care what anybody says, I make no exceptions, there is absolutely no argument against this position, but La Super Rica Taco is the finest taco restaurant on the face of planet Earth. No exceptions.</Review>

<text>Please note that Google's description of Super-Rica is incorrect. You will not find fish tacos here. I've been coming for more than 30 years. My family loves the sautéed beef and onion dishes. I love vegetarian options such as the chile relleno. They offer what I think of as home style Mexican food, not street tacos.</text><Rating>5<//Rating>< Resp>

<review>great food but the older guy over charges certain people, so watch him when you DON'T get your receipt.  he will put 3 instead of 2 tacos on big orders and when you question him, he re-does it really fast so you don't notice and feel rushed because they are so many people lined up.not a reason to stay away--just notice the billing .<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
Mexican food in California has significantly changed since Julia Child endorsed La Super-Rica Taqueria as her favorite place to eat in Santa Barbara. How has this no-frills teal-colored Mexican outpost stood up to time? Is it worth a visit, or shockingly over-rated?

I would personally not wait in the reportedly insane peak-hour lines to eat here, but I’d definitely return for an early Wednesday lunch when it opens at 11am, rubbing elbows with local newspaper-wielding seniors, which is exactly what I did when I visited La Super-Rica Taqueria. There was virtually no line, and I was eating within 10 minutes of my arrival.

The “Super-Rica Especial” was the most expensive dish on the menu at $6.80, but worth it. Chunks of al pastor pork that have been marinated all-day share a plate with fire-roasted pasilla peppers stuffed with queso that melts and tastes like a Oaxacan cheese or dry mozzarella (and could actually be one or the other). The cheese acts as a binding agent, tempting attacking forks to pick up cheese, pepper, and meat all at once. With just a hint of delightful piquancy in each bite, this humble dish is not about heat as much as it is about the earthy, lush, multi-layered flavors of a Mexican home. The “Super-Rica Especial” is grade A certified “comida de abuela.”

I was much less impressed by the “Frijol Super-Rica,” which is perhaps unfair, given the fact it is a side dish advertised merely as pinto beans with chorizo, bacon, and chilies, and is offered at a measly $2.55. However, I'd expect these beans to be more strongly flavored than they are with the chilies and pork products, but they’re just slightly-above-average pinto beans by southern Californian standards.

I have admittedly been long-intrigued by the surprising shout out to “La Super-Rica Taqueria” in the second verse of Katy Perry’s “This is How We Do.” I must confess, I too was tantalized by the possibility of a wild night at this Santa Barbara institution, “scarfin’ tacos,” and “checkin’ out hotties.” But I can assure you, my friends, this really isn’t that kind of place, and hopefully never will be.</Review>

Maybe it's because we are locals to LA but besides the hand pressed tortillas this Taqueria's long wait is simply not special enough for a second visit in my opinion.</text>

Get ready to wait but it will be worth it. Handmade tortillas and a small indoor / outdoor seating area make this one of my favorite restaurants in SB.</Review>

< Review>
Last night I came here was my 1st time and I left a bit disappointed for 2 reasons. 1st reason is that even though I came early (around 6 pm) n there wasn't a line when I ordered, it took 30 mins to get my 5 tacos n 2 quesadillas ( i was starting to think they had gone to kill the cow...) and I wasn't the only one waiting a long while for my food, there was several other people  2nd reason was that when I finally got my food, the meat had little flavor. The only positive thing I can say is that the tortillas are fresh, hand made then n there. I doubt I'll be going back<//Review>

<Text>This is one of the lite gems of Santa Barbara. Even though this isn't your cheapest street taco spot it makes up for the 3 dollar price tag with enough meat to turn each taco into 2, wrapped in their signature made to order corn tortillas  that to my surprise had more of a  I usually go with the OG carne asada tacos with a healthy helping of their fresh pico de galo and salsa for an extra kick. To me the way the meat is cooked in combo with the fresh made tortillas make it worth a stop and a cut above the other Mexican food places (except for Los Agaves which is my favorite at the moment).</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>La Super-Rica Taqueria does not have any fish on the menu and they only have one vegetarian option, which I ordered. It was a disappointingly bland stuffed chili relleno. Unfortunately, Santa Barbara does not have one taco joint that compares to the amazing taco joints in San Francisco –– even La Esquina in NYC has better tacos! And for truly unique home cooked Mexican food nothing in Santa Barbara compares to Nopalito SF. Santa Barbara also does not have one good Napoletana pizzeria. So, there are opportunities here, if you're so inclined.</Text><user_id>102135863668617632128< /user_id>< response>

<resp>None< /resp><Text>This is very clearly a favored spot. We arrived to a long line with no one complaining about being in the line. I got a adovoda, chicken, and chorizo tacos. All the meats were pretty good with chorizo being my favorite of the three. I was expecting diced onion and cilantro on the tacos but instead they have a salsa bar with pico. I mixed the pico with the two salsas, it was tasty.<//Text><user>114315732571237168300< /user>< Pictures>

I am visiting from San Diego, CA and my wife and I decided to try this place for it's rave reviews. We got the tacos de bistec and adobada, 2 sides of guacamole, an agua de horchata and an agua de Jamaica. The meat was dry and flavorless. I am Mexican and these tacos put my culture to shame. Maybe I'm spoiled because in San Diego we have great Mexican food all over town. My wife and I were definitely disappointed and surprised with the great reviews this place had. P.s. guacamole was good and my horchata, that's about it.</text>

<text>This is a great little place in Santa Barbara. We arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes before it opened and people were already lined up to order.

The food was delicious and very affordable. I had the Alambre de Filette and Pozole ad both were good.

There were so many people eating at the restaurant by the time we left, people were standing around waiting for open tables and for people to leave.

I would definitely visit this place again when I visit Santa Barbara<//text><Rate>4</Rate></record></dataset><record>

<Text>La Super Rica seems to be the most talked-about taqueria in Santa Barbara; whether that talk is positive is a different story.  Some say it is worth the wait.  Some say it's good but you can do better.  Some say it's terrible.  What cannot be disputed is that most people know about it, and that the reviews skew positively.  It is a brighly colored white shack with teal trim, and a line that stretches out the door.  Inside there is a fair amount of seating at basic wooden tables with white chairs.  Service is relatively fast (for Cali at least) as well as friendly, so the line should move fast--except when someone makes a huge order.  Everything--including the tortillas-is made fresh, and the prices are only a little north of what you typically see at taquerias.  Controversy aside, I like the place a lot.  La Super Rica was so good the first time I went, that I came back a second time before my flight back home.  During those 2 visits, I tried the following with overlap: tacos con chorizo, rajas, tacos con bistec, alamore de pechuga, huarache and guacamole.  First off, the homemade tortillas are heavenly; they almost make the restaurant alone.  But there is no doubting the quality of the ingredients used here.  The only issue lies in how they are used sometimes.  The standouts were the rajas in particular.  Maybe it was the seasoning they used, but this combo of cheese and peppers was addictive; combine it with a meat, and you're golden.  The alamore de pechuga/chicken came with peppers and onions, and worked perfectly on the tacos.  The chorizo was greasy and lightly fried in its own fat from its time on the grill, but not as spicy as I would've liked.  Similarly, the tacos con bistec were good but the steak tasted a bit plain compared to other dishes.  The guacamole was great the first time I had it, and just good the second time.  Their salsa bar has 3 salsas: one red, one green and one that is just chopped onions, tomatoes and peppers with cilantro.  Go with the latter, as it is fresh and tasty whereas the other 2 were very muted in their flavors.  The huarache was the best I've had, bar none.<//Text></record>

After hearing and reading all the hype from this place my husband and I (new SB residents)  with my family decided to try this place out. We waited in line for 20+ mins because there's only one person taking orders. After we all ordered it came out close to $85 for 6 of us. Which I personally think was a bit ridiculous. We waited another 20+min for our food. I ordered their pozole and steak Tacos which btw don't come with onion cilantro and lime you have to ask for it. My hubby got their Chile relleno which was the only flavorful thing we all ordered . My parents got the "chorizo" tacos which was really Italian sausage links . So overall of you're expecting your grandma's or mom's style cooking don't come here. It's a very Americanized Mexican food joint. Would I come here again? No.<//text>

Quick Trip up the coast, and decided to re-visit La Super-Rica again.   First visit was around 5 years ago.

The line is still there.....we waited in the hot sun while the line of 20-30 people slowly (very slowly) made its way to the counter to order.    The line seemed to go very slow because half of the people there were out of town (us) tourists (not us) who read about this place on review sites, but were unfamiliar with the food, so they had to pepper the order taker (owner?) with multiple questions before ordering.

Our order was simple -- Pozole, Tamal, and Taco.

Tamal was a bit expensive and mostly dough, but the corn sauce covering it was excellent....you could really taste the fresh corn flavor.

The taco was good....better than most street tacos, but a bit more expensive too.

The pozole was excellent....best I've had for a long time!    Good balance between the hominy, meat, and veggies in perfectly spiced soup.    This made the wait worth it!

So, next time, I'll get the pozole for sure, but will probably pass on the fish tamal and the street taco.< /Text>

Cliche as it is. Julia was not wrong. Their chile con queso makes me weep. Just made tortillas with a hunk of melted cheese and a perfectly seared poblano, top it with their homemade pico de gallo, and perfection.<//Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>I don't understand the hype with this place.  Julia Child endorsed it and now everyone has jumped on the bandwagon and acts as though it's some kind of institution for great Mexican food.  It is one of the worst Mexican restaurants in Santa Barbara.  There's nothing special about the food, except that it is bare and unexciting, and the location being five feet from a busy street, with fly-ravaged seating on cheap patio furniture that seldom gets cleaned, under a roof of corrugated plastic, may trick people into thinking it's a locals-only bastion of authentic food, but the food is the worst part.  If you order a carne asada taco, for example, you get a crumbling corn tortilla with a handful of carne asada.  That's it.  Go here if you want a sub-mediocre experience, but don't get suckered in by the hype and believe this is good Mexican food.< /review></record>

< review>
Los Arroyos is better and I prefer the Rose Cafe on the mesa rather than the one downtown Rose Cafe 2. I'm 12th generation born and raised here in Montecito and my dads mexicano, chicano and my moms jewish, so I have the best of both worlds. Comida De Mexicano is just average here in town because in LA you have the trucks and great places!!! that I go to when I leave paradise here!! my bro's come over to my casa here in Monticeto because my abuelita on my dads side Josephina ran a restaurant in the 1930's and she said that on state street during that period different lamps were placed out front designating what was being served like a green lantern meant "Chlil Verde" and a yellow lantern meant "Carnitas" and all those mole recipes and tacos were passed down and I'm licking my fingers as we speak. Cuca's is totally overrated, most locals don't go there. My grandmothers next door neighbor was Julia Child's here in Montecito and my granny use to go there to La Super Rica a lot with Julia and please don't get me wrong but as soon as the celebrities got the green light,it became nirvana, mistake!!!!! go to the Rose Cafe on the Mesa or Los Arroyo's or even one of the many locations of "Rudy's", like the one on Montecito street and Bath street or upper state. I'm not a tourist and most locals will tell you the best places to go. La Super Rica is quite expensive also, one $ is a misrepresentation! even Steve Martin, Jonathan Winters and other local celebrities frequent the Rose Cafe on the mesa. Bill Clinton ate here at Rose Cafe when campaigning before he became the man!!! and its up on the mesa,away from all the tourist spots. Rudy's is killer the jumbo chicken fajitas burrito is insane,man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and the salsa's are picante. mi hambre!!! la semana que entra mi gente's.< /review>

The tacos, guacamole, queso fundido, quesadillas, everything handmade and was super delicious. It is no wonder they always have a line but totally worth the wait (which was not long). Will be back for sure, whether we stay in SB or are driving through, found our spot for sure.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) It is very tasty but very poorly served more staff the owner wants to serve collect and cook at the same time and leaves people for hours waiting

(Translated by Google) Worth waiting for!

The recommended in Forbes Mag Taqueria is only for patient people, after all, we had our food after about 1 hour. We had To Go, as it is much more comfortable on our hotel balcony and not so loud. Noise-sensitive people I recommend doing the same thing.

As had # 1 (4 *) and # 6 (4 5 *) # 12 (5 *) and # 18 (5 *) - the asterisk is subjective as yummie we found it. Remember to pack the tomato salsa / salad, a must to eat - unless you do not like cilantro :-)

Whose long wait is nothing, do not worry - there are many great taquerias who are different but also great.

(Original)
Warten lohnt sich!

Die im Forbes Mag empfohlene Taqueria ist nur für geduldige Menschen, immerhin hatten wir nach ca. 1h unser Essen. Dies hatten wir To Go, da es auf unserem Hotelbalkon deutlich gemütlicher ist und nicht so laut. Lärmempfindlichen Menschen empfehle ich Gleiches zu tun.

Wie hatten Nr. 1 (4*) und Nr. 6 (4 5*) Nr. 12 (5*) und Nr. 18 (5*) - die Sternchen ist subjektiv wie yummie wir es fanden. Denkt daran die Tomatensalsa/salat einzupacken, ein Muss zum Essen - außer ihr mögt keinen Koriander :-)

Wem langes Warten nichts ist, keine Sorge - es gibt viele klasse Taquerias, die zwar anders, aber auch super sind.< /Review>
